During that time, we have worked with multiple factories and international freight companies to ensure our high-quality games are delivered on-time and in excellent condition. For this Kickstarter, we are working with experienced partners like Quartermaster Logistics to continue that pattern of quality.\n\nWe are estimating a May 2022 delivery date for this game, but please keep in mind this is only an estimate. There are always elements beyond our control when working with manufacturers, such as virus outbreaks, production delays, shipping delays, and delays with customs. Should these occur, we will make sure that we quickly communicate any delay or challenge and keep our backers updated.\n\nIn addition, the game has already gone through substantial production, which further limits the chances for delays. The artwork is mostly complete, the plastics have been sculpted, and many components are at or near a print-ready state.

If this is your first Meeple Source Kickstarter project, welcome! And if it isn't, welcome back!\nThis is our 15th Kickstarter project, so it really means something when we say that this project includes the most exciting variety of game upgrades to date. We hope that you will pull up a chair, stay a while, and take this journey with us.\nThis is expected to be our only Kickstarter project in 2021, so we are giving you everything we've got! We have new upgrades for popular series like Scythe, Wingspan, and The West Kingdom Trilogy. We're adding beautiful pieces to our line of upgrades for Lords of Waterdeep, Pandemic, Carcassonne, Concordia, Caverna, Agricola, and Grand Austria Hotel. Hot new games are definitely represented here as well, with sets designed especially for Lost Ruins of Arnak, Obsession, Darwin's Journey, Creature Comforts, Hallertau, Bonfire, New York Zoo, Dominant Species: Marine, Tekhenu, and Tawantinsuyu. And that's not all! Isle of Cats, Taverns of Tiefenthal, Fields of Arle, Carpe Diem, Keyper, Keyflower: The Farmers, and Key Market, Dice Settlers, A Feast for Odin, Cat Lady, Clans of Caledonia, Wendake, Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small, Reykholt, and Underwater Cities are all shown some massive love in this project!\nWith so many game upgrades offered in this project (and likely a few more to come along the way), we are offering some of our pledge levels in a different way than we have in the past. We are calling these first few upgrades \"Featured Pledge Levels\", and you can pledge for them by simply browsing the list of Kickstarter pledge levels and selecting it, just as you normally would with any Kickstarter project. If you scroll down further, you will get to the \"Additional Game Upgrades\" pledge level, which will be used for all of the other upgrades.\nAll of the other game upgrades, including partial sets (when shown as a project option), are being combined in the \"Additional Game Upgrades\" pledge level, which shows a cost of $1. You can/should still pledge for the combined amount for your desired game upgrades. Although different from the way we have done this in the past, we are hoping that a simplified format will make a project with as many options as this easier to navigate.\nIn Kickstarter, you will only choose one pledge level as your primary pledge, but it is certainly possible to pledge for multiple things here.  To do so, simply select one of the upgrades as your \"main pledge level\", then select \"add-ons\" for your other upgrade(s) you want as well. Additionally, there will be an intuitive process in BackerKit (the post-project order management and survey software we use) to handle the multiple upgrades and choices. You can take advantage of our flat-rate shipping offer by bundling an unlimited number of upgrades from this project with no additional shipping cost.\nThe popularity of flat-rate shipping cannot be understated, so that's what we're doing. The amount varies by country, but the shipping amount is fixed, no matter how many upgrades and add-ons you pledge for. The flat shipping rate within the United States is $7, and other countries have a flat rate of $9-$15.\nWe don't want anything to stand between you and these really fantastic game upgrades. That is why we offer all of our Kickstarter backers an unconditional money-back guarantee (within 30 days of receiving your pieces). Your only responsibility would be the return shipping, but that is typically inexpensive, as the pieces are small and light. We are that confident that you\u2019ll love \u2018em!\nAll orders are quality-controlled, packaged, and shipped with care from the Meeple Source lair in Orlando, FL. We do not use any outside fulfillment centers, here in the US or internationally. \nEven though inexpensive worldwide shipping is available for this project, if there are any import duties and/or fees owed at delivery, these are still your responsibility. This used to only rarely happen though, based on the declared value, size, and weight of packages of this kind. BUT, things are changing, at least in some countries. Read on...\nIf we are required to collect VAT for your order before the project ships, that cost will be collected in BackerKit (our chosen post-project management/fulfillment tool). This will almost certainly be necessary for UK backers (see more below), and likely EU backers as well. If at the point we need to collect the VAT for your shipment, you are unhappy with the amount or process, you will have the opportunity to cancel some or all of your pledge, but we will have to reduce the refund at that time by the amount of the non-refundable Kickstarter fees for your transaction. \n2021 has already seen huge changes in transit, tariffs, and international business. We are running this project in good faith, and will be transparent with what needs to happen to get you the fancy upgrades that you desire! :-) \nThere are also a number of countries that we are not able to ship to, due to known limitations and/or difficulty delivering successfully in the past. The list of countries that we CAN ship to are: United States, Canada, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, and Thailand. Other than the UK (see special circumstances below), if you don't live in one of these countries, pledging for this project will be difficult. Options that you may have are to combine your order with a friend who lives in a serviced country, or to use a US-based mail/package forwarding service. There are many out there, and some of our customers from around the world use them regularly. \nYou might be aware that we are not currently shipping to the UK on our website. We hope to change this soon, but Brexit-related changes to importing/exporting (at least for small companies such as ourselves) have proven maddening. Our distinct expectation is that it will be a thing of the past by the time we are fulfilling this project. Assuming so, we will have to collect the VAT for your pledge, and will file that on your behalf at that time (resulting in a seamless and fee-free delivery). But, if we are unable to accomplish this, we will refund 100% of your pledge (we will absorb the Kickstarter fees mentioned above, in this case). For a variety of reasons though, we would like you to make your pledge (no matter what it's for) as a $1 (+shipping) pledge in the \"UK Backers Only\" pledge level. We can sort everything else out with you individually in BackerKit afterward. We apologize for this admittedly wonky process, but our alternative was to exclude UK backers from the project, which we really didn't want to do.\nMeeple Source is a family owned and operated company from Orlando, FL. Siblings Chris and Cynthia Landon are the founders, and remain in primary operational roles today. If you ever stop by our booth at conventions (in a non-COVID year!), you'll see the whole Landon family helping out - along with some friends that are as close as family!\nThe artist for most of these upgrades is Jamie Noble Frier, who also designed our Wingspan birds, Raiders of the North Sea upgrades, Architects of the West Kingdom meeples, as well as a number of our other more recent upgrades! \nWe are also excited to offer a set of meeples by a guest artist for Darwin's Journey, Paolo Voto, who is the artist for the game itself!\nAt this point, you have almost surely seen some of our past work, or even own some yourself. Nonetheless, here are just a few of our beautiful upgrade kits from past projects, starting with our a few of our most recent upgrades...\nWingspan: Oceania Bird Meeples\nNectar Tokens for Wingspan: Oceania\nPaladins of the West Kingdom Meeples\nRaiders of the North Sea Meeples\nResources for Raiders of the North Sea\nTomesaga/Overlord Meeples for Viscounts of the West Kingdom", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMeeple Source has been making detailed, full-color Character Meeples for over nine years now, and other painted components longer than that. We are proud to say that we have a reputation for high quality pieces and great customer service.\n\nEven with the success of our 14 completed Kickstarter projects to date, we are still a very small, family-run company that takes great pride in taking care of our customers and their orders personally. We quality-control every meeple individually by hand and ship all orders in-house, and we also use a post-project management system (typically BackerKit) which helps keep everything orderly.\n\nIf you are one of our many repeat Kickstarter backers, you probably know that we are very straight-forward with regard to the progress of our projects, and will let you know if we encounter any delays. We did have an unfortunate technological hiccup with regard to Kickstarter emails/messages during the final phase of fulfillment of our last project, and can assure you that we will pay closer attention than ever, and won't have a lapse in response like we did at that time. \n\nWe believe that we have allotted enough time in the production and delivery schedule to account for the types of situations that could arise, but unexpected delays are still always possible. Our last few Kickstarter projects delivered early, and although this could occur again, we obviously can't promise that.\n\nMore than anything, we are committed to quality. Our past customers know that this is true, and our Kickstarter backers know that we offer a money-back guarantee on all pledges. So don't worry, we've got this!\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you agree to conduct all public interactions via Kickstarter's communications channels with this project and our team and other backers in a positive manner. Harassment, name-calling, or attempts to inject inappropriate content into the public communications channels will not be tolerated. Meeple Source reserves the right to cancel any pledge, although we have never had to exercise this right in the past.\n\nAny VAT that Meeple Source is required to collect and remit on your behalf will be collected in BackerKit (the 3rd party pledge manager that we use) - it is not already built-in to the listed prices on Kickstarter that are applicable to all backers.\n\nIf we ship to the address that you provided in BackerKit and the package is returned to us as undeliverable, you may be required to pay the full cost to ship your reward again to a revised address.\n\nIf we ship your reward to the address you provided in BackerKit and the package tracking status shows as delivered to that address, but you are unable to receive it, or you have moved and are no longer the occupant of that address and cannot otherwise retrieve the package, or if the package is lost or stolen after delivery, and you wish to have the order fulfilled again, you may be required to pay the full cost to ship the order to a revised address in addition to the amount of the original reward including any selected add-ons.\n\nIf we ship the reward to the address you provided in BackerKit and the package is held in customs or by any other government agency, our ability to help may be limited. You may be required to contact your customs agency or government and arrange for the package to be cleared and released at your expense. We are not responsible for any fees levied against your pledge by customs or any government agency. We are not responsible for any refunds or re-shipments for packages held by customs or a government agency.\n\nOther than as noted elsewhere in these terms & conditions, if any part of your order cannot be fulfilled for any reason, Meeple Source will provide you with a pro-rated refund for that portion of your order.\n\nIf you do not log in to BackerKit and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. If you need more time to complete your BackerKit survey, you must contact us. Meeple Source reserves the right to deny or fulfill orders beyond these 8 weeks under our discretion. If you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into the BackerKit system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge for this project.\n\nIf you have questions or concerns about these terms & conditions please email meeplesource@gmail.com for further information.

It seems that Kickstarter was actively changing the way that looked to backers even throughout the day of our last update. In the morning, the app showed add-on money as \"bonus\" money and described it in a way that made it sound like it was a donation, not support in exchange for rewards. The website still worked the \"old way\" where you could simply change your pledge dollar amount. But by the end of that day, both the website and app were both showing \"bonus money\" as the only way to add funds to your pledge. We don't expect any donations, don't worry!

Taking inspiration from countless hours of Anime, LokDown will allow players to enjoy the bombastic conflicts, colorful atmosphere, magical heroes, and amazing worlds found in the best Anime, while also crafting your own deep and well-versed characters (or just go with a tormented edge lord or a nerdy/shy-yet-still-charming high schooler with a destiny) to inhabit them.\nCheck it out Now!\nBut please, you do not have to take our word for it. We have an early version we are releasing, for free, so people can see what the game is about. There are over 170 pages of content showing you what LokDown will be. It has everything you need to begin exploring the LokDown world!\n  LokDown Early Edition Free Download! 180 pages of Anime TTRPG Awesomeness \nThe Luminous Dawn\nWhen the Calamity struck, the Luminous Dawn Settlement Fleet was mid-transit to an uninhabited world, well past the edges of Neo-Spine Space. Controls failed; life support systems faltered. In short, the 100,000 inhabitants of the escaping fleet were destined to die.\nThrough frantic effort, onboard engineers managed to repair basic life support systems, allowing the fleeing fleet's crews and their families to enter into stasis chambers, hoping to sleep out the danger until a rescue could be found. All four ships were linked to the controls of Admiral Keanu Lok, commander of the Luminous Dawn. He alone would stay awake, and he alone would determine all of their fates.\nBut what quickly became clear to Admiral Lok was there would be no rescue. After the Calamity, there was not a ship in the empire or perhaps even the entire galaxy that could find them. So, while they slept without dreams, Keanu Lok guided the fleet through the void of space on only the most basic of gravitational controls, completely alone, and without hope.\nPlanet LokDown\nWhen the alarms blared, announcing the end of stasis, the crews and their families slowly awoke to find their vessels had all crashed on a strange alien world. The only message from Admiral Lok: A call for hope, a plea for determination, and an inspiring farewell. He placed their ship on the best course he could towards an inhabitable world they would not reach for over 2,000 years. They found Admiral Lok\u2019s ancient mummified corpse still at the controls and gave him a burial in the planet he had died getting them to.\nThe world Admiral Lok found was tidally locked in orbit around its star. One sweltering side perpetually faced the sun, and the other in permanent frozen darkness. Only a narrow ring circling the planet from pole to pole, in perpetual twilight was inhabitable: The Eventide Steppes. Millennia ago, Admiral Lok had managed to somehow place the Luminous Dawn Settlement Fleet inside this narrow habitable zone on the northern hemisphere.\nDubbing the world LokDown, the peoples of the Luminous Dawn Fleet set about finding a means of surviving their new, brutal home. The ships that had ferried them for millennia were damaged beyond repair, and the precious fuel sources needed to propel them, completely spent. While able to support life in several forms, LokDown proved to be as hostile a life-sustaining world as any on record. The atmosphere was breathable, if barely. The wildlife was savage, and on par with the bio-engineered attack creatures bred for war in the Old Empire. The native peoples found on LokDown, while not necessarily hostile, were of little assistance, nearly impossible to track, and the closest translation they could work out of their name was Daemon.\nWorst of all, a thronging creature, later named murk swarms, moved in great grey masses across the Eventide Vale devouring everything, even the hulls of their colony ships. Without a means of adapting, the survivors of the crash would soon be left perpetually exposed to the harsh environment until they were devoured, one way or another.\n\nThe Adaptions\nEach ship had different specialties, and among the migrants were some of the greatest adaptive scientists in existence. In a desperate attempt to survive LokDown, the research teams set about devising means to adapt their peoples' bodies into something more viable with their new home. While most attempts failed, some with brutal outcomes, four methods of survival were invented, allowing the peoples of Luminous Dawn to live, if not unchanged.\n\nThe Quantum Geologists of the fleet discovered means of strengthening their own bodies with the native elements of LokDown creating the Godai. The biogeneticists used DNA samples from the hearty creatures native to LokDown to create the Shastra, near perfect hybrids of sapient and beast. Several of the engineers managed to adapt technology traded from the Daemons to create the Xenotons, a bionic people of metal merged with flesh. The last team used tissue samples from the Daemons themselves to create genetic hybrids, known as the Bloodbourne; fiendish looking people in appearance but not of heart.\nWhere We Stand Now\nAble to survive LokDown, but unable to leave, the four peoples of LokDown set about the most arduous part of their task: Making this new world into a home. Generations passed which had never seen a star, but the stories of the endless voids, filled with long lost peoples, never faded from the hearts and dreams of their souls. \n\n\nThe Setting\nLokDown takes place in the Reknown-Galaxy, and is part of the Carbyne Jungle universe. Unlike most expansions however, LokDown is designed to also work as a Stand-Alone game. So if you are a fan of Carbyne Jungle, you can use all of these options with your current campaigns. If Carbyne Jungle is new to you, no worries. You can enjoy all of LokDown without needing any other book or materials.\nLokDown is built on the Tri-Forge Engine, the same game system as Carbyne Jungle, an exciting action filled experience with customizable rulesets, and incredibly flexible advancement. With the Tri-Forge Engine, you can customize the rules to fit your table and use the simplified ruleset of Flip&Fight to introduce new players, all without slowing down your game. \nLokdown is designed to be a stand-alone game, but it can also work with Carbyne Jungle. So, you can use your LokDown characters in your Carbyne Jungle campaigns or Vice Versa.\nAnd if you have never tried Carbyne Jungle (or our Carbyne Jungle Mission Decks which are just absolutely amazing), we have good news! You can add those onto any Kickstarter order!\nWhat kind of setting is LokDown?\nLokDown is an Anime-Inspired Sci-Fantasy setting, meaning it has elements of Science Fiction, Fantasy, and a whole lot of goodies drawn straight from some of your favorite Anime/Manga series. We choose Sci-Fantasy because it has the most options. With a Sci-Fantasy setting, there is no limit on what you can create or who you can be.\nAt the same time, we know many players prefer a specific era or tech level to their games, so LokDown will also come with tools for running games in Classic Fantasy, Modern, or Straight Sci-Fi (no magic) settings. On top of that, we have optional rulesets for tables that want to emphasize a Shonen, Mecha, Cyberpunk Noir, or Cosmic Horror feel to their game. \nShort Version: You can run whatever you want, and we will give you the tools to make it fun.\n We Have Funded!!!\nWe've hit our goal, but we are not done! We still are reaching towards our stretch goals! In them, we will expand the premade campaign with the game and add in some special goodies: Our first is the Kaiju Invasion! With this comes a Mission Deck where parties will use special gear and tactics to try to stop the Kaiju attacking the Eventide Steppes. With the Mission Deck, every Kaiju will be a different random monster that provides a new challenge every time!\n\nWhat Will Be Added to the Early Edition?\nPlenty! While the Free Early Edition you can download above has some amazing stuff, the final release will have a ton more content. For starters, there will be 2 full books: A Player's Guide and a GM's Guide. There will be more lore, character options, monsters, setting details, and a full campaign. The final version will also have the Flip&Fight ruleset: a streamlined system designed for new players with simplified rules. Flip&Fight is designed to be played alongside the standard rulesets so new players can jump into a game with experienced players, enjoy the fun, and not feel overwhelmed.\nThat's right! You can get your favorite character into the LokDown Core Rulebooks! Choose the Shapeshifter package and on top of getting digital copies of all the stuff, you also get to create an NPC for the game! Take your favorite PC (or just a character idea that you like), and we will work with you on adding it to LokDown. Not only that, but that NPC will play a part in the campaign built for the LokDown GM's Guide. \nThe standard Shapeshifter package comes with digital copies of all books, but with Kickstarter's new Add-On feature, you can add physical copies of whatever books you want to go with it!\nNow, you can customize every Backer Package with Add-Ons! Once you click on the reward you want, you can customizing it by adding more copies of books or other related products such as the Carbyne Jungle Core Rulebook or the Haedus 8B Mission Decks which all work with LokDown!\n Shipping to unlisted countries\nWe will ship to any country in the world. To avoid over charging for shipping (and listing 110 nations on each option), we listed the most common countries we have received orders from previously. If you're country is not listed, shoot us a message and which packages you are thinking about, and we will setup the shipping prices for you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be our 3rd Kickstarter now, and we have delivered both previous projects on time despite one taking place in 2020 (gestures at everything).

Players take the role of fantasy heroes: facing challenges, adventuring through the realm of Ulos, and making decisions that change the story \u2014 and the kingdom \u2014 forever.\nAfter a thousand years of peace, Dragul armies raided from the north, prompting you and every other loyal citizen of Nalos to sign up as soldiers of the King\u2019s Guard. The armies of Nalos fought long and hard against the North\u2019s monstrous generals and their minions, finally turning the tide of the Dragul Invasion.\nIn each of the game's 12 storybooks, you\u2019ll be asked to make choices, complete skill checks, and fight battles that will permanently alter the world of Ulos for that adventure and in future adventures. You\u2019ll find new allies, make enemies, and uncover secrets that will change the world around you.\nWhatever choices you make, someone will remember \u2014 and respond.\nChoose from one of 21 pregenerated characters, or import a favorite Roll Player character and take them on a heroic journey. Each character brings unique attributes, starting cards, class abilities, and backstories to your adventure.\nPregenerated Characters\nImporting Characters from Roll Player\nRoll Player Adventures does NOT require the Roll Player base game or any of its expansions to play, though it\u2019s possible to import characters generated in Roll Player using any number of its expansions. Do you have a favorite Obnoxious Saurian Fighter who grew up as a Street Urchin from your last game of Roll Player? Bring them along\nEach of the 17 races and 36 classes have unique portraits and class abilities in Adventures!\nConvert your attribute scores and use them to build dice pools during your adventure!\nEvery market card from Roll Player has a new dice-manipulating counterpart in Roll Player Adventures!\n Note: Roll Player products will be available individually in the pledge manager.\nRoll Player Adventures has 11 adventure books that form a continuous campaign, and 1 infinitely replayable sidequest that can be played at any time. In a session of Roll Player Adventures, you\u2019ll explore a new area of the world of Ulos, represented by a unique adventure map. As your party travels around the map, you\u2019ll read aloud from that adventure\u2019s storybook and choose how you\u2019ll approach each encounter.\nDuring your adventure, you'll encounter strange creatures, solve puzzles and mysteries, and discover new areas of the map to explore.\nRoll Player Adventures blends an immersive branching narrative with cooperative skill checks and combat encounters. These dice placement puzzles echo the satisfying, puzzle-solving features of other Thunderworks Games hits such as Roll Player and Cartographers: A Roll Player Tale. In each combat or skill check, players manage their resources to fill dice slots with dice of specific colors and numbers. With clever play and the players can attempt to overcome the obstacles on the path of adventure.\n\nSpend stamina from your character\u2019s attributes to add specific colors of dice to the dice pool: \nThen play cards from your hand to manipulate the dice and solve the puzzle:\nIf you lose a combat or fail a skill check, there\u2019s no replaying a scenario or rolling up new characters. You now need to deal with the consequences of your failure, and see how the world changes in response. Even death is a new adventure \u2014 with its own 10-encounter storyline.\nRoll Player Adventures has several systems dedicated to remembering the results of your actions. Together, they represent an incredible amount of responsiveness from the game world to player choices. Importantly, these systems also can interact with each other, giving nuance to relationships \u2014 you may choose to gain a temporary ally in an adventure, but be regarded by them differently because you\u2019ve offended their faction in the past.\nAt the end of each adventure, you\u2019ll spend your earned gold and experience points to advance your characters, improving your party for the next adventure. There are 100's of unique abilities to discover and many ways to specialize.\nWant to try Roll Player Adventures for yourself? You can play through a draft of Adventure 1: Battle at Blacklake on both Tabletopia (Free!) and Tabletop Simulator. \n Rahdo Runs Through - Runthrough\nThe Nefras's Judgement expansion is available as part of the Immortal Knight and World of Ulos pledge levels. In this expansion, Nefras, the Snake of Years, will judge each character in your party as they make personal choices that are woven through the storyline of your campaign. Uncover your backstory and choose your alignment in Roll Player Adventures: Nefras\u2019s Judgement.\nDuring a campaign including Nefras's Judgement, each character in your party plays through one unique backstory quest that spans across multiple adventure books.\nFor example, if a character in your party had a \u201cDetective\u201d Backstory, you might slowly uncover clues about a murder, scattered through the adventures in the main campaign, finally either solving the mystery or sending an innocent insectoid to Kulbak prison in the storyline's climax.\nWhen setting up the Nefras\u2019s Judgement expansion at the start of a Roll Player Adventures campaign, players can use the backstory provided with a pregenerated character, or they can import the backstory and alignment from a character built using Roll Player.\nAs with previous projects, we'll be shipping all pledge levels from reputable fulfillment partners around the world.

This means that rewards bound to those regions ship from within their respective regions so backers in those regions will not pay any VAT, customs, or duties on their games upon arrival at their address.

It's still the same great mechanics you've loved for over 10 years, now in a special, limited edition that includes all new art, plastic Walls and Towers for the Castle, plastic Monster minis that feature a unique spinning base to track damage, wooden Monster tokens, and more!\nCastle Panic is a cooperative game for 1 to 6 players where everyone is working together to defend the castle from monsters coming in from the forest. The players must make it through all 49 Monster tokens and have at least 1 tower still standing in order to win the game. If the monsters destroy all 6 towers, the game ends and the monsters win.\n Castle Panic Deluxe takes everything you love about the standard version of Castle Panic and makes it, well, deluxe! \nAll minis figures come assembled but will need their damage bases attached. Don't worry, this is a snap! All plastics will come unpainted, ready for your painterly goodness! \n*Note: All images not final and not to scale. All components and upgrades subject to change.\nThis pledge level is only available to verified game stores. Verification will require detailed store information including EIN number. The verification process will be at the discretion of Fireside Games and the results will be final. When the campaign ends, you will have access to our pledge manager, where your pledge will be applied as a credit towards your order. Orders will be at a 50% discount and must be in case quantities (3 games per case). Your final order and payment will be determined when the game is ready to ship. Retail orders will be shipped at the same time as all other Kickstarter orders.\nShipping to be charged after the end of the campaign.\nPlease contact sales@firesidegames.com for more information. \nNOTE: The standard versions of the expansions will also be available as add-ons.\nAfter the campaign ends, we will be using BackerKit as our pledge manager which works like an online store where the amount you pledged is available as credit for you to spend as you wish. This is where you will provide your shipping information and can choose to add any additional products to your pledge.\nThere are 2 ways to pay for additional items. You can add products in the pledge manager after the campaign has ended and pay for the difference at that time, or you can pledge more during the campaign and spend that however you want in the pledge manager. Keep in mind, when you pledge more during the campaign, it helps unlock stretch goals!\n This game will be printed in enough volume to fulfill the Kickstarter plus a small amount to cover damages and other issues. We reserve the right to sell any remaining inventory on our website, at conventions, and 3rd party sites if necessary.\n In 2009, we launched our first game Castle Panic, a cooperative, tower defense board game. Over 10 years and hundreds of thousands of copies later, we're thrilled to bring you the ultimate edition of this evergreen family game.\nThe costs listed above are estimates only but are based on current pricing from our fulfillment partners using an estimated weight.  Actual shipping costs will be charged via our pledge manager.\nDue to complications with customs and regulations, we will not be shipping to Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Afghanistan.\nFireside Games was started in 2007 by Justin and Anne-Marie De Witt. We decided to take our hobby of creating board games to play with our friends and turn it into a business. In 2009, Castle Panic became the first game we published and since then we've grown our catalog and published 18 other games. We founded Fireside Games with the core goal of creating fun, innovative, accessible board games that everyone can enjoy, and based on our growing fanbase, we're proud to say it's working.\nWe are committed to bringing joy and shared experiences to life through board games. We love hearing from people all over the world about how our games help them reconnect with friends and family, even in this hectic world. We\u2019re proud of the experiences we create, and we are thrilled when we can help you to bring fun home!\nCaste Panic Deluxe is a big project and a complex, expensive game. We've been selling games to Friendly Local Game Stores for over a decade, and we've seen the ups and downs of the 3-tier system (publisher, distribution, retail). We're in a challenging time right now, and selling games like this can be difficult to get right. Because this game is so costly to manufacture, there is a lot more risk if we were to publish this game through traditional means. A wrong guess on inventory could be devastating to a company of our size. We know that there are a lot of fans who have loved Castle Panic from the beginning, and we know that there will be new fans that are going to fall in love with this new version. The best way we can get a product of this scale into the hands of players who are excited to have it is to work directly with our customers via the Kickstarter platform.\n                                         This project is promoted by Green Inbox", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFireside Games has been publishing and distributing games around the world for over 10 years. During that time, we have worked with multiple factories and international freight companies to ensure our high-quality games are delivered on-time and in excellent condition. For this Kickstarter, we are working with experienced partners like Quartermaster Logistics to continue that pattern of quality.\n\nWe are estimating an April 2021 delivery date for this game, but please keep in mind this is only an estimate. There are always elements beyond our control when working with manufacturers, such as virus outbreaks, production delays, shipping delays, and delays with customs. Should these occur, we will make sure that we quickly communicate any delay or challenge and keep our backers updated.\n\nIn addition, the game has already gone through substantial production, which further limits chances for delays. The artwork is mostly complete, the plastics have been sculpted, and many components are at or near a print-ready state. Final layout, proofing, and editing still need to be done, but we are confident in our timing estimates.\n\nREFUNDS\nIf you request a refund within 14 days of the end of the campaign, we can refund your pledge including fees. Refunds processed after 14 days will still be credited, minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees, which we are not reimbursed for at that time. Refunds processed after 14 days may be refunded via PayPal or Stripe to the card used at our discretion.\n\nThis project is funded in USD and any refunds will also be processed in USD.\n\nAll artwork and materials shown are not final and are subject to change.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Fireside Games\n2 created \u00b7 14 backed\nFireside Games was founded in 2007 when we decided to take our hobby of creating board games and make it our livelihood.

That game was Dark Tower. We want to bring you that same sense of awe and wonder, pushing the boundaries of what a board game can actually do. After 3 years of painstaking work by a team of two dozen designers, engineers, and artists, we are thrilled to present to you a game with echoes of that long-gone wonder but ultimately unlike any game you've ever experienced.\nReturn to Dark Tower is a game for 1 to 4 heroes who undertake epic quests, fight fearsome foes, and test their mettle against the looming darkness of the titular tower. Now featuring both cooperative and competitive play. Designed by Rob Daviau and Isaac Childres -- designers of the two highest rated games of all time on Board Game Geek -- along with Noah Cohen, Brian Neff, and Justin D. Jacobson, the streamlined rules offer players difficult choices about when to advance their objective, gather resources, deal with threats, or level up.\nEach player controls a unique hero with their own starting inventory and special abilities. Along the way you gain helpful items, powerful virtues, and trusty companions to help you achieve your goal: Find a way into the Tower and defeat a powerful adversary.\nFiguring out the best way to utilize all of these assets is the key to victory. The game actively works to stop you, responding to your decisions and taking advantage of your missteps. Foes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, will stalk your hero and assault your buildings.\nOur innovative combat system leverages the power of the processor. Within the app, select virtual \"cards\" from each foe's unique deck, revealing the potential consequences of the fight. Then, use your hero's advantages to modify those results. Will you mitigate losses across the board, or focus on one to gain valuable resources for your effort.\nLooming over the board, the Tower itself is the greatest menace you'll face. Each turn, you drop a skull in, representing the threat of corruption. You decide where emerging skulls are placed, making those buildings less useful. At times the Tower itself springs to life, releasing trapped skulls in a single wave or revealing glyphs that sap your will.\nThe path to victory is fraught with peril. Battles and events can give your hero corruption. If you don't cleanse skulls from the buildings to keep them in check, the supply quickly dwindles.  \nTarry too long and face the risk of having all of the seals of the Tower break. Corruption, skulls, and time: Any one of these pitfalls can spell defeat.\nReturn to Dark Tower constantly presents new challenges. The adversary within the tower, the plan to access the tower, and the suite of foes you will face can mix and match in thousands of combinations. Play the same array over again or try something completely new.\nFor complete information on how to play, you can download the draft rulebook: \nOr check out this live playthrough we'll be doing on the Dice Tower:\nWe've also arranged for a how-to-play video by Rodney Smith of Watch It Played! at the time of release. \nCreated by a world-class team of designers and engineers led by Tim Burrell-Saward, an expert in technology-augmented games, the Tower itself is a game component without equal. From its very foundation, it's been devised to play an integral role in the game. Using a collection of magical-yet-reliable technologies, it generates game moments that simply wouldn't be possible without it. The Tower literally and figuratively dominates the table, drawing upon all of these powers to foil you. You will grow to curse its name.\nLearn more about the intense tower development and prototyping process in Tim's designer diary.\nThe game itself is rich and satisfying. But we have a few additional items in this campaign to upgrade your play experience even further.\nFor those of you new to Kickstarter, an \"add-on\" is something that's not included with a regular pledge. If you're interested in getting the neoprene board or any other add-on we might add to the campaign, it's really simple. You have two options:\nYou can manually add the amount of the add-on to your existing pledge. (For the mat, it's $45 including shipping.) If you have already backed and you go to the top of the campaign page, you'll see a button in the top right that says \"Manage your pledge\". Click on it and it will take to you a \"Change your pledge\". Then you can click on the \"Change your pledge\" button. Then, in the box with your \"Pledge amount\" you can manually add the cost of the add-on to your pledge. Click \"Continue\" and your good to go. (NOTE: You can also use this method if you want to upgrade from the Charge the Tower to the Azkol's Fortune level.)\nYou can add any add-ons in BackerKit (our pledge manager) after the Kickstarter campaign is over. I'll talk more about how pledge managers work as we get closer to the end of the campaign, but it might help to think of it as an online store where you \"spend\" the money you pledged in the Kickstarter campaign and where you can add new items too, like the neoprene board.\nThe Alliances expansion offers new rules and components to add further depth and variety to the game. It includes two new heroes, who can be used in any game. The Archwright fortifies buildings to protect the kingdoms; the Haunted Recluse dabbles in forbidden lore to powerful effect. Influence is a new resource that can be used to form alliances with powerful guilds or to thwart the capricious whims of the nobles. It also features new treasures and allies with more intricate abilities for experienced gamers.\nThe Dark Horde box contains stunning sculpts by Punga Miniatures of all the foes in the game. These figures bring the foes to life. (Keep checking back here as we unlock new foes and show off new sculpts.)\n The Coffers box replaces the cardboard resource tokens from the game and the Alliances expansion with top-quality, heat-transfer plastic tokens that have a great feel and durability.\n This 50mm diameter and 5mm thick metal coin signifies the active player. If you signed up for notification before the campaign launched, you will receive this for free if you back the kickstarter and get at least one copy of the game.\nSeriously, folks. This mat is huge and heavy. It's about 80% larger area than the game board. This makes the spaces larger as well of course, which can be a boon if you're playing with the miniature foes from Dark Horde. A real specialty item for those who want to play an epic game on an epic stage.\n Check out this rendered example of a gold foil art print:\nGive all your cards a little extra protection. This add on includes enough high-quality sleeves to cover the cards in Return to Dark Tower and the Alliances expansion. 110 standard card sleeves and 85 mini sleeves (plus some extras for lost or broken sleeves). Most sleeves will have a custom print, but some standard sized sleeves will be completely clear to accommodate the double-sided cards.\n\n\n\nPart of the fun of Kickstarter is achieving new heights and unlocking those sweet stretch goals. We've already packed a ton of content into the game, but we'll manage to find a way to get even more goodies in there. So let's break those seals!\n\nAt PAX Unplugged, we were able to run a number of tabletop media folks through the game. These opinions were freely given and provided without compensation. Here's what they had to say:\nWe know you'll love Return to Dark Tower. But you might be wondering why you should back now. There are four main reasons:\n You can get what you want. The game itself is not exclusive to Kickstarter. We do have a retailer pledge in the campaign, so there are stores who will have the game when it fulfills. However, we are still unsure if we will be able to sell the game into retail distribution, and the add-ons are particularly unlikely to be available widely if at all. Backing is the one way to make sure you get what you want.\n You'll get the game early. Even if the game does ultimately go into retail distribution, we promise to hold the retail street date for at least 90 days after fulfillment is completed. As a thank you for backing, we want to make sure our backers get the first chance to play.\n You'll get the game cheaper. As you can see above, you will pledge less than the suggested retail price. While it is true that some online retailers often sell games for below the regular price, that's less likely in this case. If the game ends up not going into retail distribution, aggressive discount merchants won't have access to it. Even if it does, the discount is likely not be much better than what we're offering in the campaign.\n You get to be a backer. Being a backer means being part of a community. You'll get to speak up on decisions we make during the campaign and share ideas with other backers. Most importantly, you'll help make this game become a reality. Some publishers have taken to using Kickstarter as a pre-order system. That is very much not the case with Return to Dark Tower. We simply could not make the game without the success of this campaign. You'll be a part of that success and part of unlocking stretch goals to make the game even better.\nIf this is your first Kickstarter, welcome! It's easier than it looks, and being a part of the community can be a lot of fun! You can download this PDF file to learn the ins-and-outs of being a backer:\n\nWe are once again using Quartermaster Logistics to oversee the fulfillment process. They have an extremely efficient system, quality packaging, tracking information, and their customer service is second to none. We have key fulfillment partners within each shipping region and will freight the games directly to them, so there will be no surprise charges, such as customs fees or VAT, to the US, EU, Canada, Australia, and China.\nPlease use the chart below to calculate your shipping fees. Due to an error in setting up the Kickstarter page, some countries are charged at the time of pledge, while others will be charged in the pledge manager after the campaign. You will also be charged additional shipping if you order add-ons or multiple copies and at similar rates.\n\n\nWe cannot ship to PO Boxes or to the following countries: Afghanistan, Burma (Myanmar), Cuba, Iran, Kazakhstan, North Korea, Russia, Sudan, Syria, and Ukraine.\nWe are also thrilled to be using BackerKit again. They are a \"pledge manager\", a third-party service that lets us manage our orders and fulfillment. This service starts after the Kickstarter campaign is over. You'll be able to add items to your pledge at that time. If you are unsure about what items you want to get during the Kickstarter campaign, you can back at the \"Map to BackerKit\" level. This will qualify you as a backer for any backer-related goodies and will give you access to the pledge manager to fill out your order later.\nRETAILERS\nWe have a special pledge tier for verified brick-and-mortar stores: For Bazaar Proprietors Only. You pledge only $50 during the campaign. In the pledge manager, you will finalize your order. However, you will not have to pay the remaining balance due until the games are ready to ship. Please click here for detailed information and terms.\n\nRestoration Games was founded in 2016 by Justin D. Jacobson and Rob Daviau on a shared love of all those great board games they played when they were kids. We are dedicated to restoring these games to their rightful glory,  bringing the fun we had to a new generation of gamers.\nSPREAD THE WORD\nA Kickstarter campaign is only as strong as its backers. You will help push this project to be the best it can be. We greatly appreciate anything you can do to let people know about this campaign, whether it's posting to your social media accounts, sending emails to your friends, or letting a co-worker know about us.\nIf you haven't joined the game's facebook group, go do it. We've got a great group of fans, talking about the game, and it's a good place to go to ask questions.\nAnother fun way to spread the word is adopting a social media avatar. Tag yourself:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our third Kickstarter, and they just keep getting bigger. So, while we've learned from each one we've done, the challenges keep getting bigger as well. Notably, the tower itself is a complicated component with mechanical and electrical components. Fortunately, we've enlisted Tim Burrell-Saward and Andrew Sung, both with significant experience on these types of projects, to assist us in overseeing the manufacturing process.

And we're finally ready for you all to have an early look. I tapped Tim Burrell-Saward, our project manager and lead engineer, to do a deep dive on the app's heroic journey to date. As with all of these updates, keep in mind that we are still refining and will continue to refine until the game gets into your hands and beyond. Everything here is still \"in progress\".

It's one last check to find any last little problem before we hit the big red button that says: spend a million dollars and make 25,000 copies of this game.\nI have to say, it's an extremely rewarding milestone. This is a project that I've been working on for three years. To open a box and see an actual playable game, is pretty amazing. But it's also a bit tense. It's a major checkpoint, where you're likely to run into issues that need addressing.

With the print materials locked down, we're looking to refine the data in the app to further balance the game and make it more fun. These playtests will be done in Tabletop Simulator (on Steam) and (unlike prior playtests) will use the actual app (with a built-in Tower simulator). We know some of you signed up for and did some playtesting for us last year. But circumstances can change -- especially during current events these days. So, even if you signed up before, if you're still interested in testing, please sign up again.

Early on in our development, we decided to make our restored version cooperative. We think it's more thematic appropriately and mechanically.

Today, we're going to take a quick look at the box bottom.\nFirst thing to mention is that it's not really the box bottom at all. The box will, of course, have a bottom, but this ain't it. Bigger picture, we know that you all have paid a lot of money to get this game. Granted, most of the expense is in that beautiful electronic Tower that will sit in the middle of the table. But we want to make sure the rest of the game meets that high bar. Traditionally, a box bottom serves as a marketing piece to attract the eye of someone browsing at the store, and it also has a number of legal requirements, like safety icons and copyright notices. Fine and necessary, but not pretty to look at. So we made the decision to have the traditional box bottom turn into a separate slip sheet that is placed over the box bottom and held into place by the shrinkwrap. When you open the shrink, you can toss the sheet. This meets our needs for the store shelf, but allows you to have a beautiful game box on your shelf at home."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #45", "update_userinfo": "Guest Update: Checking in on the Tower with Tim Burrell-Saward", "update_content": "I know folks like to get a closer look at the manufacturing process, and there's no one better to fill us in than Tim Burrell-Saward, our project manager and lead engineer.\nBefore we jump in, Board Game Geek's annual \"Most Anticipated\" list is underway.

Car Wars returns in a bigger, faster edition. The detailed 1/64 scale cars move, shoot, and catch fire the way you remember, with faster car creation and play. Once again you can rule the roads!\nNOTE: All miniatures are pre-assembled at the factory and packed unpainted. Miniatures shown in the photos are prototypes. Miniatures painted by Ben Williams. \nForeground: Warhawk, one of the six miniatures included in the Car Wars Sixth Edition core game. Miniatures painted by Ben Williams. Displayed on Car Wars Playmat #1. All work shown is in progress and not final.\nNorth America, A.D. 2070. It's a new American frontier. The collapse of the U.S. government plunged the country back into the good old days -- days of wilderness lawlessness, banditry, regional dictators, and of the men and women who combat them. Modern-day knights and gunslingers are in demand; but the automobile has replaced the horse, and the machine-gun and recoilless rifle have made the sword and Winchester obsolete.\nWelcome to 2070. It's a rough world, but it's the only one around . . . \nCar Wars is the game of autoduelling; futuristic vehicular combat where the right of way goes to the biggest guns. Players design their cars -- complete with weapons, accessories, and crew -- and then take them into the arena where one emerges victorious . . . and the others are annihilated.\nFirst published in 1981, the earlier editions of Car Wars have sold over one million games and accessories during the game's near-four decades of life. Over the years, the Car Wars game -- as well as the world of Autoduel America -- has grown, adding more rules, expansions, and setting information. Car Wars has been featured in comic books, novels, solo adventure gamebooks, and even the fan-favorite classic Autoduel video game. \nNow, with your support, we're bringing Car Wars back as a faster, streamlined edition with detailed plastic models. The new Car Wars game was designed to put you in the driver's seat and into the action within moments of opening the game box.\nAfter six years of design, development, playtesting, and constant refinement and improvement, we've completed the core of the new Car Wars Sixth Edition game and we're now ready for your support. \nThe new core game includes:\n24-page rulebook, covering everything from building your car to movement and combat. All of the rules you need to start playing the game within moments of opening the box! \nTEN (stretch goal unlocked!) 1/64 scale highly-detailed plastic car models. Pre-assembled at the factory, these miniatures are ready to paint and take into the arena. Or, for those of you who want to jump into the action quickly, use the minis unpainted; the included car bases are color-coded so that you can instantly tell which car is yours during the heat of battle. \nFour color-coded player dashboards. These thick, durable chipboard player boards include spaces for your car's external armor, tire points, power plant points, as well as your car's current speed.\nFour car design decks, one for each of the included player colors. Using the Build Point and Crew Point mechanics, you can create a new car (and outfit your driver and gunner) in less than ten minutes! \nTwo different internal damage card decks, one for low-point value games and one for high-point value games. Once armor is penetrated, a card is randomly drawn to determine which internal components are hit by an attack.\nTwenty custom six-sided dice! These are used for all attack rolls, defensive rolls, and movement rolls in the game. \nA chipboard turning key. Use this when moving and maneuvering your car. The turning key works perfectly with the color-coded car bases; your car pivots over the turning key so that every swerve and turn made during the game is as accurate as possible. (Includes two copies of the key.)\nDozens of damage, control, Ace, and other types of tokens that are required to track the status of various parts of the game. \nA streamlined collision system that keeps the game flowing. See how the bases are used to push objects in a collision in this Facebook video. \nPlay on any smooth tabletop . . . or upgrade your game with one of the Car Wars playmats (see Add-Ons, below). The basic arena is a 36\" x 36\" playspace; scenarios expand play to even larger spaces for those of you who want to play a highway game, fight in a big arena, or tackle a custom scenario of your own design.\nDo you want to see Car Wars Sixth Edition in action?

There are a few minor issues, but nothing that we cannot address during the manufacturing process.\n\nOnce the factory opens, we'll officially shift the project into the production stage. There will still be a number of checks (photos and video, so we can confirm that those minor issues are handled). We will not skip steps during this process or sign off on \"meh, that kinda works\" components. We get one chance to do this right, and we are going to do what it takes to make the game (and all of the expansions) the best we can manage. This means that although we are moving into production, we may find an item or two that requires another round of tweaks during manufacturing.\n\nWe know the one question everyone is asking comes down to: When will I get my game? We cannot answer that question until the factory opens and together we can nail down a final production schedule. One of the biggest risks of a Kickstarter campaign -- especially one of this size -- is that everyone gets to see the behind-the-scenes delays and issues that can plague a project. We don't assign a release date for many of our games until everything is at print (and often not until we have the tooling complete). This makes it easier to hit release dates, but even that has been a major challenge over the last year as the global pandemic disrupts everything.\n\nWe'll be back with a new update in early March after the factory opens and we work out a tentative production timeline. Once we have a production schedule, then we can start to plan a shipping schedule, but even that will be subject to the issues that are delaying shipping containers.

But it appears that a mistake was made and material was changed during material changeover in the machines at the factory, affecting some of the games produced. We have already looked into the possibility of reprinting the cards, but this would be a time-consuming process and we would rather address this issue immediately. Because we pride ourselves on making components of the highest quality, we would like to rectify this situation by offering card sleeves.

Our thanks to all the Backers who supported us in this Quest!\n\nUse this link to access the Pledge Manager for Backer Rewards and Late Pledges! \nIf you have any questions or comments please email kickstarter@alderac.com.\nThunderstone designed by Mike Elliott is a deckbuilding game of heroic adventure. We successfully Kickstarted Thunderstone Quest in the spring of 2017 and delivered it in the spring of 2018. This Kickstarter features Barricades Mode designed by Bryan Reese - rules and components for Solo & CoOp play, plus Quest 6: What Lies Beneath. \nYou have four options to back this Kickstarter - Champion which consists of the Champion Reward from the 1st Kickstarter (but no new content), To The Barricades! which consists of just the new content in this campaign, Champion + Barricades! which combines both into one Reward, and Your Inventory is Full! which includes the Champion Reward, To the Barricades, 6 packs of Premium Sleeves, the Epic Thunderstone Add-on for Champion, and the Neoprene Mat.\nNote for Expedited Backers: You can not drop your Expedited Pledge, switch to Your Inventory Is Full! and still get your Champion Expedited. If you have an Expedited Reward, don't change it. In the Pledge Manager there will be a special Add-on option just for you that will allow you to get all the contents of Your Inventory is Full! at the same price as the Reward listed in this Kickstarter, and keep your Expedited Status. We will ensure that every Expedited Backer who wants this Add-on will be able to get it regardless of the quantity ordered by other backers.\n\nIf you drop your Expedited Reward, we can't re-instate it. So don't drop it unless you really, really don't want your Champion Expedited.\n\nNote for All other Backers (including $1 Backers): You will be able to upgrade your Reward in the Pledge Manager to Your Inventory Is Full! at the same price listed in this Kickstarter. QUANTITIES MAY BE LIMITED, so to guarantee that you get this Reward, select it now!\nAll Quests, including Quest 6: What Lies Beneath, and the Stretch Goals from this campaign, can be played in either Barricades Mode or normal Competitive Mode.\nFollow the story of our Stretch Goals through Kickstarter Updates!\nThe Backers of this campaign successfully unlocked all the contents of Quest 7: Frostbite(*)! Quest 7 will join Quest 6: What Lies Beneath in the To The Barricades! portion of the Rewards for this Kickstarter.\nThe Premium To the Barricades Box!\n(This packaging is for illustration purposes only. Actual box will differ in graphics and dimensions.)\nWith the completion of this Kickstarter the Thunderstone Quest product line will be quite large. 7 Quests, support for 6 players, and all the components of Barricades Mode, 8 plastic figures, plus Epic Thunderstone support and the Neoprene Mat.\nPlayers who sleeve their cards will have filled the original Champions box. Therefore the To the Barricades box is being engineered to complement the Champion box.\nIn addition, we\u2019re designing a plastic vac-formed tray that you can use to organize the various tokens and chits as you play. You can store those things in the tray in the box, and when it\u2019s time to play you can remove the tray and put it on the table! The tray will be designed to accommodate all the various tokens & chits included in Champion + Barricades and a little bit of future proofing as well!\nCurrently we envision a box with the same dimensions as the Champion box. The two boxes will be graphically designed to compliment each other on your shelf.\nWe believe that when you sleeve all cards including Epic the two boxes together will have room for one or two additional Quests beyond Quest 7, although the storage of the Neoprene Playmat Add-on will affect how many cards can be stored in the boxes.\nWe expect to provide a suggested setup for managing all the cards and components across the two boxes when To the Barricades is delivered. Some people will prefer to organize their cards alphabetically by type. Others will organize them by Quest. We will have suggested setups for both.\nThe To the Barricades! Box will be Kickstarter Exclusive!\nAll unlocked Stretch Goals are included in To the Barricades! and Champion + Barricades! and Your Inventory Is Full!, but are not included in the Champion reward.\nThe Champion, Champion + Barricades! and Your Inventory is Full! rewards will include all the Kickstarter Exclusive Content from the 1st Kickstarter.\nKickstarter Exclusive content (\"KSE\") are game components and accessories that are available only to backers of AEG Kickstarters. Kickstarter Exclusive Content may be released in an alternate form more widely in the future (different art, different card titles, etc.).\nThunderstone is one of the most successful games AEG has ever published. The Kickstarter for Thunderstone Quest and delivery of those rewards to our backers has enabled us to continue to develop the game and expand its scope. \nThe major innovation for Thunderstone Quest is ... Quests! Each Quest consists of a selection of dungeon tiles and monster cards that create an engaging storyline. Each Quest includes rules for selecting Village and Dungeon cards to create a variety of Adventures. After you've mastered each Quest you use random setups of Quest cards to create new Dungeons and Villages - build your own Quests and Adventures!\nThe Champion Reward\nIncludes:\nReally Big Box that holds all Champion content (even sleeved!)\n5 Quests (each Quest includes approximately 245 cards and 6 Dungeon Tiles [except Ripples in Time which includes 4])\nOver 130 base game cards (starting cards, quest cards, treasure cards, wound cards, key cards, randomizers & dividers)\nWilderness tile\nVillage game board\n6 plastic Champion figures\n140 wood tokens\n5 six-sided dice\nRule book\nQuest book\nKickstarter exclusives & extras including The Yellow Knight card & meeple (googly eyes not included)\nBarricades Mode\nOne of the most requested features from the community was the ability to play the game solo or in a co-operative game. Our team has developed an extension to Thunderstone Quest called Barricades Mode to make that possible.\nIncludes:\n6 Guardian Boards\n[ In ongoing playtesting, Guardian Key cards were removed ]\n20 damage chits\n1 Damage chit bag\n2 Marketplace overlay boards\n8 Prestige Class boards\n30 Prestige tokens\n20 Guardian Dice (D12)\n1 Threat Level wooden token\n5 Barricade tokens\n2 Additional Player Packs (all components required for adding a 5th and 6th player to both Competitive Mode and Barricades Mode)\nQuest 6: What Lies Beneath\nWe area also presenting Quest 6: What Lies Beneath in this campaign. What Lies Beneath is designed to work with Barricades Mode to create a seamless storytelling experience. What Lies Beneath can be played in normal competitive mode too. All of the other Quests will be compatible with Barricades Mode.\nIncludes:\nApproximately 245 cards\n6 Dungeon tiles\nRulebook\nEpic Thunderstone support cards\nFull color storage box (will also hold components from Barricades Mode)\nThunderstone Quest Back to the Dungeon is on Kickstarter so that we can bring all our current backers the content they've asked for quickly, and to create an opportunity for new backers to join the adventure and get access to all the Kickstarter Exclusive content from the first campaign.\nThe Stretch Goals in this campaign will be included in the To The Barricades! reward, and the Champion + Barricades!, and the Your Inventory Is Full! reward, but not the Champion reward.\n\n(*) Quest 7: Frostbite is a working title and is subject to change.\nThe rules for Thunderstone Quest are available for download on the Thunderstone page at alderac.com. \nUpdate 15AUG:  We have produced a special Print & Play package for Barricades Mode that you can download and assemble at home. This is version 2.2 of the Barricades Mode system! If you own Thunderstone Quest, you'll be able to play Barricades Mode with this Print & Play!\nThunderstone Quest is a deckbuilding game where 2-4 players (or 1-6 players in Barricades Mode) compete to see who can score the most victory points when the game ends. In deckbuilding games your objective is to try to assemble the best possible deck to achieve the play strategy you prefer based on the options that are assembled for each game, and the random challenges you'll need to overcome.\nEach player's deck represents a party of stalwart adventurers who will face and defeat the challenges of the Dungeon and will return to the Village to recover and re-equip.\nOn each turn you use your deck to generate a hand of cards, and you take actions based on the cards you drew. Sometimes you'll be in the Village buying new cards and using your resources. Sometimes you'll be in the Dungeon fighting monsters. And sometimes you'll do a little bit of both!\nThis new version of Thunderstone enhances the Dungeon mechanic introduced in classic Thunderstone. In Thunderstone Quest you'll be playing an Adventure which is comprised of a set of Dungeon tiles and a selection of monsters, treasures, and challenges that are themed to that Dungeon. You'll get the sense of a dramatic campaign as you grow stronger and finally confront the Guardian.\nDepending on which cards you buy and which adversaries you defeat you will earn victory points. After the Guardian encounter is over, the player with the most victory points is the winner!\nThe competitive mode is designed for 2 to 4 people to play and it takes about 90 minutes to complete an Adventure. Barricades mode is designed for 1 to 6 people to play and will also take about 90 minutes to complete an Adventure.\nThunderstone Quest uses a lot of the rules from previous versions of Thunderstone but the cards from previous versions are not compatible.\nThe heroes must travel through time and into the arctic waste in search of a legendary artifact of great power. Follow along as their story unfolds with each new Stretch Goal!\nEpic Thunderstone: \nOur 1st Add-On is a special set of over 200 cards that supports Epic-style play of Thunderstone Quest for the Champion and Champion + Barricades! Reward. If you backed the first Kickstarter and are backing this Kickstarter at the To the Barricades! level you can also order this Add-on.\nThe purpose of this Add-On is purely convenience. There is no content in the Epic Add-On that isn't already in the Champion Reward.\nAll new content (including Stretch Goals) in this campaign will be Epic-compatible and will have Epic support automatically included.\nThere are extensive answers about Epic Thunderstone and this Add-On in the FAQ. Please check to see if your question has already been answered before asking in the Comment thread.\nEpic Thunderstone is a popular way to play created by players of Classic Thunderstone. In Epic Thunderstone you build a Village and a Dungeon draw pile using one of each of all your cards instead of playing with a pre-selected tableau. It's a way to see and use more of your card collection. Every game will be different.\nRules for Epic Thunderstone are included in the main rulebook.\nThis Add-On is a pre-built Epic Thunderstone deck ready for play. You won't have to subtract cards from your main play set to play Epic Thunderstone.\nYou'll need a full copy of Thunderstone Quest to play the Epic variant since there are cards, boards, tokens and other resources in the main game that are required to play Epic Thunderstone.\nNeoprene Playmat\nThis is one of the most requested upgrades from the community and we're proud to announce that we'll be able to make Neoprene Playmats available as a part of this Kickstarter!\nWe've also heard the suggestions that the size of the Village board is larger than some groups prefer, and this Playmat also addresses that concern.\nThe Playmat will be sized so that it can fit within the To the Barricades box for this Kickstarter, rolled up. The length will be between 295 and 300 mm. The width is still undetermined; the graphics team will be redesigning the Village layout to accommodate the new size after the Kickstarter but the total will be smaller than the current Village board.\nPremium Sleeves\nOur 2nd Add-On are packs of Premium Sleeves. These Sleeves use the same plastic we used in the Mystic Vale sleeves.\nThe Sleeves are 66x91mm, 0.09mm thick (0.09mm = 90\u00b5 (or \"microns\" = 3.54 \"mils\")) and will fit Thunderstone Quest cards and cards that are the same size as Magic: The Gathering cards.\nWe are providing them in packs of 500 Sleeves for $15 per pack. You can order as many packs as you wish.\nTo sleeve every playable card in the Champion Reward and the Epic Add-On you would need 4 packs (2,000 Sleeves).\nYou will need 1 more pack to sleeve the new content in To the Barricades! and Champion + Barricades!.\nThe Champion box holds all the Champion content, plus the Epic Add-on cards sleeved. You will need to store future Quests (including Quest 6: What Lies Beneath and the stretch goals from this campaign) in their own boxes if you wish to sleeve them.\nAdventurer Catch-Up Kit\nOur third Add-on is a way for people who purchased the Adventurer Reward in the first Kickstarter to get the Quests that they did not purchase in the first campaign. It consists of Quest 3: Risen from the Mire, and Quest 4: At the Foundations of the World. The Quests will be delivered in a plain white tuckbox, not the retail packaging. You must back the campaign at the To The Barricades! pledge level to order this Add-on (all this content is included in the Champion and Champion + Barricades! rewards.)\nWe have configured our logistics system to provide the lowest average cost for all our Backers while working with trusted partners for delivery of your Rewards.\nIf you selected the Champion+Barricades (Expedited US Only) reward you will receive your Champion box in an expedited early shipment soon after the campaign ends. We have 1,000 units of Champion in our warehouse in the US so we will be able to send the Champion part of your Reward on an expedited timeline. We believe we can have them delivered 6 to 8 weeks after the close of the campaign. You will need to log in to your order in the Pledge Manager and provide your delivery information immediately after the campaign ends to ensure you get the fastest possible delivery.\nBecause this inventory is already in the United States the cost, customs issues, and complexity of shipping to non-US addresses prohibit us from delivering the expedited portion of the Reward outside the United States.\nThe cost to ship the Champion Reward for expedited delivery will be borne by AEG. Backers at this level will pay for shipping & handling for the rest of the Reward normally based on weight, and the rest of the Reward will ship at the same time as fulfillment of all other Reward content for this Kickstarter in 2019.\n\nIf you have any questions please email kickstarter@alderac.com.\nWe will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship from the closest distribution center to your delivery address. You will pay for shipping & handling in our Pledge Manager. Links to the Pledge Manager will be sent shortly after the Kickstarter campaign ends. \nShipping costs vary widely based on where you will receive your reward.\nWe will ship your Rewards at our cost to our international distribution centers. Based on your delivery address we will either ship to you from our Depot in the EU, in China, in Australia or from the USA (Canada and the rest of the world).\nThe following chart are estimates for shipping Champion + Barricades! (including Stretch Goals) without Add-Ons. Orders that include Add-Ons will be more expensive. \nWe are currently estimating the weight of Champion + Barricades! at 23lbs/12kg.\nUSA:$23 \nCANADA: $40 \nEUROPE: $27 to Germany. $39 to EU + Norway, Switzerland & Lichtenstein \nLATIN AMERICA: $80 to most countries. \nASIA: $33 to China and Hong Kong. $62 to most other countries. \nOCEANIA: $45 to Australia. $75 to New Zealand. \nRest of World: $80\nThe following chart are estimates for shipping To The Barricades!

That is subject to change due to the advance nature of this campaign but Aetherworks is our currently preferred provider and our estimates for shipping to Australia and New Zealand reflect their cost structure.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs from some specific countries have made it impossible for AEG to ship games to them.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Brazil, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nAlderac Entertainment Group is committed to supporting brick & mortar retail game stores. Our Kick It Here program is designed to let stores participate in the fun and excitement of a Kickstarter campaign. \nTo participate in the Kick It Here program for Thunderstone Quest Back to the Dungeon please email kickstarter@alderac.com with the name of your store, the URL of your store's website, and your store's physical address. We will reply with details about the Kick It Here Promotion.\nParticipating retailers agree not to sell Thunderstone Quest product received through this promotion on the internet.\nKick It Here orders are available to any brick & mortar store anywhere we ship the Kickstarter Rewards to - stores will pay actual Shipping & Handling for delivery just like regular backers.\nAEG would like to thank the following experts who helped make this campaign possible: \nMike Elliott, Original Design & Development of Thunderstone\nMike Elliott, Bryan Reese & Mark Wootton, Design & Development of Thunderstone Quest\nMatt Paquette, Kickstarter Campaign Page graphics\nBenjamin Sheedy, voice work for the main campaign video", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAt the end of the campaign we will cancel and refund any pledge of less than $50.

Nonetheless there are always risks associated with manufacturing and logistics.\n\nThese problems can delay or otherwise impact our ability to meet our commitments to our backers.\n\nThese issues include (but are not limited to):\n\n* Production delays \n* Shipping delays \n* Customs delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is April 2019, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nBefore the Rewards are shipped we offer no questions asked refunds. Once we have shipped your Reward our refund policy will depend on the circumstances and will be at our discretion.\n\nAt your request we can give you a full refund within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that we will subtract Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from Kickstarter after 14 days). Those fees usually equal 8% of the total pledge.\n\nRefunds will be processed through Kickstarter and will be applied to whatever payment method you provided to Kickstarter. In the event that is impossible we will work with you to arrange a refund through other channels.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed. Not responsible for changes in the rate of foreign exchange.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you agree to conduct all public interactions via Kickstarter's communications channels with this project and our team and other backers in a positive manner. Harassment, name-calling, or attempts to inject inappropriate content into the public communications channels for the project will result in the cancellation of your pledge (with a full refund) and your ejection from the campaign. We want the communications channels for this campaign to be a friendly, positive place for our community to gather and discuss the campaign, ask questions, and provide input.\n\nAEG reserves the right to cancel any pledge (with a full refund) at any time, for any reason. If your pledge is cancelled while the campaign is ongoing you agree not to re-pledge either under your original account or under any other account you control. Violations of this policy will be reported to Kickstarter.\n\nMinor cosmetic damage to the box or other packaging can occur during shipping. AEG makes reasonable efforts to ensure that the shipping containers it uses are suitable for the safe delivery of the Rewards. If you believe that your Reward has suffered more than minor cosmetic damage please contact us immediately. Keep all packaging including outer cartons for our inspection. AEG will at its sole discretion determine if the damage constitutes other than minor cosmetic damage and/or was the result of insufficient packaging.\n\nIf we ship to the address that you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is returned to us as undeliverable you will pay the full cost to ship the Reward again to a revised address.\n\nIf we ship the Reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is delivered to that address but you are unable to receive it, or you have moved and are no longer the occupant of that address and cannot otherwise retrieve the package, or if the package is lost or stolen after delivery, and you wish to have the order fulfilled again you will pay the full cost to ship the order to a revised address plus the amount of the original Reward plus Add-Ons and other upgrades on your order.\n\nIn all cases you acknowledge that quantities are limited and AEG may not be able to ship all or part of your order more than once.\n\nIf any part of your order cannot be fulfilled for any reason AEG will provide you with a pro-rated refund for that portion of your order.\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in to our Pledge Manager and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your Reward if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our Pledge Manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

Each gameplay element brings a new life and a new application to these 16th century masterpieces which were created by some of the most iconic and gifted painters in the history of visual art. Graciously opened to the public domain by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, we consider it an honor and a privilege to apply these works of indescribable beauty, mystery, and majesty to the narrative of The Island of El Dorado.\nWe\u2019ve partnered with Ship Naked, a well-known fulfillment company, to deliver the most efficient shipping experience possible. They did an incredible job on our first campaign getting packages to our backers quickly and undamaged. We\u2019ve also subsidized much of the applicable shipping and taxes to keep prices as low as possible for our backers.\nWe\u2019re at the beginning of something great. El Dorado Games came to life in 2017 when Daniel Aronson, Nick Tompkins, and Michael Howard had a dream and over 4500 backers like you made it a reality. Since then, we\u2019ve been working tirelessly on this game, this first expansion, and much, much more to pave the way for a long and exciting future of fun and engaging tabletop games.\nWe want you on this journey with us. The feedback we received before, during, and after the first campaign from our families, friends, and backers is a huge part of what made The Island of El Dorado what it is. We want to hear your ideas, see your islands, and know both the things you love about the game and the areas you think we could improve. Our success or failure is not our own; we\u2019re all in this together and we want you on board!\nThis is a game for every kind of player. We designed this game to be something that would appeal as much to heavy gamers as it would to people who aren\u2019t into the hobby at all. Simple rules and mechanics are combined with complex strategies and just enough luck to level the playing field. The result is an experience that\u2019s exciting for players of any experience or skill level.\nAvailability is Limited. While we intend to pursue retail partnerships in the future, we\u2019re presently using Kickstarter and Ship Naked as our only method of distribution for our games. It was astounding to see copies of our game from the first Kickstarter selling for upwards of $100 on eBay after fulfillment, and we hope that with this second printing everyone who wants to join in the fun has an opportunity to grab a copy of the game and expansion at a price less than what they\u2019d be sold for at retail! This KS Edition will include stretch goals and higher quality finishes than what is possible in retail versions.\nEvery one of you is needed. We were overwhelmingly humbled and excited to see the support we received during the first Kickstarter campaign. As a result, we were able to use the funds we raised to conceive and mass produce one of the most beautiful tabletop games we\u2019d ever seen. This absolutely would not have happened if we hadn\u2019t had the support of so many backers, and that need remains in this new campaign. Every backer who supports us and every dollar we raise helps us to pack this game with the highest quality components and materials that we possibly can. The sky is the limit!\nEl Dorado Games started with three friends just trying to make a game we could play together at game night. With the success of the first Kickstarter and overwhelming positive reviews, our new goal is to bring all the fun and excitement we\u2019ve had to friend groups around the world. We\u2019re thankful for every single one of you and we\u2019re excited you\u2019re on this rollercoaster with us!\nWhen designing The Island of El Dorado, we wanted it to be a game that our wives (who are not gamers) would actually play with us. Every decision was based on creating a great gateway game; one that hardcore gamers can bring to a casual gamer\u2019s house to ease them into a realm of experiences involving more strategy and focus. The mechanics are simple, but the tactical decisions are complex. Casual gamers have enough quick-and-easy fun to keep them engaged and there\u2019s just enough luck to keep a relatively level playing field. It\u2019s the intense strategy game that your grandma can play with you\u2026and win! If you\u2019ve been gaming your whole life or if this is your first time with a game like this, we\u2019ve worked hard to make The Island of El Dorado an experience you\u2019ll love.\nStill, there exists a subset of gamers who prefer their games to be entirely tactical, with little to no luck affecting the strategies they\u2019ve put in place. We want our game to be just as much fun for these players as it is for a first-time gamer, so we\u2019ve designed \u201chardcore mode\u201d, a supplementary set of rules which shifts the dynamic and feel of the game deeper into the realm of forward-thinking, calculated strategy.

Cultists are summoning one of the Elder Ones to consume our world, and it is up to the ragtag group of investigators to face the nightmarish forces and disrupt the ritual long enough to make the Elder One vulnerable. And then kill it dead.\nFind out more about these Optional Buys in the following links: Season 2 Expansion, Black Goat of the Woods, Art Book, Extra Dice, Frost Dice.\nDesigned by Rob Daviau and Eric M. Lang, the game features monster artwork by Adrian Smith and investigator artwork by Karl Kopinski. Investigators come from all walks of life, each bringing a unique skill to the team, as well as two other generic skills.\nArt by Karl Kopinski, sculpts by RN Estudio.\nMadness is always at your side when battling unthinkable monstrosities from other dimensions. In fact, the investigators already start the game with a diagnosed insanity, which will will be triggered by your encounters with the occult. You may be doomed by your mental breakdown, or learn to use it to your advantage. The closer you are to losing your mind completely, the more powerful your skills will become.\nArt by Filipe Pagliuso.\nSummoning the Elder Gods are fanatic cultists, and the hosts of nightmarish monstrosities aiding  them in their cause. Each of these enemies possesses its own special ability and combat strength. They are not controlled by any player, but instead have their behavior triggered by Mythos cards used for each specific episode.\nArt by Adrian Smith. Sculpts by Thierry Masson, Yannick Hennebo, Remy Tremblay, Michael Jenkins, Edgar Skomorowski, and Jose Roig.\nThe Death May Die core box contains smaller boxes that hold the modular elements to create each unique game session. Players choose one of the two available Elder Ones and combine their contents with those of one of the six available Episodes. Each of these boxes contain unique figures, tokens, and cards that are only used when playing with those elements. The Mythos deck used in each game is a combination of cards from the chosen Elder One box and the chosen Episode box. Each Episode not only indicates the map setup using the various tiles in the game, but also new actions the investigators can perform in order to accomplish the tasks required to disrupt that episode's ritual. They each also bring their own Discovery cards for players to explore, and the monsters' behaviors and abilities are tailored to each unique story.\nHastur, known as the King in Yellow, and his disciples brand the world with their terrible Yellow Sign. Those that suffer this doom quickly meet their fate by the hands of death or madness.\nArt by Adrian Smith. Disciple sculpt by Thierry Masson. Hastur sculpt by JAG.\nCthulhu, The Thing That Should Not Be, will bring his sunken kingdom of R'lyeh into our world, plunging the earth into a nightmarish reality.\nArt by Adrian Smith. Cthulhu sculpt by Michael Jenkins. Star Spawn sculpt by Aragorn Marks.\nThe Elder Ones start the game off the board; as they move along the summoning track their growing presence invites chaos and insanity into the world to accompany their grand awakening. Eventually they cross over and the real nightmare begins. If the investigators have managed to disrupt the ritual, the Elder One becomes vulnerable and may (just possibly) be killed for good. If not, the investigators now have to contend with an immortal behemoth hunting them while they try to accomplish their tasks. Either way, killing the Elder One will not be easy, not by a long shot, as each time it's bested it grows more enraged and powerful. In the end, either all investigators will fall or death will come for the Great Old One.\nInvestigators, Cultists, Star Spawn, Cthulhu and Hastur painted by Robert Karlsson. Byakee, Deep One, Ghoul, and Shoggoth painted by Fabrizio Russo. Cthonian, Fire Vampire, and Hunting Horror painted by Angel Giraldez. PLEASE NOTE FIGURES COME UNPAINTED.\nIn their mission to thwart the cultist's plans, investigators engage in more than combat. If they can get some respite, they can discover all sorts of things to potentially help them in their tasks. Discovery cards are unique to each Episode, and present the investigators with challenges or choices that will grant them different resources, companions or negative effects.\nCthulhu: Death May Die core box comes with:\n45 Highly-Detailed Plastic Figures\n17 Terrain Tiles\n30 Plastic Tentacle Tokens\n8 Custom Dice\n5 Counter Bases\n10 Investigator Dashboards\n186 Cards\n120 Tokens\n1 Rulebook\nWIP Rulebook\nPlease be aware that this is a Work In Progress Rulebook. It is not final. Rules may still be tweaked and changed, layout and graphics may still be altered. So, if you see anything in here that isn't the same later, understand that during the Kickstarter the project is still in development and all aspects are subject to improvements.\nUnspeakable Pledge - $100\nBackers with an Unspeakable Pledge will receive a copy of the Cthulhu: Death May Die core box, the Kickstarter Exclusive Investigator Julia, plus all applicable Stretch Goals.\nSculpt by RN Estudio. Painting by Robert Karlsson.\nJulia is an incredibly level-headed investigator. Given the extraordinary circumstances she finds herself in, it's amazing how she can keep her wits about her. Her unique skill allows her to take wounds instead of stress, greatly increasing her chances of success in any given encounter. Though it may cost her life in the end...\nR'lyeh Rising Pledge - $250\nBackers with a R'lyeh Rising Pledge will receive a copy of the Cthulhu: Death May Die core box, the Kickstarter Exclusive R'lyeh Rising expansion, and the Kickstarter Exclusive Investigator Julia, plus all applicable Stretch Goals.\nAs the production of this statue is extremely expensive and time-consuming, delivery of it will be staggered. However, all backers will receive the rest of the base pledge at the same time. \nCheck out THIS UPDATE for for answers to some pressing questions, extra gameplay information, and shipping cost estimates.\nLet's not be coy, the heart and soul of the R'lyeh Rising expansion is its colossal figure of Cthulhu! This cyclopean creation is something never before seen in the world of board gaming. Its base is 44 x 44 cm wide, and it stands 57 cm tall to the tip of its wings. In fact, this thing is so huge that his base becomes the board on which the game is played! This plastic statue was sculpted in terrifying detail and will come pre-assembled, with the exception of the clip-on wings, so it can be proudly displayed for all to see.\nSculpt by Remy Tremblay (Julia figure included for scale).\nR'lyeh Rising is a wholly unique Episode, the epic finale to Death May Die, not only bringing its own set of tokens, Discovery cards, Monster cards, and Mythos cards, but also drastic changes to the game's base rules, as the figures move and act freely upon the behemoth's rocky base.\nPainting by Angel Giraldez (Cultist figures included for scale).\nPLEASE NOTE ALL FIGURES COME UNPAINTED.\nNote that anything marked with this:\nis an exclusive item for Kickstarter backers, with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only.\nThe CMON team dives into a gameplay overview of Death May Die with Episode 1 - Blasphemous Alchemy:\nFind out more about the Season 2 Expansion HERE.\nFind out more about the Black Goat of the Woods HERE. \nFind out more about the Art Book HERE.\nFind out more about the Extra Dice HERE.\nFind out more about the Frost Dice HERE.\nPlease Take Note!\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$20 to most states. $50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \nCANADA: $15-$30 to most cities. \nLATIN AMERICA: $70-$80 to most countries. \nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $35 to most other countries (we can\u2019t predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). Backers in China, please read THIS UPDATE.\nOCEANIA: $20-$45 to Australia. $40 to New Zealand. \nAFRICA: $95 to most countries. \nEUROPE: $20-$30 to most countries. \n \u2022 $35 to Norway, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. \n \u2022 $50 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland. \n \u2022 $70-$80 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia. \nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\nTo learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 32nd Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as: \nProduction delays \nShipping delays \nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is July 2019, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely.

Each project is entirely independent from each other, has completely different development teams, and has no effect on the production flow or development of Cthulhu: Death May Die.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

Most people survive by selling their souls to the megacorps, slaving away for their entire lives to stay safe and fed.  \n\nSome people, though, aren\u2019t willing to sell out. They don\u2019t fit into the mold the corporations have prepared for them. They live in the cracks and margins of society\u2014in the shadows. To survive, they do the things others won\u2019t, performing the grey ops the megacorps need in order to keep up with the competition.  \n\nYou are one of them. You are a shadowrunner. You may make your way by slinging spells, swinging swords, firing bullets, or hacking the Matrix. You have to be a step faster and a hair smarter than everyone else if you want to keep working, and you need to keep your wits about you if you want to stay alive. There are plenty of obstacles out there: corp security officers, ultra-violent gangers, vicious critters, and people who carry two hundred bullets and an equal number of grudges. To stay alive, you trust yourself, you trust your team, and you remember a few simple pieces of advice:  Watch your back. Shoot straight. Conserve ammo. And never, ever cut a deal with a dragon.\n If you want to see the components in more detail, check further down the page and also watch our micro videos! \nCheck this out! \nWe've got some wiz options for you.

It comes with a few necessary caveats, however. Please review the process and the necessary legal mumbo-jumbo: \n\nProcess: You will be required to provide a photo of yourself, as well as a street name, catch phrase and archetype/racial preference. Artists will do their best to incorporate you into our standard style guide for the archetype and race you select, and Catalyst gets the last word on art direction as well as acceptable character names and flavor text. [Sorry, no Runner McRunnerface, and no graphic language\u2026 :) we watch the internet too, you know.]\n\n[Sorry, no Runner McRunnerface, and no graphic language\u2026 :) we watch the internet too, you know.] \n\nLegaleze: In order to make you over into a Shadowrun character, and for this character to become part of the Shadowrun universe, you will need to sign a release form that authorizes us to oversee creative direction and to use the final art and information. This release will also assign the copyright of the work to the Topps Company (the owners of the Shadowrun IP). Topps will own the creative work you are helping us create based on your likeness.  \nSince Catalyst Game Labs is a major supplier to distribution and local gaming stores, we want to make sure you are part of this Kickstarter's equation.  \nWho - For any and all retailers, local gaming stores, convention vendors and more. Must have a valid business license and accounts with reputable distribution channels such as Alliance, GTS, Universal,  Lion Rampant and more. \nWhat - A pledge level to help us gauge interest in exclusive product for retailers that revolve around Shadowrun: Sprawl Ops.\nWhen - After the campaign, we'll have a pledge manager level that will be open exclusively to retailers. This will include product specific to retail only and/or extremely good margins if you order through your regular distribution channels. \nWhy - Because we love our retailers, distributors and local gaming stores.  Without you we are nothing. Thank-you, and please note that we haven't forgot you. \nWe've got a lot coming your way in terms of LIVE Q&A's, LIVE Play-through's and more!

The players lay out the gameboard, the various cards and dice, and randomly select one of the Final Mission cards. Then each player starts by selecting a shadowrunner team\u2014taking the appropriate markers and player mat\u2014and placing three starting shadowrunners in their player area.\nEach player has a number of actions based upon how many shadowrunners they have on their team; all start with three, but you\u2019re able to hire up to four. Beginning with the first player in a turn, each player places one of their shadowrunner markers on a location on the gameboard, immediately resolving the effects there. \nA few location examples:  \nAt the Crime Mall, immediately spend nuyen to purchase equipment and place the card with any of shadowrunners.\nAt Max\u2019s Ironworks, get a cyberware upgrade for that shadowrunner.\nThe Eye of the Needle provides a host of different benefits for what you need to accomplish in a turn.\nGot a wounded shadowrunner? Dante\u2019s Inferno will let them lie low, make contacts, and generate some nuyen.\nOr make your way to Mr. Johnson and select a mission.\nAnd plenty more! Check out the game board! \nPlayers not only need to choose the appropriate location to try to maximize their gains each turn\u2014and act before other players can grab what they\u2019re looking for\u2014but each shadowrunner is a specific type, bringing their own strengths and weaknesses to a given location.\nShadowrun: Sprawl Ops includes the following shadowrunner types:\nStreet Samurai: Weapons master, often more machine than man.\nDecker: Computer hacker extraordinaire; the Matrix is life.\nMage: Slinger of spells and incantations; rare, precious, dangerous.\nRigger: Drones and vehicles; a mind-jockey for any mobile tech.\nFace: Charismatic and silver-tongued; confidence man for any deal. \nPlacing any shadowrunner into the Crime Mall location on the gameboard lets you snag any equipment card available for the list price. But if you place your Face there, you can get it for half price! Or if you want that perfect cyberware upgrade for your Rigger, you must place that shadowrunner in Max\u2019s Ironworks. Or send your Street Samurai to The Eye of the Needle to automatically pass the first Stage of a mission; or the Decker to gain extra Loot; or the Mage to move one of your other shadowrunners. That's just the start of the benefits of having the right runner in the right place.\nOnce all shadowrunners are placed and locations activated, players move into the last portion of every round: running their missions! \nEvery Mission card indicates several stages that need to be completed, via a series of icons corresponding to the shadowrunner types. Players then determine which shadowrunners they wish to send on the mission; they can send one, some, or all their team.  After reviewing their shadowrunners, they select a number of six-sided dice equal to all of their available icons\u2014based upon the shadowrunners, equipment, and upgrade cards\u2014and then roll their dice. \nEach die includes two \u201csuccess\u201d sides and one \u201cinjury\u201d side; the rest of the sides are blank. When rolling the dice, a player has three rolls to clear a Mission stage by matching the correct success icon from their dice with the needed icons on the stage. Additionally, a player can use any two of the same color successes to achieve one success for another color. \nIn all the chaos of fast-talking your way past guards, tossing fireballs, and flashing blades while getting the job done, injuries are bound to happen. A player can wipe out one injury die roll result by using any one success. But if they trade too many successes that way, then they won\u2019t be able to get the successes they need to complete a stage within the three rolls they are allowed. And if they can\u2019t wipe out an injury, those start to stack up, knocking shadowrunners\u2014and their dice\u2014out of the current mission, potentially losing them for a turn. So it\u2019s a fine push-your-luck balance. \nOnce you\u2019ve started a stage of a Mission, you must continue rolling until you\u2019re done. But when a stage is complete, you can decide to pull out\u2014sometimes, the pressure comes too hot, and it's time for duck-and-cover. Or maybe you feel you\u2019ve got this despite the injuries, despite the odds, and you push on through. You might see victory \u2026 or you might get half your team injured or even killed, and you\u2019ll spend the next turn (at least) rebuilding. \nKnowing when to walk away is just as important as when to push. If you manage complete the mission, you\u2019ll get the nuyen payout that will help you bring in better shadowrunners and more gear on future jobs. And of course all of this will lead to the big run of the Final Mission.  Check out one of them, the Rescue a Ritual Sacrifice job against Aztechnology.\nBrutal, right? Not to mention the brinkmanship with the other players. Push too soon, and you might not have the dice to make it through; both of the the six Mage and six Hacker successes are tough nuts to crack. And if you fail, you\u2019re left to rebuild for a turn\u2014time you may not have. But wait too long, and another player will sneak in front of you, and with the right set of runners, equipment, and a little luck, they\u2019ll snag your victory from you! \nThat\u2019s just a quick walk through of Shadowrun: Sprawl Ops. There\u2019s much more to experience and enjoy in this unique combination of worker placement and push-your-luck tactics! \nDownload the Working Rule Book HERE. \nWhen you back this campaign you are also subject to some serious stretch-goal mojo, or as we like to call it, SWAG GOALS!\nWe did the entire list!

But they don\u2019t have to do it alone! Fighting alongside them in this all-new campaign, the Heroes will have the aid of the Mounts, enormous beasts of burden!\nThis is an expansion for Arcadia Quest and/or Arcadia Quest: Inferno and requires either to play.\nThis expansion introduces a major new element to Arcadia Quest as these magnificent Mounts can carry Heroes across the map, pushing back against their foes and using their unique abilities to help their Riders!\nRiding in Style\nWith the introduction of Mounts, a few things are now different for the Heroes in Arcadia. For one, each Guild can choose one beastly friend for a Hero to ride upon. Mount and Rider move along the map together, endure attacks together and Shove enemies out of their way together! <3\nEach Mount has its own unique Natural Ability that can be triggered when its Rider is activated for some wild effects! Mounts can also absorb damage for Heroes, and likewise, when a Rider wants to drink a Healing or Refreshing Potion they can drink it themselves or give it to their Mounts - aw!\nMalkhor and his Jacklols\nYes, now hold that pose for a second!\nLegend holds that Malkhor fell to earth on a chariot of blazing fire. The Eternal Hunter has stalked large prey in the Wilds since time immemorial, and now that the Mounts have found refuge in the city of Arcadia, he's upped his game and encroaches the area. Whether he\u2019s truly a fallen god or merely some visitor from a very distant land, Malkhor\u2019s intentions are clear: Stalk. Hunt. Kill.\n\"Hehehheh hahahaha heee heeeee hahahahaaa!!!\u201d\nThe unnerving and insane laughter heralds the approach of the Jacklols and drive many Arcadians mad. These cunning monsters serve Malkhor with spears and jokes alike!\nMeet the New Heroes: Colette & Gaston\nColette is the elder of the Wildling Twins and, as tradition dictates, has led her brother to Arcadia in pursuit of Malkhor. She\u2019s always loved exotic new lands and loves exotic new weapons even more. Not many would employ a battle-axe as a throwing weapon, nor a flail as a whip to entangle legs and arms. Regardless, the Guilds have much to learn from such an unorthodox warrior and are lucky to have her.\nGaston is the younger of the Wildling Twins: impetuous, fearless, and somewhat lacking in common sense. This is not to say he\u2019s overly foolish, but his sister must restrain his more exuberant excesses from time to time. He rarely considers the odds when charging headlong into battle. That said, he often succeeds where others would not. His lightning reflexes and sharp eyes (and no small number of pain medications) make Gaston a fearsome combatant.\nShiny New Toys In Town!\nWith the arrival of new residents in Arcadia, the market street is bustling with shiny new exotic gear! You'll find not only an assortment of Upgrade cards like Saddles, Stirrups and such for your new riding companions...\n...but also new Upgrades for Heroes in the form of new Weapons, Armor, and Spells!\nA Whole New Campaign!\nArcadia Quest: Riders features a brand-new campaign that tells the story of the Guilds attempting to push Malkhor back from the city. In this campaign, 3 alternative scenarios plug into the previously released Beyond the Grave and Pets expansions, bringing a fun mix of Mounts, Pets and Undead together. There's even a scenario that mixes Riders with the other 2 expansions!\nThe Arcadia Quest: Riders campaign is structured a bit differently than other campaigns. As a flash Kickstarter campaign (running for 5 days only!) all pledges already include Kickstarter exclusives and no Stretch Goals or Optional Buys will be available during the campaign.\nIn order to expedite access to this product, we've broken down the pledges by hub. If you would like to receive this pledge by July 2018, make sure to select one of the First Print pledges. Select the Hub of your area/country. If you don't see your country listed in any of the Pledges, please select the United States Hub. Please note that First Print copies are limited to 1 copy per backer. You will be able to get more copies through the Geekfunder Pledge Manager after the campaign ends, but extra copies will be delivered at a later date. If your country's First Pledges are gone, you can choose to receive the Second Print, which will be delivered at a later date.\nPlease take note that if you choose to back with $1 only you will be able to update your pledge for a full reward on the Geekfunder Pledge Manager, but your pledge will ship at a later date - with the Second Print copies.\nRULES & CAMPAIGN BOOK\nCLICK HERE to check out the Campaign Book for Arcadia Quest: Riders. The Scenarios themselves are omitted in this Web version.\nNote that anything marked with this:\nis an Exclusive item for Kickstarter backers, with remaining stock available at conventions and special promotions only.\nPlease Take Note!\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a single Arcadia Quest: Riders pledge - Inclusive of $5 shipping credit.\nUSA: $5-$10 to most states. $35 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.\nCANADA: $10-$25 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $55 to most countries.\nASIA: $5 to China and Hong Kong. $15-$20 to most other countries (we can\u2019t predict an estimate cost to Malaysia).\nOCEANIA: $10-$25 to Australia. $15 to New Zealand.\nAFRICA: $70 to most countries.\nEUROPE: $10-$25 to most countries.\n\u2022 $30 to Norway, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia.\n\u2022 $30-$40 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland.\n\u2022 $55 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nTo learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 31st Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as: \nProduction delays \nShipping delays \nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date for the First Print Pledges is July 2018, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely. We've successfully delivered Zombicide, Sedition Wars, Guilds of Cadwallon, Zombicide Season 2, Relic Knights, Rivet Wars, Kaosball, Dogs of War, Arcadia Quest, Wrath of Kings, XenoShyft, our Base System, Zombicide Season 3, The World of Smog: On Her Majesty's Service, Rum & Bones, Blood Rage, B-Sieged, Zombicide: Black Plague, The Others, XenoShyft: Dreadmire and Masmorra: Dungeons of Arcadia, Arcadia Quest: Inferno, Rum & Bones: Second Tide, Massive Darkness, The World of Smog: Rise of Moloch, Rising Sun, and wave 1 of Zombicide: Green Horde, with wave 2 shipping.\n\nWe have three ongoing projects currently: A Song of Ice & Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game, HATE, and Zombicide: Invader, which are in production.\n\nPlease refer to our individual project pages if you'd like to check the progress there. Each project is entirely independent from each other, has completely different development teams, and has no effect on the production flow or development of Arcadia quest: Riders.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 65 or more", "title": "First Print - EU Hub", "descp": "EXPANSION AND EXCLUSIVE ITEMS ONLY.

Watch the Man vs Meeple 5min video below to learn all the rules.\nIt is a deceptively deep game. The rules are straight forward, and the choices might seem easy at first. But by mid-game you'll find yourself in a pickle if you don't do some careful planning. Traditionally roll-and-write games have been lighter games, but On Tour is a bit heavier.\nWith any game there is a choice to be made. We could have made this game very small, with a pad of paper and golf pencils. We decided to go the opposite route, with the best graphics and components we could get. I wanted On Tour to bring component quality that matches the gameplay. \nOne of my favorite things about On Tour (this is my favorite thing, it can also be your favorite thing if you want, or you can pick something else), is that you can play with any number of people!\nMano a mano against your spouse.\nBy yourself, to pass the time while you are home sick with Mono.\nWith six people at game night when someone says, \"Did anybody bring a game that plays six?\"\nWith all 35 of your dad's weird relatives at Thanksgiving dinner.\nYou could even try to get a few thousand people together and set a world record. Just make sure you have a map for everyone.\nThe game ships with 4 maps, and 4 dry erase markers. 12 will fit in the box.\nIf you want additional maps and dry erase markers, they are $3 each (as in $3 gets you 1 map and 1 marker). Free shipping. I mean, seriously. We're going to put them in the same box. I don't think we need to charge for that.\nYou can pay in the campaign manager after this Kickstarter is over. (We will email you a link after the campaign.)\nOr just pledge at the $48 pledge level, which is the base game plus 8 extra maps (12 maps and 12 dry erase markers total).\nBig (15.2\" x 9.8\" / 38.5 x 25 cm) tri-panel boards, with tape reinforced folds.\nEach player board in On Tour has unique art, each representing a different genre of music. The \"Rock\" map is shown here. The artwork for the country map was reveled in update #3. And we will reveal the artwork for the \"Hip Hop\" map later in the campaign.\nThen we will hold a vote among the backers to decide what music genre should be represented on the fourth map. Leave your ideas in the comments. Right now it looks like Jazz and Electronica/EDM are leading the way.\nWhat's more fun than dice? 10-sided dice. What's more fun than 10-sided dice? Giant 10-sided dice. These dice are hand fillers. 1 3/8\" across. They are fun to roll, and easy to read from across the table.\nYou can write your number in any state in the region on the card, but if you write your number in the exact state listed, you get to circle that number. Circled states in your route are worth double points at the end of the game. How far out of your way should you go to visit a circled state? Should you write a number where you want to, or is it worth the risk to write it a little farther away so you can circle it?\nClick to view the rulebook pdf\n                  Games are great. New games are great. Learning games from the rules is a pain. We're trying to improve this situation.\nWe used tons of giant pictures because it is easier to look at a picture than reading a thousand words. We took feedback from over 100 people on the rulebook's clarity, and will continue to make improvements based on feedback during this campaign.\nThe On Tour box is specifically designed so that it isn't too big with 4 player boards, but you can expand the game with 8 more player boards (making it a 12 player game) and still fit everything in the box.\nYes. The cards will still fit if you sleeve them.\nRahdo and Jen did a special live \"Run Through\" of On Tour. You can play the game with them.\nPrint this low-ink version of the map.\nThen watch the video above to play the game with them. Over 100 people played along live. Through the magic of tape delay, you can join them now. Rahdo and Jen will roll the dice and flip the cards. You mark your route on the map you printed and see if you can beat their scores.\nThese stretch goals will be applied to all copies of the game at all pledge levels and for all extra player maps purchased (for those goals that apply to the map).\nNEW Stretch Goals Added!\n$45K: Hall of Fame Sheet. Keep a record of the best tours of all-time. Record every winner's band name, player, and score to compare against future games.\n$50K: Companion App. An Android/iPhone app that will flip the cards and roll the dice for you. You will still use the dry erase player board and marker. Handy if you want to play a solo game on an airplane, or on your couch.\n$75K: Full Game App. Play solo games of On Tour in the Android or iOS app. This will be a paid app, but backers will get it for free.\nThis is the last stretch goal. At this point I feel like the physical game is the absolute best it can be, and that adding anything more would only jeopardize the schedule.\nALL STRECH GOALS FUNDED. THANKS EVERYONE.\nPlease note that all these videos show prototype components, not the final quality.\n                      Tom also recorded a full play through, you can watch it here. \n The Dice Tower, Tantrum House, and Man vs Meeple were all paid for their preview videos. I had no say in the content of the video, but it is impossible to say how paying them for their time affected what they chose to say. The purpose of these paid videos is to give you an overview of the game from several points of view so you can make your own decision on whether or not the game is right for you.\nI've talked a lot about components and art. But those are all meaningless if the game isn't interesting and fun. Before we did any of that component stuff, we put On Tour through the wringer to make the game play great.\nJuly - October 2017 From idea to game: The game went through many iterations early. Eventually I got stuck. The game was good, but I knew it wasn't all it could be.\nOct - Nov 2017 From \"ok\" to \"really good\": Waitress Games is a professional game development studio. They took the core game that was working, looked at it with fresh eyes, and then started playtesting new twists and new ideas.\nDec 2017 - Mar 2018 From \"really good\" to \"polished and complete\": I started a whole new round of final refinement, which involved sending the game to people on BoardGameGeek that I'd never met and letting them learn from the rules.\nHere's what some of those final playtesters had to say: \nThe game uses simultaneous turns, which is a great plus in my opinion as there is little downtime when playing multiplayer.\nThe evolution of tactics within one play is really nice. At the beginning, there is a lot of long term planification, mid-game is more about pushing your luck, and end-game shines at damage mitigation based on beforehand planification. Overall, continuous adaptation is needed in order to get the most out of the game.\nOk. So I have just played my first game and jumped straight in playing it solo. How naive I was. No regard for any strategy to this and close toward filling all the boxes in I realized I had blocked any decent route possible and gave up mentally, tipping the table over in self frustration. At least I have learnt how not to play.\nStick the kettle on, reset the map. Let\u2019s take a different approach to this.\nOn Tour has a simple design but very deceptive. It invites you in with many options but without strategy and those number of options dwindling as the game nears the end, you will feel this game wasn\u2019t as simple as first thought. The pace of the game is quick but requires thought and calculation to achieve a tour worth talking about. Without a doubt I will be playing this game again and will be bringing this to show at game nights for my friends. I will have to pre advise them not to underestimate it. \nI realized this game is actually more strategic than I previously imagined, and each game is completely different because the starting numbers and positions are completely different. This would make an incredible one player game. \nI like roll-and-writes and I liked this one too. It's easy to explain, quick to play and I enjoyed the careful planning when placing the numbers each round. The doubles rule works well and can come in handy if they're rolled late in the game to connect routes. The four initial state cards make the game more interesting. \nPlease note this timeline is just an estimate. We have tried to make it conservative but realistic. But these dates are not guaranteed.\nThis is the timeline for US shipments. Expect shipments to other parts of the world to be a few weeks behind this. \nDuring this Kickstarter Campaign I'm going to be sharing a daily podcast. Each episode will be short (< 10 min). Over the course of the month, you'll get to hear the On Tour backstory and topics like: how the game came to be, design problems that we ran into, why I wanted to make a game in the first place, art directions that we followed or didn't follow, and the decisions we made that made On Tour the game that it is today.\nCheck out the podcast here.\nAfter this Kickstarter, we will be selling the game directly from our website. (After the campaign, you can go there via the pre-order button at the top of this page.)\nHowever, the price will be a little higher than it is during this campaign. That is the only fair way to treat those of you who help make this project possible by paying in advance.\nThe game won't be sold via traditional distribution, so if your friendly local game store wants to sell it, they will need to get a case from us (back at the $2 Retailer Pledge level during the campaign, or email help@boardgametables.com after the campaign). We will be happy to work with them.\nShipping charges will be charged in our pledge manager after Kickstarter.\nShipping will be $5 ($20 for the 8 pack of games). The game will be shipped from the USA, so there will be no additional customs or tax charges. \nShipping will be $10 ($30 for the 8 pack of games). You will also be charged sales tax/VAT in the pledge manager after the campaign. Your game will ship to you from within CAN/EU, so you will owe no additional customs or taxes when you receive the game.\nThis campaign has CAN and EU friendly shipping. \nAustralia and New Zealand\nWe have decided to partner with a fulfillment center in Australia to offer Australian friendly shipping. Shipping for 1 game will be $20 in Australia and $30 in New Zealand. I don't have a price on the 8-pack yet.\nNon-EU Europe\nShipping is $15. We won't charge you VAT, but you might have to pay duty when you receive your game. UK is being considered EU for this campaign.\nMexico and South and Central America\nShipped from the US. $45. You are responsible for any duty.\nOther\nShipping to South Korea, Hong Kong, China, Singapore, Malaysia, South Africa, and probably most other counties in Africa and Asia. $38. Will ship from Germany. You are responsible for any duty. 8-pack shipping will be $69.\nWe all have regrets in life. Backing On Tour won't be one of them. If you regret buying the game, we will give you a full refund and pay to have it shipped back to us.\nNo questions asked. Actually, we might ask a question or two, but we will refund regardless of how you answer them.\nChad DeShon is the designer of On Tour. Chad has been playing hobby board games for 14 years since discovering Catan in college. In 2014 he founded BoardGameTables.com. He likes heavy games like Age of Steam, Napoleon's Triumph, and Die Macher, and easier to learn games that have surprising depth like Haggis and Konig von Siam.\nAnca Gavril is the artist and graphic designer for On Tour. She loves playing games that come in white boxes, like T.I.M.E. Stories and Food Chain Magnate or at least with white text, like Pandemic Legacy and Blood Rage. If neither of these conditions is met, she enjoys fighting monsters and looting treasures around Gloomhaven.\nKaty Adams is the head of customer support at BoardGameTables.com and for this project. She likes Castles of Mad King Ludwig, Terra Mystica, Scythe, and worker placement games.\nThis is the first board game we've published, but we have run one other Kickstarter.\nA year and a half ago, we ran a Kickstarter for a gaming table called The Duchess. It raised $2.6 million. It was a very ambitious project. We had significant problems. Many tables were damaged during shipment. We had production problems that caused delays.\nBut we did whatever it took to do right by our backers. We stopped production and reworked the product and packaging. And we shipped replacement parts for everything that was damaged. It cost a ton of money. But all the backers got the tables they ordered. In fact, here are some things that they had to say in response to the most recent Kickstarter update:\n\"I'm very satisfied ... You have been very transparent ... you have earned the trust of many of your backers including myself\" -frotes\n\"likely to do future kickstarters with your company\" -Caleb L\n\"I've never been more satisfied by a creators transparency and ability to resolve issues\" -Nick\n\"seriously, this is a very successful campaign for me. Period.\" -Jerome Cance\nI expect fulfilling this Kickstarter to be much smoother. The game play is already final. The art is 80% done. We are working with Panda Game Manufacturing, a leader in the game printing industry.\nCredits:\nDesigner: Chad DeShon\nArtist: Anca Gavril\nCG Artist: Filip Gavril\nCharacter Artist: Daniel Profiri\nRules Editing: Travis D.

I have been talking to my rep (hi, Joe) for months to make sure everything is lined up and on budget.\n\nI believe we have accounted for enough time to finish the art (4 weeks after the end of the campaign), but if we underestimated that, then it could lead to delays.\n\nPanda provided a range for how long each step will take, and we have based our timeline on the longest estimate in the range they provided. A miscommunication between me and Panda that leads to us having to redo one of the steps of the production process is another possible cause of delay.\n\nProduction-wise, this game isn't that complicated. I have seen sample (non-printed) player maps from Panda, but I haven't seen samples with the tape reenforced seam. I don't anticipate any problems there, but I haven't seen them in person. We will also be working with Panda to make sure we are getting dry erase markers that will last and the best possible dry erase surface on the player maps.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Thank you", "descp": "Pledge here if you want to hang out but aren't ready to go all-in yet.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2018"}], "stat": ["117 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 2 or more", "title": "Retailer Pledge", "descp": "Retailers, pledge here for information about how you can buy cases of On Tour to sell in your brick and mortar store.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}], "stat": ["9 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 24 or more", "title": "The Game (4 player)", "descp": "MSRP: $30\nOn Tour Board Game\nEverything you need to play, including beautiful tri-panel player maps, dice, and dry erase markers for four players.\nAdditional maps and markers to expand to more players available in the pledge manager after the campaign ($3 each).\nShipping charged in pledge manager after the campaign:\nUS: $5, CAN/EU: 10USD, Other: ask.\nVAT for non-US countries charged in pledge manager after campaign.\nYou may purchase additional games, just adjust the dollar amount of your pledge accordingly.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2,002 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 48 or more", "title": "The Game + 8 additional maps & markers", "descp": "MSRP: $60\nOn Tour + 8 additional maps & markers (12 player game)\nEverything you need to play, including beautiful tri-panel player maps, dice, and dry erase markers for twelve players.\nAdditional maps and markers to expand to more players available in the pledge manager after the campaign ($3 each).\nShipping charged in pledge manager after the campaign:\nUS: $5, CAN/EU: 10USD, Other: ask.\nVAT for non-US countries charged in pledge manager after campaign.\nYou may purchase additional games, just adjust the dollar amount of your pledge accordingly.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,068 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 179 or more", "title": "Case of 8 Games", "descp": "MSRP: $240\n8 copies of On Tour shipped to one address.

You become a member of the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defence (BPRD), ready to investigate occult threats that threaten our very existence. You will explore gothic locations, hunt down clues, discover artefacts, fight horrific creatures and face off against terrifying bosses.\nFor more details about the 'Box Full of Evil' click here.\nFor full details of what's included in the Darkness Calls expansion, click here.\n For full details of what's included in the Hellboy in Mexico expansion, click here.\nRESIN MINIATURES\nFor more details on the resin miniatures, please check here.\nDesigned by James M. Hewitt - the brains behind the likes of Blood Bowl 2016, Necromunda: Underhive, and Warhammer Quest: Silver Tower - Hellboy: The Board Game features incredibly detailed, pre-assembled PVC plastic miniatures that capture the unique look and feel of Mike Mignola\u2019s visionary work.    \nMiniatures supplied unpainted.\nHellboy: The Board Game gives you the chance to take control of an iconic member of the BPRD. Choose from Hellboy, Abe Sapien, Liz Sherman and Johann Kraus before equipping your agent with additional items that will help in the mission ahead. Each trinket, charm or weapon costs money though, so you\u2019ll need to spend wisely.    \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nEach of the missions in the core game begins by reading a BPRD Case File. This will set the scene for the investigation ahead and give hints about what threats you may encounter. The contents of each Case File are top secret, so the first time you play you'll have no idea what you're about to face!   \nMiniatures supplied unpainted.\nDuring play, agents must carefully balance the Information Gathered track against the ominous Impending Doom track. Information Gathered represents the clues you uncover about the monster you\u2019re hunting, while the Impending Doom track marks how close humanity is to the brink of destruction.   \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nDo you spend valuable time investigating the scene to find a vital piece of the puzzle that could expose a crucial weakness of your foe, but risk the Impending Doom track reaching its devastating finale? Or do you forget the clues and rush through to a final confrontation before the monster has gathered its strength? No one said being a BPRD Agent would be easy.   \nMiniatures supplied unpainted.\nAhead of the climatic battle, you\u2019ll have to face all manner of creatures that lurk in the shadows, ready to pounce at a moment\u2019s notice. When the chips are down, it\u2019s time to fight back using an intuitive system of custom coloured dice. Each BPRD agent has a range of special abilities they can use to defeat their enemies, or they can team up when things get really tough.   \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nWhat\u2019s more, no two missions will ever play the same thanks to the terrifying Deck of Doom. Each turn players unveil a Deck of Doom card, which could trigger a new onslaught from the arcane horrors hiding in the location, initiate a special event or simply move the Impending Doom track closer to its dramatic end.     \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nNo matter what your decisions are during the course of the mission, each play through will always end in an epic final confrontation with one of Hellboy's most notorious adversaries. The board itself changes to reveal the boss' lair and then all gloves are off for a desperate struggle against the forces of evil.  \nKickstarter exclusive box artwork drawn by Mike Mignola!\nWe currently estimate Hellboy: The Board Game (core game) will contain the following components*:\n10 double sided room tiles (2.5mm thick, a mix of 2x2 and 1x2 with a linen finish)\n4 Agent Cards\n50+ cardboard tokens (damage counters, HQ board markers, target priority counters, furniture, doors, flame markers, etc., 2.5mm thick, with a linen finish)\n13 custom dice\nThree narrative Case File scenarios (tarot card sized, 310GSM, lined finish, each scenario includes between 6-8 cards)\nCard HQ Board (linen finish)\n74 Mini Cards (310 GSM, linen finish, Encounter Cards, Back-Up Agent details, Equipment and Starting Items)\n48 Standard Cards (310GSM, linen finish, Deck of Doom Cards and Enemy Cards)\n18 plastic cubes (Agent action tokens and generic black tokens)\nColoured bases to fit on Agents\nRulebook\n*these are given as a guidance because the game is currently in development. We will keep backers updated with any changes to components\nBPRD ARCHIVES EXPANSION\nAlso included in your pledge is the BPRD Archives expansion. This is an opportunity for you to create your own BPRD Mission Case File. You start by choosing the location \u2013 will it be an abandoned mansion, spooky graveyard, or something more sinister? Then select the foe you want to face in the final confrontation or just leave it to chance, so it's a mystery until the dramatic climax!\nWork in progress Case File cards. Artwork/text subject to approval.\nOnce you\u2019ve created the Case File, it\u2019s time to make the accompanying Deck of Doom. You\u2019ve got complete control to make the game as easy, or as challenging as you want by selecting the Deck of Doom cards and then shuffling them together. These will then be drawn as you're playing through the mission.   \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nFinally choose your Encounter Cards. These will dictate what's inside each room and what monsters you will face. Combine these with your  Enemy Cards to battle against wild creatures, hideous Frog Monsters or Nazi soldiers. The choice is yours!  \nFuture releases and expansions will feature elements that can be combined with the BPRD Archives, so the experience will keep growing and the gameplay will keep changing long after you've finished your first adventure.\n   MINIATURES\nWe've worked extremely hard to capture the style of the Hellboy comics. Each miniature has been approved by Mike Mignola himself and we've taken his feedback on board to make them as stunning as possible.\nPLAY\n\nEach miniature will be made from high quality grey PVC plastic and will be pre-assembled, so they're ready to go straight from the box. As you can see in the image below some of the miniatures are huge and will look amazing during play.  \n The videos below use the prototype components we have been using for playtests. The designs/components used are definitely not final but will give you an idea of how the gameplay works.  \n\nShipping is NOT included in your pledge and will be calculated/charged once the campaign has completed. We recommend waiting until the pledge manager to add the exact amount required. See below regarding import duties and taxes.   \nWe currently estimate that the shipping costs for the pledges will be approximately:\nUK: \u00a39\nUSA: \u00a312\nEurope: \u00a312\nCanada: \u00a314\nAustralia/New Zealand: \u00a325\nRest of World: \u00a325\nAll add-ons outside the core pledges will have their shipping calculated and charged in the Pledge Manager after the campaign has finished.\nPlease note, we are unable to ship to these countries: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nWe are dedicated to our retail partners worldwide therefore we are delighted to offer you a retail pledge for our new Kickstarter.    \nInformation about the Hellboy retailer pledge can be found here.\nHellboy\u2122 \u00a9 Mike Mignola.

Many of the miniatures are already designed and approved by Mike Mignola but some are still in concept stage. Once we have all the miniatures designed, the next part of the process is the tooling and production. We predict that we will begin shipping in February 2019 - however, the exact timing is impossible to predict and there is always the potential for delay with products produced in China. We will of course keep our backers up to date as best we can once the project closes.\n\nTo date, we\u2019ve successfully fulfilled 11 Kickstarter campaigns: Kings of War, DreadBall, LOKA, Mars Attacks: The Miniatures Game, Deadzone, DreadBall Xtreme, Dungeon Saga, Kings of War 2nd Edition, Deadzone: Infestation, The Walking Dead: All Out War and DreadBall Second Edition.\n\nWe currently have four outstanding Kickstarters awaiting completion: the remaining Warpath vehicles are shipping to backers now, wave two of Star Saga: The Eiras Contract is currently going into production and is expected to ship shortly afterwards, TerrainCrate will begin shipping in May/June, and for Kings of War: Vanguard the miniatures are in tooling and resin is already in production ready for later this year.\n\nREFUNDS\n\nUpon request refunds may be given within 30 days of the campaign ending, including fees.

We anticipate that assembly will be finished soon and then games will then be shipped to fulfillment (Quartermaster). Once the games arrive at the fulfillment locations, they will make sure all pledges have the correct faction sleeves. To make up for the delay and since the games will be shipping from the manufacturer to multiple fulfillment locations, we plan to expedite the shipping to the locations that have the longest lead timing so that all of the games will be arriving to you, the backers, at the same time as intended.

But you realize something is missing\u2026 it\u2019s those scratches behind your ears\u2026 those enthusiastic belly rubs\u2026 the sound of a hooman calling you a \u201cgood dog\u201d...\nSo it\u2019s time to brave the apocalypse and search the city for hooman survivors, bring them back to Central Bark, and build a place you can call your forever home!\nGood Dog, Bad Zombie is a cooperative board game, where everyone plays together as a heroic dog pack. Together, you\u2019ll explore a post-apocalyptic city while sniffing out scents, barking at the undead, and herding hoomans to safety.\nSomewhere out there, our hoomans are waiting!\nYour goal in Good Dog, Bad Zombie is to find the scaredy hoomans that are hiding around the crumbling metropolis. To do so, you\u2019ll have to investigate scent tokens in different city locations, such as Squirreltown, the Boneyard, and Worst Place.\nEach scent could reveal a hooman in hiding, or a lurking danger - like a zombie mailman, a barn full of bats, or too much kibble for one pup to handle!\nWhen you do find a hooman, your job isn\u2019t done yet. You\u2019ll need to use your energy cards\u2014and the support of the other dogs in your pack\u2014to lead the hooman to safety. Use cards like \u201cRUFF RUFF BARK GRR-RUFF RUFF!!!\u201d and \u201cHooman in danger! HOOMAN IN DANGER!!\u201d to guide the hooman away from hungry zombies!\nChase the zombies!\nAs you play, new zombies will spawn throughout the city and constantly move toward Central Bark! To keep all your hoomans safe, you\u2019ll need to fend off the zombies. Chase them far enough, and they\u2019ll tumble over the cliffs or be swept away in the river.\nZombies can\u2019t resist the smell of freshly rescued hoomans!\nRescue all the hoomans!\nFind and rescue 6 hoomans, and Central Bark will become your new forever home. Everyone wins!\nSix hoomans safe in central bark.\nBut every time a hooman is lost to the horde or a zombie slips into Central Bark, your pack becomes more feral.\nWe must strive to remember the kindness of hoomans!\nIf the feral track reaches 10, your pack reverts to the ways of their wolf ancestors and forgets what it means to feel the love of a hooman. Everyone loses!\nBe a dog!\nWe wanted to infuse our game with as much dogginess as possible. Be prepared to say things such as, \u201cI\u2019m going to lick myself!\u201d and \u201cI howl at you!\u201d\nYou\u2019ll help your fellow dogs by licking and howling, boosting their energy to help them outwit the zombies! Herd and bark at each other to escape dangerous situations and reach defenseless hoomans faster.\nIn Good Dog, Bad Zombie, there\u2019s no room for the lone wolf. Each dog will support the pack with their own unique skills!\nLupin\u2019s \u201cSnuggle\u201d ability unleashes an energizing flurry of licking!\nGood Dog, Bad Zombie is for 1 - 5 players, and takes 45 - 60 minutes to play. Choose your preferred difficulty setting when the game begins - take it easy with the \"Walk in the Park,\" or fend off a massive zombie onslaught with the \"Hounds of the Barkalypse\" setup.

Community Printers is a worker-owned cooperative, like Make Big Things, meaning that everyone who works there democratically owns and runs the business.

We know some people may want to wait to pledge until closer to the end of the campaign for financial reasons. Your payment method will not be charged until the campaign is completed on April 12th, no matter when you choose to pledge. Pledging early is also a big help in creating momentum for the campaign!\nCan I still pledge if you\u2019ve already reached your goal? Absolutely!

Players control a group of Survivors trying to defend their remote mining outpost from a swarm of infected aliens controlled by the game itself. The more experience and power the Survivors earn, the more Xenos invade the facility!\nThis sci-fi interpretation of Zombicide is as sleek as ever, playing fast and furious. The rules have been optimized to reduce setup time and make the game flow quickly, focusing the action on the struggle between the Survivors and the Xenos.\nFind out more about these Optional Buys in the following links: Dark Side / Promo Xenos / Plague Survivor Pack / Orphans Survivor Pack / Kabuki Survivor Pack / Tiles Set / Plastic Token Pack / 3D Plastic Doors / Deck Holders Set / Counter Base Set.\nThe game's character artwork was created by renowned artist Adrian Smith, and brought to life as miniatures by the talented team at BigChild Creatives.\nThe Survivors in the PK-L7 outpost came from all walks of life to aid in the Xenium mining operations, and are divided into two types: Civilians are incredibly resourceful, being able to find useful gear in any room of the facility, on the downside they tend to not be very well protected. Soldiers, on the other hand, usually wear heavy combat armor which give them an edge against the invaders. However, their military training means they'll only find gear in specific Security rooms.\nExplore the Survivors more in depth in THIS UPDATE.\nMiniatures painted by Ruben Martinez, David Arroba, and Rodrigo Cipres. NOTE THAT MINIATURES COME UNPAINTED. CLICK THE IMAGE TO SEE A HIGH RES ALBUM\nWith some luck, Survivors may be able to use some advanced machines to aid their struggle. If you can find the right remote (or are a tech wiz) you'll be able to control the Falchion Sentry Gun to mow down Xenos, or maneuver the Peacekeeper Bot in coordinated attacks.\nIf they manage to last long enough, Survivors can become formidable fighting machines. The more Xenos they kill, the more experience they get, allowing them to unlock new skills as the game progresses. The equipment they find is arranged in their plastic dashboard, with slots for Hand weapons, armor and other gear that can be carried on the body, and a Backpack to store those things you may not need right now.\nSurvivor plastic dashboard.\nPrototype weapons are amazing silent killing machines, but they require an attached Energy Cell to use.\nSurvivors will need all the help they can get to face the Xeno invasion. These mindless creatures come in several different types. Workers are numerous, but manageable. Hunters are deadly fast predators you need to be always on the lookout for. Tanks can take a beating, and dole out an even worse beating. Keep your distance!\nThe different types of Xenos.\nXeno Worker figures 3D renders.\nXeno Hunter and Tank figures 3D renders.\nCertainly the worst of the Xenos is the hulking Spoiler Abomination! This nightmare can only be put down by concentrating your fire, or literally disintegrating it with Hellfire! Don't be fooled by its size, this thing can run you down when you least expect it. While its spawn cards give it extra activations, it will also leap forward if you ever run out of miniatures. The other Xenos may be threatening, but, make no mistake, this is the last thing you'll see before you die.\nSpoiler Abomination figure 3D render.\nIf that wasn't bad enough, the Spoiler Abomination also fills any room it moves into with a terrible alien substance we call Mold. This thing eats through doors and walls, completely destroying the room and changing the layout of the map. This Mold may spawn even more Xenos, but worse yet, if it spreads too far, the base will be irrevocably lost (and so will you). Burn it down before it's too late.\nExplore the Xenos more in depth in THIS UPDATE.\nUse a flamethrower to burn that Mold to a crisp before it can consume the base!\nThe base at PK-L7 is all you have. Walking out into the planet's surface may be necessary at times, but it's a dangerous endeavor. You'll need to get an Oxygen tank in the Supply room if you want to walk out the airlock. And you better arm yourself with a melee or energy weapon, since the outside atmosphere keeps bullet weapons or flamethrowers from working.\nThe tiles feature several different Zone types, like Exterior, Oxygen Supply Room, Airlock, Security, and Corridor.\nZombicide: Invader comes with:\n9 Double-sided Game Tiles \n72 Miniatures \n6 Survivor Plastic Dashboards, Color Bases, and ID Cards \n48 Plastic Trackers \n6 Dice \n125 Mini Cards \n15 Mold Cards \n50 Tokens \n1 Rulebook\nWIP Rulebook\nPlease be aware that this is a Work In Progress Rulebook. It is not final. Rules may still be tweaked and changed, layout and graphics may still be altered. So, if you see anything in here that isn't the same later, understand that during the Kickstarter the project is still in development and all aspects are subject to improvements.\nThe journey into the unknown doesn't end here!\nThe Zombicide: Black Ops expansion raises the intensity to new heights while bringing new challenges for an elite group of Survivors! The Soldiers of Black Squad can be added to your roster, allowing you to play the game with up to 12 players at the same time!\nThese battle-hardened soldiers have been called in to deal with the situation on PK-L7, and find a base already being consumed by the Mold. The 10 new Missions utilize 3 new tiles containing zones already filled with Mold. That means extra Xeno spawning, and a more imminent threat of the base being lost for good. These Mold zones also feature glowing pods of an altered form of Xenium, which may be fired at causing a Hellfire explosion! As dangerous as that sounds, it may be used for our advantage, if we're careful.\nThe Black Ops tiles feature explosive Xenium Pod Zones.\nThis dilapidated base is also under threat of a new type of Abomination we call the Juggernaut. This thing is as ugly as it is unstoppable. Upgrading your weapon won't work, concentrating your fire won't work. I guess we'll just need to lure it into one of those sensitive Pod zones.\nBlack Squad brings some of its own elite equipment to the mission, including the hard-hitting XN35 \"Crawley\" Bot, the devastating Meteor Sentry Gun (a rail gun that can hit multiple zones), and an arsenal of powerful Starting Equipment and other gear.\nExtra arsenal for the Black Ops.\nExplore Black Ops more in depth in THIS UPDATE.\nZombicide: Black Ops comes with:\n3 Double-sided Game Tiles \n9 Miniatures \n6 Survivor Plastic Dashboards, Color Bases, and ID Cards \n48 Plastic Trackers \n29 Mini Cards\n10 Mold Cards\n39 Tokens\n1 Rulebook \nMiniatures painted by Ruben Martinez, David Arroba, and Rodrigo Cipres.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$20 to most states. $50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.\nCANADA: $15-$30 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $70-$80 to most countries.\nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $35 to most other countries (we can\u2019t predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). Backers in China and Thailand, please read THIS UPDATE.\nOCEANIA: $20-$45 to Australia. $40 to New Zealand.\nAFRICA: $95 to most countries.\nEUROPE: $20-$30 to most countries. \n\u2022 $35 to Norway, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. \n\u2022 $50 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland. \n\u2022 $70-$80 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\nTo learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 30th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as: \nProduction delays \nShipping delays \nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is May 2019, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely.

Each project is entirely independent from each other, has completely different development teams, and has no effect on the production flow or development of Zombicide: Invader.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

The reason this is is that the reward promos are donated by publishers and they only have the ability to provide a certain number of them to us - roughly 1500. We cant exceed those limits. So we have those limits imposed on all the levels that receive promos.

The number one request, by far, was Fireball Island. After more than a year of hard work, we are thrilled to announce: Fireball Island is back!\nIf this is your first time checking out the campaign, good to see you! You'll be thrilled to know that our amazing backers have already unlocked tons of stretch goals (and more still to come). As you check out the page, keep in mind that your pledge will also include all of this amazing stuff.\nOn the other hand, if you know you want it all and you want it now, we've got you covered.\nSo what are you waiting for? Come on and join the fun!\nFireball Island: The Curse of Vul-Kar improves on the art, components, and game play of the original. If you loved the game as a child, you'll see we turned that \"delightful chaos\" up to the max. If you never played it before, you'll appreciate it as a fun, exciting game for kids, families, and gamers alike.\nWe found a way to make the new island bigger, taller, faster, and cooler -- all while fitting in a smaller box.\nTom Vasel and the Dice Tower crew sat down with Justin Jacobson, the president of Restoration Games for a full, live playthrough of the base game, which should give you a good idea of how the game plays.\nSometimes, you may face Vul-Kar the way you want...\n... but even then you can't be sure which way it will come out.\nEven as the marble careens down the mountain, the paths and trees can divert it one way or another.\nA tree might even save your life.\nWhile the fireballs are unpredictable, we made sure that players have more control over their actions and more meaningful choices.\nOn your turn, play one of your two action cards to move your pawn and perform a special action.\nGrab a snapshot from each part of the island and get back to the helipad.\nEarn points for collecting sets of treasure.\nIf you get knocked down, you'll lose a treasure but gain a useful souvenir.\nIf you draw a Cataclysm, Vul-Kar gets to take a turn.\nIn all, the game remains fast, fun, and light, but offers meaningful choices.\nWe've also made arrangements with Rodney Smith of Watch It Played! to do a rules video at the time of release. \nNOTE: The board in the images above is a hand-painted prototype and does not reflect final art for the island. Here is the near-final art for the island and some renders showing off the detail that will show up on the finished board.\nBlades of grass and cracked stones ease your path.\nA lonely crab woos visitors at Skeleton Head Beach.\nThere are four expansions available in this campaign, and they are fully interchangeable with the base game and each other. We've also added some amazing new components, through hitting stretch goals, with no additional charge to backers.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                       The view from the poop deck.\nHope you got that snapshot, Saul.\n                                                                                                                                                                                        If this is your first Kickstarter, welcome! It's easy to get involved, and being a part of the community can be a lot of fun. All you have to do is:\nClick on the pledge level you want to back.\nEnter your email address and \u201cContinue as guest\u201d.\nEnter your payment information.\nClick the big green \u201cPledge\u201d button \nTo keep things simple, there are only two tiers for regular backers.\n(You can order additional copies or optional buys by increasing your pledge amount. See Shipping and Fulfillment below for more details.)\nFor verified brick-and-mortar stores: We also have a special pledge level that is just for you. You pledge only $20 during the campaign. When we are ready to ship the games, after the campaign closes, you will use our pledge manager to finalize your order and pay the remaining balance due. If you have any question about your status, please message us, and we will confirm before pledging. All the terms and other information about this pledge level can be found in this special update.\nWe've blown through dozens of stretch goals, like a fireball through a rickety bridge, and unlocked tons of great additional content. Backers get the Treasure Trove expansion pack for free, and it's already full of new souvenirs, injury cards, and more.\nUnlocked sleeves (optional buy, manually add $15 to your pledge).\nPainted minis (optional buy, manually add $10 to your pledge).\nMaker Kit (optional buy, manually add $40 to your pledge)\nNot much time left to hit those stretch goals!\nGiven the unique design of the game, we only have one prototype and couldn't send out review copies. We wanted a fun way to let a bunch of people play the game, so we took the show on the road! J.R. Honeycutt, our Tinker-in-Chief, set off on a 30-day, 13-state road trip, including a stop in Canada! We met up with some of the most amazing game stores, cafes, conventions, and content creators to bring you a chance to play the game in person. And, of course, we got to meet our amazing fans and backers. It was truly a special happening. Below are some videos from the trip. (Note: These videos are of the hand-painted prototype board; the final version of the board will have printed art and won't be as shiny.)\nOne of our backers, MAJBrown22 was able to make it to the Secret Cabal Meetup at Beermongers and wrote up his impressions in this Board Game Geek forum post. \nChris has apparently been ensorcelled by Vul-Kar.\n Check out some epic skill shots in this supercut:\nPLAY\n\nWe are using key fulfillment partners within each shipping region. There are no additional customs fees, VAT, or similar charges.\nThere is only one shipping charge per region regardless of what reward you get -- we're subsidizing the rest.\nFor the US, Canada, and the EU, we are proud to partner with Quartermaster Logistics, the premier provider of Kickstarter fulfillment in the gaming industry. Your games will be safely packed by their professional team, and you\u2019ll be emailed a tracking number when your package ships. For Australian backers, we'll be using Aetherworks, who we used on our Stop Thief! campaign and who did a great job.\nIf you would like to order a second copy, just increase your pledge amount by the cost of that pledge. You do not need to add anything for additional shipping. If you want more than two copies, add the shipping charge for each additional set of one or two. For example, if you wanted to get three copies of the base game sent to Canada, you would pledge a total of $220.\nWe are using BackerKit, a third-party service that lets us manage ordering and shipping. This service starts after the Kickstarter campaign is over. You'll have the chance add items to your pledge at that time. Importantly, though, there will be no additional fees due after the campaign. When you pledge, it will automatically calculate and add all shipping charges. The only additional charge is if you decide to get more stuff. Both pledge levels will be available in BackerKit. You can back the campaign now at any amount and choose your pledge later, or you can back at the Feel the Burn level and upgrade to the Full Vul-Kar.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Due to the limitations of our license, we are only able to offer the game in English and in the US, Canada, EU, and Australia. Please see the FAQ for more information.\nAs we head into the final hours of this campaign, every point of contact and bit of buzz can help. Send the message out far and wide on social media. Use these social media avatars to show your love for the game. And, remember, sometimes the best way is a direct, personal email to that one person you just know will get a kick out of it. Every little bit helps.\nRestoration Games was founded by Justin D. Jacobson and Rob Daviau on a shared love of all those great board games they played when they were kids. We knew there were a lot of great treasures hidden beneath the sands of time. When we announced our plans, the response was overwhelming. We are dedicated to restoring these games to their rightful glory, bringing the fun to those with fond memories, and publishing great games for demanding gamers.\nWe must acknowledge the rest of the team who put in an unblelievable effort to make this a reality. Jason Taylor is our Visual Restoration Wizard, who is the reason everything we do looks so good. Lindsay Daviau is our Production Superhero, who ensures the finished products look amazing. JR Honeycutt is our Tinker-in-Chief; he helps get a game from the idea to a finished design. Suzanne Sheldon, our Master-of-Fireworks, makes sure everyone knows what we're up to.\nWe had lots of talented help with the art and design of the game. George Doutsiopoulos did the fantastic cover illustrations for the base game and the three main expansions. Card art is by Victor Perez Corbella. David Kegg did the retro art that appears in various places in the game, branding, and this campaign. Jean-Louis Sirois helped with some extra foliage illustration you see on this page and on the gameboard. Additional thanks to Matijos Gebreselassie and Bill Tiller for early concept illustrations. 3D sculpting for the miniatures and island features is by Chad Hoverter. Noah Adelman of Game Trayz, LLC did the initial design work on the island trays. Design Innovation, Inc. finalized the island trays. The video work was done by Josh McDowell, and the voiceover was performed by Graham Rowat. Rulebook editing was done by the Meeple Lady. Our thanks to all of them for their unbelievable effort in bringing this project to fruition.\nAnd, of course, we would be remiss not to mention the original masterminds behind the game, Bruce Lund and Chuck Kennedy.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our second Kickstarter and fourth game overall.

We've taken all of those lessons to heart in producing Spider Springs, and I think this is going to be a must-have expansion for die-hard FI fans.

But we\u2019re also announcing the next Expansion for Fireball Island: Spider Springs!\nThis new expansion is another island tray, like Crimson Cutlass, but it actually slots into the main island in one of the gaps between the side trays. You still get to it through the caves, but now it interacts with the main island. Specifically, a broken bridge connects them, with an ember marble on it.

The goats destroyed that Troll, and ever since that time shepherds have weaponized their herds to become weaponized monster goats called Gruffs! Gruff is a tactical combat card game where players duel to the death with custom teams of Mutated Monster Goats! Gruff features unique positional and timing mechanics that create a constant state of attack and counter-play.\nStuff of Nightmares is a stand-alone game that is fully compatible with the Gruff rules system and other Gruff games. Stuff of Nightmares provides the same visceral competitive experience as Gruff, but adds a new faction to the game, plushy nightmare goats called The Stuffkin! \n A Brutally Competitive Game- Stuff of Nightmares' combat mechanics create a constant state of counter-play. When an enemy attacks, you have your entire turn to dodge out of the way, mount your defenses, and launch a counterattack before the attack connects!  \nA Challenging Single Player Game- In Stuff of Nightmares you will be able to battle solo against the trolls that we unlock as stretch-goals in the campaign. Each troll is a distinct challenge ranging from fairly simple to extremely challenging! \nAn Awesome Co-Op Game- Players can collaborate with each other to take down the trolls that we unlock during the campaign!  Play cards to support your teammate on their turn so that you both can taste the sweetness of victory together!\nA Fantastic Multiplayer Game- Stuff of Nightmares can support a four-player tournament out of a single box! It also allows for three- and four-player free-for-all matches and a two-vs.-two mode!\n Stuff of Nightmares is a stand-alone addition to the Gruff line of games. The Gruff series has been honored with several awards, including these!\nThe Gruff series has received a lot of praise from the board game media!\n All stretch-goals will be included in the box of the game, so any reward that gives a copy of Gruff: Stuff of Nightmares will include all stretch goals. \n  You can get an extra physical copy of Gruff: Stuff of Nightmares, Rage of the Trolls, Clash of the Battle Goats, Gruff, or the Stuffkin play-mat by adding the amount listed per item to your pledge.

Buy magic items and gems from the Heroes. Smash them into raw materials! Use those materials to craft powerful Artifacts to sell to the dungeon's inhabitants. \nGet 'em Coming and Going. Spend your gold buying loot from the Heroes, then get your gold back by selling them potions and other useless crap.  \nScam to your Advantage. Use Scam cards like Bait and Switch and Sleight of Hand to manipulate the market and get an edge over your opponents.\nMake your Mark.

The Kickbacks Expansion will not be included in the retail version of the game. This $10 Expansion is free to all Kickstarter backers.\n This card entitles you to make the first move in any game of Heroes Welcome that you play.  \nOverview of a Turn\nOn your turn, you choose ONE of the following actions:\n> Run a Shop: Move the Heroes to an adjacent open shop. Run a shift at that shop, which will allow you to buy and sell from the Heroes. When you're done, put a \"closed\" sign on the shop. It can't be used by any other player this round. \n> Visit a Guild: Pick an open Guild and use its action. Guilds are special locations that the Heroes don't visit. Each one provides a special game action, like increasing your crafting skills, or adding a new shop to the city. Like shops, each guild can only be used by one player each round.   \n> Craft for a Monster:  Head over to the workshop to smash your loot into raw materials and craft an artifact for an eager customer. As soon as you're done, the monster will head back to the dungeon to fight the Heroes. This is where the real money is! \n> Call for Round End: Send the Heroes back to the dungeon to get more loot.

Players must decide if they should save tools for an epic late game point swing or grab points now to take an early lead. \nAI Variants: Experience the excitement of Fire in the Library on your own with the solo game or spice up a multi-player match by adding new challengers.\nHistory is burning\u2014take chances, be brave, SAVE BOOKS!\n See the rest of Gameosity's review here. \nYou can see Jeremy's full review here. \n Below is the How to Play video: \n Below is a full playthrough video: \n Below is the How to Play for the solo version: \nEach round of Fire in the Library begins with each player obtaining a turn order card. Turn order cards contain safe and risky spaces for different strategies.\nPlay then moves to the Saving Books phase where each player, in turn order, draws tokens from a bag to see what they save. If you stop, you\u2019ll score points for any books you save and earn points for bravery if you stopped on a risky space. Books will increase in value as Sections of the Library burn down. \nWatch out! Pressing your luck while Saving Books may pull out fire tokens. Pull two fire tokens out\u2014or just one in a risky space\u2014and things will all go up in flames as the fire spreads! Sections of the Library will collapse based on the tokens you pulled during the Saving Books phase if you've pressed your luck too far. This can cause more Fire tokens to be added to the bag, as well as increasing the value of the burned Sections. \nFortunately, not everything is left up to luck. As a resourceful librarian, you have tools at your disposal. You start with two and may gain more during the course of the game. All of the tools provide new options for saving  books, changing the odds, or giving more opportunities to press your luck.\n Once each player has taken a turn, the Round is over and the fire continues to grow.

The most important reason not to wait with Fire in the Library is that we currently have no plans to put this game into distribution. If you wait, you may end up missing out as we won\u2019t have many extra copies to sell and unless your local store backs the campaign, they won\u2019t be carrying it either.  \nKickstarter Limited \u2013 Fire in the Library might be very hard to find after the campaign, outside of select conventions.\nHelp Us Improve Fire in the Library \u2013 We have a ton of stretch goals planned to help improve the quality of the components and add more content to the game for everyone! \nSubsidized Shipping \u2013  $5 shipping to the USA,  $10 to the EU and Canada and $15 to everyone else. We\u2019re going to pay for the rest of the shipping costs. \nDiscounted \u2013 After the campaign, we will sell the extra copies at a higher cost. \nEU Friendly \u2013 copies will be sent from inside the EU to avoid VAT fees for backers. \nMost importantly, without you, Fire in the Library would not get created. We definitely appreciate every backer\u2019s support in making our dream a reality.\nWe would love to support game stores by offering the Kickstarter versions of Fire in the Library to retailers during the campaign. Back the project for $1, send us a message, and we'll get back to you!

We intend to personally be shipping out the copies that have destinations within the United States. \n To order a second copy of Fire in the Library, add an additional $24 to your pledge with no additional shipping cost. \nI am happy to discuss group orders larger than two copies, but these need to be handled on a country by country basis. Please send me a direct message including country and number of copies to discuss.\nFire in the Library is the third project of Weird Giraffe Games. Super Hack Override was our first project and it was delivered a month early to backers in March 2017.

We were lucky to have the backing of over 6,000 awesome fans worldwide.  We released the retail edition in late 2017 and then something unexpected happened.  It sold out instantly and started going for ridiculous prices on the secondary market.   Then our backers started raving about the game online.  Tom Vasel of the Dice Tower named it one of his top 5 games of 2017 and we were awarded with 4 Golden Geek nominations including strategy game of the year, thematic game of the year, best artwork and presentation and overall game of the year.  It's been a wild ride for Dino Island since it was first unleashed on the world just a few months ago.\nDinosaur Island has been sold out since about the moment it went on sale and we've heard the constant calls to make the Kickstarter exclusives from the last campaign available again.  And we've been listening.\nDinosaur Island is a hot new game from designers Jonathan Gilmour (Dead of Winter) and Brian Lewis; from Pandasaurus Games with amazing, technicolor, ridiculously 90s artwork from Kwanchai Moriya and Peter Wocken.  \n1-4 Players; 60-150 minutes (scalable length regardless of player count), ages 10+  \nIn Dinosaur Island, players will have to collect DNA, research the DNA sequences of extinct dinosaur species and then combine the ancient DNA in the correct sequence to bring these prehistoric creatures back to life. Dino cooking! All players will compete to build the most thrilling park each season, and then work to attract (and keep alive!) the most guests each season that the park opens. Do you go big and create a pack of Velociraptors? They'll definitely excite potential guests... but you better make a large enough enclosure for them. And maybe hire some (read: a lot of) security. Or they WILL break out and start eating your guests\u2014and we all know how that ends. You could play it safe and grow a bunch of herbivores... but then you aren't going to have the most exciting park in the world (sad face). So maybe buy a roller coaster or two to try and attract guests to your park the good old fashioned way?   \nThe X-treme editions are a chance for us at Team Pandasaurus to add some really fun stuff to Dinosaur Island that we can't afford to include at retail.\nFor the base game, that means bringing back almost all of the stretch goals from Dinosaur Island 1.0.  The Dino Meeples, new slimmer metal coins, researcher Beaker Meeples and all of the Kickstarter exclusive plot twists (Purple Die, VIP Meeples, Extra Hooligans) that weren't able to include in the retail edition of the game for cost reasons.  Oh, and a brand new slap-bracelet first player marker that is exclusive to the X-Treme edition.  And of course, spot UV and metallic ink on the box lid!\nAnd for backers of Dino Island 1.0?  As a thank you, any backers who jump into this new campaign for either Duelosaur or Totally Liquid will get the new slap-bracelet as a free thank you for supporting us a second time around!\nFor Duelosaur Island and Totally Liquid it means a new X-treme edition box with spot UV box, metallic ink box and stretch goals that we can't afford to include in the retail editions of these games.  These will be Kickstarter exclusive editions that will not be available at retail, so grab 'em now!\nUpgrade Kits: For those of you who may already have a copy of Dinosaur Island and want an upgrade kit (all the X-treme edition goodies minus the exclusive Spot UV/foil cover art), we are going to offer that after the end of the campaign during the backer-kit or you can add 30 dollars to your pledge now per upgrade kit you want.  These are only available as an add-on item to another pledge tier and will ship when those items are available.  \nWe've been asking players what they wanted from a Dinosaur Island expansion for the last year+ and have been listening, working and testing (and testing, and testing) and Dinosaur Island: Totally Liquid is the result!  We'll be revealing Water Dinoz, new extensions and executives throughout the campaign so keep your eyes glued here for new content!\nAnd yes, we have been listening.   Introducing Moriya Labs, the 5th player expansion for the game!\nDinosaur Island: Totally Liquid adds lots of cool new mechanisms to the game on top of a 5th player setup.  The Blueprint Module gives all players bonus points for following the plans laid out on the card!   \nThe Park extension gives players a new extension to the board that gives them a unique way to score points and unique mechanics to explore separately from all other players.  The Executive Worker gives each player a unique worker to their corporation that acts completely differently from any other worker in the game.  \nBelow you see some examples from Mega Rex who is a really hard to make dinosaur (2 of each advanced DNA!) and is extra dangerous, but the guests love him!  Build seating and up to 8 guests will come to see him!   The CFO worker gives you a new way to make money by placing him on an item in the marketplace and gaining the payment for yourself instead of the bank!\n And we're just getting started.  PR events will be introduced during the campaign along with additional Executive workers and Park Extension boards!\nCheck out all the shmancy components in Totally Liquid!\nPandasaurus Games is proud to announce a brand new stand-alone 2 player sequel to Dinosaur Island: Duelosaur Island!  \nDesigned by Ian Moss and developed by Dinosaur Island designer Jon Gilmour, Duelosaur has completely unique mechanics that make it an amazing experience that is sure to add to anyone\u2019s collection.\nDuelosaur Island brings back a lot of the same feeling that players loved about Dinosaur Island, but introduces an entirely new hand-management tableau-building engine that is unlike anything you\u2019ve seen in Dinosaur Island, and a really tense \u201cI cut you choose\u201d dice drafting mechanic.  The first-player will roll the DNA dice and give each die a different bonus, with the second player choosing the DNA to take first.  So, do you give the DNA you want the best bonus and risk your opponent taking it?\nDuelosaur is built around a clever hand management mechanism. Each card in the game serves 3 potential purposes. They contain the DNA sequences for dinosaurs you could create, the blueprints for attractions you can build and also are discarded to take certain actions. Do you create the Dinosaur on the top of the card attracting guests to your park? Or do you build the attraction on the bottom of the card, which can grant PR bonuses, income and end-game VP? Or do you discard the card to combine DNA towards creating another dinosaur. Duelosaur Island comes with 5 brand new full-color \u201cDNA dice\u201d. You can mix and match dice between Dinosaur Island and Duelosaur Island for even more variability in both games. Adding a copy of Duelosaur Island to your collection is going to unlock lots of cool new possibilities in Dinosaur Island like the brand-new security symbol that can appear on dice to upgrade your security level instantly! Mixing these dice in with the Dinosaur Island dice is a great way to add replayability to both Duelosaur Island and Dinosaur Island.\nDinosaur Island Rulebook\nDinosaur Island: Totally Liquid  Alpha Rulebook (non-final layout, non-final text)\nDuelosaur Island  Alpha Rulebook (non final layout, non-final text)\nPandasaurus Games will be working with partners to deliver the game worldwide. This project will be EU, Canada, China, US and Australia friendly!  \nAfter the campaign ends, we will be charging actual shipping costs. We want to strike a fair balance of value for our backers while ensuring high quality fair shipping prices for each backer. By shipping within the EU, Australia, China, Canada and the United States we are hoping to get as favorable of shipping rates as possible. We will be working with well-vetted partners in each region who have experience with Kickstarter reward fulfillment and come highly recommended by other publishers within the industry, and will take into account good (and bad) experiences that other publishers have experienced.  \nOur goal is for the average shipping costs for backers in the EU, US, Canada, Australia and China to be under 20 USD with shipping for backers outside of these regions to come from the most cost-effective area for the lowest possible shipping price.  \nBackers in some regions, especially the Middle East, Africa, South and Central America may experience high shipping fees which reflect the actual cost of shipping to these areas in excess of 50 USD. Please be aware of this before backing the project.\nWe are proud to partner with Quartermaster Logistics, the premier provider of Kickstarter fulfillment in the gaming industry. Your games will be safely packed by their professional team, and you\u2019ll be emailed a tracking number when your package ships. Learn more about Quartermaster Logistics at qmlogistics.com\nSplitting Shipments\nAfter the campaign ends, we will allow backers to split shipments of titles so that they ship as they become available.  This will be up to individual backers if you wish to get games earlier or wait for all items to become available to ship together to save money.   \nFor example if you pledge for the base game + Totally Liquid we expect the base game to be available this Summer while Totally Liquid won't be ready until the Fall.  You may choose to split the shipment to get the base game first or you can wait until both are ready to ship to save on shipping costs.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPandasaurus Games is a 6-year-old board game publisher who has delivered hundreds of thousands of board games worldwide. We are confident in our ability to deliver the rewards listed and on time.\n\nDuelosaur and the base game are art complete and set to begin the pre-proof process with the printer during the campaign to ensure timeliness. Totally Liquid is 80% art complete and will finish during the campaign. Short of a production issue with some of the bespoke components, delays in shipping or issues with proofing that require reworks, we intend to release the game on time. We will always choose quality production over timeliness, so delay of the game is possible, but we will be ready to hit the printer with final components right at the end of the campaign.\n\nThere is the chance of delay in shipping or customs that is largely out of the control of our company, but we are experienced in moving products through customs. Of course, with multiple freight solutions going to various parts of the world it's possible some regions will get the game more quickly than others.

Join either the Pan Pacific Defence Corps or the invading Kaiju, and face off in a battle with the ultimate stake: extinction.\nGetting started in Pacific Rim: Extinction is easy; the core set contains everything you need to start playing, including painted ~ 75mm Gipsy Avenger and Shrikethorn miniatures, dice, cards, tokens, buildings, terrain, Hex Gauge measuring tool, poster mat, and more.\nThe Miracle Mile All-In Pledge contains everything you see in the graphic here below PLUS all applicable stretch goals!\nNote too that the Miracle Mile All-in pledge level is only available during the Kickstarter campaign, though all expansions and bundles will be available on the pledge manager.\nExtinction Pledge Level\nThe miniatures of Pacific Rim: Extinction stand between 75-100mm tall, and close attention has been paid to bring the truly larger-than-life appeal of these huge machines and monsters straight to your tabletop!\nWith your support, we can add even more to the game, and offer expansions so you can choose your favourite Jaegers and Kaiju from both Pacific Rim films to bring into battle!\nHelp us break through these goals, and unlock two types of content:\nBonus content sets, which add more cards, components, and customisation options into the core set (and expansions).\nOptional Buys, which you can increase your pledge to purchase (see below for a guide on how to do this). These are full expansions containing new Jaegers or Kaiju.\nIn Pacific Rim: Extinction you\u2019ll be able to customise your force of Jaegers or Kaiju, using the machines, monsters, pilots, and mutations you favour to build up your personalised team! Take a look below to see all of the optional buy Expansions currently available.\nIf you want to expand your game with one or more of these optional buys, all you have to do is click on the \u201cManage Your Pledge\u201d button on the Pacific Rim: Extinction Kickstarter page, which appears once you have made any pledge. Then increase your pledge by the total value of the expansions you would like to purchase.\nFor example, if you have pledged at the standard core set level (which is \u00a335), and you would also like to receive the Saber Athena and Hakuja Expansions, you would click on the \u201cManage Your Pledge\u201d button, and increase your pledge from \u00a335 to \u00a375 (\u00a335+\u00a320+20=\u00a375).\n\nAfter the campaign, we will be using a pledge manager to confirm which expansions you have paid for, so they can be added to your rewards! \nKaiju Red Combat Dice!\nThe Guardian Bravo and Raijin Expansion Sets can be purchased together in the Escalation Bundle for \u00a340, which will also include the Slattern Expansion Set when we unlock its stretch goal \u2013 meaning you\u2019ll be getting 3 expansions for the price of 2!\nCherno Alpha, Crimson Typhoon, and Otachi feature in this bundle. 3 Expansions for the price of 2!\nGipsy Danger is a true Jaeger legend, and a shining beacon of humanities\u2019 strength and courage in the face of insurmountable danger. A veteran fighter, Gipsy Danger\u2019s name has been etched into history for her heroic actions during the Kaiju Wars.\nDouble up on the buildings from the core set with this optional buy.\nGet another full set of dice and an extra hex gauge with this optional buy.\nA close-quarters combat specialist, Saber Athena is the sleekest and most elegant Jaeger ever created. With her ultra-light frame and hyper-tensile muscle strands, she can leap, tumble and kick higher and faster than any other Jaeger.\nA category IV Kaiju, Hakuja can harness the elements of stealth and surprise by plunging into the ground, burrowing beneath the feet of its target to emerge in an explosive surprise attack.\nKnown for her sheer stopping power, Bracer Phoenix is a Mark-5 Jaeger that manages to hold her own among her Mark-6 successors. Because of the complement of artillery she carries, Bracer Phoenix is one of the heaviest Jaegers in the PPDC fleet.\nObsidian Fury poses a unique threat to the PPDC. With an unknown origin, and a configuration and call sign not found in any PPDC database, this titanic mech is capable of moving faster and hitting harder than any Jaeger in the Moyulan fleet.\nOf the Mark-6 fleet, Guardian Bravo is perhaps the most well-balanced unit, capable of fulfilling various offensive and defensive roles. She is fully-equipped with next generation J-Tech weapons and armour.\nRaijin is the second of only two Category V Kaiju ever to be encountered by humanity. Its head possesses unique shield-like plates which act like a monstrous Venus flytrap.\nUnpainted render. Painted version coming soon.\n We will be updating this section to include new videos featuring Pacific Rim: Extinction. We have a lot planned, so more will be added throughout the campaign.\nAlessio Cavatore, one of the game designers, chats to the folks at Beasts of War about Pacific Rim: Extinction.\nTake a closer look at Pacific Rim: Extinction in the \u2018How To Play\u2019 video from Geek & Sundry! We\u2019re really excited to show off more of the game mechanics, and to show things in motion.\nPacific Rim: Extinction can be played with two or more players in either a \u2018Quick Play\u2019 or \u2018Constructed Battle\u2019 format. Quick Play involves using \u2018Quick Play Cards\u2019 which are included in the core set, and contain easy set-up guides so beginner players can focus on the fight without distraction.\nBUILDING YOUR TEAM\nIn Constructed Battle, you\u2019ll be able to fully customise the Jaegers and Kaiju to your own preferences, then pit them against each other in an intense objective-based battle. The Kaiju player chooses the scale of the attack based on the combined Category Rating of all Kaiju in play. This is known as the \u2018Threat Level\u2019. The Jaeger player then builds a PPDC response force. Jaegers, Rangers, and Upgrades all have points values, and the total points of a Jaeger team must be equal to or less than double the Kaiju Threat Level.\n\nThe goal of the game is different depending on which side you choose to fight with. As a Kaiju player, you\u2019ll uncover a secret objective at the start of the game. To win, you\u2019ll need to meet this objective, ideally without revealing what it is to the Jaeger player too early. As a Jaeger player, your goal is to fulfil the PPDC\u2019s task: the protection of humanity. You\u2019ll need to defend cities as Kaiju trample them, and take down the immense invaders.\nThe Jaegers and Kaiju each have their own abilities and customisation options. Using the 'Jaeger Conn-Pod\u2019, \u2018Upgrades\u2019 can be applied to improve the machine\u2019s weapons or other capabilities, while each 'Kaiju Signature\u2019 can be altered with \u2018Mutations\u2019, making the monsters even more dangerous and unpredictable. As they clash, \u2018Action Cards' are used to carry out the attacks and manoeuvres of both sides. Using these tools, the Jaeger and Kaiju must outwit, outmatch, and overcome their opponent.\n\nCONN-PODS AND SIGNATURES\nThe Jaeger Conn-Pod has a  number of key features are labelled in the image: \nJaeger Conn-Pod\n1) Jaeger stats, including Speed, Skill, Power, Armour, and Points values.\n2) Ranger slots, where the Ranger Cards chosen for this battle are placed.\n3) Charge counter, where the current charge of the Jaeger is displayed.\n4) Ammo counter, similar to the Charge counter, this displays the current Ammo.\n5) Structure points, which show how much damage the Jaeger can take before it\u2019s destroyed.\n6) Upgrade slot, where an Upgrade Card is placed. There are many different upgrades that are used to modify and customise a Jaeger.\nThe Kaiju Signature is used like the Jaeger Conn-Pod but by the Kaiju player. It has a number of gameplay relevant features as indicated: \nKaiju Signature\n1) Kaiju stats, including Speed, Skill, Power, Armour, and Category rating.\n2) Rage counter, where the current Rage of the Kaiju is displayed.\n3) Mutation slots, where offensive and defensive Mutation cards are placed.\n4) Structure points, which show how much damage the Kaiju can take before it\u2019s killed.\n5) Kaiju Blue counter, where the current Kaiju Blue level is displayed.\nACTION CARDS\nDuring a game round, players control either Jaegers or Kaiju on their turn by playing \u2018Action Cards\u2019. These represent all-out attacks, cunning tricks, solid defences, secret weapons, and everything else the machines and monsters can do!\nEach miniature has a set of 6 specific Action Cards, with four main features which are labelled in the image: \nAction Cards\n1) The identification, showing which model the card belongs to.\n2) The title of the card, the name of the weapon or ability.\n3) The action(s) you can choose to perform that turn.\n4) The \u2018Damage\u2019, the effect of which varies from card to card. This represents different parts of a Jaeger or Kaiju being hit and damaged.\nDAMAGE\nWhen Jaegers or Kaiju take damage, the player who dealt the damage takes an action card at random from their opponent and reads the Damage section of the card to find out what happens. There's a chance that a critical part of Jaeger machinery, or Kaiju biology, will be struck with massive consequences. The Action Card that was drawn as Damage is then discarded, and cannot be used for the rest of the game. In this way, dealing damage to an enemy not only brings them closer to destruction but can also render weapons or abilities useless.\nWhen a unit takes damage its Action Cards are flipped and discarded.\nWhen a Jaeger or Kaiju has taken Damage equal to their Structure Points total, they are destroyed! If either the Jaegers or Kaiju are all destroyed, the surviving side will have claimed victory, but winning isn't always that simple. If the Kaiju meet their objective before they are all killed, they win the battle and the PPDC will be forced to retreat. Every Scenario and Objective Card will change the way the battle must be fought and won, often drastically.\nKnowing your enemy and accurately predicting their actions will be an invaluable tool in defeating your opponent in Pacific Rim: Extinction. Below, the designers give some tips on how to gain the advantage in the battle:\nTACTICS\nKnow your Hex Gauge. Learning how to move your Kaiju and Jaegers with finesse is a very important skill. When moving, you may move your model up to its Speed value forward and make one pivot. Jaegers can pivot left or right, one Hex side after each move. Kaiju can pivot left or right, one Hex side before or after each move. This means that a Jaeger has to telegraph their moves whereas a Kaiju can be more fluid and react to changing situations better. Either way, learning how quickly you can turn and when to commit to a plan of action is very important!\nFlanking. In a one on one fight it\u2019s hard to get around your foe, but with allies, it can be considerably easier. When attacking a target from the back arc (the three hexes behind it) the target does not get to use their skill to defend, a great way to crack particularly defensive Kaiju! The worst position to be in is sandwiched between two enemies, with no way to turn without presenting your weak spot to someone! Some Jaegers and Kaiju have special abilities that allow them to get out of such sticky situations like Hakuja's burrow - allowing the Kaiju to dig underground and come up in another location. Saber Athena can leap into combat, sliding around her enemies to strike from behind with her special flying knee attack!\nWe will be charging shipping once the Kickstarter is over, based on the actual costs.

Your goal is to explore five islands floating around the gravitational force of a mysterious crystal.\nThe game is a carefully crafted fusion of hand-management and area control, with hefty player customization, asymmetric gameplay and a variable scoring system.\nThe area control aspect of the game is based on a dynamic map that is constantly transforming thanks to player action and choice.\nThe shifting game map means that player strategy has to take into consideration the possibility of change just around the corner, creating a new layer of strategic depth to time tested area-control mechanics.\nFor example, a player could suddenly move his entire army by shifting the land beneath them. He could split a rival Champion from his troops, or endanger him by driving him closer to a monster. In Mysthea monsters move and attack abruptly, and are almost invincible when challenging a single Champion. Players must cooperate for a chance to defeat them. These are just a few of the possible strategic outcomes that these mechanics enable.\nPlayers start the game with a small set of cards and they can acquire new ones from a common display during their turn, increasing possibilities and strategies. Each card is unique, making the hand management mechanism the other core aspect of the game. Deciding when and how to use a card is a huge part of Mysthea, since players will collect them back at the start of each new Era. This means that every card can be used multiple times in different ways. This creates a deep and tense tactic and strategic planning, always very different and highly customizable to your favorite play-style.\nDuring gameplay, players will face encounters with two possible paths on a card and will have to choose the one that seems to bring the best outcome for their Champion\u2019s journey. In this image, for example, you could choose to make a surprise attack on a camp, probably influencing other players. Or you could ignore that option to explore the curious crystal structure in the distance, hoping to find something that could empower your Champion. What would you choose?\nPlayers will combat monsters and other players, strategize and perform many other actions during gameplay that can grant endless strategic possibilities. Read our in-depth articles on our website, download the rulebook or watch a video preview to have a complete overview of all the game mechanics and the gameplay experience you can expect from Mysthea.\n\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u30eb\u30fc\u30eb\u306f\u3053\u3061\u3089\u3067\u3059\nMillenia ago, a planet called Icaion was hit by a giant crystal of unknown origins from the depths of space. With staggering force, the crystal pierced through the celestial body. The impact was so strong that the planet, and the forces governing it, changed forever.\nFast forward thousands of years. A region made of the chunks of land that broke off from Icaion due to the force of impact is now inhabited by a prosperous society. The lands floating above the clouds were named Mysthea by their inhabitants.\nThe shards of the crystals that were scattered across Mysthea have been found to possess great powers, which the people have harnessed to perform incredible feats. The crystals are called Qoam and the inhabitants attune themselves to their unique magnetic field to move them telekinetically. The lands of Mysthea are ruled by a Kingdom, but the King has long since ducked into the shadows of his empire, delegating the management of the state to sovereign Guilds. Each Guild is tasked with representing the interests of a particular part of the population.\nRecently, for the first time ever, humans have managed to create an artefact that is able to amplify the power humans have over the crystals. One artefact for every Guild was created. They were considered tools of immense power and for a while, they were used rarely, mostly in ceremonious circumstances, until one Guild realized that with the aid of the artefact, they could send an explorer to the uncharted islands floating around the Crystal. For the first time in history, they would be able to explore those terrifying, sacred places. They could touch those lands considered holy by some and damned by others.\nThe kingdom buzzed with excitement when each Guild announced that they would fund expeditions, entrusting the artefact to a Champion who would travel to these harsh new lands in hopes of finding great rewards.\nHumans are naturally able to interact telekinetically with Qoam crystals. But, some are more predisposed than others and are able to perform amazing feats. True masters can use Qoam as weapons, weightless to the user and deadly to their enemies, or to create armor stronger than any other worldly material that doesn\u2019t compromise their mobility. Each master has developed a unique and personal use of the crystals, sensing and seeking out shards that vibrate with a frequency that is easiest for them to attune to.\nThe Champions of Ilvash come from different backgrounds, and manifest different abilities when interacting with Qoam. They are highly revered and are able to live off their talent. They sell their services to Guilds or to private citizens. Some think they join the expeditions to the unexplored islands for monetary compensation alone, but each of them have ulterior motives for facing such great dangers.\nDuring the long years since the collision, new life spawned alongside humans. This peaceful, and sometimes advantageous, coexistence between monsters and people is taken for granted by the citizens of Ilvash. But those who have experience in the less inhabited regions outside the city walls know that creatures that are common and cooperative in the city can become aggressive in certain areas of the world. When hit by the energy of the Crystal they transform into mighty and terrifying beasts. \nWant to find out all the details of the game\u2019s lore?

They expand your gameplay options to give you even more great content.\nHere is the complete list of all the optional buys available and their price:\nIf you're interested in purchasing any of these optional buys, please click the \u201cManage Your Pledge\u201d button on the Batman\u2122: Gotham City Chronicles Kickstarter page, and add the amount of the items that you would like to get in the pledge manager. You don\u2019t have to specify what you want at this stage. We will sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed, when we send you a link to our pledge manager.\nClick on the picture to learn more about the Villain Campaign Pack\n                      The mini-campaign takes place on the four maps of the base box(es). You will play as Bane and some of the worst criminals of Gotham City he has allied with. Bane\u2019s plan is to use them to take over the city and break its protector, the Dark Knight. Also, and this is very important, you will require a copy of the Versus Mode add on to play these scenarios.\nClick on the picture for more details about the Wayne Manor Expansion\n This expansion includes 2 game boards: Wayne Manor and the Batcave, each of which includes 3 scenarios. The Batcave is divided into 4 boards to allow players to move into the well-known location under Wayne Manor, but also to other buildings, like those created by Batman Inc. This expansion contains only hero miniatures, like Bruce Wayne, Alfred and his daughter Julia. It also includes ally tiles for use in scenarios, or with the Command skill, and in the Versus expansion. Oh, and there is also a T-Rex!\nClick on the picture for more details about the Arkham Asylum expansion\n                                                  This expansion includes 2 game boards: Arkham Asylum and Jokerland, coming with 3 scenarios each. Jokerland will include various attractions, shaped as double-sided overlays, which provide a lot of replayability, as the combination of attractions change with each scenario. These attractions offer unique atmospheres and terrain types that change the way you navigate the map. Of course, you can\u2019t imagine an expansion like this without thinking about the villains. This box is absolutely brimming with bad guys and you won\u2019t find a single hero among them. Within you will find a horrific faceless version of the Joker, as well as the Mad Hatter and his inseparable sidekicks, the Tweedle brothers.\nClick on the picture for more details about the Versus Mode expansion\n                                                     Good versus evil. Light versus darkness. Heroes versus villains. Opposition is the core of the Batman universe. Sometimes villains turn to heroes and heroes to villains, blurring the lines, but the dichotomy is always there.\nTo represent this opposition, we developed a whole new mode which pits one player against another, each of them controlling their forces through their own command board, giving a more \u201cskirmish\u201d feel to the game. This mode adds an activation pool with a recovery system (very much like the Reserve and Fatigue zones work), dictating the pace of the game by allowing the player to decide how many tiles they want to activate each turn.\nThis expansion includes an additional plastic command board, 20 activation disks, and 55 tiles to play the Hero\u2019s characters. It also adds 12 ally miniatures on the heroes\u2019 side, boosting their forces to face the already numerous goons of the villain\u2019s side. Finally, the expansion comes with 8 dedicated scenarios and, of course, the rules to play the Versus mode.\nThis expansion includes the Batmobile and three scenarios: one for the Bank map, from the base game, one for the Batcave map from the Wayne Manor expansion, and one for the Jokerland map from the Arkham Asylum expansion. The Batmobile is played by the heroes, but does not function independently as a hero. Heroes will control it through a special tile which allows them to create shortcuts by destroying walls or to neutralize hordes of villains.\nBatman\u2122: Gotham City Chronicles is a scenario-based miniatures board game where 2 to 4 players control the Dark Knight and his allies in their never-ending battle against crime through an asymmetrical and open game system.\nEach game involves an action-packed fight where two sides face off. One of the players assumes the role of the Villain and controls the most notorious criminals of Gotham City. The remaining players take control of the Heroes, who must work together as a team to foil the Villain\u2019s plots. Each side takes turns, pitting their strategies against each other in order to achieve their objectives.\nThe heroes and the villain playing one of the 20 scenarios of the base game\nEach game of Batman\u2122: Gotham City Chronicles is played according to a scenario which describes the plot, location of the action, setup of the game, number of turns, and the specific objectives each side is trying to achieve in order to win the game.\nThe game involves two opposing sides: the heroes and the villain. We wanted to represent that dynamic up front by making it obvious from the art on the boxes. That's right, boxes, because one box will not be enough to fit everything you will get.\nBut this separation has another purpose: it eases the setup of the game. The hero box contains the hero boards, screens, cards...everything the heroes need to play a scenario. The villain box contains the miniatures, tiles, dice, and everything needed to prepare the command board for the fight to come. These 2 boxes will constitute the core game, which include all the base offerings plus all the Stretch Goals we're hoping will be unlocked during the campaign.\nClick on the picture to download the WIP rulebook.\nClick on the picture to download the WIP rulebook.\nClick on the picture to download a scenario\n                                   Cliquez sur l'image pour t\u00e9l\u00e9charger un sc\u00e9nario\nEach player on the heroes' side controls one or many characters.\nAt the beginning of a scenario, the players may choose which hero they want to play from a large roster.

The more actions they perform, the more exhausted they become.\nBut when a hero gets wounded, they must transfer energy cubes from their fatigue zone to their wound zone, diminishing their capacity to perform actions in future rounds.\nThe double-thickness bat-tablet with the energy zones\nTo better understand how a hero board works, please watch the following 3 videos from Wayne Entertainment:\nA hero can also carry equipment cards, placed next to their hero board. These cards grant bonuses to the hero when performing actions but have a weight that might slow down the hero or reduce their skills.\nEquipment cards (size: 42 x 63mm)\nFinally, some heroes of the bat-family have access to the latest innovations from Wayne Enterprises and can have bat-gadgets. These bat-gadgets also grant bonuses but do not have a weight as they fit into their utility belt.\nBat-Gadgets cards (size: 42 x 63mm)\nA hero setup\nFacing the heroes is one player: the villain.

This large scale allows us to create highly detailed miniatures, with dynamic poses that are easier to paint.\nBut some of our models are even bigger, like the hulking Bane, towering Clayface, and the gigantic T-Rex!\nFrom left to right: the gigantic T-Rex, Clayface, Killer Croc, Bane, and Montoya\nTHE BASES\nAs you may have noticed in the images above, the bases of our figures are no longer plain. Indeed, we are moving the quality of our miniatures one step further by offering textured bases so your figures look even better on the game board. Instead of having one base for all your miniatures, we have created 5 different bases of 30mm that will be used for \"human-sized\" figures. Larger miniatures like Killer Croc will have a 45mm textured base and unconventionally large characters like Clayface will be placed on a 60mm textured base.\nA 3D render of the five 30mm bases\nOUR EXPERIENCE\nThis is our third Kickstarter project that features hundreds of miniatures. We have gained a lot of experience crafting these kinds of complex miniatures from the sculpting stage to the final model you will have in your hands. With Mythic Battles: Pantheon we actually set a new standard by using ABS (a harder plastic compared to the standard PCV) for thin sections (such as knives and ankles) and straight components (such as swords).\nAs you can see on these production plastic samples, the spears are perfectly straight, as they are made of ABS hard plastic.\nThis experience allows us to offer very high-quality miniatures without bendy parts, that are regarded as the best available.  \nAdventure mode by Beasts of War (EN):\nLet's play! by Beasts of War (EN):\nHow to play by Barry Doublet (EN):\nDe l'explication par Trictrac (FR) :\n De la partie par Trictrac (FR) :\n Learn to Play: Kickstarter Overview (EN):\n Learn to Play: Conan VS Batman (EN):\n The Dice Tower plays (EN):\nAll pledge levels will be available in both English and French.

Par exemple, Gueule d'Argile s\u2019appellera Clayface.\nWe will offer translations in German and Spanish, available to download as PDF when the game will be delivered. However, only the rules and scenarios will be translated. The rest of the components contain relatively little text: the name of the asset cards and the name of the characters will remain in English. For example, Clay Maw will be called Clayface.\nFor a very simple reason: the game contains a lot of work and high-quality components on top of the cost of the Batman license.\nTo be able to offer you this game at a reasonable price, we had to cut our margins as low as possible. We cut them so much, in fact, that we cannot reduce them any further. Therefore, if we were to sell this game to a distributor, who then would sell it to retailers, the final price of the base game for you gamers would be multiplied by 2.5. That would be more than $350 for the base game only!\nWe talk from experience as we offered Conan, our first Kickstarter project, through retail a few years back, and it turns out, that we had to lower our selling price to the distributor so much that we did not make any money on this. And you will understand that this is not a very good business model for a company.\nBased on our Conan and Mythic Battles: Pantheon experience, we will be charging shipping once the Kickstarter is over, based on the actual costs. We will collect the information via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. We will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in China (Asia, Pacific and Japan backers), USA (USA), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers), and France (EU backers and the rest of the world). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $20-$25 to most states.\nCANADA: $30-$35 to most cities.\nEUROPE: $20-25 to France, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands. $25-35 to Spain, UK, Italy, Poland, Switzerland, Czech Republic and to most other countries.\nLATIN AMERICA: $50-$60 to most countries.\nBRAZIL: $120-130 to Brazil (including customs and tax fees)\nASIA: $27 to China and Hong Kong. $40 to most other countries.\nOCEANIA: $20-$25 to Australia. $50-55 to New Zealand.\nAFRICA: $50-55 to Morocco, $80-85 to South Africa, $140-145 to most other countries.\nDOM-TOM: $60-65 to R\u00e9union, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Mayotte, Guyane.\nWe cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally, and to the following countries:\nCuba, Iran, Burma (Myanmar), Sudan, North Korea and Syria.\nMonolith is a company founded in 2014.

Designed by David Turcziand illustrated by Mihajlo Dimitrievski, Dice Settlers features a modular board, over 40 Technologies to discover, and 51 custom dice.\nDice Settlers comes with a set of 51 custom dice, manufactured using the hot printing technology. This allows us to fully customize the image that appears on each die (and place a piece of Mihajlo's art on each die), which is then printed, and covered in varnish. The final clear coating makes the dice extremely durable - after dozens of plays you will see no wear on your dice.\nEach achievements set provides a number of quality upgrades or new content that can be unlocked during the project. We reveal new parts of each set regularly. For more details, see this update.\nDo you want to know how to play in detail? Check out the RULES or see the game played in the Runthroughs and Reviews section below\n.\nCurious to see the dice rolled?

While realistic resources are supplied by Stonemaier Games (many thanks Jamey for your support) and thus quality is guaranteed, producing quality custom dice is a long process, which will require us to approve samples and then check the final production quality on site, in China.\nEstimated production start date is about 3 weeks after the campaign ends and the lead time for most components is 90 days. The custom dice and all deluxe edition components may add up to 15 extra days, but we're confident that final delivery time will not be affected.\nAs soon as production is over, we will ship containers to our fulfillment centers. Our current plan is to ship rewards from at least 3 different locations. Backers from USA, Canada and Europe will receive their rewards from local fulfillment centres, while everyone else will get their game boxes from Poland. US, EU and Canadian backers will get their game boxes locally, without any taxes. \nShipping charges, listed under each pledge level, will be added in the pledge manager.

Now, during our thirteenth Kickstarter campaign, we already know the ropes, and we have the knowledge and the experience to face any possible challenges in our way.\n\nBackers from Australia, Hong Kong, Taiwan and most locations in Central America will most likely receive their rewards later than the rest of the backers. Backers from these regions will receive packages from Poland, send via local postal services. These packages are sometimes sent via surface mail, thus it may take up to 3 months for these packages to reach their destinations.\n\nOnce again we will be working with tried and true partners, whose procedures and production cycles we know intimately. Our current partnerships include fulfillment companies in the Europe and North America.\n\nHowever, in the unlikely event of anything going wrong, we have contingencies in place, as well as some spare time to deal with unexpected events. Still, an absolute worst case scenario may add a total of 15 to 30 days to delivery.\n\nMISSING/DAMAGED ITEMS \nWe are producing, packing and shipping large quantities of games, so there is always a chance of human error or damaging some game components.

Whoever can use their resources and automaton workers to earn the most Prestige when Opening Day comes will go down in history as the founder of the City of Gears.\nCity of Gears starts with 9 random city tiles placed in a 3x3 grid face down, waiting to be discovered.  With 18 different tiles, no two games are ever the same.\nOn their turn, players roll resource dice to gain Gears, Steam and Charges. Gears are used to either give yourself new powers or to make new connections that help you gain access to and control over new parts of the city (see example below).\nSteam can be used to deploy your automaton workers to city tiles.\nCharges can either rapidly move your workers around the city or can be used to destroy opponents' gear links or send opponents' workers back to their factory.\nWorkers on building tiles can activate buildings in the City of Gears, earning clever players a chain reaction of benefits (see example below).\nOnce the city is uncovered, Opening Day creeps closer and development speeds up in the city. The game will end immediately once the third Opening Day gear is drawn from the bag.\nPlayers who control parts of the city when Opening Day hits will earn extra Prestige. Whoever has the most Prestige wins!\nIf you are new to Kickstarter, the add-ons are the most confusing thing in terms of pledging since they do not work on a \"cart\" system like everything else does on the internet. In order to \"purchase\" an Add-on, simply add the cost of the add-on(s) you would like to your pledge amount.  \nExample 1: You live in the US and want to add-on the Juggernaut. You simply add $10 to your pledge amount as there is no charge for shipping for this add-on.\nExample 2: You live in Taiwan and you chose the Founders Pledge and would like to add another copy of the Founders Edition and two Juggernaut add-ons. You would add an additional $59 for the game, $2 for shipping and $10 for each Juggernaut, increasing your pledge by $81.\nAt some point after the campaign, we will send you an email with a link to the pledge manager, in here you will \"spend\" that extra money you pledged letting us know what add-ons you wanted before we ship your stuff.\nCost:\n  While we would love to offer free shipping, there really is no such thing. Shipping is really expensive and we have tried to come up with pricing that accurately reflects our cost to get the game into your hands without creating a logistical nightmare on our side. We expect that we'll have to come out of pocket a bit based on what we are charging and we are ok with that.  \nTracking:  \nWe will also be using non-trackable shipments in some cases in order to save on cost as tracking can add 30-50% or more in some cases. So please understand if we do not have tracking with your package we did so knowingly. Rest assured, that we will get you your game and any risk associated with a package not being trackable is on us.  \nDelivery time:  \nWhile we would love to get everyone their games at the same time, it is just not possible. There is a high likelihood that some areas of the world will get their games before others. Our commitment is to get the games ready and printed as fast as possible (we've already done a ton of the prep work). At the factory we will break out the shipments to each fulfillment company with instructions to them that they should begin shipping as soon as possible upon receipt. In addition, because we have complete control over the U.S. shipments, you will not be able to order and receive the game on Amazon (or from any other US retailer) before our backers have it.  \nOther:  \nLastly, we will be using fulfillment companies in different parts of the world and while we have done our best to ensure we pick good ones, ultimately, once the games get into their warehouses there is little control we have at that point. We have always done our best to bend over backwards for our customers and if for some reason there are any issues with damages, missing components or missing shipments we will make it right. It just might require some patience.\nWhy back this campaign?\nWhile we have had great success with other games like Deception: Murder in Hong Kong and Champions of Midgard, we are still a relatively small company and we just do not have the funds needed to fund every project we do without some help. Your pledge gets you a discount off of the $59.99 MSRP planned for this title in the retail version or the exclusive Founders' edition of the game. It also gets you access to exclusive city tiles and any exclusive stretch goals we unlock that won't be available at retail. Plus, if you live in the U.S the game will be in your hands long before someone can get it from an online retailer. If you live outside the U.S, we will do our best to get it into your hands first. Also, pledging helps get us closer to making the first ever board gaming yacht, the Monochromatic Vulpine, a reality (just kidding about the yacht...or are we?).\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a publisher that has brought more than a dozen games to market thus far, we feel confident in our ability to get this done.

The soothing sounds of a gently flowing river. The glow of the moon. A bountiful harvest. Basic human emotions such as fear and rage. Even death. They all have an unseen force guiding them. And while these forces work together to make the world what it is, they each aspire for influence over those who believe in them.\nDesigned by Kolossal's own AJ Lambeth, Kami-sama is a beautiful and intuitive strategy game set in rural Japan during the Edo period. Two to four players will assume the roles of Kami, the spirits of the land. Using a combination of asymmetrical player powers, area control, set collection, pattern building, and light card drafting, players will work to balance their Favor with the people and their connection to Nature in order to be crowned Kami-sama, the chief deity of the land.\n        The Spirit Way add-on expansion introduces four new kami\nDaikono, the kami of radishes\nKari, the kami of the hunt\nKitakori, the kami of ice\nYuma, the kami of dreams\nThese kami introduce new interactive strategies through their unique abilities. Additionally, the Spirit Way expansion includes the Merchant villager, one copy per villager deck, as well as the kami-specific components below.\nThe Awakened expansion will be unlocked upon reaching our first stretch goal. Throughout the campaign, more content will be added to make this a substantial expansion full of diverse content. The Awakened expansion will be an amenity at no additional cost to backers of the game! Further, it will not be available in the initial retail release of Kami-sama.

Though Kolossal is new to the industry, our President - Travis R. Chance - is not. Travis was a founder of Action Phase Games. He is an expert at Kickstarter, funding every game he brought to the platform, including Western Legends, Heroes Wanted, Kodama, and Aeon's End. Our team has spent the last 8 months preparing for the launch of Kami-sama in every way possible.\nThe game is easy to learn while providing interesting and diverse play each game. Combining familiar mechanisms in a unique presentation, we are confident Kami-sama will be in your game collection for years to come.\nThe game is beautifully illustrated by our friends at Gong Studios (Netrunner LCG, Charterstone).\nWe are committed to begin fulfillment of Kami-sama before the game is made available in retail.\nComponents and materials for the game are near completion upon launch. All files will be uploaded to our manufacturing partner within one week after the end of the campaign. This ensures timely delivery to our backers.\nBy backing Kami-sama through this campaign, you will receive - at no extra cost - The Awakened expansion. This expansion will include unlocked Stretch Goal content not available in the initial retail release of Kami-sama. We have many exciting and interactive goals planned for those who are backers of Kolossal's second release!\nHundreds of hours have gone into the design and development of this game to ensure a balanced and enjoyable experience. Through extensive global internal and open testing, Kami-sama provides a rich gaming experience like no other game out there.\nThe utmost thought and care were taken with regard to the theme and source material for the game. As with all of Kolossal's releases, we strive to show diversity and thoughtfully approach inclusion.\nKickstarter is the world's largest funding platform for creative projects. Every month, tens of thousands of people pledge millions of dollars to creative projects in dozens of categories.\nA person who supports a project is called a \"backer.\" The process of giving money to this project is called a \"pledge.\"\nIn return for your pledge, we (the creators of the campaign) are able to offer \"rewards,\" depending on the amount you pledge. For example, if you pledge $50 to help back the project, we'll offer you a copy of the game along with any stretch goals we achieve as soon as it is manufactured.\nYou can become a backer in just three easy steps:\nStep 1: Read through the pledge levels and rewards we're offering in the right sidebar of this page.\nStep 2: Click the large, green \"BACK THIS PROJECT\" button to the right of the trailer video at the top of this page.\nStep 3: Enter your pledge amount, and complete the steps for filling in your information.

Every backer is important to us, regardless of location, but the reality is that shipping is very expensive and is a cost we all need to share.

They use their Up Quarks and Down Quarks to create Protons and Neutrons, and use their Photo (Gamma Ray) cards to create Electrons. \nThey can either use these Subatomic Particles to either:  \n(1) Purchase Subatomic Particle cards that get mixed into a player's starter deck, making it more powerful, like this... \n(2) Build up the atom on their player mat (in order to claim Element Cards, which are what score them points) like this... \nWhen a player claims an Element, they also place two Goal Markers on the board, competing over control for additional end game points. The catch is, you can only place those Goal Markers only on End Goals that do NOT match the Element you just built. \nSo, if you built a Helium, you can place a marker on any End Goal spot except Helium. At the end of the game, you'll get points for End Goals based on the Elements you built during the game IF you have the most or second most Goal Markers on any given End Goal.\nPlayer can also remove weaker cards from their deck (cull their deck) by Annihilating cards from their hand for a cost of 2 energy, like this...\n         Play through the fundamentals of chemistry with Ion and Covalence AND Subatomic!

Players must win clans, either through an interactive bidding process that functions like a silent auction or through using their cards as actions, to take other players clans. Arkon's depth and replay-ability are tied to having cards that can be played in many ways and its use of interpersonal interactions (bidding, bluffing etc.).\n# of players: 2-4\nAverage game duration: 15-30 minutes\nArkon hinges around a few central dynamics. First, cards can be played in multiple ways. Players will constantly be challenged to make tradeoffs as they choose whether to use a card for some sort of advantage, keep it as a counter or use the card for its influence value to win a bid and move the player closer to winning the game. \nNext, Arkon employs a resource system based around silent auction bidding. Because all cards double as influence and winning bids is a key component of your victory condition, Arkon reduces the \"dead card in hand\" phenomenon.\n   \u2022 Unique Resource System: In Arkon, to acquire clans to win the game, you need to bid for them with influence. What this creates is a dynamic where players on all turns are looking at what they want to bid for and what they are willing to give up in terms of actions.\n\u2022 Pacing: After talking with our play testers, one of the most unique elements they highlighted was pacing. Most strategy card games are linear. You gather more resources, develop your engine and that creates momentum towards the victory. Arkon manages to have non-linear gameplay, while still making the win condition skill based through the multi-use cards. \n\u2022 Portable: With 52 cards and only one central deck, Arkon fits inside of a tuck box and can be played anywhere! \n \u2022 Stunning Art: Although there is a lot of visually beautiful games out there, we think Arkon delivers an incredibly high level of art for a small-box game, and we are really proud of that. We have top end artists and designers that have worked on games from Magic the Gathering to Game of Thrones TCG. \n\u2022 Replay Value:  One of the core focuses while building and testing Arkon was replayability. We play tested the game extensively, with over 200 external blind tests taking place at local gaming stores and meet-ups across California. If you look at reviews on BoardGameGeek from those who have played, we were blown away by the positive feedback! \n In Arkon players assume the role of a mysterious outsider who claims to be a fabled mystic from long ago. You enter the world of the Wildlands during a time of great unrest, where war and mistrust have sown deep divisions across the continent. As you wield your influence to amass support, you must choose\u2026.will you use that power to bring unity amongst the clans of the Wildlands... or will you seek domination....?\nRead more on the lore...\n                                             This tier is going to come with some pretty epic loot. First off, each backer will receive a custom etched wooden box with a deeply detailed engraving of the Wildlands world map on the lid. In addition, we will laser etch your name and backer # (or whatever phrase you prefer) on the inside.\nBelow are some shots from our early prototypes! These will continue to be refined as we play with modifications to the fine details to make this as crisp as possible in the final. THESE ARE NOT FINAL.\nOn top of that we will include a unique, brand new card in a speciality golden card border.

This kickstarter represents the culmination of 2 years of work on my gaming companies first product. Through ups and downs, managing of a 9 person team, and thousands of hours, we produced a tabletop game that I think is both beautiful and strategically deep. I was blessed to have the opportunity to work with my family and on something I believe in and for that I am immeasurably grateful.\nThis section is called, \u201cOur Story\u201d but really, I would love to tell you all about what I learned, why it matters and how that has shaped what we built.\nFirst, when you are working tirelessly on a project that is your baby, your interminable obsession, understand and respect that your team is not always going to be as obsessed as you. This is okay. These are people that are helping turn your vision into reality, and without them I would of never had the beautiful art, videography, cartography and graphic design that is in the game today.\nChoose something you care about. For me, gaming represents an amazing way to share a communal experience with people. In a game it doesn\u2019t matter your age, your religion, your race, your politics, your gender, your orientation or your income. It\u2019s about getting together over something common to all of us: a desire to have fun.\nSurround yourself with good people. This is easily the most important thing. Entrepreneurship is just flat out hard.\nListen to your playtesters. We playtested this game all across California and for well over a year. Sometimes it was good, sometimes it was harsh (especially at the beginning). Each time we recorded specific feedback on sheets and looked for trends and thus things we could improve. The best feeling in the world was going to our last dozen playtests and realizing that all our iterations and balancing had paid off with a game that was more interactive and more strategic.\nLearn that things will go wrong. Packages will get lost. The manufacturing will mis-cut prototypes. Your artists will ask for more money because you tell them to re-do something. Note that #1 this is inevitable and #2 when it comes to your team, take accountability. Your artist didn\u2019t screw up, you screwed up by not giving a detailed and nuanced enough description of what you wanted. Learn and grow from it.\nAll of these lessons went into shaping what Arkon is. I know you all have a lot of choices when it comes to games. I deeply appreciate you taking the time to look at Arkon, and I hope you will consider our game as an edition to your collection.\n If you are an retailer, with a verifiable brick and mortar presence, please contact us at admin@arkongame.com for bulk pricing.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our first Kickstarter and as such, there is always the possibility of delays.

Doctor Babylon, LEGION\u2019s head of technology and development, has unlocked the secrets of the cosmic power source Dark Matter and plans global armageddon. In the wake of LEGION\u2019s ascendance, a crack-shot team of hand-picked agents known as MAYHEM emerges, whose sole purpose is to destroy LEGION and take the world back. Will you use LEGION\u2019s Dark Matter-powered doomsday devices and super-weapons to wreak havoc on Seoul: The City of Tomorrow or will you join the band of gadget-wielding misfits to dish out some MAYHEM?\n\nAgents of Mayhem - Pride of Babylon is a team vs. team skirmish boardgame for 2 to 4 players. The game is played on a modular 3D board that is fully destructible. You and your opponents will play through a radiant story where every choice you make will have effects that ripple throughout the campaign. Play as either LEGION, an organization of super villains who have taken over the world, or as MAYHEM, a band of anti-heroes who will do what ever it takes to stop LEGION.\nIn every game, use the modular tiles to set up an entirely new cityscape in near-future Seoul, Korea!\n3D BOARD! - Play on a board made of modular tiles with 3D multi-level buildings that are up to 240mm high! Use the buildings as cover or to dodge an attack by jumping behind a wall. Take the high ground to gain elevation advantages and attack bonuses against your enemies. The modular tiles allow you to make hundreds of different game maps.\nLEGION troopers have surrounded a building in which they suspect a MAYHEM agent is holed up. Why storm the building and risk injury? Lets just blow the dang thing up and pick up MAYHEM souvenirs!\nDestructible Terrain - You can drive enemies from behind cover by triggering explosions. These explosions and your attacks will often cause damage to a building which will eventually cause it to collapse.\nPictured are MAYHEM's Fortune character and one of LEGION's Swarm Troopers!\nUnique Characters - Every MAYHEM and LEGION character has their own highly detailed miniature and a Character Board that outlines their stats and abilities. Each character has a unique gameplay style and you will have to choose the right team for each mission. Finding the right combination of characters and tactics is half the fun of Agents of Mayhem: Pride of Babylon. The other half is blowing stuff up!\nHollywood's Character Board shows all of his abilities, actions, upgrades and gadgets. Between games you can upgrade the character board.\nCustomizable Characters - Customize your characters before each mission with an arsenal of gadget cards that slide into their Character Board and Mayhem Cards that let them unleash crazy and hilarious powers.\nHere new hard won Gadgets are added to Fortune's character board.\nCharacter Progression - After every game, you will have the opportunity to unlock new Gadgets and buy upgrade tiles for your characters. Upgrades stay permanently in the character\u2019s board until you decide to reset the game.\nFast Skirmish Gameplay and Tactics - Alternate taking turns with your opponent in quick game play that keeps you involved at all times. On your turn, you take actions with one of your characters while your other characters regenerate some of their resources. There is no downtime and you fluidly take turns back and forth until the Mission ends.\nBackstrikes and Flanking Fire\nAimed Attacks\nHeight Advantage\nA close up of a game in progress. Fortune goes for the loot while Hardtack keeps Gaunt busy!\nStory Campaign - Play through an immersive campaign with a radiant storyline. Decisions you make have ripple effects that impact your future missions, assets, and abilities. Every group\u2019s experience is unique in an open world that can branch into dozens of different story-lines full of humor and awesomeness with hundreds of ways to win.\nHumor - Agents of Mayhem - Pride of Babylon is full of over the top action and humor.

Now play solo or cooperatively with your friends against Athena as either MAYHEM or LEGION. \nThe Solo Ad-On will be shipped in a second wave three months after Agents of Mayhem: Pride of Babylon has been shipped. This delay is necessary, since we estimate an additional total of 520 man hours to program the AI deck. A nominal shipping fee will be added during the survey.\nAfter saving the world in Saints Row IV: Gat Out of Hell, Johnny Gat is back for more action and incredible campaign story lines!

When we were approached to develop a board game utilizing our military tactical engines, we were taken aback. But the more we thought about it, the more excited we became about the near future Agents of Mayhem world. We decided to go for it and founded our new Sci-Fi and Fantasy division - Apollo Games!  \nWe have applied all of our award winning experience into the over-the-top and humorous Anti-Hero vs Super Villain theme of Agents of Mayhem. Now you will need to utilize real world military combined arms tactics to succeed, even if you can jump over buildings, stop the bad guys with your looks, or conjure up monsters from the earth! On top of this, we have developed a campaign system like no other board game, in which every decision you make can affect you in the future. \nShipping will be charged during your post-Kickstarter campaign survey on which you will fill in your shipping address.

Our last two projects 'Mare Nostrum - Empires' and '878 Vikings' were so successful, that we unlocked all of our stretch goals. 878 Vikings English language games began shipping only 3 months after the end of the Kickstarter campaign. Online Forum and BoardGameGeek ratings and comments are very high and positive.\n\n'Pride of Babylon' is 100% developed and project managed in the USA.

We will only be producing this game in English to speed up and simplify production and delivery. \n\nAs with every project, there can be unseen issues that can crop up.

Did you miss your chance to play it when the original edition was available? Did you play a friend's copy and can't understand why it ever went out of print? Did you play your own copy into ragged pieces like we did? Whichever one of those is true, or if this is your first look at the game, welcome to the campaign! It is a dream come true for us to bring this game from Jarratt Gray and Carl de Visser back to gamers everywhere!\nEndeavor: Age of Sail is a strategy board game set in the historic Age of Sail. Starting out in the crowded hub of Europe, you must struggle to dominate at home while sending ships to the closed regions of the world... and be ready to seize control when they open up! You'll compete to grow the most successful empire through a smooth combination of:\narea control (capture key cities and the routes that join them!)\nresource collection (get the assets to build your empire!)\nengine-building (construct the buildings to power your strategy!)\naction management (use your population and trade tokens wisely!)\nThe elegant gameplay is driven by five different actions (Occupy, Ship, Draw, Attack, and Payment), and five different attributes (Industry, Wealth, Culture, Influence, and Glory):\nThe way you build, combine, and manage those elements creates your empire. Your challenge will be to navigate the maps of the world as they unfold, and write the history books so that the Age of Sail describes your victory!\nFor a detailed description of gameplay, see the How to Play section below. \n      Endeavor: Age of Sail preserves everything about the original edition that you know and love. The satisfying pacing which begins briskly but grows richer and deeper with every turn, the always-interesting breadth of the choices available to you, that feeling of the world unfolding as the game progresses, it's all still there. And it's all driven by that surprisingly lean ruleset which draws its complexity from the interactions and tensions that it creates. So how did we improve on this? Let's take a look:\nExploits are the major new gameplay addition unique to Endeavor: Age of Sail. Sure you can play the game without them (and for your first play you probably should), but once you play with them you'll never go back!\nIn each game you'll deal out three random Exploits (or choose three you enjoy playing with). Like the regions of the world, Exploits are locked at the start of the game. Each Exploit is a historical event from the era that is related to two of the regions on the board. When both of those regions are opened during the game, that Exploit becomes unlocked, and players may now begin interacting with its unique mechanisms and scoring opportunities.\nFor example, the Spanish Main Exploit is related to North America and South America. When those regions open up, that means that the Spanish Main is now occurring in the story of our game. Players may now use the Exploit's actions to Fortify their cities using the provided tokens (making them costlier for foes to attack), and once they've fortified, can trigger a powerful mid-round payment of workers back home! In addition, a new scoring opportunity opens up. Amazing! \nEach Exploit comes with its own immersive new abilities and strategic possibilities, and the game includes all of the special components that are needed to carry them out. This exciting variety of possible Exploit combinations means that every game will drive player interest towards different regions of the world, and create new pathways to victory even for seasoned veterans!\nPlayers command major seafaring empires during the historical Age of Sail. You have your own player mat, where you track your empire\u2019s attributes, construct buildings that permit you actions in the game, and gather Asset cards to build your attributes and gain Glory!\nEach round, you\u2019ll construct one building (based on your Industry level), gain population (based on your Culture level), pay workers to free up buildings (based on your Wealth level), take actions, then manage your cards (based on your Influence level).\nAt the start of the game, player actions are mostly limited to interacting with Europe; using your population to activate your own buildings, you\u2019ll draw Asset cards to increase your abilities, and occupy Cities to gain their Glory and assets, and to control the valuable links between them.\nSoon enough, you\u2019ll construct buildings that permit ship actions, and this allows you to reach out to the closed regions of the world. By shipping to a region, you can begin drawing cards from that region; when its shipping track is filled up, the valuable Governor card is awarded and the region becomes open. An open region\u2019s Cities and links can be competed over just like Europe\u2019s.\nEventually players will run out of room to expand, and if you\u2019ve built buildings with attack actions, you\u2019ll be able to engage in combat. Drive your opponents from the cities they\u2019ve claimed, to deny them the city\u2019s Glory points and to break up their network of profitable trade routes!\nOnce seven rounds have passed, the game comes to an end and scores are tallied. You\u2019ll earn Glory for:\nHow well you\u2019ve improved your four attributes (Industry, Culture, Wealth, and Influence)\nThe Cities you occupy and the links you control\nGlory symbols on your cards and buildings\nSpecial scoring opportunities from this game\u2019s Exploits\nThe player whose empire has accumulated the most Glory wins! \n           Tom's Playthrough\n Tom's Final Thoughts\n       ...plus glowing praise for the original edition of Endeavor:\n\"A very elegant design with easy to grasp, easy to teach mechanisms. Rich choices of actions on a rapidly evolving world map. No randomness beyond initial setup. Plenty of strategy and tactics packed into a 75 minute play time window. A definite 10 after repeat playings. Bravo!\"\n~Thorwolf (bgg user)\n\"A fantastic game - just the perfect level of depth for non-gamers to grasp reasonably well, but plenty of room for strategizing as well! Well done to the designers! So many paths to victory - and each so beautifully balanced.\"\n~superbgg (bgg user)\n\"I was surprised at how simple Endeavor is. It looks so thinky and complex, but the game play is actually quite easy. What sets it apart is the uniqueness of its mechanics and how it covers its historical theme in a way that is much more complete and accurate than most games with the \"Age of Discovery\" theme.

Werewolves, Vampires, and other shadowy creatures reach out in the night to tear apart your people. But never fear, new Citizens have joined the fray - some specializing in taking out these dark creatures! \nValeria: Card Kingdoms - Shadowvale brings in a whole new set of Citizens, Monsters, Domains, and Dukes that you can play stand-alone using components from the base game, or mix with card stacks from the base game and previous expansions for all new experiences.\nValeria: Card Kingdoms - Expansion Pack #6: RELICS  \nIn Expansion Pack #6: RELICS, you'll discover a whole new mechanic that will give you a slight edge during certain actions. During setup, shuffle up the Relics and give one to each player. Each Relic has a unique power. During the game, use your Relic to get bonus actions or discounts on performing actions to amplify your progress in the game.  \nThe Relic expansion pack will NOT be available through retail. It will be available at conventions and possibly at the BGG Store. \nWe have several Relic cards planned as Stretch Goals. So, the more money we raise, the more limited exclusive content you will receive as our thank you to all of our backers.\nGame Setup with New Content\n  Valeria: Card Kingdoms is a fast-paced card and dice game that will have you and your friends slaying monsters, recruiting citizens, and expanding your domain.\nIn Valeria: Card Kingdoms, 1 to 5 players compete to build the greatest kingdoms in about 30-45 minutes.\nMonster Card Anatomy\nDark monsters have risen to terrorize the kingdom of Valeria. Use Strength to slay minions like pesky Dire Rats... and titans like the mighty Darkstalker... to earn rewards. Then, defeat the boss in each area to clear the land and earn rewards based on the amount of monsters you've killed in that area.\nCitizen Card Anatomy\nPlayers start with 1 Peasant and 1 Knight. Throughout the game you and your friends will use Gold to recruit a tableau of loyal citizens like the hard-working Lumberjack... the blessed Exorcist... or the Hunter. In a single game, there are 10 different citizens to choose from, and with the Shadowvale expansion, you'll have a total of 32 alternate citizen types to create nearly endless combinations and challenges. No two games will be alike.\nDomain Card Anatomy\nOnce you've recruited the right combination of citizens, you can buy powerful domains like Karloff Castle - that gives you strength equal to the size of your army, or King Tower - that lets you give another player magic to gain a Victory Point. \nDuke Card Anatomy\nEach player drafts a Duke or Duchess card at the start of the game, giving you secret ways to score bonus Victory Points. Follow the wishes of your patron and you may find yourself basking in the glory of victory.\nRelic Card Anatomy\nWith the new KS Limited Exclusive expansion pack, RELICS, you'll also draft a powerful Relic that will give you a small advantage performing certain actions in the game.\n  35 New Monster Cards in 5 New Monster Stacks\n  60 New Citizen Cards (10 Stacks Of 6 Cards Each)\n  20 New Domain Cards\nAll of the content above will be in the retail version of Valeria: Card Kingdoms - Shadowvale along with all necessary divider cards to merge everything into your original Valeria: Card Kingdoms box.\nUNLOCKED!\nWe've unlocked the following content thanks to all of our backers: \n5 Domain Cards - Martin Road, Opera House, Laborium, Legendre's Keep, Ancient Tomb\n2 Event Cards - Good Omen, Blessed Lands\n12 Citizen Cards - Alt. Knight, Alt Peasant\nWe also decided to include a Warden for the Undead Samurai monster stack! \nThe Missing Warden Now Included!\n  10 Relic Cards\nFor backers, the RELICS expansion pack will be included inside of your box of Valeria: Card Kingdoms - Shadowvale. The expansion pack will include a divider card. The RELICS expansion pack will NOT be available at retail, but will be available at conventions or the BGG store.\nUNLOCKED!  \nWe've unlocked the following content thanks to all of our backers:\n5 Relic Cards - St.Aquila's Statue, Staff of Urdr, Dragon Orb, Philosopher's Tome, Lich Sword.\nValeria: Card Kingdoms and all expansions are in world wide distribution. Please ask your local FLGS to order them for you. That being said, we do have some stuff that won't be available at retail (unless those Retailers are backers). \nAdd an additional $20 to receive the Big Box.\nDepending on which printing of Valeria: Card Kingdoms your copy is from and, and how many of our previous expansions and expansion packs you have, and whether or not you sleeve your cards, it is quite possible that the cards from Shadowvale will not fit inside your original Valeria box. Also, we're not done expanding Valeria: Card Kingdoms and you can look forward to more added content in the future.\nPlease read the FAQ to determine your card storage needs.\nIf you are running out of space, we're making a Big Box that will hold more and giving you a set of dice and an enamel coin to replace the boring First Player token. We've updated the plastic insert inside to hold more and the Mico will be working on a unique piece of art for the cover. \nValeria: Card Kingdoms comes with lots of wooden tokens and multiplier chits to use if you run out, but some folks want all their resource tokens to be wood, so we are offering an add-on pack of 140 additional wood tokens.\nAdd an additional $12 to receive more tokens.\nAdding extra tokens might affect the storage capacity of your original box, so you might also want to consider the Big Box add-on.\nThe original version of the Playmat is sold out. We've decided to make a new bigger version that takes into consideration the Agents expansion pack. The artwork is in progress and will be based on the Big Box image. We're leaning towards just a huge white dragon. \nAdd an additional $25 to receive the new playmat.\n                                                     Dice Tower Approved!\n                                                  Click to try out the Shadowvale cards on Tabletop Simulator!\n                                                                                                                                            Once again, Schwerkraft-Verlag, Pixie Games, and Crazy Pawn Games will be joining us on this print run! You can back here for those languages and they will be delivered to you by them in your language (to certain countries).\nSchwerkraft-Verlag - Germany and Austria.\nPixie Games - France and Belgium.\nCrazy Pawn Games - Spain.\n          Rewards will be customs and VAT friendly for all of the major shipping regions: US, CA, EU, UK, and AU. If you're just getting the English Shadowvale expansion, your rewards will ship directly from China. If you're getting Shadowvale in any other language, or if you are adding on the Big Box, your rewards will ship from a regional hub or from that language's production partner.\nWe like to support game stores around the world by offering the Kickstarter versions of the game to retailers during the campaign. We treat retailer backers just like other backers in that they receive their rewards before we release regular retail games into distribution.  \nWe ask that you commit to at least 1 case (12 games), but we only ask you for $1 until we are ready to ship out the games to backers. At that point, we will invoice you for $149 (wholesale price) and you will receive a discount on shipping. If you would like to be included, we ask that you back the campaign for $1 and email David at david@dailymagicgames.com. We will ship only to stores in the US, or to foreign stores with a freight forwarder with a US address.\nEvery game we create is a discrete project with its own development schedule, its own budget for production and marketing expenses, and it's own timeline for funding, production, and delivery. We bring each project to Kickstarter to give you, our fans and supporters, the opportunity to help us put the final touches on the game and to reserve your copies at the time when it will do the game the most good, both financially and creatively.  \nSome say that a creator should not launch a new project until their previous project is completed and delivered. That system might work for a designer who is self-publishing a game, but for an up-and-coming company like Daily Magic Games, that system is not viable. At any point in time we are working on a dozen projects in various stages of completion. Right now, for example...  \nFood Truck Champion shipped to all backers and will be in retail in February. \nSailing Toward Osiris is in final assembly and we expect to deliver it to backers 1 month late, in March 2018. Sailing Toward Osiris will be produced in English, German, French, and Spanish. Sailing Toward Osiris will debut at Origins 2018 and be released to retailers in June 2018. Available for pre-order.\nCrabs! is at the printer and we expect to deliver Crabs! to backers in March 2018 and to be on retail store shelves by July 2018. Available for pre-order.\nHorizons is at the printer and we expect Horizons to be delivered to backers in July 2018, debut at GenCon 2018, and hit retail stores in August 2018. Available for pre-order.\nSarah\u2019s Singularity did not fund on Kickstarter and is back into redevelopment. \nAlchemea, by Ian Stedman and illustrated by Claire Donaldson, is a reimagining of Ian's game, Magnum Opus. It is in beta testing.  \nCorsairs: A Valeria Adventure, by Wouter van Strien and Isaias Vallejo, illustrated by The Mico, was inspired by Wouter's game Wacky Pirates. During development, Corsairs evolved into a more strategic game than the original and is in beta testing.  \nSpaceways, by Philip duBarry and illustrated by The Mico, is a sci-fi pick-up and deliver / area control game set in the Horizons universe. This stand-alone sequel is in beta testing.  \nChocolatiers, by Isaias Vallejo and illustrated by Claire Donaldson, is a gateway game where players take on the role of chocolatiers boxing chocolates in crowd-pleasing arrangements. It is in beta testing and you can download the PNP at BoardGameGeek.  \nThieve's Den, by Alice Davis and illustrated by Denis Martynets, is a unique blend of card drafting and worker placement set in the world of 10 Minute Heist. It is in beta testing.  \nWe're hoping that our track record for successfully completing and delivering previous projects will give you the confidence to support Shadowvale, and that the forthright communications we present when projects do hit snags will assuage any fears that we're going to screw it all up. By the way, if you'd like to help us with any of our alpha or beta testing, please send us an email at contact[at]dailymagicgames[dot]com.\nDaily Magic Games is a designer-friendly and customer-focused publisher specializing in casual tabletop games that are easy to learn and play, yet layered with strategy and depth.  \nIsaias Vallejo, Wizard-in-Chief, Game Designer, and Developer  \nDavid MacKenzie, Conjurer and Game Developer  \nLevi Mote, Alchemist, Game Designer, and Developer  \nSarah Sharp, Enchantress and Convention Event Planner  \nDylan Pharaoh-Whitney, Sorcerer and Graphic Designer  \nWe are focused on listening to what our customers have to say and making sure that we are producing the type of games you want at the high quality you demand. We are actively involved in the Comments section of each Kickstarter and keep backers up to date with plenty of updates post-Kickstarter. We like to make casual and gateway games in an effort to get more people to the table. Our games are easy to learn to help new players get in to the game faster, but they're also layered with strategy for the more seasoned players. We're based out of Seattle, Washington and like to focus on the growth and promotion of game design in the Pacific Northwest. We've even started a playtesting event network called playtestNW to help local designers meet each other and engage with playtesters on a regular basis. Our hope is that we're helping designers build better games.\n  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDaily Magic Games is committed to delivering quality products on time. We realize that the publication of a board game can be complicated and, no matter how experienced the project creators and mangers are, some problems may occur. In an effort to reduce the likelihood of delays and mistakes, we have taken several steps to prepare for success:\n\n1. This game project, as well as the Kickstarter campaign itself, are in the hands of two well-seasoned professionals. David MacKenzie has been running Kickstarter projects since 2010 (Alien Frontiers, Sunrise City, King's Forge, Swinging Jivecat Voodoo Lounge, Valeria: Card Kingdoms, ManaSurge, Villages of Valeria, Quests of Valeria, Merchants of Araby, Go Nuts For Donuts, 10 Minute Heist), and Isaias Vallejo comes from a digital games background as production and studio director at Big Fish Games and has designed several successful board games: Sunrise City, Valeria: Card Kingdoms, Villages of Valeria, and Quests of Valeria.\n\n2. We are dedicated to backer communication and feedback. Throughout every campaign, we are as transparent about the process and as open to feedback as possible without jeopardizing production and delivery timelines.\n\n3. We have done significant pre-production. All the art and graphic design files for Shadowvale are completed with the exception of the stretch goals content. The art and design for the stretch goals content has been sketched out and is ready to push forward as soon as each goal is achieved.\n\n4. We have our manufacturer lined up and ready to begin the pre-press process as soon as the the files are delived. We hope that everything goes as planned, but if something falls through the cracks, we are ready and willing to employ every tool at our disposal to get the project back on track and running smoothly.\n\nThank you for your support!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 12 or more", "title": "Premium PNP Files", "descp": "Full-art, full-res, full-color Premium Print 'N Play PDF files.\nINCLUDES:\nPNP Valeria: Card Kingdoms\nPNP Flames & Frost\nPNP Shadowvale\nPNP Exp.

A mysterious outbreak has claimed the lives of nearly everyone there... what's worse is they are crawling the stores and commons as Zombies hungry for flesh. Only a few Survivors remain. Are you among the Survivors? Or are you one of the ravenous Zombies? The choice is yours in Tiny Epic Zombies!\nArm your Meeples for Survival with...\nBazooka and Katana included in Deluxe games only. Additional items unlockable through stretch goals.\n   Tiny Epic Zombies is a 30 minute, 1-5 player, game of survival that features 5 distinct play modes:\n1. Cooperative team-play with game controlled Zombies.\n2. Cooperative team-play with Zombies controlled by a non-team player.\n3. Competitive free-for-all with game controlled Zombies.\n4. Competitive free-for-all with Zombies controlled by a player.\n5. Solo.\nIn Tiny Epic Zombies, survivors are always on the run, collecting weapons, killing Zombies and working toward completing objectives. Completing 3 objectives can win you the game but if you're too focused on the objectives, the Zombies will overrun the mall and that will be the end of you.\nWhy Back This Project? \nGreat Gameplay! - Fast paced and easy gameplay gets you right into the action. Variable survivor and Zombie powers, and several objectives, keep you playing time and time again.\nGenerous Discount!

However, it will be available in limited supply at conventions, through contests, online at the BGG promo store, and directly from Gamelyn Games on our website or through our Amazon store. \n  GENERAL INFO: 1-5 players, 30 minutes, 5 play modes including competitive and cooperative play.\nTHEME: Modern day Zombie outbreak at the Echo Ridge Mall.\nHOOK: Fast paced, portable, and tons of replayability. Play as the survivors or the Zombies. Plus ITEMeeples!\nWIN: Survivors must complete 3 objectives - Zombies must kill all the Survivors or gain control of the Mall's Courtyard.\nOVERVIEW: Simplicity shines in Tiny Epic Zombies. \nBased on the mode of play, you will either play as one of the Survivors or as the Zombies.\nExample Survivor:\nNote: If your ammo and wound tokens ever meet, you're dead meat! So, keep your wounds low and your ammo high.\nIf you die, that character will turn into a Zombie and you'll have to draw a new character to play. If that happens too many times, you lose the game.\nAs a Survivor, your turn will consist of moving 3 times. Then based on where you move, you'll be able to do additional things. For instance, if you move into a room with a Zombie, you'll have to fight it by rolling the Zombie die. Or if you move into a room adjacent to a Zombie, you can spend ammo to shoot it. Killing a Zombie is actually pretty easy... but they just keep coming. Keeping them from overrunning the entire mall, while trying to accomplish your objectives, that is hard!\nAfter you've taken your 3 moves, you'll search the room. This is done by revealing the Search Card you are holding. Most of the time, you find something useful, like awesome items you can later pickup and equip to your ITEMeeples. Sometimes though, you may find a Zombie lurking in the corner. So be prepared.\nAfter you search the room, more Zombies flood into the Mall. Then it's the next player's turn. Simple as that.\nExample Objective:\nThis is one of many Scenarios in the game. Each Scenario presents an objective. You'll have 3 Scenario in each game. Complete all 3 and you win!\nExample Zombie:\nAs a Zombie player, not only will you control unique Zombies with special abilities, you will control ALL the Zombies! With your help, the Zombies will have a brain in addition to eating brains. Your game will be to overwhelm the players with clever placement and movement of the Zombies. Smother them with your Zombie horde and prevent them from completing their objectives. If you kill enough players or overrun the mall courtyard, you win.\nEveryone loves stretch goals, us included! However, due to the constraints of box size (this is a Tiny Epic after all) and due to a total weight limitation, in order to keep shipping costs affordable for everyone, we are limited on how many stretch goals we can offer.

We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 95% complete. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are working with an experienced manufacturing partner. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements and costs for when it comes time for shipping. We will provide tracking information for the boat when the games leave China.\n\n3. We are working with an experienced fulfillment partner. We are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way. They have fulfilled many projects and have proven to be communicative, punctual and respectful when dealing with our customers.\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication.

This new board game, designed by Adam Kwapi\u0144ski, is the result of a collaboration between Awaken Realms (creators of This War of Mine: TBG, The Edge: Dawnfall and Lords of Hellas) and Rebel (creators of Drako, Dream Home and K2) . It's a 1-5 players semi-cooperative Sci-Fi horror where you and your friends try to survive while attempting to fulfill your secret objectives that may sometimes collide. It will also enable full co-op as well as solo play experience. \nNemesis offers one-of-a-kind gameplay, that you currently won't find anywhere else in the board game world. It has been in professional development for over three years, so it already plays very well, provides good balance and contains a multitude of interesting mechanics, as proven by the prototype reviews below. \n\nIf you like Sci-Fi survival settings and ships swarming with alien life forms, you will love it - and if that genre was never on your radar, this game is likely to change your mind! \nBy backing this project on Kickstarter you will get all unlocked Stretch Goals for free to every Core Box! \n        Click to see details about sundrop\n                   *Out of all reviews / movies two were paid: Cardboard Rhino (rules presentation / tutorial how to play that took a lot of time to make!) and Man vs Meeple (which is a preview showing the game in detail). All other videos were not paid. \n Asymmetric crew members \n                                                                                                       During the game, you will control one of the crew members with a unique set of skills, personal deck of cards, and individual starting equipment. These heroes cover all your basic SF horror needs. For example, the scientist is great with computers and research, but will have a hard time in combat. Soldier on the other hand... \nYour characters complement each other and will need to collaborate in order to survive. There's one catch: you are never sure who can you trust! \nCinematic experience\nYou drift back from the cold void of the hyper sleep. At first, you only feel a tingling in your mouth and a taste of your blood, but soon all the other symptoms hit you. Your head is exploding. Your stomach is turning. A strange noise rings in your ears. This sound is loud, piercing. An alarm!\nFighting through dizziness, you open your eyes, the lights of other hibernation chambers blinding you momentarily. Broken glass. Wet floor. A stasis pod burst open like a ripe watermelon, dripping with red. The thing inside was once your friend. Now it barely resembles a human, ripped open from the inside - damage too severe for a simple stasis pod failure. You raise up and check if your other mates are all right. The good news is: they are. You all gather in the middle of the room, shivering, half-naked. The bad news is\u2026 plentiful. Ship stuck in the middle of nowhere. Many systems damaged. Bulkheads breached. Unknown contaminants in the air. You also hear noises in the hollow halls of the ship. You\u2019re not alone! \n\nPlaying Nemesis will take you into the heart of Sci-Fi survival horror in all its terror. A soldier fires blindly down a corridor, trying to stop the alien advance. A scientist races to find a solution in his makeshift lab. A hacker breaks into ship\u2019s navigational system and enables self-destruction. A pilot sets the alien nest on fire, while his friend seals himself in the control room. A traitor steals the last escape pod in the very last moment. All this \u2013 and other memorable actions \u2013 await! \nShip exploration\nOne of most important parts of Nemesis gameplay is exploration. Every room of the ship may contain useful items and enables a different special action, from activating fire extinguishers to cutting out infected tissue. This makes it necessary to reveal as many room tiles as possible. But beware, while searching for a proper room, you will make noise that may draw some uninvited guests. \nShip's layout is randomized before each game, so you are never sure what to expect behind next corner... \nUnique combat \nThis game is more about surviving than killing. When you face horrors from outer space, you may panic, and even if you manage to put up a fight, you will never know how much punishment your opponent can take. Killing intruders is a tough challenge, especially since ammunition is a rare commodity on the ship. \nEvolving Intruders \nJerry, big news! We\u2019ve received the first transmission with some preliminary data. It seems it\u2019s an auxotrophic, anaerobic, mineral-based trans-dimensional life form (what a mouthful). No DNA, XNA or anything else we could expect. Instead, a strange self-propagating crystalline structure. Outer skin layer? Pure Lonsdaleite! We've never seen more than few grains on Earth, and this thing is covered in it! Fifty percent tougher than diamond, go figure. \nIt sheds this outer skin during each development cycle, thanks to a violent thermochemical reaction. But that's not the worst part. You've heard about this research into weird crystals with a structure partially hidden in other dimensions? Well, our guys say these creatures employ a similar process. Much of their growth happens... elsewhere. Then, when they gather enough energy, they shift modified organs and body structures back into this world. The may also be native to deep space, as they survive vacuum well enough to put Tardigrades to shame. Anne also believes they\u2019re an extremely adaptable omnivore. Sounds scary, right? I hope the top knows what they\u2019re doing with this one.\nIntruders you meet on the ship are not only reacting to the noise you make but also evolve as the time goes by. The longer the game takes, the stronger they become. \nTime pressure\nEncroaching enemies are not the only thing that pushes you to work faster. The ship is already counting down to the emergency hyper-jump. If you fail to repair the engines before that happens, or if the jump catches you outside of your stasis pod, extreme acceleration is going to turn your character into a red splatter on one of the walls. \n\nWorld and design \nWe've reached for the stars. Asteroid mining was booming. Colonies on Mars and Venus approached self-sufficiency. Then, a wanderer came from far depths of the universe at half the speed of light. It glanced the Earth's moon, ripped it apart, threw out of its orbit, and caused catastrophic damage below. Solar system plunged into crisis.  \nStill, many chose to focus on profit, as the residue from the impact contained unknown minerals and exotic matter that made our plain old asteroids seem boring. Obsolete spaceships, previously used for colonizing the solar system, were refitted and crewed by people desperate enough to spend years in vast spaces between the stars, hunting for the next big catch. They became whalers of deep black, scavenging for comets, asteroids, dead proto-planets, and other strange objects coming from far corners of the universe.  \nClick to see full Intruder design\nMany disappeared. It was to be expected. Intercepting unknown objects at incredible speeds was not exactly safe. Then, there are rumors at least one crew found something they were not supposed to...", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have currently successfully finished 3 Kickstarter projects. While the Nemesis campaign goes live, we're in the middle of shipping the first wave of Lords of Hellas game. Soon after the end of this campaign, we estimate to start the shipping of The Edge: Dawnfall, which was delayed.\n\nThese two projects at this stage are managed production and delivery team, while Nemesis is on creative stage, so they do not collide. \n\nWe are confident about the delivery of the game - we have accumulated vast experience working on other titles and projects. The only risk factor, which can always happen, is a delay in delivery due to unforeseen circumstances. Even though the bulk of design work is already completed, as proven by many reviews, Nemesis is a huge and complicated title, and in pursuit of great quality it might take more time to complete. \n\nPlease note that this is not a pre-order and the final product might slightly change in the process or get delayed.

Of course this won't be a quiet night of relaxation! Gamble, brawl and drink the night away as you prove you have what it takes to keep up with the heroes you handle night after night. The Red Dragon Inn 7 can be combined with all of our previous releases, letting you mix up the characters (and the mayhem) for games with four or more players!\nIf this is your first time joining us, we suggest you check out our introduction to The Red Dragon Inn series of games here:\nClick this header to learn more about The Red Dragon Inn\n  For those of you returning to us from previous campaigns, we have some exciting news: The Red Dragon Inn 7 campaign is unique in that we are featuring no funding stretch goals. All game content is unlocked from Day 1!\nSo instead of stretch goals or social media achievements, we're just going to lump all the unlocked stuff into what you can pledge for RIGHT now. Check out the bonus content you're getting for just showing up:\nInstead of unlocking Promo Drink Cards with Social Media Achievements, we're just going to include 2 New Promo Drinks in the rewards for every backer getting a copy of the game!\nInstead of using Funding Goals to unlock them, we're going to include 2 New Drink Coasters and a bunch of New Drinks baseline in all copies of RDI7.\nDrink cards and example coasters for scale.\n  Kickstarter is giving us the opportunity to release multiple variant editions of the game giving long time fans a chance to save some cardboard with our unique ECO editions and uber-fans a swanky collector's edition filled with fun extras.\nShipping: Rewards are all shipping from the United States and Canada. Unfortunately we can only offer reduced shipping to some other international regions. Backers from regions outside of the United States and Canada are responsible for their own customs and import duties.\nDrink Coasters: Last year we introduced some fun new swag to our Organized Play prize pool. Seeing as how this set is intimately tied to our beloved tavern, we decided to come up with two new ones just for this game! The Collector's Edition will include a set of 4 different ones that were previously available through Organized Play.\nShown coasters are included in the Collector's Edition.\nPromo Drinks: Our promo drinks have been wildly popular and we've been listening to your feedback. We are including 2 new Kickstarter Promos that will be in all backer rewards. The Collector's Edition will also include 2 new Promo Drinks that will be released later on in 2019 or thereafter for other promotions plus an additional 4 reprints that were never offered on Kickstarter before!\nShown promos are the reprints included in the Collector's Edition.\nMetal Turn Marker: Finally, the Collector's Edition Metal Turn Marker will be brand new, thicker and have enamel inlay. All befitting the gravity of the hallmark drink it'll represent: Dragon's Breath Ale!\nSample turn markers and the new draft courtesy of Campaign Coins. Click here to check out their other cool stuff!\n  ECO Edition: The Eco Edition is a great way to save a little money and enjoy a smaller carbon foot print. This edition comes in a much simpler lower production value box with no plastic insert. This box is designed to get your your game in one piece and be disposed of with as little hassle and impact as possible.\nThe plain white ECO RDI6 box compared to a standard RDI4 box.\n  Throughout the campaign we will be revealing each of the new characters joining the party as well as spoiling their mechanics and story.

Furthermore, our artists are human and human stuff may come up that knocks them off schedule.\n\n2. Manufacturing Delay: We have worked with our manufacturer for a very long time now. We have a great relationship with them and they work hard to get us our stuff on schedule. However, unforeseen problems can arise.\n\n3.

It is designed completely with open-market components allowing for customization of board features for specific applications. Central to this platform is a family of community supported system-on-chips.\nTritium 2GB Prototype Back Side\n* shared hardware form factor, not boot and Linux kernel compatibility \nTritium vs Raspberry Pi 3 Comparison Chart\n  Tritium can be used to tinker with electronics such as Arduino, teach programming in a variety of languages, build media centers with up to 4K video playback, create digital signage solutions, play popular retro games, establish bi-directional video calls, interface with amateur/ham radio, and many other possibilities. It is available in 512MB 32-bit 1080P, 1GB 32-bit 4K30, and 2GB 64-bit 4K30 configurations while utilizing the large existing collaborative hardware ecosystem for Raspberry Pi so  that creators to build more new and exciting products and services.\n  Once again, we're collaborating with Baylibre to get Tritium fully supported in mainline Linux. Baylibre specializes in development for Linux-based devices, including Android and Yocto operating systems. Their team of Linux Kernel maintainers and Android experts know how to work with the community to provide long-term support and bring products to market. We're excited to continue to support the impressive upstream work that they do so well.\nWhy is this project important?\nThe Libre Computer Project is a brand rather than a manufacturer. We carefully select manufacturing partners and designs to make sure that the platform as a whole will meet our requirements for open-source support and maintenance. We shy away from proprietary interfaces, vendor lock-in, and \"secret saucy\" magic because we feel strongly that those things are only redundancies hindering progress.\nWe are expanding our lineup to cover popular solutions in use today. We want to continue to simplify education, accelerate product development, and facilitate the inception of other technologies. Reducing barriers to entry is part of our mission.\nTogether with our partners, it is our goal to provide reliable and long-term supported platforms that you can depend on to create even more innovative products and services. We are open to cooperative ventures with companies willing to offer the same level of care and attention to their products throughout its lifecycle.\nWhat are the differences between the rewards?\nThere are three different boards and they share the same layout. The only difference between them are the main System-of-Chip (SoC) and the amount of RAM. They all operate at 1.0GHz.\nTritium IoT: Allwinner H2+, 32-bit, 512MB DDR3, Mali-400MP2, 1080P60, Linux\nTritium 1GB: Allwinner H3, 32-bit, 1GB DDR3, Mali-400MP2, 4K30, Android 7 Nougat, Linux\nTritium 2GB: Allwinner H5, 64-bit, 2GB DDR3, Mali-450MP4, 4K30, Android 7 Nougat, Linux\nBasic Kit Contents:\n8GB eMMC 4.x Module\nPush-Pin Heatsink with Thermal Tape\n5.1V 2.5A MicroUSB Power Supply\nActive Cooling Media Center PC Case\nPush-Pin Heatsink with Thermal Tape\n  LoveRPi Active Cooling Media Center PC Case\n   Complete Kit Contents:\nBasic Kit\nLarger eMMC Module\nHDMI Cable\nMicroSD Card\nGenBasic Omni Remote Air Mouse Keyboard and Touchpad\nGenBasic Omni Remote Air Mouse Keyboard and Touchpad\nWhat technologies does it use?\nAllwinner's H2+/H3/H5 series of chips are built on the 40nm fabrication process just like the system-on-chips used in Raspberry Pi 3. The H2+ forms the basis of the IoT model and H3 SoC offer higher HDMI solution, slightly better media support, and faster IO interfaces but utilizes slightly slower and older ARM Cortex-A7 core designs. The Allwinner H5 SoC in the 2GB board offers 64-bit capabilities just like the Raspberry Pi 3's BCM2837 and cryptographic acceleration.\nWhat about software support?\nLinux mainline is very active due the contribution of the linux-sunxi community and Free Electrons. Linux-based distros such as Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and Armbian are readily available for Allwinner Hx. Our platform extend a greater lead on Android. We will provide extensive software support for this platform alongside the existing open source community. Please read the software section further down for more information.\nWhat about the proprietary ARM Mali-400/450 GPU?\nThe ARM Mali-4xx series of 3D accelerators is among the most popular 3D GPU IP due to its age, cost, and software support, albeit proprietary in nature. ARM inherited most of the design from its Norwegian acquisition of Falanx Microsystems but never open sourced the software IP. The 3D GPU utilizes compiled binary firmware tailored to specific SoCs. The GPU does not feature a 2D display engine and the binary must be tied into different display engines via customizations from the SoC vendor. The firmware connects to a passthrough kernel driver and this is the mechanism of 3D enablement for our board in our operating system images.\nInitiatives to develop an open source driver never achieve the critical mass to provide resources to drive adoption by the community like with freedrino and other drivers. Due to the number of deployments with this 3D GPU series, we know that having this would open new possibilities. We really want this to happen and have contributed resources to this effort. We will continue contribute resources when presented the opportunity to affect meaningful progress on this front.\nWhat is \"libre\" about it?\nLibre implies having the freedom to do as you wish. In the software world, libre means having the source code with a license permissive of changes. In the hardware world, libre means having the the ability to make and modify the hardware. Libre should not be confused with gratis. We are designing libre hardware while promoting libre software. The components we use are open-market items. Unlike the Raspberry Pi 3, there are no exclusive sold components that prevent you from designing, customizing, or improving on your own version of this board.\nTritium's SoCs upstream has been maintained by the linux-sunxi community and they have made great progress on the H2+, H3, and H5 SoCs with most of the work already upstreamed in Linux 4.12. The Tritium board device trees will be upstreamed as well.\nHow does it compare to other boards?\nBeing a cost-effective product, it compares favorably to the Raspberry Pi 3 in applications where price, IO performance, and fewer blobs are critical factors. While it does not perform as well as our AML-S905X-CC platform that was Kickstarted a few months ago, it does offer a CMOS camera interface for simple camera and vision applications. The four USB 2.0 ports, ethernet interface, MicroSD card slot, and eMMC interface all have independent bandwidth for maximum IO performance.\nCan I use this in commercial applications?\nThe board can utilize a lot of existing hardware infrastructure already in place since it shares its form factor with the Raspberry Pi 3. Software tweaks are definitely needed to port existing projects to this platform.\nThe boards can be ordered with header pins either on the top or on the bottom for more flexibility and integration with carrier boards. They can be customized to use any of the 3 SoCs and anywhere from between 256MB to 2GB of DDR3 RAM. Customization requests start at 500 units depending on the changes needed or complexity.\nWill it run existing software?\nDepending on the board, you can run ARMv8 (2GB Board only), ARMv7, ARMv6 compiled code compiled on Linux. However, it requires a different boot loader and kernel to be installed on the MicroSD card for existing Raspberry Pi images to be bootable. We will provide tooling on Github to do this. If the software on the image is tailored to the features of a specific board, software work will need to be done to utilize the features of this board instead.\nAndroid based on Android 7 Nougat has been running on the 1GB H3 and 2GB H5 boards via eMMC and MicroSD card. The latest mainline Linux together with a device tree will work on this board. Some features of the board are still not in mainline per the linux-sunxi mainlining page. We hope to have the dts for all three boards in mainline by Linux 4.16.\nWill it be compatible with existing add-ons?\nTritium has a 40 pin GPIO header that maintains as much compatibility as possible with the existing standard set forth by the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B. The placement on the header of I2C, SPI, PWM, UART, 5V, 3.3V, and GPIO are equivalent. Raspberry Pi ecosystem has quite a few years of support from numerous vendors and we can only play catch-up at this point. Most Raspberry Pi HATs can be supported by the hardware but the software bits to get them working on this board is simply not there yet.\nWhy did you not add onboard WiFi or Bluetooth?\nThe certification process for single board computers with radios is incredibly painful and long. We want to make this product as convenient as possible to procure in any country so we refrained from adding radio components. Additionally, the performance of onboard radios are generally poor while USB dongles are cheap, certified in many countries, and offer better performance.\nWe recommend using USB or carrier boards and mezzanines to add functionality to the base hardware. This reduces design and certification cost on both our side and customer side.\nHow far along is this project?\nThe product design, initial software support, and testing have been completed by our internal team. Your contributions will be used towards the manufacturing and distribution of the boards.\nWe will be providing the following:\nSchematic Diagram\nAndroid 7 Nougat for eMMC and MicroSD card\nUbuntu 16.04 Linux\nCan I get multiple rewards?\nFrom our previous experience with Kickstarter, it is easier for us logistically if there is only one reward per person.

What are we all about?\nThere is a resurgence of women empowerment happening right now and we at andieanderin want to support and contribute to this momentous social conversation. \nAnd what better way to do so than to bring back the pussybow or what we are calling \u2018neckties\u2019 - made popular during the rising power of women in the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s.\n'FLOTUS with the MOSTUS' women necktie inspired by the fabulous Michelle Obama\nWe create neckties for women and girls that are designed to reflect the genius behind some of the most influential women from the past and present. Our hope is that these thoughtfully crafted neckties can transform any ensemble and give the person wearing it a sense of superpower - similar to the women the neckties were designed to emulate. \nOur first collection consists of seven neckties representing the fabulousness of Beyonce, Frida, Hillary Clinton, Malala Yousafzai, Michelle Obama, Mother Teresa, and Oprah.\n'Queen of Pop' inspired by the one-and-only Beyonce\nThe women we are celebrating are truly inspiring. And to really paint a picture of their influence, each necktie will also come with a storyboard that illustrates the accomplishments of these women.\ncollection of andieanderin storyboards that accompany their respective necktie\nWe are also passionate about giving back. With each necktie sale, andieanderin will donate a portion of the proceeds to an organization that is supporting the empowerment of women and girls, starting with the amazing Step Up charity organization. \n'The Brave One' designed after the inspirational Malala Yousafzai\n  'The Hilz' necktie inspired by Hillary Clinton\nPussybow blouses are certainly a current trend, but with the andieanderin necktie, you aren\u2019t stuck wearing it with just a blouse, you can mix and match with any outfit while also repping your inner badass. There is nothing stopping you from wearing the necktie with a hoodie - trust us, we\u2019ve done it :)\n    andieanderin neckties are a versatile statement piece for any outfit\n Why are we raising money through Kickstarter? \nWe are a friend-duo that are pooling our resources to make our first necktie collection come to life, but we need a little assistance to see it to the finish line and tied around the necks of fabulous women and girls across the US. \nWe are also dedicated to using premium materials and producing our neckties in the USA. With this comes some additional material and production cost, but we believe we can\u2019t represent these amazing women on the cheap! We also don\u2019t want to stop after just one collection! \nThere are so many fabulous women to celebrate and we hope to create a large library of neckties that represent a highly diverse group of women. \nAnd if we are totally honest, our dream of dreams is to have an exhibit in a museum showcasing hundreds of our neckties. But that is for another Kickstarter campaign\u2026unless Anna Wintour comes calling for a women empowerment Met exhibit and needs some neckties ;)\n  The 'Queen of Media' necktie is designed after Oprah\nWhy we need funding: \nWe need the funding to complete the production of our first necktie collection as well as to help in the design and execution of our second collection.\nOur second collection will represent another group of amazing women and we would love to partner with female guest artists on textile design and storyboard illustrations to help bring it to life.\nWe need funding to scale the project. Our first collection will be offered in limited quantities because we are currently working in small production batches, which drives up our costs. However we hope to grow with our second collection and having additional funds in advance of production will help us secure larger quantities at lower cost. We also want to work to reduce our production and material costs so we can donate a larger portion of proceeds to charitable organizations.\nWe also need to reach more people to grow the project. Hiring marketers and dedicating funding to advertising will be important in helping us grow our brand organically versus immediately partnering with retailers.\n'The Saint Teresa' designed after Mother Teresa\nWho\u2019s featured in our first collection: \nNecktie: \u201cQueen of Pop\u201d\nBeyonce Knowles-Carter aka \u2018Sasha Fierce\u2019 aka \u2018Queen\u2019 is a pop culture force that will likely create 100 more internet-breaking headlines before we can even go to print, simply by getting insta-dressed in the morning. And she hasn\u2019t been dubbed \u201cQueen Bey\u201d for nothing. Beyonc\u00e9 has 20 Grammys to her name for her solo career alone and her Lemonade album from 2016 is one for the history books.\nNecktie: \u201cThe Mexican Icon\u201d\nFrida Kahlo is a woman who endured more than your fair share of tragedies. And she took those tragedies and made them into some of the most provocative paintings the world has seen.\nNecktie: \u201cThe Hilz\u201d\nHillary Clinton...oh Hillary...in short, she started a movement and not just for pantsuits (which look great with a necktie, \u2018wink\u2019). Not only is Hillary Clinton America\u2019s original \u201cnasty woman,\u201d she is also America\u2019s first woman in history to top a majority party presidential ticket.\nNecktie: \u201cThe Brave One\u201d\nMalala Yousafzai. If Superwoman had a mission to bring education to all the children of the world, that would be Malala Yousafzai. She is an astoundingly strong and passionate young woman who started this fight at an age when most kids are celebrating their elementary school graduation.\nNecktie: \u201cFLOTUS with the MOSTUS\u201d\nMichelle Obama. What is there not to love about Mrs. Michelle Obama? A gutsy, smart, bold and determined woman equal to her husband (ahem, the former president), she is a true symbol of femininity and strength.\nNecktie: \u201cThe Saint Teresa\u201d\nMother Teresa is a saint amongst the saints.

In this dark, medieval universe, kings plot for the throne of France, and on the battlefield their heroic knights clash with foes both real and legendary.\nFor more than a century, from 1337 to 1453, the fields of France rang to the sound of constant warfare. The Hundred Years\u2019 War is one of the longest wars ever fought and is the source of many of our collective ideas about heroic knights of old. It was also a time of myths and legends, and a fervent faith in the literal truth of the doctrine of Holy Mother Church. It is this world of strife and faith that this game recreates.\nIn Time of Legends: Joan of Arc, all the creatures that the medieval people thought were real, are real. Whether they are represented on tapestries, in stained glass windows, or in illuminated manuscripts, we take them at their word. It is this dark and epic universe that you will explore in the game\u2019s many scenarios. Some are historical, with no taint of the whispered legends of strange creatures. Others are replete with the supernatural or (saints preserve us) demonic.\nYou are free to control the army of miniatures that represent your heroes, knights and peasants as you wish in order to achieve your goals. You will decide who moves and where; whether your forces explore, pray, converse with locals, or simply charge into battle. But before we get to the field of glory, you must first choose your side.\nDownload the Beta Rulebook here !  \n  All of these unlocked stretch goals are added FREE to every Maiden pledge, and every copy of the core box you pledge for.\n                                Joan Of Arc, Bertrand Du Guesclin, La Hire, Gilles de Rais & Jean de Dunois (miniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted)\n The French have a very large army whose leaders follow the code of chivalry to the letter. These noble knights form the main striking force of the army, with their infantry taking a subservient role. The French employ few archers, but do hire efficient crossbowmen to fight alongside their men-at-arms. All these warriors fight on behalf of the King of France, who sees the war as a chance to reclaim lands lost to the English under earlier monarchs.\nThe Black Prince, Falstaff, John Talbot, John Chandos & John of Lancaster (miniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted)\nThe English king considers himself the legitimate heir to the throne of France, and there is some truth in this. In fact, he only failed to gain the crown because the French changed the rule of royal succession to stop him.\nThe English army, though considerably less numerous than the French, are formidable combatants, who often have the best strategists. Their longbowmen wreak havoc on the battlefield, and have repeatedly bested the cream of French chivalry in battle. This is a slight that the French knights are determined to avenge.\nArchangel Gabriel, the Unicorn & Angel (miniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted)\nThe army of God is made up of powerful, heavenly beings like the angels and archangels. They fight their righteous battles alongside the lesser creatures of God, and the weary mortals who struggle with sin, but are devoted to their creator.\nThe Holy Army can be played independently, or allied with the French, or the English.\nThe Witch, the Werewolf & the Ghost Warrior (miniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted)\nThe Devil\u2019s army is made up of all sorts of foul creatures: werewolves, demons, skeletons, dragons, witches, and many more. Countless fallen mortals march alongside this monstrous host, having cast aside their God and sold their souls for mere wealth or power. It is rumoured that in this dark time, when the End of Days has never seemed so close, even the Devil himself may make an appearance...\nThe Unholy Army can be played independently, or allied with the French, or the English.\n All of these unlocked stretch goals are added FREE to every Maiden pledge, and every copy of the core box you pledge for.\nTime of Legends: Joan of Arc can be played in two different modes: scenario or battle.\nIn the scenario mode, you choose a scenario from the many options offered in the core box and elsewhere. The key feature of a scenario is that it sets a scene and describes a situation, then lets you finish the story by playing a game. A scenario can be anything from a select group of heroes investigating dire rumours of witchcraft, to a sudden ambush featuring dozens of soldiers on either side.\nIn the battle mode, you fight your opponent using an army of your choice. The key feature of battle mode is that both players choose their own forces \u2013 nothing is pre-set. Once you have constructed your army following the simple rules, you fight a battle, with victory depending on the objectives chosen.\nThe cross of the hanged wolf Scenario (3D Demo Board for convention - Not for sale).\n   All pledge levels will be available in both English and French. You\u2019ll be able to choose the language during the pledge manager phase, after the campaign.\nTous les niveaux de souscriptions seront disponibles en fran\u00e7ais et en anglais. Vous pourrez choisir votre langue lors de la phase de pledge manager \u00e0 l\u2019issue de la campagne.\nThis campaign will be presented in both English and French wherever possible. This does mean a lot more work for us, and we may sometimes need a little time to catch up with translations. Please bear with us.\nThe French version of this page is here.\n   The Maiden Pledge, with more than 230 miniatures plus all unlocked stretch goals and 12 scenarios that each have a strong replayability, includes everything you need to play for a very, very long time. It is however possible to explore new horizons with the optional buys.\nYou can buy Optional Buys separately with the Companion in Arms Pledge, if you are not interested in the rest of the range.\nOr you can buy them in addition to your Maiden Pledge if you want to play them as we've designed them.\nIf you\u2019re interested in purchasing any optional buy, just click the \u00ab Manage your Pledge \u00bb button on the Time of Legends: Joan of Arc Kickstarter page, and add to your current pledge level the amount of the items that you\u2019d like to get in the pledge manager. You don\u2019t have to specify what you want at this stage, we\u2019ll sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed, when we send you our pledge manager.\n BUNDLES ADD-ONS\nLEGENDARY ADD-ON\n   MAJESTIC ADD-ON\n    MYTHIC ADD-ON\n   HEROIC ADD-ON\n  Click here to find more about this add-on.\nJOAN OF ARC ROLEPLAYING GAME\nClick here to find more about this add-on\nVILLAGE PACK \n Click here to find more about this add-on.\nPLUNDER\n COMPENDIUM\nClick here to find more about this add-on.\nSIEGE\n  Click here to find more about this add-on.\nARS NOVA\n Click here to find more about this add-on.\nLEGENDARY BATTLES\nClick here to find more about this add-on.\nUNLEASH HELL\n Click to find out more about this add-on.\nLEGENDARY DRAGON\nThe Legendary Dragon is the biggest figure in the game and the biggest playable figure in boardgame history.

Mythic Games had pictures of hard plastic miniatures painted up, and they looked incredible.\u201d\n Techraptor at Gen Con 2017\n\u201cWithout a doubt, hands-down, my big giant experience at (GenCon) was Time of Legends: Joan of Arc. An amazing Euro minis game. The way you activate the models is extremely innovative. It was awesome, the most fun of any game I played in the vendor hall.\u201d\nD6 Generation at Gen Con 2017\n\u201cMythic Games is no slouch when it comes to producing excellent gaming experiences and they\u2019re ready to take everyone back in time with their latest game, Time of Legends: Joan of Arc. Words really cannot do the pieces justice.\u201d\nFresh Mana\n\u201csi le c\u0153ur est \u00e0 l\u2019affrontement, le c\u00f4t\u00e9 narratif suinte de toutes parts, envahit le gameplay pour proposer une exp\u00e9rience vibrante et forte, et donner des options significativement vari\u00e9es au joueur.\u201d\n\u201cIf the heart of the game is in confrontation, the narrative oozes in from all sides, and infuses the gameplay to provide a strong, vibrant experience that provides the players with significantly different options.\u201d\n VIDEOS IN ENGLISH\n             VIDEOS EN FRANCAIS\n            Joan of Arc uses a different scale from what is usually offered on Kickstarter, the Legendary Scale. This smaller but extremely accurate and detailed scale offers many advantages:\n- You can play on a normal sized table, and yet have a large area to cover and a wide variety of terrain types;\n- You can play, if desired, with a very large number of figures on each side; We can include complete and numerous 3D buildings: church, houses, trees, rocks, etc.\n- You can enjoy a dramatically impressive size difference between humans and creatures. Thus, our giants and monsters are really enormous... And our dragon has the actual size that this legendary monster should have.\nSize comparison : Odysseus (from Mythic Battles:Pantheon), Gilles de Rais, Crossbowmen & Angel.\nThe Time of Legends: Joan of Arc miniatures fall into three categories:\nHeroes\nJoan of Arc\nThese are figures known from the medieval period. They possess powers and can level up during an adventure or a battle.\nTroops \nHalberdiers\nThese are the basic units of armies. They are set in groups of 3 infantry models, 2 cavalry models, or 1 single model for exceptionally powerful beings such as angels, demons or dragons. They do not level up, but may possess powers.\nCharacters \nBishop\nThey represent professional bodies of medieval society: blacksmith, priest, merchant, diviner, shepherd, etc. They are always set in 1 single model and bring special powers to their allies, but can rarely fight and can not level up. They are neutral at first, and rally those who enter their zone. Some of them are called Protagonists and have a Discussion Deck. Only a Hero or a Character can discuss with a Protagonist.\nGog and Magog \n     Gog and Magog are two giants offered exclusively to all backers who have taken at least one Maiden Pledge (the Companion in Arms does not qualify), only during the time of this 31 days campaign. These \"Super Exclusive\" figures will only be available during the Kickstarter campaign, to thank the backers who supported us from the start. They will not be available during the Late Pledge, or during the Pledge Manager if you only pledged for less than a Maiden Pledge during the Kickstarter campaign, they will not be given or sold at convention or event.\nThese two terrifying heralds of the Apocalypse, foretellers of chaos and the end of time, possess devastating power on the battlefield.\nGog is poured into satanic magic, while the powerful Magog is a real killing machine. You will be able to play Gog and Magog in one of the proposed scenarios as well as in Battle mode, they are part of the Unholy Army.\nTo know more about God and Magog, read this update\n3D Scenery\nThe game offers a large number of buildings and elements of 3D terrain. They are not just eye candy, in fact they all have a real gameplay. Thus, they count in the occupation of the play areas, offering various bonuses/penalties and opening new scenaristic options. For example, praying in a church gives more Myth points than praying elsewhere and the presence of trees in a forest area allows the defender to roll a defence dice against ranged attacks. Buildings can be visited, searched, and offer defensive bonuses. The buildings are laid on cardboard floor plans. When miniatures penetrate inside a building, the building is temporarily removed to place the minis on the floor plans. When all the minis leave, the building is put back on the board to indicate that it is unoccupied.\nTerrain Tiles\nJoan of Arc is played on modular tiles, composed of large Hexagons divided into 1, 2 or 3 areas. Each area is a type of terrain (Forest, Plain, Field, Marsh, Village, etc.) that can accommodate elements of terrain and of course, miniatures!\nAn area taking up the whole hexagon can contain 8 elements (bases of miniatures or terrain elements).\nThis area is saturated, it contains 8 elements\nAn area taking a half hexagon can contain 6 elements.\nAn area taking one third of a hexagon can contain 4 elements\nThis area is saturated, the Tarasque counts as 4 elements.\nBattle Dashboard\nThe Battle Dashboard combines all the elements of the current game that are common to all players: available resources for the turn, Doom dice, river cards. You also lay down the miniatures that were put out of combat after a fight. These figures will return to the battlefield if the Doom dice is favorable to them... or leave it definitively to join the cemetery if fate falls on them!\nPlayer Dashboards\n Each player has their own dashboard that allows them to manage their resources: activation cubes, experience tokens and myth tokens. In his turn, the player spends them to activate his units (cubes), to pay the cost of a Myth or Tactic card he wants to play (tokens Myth/Tactic) or the leveling cost of the hero he wants to level up (Experience tokens). At the end of his turn, the player may decide to keep his resources in the spaces provided for this purpose.\nSpecial Dice\nDuring combat, the players roll dice of different colours, in attack and defence.\nWhite engravings mean that these dice can kill\nBlack engravings mean that these dice are disruptive\nRed dice are the most offensive dice.\nBlack dice are the most defensive dice.\nYellow dice are the dice of the special effects.\nWhite dice are the most balanced dice.\nCards\nEach unit of miniatures has its own card, placed on the table in front of the player so that he can consult at a glance its characteristics. Heroes can level up during the game by spending experience points.\nRules\nWe will be uploading a pdf of the rulebook soon.\n The European Union, USA, Canada and Australia zones will be \u201cShipping Friendly\u201d: Backers from these countries will not suffer  import taxes.\nBased on our Mythic Battles: Pantheon experience, we will be charging shipping once the Kickstarter is over, based on the actual costs. We will collect the information via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. We will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in France (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), USA (The USA and the rest of the world), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers). The following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game Joan of Arc package that is roughly the same weight as Mythic Battles: Pantheon (5.25kg weight for core box + SG). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $25-$30 to most states. \nCANADA: $30-$35 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $100 to most countries. \nASIA: $40 to China and Hong Kong. $50 to most other countries. \nOCEANIA: $30 to Australia. $65 to New Zealand.\nEUROPE: $25-$30 to France. $25-$35 to most other countries. \nREST OF THE WORLD: $105.\nWe will do our utmost to ensure that your products arrive on time, before the public release of the game. However, we are aware that some problems concerning shipping and production may arise that are outside of our sphere of influence. The immense majority of backers will receive their game before the general release, but there are specific locations that might take much longer to get delivered, so we cannot guarantee that a 100% of our backers will receive their copy of the game before the general release, there might be a few of them who won\u2019t. We can, at least, guarantee that you will be benefitting from a great discount and many exclusive Kickstarter only features. The commercial version of the game will include a lot less material than the KS one. If these special contents and prices are not sufficient when compared to the risk of not being delivered on time, then we suggest that you do not participate in this crowdfunding campaign and acquire the game when it is released in shops.\nWHO WORKED ON THE PROJECT?\nFrom left to right: Irek Zielinski, Olivier Thill, Beno\u00eet Vogt, Jake Thornton, Leonidas Vesperini, David Rakoto, Christophe Madura, St\u00e9phane Gantiez, Erwann Le Torrivellec\n  Pascal Bernard, author of the game, in front of the \"Joan of Arc house\" in Orl\u00e9ans, the house in which Joan spent the night during the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans.\nOn top of the people from Mythic Games, a huge team of passionate professionals has worked on Joan of Arc.

EXTRA METAVIRA MINI CAMPAIGN ADDED!\n   Jagged Alliance: The Boardgame is a rich and variable co-operative tactical combat game true to the game\u2019s digital predecessor with 999+ minutes of replayable campaign and extra scenarios. Take the role of your favorite Jagged Alliance mercenaries and fight the armies of an evil dictator to free the nation of Arulco from oppression. JA:TBG is full of tough choices, always keeping you and your team on the edge of victory or defeat.\nIn JA:TBG you encounter a succession of challenging scenarios with a variety of goals you need to accomplish, taking your hard earned equipment and experience with you into each successive scenario. Ultimately you will face the tyrant Deidranna herself (or one of the other dictators in the game), who is ruling Arulco with an iron fist, and try to defeat her once and for all.\nJA:TBG features an inbuilt risk-reward system at every level of game-play, forcing players to make fateful decision with every move. They can manage the amount of actions and how good a chance for success they have by spending Stamina - however any Wounds are also deducted from the same pool, so the more they exhaust their mercs, the more they risk being taken out by the opposition. Players will decide who goes first, when and which sectors to liberate, whether to spend hard-won funds on hiring new merc allies, black-market weaponry or bribing enemy officers to keep escalation low, thus preventing counter-attacks. Jagged Alliance always keeps you at the edge providing the immense satisfaction of a hard-won victory.\nEvery playthrough is different thanks to the many variations in the game setup. From choosing a different dictator, who will change the conditions of a game, to the variable encounter and enemy set-ups or the 100+ cards of weapons, allies and gear, you will never play the same game twice.\nWhat's more: With the modular sectors and variable set-ups, you can create your own scenario, so you are basically getting a tool set to make your own campaigns and missions with the game!\nAt the heart of every Jagged Alliance game are the mercs, who have their own skills and stats and can be individually equipped with weapons, armor and gear. They will progress throughout the game and collect other beloved JA characters as allies to help them in and out of combat.\nApart from kicking Redshirt ass, mercs can repair damaged equipment, train rebel troops to protect liberated sectors, heal injuries and gather experience. Each merc will be an individually sculpted miniature and more mercs will be added via stretch goals and OUR BACKERS WILL DECIDE WHICH MERCS TO ADD TO THE ROSTER!\nOn a strategic level you will have to deal with Deidranna\u2019s (or one of the alternate dictators available in the game) ever escalating counter-attacks and special abilities. Dictators are the nefarious powers behind every game and can change the rules and conditions for scenarios, and bring their own set of events and extra missions.\nPlayers will have to decide whether to risk an increasing escalation that brings stronger counterattacks and more dangerous missions but higher rewards, or try to keep escalation in check and get to their goals faster.\nAlongside each dictator are their trusted Lieutenants, who will make player's lives even more difficult. Lieutenants are tough to overcome and will require players to devise special tactics. Finally facing (and hopefully beating) the dictator in the game is the high point of every campaign!\nMissions are enemy schemes influencing the scenario from outside the currently contested region and play a vital strategic role, as they can modify enemy strength, recovery and mechanics in the game. Players will need to decide whether to split forces to resolve them or focus on the regional map progression and deal with the conditions set by the active missions.\nMissions can range from helping wounded in a village, hijacking the local radio station or capturing a well-guarded convoy. As always, the risks and rewards need to be considered carefully. \nEnemies in the game come in different flavors and sizes, from the base Redshirt grunts to elusive snipers or deadly MG teams, each with their unique attack patterns and abilities. As the game progresses, these enemies get replaced with elite versions and become more dangerous. There is always the chance for a random bloodcat popping up in your sector!\nRebel intelligence provides some information about how guarded each sector is, but you never know exactly whom you will be facing. Outnumbered and often outgunned you need your wits, skills and a plethora of weapons to overcome the opposition's troops.\nEach scenario represents a contested region made of sectors, divided into areas, that need to be liberated and may feature a unique objective as well. Capturing strategic targets will make your life easier, with mines that produce funds or villages that allow you to recruit workers and train militia. With 40 different sector maps there is always something new to discover.\nTerrain types in an area influence enemy and mercenary abilities, adding to the challenge further. Hide in lush jungles or go close-combat in urban areas! With its modular map tile system, wide range of scenarios and flexible progression that you can save from one game to the next, JA:TBG allows for brief skirmish games or 666+ minutes of ongoing campaign play.\nAlso - with 20+ double sided sector maps, random cards and variable enemy set-ups, you hold all the tools in your hand to create your own scenarios and we will publish the best user generated content as a scenario sheet on our website. You can build your own campaign or skirmish scenario and we will do community challenges from time to time to build scenarios based on specific premises. Endless challenges await!\nJA:TBG is a truly co-operative game playable solo or with up to 4 players, where you need to coordinate your team's efforts and skills to the best of your ability to free Arulco...or die trying.\nThe game will come with printed versions of the rules and scenario booklets in English and pdf versions in German, French and Polish. Cards only have limited text and should be easy to understand.\nMinis will have 27-30mm (Tank not to scale)\n  Something is stirring below...and it's on you to keep it down.\nUnderground! adds a new threat to the game: the infamous JA2 Crepitus creatures, including 3 new enemy types (adolescent, male and female Crepitus) and the terrifying Crepitus Queen as a Dictator with new event cards and mechanics. Take them up in new scenarios or incorporate them in you base campaign.\nDescend into new sectors, such as mineshafts and secret research facilities, that host new dangers and top secret tech-inventions like the Rocket Rifle and lasers.\nNew rules for lighting can be integrated into the base game, bringing darkness and night-vision equipment to Arulco!\n  The bucket does not stop here: If we reach the upcoming stretch goals, we will be able to get you even MORE gameplay for your greenbacks! Spread the word and help us to make YOUR game better, snapperheads!\n     Want to help even more? If we manage to reach these nifty social stretch goals we will make the game even more attractive by adding the below to your game.\nLIKE US ON FACEBOOK!\nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR BLOG!\nFOLLOW US ON TWITTER!\n    Our friends at Orkenspalter TV were nice enough to play through an early prototype of the game (with hand-made dice and lego miniatures to boot), so you can watch a sample play session. Be advised that rules will still change (also: we do not include hand-crafted dice by Jan)!\nDEATH RULES HAVE CHANGED FROM VIDEO!\nEnglish Session\n \nGerman Session\n   Games will come with German, French and Polish rules as pdf \n  Shipping will be charged after the Kickstarter finishes based on actual costs incurred to ship and is collected via our pledge manager system. This allows us to charge fairly for all backers and avoid a 'one size fits all' mentality to shipping.  \nWe expect shipping cost to range between 10 to 20 \u20ac/USD for the base game and 16 to 25 for the base game plus add-on. \nWe will ship your pledges to several hubs around the world at our cost. Your pledge will arrive via one of the following hubs:   \nUnited Kingdom (UK and Rest of the World backers) \nUSA (US backers)  \nCanada (Canada backers)   \nGermany (EU backers)   \nChina (Asia Pacific backers)   \nAustralia (Australia and New Zealand backers)    \nAny pledges confirmed after our pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the closest usable hub at a later date and will likely incur increased shipping costs.  We will update you on estimated shipping boxes once we have the final box layout and dimensions sorted. All shipping will be done by carefully selected shipping partners to minimize any chance of damage to the shipment! \nWe are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have playtested this for 100+ hours and will continue to do so during the next months as we gather feedback. So the game will change a little still, which may affect our delivery schedule.\n\nWe also invite our backers to provide feedback on the current game version, so this may also change the exact number and types of components that will make it into the final game.\n\nWe have already worked closely with manufacturers and have successfully shipped other kickstarters outside our current company, but as always delays in manufacturing and shipping may occur.\n\nWe are fully aware of potential delays that may happen with products that are produced in China, the common ones being delays in production, shipping, and customs. Due to the global logistics involved in shipping, some regions may receive their pledges sooner than others.\n\nREFUND GUARANTEE\nWe have prepared as much as possible with our production for a successful Kickstarter; however, we will refund pledges in the amount we received (so after fees) if for some unforeseen reason the game cannot be delivered at all.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Spotter", "descp": "1,20 USD\nSupport the campaign with your goodwill and keep an eye on things.

Then cunningly manipulate your dice in challenging combat with dangerous monsters. \n  In this strategic dice placement game, you compete with your fellow players to venture out of the Citadel, the last bastion against marauding Monsters. You will fight Monsters in the Lands they have occupied, hopefully winning them back for the crown. \n        The LEADER pledge is for the base game that will be available in retail, plus all the nice stretch goals, most of them KS exclusive, we will hopefully be able to unlock during the campaign. It only excludes the stretch goals marked as MONSTER stretch goals.\n  Want to go in for a real treat? With the MONSTER pledge, you will get deluxe components on top of everything you get in the LEADER pledge, and MONSTER stretch goals that add further deluxe components. Please see here for a look at the gorgeous printed wooden tokens.\n                                                                            Monster Lands is a game of fame, a game of bravery and wits in which you prepare yourself to fight monsters that have overrun the Kingdom of Queen Gimelda.   \n This Euro-style dice placement game combines resource management and battle action, it puts you in the role of the leader of a small clan of brave warriors which you will try to guide to victory by amassing glory and reputation.  \n     For those of you who speak Spanish:\n For the French-speaking mercenaries:\nThe game is played over a maximum of 6 rounds, each divided into 4 phases  \n1) Dice Pool Generation  \n2) Deployment  \n3) Adventure  \n4) Clean-up  \n  At the beginning of the game, dreadful monsters are holding the Queen\u2019s lands ransom and you are commissioned to fight them and free the Lands.  \n  Your Clan Progress Track is the base for your actions, here you record your glory and reputation. In the Dice Pool Generation phase you collect dice from the track and all your mercenaries, these are your tools to prosper.  \n  You will use your dice to take actions using a \u201cworker-placement\u201d mechanic. In the Citadel, your dice allow you to improve your clan, acquiring traps, shields, potions, venoms, mercenaries, and more. The timing of your dice placement and the type of dice you use affects both yourself and other players.  \n  All of the mercenaries, resources, and items you acquire go back to your clan base, and once you feel equipped enough, you go out to the wilderness and face the monsters.  \n  Outside the Citadel, your dice become battle tools. You roll them in missions and battles, aiming to surpass target values. Careful, though, the choice of position in the battle is strategic, you compete with other players to take down the monsters or free the lands.  \n  You will have many opportunities to manipulate your dice results and increase your chance of success, using a multitude of items and abilities. You cannot simply hope for lucky rolls to snatch the crown, you will need to carefully manage your resources and do some proper planning to be successful.  \n If you capture or eliminate a monster or re-conquer a land, you will reap substantial rewards in form of glory and money. Use them to improve your clan even more. At the end of the game, the crown is handed to the clan with most Victory Points, which are generated by glory, reputation and a few more aspects which enrich the game even further.   \n  MONSTER LANDS will come with a printed English rulebook by default, but you can also choose to receive it in either Spanish, French, or German. All these core languages will also be available as downloadable PDF.\n                We can proudly tell you that we have worked the rules with a professional board game rules editor, a big THANK YOU to Paul Grogan from GAMING RULES! Investing money into a professionally edited rulebook early gives you the reassurance that you will have no difficulties learning the game. \nOn top, we also got valuable input from Richard Ham (RAHDO RUNS THROUGH) to fine-tune and perfect the flow.

They are all handmade by the fantastically creative glass artist Jenefer Ham in Malta, all unique, all lovingly shaped into these cute bubbly forms by melting colored glass rods with a 2500\u00baC/1400\u00baF flame torch. They replace the 1st player marker and although you only need one of them for the game, you may want to go for the full collection of four colors, one for each Affinity featured in the game, Jungle, Fire, Water, and Air.\n Pledge 32 \u20ac for a monster with a color of your choice or 100 \u20ac for the set of all four colors. The glass monsters will come safely snuggled in a bag with a note from Jenefer, and will be posted certified directly from Malta in April 2018, postage for this item already included in the add-on price. \n       This is Second Gate Games\u2019 second Kickstarter project, but the first we will do as an independent publisher. We are extremely excited and motivated! \nHaving learned from our partner CMON in the launch of B-Sieged, a game we authored, we now look forward to applying these learnings and \u201cdrown you with stretch-goals\u201d ;) \n But even more important than the campaign itself is the desire to provide you with a game that is both fun to play and beautiful to behold. \n Second Gate Games as publisher does not only release its own games like Monster Lands, but has also successfully started to publish licensed games of other authors, like Cat Box and Kitty Paw. Why is this important? Because it gives you reassurance that the company is not a one-off stunt, we are here to stay, with a long-term commitment. \n The people behind Second Gate Games: \n    Quite simply, because we couldn\u2019t do this without Kickstarter. As a new kid on the block in the board game publishing industry, we do not have the funds to finance a full production nor the means to gauge demand.\n  Kickstarter is a great tool for us as a company, but is also good news for you as a backer. We are creating Kickstarter exclusive stretch-goals and a Monster pledge level that would never have been possible in a retail environment.\n    The USA, the UK, the European Union, Canada and Australia will all be \u201cFriendly Shipping\u201d. This means we will mass import the product into these regions and handle and pay all the import taxes, you won\u2019t have to incur additional cost.\nThe games will be produced in China by LongPack Games, an experienced board game manufacturer with a proven track record. Prototype quality has been outstanding. For the overseas freight, we are working with global forwarding agents that allow visibility of the shipment at any time, as they are on their way to the various distribution centers. We will be using established fulfillment companies like Ship Naked, Quartermaster Logistic, VFI, Aetherworks, Happyshops, and others, specialized and experienced in the fulfillment of Kickstarter projects, to cover the distance from distribution centers to your home. \nAll steps included, we calculate the product should arrive at your home end of September 2018. [EDIT from Nov. 2: we have adjusted the expected delivery time to end of SEPTEMBER 2018, in order to include the Heavy Weapons and 5p expansion set. Unfortunately, we cannot edit this information in the original pledge boxes]\nShipping will be paid AFTER THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN, during the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d phase, which we will do with the help of Backerkit, the leading Pledge Manager platform. Above you will find the shipping cost you will have to expect per region. In the case of single unit pledges, these are maximum prices.\nWe say \u201cmaximum\u201d because these prices may go down further, but never up. Shipping prices fluctuate, but our pledge to you is that, for single unit shipments, we cover any potential additional cost beyond these shipping quotes, which are already subsidized by about 4\u20ac. And what\u2019s even better: the more volume we ship, the better we can streamline and optimize shipping, and we want to give back to the community by reducing shipping cost further.\n              ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe creation process for a board game is a complex enterprise, especially for a game like ours with hundreds of components: design adjustments, approval processes, pre-production samples, printing & assembling, freight shipping, handling in logistic centers and finally the last shipment to your door. If anything goes wrong or isn\u2019t perfectly right, there is a risk of delay at any of those steps. This is a simple reality that you as backer need to be aware of. If anything did indeed go awry, we would communicate this to you openly.\n \nHowever, we feel that we are well prepared for a good fulfillment process and minimize the risk of delay, for the following reasons:\n \n1. We have done about 95% of the illustration work and graphic design of the game, we are almost ready to push the button.\n2. We already went through the production process with LongPack, while producing prototypes with mass-production techniques. So we are familiar with their requirements, leadtimes, and processes.\n3. Our manufacturer has a proven track record in the gaming industry and the quality of our prototypes has been outstanding. Communication has been very smooth so far and we are sure this will continue.\n4. We are working with specialized fulfillment companies like Ship Naked or HappyShops, we are sure they can handle all your pledges easily, they have the systems and the experience.\n \n Let us also point out that Monster Lands is not a one-off stunt for us. This is our first self-run Kickstarter project, but with B-Sieged we already gained considerable experience.

The Earth lies in ruins. In an instant, 99% of the world's population was dead or would be soon. Life as we knew it was over, and those of us who were \"lucky\" enough to survive the initial nuclear fires have had to adapt quickly to our harsh environment, or join the fallen. It has been said that no person has ever been promised a tomorrow, but now, the same could be said for the entire human race.\nThe red player\u2019s peaceful farming operation faces encroachment by the food-starved survivors of the green, pink, and blue players\u2026\nThis post apocalyptic setting is the world of Downfall, a brand new game from designer John D. Clair (Mystic Vale). In this 4X strategy game, each player will take control of a unique faction in the year 2213. It is a bleak and unforgiving future where survival is never certain and there is no prize for second place - you either rise to the top, or you fall into ruin and decay.\nUsing a unique card drafting mechanism, players will have several options on their turn. Will they forage for resources, abate radiation, or travel and explore the desolated wasteland with their citizens and airships? As the game proceeds, will they spend time researching new technologies or triggering conflicts with their opponents? All of these choices can earn a player points, albeit in different ways.\nCards have consistent major actions and different minor actions: \nWhen you choose a major Gather action, turn 1 raw resource token to its gathered side in every space with a regular survivor (equipped survivors do not Gather). Gathered resources can be stored or used to feed, Build, and remove radiation.\nWhen you choose a major Regrow + Excavate action, first place 1 raw food on each plains and clean water space you occupy. Second, place a raw matching resource on each space with one of your outposts.\nWhen you choose a major Bunker action, choose to either A: gain 1 survivor, B: gain 1 raw building resource, C: gain 1 culture point, or D: all of the above. Be careful not to gain more survivors than you can feed!\nWhen you choose a Build action, you may spend gathered resources from your storage or any space you control to equip survivors (1 metal), build airships (1 metal), bunkers (3 stone), or outposts (1 stone). You may also remove adjacent radiation (2 oil).\nWhen you choose a Command action, first place a command token on any space. Next, spend up to 2 movement points on separate units (airships may carry up to 2 survivors). Lastly, you may spend 1 oil to place an additional command token, or to gain an additional movement point.\nWhen you choose a Research / War card, you'll decide between the two options. If you choose Research, you'll look at your 10 technology cards, select one, pay its cost, then slide it under the corresponding column of your player board. That technology will be available every time you choose that action in the future.\nIf you choose War, you initiate conflicts in every space you occupy. First, battle strength is compared: the player with the most battle strength gains 2 victory points, and the loser gains 1. Command tokens are removed, and the winner may then either convert 1 enemy structure or airship to their own or kill 1 survivor. Any remaining survivors must then retreat to an adjacent space. (In the example above, the blue player gains a total of 5 vp, green and yellow gain 1, and red gains 2.)\nOnce all of the actions are completed, the cards chosen are discarded, and a new one is drawn by every player. If a \"Winter\" card is drawn, the game timer advances, causing a myriad of events (such as the spread of radiation, or having to feed your starving citizens) that will affect everyone. Once the Winter Track reaches the end, the game is over, and a winner is determined.\nEven though her exo-suit prevented the cold wind and driving sleet from reaching her skin, Abranna still felt the cold. She held onto her Ferro Rod while surveying the ruins around her, looking for anything useful.\nDownfall will be published in glorious Deluxified\u2122 format, with all the quality you have come to expect from TMG.\n  First, why don't we let the designer, John D. Clair, tell us in his own words what was behind his creation of Downfall:\n\"The design of Downfall came from a desire to create the perfect game for me and my tastes as a gamer. An epic, main-event, true 4X game. I wanted it set on an earth-based board (not space), with primarily economy based area control, but with the constant tension of tactical, non-luck based combat. I wanted it to play for a high player count without adding downtime, and I wanted the game to maintain a constant urgency in every decision beginning with turn one. It was a long road to go from initial concepts for a game this scale to a finely tuned game. Along that road there were quite a few major redesigns and months of sitting on the shelf while I worked on other games, but in the end I ended up with a game that I am more excited to pull off that shelf and play than any other game. The satisfying difficulty in each decision, the tension filled fast pace of each round, and the story arc building to a climactic ending make for a game that will take a really long time before I get tired of it. But take all of that with an ounce of salt because I designed the game for me. Hopefully it sounds like something that will fit for you as well!\"\nIf you would like to hear more from John Clair, he was recently a guest on the TMG Podcast.

(Click to zoom in.)\n  Tasty Minstrel Games is committed to not only publishing amazing and excellent games, we also want those games to look amazing and excellent as well. Our past Kickstarters for Orleans and Yokohama have set a high mark for Deluxified\u2122 components, and we will continue that standard of quality with Downfall.\nThe additional cost for the Deluxified\u2122 components matches our cost with no additional profit, to make and deliver them to you the backer. For this reason, TMG will only make a Deluxified\u2122 version through crowdfunding. We will make enough for Kickstarter Backers, some replacement copies, and some convention sales in Limited Quantity. \n  Check out this fantastic How To Play video from Paul Grogan at \"Gaming Rules!\"\n  Still want more?

Though we have pored over them and done our best to cover every possible scenario, we still consider them \"work in progress\" - feel free to offer your feedback! Our development team will review any/all comments prior to final proofreading.\nReach these stretch goals one at a time and help rescue civilization from its Downfall!\nDownfall is an epic 4X game about trying to prevent the end of humanity. For something of this magnitude, and for those of you who have the space on your table, we are offering Upsized Map Tiles!\nThe artwork will be identical to the standard tiles, but enlarged to give you plenty of extra play space and to show off the incredible detail.\n\nThe tiles will cost $20 and will be shipped in their own box separate from the base game.\nThe Upsized Map Tiles will be compatible with both the Deluxified\u2122 and Retail versions of Downfall!\n  TMG is excited about Downfall, and we think gamers are going to enjoy it immensely. That being said, we wanted to get the opinions of some of our favorite reviewers, so we sent out some prototypes for them to play.\nJeremiah the Boardgame Renegade let us know he loved the tension of the game and really liked the card drafting mechanism!\nAnd here is what Kristi thought over at Peace, Love & Games!\nOur friends over at Epic Gaming Night gave the game a great review as well!\n  Moe's Game Table did an excellent written review of Downfall - you can find it HERE\nStay tuned for more reviews!\nPeople have come to expect a premium experience when choosing to support a Deluxified\u2122 TMG game.

This will ensure that your copy arrives in pristine condition, ready to enjoy. The following is an unboxing of a Deluxified\u2122 Yokohama, to illustrate what we are offering:\nPLAY\n\nNote: While the town of Yokohama was one of 1% of the Earth that avoided the desolation and ruin of the 19 day war, the TMG game bearing its name is not able to be combined with Downfall for even more epic playing purposes.\nIn addition to premium packaging this project is:\nWhat does Friendly Shipping mean? It means that for each of these countries we will be sending bulk shipments to fulfillment partners paying VAT and fulfilling more directly. We have also done all we can to ensure that globally everyone has a good experience with the best shipping options that we could source. Whenever a shipping partner has the games and is ready to ship, we give the green light. This means that some parts of the world might receive their game a few weeks before other places. This is done so that you get your game the earliest we are able to get it to you!\n\nShipping prices for some of our backers for Downfall can be found on the table below. \nIf your country is not listed above, please refer to your selected pledge level to determine shipping costs.\nTMG is offering a Retailer Level pledge for Deluxified\u2122 copies of Downfall. These will include all of the stretch goals and be identical to the other Deluxified\u2122 copies. Only Brick and Mortar retailers can pledge at this level. \n\nRetailers can order 4 or 8 copies for $240 or $480 each which will include shipping. This is for US delivery addresses only. Retailers outside of the US will need to use a US forwarding address.  \nThe pledge tier cost of $30 will applied toward the final payment and final payment will be due just prior to shipping the games.\nAt the close of the Kickstarter campaign, retailers must provide a copy of their business license or similar information as proof of their retail business to qualify for this pledge level.\nWe are excited to offer this option to our Retailer partners so we can explore even more ways for people to enjoy the Deluxified\u2122 version of our game.\nAll of us here at TMG realize that a good relationship between publisher and backer during a crowdfunding campaign is paramount for it to be a success. It is our goal to make sure that the communication in the Kickstarter projects run by Tasty Minstrel Games will among the most active and connected to be found on the crowd funding platform. To achieve this, TMG will do the following:\n\nFor the first 7 days of the campaign, we will post updates at least once every 72 hours. In addition, during normal business hours (8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Mountain Time on weekdays), the comments page will be monitored for questions and those will be answered by the TMG Staff. \nAfter the first 7 days, while the campaign is live, we will update the campaign at least once a week. The comments page will continue to be checked on a regular basis (but not continuously monitored) every day and questions will be answered at those times. \n After the campaign has concluded, the comments page will continue to be monitored on a regular basis, but with less frequency than before. Any questions posted will be answered when they are seen. Updates will be sent whenever new, pertinent information about the campaign can be relayed to backers. If 30 days go by without new, pertinent information, a quick \"all is well\" update will be posted to maintain communication with our backers. \n After the games have been sent to our backers, and fulfillment has been completed, we will consider the campaign to be concluded, and any further communication would need to go through our normal support lines.\nIt is our mission and our intent that with these guidelines, our backers will enjoy an unprecedented level of connection to the campaign, ensuring a satisfying experience from the beginning of the campaign to the day that the game is delivered to them, and beyond.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTasty Minstrel Games (TMG) has delivered numerous games throughout the world.

Free Bonus dollars will be added to your pledge manager account for you to use.\nSTRETCH GOAL #3 - UNLOCKED - All dice now available in Cotton Candy color.\nSTRETCH GOAL #2 - UNLOCKED - All backers will now receive an extra 2% in dollars (rounded down) to spend on the dice menu.  Free Bonus dollars will be added to your pledge manager account for you to use.\nSTRETCH GOAL #1 - UNLOCKED - A true 3 sided D3 (the Apple D3) was added as a free die to many sets and one you can purchase individually in all colors as well.  \nTHE STORY BEHIND THE DICE   \nImpact! Miniatures is seeking to add to their dice of unusual size with mass production of the final 4 dice we need to complete two different dice chains (a D17, D19, D26 & D28 sided die in 9 opaque and 2 speciality colors).  These 4 dice will allow Impact! to offer D20 dice chain sets with all the dice from D3 to D20 and D30 dice chain sets with all the even dice from D4 to D30 to RPG developers and players.\nImpact! has a lot of experience producing odd sided dice and the designs for these dice look great and have been tested to be as fair as possible despite having an odd number of sides. Due to assistance from Andrew at the Dice Shop Online (thank you very much Andrew!) and Joseph Goodman from Goodman Games (thank you Mr. Goodman!), we have been able to research the shapes and receive a small batch of the D17, D19, D26 & D28 to test the production designs. We are very happy with the test batch and want to get the dice into full production but really need your assistance to get the mass production run of the dice created.\nDICE CHAINS  (What are they?  Why are they great?)\nI have helped several game companies design rules for games.  When I was introduced to Dice Chain Mechanics for RPGs by Dungeon Crawl Classics and Freeblades I realized they created just a smoother set of rules for RPGs.  \nWith a standard RPG as your character progresses he/she receives +1 or more to their dice rolls but then you need special rules that a roll of a natural 1 still fails in the rules.  With Dice Chain mechanics as you character progresses the next dice in the chain is used.  So at level 2 your Barbarian rolls a D11 instead of a D10 when using an axe.  No need for special rules for failure as a 1 is still possible when they roll.   The problem was that no one made all the dice needed for a full dice chain for a D20 system or for a D30 system.   Four years ago, I started a quest to offer those two chains.   This KickStarter gives us the final 4 dice we need to complete those two dice chain sets.\nNew D24s and D30s and Compressed Resin\nAll sets in this KickStarter will contain my new D24 and D30 dice.  These two dice were redesigned to make them roll better based on customer feedback.   In addition, all the dice for this KickStarter will done in compressed resin instead of acrylic.  We used acrylic dice on our first 2 KickStarter but have moved to the heavier and more durable resin for all our dice we manufacturer now.  These give the dice a better feel when being used and hold the color better as well.\nAlphabet D26\nDue to an investment from angel investor, a 26 sided die with one side for each letter in the Alphabet has been added to the KickStarter.  For now it is available in Black and Purple opaques as well as all the Specialty colors.\nCOLORS\nBelow are the colors that you can choose from for all of the dice sets in the project.  9 opaque colors and 2 specialty colors. \n DICE MENU\nBelow is a menu that you can use the amount you pledge plus any bonus dollars your reward level offers to pick your own custom reward.  When the pledge manager is released after the project is over, each backer will be able to select the dice sets, dice and colors that you want from the below menu.  All backers can add extra to their amount pledged to any reward level to use to shop with on the dice menu.  Stretch Goals many add on additional bonus dollars for you to use for free.  \n     STANDARD SHIPPING\nShipping will be charged after the KickStarter is over as part of the pledge manager based on current shipping costs.   Currently I expect these charges to be $5 for US shipping, $10 for Canada shipping and $15 to the Rest of the World.   PLEASE NOTE:  Shipping is EU friendly.   In the 3 previous dice KickStarters I ran I did not have anyone report paying customs so there should be no risk of customs charges on your reward.  \nWAVE 1 EARLY SHIPPING\nYou can add on money to your pledge for shipping your order early (or in 2 shipments).  Wave 1 shipping will be in February 2018 instead of July 2018.  Black, Purple, Rainbow, Translucent Teal and Glow in the Dark dice sets should be ready to ship by February 2018.  For an extra $5 for US addresses, $10 for Canada or $15 Rest of the World, your reward will ship (or as much as possible will ship) in February 2018.\nSOCIAL MEDIA  (or How you can help get yourself and everyone else more free dice and options)\nBelow are a list of stretch goal for the project.  I will do everything I can do get the project out there but nothing works for unlocking stretch goals like the backers of a project giving it some assistance.   Share the project on Facebook, Send out a Tweet that you backed it, Let friends know about it on group pages and forums.   If you want to get the most out of the project in terms of free items from stretch goals, a few seconds to plug the project will go a very long way and is deeply appreciated.\nSTRETCH GOALS\n   THANK YOUs\nThank you to Andrew Weir from the www.thediceshoponline.com for all of his support in helping fund the prototyping expenses throughout the project of creating these two dice chains.\nThank you to Joseph Goodman from Goodman Games (www.goodman-games.com) for taking a chance on an incredibly small company to provide the dice for a game as up and coming as Dungeon Crawl Classics.   This KickStarter would not exist without that support.\nThank you to my wife and 2 sons for supporting my business and assisting me getting my dice projects out the door so we can keep growing this part of the business.\nThank you to Casey Nordell, Magic Vince and Matthew Cornelisse for your assistance in designing the dice.\nThank you to my son, Sparrow, for all his help making my dice shop on Amazon.com successful. The Stretch Goal #3 color was designed by both of us and is a special thank you to him for his assistance with my dice business.\nAlso another thank you to Casey Nordell for naming the color of the dice for Stretch Goal #2.   My son and I tried to think of one better and could not especially when his birth name Andy is in the color name!\nThanks to http://worldartsme.com for the Dice border art\nFinally thank you to all the first day backers who make this project fund on its first day and all the backers who help us break stretch goal after!

Set in Aughmoore, the world of Tiny Epic Kingdoms and Heroes of Land, Air & Sea.\nHOOK: Fast paced, portable co-op, with a unique turn-deck mechanic.\nWIN: Defeat the Epic Foe!  \nLOSE: Let your Capital City get destroyed!\nBASE STORY: After the Great War (Tiny Epic Kingdoms), many of the factions, shattered and defeated, looked for something to cling to. One final hope before the last of their race would flow like the river into the ocean of history, gone and forgotten. It was the sages of the Order of Gamelyn who answered their prayers. They provided a new perspective on unity, and a way of life that would welcome peaceful members of any faction. A utopia for all. With very few options and a will to survive, this world alliance became an inevitable truth in the eyes of many of the factions\u2019 leaders. Even factions who hated one another had nothing left but each other. Under the guidance of the Order of Gamelyn, a Capital City was chosen and factions from all over the world came to call this city their new home. At last, the world was at peace\u2026 but not for long. A great storm is coming and in the darkness of the mist, there be demons.\nEXPANSION STORY: Aughmoore is in ruins. The evil could not be contained and its darkness has spread to every region of the world. Shattering villages and infecting all forms of life. There has never been a more dire need for Heroes. Everyone who remains must rise up, must unite, and must risk everything to preserve what little spirit remains.\nTiny Epic Defenders: The Dark War, an expansion to Tiny Epic Defenders, is the latest installment in Chronicles of Aughmoore. It introduces new Heroic characters like the Lionkin Charioteer and the Birdfolk Shadow Walker. It also introduces new Epic Foes, new Dire Enemies, and new Artifacts, but more importantly, it introduces new and exciting features that keep players making difficult choices from the edge of their seats.\nThese new features include a Campaign Mode with Enemy Generals, Skills that Heroes can learn, Advanced Regions and Caravans.\nCaravans represent the shattered homes of villagers during this dark time and are spread across all the Regions. Players are faced with the additional challenge of rescuing these Caravans and escorting them safely to the Capital City before they are can defeat the Epic Foe.\nSkills are useful abilities players can assign to their Heroes and require Experience Points to activate. Experience Points are now earned during play by making meaningful decisions that help the party reach their goals.\nThe Campaign Mode plays like an evolving gauntlet challenge, where players must play through the game multiple times, facing Generals at the intervals instead of the regular Epic Foe. The different abilities players will have at their disposal, as well as the threats they face, are unique to each Campaign and evolve with the choices players make during each Campaign. If players can survive long enough, they will face an Epic Foe at the conclusion of the Campaign.\nThe Advanced Regions introduce new threats and also new abilities to aid the players in The Dark War. These new threats and abilities come in the way of 3D constructs like a giant Tree Heroes can hide in, a flying Manticore Heroes can ride, or mysterious Sandstorms! They play a big part in the evolving Campaign Mode. Each Advanced Region features a dark, harmful, side and a light, helpful, side. As players progress through the Campaign Mode, they will work to restore the dark regions to their helpful side. Making the right choices to restore these Regions and rescue the Caravans is critical to achieving victory in Campaign Mode.\nOwn the original Tiny Epic Defenders and curious about what the changes are? Here's what's changed: \nAll new art, component upgrade to include ITEMeeples\u00ae, gameplay changes to give players more control over the outcome of the game, and as a result, it's more fun! Try it yourself by downloading the FREE Print 'N Play below.\n    Everyone loves stretch goals, us included!

We are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way. They have fulfilled many projects and have proven to be communicative, punctual and respectful when dealing with our customers.\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication.

Avoid the curses that will trick the unwary in these dark times. \nThe clans offer aid to each other, but only the leader of the most prepared clan will be named Guardian of the Realm.\nEach round, replenish your hand to 6. You can draw from the common face-up pool, or unseen from the deck.\nNow you must make an offer of resources to another player, by choosing 1 or more cards that are all the same.\nYou may tell the truth about what type of card they are, or you may bluff. You must not lie about the number of cards though.\nThe recipient must decide if you are truthful or bluffing.\nWhen you lose an offer, the Council takes pity on you and bestows to you a coin. You can also win coins by acquiring cards that match your affinity bonus. This can be from an offer you receive or that you make!\nIf you have enough coins, you can buy resources directly into your tableau for 3 coins.\nOr you can spend 5 coins to dispel a curse from the open market and score 5 points.\nAs you add supplies to your tableau from successful offers, each scores differently. See the breakdown below. How will you choose to pursue victory?\nThe Council convenes near the midpoint of the game, and scoring takes place with quests and the Castle track. Then finally War is at hand when its card is drawn, triggering the last round of the game. \nThe dragon and orcs have arrived at the city gates.

It\u2019s also, thanks to the support of over 12,000 backers, one of the biggest board game worlds ever created!\nThe game became a reality thanks to over 12,000 backers, but the cost of making such a game is so high that a retail version is almost unfeasible. However, we wanted to give you another opportunity to get your hands on it: your last chance\u2026 to get cursed.\nThe Expansion \u201cWhat Goes Up, Must Come Down\u201d invites you to come and discover, or perhaps return to, The 7th Continent for some fresh adventures! Two new curses are waiting, each with their own unique gameplay elements, for you to discover.\nIn \u201cA Prison of Clouds\u201d you\u2019ll find yourself aboard a Hot Air Balloon, in search of salvation and in \u201cThe Veins of the Earth\u201d you will delve deep below the Continent in order to triumph over the Evil consuming you.\n\u201cEasily one of my favourite games of the year. This is an amazing game and possibly the best adventure board game ever designed. Excellent!\u201d\nTom Vasel \u2013 The Dice Tower\n\u201cThe 7th Continent is the best exploration game I\u2019ve ever played. Every decision is interesting, the sense of cooperation and collaboration is strong, the freedom to roam is liberating, and the mystery is fascinating. This is a must-buy!\u201d\nJamey Stegmaier \u2013 Stonemaier Games\n\"The 7th Continent is quite simply a watershed moment in enthusiast gaming. Encapsulating all that was great from the LucasArts adventure games of the past, Serious Poulp has crafted an analog experience that continually inspires exploration and invokes a constant sense of wonder. The ripple effect of this game will be felt for years to come in the Boardgame Industry and should most definitely be enjoyed by all.\"\nJeremy Salinas \u2013 Man VS Meeple\n\u201cThis is the ultimate survival/exploration board game.

Make difficult choices and face the consequences thanks to the game's innovative mechanics that determine success or failure!\nAlmost 1,000 cards for the base box alone with hundreds of pieces of original artwork.\nJoin the expedition any time, even if you missed the beginning of the adventure or died during it.\nLive a different adventure every time! There are dozens of random events and several alternatives for each individually numbered card.\nThere are consequences to your actions. If you kill an NPC, they will remain dead for the rest of the game and any options or alternatives that you might have had by letting them live will be gone\u2026forever. Let them live and they might help you later. Then again, they might not.\nAn expansion with two brand new curses, each with their own unique gameplay mechanics!\nThis expansion, which requires the base box, is compatible with all previous expansions.\nIt includes over 250 new cards, including two new curses, which you will have to overcome if you hope to leave the 7th Continent alive. Each one will provide a unique experience, pushing the survival skills of both novice and veteran explorers to the limit.\nThis new expansion has its own \u201ccollector\u2019s\u201d box that \u2013 combined with the base box \u2013 can store all of the cards of the base box as well as all of the expansions (even if everything is sleeved) and other materials. It includes:\n3 Storage trays\n250+ cards\n1 Hot Air Balloon miniature (+ alternative cardboard standee)\n1 Barge miniature (+ alternative cardboard standee)\n7 new Dividers\n1 rule sheet\nThe curse, \u201cA Prison of Clouds\u201d, will send you on a whirling adventure OVER the 7th Continent!\nAboard your hot air balloon, you\u2019ll soar over the continent thanks to an innovative wind management system, which will lead you to new, unexplored tracts of land\u2026\nYou can land at any time by taking the Terrain card with the same number as your current Sky card, allowing you to continue exploring on foot. When you wish to take off again, simply make your way back to the card where you landed and your aerial adventure continues.\nTake care though, as each trip will tax you. Hunger, confinement and violent winds will test your nerves.\nMake short trips and improve your piloting abilities if you want to stand a chance of lifting the curse that keeps you trapped in this hopeless land.\n\u201cThe Veins of the Earth\u201d will drag you down into the bowels of the earth where an underground network of serpentine waterways spans the entire length of the continent.\nAboard a barge of aboriginal design, your actions will be limited as the current draws you ever deeper. Make the right choices at the right time or you\u2019ll end up lost and doomed in the pitch black.\nAs insane and suicidal as it may seem, you have no choice but to forge ever onwards into the darkness. What manner of horrors await you? It matters not, as long as you can free yourself from this curse!\n\"Satchel & Journal\" Binder\nThis new accessory will allow you to store all the \u201cQuest Item\u201d cards that you\u2019ll acquire during your adventures, just as if you were jotting them down in your journal!\n1907. A renowned explorer, you have just returned from the first expedition on the seventh continent, a mysterious land that was recently discovered off the coast of Antarctica and is very likely the last Terra Incognita in the world.\nYou are recovering from your adventure when, whilst reading the daily newspaper, you realize that several other members of the expedition have disappeared suddenly, for unknown reasons.\nCoincidentally, you have been lethargic for a few days, feeling feverish and finding it difficult to get out of bed. A cold shiver runs down your spine and you are in a constant state of depression and malaise.\nYou are going to have to face the facts: an evil is consuming you from within. When night falls, you slip into a restless sleep unaware that, for you, this is only the beginning...\nYou start each new game by choosing one of the available characters. Each one comes with their own set of Skill cards that represent their abilities and personality (adventurer, herbalist, doctor, mercenary, etc.).\nKeelan: an explorer and keen Botanist. One of the explorers available to you with an example of her Skill cards.\n\u201cThe Voracious Goddess\u201d, \u201cAn Offering to The Guardians\u201d, \u201cThe Bloody Hunt\u201d, \"The Dark Chest of the Damned\" - Choose which curse (or curses!) has been put on you from those included in the base box (4) or those in the expansions (5).\nYour goal? Find out how to lift the curses you have chosen and then purge your soul of them. Each curse offers a very unique adventure and will take you to different places. Obtain the unobtainable, discover that which is forever hidden, and strive against the impossible.\nDo you have what it takes?\nA Curse that you can attempt to lift and its clue.\nYou are now ready to begin your unexpected adventure. Similar to the books where \"you are the hero\u201d, you will explore the continent by putting numbered Terrain and Permanent event cards into play, which will gradually form the game board.\nForests, deserts, caves and mountains - you will visit dozens of different locations during your adventures as well as encounter random events that coincide with your location.\nTo progress through the game, you will perform the actions available on the Terrain card your miniature is standing on, the Event cards attached to it, and the Character, Skill, State and Bonus cards in your hand and the Items in your inventory.\nIn order to perform these actions, you will use the Action Deck that contains your Skills and simultaneously serves as your life force.\nEvery action makes you draw a certain number of cards from the Action Deck. These cards provide a variable amount of successes and you must obtain a specified number of them in order to succeed.\nFight action: draw 2 or more cards from the Action Deck to perform the action. Get 1 or more achievements to succeed.\nFailing when performing an action may have terrible consequences and cause you to get negative State cards, forcing you to discard cards from the Action Deck, and consequently reducing your life force.\nFall off this peak and you will likely get injured.\nWant to stack the odds in your favour? You may choose to draw more cards from the Action Deck to get more successes. However, every card in the Action Deck is a bit of your life force, so when the Action Deck is exhausted, so are you. From now on, every action could be your last!\nThankfully, the Skill cards that you may add to your hand when performing actions, your Bonus and Item cards, and the help from your companions will make things easier for you. This is especially true when it comes to decreasing the number of cards you must draw to perform an action or by increasing your chances of success.\nA faithful companion and a precious item.\nThe 7th Continent is a strange land with many paranormal events, hostile creatures and inhospitable locations.\nYou will have to use your best survival skills to overcome the varied threats you will face in this land, so that you can eventually lift your curses:\nFind or craft items to help you escape risky situations or access locations that would normally be unreachable without them.\nGather food, by hunting or fishing, in order to regain some life force, returning Action cards from the discard pile to your Action deck. Make a fire and cook it and you\u2019ll find that you\u2019ll get even more cards back!\nLook carefully at your environment. It contains many clues and hidden numbers that can help you uncover the Continent\u2019s many secret locations.\nThere are countless surprises for you to experience along your journey!\nA page from your journal that now allows you to use this plant when you see it on your Terrain card.\nYou can download the rules (.pdf \u2013 56 Mo) or check this video (26\u2019) to learn how to play The 7th Continent!\n\nEdit: cards from The Past must be returned between two game sessions.\nAll the expansions and optional purchases from the original Kickstarter will be available during the course of the second campaign.\nHow to add optional buys to my pledge?\n1. Click on the \u201cManage your pledge\u201d green button at the top of the page\n2. On the next screen, click on the \u201cChange your pledge\u201d blue button\n3.

A few weeks after the Kickstarter campaign ends, we will open the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d (PM) and invite you to fill it by telling us which optional buys you\u2019d like to purchase and in which language (English or French).\n \nIf you want to sleeve the ENTIRE game, including the Stretch Goals and any other content made available during the campaign, then you have to add both optional buys for a total of $79 which includes over 1600+ card sleeves (the \u201c+\u201d is additional sleeves included \u201cfor free\u201d for the upcoming Stretch Goals and optional buys).\nWhat would a Kickstarter campaign be without some Stretch Goats?\nAfter 4 years of work, The 7th Continent became a reality thanks to the support of over 12,000 backers. Without them, we wouldn\u2019t be here today.\nThe cost of making this game is high, notably due to the quality of its components. Due to this a retail version of the game is almost unfeasible.\nHowever, we want the game to live and continue growing as well as allowing those that missed out on the first campaign and/or some of its contents to acquire them.\nThis campaign is no doubt one of your last chances to take part in The 7th Continent adventure...\nThis new campaign will allow you to expand upon the adventure we all began back in 2015. With new curses and mechanics, a whole new experience awaits you! It will also allow you to acquire any elements you may have missed from the first campaign.\nFor those of you only interested by the \u201cupgrade pack\u201d: you will be able to procure it (at production cost) at our online store at www.seriouspoulp.com when it becomes available in 2018.\nFree Upgrade pack\nThis pack contains cards that will allow those of you possessing the first edition of the game to upgrade it to the second edition and 4 additional dividers to help you search for cards more easily (Characters' Skills, \"004\", \"051\", \"109\"). It includes any cards that may have been changed or corrected after the first campaign.\nNOTE: This pack is included in the Veteran pledge (which is specifically for those with a copy of The 7th Continent from the first Kickstarter campaign)\nNew Content\nIf you purchased all available content from the previous campaign and wish to complete your collection, then all you\u2019re missing is:\nThe expansion \u201cWhat Goes Up, Must Come Down\u201d: this expansion includes two new curses along with new ways to explore the continent.\nSatchel & Notebook binder: this game accessory will allow you to store all the cards that would normally be placed under the Satchel & Journal card.\nAll unlocked Stretch goals that become available during the campaign.\nThese items are included in the Veteran pledge.\nAlso, new \u201coptional purchases\u201d will become available during the campaign (see \"Optional buys\" section). \nThe USA, European Union, Canada and Australia will all be \u201cShipping Friendly\u201d. This means that backers from these countries will not incur any import taxes.\nAfter our experience with the first campaign, we are planning on two waves of shipping for this new project.\nThe First Wave will include the new \"Second edition\" base box and non-cards optional purchases (such as bone dice & dice bag, sleeves, etc.). This wave is slated for March 2018.\nThe Second Wave, due in October 2018, will include the new expansion \"What Goes Up, Must Come Down\", all optional buys with cards (old and new) as well as Stretch Goals from this campaign.\nShipping will be paid AFTER THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN, during the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d phase. Below, you will find an estimation of shipping costs per shipping area. Despite this, we are committed to these prices being the maximum amount you will have to pay.\nDuring the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d phase, you can ask to receive everything, including the Base Box, in Wave 2 (due in October 2018) in order to reduce shipping costs significantly when compared to the cost of both waves (although still more expensive than the wave 2 shipping shown below).\n*You can choose to have this optional buys shipped on wave 2 \u2013 instead of wave 1 \u2013 to avoid paying for the shipping fee associated.\n**Europe (A): Germany, United-Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland and Austria.\n**Europe (B): Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Czech Republic.\n**Europe (C): Albania, Armenia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Croatia, Finland, Iceland, Montenegro, Norway, Serbia, Turkey, Ukraine (Note: the lower part of the estimate).\nNote: recently updated for GREECE, ROMANIA and SWEDEN.\nAlso, South Korea is in Area 4 \u2013 lower part of the estimate\nWould you like to pledge for multiple copies?\nEach copy purchased includes all unlocked Stretch Goals. For areas 1, 2 and 3, shipping costs after the first pledge (up to a maximum of 7) are halved! We are still looking for solutions to get some discount for multiple copies for areas 4 and 5 as well (hopefully by the end of the campaign).\nWe\u2019re two friends that love playing and making games. Also, one of us is pretty handy with a pencil.\nFounded in 2010, Serious Poulp was all about seeing the games we designed come to life.\nSerious Poulp Inc. is the name of the North American branch of Serious Poulp. It was created in 2017 to help us develop our business in North America.\nThe first Kickstarter campaign for The 7th Continent was successfully funded back in October 2015 thanks to the support of 12,103 daring explorers! Two years later, with a lot of experience from this first adventure under our belts, we\u2019re back with some new ideas that we just couldn\u2019t keep to ourselves!\nLudovic Roudy and Bruno Sautter\nTwo friends passionate about all things gaming! We\u2019ve been working together for almost 15 years in the digital communication agency we created in 2002, then as Serious Poulp, which we founded in 2010, when the temptation to publish games became too strong to resist.\nRole-playing games and gamebooks played a significant part in both our childhoods. Bruno was 5 when \u201cThe Warlock of Firetop Mountain\u201d was published. Ludovic was 11 and already had a few prototypes on the go (one of which would eventually become The 7th Continent!).\nWe've been inspired by many great works during our lives, whether from board games, role-playing games or video games. When we started out in the board gaming industry, we naturally brought all of these elements with us.\nWe are not only the designers of the 7th Continent - Ludovic also creates all of the illustrations and visual elements for our games and Bruno, apart from writing cards and rulebooks, supervises production.\nJamie \u201cWhelpslayer\u201d Johnson\nJamie is the Community Manager for The 7th Continent and the scourge of small draconic beings. Rolling dice, pushing toy soldiers and trading sheep for many a moon now, Jamie is, just like you guys, a gamer at heart. He\u2019s also a publisher himself with his own company, Holy Grail Games.

A miniatures board game designed by Sen Foong-Lim and Jessey Wright, The Legend of Korra: Pro-bending Arena pits 2 players against each other in a sports game that features deep, strategic, head-to-head gameplay, highly detailed and dynamic miniatures, deck crafting and building, and team customization.\nThe game play of The Legend of Korra: Pro-bending Arena is closely modeled after the popular Pro-bending sport featured in the first season of Avatar: The Legend of Korra. As such, the game is designed for 2 players, each controlling a team of 3 benders: earth, fire, and water.\nBased on the events of Avatar: The Legend of Korra, Pro-bending Arena focuses on the championship match between the fresh-faced Future Industry Fire Ferrets and the sneaky and brutal White Falls Wolfbats.\nThe objective of the game is simple: be on the other team's side of the arena when the game ends and you will be victorious, or dominate the competition, pushing all their benders off the back of the arena to end the game immediately and claim the championship as yours!\n  The below videos will give you an understanding of not only how The Legend of Korra Pro-bending Arena plays, but also an understanding of how to play it, plus the strategies involved.\n      The Legend of Korra: Pro-bending Arena encourages players to experiment with their team's techniques and trick load out. This deep customization rewards players with endless ways to build their teams and defeat their opponents. \nDuring your match, you'll be able to focus your benders' chi and purchase new technique cards from one of their three strategy decks, each one separated by bender type. Not only does this mid-game deck building give players a chance to turn the tide of the match when a powerful card comes up for purchase, but it also allows players to min-max each of their strategy decks. \nThe strategy deck can be crafted before the game by players really looking to give their team an offensive edge. Being selective about what cards go into each one of your bender's strategy decks will give you the opportunity to control the plays you'll have access to as the game progresses. \n  Not only can you customize your team by crafting your strategy decks before the game, but you can really show your style via the trick cards you can load your team with.\nThere are two types of trick cards: incredibly powerful ones that can only be used once, or slightly less powerful but much riskier cheats that can be used multiple times but require players to roll a referee die each time they're used.\nCollect 2 yellow fans on a single bender and they're out of the game, putting you at a serious disadvantage.\nTricks allow players to supercharge their attacks, escape incoming barrages of elements, or even make their benders impervious to being pushed back. Deciding which tricks to take, and whether or not they're the risky yellow-fan cheats or one-time powerful tricks really allows players to make a team their own.\nDuring the course of this campaign, we will be unlocking 7 mystery teams as a free upgrade for your pledge. These are not stretch goals, they are guaranteed to be a part of your pledge no matter what our funding level ends up being! \nAdditional teams offer you a ton of new strategies. Not only will each team come equipped with their own unique special ability and strategy decks, but they also come with 6 universal trick cards that can be used by any team in the game. Meaning that even if you've already built your favorite team,  any additional team you add to your game will expand the options you have for your perfectly-tuned machine.\nOnce you've learned your new teams' quirks and perks, maximized their power potential, and earned your first championship, why not switch it up and draft your dream team?\nAdding teams to your core game will also allow you to participate in the Fantasy Draft variant. In this game mode, players can mix and match their favorite members from their favorite teams and experience the fantasy of combining two powerful special abilities into one devastating power play. \nWhen missing team members, all members still get their specific special ability, triggered by their technique cards. This can allow for unbelievable power combinations that will have Fire Ferret team members counter-bending elements alongside Wolfbats, dazing the opposition with illegal techniques.\n        The White Falls Wolfbats are the reigning Pro-bending champions. Being fan favorites, any question of the legality of their techniques and the legitimacy of their champion status is often brushed off as loser jealousy. Still, something about the way they play does ring a little unfair to even the most die-hard fans.\nIn The Legend of Korra: Pro-bending Arena, the White Falls Wolfbats have access to the some of the dirtiest tricks in the book. Their team special ability, Daze, allows the Wolfbats to put their opponents at a serious disadvantage with cheap-shots that cripple their next plays.\n    Fresh-faced and newly-formed, the Future Industry Fire Ferrets are the surprise stars of the Pro-bending league. Hailing from Republic City, the Fire Ferrets are best known for their teamwork and mastery of the elements. Well, okay, that's the second thing they're known for; they're primarily known for being the team with Avatar Korra playing for them.\nFocusing their chi on mastering the elements, the Fire Ferrets have become proficient in redirecting overly aggressive plays back against their opponents. Counter-bend takes your opponents' element tokens and adds them as part of your attack. These counter-bend techniques can change the course of the game in a single, well-planned play.\nKnown on the Pro Bending circuit for their teamwork, the all-female, all-amazing Rabaroos coordinate to unleash a rapid-fire flurry of elemental attacks. Ada, Ula, and Umi are guaranteed to bring you to your feet with their lightning fast bending. It\u2019s always action-packed when the Rabaroos are in the Arena!\nRally and Blitz \nWhat makes the Rabaroos unique are their twin icons, Rally and Blitz. Activate Rally to gain Rally tokens which you can then spend when you activate Blitz. Blitz permits you to draw a card from the top of your Main Deck, immediately launching an additional action!\n  The self-proclaimed \u201cBullies of Black Quarry\u201d, the Boar-Q-Pines specialize in relentless pressure. Many a team of Pro Benders have withered under the attacks of the rough-and-tumble Boar-Q-Pines. Chang, Xin, and Shui may be a little prickly, but they should never be underestimated!  \nPressure\nPressure tokens are this team\u2019s unique modifier, making your elemental tokens count for double when they hit. Even the weakest attack from the Boar-q-pines is a credible threat to be taken seriously!\n  The nimble and evasive P\u2019Li is one of the rare fire benders who has the ability to focus Chi into a concentrated line of concussive force. This Combustionbending is nigh impossible to block and nearly as difficult to avoid. After years of being held deep in the frozen wastes for 13 long years by the Order of the White Lotus, P\u2019Li has escaped and is once again after her quarry - Avatar Korra! Do not stand in her way!\nP\u2019Li's unique and powerful bending type makes her such a fierce competitor that she doesn't need any teammates by her side to be a Pro-bending champion. Her combustionbending cannot be stopped, meaning that elements placed in an attempt to defend against her attacks cannot annihilate her attacks. P'Li is limited by the amount of combustion she can bend, since she is only allotted 6 combustion tokens. Players using her as a team will need to be careful about how often they deploy those tokens, as after all combustion tokens are deployed any combustion icons played are ignored. \n  The pride of the Golden Temple, Haka, Josei, and Kano come to Pro Bending with years of experience under their belts. As they\u2019re not spring chickenpigs anymore, the Tigerdillos rely less on their athleticism and more on their wisdom as veterans of the sport. They know when it\u2019s best to fight and when it\u2019s best to regroup and refocus.\n Veteran\nThe Tigerdillos, while capable benders, may be past their prime in terms of raw athletic prowess. However, their Veteran status in Pro-bending gives their team members a sense of when to take advantage of the shift in battle gain even more of an edge over the competition.\n  The Buzzardwasps have mastered the art of attacking pressure points at a distance, making precise strikes against opponents instead of using brute force. Their infamous \u201cSting\u201d technique can make even the most iron willed Pro-bender lose focus. Shan, Ko, and Loong are aiming to take the championship trophy back to Bau Ling! \nThe Buzzardwasps deliver precision attacks directly to identified weak points. Their famous sting has a powerful bite, distracting opponents, causing them to lose focus and opening them up to more attacks.\n  Kuvira is not only a political and military genius, her Metalbending is without peer in single combat and her acrobatics allows her to dance between multiple foes. Kuvira can switch from attack to defense and back again within the same, seemingly effortless, sequence of complex moves. Underestimate the grace of \u201cThe Great Uniter\u201d of the Earth Empire at your own peril!\nKuvira, Superior Combatant\nKuvira\u2019s prowess at executing advanced techniques makes it impossible for a referee to judge whether she's cheating or not. As such her Prowess ability is versatile and powerful if you choose from all of the tricks available. To ensure that the game is fair, Kuvira cannot use Tricks that prevent her from being knocked back (such as Determination).\n  Unalaq's infamy goes beyond his devious machinations and his skilled waterbending, his ability to siphon off his enemy's spiritual energy makes him a foe unlike any other. Pro-benders find themselves imagining what facing-off against such an unconventional bender would be like. How would Unalaq's soul siphon affect them in the arena, how wound he combine his most peculiar ability with his incredible waterbending skills?\nSoul Siphon\nIf you have your Spiritbending token on your Villain board, you may spend it (return it to the supply). If you do, choose 1 bender in the target space of an attack. Your opponent must discard a card of that bender\u2019s element from their hand. If they do not have a card, return your Spiritbending token to your Villain board.\n      If you'd like to add the Amon expansion to your pledge please press the \"Manage my Pledge\" buttom at the top of the page and add $30. \nThe Legend of Korra: Pro-bending Arena Amon's Invasion expansion includes 3 game modes: \n1.

You must explore the station to discover powerful technology in the hopes of preparing your team, restore the functions of the Station while uncovering its true power, and battle against the other races that seek to control the Station as a means of ruling the galaxy.\nWhat is the Station? - The Station is a technological marvel that is currently floating nearly derelict in space. You are unsure of its origin, how it was damaged or how to fit it. But one thing is for sure, if you do not repair its systems in enough time to repel the enemy forces that are bearing down on your location, you will surely be destroyed. A fate that will most likely be shared with the rest of the galaxy.\nWho is Sil\u2019ahan? - An Ancient One, known as the Empress of R'lyeh, is your greatest enemy. She and her Eldritch forces have not only destroyed the Seraphic Homeworld but also eliminated nearly all of the escaped refugees as they were ruthlessly hunted down. You are unsure why she has such a hatred for the Seraphic, but you do know that the two cultures have existed for nearly all of recorded time and have been at war with one another for just as long. Her advanced fleet is commanded by her four daughters, their hunger for genocide appears to be a long standing family tradition. They destroyed your world and the station is now your last hope of survival. You must find a way to stop the reign of this ultimate evil before she and her forces destroy the galaxy.\nWho is Captain De\u2019sotoh? - The Captain is a Starling and a mercenary. It is not uncommon for those of the Starling race to take up this kind of trade, but it is shocking that De\u2019Sotoh would agree to work with the Ancient Ones and spread their villany throughout the stars. She is well known in the galaxy of being cunning and heartless. Some say she was not always this way. \nWhat kind of story can we expect from the Core Game? - The Secrets of the Lost Station core game will first help train you on how to play the game before you embark on two fantastic campaign expeditions. The first campaign will peel back the veil of secrecy that shrouds Captain De\u2019sotoh as she hunts the Station, seeking to capture it as a prize for her master Sil\u2019ahan. In the second campaign you will encounter the full wrath brought upon by the Ancient Ones. Your only advantage is that both Sil\u2019ahan and De\u2019sotoh seem fearful of the Station. Perhaps if you can discover why, you may have a chance of surviving the encounter.\nThe Inside Scoop: Secrets of the Lost Station was conceptualized during the creation of Secrets of the Lost Tomb. Together their stories weave an Epic tapestry of adventure, treachery and survival. Once you have explored both sagas, you will truly understand the Secrets that each hold.\nOverview: Oblivion uncovers the secrets behind the war of the races and offers a new level of difficulty as you battle against those tainted by Cosmic Dark Energy. Beware of the Darc Arc, as its powers rival that of the station and it has the ability to assimilate its technology. Also unlock new Darc abilities and items that have untold power, but also great consequence.\nWhat is the DARC? - The DARC is a new race of beings born from a cosmic energy that has entered this universe by untold means. All the EOP knows about this energy is that it corrupts all those who are infected by it, its affinity skews towards evil and the source is a titan known as Cosmos.\nWho is Cosmos? - Cosmos is a god-like being that is more powerful than anything the EOP has ever encountered. His origins do not appear of this dimension. His intentions appear to be of self-preservation and assimilation by feeding off of planets and the beings that inhabit them. A unique characteristic of this titan is that he is so powerful that he ensnares small planets and uses them as a satellite shields around his body, connected by Darc energy, to use as defense against any that try to stand against him.\nWhat happens to those tainted by Darc energy? - Both organic and mechanical beings can be infected by Darc energy. Once they are affected, they become possessed by the symbiotic energy and are enveloped into the collective mind of Cosmos. In addition to cosmos having complete control over these creatures the Darc energy also has the ability to synergize with its host making them more powerful than their native state of existence.\nThere seems to be lots of extra components in this expansion, what do I get? This expansion has content equivalent to that of a Core game. As you explore the galaxy you will encounter planets tainted by the Darc. These encounters may yield the assimilation of infected rooms to be absorbed into the Station. There are also Upgrades and Items of \"Untold power and Consequence\". These resources are infused with Darc energy, if you use them in an attempt to gain the power for an ultimate victory... be careful, you may also end up paying the ultimate price!\nWhat kind of story can we expect from this expansion? - The Story Arc in Oblivion features the climax of the Secrets of the Lost Stations Series. You will go on a cosmic \"CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE\" journey where the Station attempts to track down the Darc Arc in a race to rule the galaxy. During your journey you will be orbiting planets seeking resources to defeat the Darc Arc while trying to rid the planets of the corruption spread by the Darc Energy. This Epic conclusion will yield multiple boss battles including a station stand off and the ultimate battle against Cosmos. If your team can survive the encounter, you will ultimately discover the secret of the Lost Station... AND the Lost TOMB!!!\nThe Inside Scoop: There are multiple ways to defeat Cosmos, one of which depends on your ability to unite the races of the galaxy to form a collation. This special union is symbolized as part of the self-expanding nature of Secrets of the Lost Station by collecting the special tiles that are found in each of the expansions. Don't worry, you won't need every expansion to conquer the oblivion expansion, but if you do, you will be able to unlock a special ending!\n Overview: Machinations continues the Starling Saga cliffhanger introduced in the Core game. Further explore the backstory behind the Starlings and why members of their noble race would resort to piracy to survive. Reveal the story of Kon'hor the 1st mate of Captain DeSotoh and why he now must wear his exo-mech to survive.\nWho are the Starlings? - The Starlings are a noble high-born race reminiscent to a breed of space-elf-like creatures. Next to the Seraphic and the Ancient Ones, the Starlings are the third oldest race in the Stations universe. Similar to the other ancient races, their origins are not known by many, the only thing that is commonly known is that they are a very old race, not many of them exist in the universe, and they are well known for their sense of self-entitlement. They respect the other ancient races but look down on them nonetheless. The lower races however, they view them with such intense indifference that they see their freedom and culture are an opportunity for Starling expansion. This is why many of the Starlings have resorted to Mercenary tendencies. Another interesting point about the Starling culture is their breeding practices. Over the years, perfection has become a standard, and imperfection is not tolerated. Thus, the Starlings turned to science to engineer their culture to ensure not only survival but dominance. This point is exemplified by the existence of their caste system. At the top of the hierarchy stands the royals, which become captains of the pirate Armada. Next in line are the Quartermasters who act as the mutated bodyguards of the Royals. At the bottom of the social ladder are the Pirate Crew. These sniveling space lemmings are basically the Laser fodder of the race. However, be warned, what they lack in strength, they make up for in their numbers.\nWho is Kon\u2019hor? \u2013 Kon\u2019hor\u2019s is one of the only known humans to work in the service of the Starling race. He is also well known for his loyalty to Captain DeSotoh and the exo-skeleton that is required to keep him alive. The reason he requires the exoskeleton is both a story of legend and myth. The stories have been so wildly exaggerated over the years that the true story may be lost to history. One thing is for sure though, at the root of the story is Captain DeSotoh.\nWhat is Kon\u2019hor\u2019s relationship with Captain DeSotoh? \u2013 Kon\u2019hor is Captain DeSotoh\u2019s 1st mate, even though they command separate ships. *** The remainder of this section has been classified ***\nHow did the Starlings become enslaved by the Ancient Ones? Much of the Starling race are mercenaries. They have been under contract by the reigning queen of the Ancient Ones for hundreds of years, so it is a common misconception that they are enslaved, but in actuality, they are actually employed. The most infamous relationship is that between Captain DeSotoh and Sil\u2019ahan, empress of R\u2019lyeh. Their notorious partnership has held captive most of the galaxy for generations.\nWhat kind of story can we expect from this expansion? - The story arc in Machinations reveals the hidden story of Captain DeSotoh that is initially developed in the core game. You will also be introduced to the backstory of Cassy Opia and how she became a member of the EOP. At this point in the Epic saga you will have already experienced the treachery of Starling pirate mercenaries, however, this expansion will take all that you know of this race and blow it out the airlock! Expect the unexpected and brace for impact in this hard hitting expansion to Secrets of the Lost Station.\nThe Inside Scoop: If played in order, this story will reveal one of the 1st Special Paladin Tiles in the Story. Its function will be hidden for some time, but with great power comes great responsibility. Do you have what it takes to learn the secrets of the Starlings and survive?\nOverview: The challenges of Earth have become the challenges of Mars. You thought that part of your history was left in the past, until now, where you find you and your team caught between a long embattled civil war between the human resistance and their mortal enemies, the Draconians.\nWho are the Draconians? - For those that are fans of Secrets of the Lost Tomb, you already know the backstory. For those that are new to the lore, the Draconians are a race of half-human, half-dragon creatures. The pure bloods originally enslaved humans thousands of years ago, however after the uprising, their numbers were diminished so greatly the Dracs needed to breed with the humans for survival. Over the years their inherent magic ability has been almost bred out of existence. There are still a few that have enough blood of the elders running through their veins to harness the power of magic, but those with this ability are hunted with ruthless intent. Needless to say, the humans and the Dracs don't quite get along, in fact it's this relationship that brought the downfall of Earth and turned Mars into an Alien wasteland.\nWho is Kammora? \u2013 Kammora is one of the last Drac magic casters. She is the warrior princess of the wastelands and stands as the only opposition to \"King Rex\". Her might on the battlefield is well known on Mars... and will soon be known on the station!\nWho is Rex? \u2013 \"King Rex\" is the self-proclaimed ruler of Mars. He is the leader of the humans and of the Draconian resistance. Although he claims his manifesto is that of survival of humankind, his methods are more reminiscent of genocide, and his totalitarian style of rule has him more feared than respected. With the appearance of the Station over his planet, his aspirations to imposes his will now extend to the stars.\nWhy does the EOP have a Drac part of the team? Balthazar is a very unlikely ally of the EOP. His alliance makes him a lighting rod of hate from both narrow-minded humans and Draconians alike. The EOP however, has a great respect for their alien hero and are proud to call him a brother and advocate of peace. His skill on the battlefield is only matched by his understanding of alien technology.\nWhy are the Dracs and Humans at War? - For just about all of recorded history, from the time of the Elder Dragon Haltuth, though the reign of Emperor Dracus, to the current domination of Kammora, humans have been at war with the Dracs. The biggest difference is that now both human and Draconian are on the brink of extinction and both races are determined to help the other achieve this status. The root of this conflict for the humans is their long standing vendetta they have held against their original subjugators. For the Dracs, it's a matter of pride. They were born from the flame and being forced to breed with the low-born humans for survival makes them want to destroy them as a way of erasing the regrets of their past.\nWhat kind of story can we expect from this expansion? - The Station has sought refuge in orbit around Mars and its arrival activated local dormant technology. When a dirt-side portal activates and a moon-sized silhouette appears in the sky, it was only a matter of time before the Station would become enveloped in battle. Now that Rex has come to know of the station, he seeks to expand his influence beyond Mars. It won't be long until Kammora shows that she too has similar intentions, and with this, you know the EOP will be the last line of defense.\nThe Inside Scoop: A double boss expansion makes Resistance a must have. Double the story, double the threat. Do you have what it takes to survive and defend the Station from apocalyptic domination?\n Overview: Resurrection brings to life an evil thought destroyed over 1000 years ago. Battle against D.O.M.I.N.U.S. as he and his Cybermorph army try to take over the Station. A true battle of man vs machine in a struggle to either protect or enslave the galaxy.\nWho is D.O.M.I.N.U.S.? - The origin of the D.O.M.I.N.U.S. battle Satellite stems back to his creation by the humans back in circa 1980-90. But one can argue that he was actually his own creation. Humans originally created him as a Defensive Orbital Missile Interceptor and Neutralizer of the United States back during the Cold War against Russia. However, when his artificial intelligence prompted him to save Earth by eradicating its biggest threat, humans, the world found itself part of the Metal Dawn! Now 1000 years later, the Station faces a similar threat.\nWhat are the Cybermorphs? \u2013 Cybermorphs are the spawn of D.O.M.I.N.U.S. they are hive-minded machines that are sourced from local resources and used by D.O.M.I.N.U.S. to overpower local inhabitants as a means of protecting them. This artificial race consists of three designs, each with a specific purpose. First are the drones, they are flying sentinels that are the spotters for the stronger ground forces. They are many and come equipped with a mini railgun. Next are the Cyborgs, they are the soldiers of the A.I. army. They are nimble and come equipped with double Gatling guns. Next are the Exterminators. As the name would have it, these roving tanks have one purpose, to eliminate opposition. They are slow but very powerful enemies. And last, let's not forget D.O.M.I.N.U.S., he currently is an orbiting satellite, but you have a feeling there is more than meets the eye...\nWhy was D.O.M.I.N.U.S. orbiting Mars? \u2013 You can only speculate how he arrived around the red planet. With the limited intel you were able to gather from the Station archives, all indications are that he was destroyed back on Earth over a millennia ago.\nWho is T.I.M.? - You found T.I.M floating in an escape pod drifting in a distant orbit around Mars. When you brought the pod aboard the Station there was nothing inside it accept a silver metallic liquid. Once you entered the lower orbit of Mars, the liquid morphed into the shape of a human-like figure. Jack was the first to find him. Initially his programming was still activating, so when he introduced himself as a Technological Intelligent Mechanism, Jack just referred to him as the acronym T.I.M. and that is what the E.O.P. has called him ever since. His is believed to be an ally, and a very resourceful one at that. With limited resources, you need all the help you can get. So fingers crossed, he seems to be on your side, for now.\nWhat kind of story can we expect from this expansion? - Just When you think things can't get any worse... During a recent battle you hurriedly requested Darwin warp the Station to the nearest Human-sympathetic world. As luck would have it, you arrived at your own home world of Mars. Shortly after arriving, a sensor sweep of the area accidentally awakens dormant technology. Your question of what you activated was quickly answered as the portal activation system was hacked and the Station becomes overrun with Cyborgs. You have become accustomed to fighting aliens with enhanced technical weapons... but fighting enemies that are themselves technical weapons, is a whole other story!\nThe Inside Scoop: D.O.M.I.N.U.S. is one of two cross-over bosses of Secrets of the Lost Station. He was originally designed for a separate game called Metal Dawn that was designed earlier in 2017. He became such a beloved enemy of the Epic roster, we decided to extend his story into Secrets of the Lost Station.\n Overview: Rhaz-Azul Ahmet, an ancient evil well known by the EOP, exists in the future and in the past. He has arrived on the station to impose his will on the universe. Battle against this foe of legend, protect the station from his Fallen Seraphic minions, and learn more about how the Secrets of the Lost Tomb and Station are interconnected!\nWho are the Seraphic? \u2013 In the Secrets of the Lost Station universe, the Seraphic are the race with the highest affinity towards good and they live in opposition to the only race to rival their inherent power, the Ancient Ones. On the surface, the Seraphic seem to be a race of benevolent, god-like beings, living in a utopian society. But the E.O.P., having firsthand experience of their culture, know this perception is only partially true. The only way this \u201cgolden\u201d race is able to maintain its prestige and power is through a strict code of rules, which if broken, yield an ultimate consequence. To maintain a perfect society, there is little margin for error, thus most punishment usually results in banishment or exile. For non-Seraphic races that are exiled, they are cast out, which in most cases, results in death as these adopted lifeforms were usually unfit to survive on their own. For the Seraphic that are banished, they are no longer considered part of the society, and to ensure they are no longer seen as representation of the ideal race, they have their most distinguishable feature removed, their wings! Now they must live the rest of their life marked as \u201cunworthy\u201d. Over the eons, this practice has resulted in the unintentional creation of the counterculture known as the Fallen.\nWhy did the Seraphic save the Humans from Mars? \u2013 The Seraphic by nature look to bring balance to the universe. Those that are worthy of being saved from overwhelming opposition are granted safe passage to the Seraphic home world to rehabilitate and become emissaries of peace. It is not a surprise that the E.O.P. qualified for this stay of extinction, as they had acted as the protectorate of humanity for centuries. However, not all Seraphic agree with the decision to have saved this select group of humans, and in the end, some actually blame the humans for having brought the destruction to the Seraphic home world.\nWho is Rhaz-Azul? \u2013 For the fans of Secrets of the Lost Tomb, you know Rhaz as the iconic pharaoh-villain from the first Scenario of the Core Game. For those new to the Secrets of the Lost Station universe, you will come to know Rhaz as a futuristic Dark Paladin, hell-bent on revenge against the humans. His character Arc is one of the most dynamic and twisted reveals of the Secrets storyline!\nWho is Feonix, and why does she not have wings? \u2013 It is true that although Feonix does not have wings, she is in fact a Seraphic. To be more specific, a Fallen. She is an amazing warrior, but very secretive of her past. Some of the E.O.P. know of her deeds and why she was banished, but none dare to speak of it. Some remain silent out of respect, but most do so out of fear.\nWho is Brey\u2019del? \u2013 Breydel is a powerful friend of the humans. She had been completing her training to become a paladin when the Seraphic home world was attacked. She never completed her training, but was successfully able to find the Seraphic caravan and reunite with her father one last time before the final fateful attack by the Ancient Ones. She may be young and inexperienced, but one day her greatness will be known throughout the entire galaxy.\nWhat kind of story can we expect from this expansion? \u2013 The Seraphic story line revels a key narrative that joins the secrets of the Lost Tomb with that of the Lost Station. Many backstory plot lines will be uncovered as you seek to protect the Station from the fury of Rhaz-Azul. On the horizon of your timeline, you see the past and the future converge. Can you muster the courage to press on? Will you look into the mirror of fate and survive? Have your brothers in arms taken up arms against you? The only way to find out these answers, and many, many more, is to step through the portal to discover the Secrets of the Lost Station!\nThe Inside Scoop: Rhaz-Azul was a keystone character from Secrets of the Lost Tomb. He was such a recognizable boss from the franchise we had to have him make a triumphant return in Secrets of the Lost Station.\nAll shipping will be charged in the pledge manager for this campaign. Below are the estimated shipping costs for the different pledge levels.

Sunday dinners, deli runs... and \"Pizza Night\" was almost every night. A big family with seven hungry sons, we were always fighting over that eighth and final slice.\nNow we have our own families, and we can eat as much pizza as we'd like, but something seemed missing. Maybe it was the nostalgia... or maybe just a few tastebuds. Whatever it was, we found ourselves putting hot sauce on everything... especially pizza!\nThere's Sriracha for Asian cuisine, Cholula for everything south of the border, but what about Italian food? How about a legitimate hot sauce made for pizza, pasta, and paninis? A lightbulb went off, and \"The Original Italian Hot Sauce\" was born.\nWe've spent the last few years perfecting our recipe and jumping through all the necessary hoops to get Italian Hot Sauce ready for market. It's too great an idea and too damn delicious not to share with the world. So, here we are! With your help, we can keep the dream alive!\nOur handcrafted recipe begins with red hot cayenne peppers, aged to perfection to ensure a rich and earthy taste. We add the classic Italian flavors of garlic and oregano to create the ultimate hot sauce for pizza, subs, and all things Italian food. Buon appetito!\nMade with only five simple ingredients (peppers, garlic, oregano, vinegar, and salt), Italian Hot Sauce is preservative free, gluten free, fat free, sugar free, non-GMO, vegan, all natural, and hippy friendly.\nOur ultimate goal is to bring Italian Hot Sauce to every table across America. Your generous pledge will allow us to:\nOrder bottles, equipment, and ingredients for larger scale productions.\nProduce thousands of bottles of Italian Hot Sauce for commercial sale.\nDevelop an impressive online presence and social following.\nPresent and contribute to trade shows, local festivals, stores, and restaurants. \nThank you for helping our hot sauce dreams become a reality!

The book contains a series of five or more adventures set in the Hockomock swamp in Massachusetts to be used with 7th edition Call of Cthulhu RPG.\nThis product is produced under license from Chaosium Inc. (www.chaosium.com). Call of Cthulhu is the Registered Trademark of Chaosium Inc., and is used with their permission. www.chaosium.com\nThe Devil's Swamp includes adventures that can usually be run in one or two evenings. They can be run as independent one-off adventures or strung together as a mini-campaign using the same characters. All of the stories are set in the Hockomock which literally means 'the place where spirits live.'\nAs a member of the Bridgwater Preservation Society, you and your friends investigate the stories people plague the city and area with. The stories the police won't investigate, or quit on way too easily. Living next to the Hockomock, at the heart of what will later become known as the Bridgewater Triangle, gives you easy access to delve into any of the stories that arise. \nThe Hockomock Swamp, named the Devil's Swamp by the original English settlers, is a known site for paranormal activity. Everything from Bigfoot, aliens, thunder birds, huge snakes, strange lights, Puckwudgies, Native American curses, cultists, mutilated animals and more have been reported in the area. So join me and my team as we help unravel the Mythos tied to the mysteries of the Hockomock.\nThe Devil's Swamp is written by Ben Burns, features the artwork of Evgeny Maloshenkov, the cartography of Bryan McWhirter, player handouts by Elizabeth Bakowski and edited by Alex Burns. In other words the entire team that produced The Star on the Shore. We are the same company, just a change of name.\nJoin us in completing this great adventure book, so that we can share it with the world. Please back our Kickstarter today to help make these adventures a reality.\nThe funds will go toward the artwork already commissioned, extra adventures by guest writer(s), allow for more artwork, commissioning of the cartography for the maps, the editing, printing and shipping.\nStretch Goals\n$5,000: We successfully funded!!

Evgeny Maloshenkov was the main artist for The Star on the Shore and will be doing 90% of the art work in Devil's Swamp. He is a professional artist from Ukraine. He now lives in Kiev working for Frogwares doing software CGI art. He still freelances commission work for several companies including Chaosium as well as New Comet Games. You can see more of his work at his portfolio site here: emaloshenkov.carbonmade.com\nPage Count\nWhile we will not guarantee any minimum page count, the first 5 adventures are almost finished, and the book is currently around 60-70 pages. The more people pledge, the more adventures we will add in and the longer the book will be. If we hit the stretch goal for 6 adventures, it will probably be 70-85 pages. If we hit the stretch goal for 7 adventures It will expand to be 85-100 pages. If we hit the stretch goal for 8 adventures, it will expand to be 100-120 pages. If we get all the way to 9 adventure modules, we could push this well over 130 pages!\nThe delivery time for the books includes the anticipation of the extra adventures.\nGuest Writers\nOur first guest writer is Brian Courtemanche. He will be joining our team at the $10,000 stretch goal level. He wrote one of the adventures in the award winning 'Doors To Darkness' book produced by Chaosium. In addition, Brian has been in Arkham Now; Terrors From Beyond; House of R'lyeh; Atomic Age Cthulhu; and More Adventures in Arkham Country for the Miskatonic River Press.\nOur $20,000 stretch goal level will open up the 7th Adventure. This author worked with Brian on the award winning 'Doors to Darkness' book, Christopher Smith Adair.  https://csmithadair.com/  His works include A Cold Fire Within, Atomic Age Cthulhu, New Tales of the Miskatonic Valley, Strange Aeons II, and articles in the Arkham Gazette.\nOur $30,000 and $40,000 stretch goal scenario authors will remain under wraps until we draw closer.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere is almost no risk at all unless we sell a million or more copies, then there might be some delay in shipping, but I am willing to take on that challenge. Otherwise I do not see any real chance for any delays barring real life tragedy, or perhaps the stars aligning and Cthulhu rising. \n\nThe adventures are almost finished. The initial art is complete and the artist, Evgeny, is standing by ready to draw any stretch goal art. Our cartographer, Bryan, is ready to start on the maps as soon as we fund.

News@11 is a cyclical story-telling game for 4 to 11 anchors. Fill in cue cards, incorporate the topics on them into your segment as you build the story. Stories from the morning news come back in the afternoon and evening, getting stranger and more tangled each time. No points, no scoring, just a hilarious time telling the news! Lights, Camera, you\u2019re on in 3, 2, 1...\n  Learning to play News@11 is super easy!\n           Want to learn more? Awesome. Here's a link to the rulebook for you readers... and a gameplay video below for everyone else.\nCheck out the Rule Book Here\nTo help you get a feel for how the game works, we gathered up some friends and recorded a play through for you. Enjoy!\nFor this demo, we only filled in 1 cue card each (to keep things moving). Normally you'll fill in 1 blank on each card during setup\nNews@11 will come in a sturdy, portable box -- easy to bring with you, and has room to sleeve your cards. Besides a full color rule book, each box is packed with high quality components:\nCue Cards (130) - Every card is unique! Each card has 1 topic supplied by us and 2 prompts to customize. You'll fill these in with your group's topics each time you play.\nSegment Cards (10) - The Lead Anchor uses these to pick which Segment each Anchor delivers during a broadcast.\nProducer Cards (6) - The Producer uses these to help the game move smoothly - or to cause a little chaos. No talking required to use the Producer cards!\nMarker (1) - A permanent marker, used to fill in the Cue Cards. Style TBD \nRulebook - Learn to play quickly with game play examples.\nTechnical Details: All cards are 63 x 88mm. The box will come with room for the cards to be sleeved.\nWe have 2 reward tiers available, depending on if you want to get 1 or 2 copies of News@11. Want 1 for friends, 1 for family? Got 2 gaming groups? Planning to make 1 clean and 1 naughty? Great! Get 2 copies of News@11 delivered to your door.\nShipping will be added on based on your country after you select your pledge level.\nShipping to Canada, UK, EU, and Australia will be Customs Friendly and should not incur import duty.\nIf we hit our funding goal, we'll be able to put even more great content in the box for you! More to come...\nWhat are stretch goals? Great question! Once a Kickstarter project reaches its initial funding goals, stretch goals give us new targets to strive for to make News@11 even better!\nThe Tabletop gaming community is thriving! It's been an incredible experience as a publisher watching the community grow so much over the past few years. It's an exciting time for us as gamers with so many unique and interesting games, and I'm honored to have you consider News@11 as one of those options. \nHere are just a few reasons why we feel this project is worth your support: \nApproachable Gameplay - You can learn News@11 in just moments and get right into playing. The game is designed to give structure and flow to your experience while leaving room for players to take the story where they want it to go.\nHigh Customizability - As you play, you're creating a customized copy of the game that's unique to your group. The topics you add can be anywhere on the spectrum of family friendly to edgy; it's up to you!\nSupporting Independent Game Design and Publishing - Everything you see in this project is the product of a massive effort by several passionate, independent creators. The efforts that went into the game design, graphic design and publishing are all crafted by individuals who absolutely love our hobby. Without you, we wouldn't be able to bring these creations to life!\nWe're excited to partner with the Infectious Play team to bring you News@11. It's been great working with the designers (Jon Gilmour, John Burns, Ian Moss, Travis Magrum, James Schoch, Earl Tietsort). They've worked hard to refine the game's flow and tune the content to help facilitate the best possible story-telling experience. Peter Wocken,  our veteran graphic artist, helped make sure the look and feel of the components make gameplay as smooth as possible.\nGreetings News Anchors!   \nFor those who are new to our games, welcome! For those who have supported us in the past, it's great to have you back! We're thrilled to be back on Kickstarter with our 9th project! Starting with Legacy: Gears of Time in 2012, all the way through Sagrada and Dome Crushers most recently, running these projects have each been incredible experiences, and I cannot wait to see where this one goes! Partnering with Infectious Play, News@11 is our 7th game (not counting expansions) and we're really proud to share it with you. I'm looking forward to communicating with you throughout the project and after. Please reach out directly in a message or in the comments if you have a question or concern -- I'll do everything I can to make your backer experience on this project the best it can be!

Coupling that with its approachable ruleset, Mint Delivery is a great tool for introducing new players to the genre of pick up and deliver.\nCheck out the Mint Delivery rules to see more detail about what makes Mint Delivery tick.\nAll Cards contained within a copy of Mint Delivery are printed upon Premium 305GSM blue core card stock. Mint and Truck Tokens are made of Wood and all other tokens are made from 2mm thick chipboard.

Similar to Mint Works, even though it's small there's a lot going on.\" - MichaelDyrud\nYou can download the rules here\nIn Mint Delivery, players take the role of a mint delivery truck driver, driving around the area taking orders for mints, then delivering them. Each player has two actions on their turn, such as moving, loading their truck, and upgrading the mints they are carrying. Once enough orders have been taken, the game ends.\nWhoever has fulfilled the highest value of orders will be deemed the employee of the month and win. \nFive24 Labs on Social Media:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nNewsletter\nDiscord\nMint Delivery was created after the success of Mint Works, with the idea to introduce another mechanism to non-gamers while still being interesting enough for gamers to want to bring it to the table.\nI wanted to come up with another quick easy to teach game for a mechanism that I felt didn't have a lot of options that didn't take a long time to play, while also straying away from games with direct conflict between players.\nPick up and deliver seemed like a really good place to start. Since the vast majority of these types of games tend to be quite long, and have a lot of gotcha kinds of rules.\nThat gave me this set of constraints that I utilized for making Mint Delivery:\nHas to fit in a mint tin \nHas to be taught as easy or easier than Mint Works \nHas to play quickly \nWith those constraints in mind, I started the task. \nSince it was to fit in a mint tin, I decided to continue the same visual style that we used with Mint Works, and also to continue the overarching narrative of Mort from the first game. It seemed logical to me that Mort has had a lot of success with his mint making company and has started to branch out and provide mints to more than just the local neighborhoods.\nThat gave a great foundation for the supply/demand chain that would be the foundation of the pick up and deliver mechanism. I didn't want the mint requests to be too flat, so i added some \"improved\" type mints to the mix at that point. Which essentially gives us 3 forms of currency instead of just one.\nFrom that point, it was all about creating orders for mints, a few locations to pick mints up from, and a map to lay it all out. And that's where we are now.\nIf you are excited enough for Mint Delivery that you just can't wait for the fully produced copies to get here from the factory, I have provided a limited pledge level.\nThis level will entitle you to a copy of the fully factory produced version of Mint Delivery as all other backers, but it will also include a hand made advance copy delivered shortly after the campaign ends.\nThe advance copies will be entirely hand made by me in my workshop and numbered. (e.g. 03/50.)\nThe advance copies will be of similar quality to the prototypes that you see in the review videos. See below for examples.\nPhoto Credit Eric from whatsericplaying.com\nBecause Mint Delivery is a small game in terms of physical size and weight, shipping costs are very reasonable. The manufacturing costs are low enough that VAT shouldn't be a concern.\nI wish that I could provide free shipping to the majority of places, however the low price point of the game means I have very little wiggle room for costs.\nThat said, I will be providing free shipping within the US, and applying a discount to shipping elsewhere equal to the cost of shipping within the US. Here is a brief chart explaining the shipping costs:\n* The vast majority of countries falls in this region, including: Argentina (AR), Australia (AU), Austria (AT), Bahrain (BH), Belarus (BY), Belgium (BE), Belize (BZ), Bulgaria (BG), Brunei Darussalam (BN), Canada (CA), Cayman Islands (KY), Chile (CL), China (CN), Colombia (CO), Costa Rica (CR), Croatia (HR), Cyprus (CY), Czech Republic (CZ), Denmark (DK), Estonia (EE), Finland (FI), France (FR), Germany (DE), Greece (GR), Hong Kong (HK), Hungary (HU), Iceland (IS), India (IN), Indonesia (ID), Ireland (IE), Israel (IL), Italy (IT), Japan (JP), Korea, Republic of (KR), Latvia (LV), Lithuania (LT), Luxembourg (LU), Malaysia (MY), Malta (MT), Montenegro (ME), Netherlands (NL), New Zealand (NZ), Norway (NO), Peru (PE), Philippines (PH), Poland (PL), Portugal (PT), Qatar (QA), Romania (RO), Saudi Arabia (SA), Serbia (RS), Singapore (SG), Slovakia (SK), Slovenia (SI), South Africa (ZA), Spain (ES), Sweden (SE), Switzerland (CH), Taiwan (TW), Thailand (TH), Turkey (TR), Ukraine (UA), United Arab Emirates (AE), United Kingdom (GB)\n** Brazil, Mexico, Russia and any countries not previously listed fall into this category.\nWe have partnered up with Mr. B Games to assist in the fulfillment process to ensure that everyone gets their rewards quickly, correctly and in great condition.\nI would like to support retailers who are interested in getting Mint Delivery before the game makes its way into distribution. If you're a retailer, please send me a message here on Kickstarter, or email md.retail@five24labs.com during the campaign for pricing information.\nWe will also be funding a re-print of Mint Works with this campaign, you can add extra copies of Mint Works at $10 each during the campaign, or later on during the pledge manager.\n\nNote: Any add-ons that you select will be delivered at the same time as the rest of your rewards from this campaign.\nSince the map doesn't change from game to game, we came up with the idea of using a mat for the game to play on during demos, it worked out so well that we have decided to add custom mint delivery mats on as add-ons to any pledge level as well.\nCurrently we are a small but potent team that consists of two Mad Scientists myself and Mel (you might recognize him as Mort) and our awesome testing group. \nI'd like to use this space to acknowledge and thank them. I have an amazing, excellent and dedicated group of players that tolerate my crazy ideas and endless iterations.\nThey are up to the task of attempting to break things, and giving real feedback as we develop projects.

Explore new worlds to grow your knowledge and Adapt to living in the varied habitats you discover. Expand your presence in the cluster with new colonies and Exploit the metal and energy resources you find. Ally yourself with assorted interstellar species and Acquire covert missions to increase your influence. Do all of this and you could become the dominant species in this cluster and to begin your reach into the galaxy.\n5-player Setup\nWe love the scope and majesty of 4X games but don't look forward to hours, or even days, that it can take to play the best of the genre and we weren't wild about all the extermination. Game designer Levi Mote set out to create a friendly 4X experience in an hour-long game and, after years of development and play testing, Horizons has proven itself to be just that game \u2013 a Euro-friendly, decision-driven, 4X-style game that 2 to 5 players can enjoy in about an hour. \nHorizons has multiple paths to victory. Will you explore and ally your way to knowledge-win, or expand and exploit the worlds for a build-win? Perhaps allies and covert missions will bring you a missions-win, or you'll balance all three paths to create a well-rounded dominion. The choice is yours and the stars await. \nOne of the many Mission Cards.\n  We turned over one of our preview prototypes to Jon Gets Games and he delivered an amazing 1-hour video that takes you step-by-step through a three-person game of Horizons.\n                        Rahdo runs through the prototype! (Note: we will be adding player count numbers on Mission cards to tell you which Mission cards to play with according to player count.)\n\nAfter we reach our projects $20,000 funding goal, we've got a long list of stretch goals planned that will, hopefully, entice you and your friends to support Horizons. Spread the word, share our project with your friends, and let\u2019s see if we can unlock things like asymmetrical player powers, more ally species, new suns for your star cluster, and lovely component upgrades.\n                                           We're looking at alternatives for the punched player board that fit within the budget. For now, it will not be punched through in the final version until we can provide you with something we can all appreciate. \nHorizons will come in a box similar in size to Stone Age and will come with all of the components shown below, plus whatever you unlock through stretch goals.\nUnlocked Stretch Goals added to the game:\n6 New Star Classes, O, B, A, F, K and M\nBlackcore and Linen Finish Cards\n5 Optional Species Ally Cards with Exterminate Gameplay\n5 New Asymmetrical Starter Ally Cards\nUnique Faction Art for each Player Board\n5 Asymmetrical Player Boards\n10 New Mission Cards\n5 New Ally Cards\nAs with our other recent projects, Sailing Toward Osiris, Food Truck Champion, and Valeria: Card Kingdoms \u2013 Flames & Frost, we'll be working with our European partners to produce Horizons in multiple languages. You'll be able to select the German, French, Spanish, or English version when we send out the backer surveys after the project is successfully funded.\n    Rahdo's final thoughts! (Note: we will be adding player count numbers on Mission cards to tell you which Mission cards to play with according to player count.)\n                                                                                                                                                             This is a full PNP file for Horizons. It included the rules, 35 double-sided hex tiles, 60 cards, and 5 player boards.  It is 113MB. There are bound to be a few adjustments as we close in on the final rules and graphic design, but this will give you a good look into the components and concepts of Horizons.\n                                                It's always great to try before you buy, so why not give Horizon's a try on Tabletop Simulator. This build was created by Alexander, a frequent backer of our project, a fan of our games, and a skilled modder.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                       We do everything we can to keep shipping costs low and we subsidize a substantial portion of the actual shipping fees we are charged when we fulfill your rewards.\n  This project is EU Friendly, Canada Friendly, and Australia Friendly. Rewards to backers in those countries will be shipped from fulfillment hubs within their regional borders. We pay VAT when we import the games and utilizing the shipping hubs means you do not have to pay customs fees.\n\nGamers in Brazil, Mexico, and Russia, have a much higher risk of package \"loss\" once it reaches the local post offices. For this reason, we need to ship your packages by a registered delivery service like FedEx, UPS, DHL, or Global Priority. The higher costs we incur are reflected in the shipping fees added automatically when you make your pledge.\nWe like to support game stores around the world by offering the Kickstarter versions of our games to retailers during the campaign. We treat retailer backers just like other backers in that they receive their rewards before we release the regular retail versions into distribution, giving you a head start on your competition. You can see the Retailer 6-Pack pledge level in the right-side column of this project page.\nEvery game we create is a discrete project with its own development schedule and its own budget for production and marketing expenses. We bring each project to Kickstarter to give you, our fans and supporters, the opportunity to help us put the final touches on the game and to reserve your copies at the time when it will do the game the most good, both financially and creatively.\n\nSome say that a creator should not launch a new project until their previous project is completed and delivered. That system might work for a designer who is self-publishing a game, but for an up-and-coming company like Daily Magic Games, that system is not viable. At any point in time we are working on a dozen projects in various stages of completion. Right now, for example...\n\n10 Minute Heist: The Wizard's Tower delivered to most backers 2 months early and will hit retail stores on September 20th.\nValeria: Card Kingdoms \u2013 Flames & Frost shipped to 80% of backers for on-time delivery in August. The remaining 20% will begin shipping in September. Valeria: Card Kingdoms \u2013 Flames & Frost will hit retail stores in October.\nFood Truck Champion is at the printer and we expect to deliver to backers in October.

We are actively involved in the Comments section of each Kickstarter and keep backers up to date with plenty of updates post-Kickstarter. We like to make casual and gateway games in an effort to get more people to the table. Our games are easy to learn to help new players get in to the game faster, but they're also layered with strategy for the more seasoned players. We're based out of Seattle, Washington and like to focus on the growth and promotion of game design in the Pacific Northwest. We've even started a playtesting event network called PlaytestNW to help local designers meet each other and engage with playtesters on a regular basis.

We realize that the publication of a tabletop game can be complicated and, no matter how experienced the project creators and mangers are, some problems may occur. In an effort to reduce the likelihood of delays and mistakes, we have taken several steps to prepare for success:\n\n1. This game project, as well as the Kickstarter campaign itself, are in the hands of two well-seasoned professionals. David MacKenzie has been running successful Kickstarter projects since 2010 (Alien Frontiers started the gaming frenzy on Kickstarter), and Isaias Vallejo comes from a digital games background as Executive Producer at Big Fish Games and has designed several successful tabletop games (Sunrise City and the \"Valeria\" series of games).\n\n2. We are dedicated to backer communication and feedback. Throughout every campaign, we are as transparent about the process and as open to feedback as possible without jeopardizing production and delivery timelines. Whether the news is good or bad, you can expect us to report it honestly and openly.\n\n3. We have done significant pre-production. All the art and graphic design for Horizons are completed with the exception of the stretch goals content. The art and design for the stretch goals content has been sketched out and is ready to push forward as soon as each goal is achieved.\n\n4. We are working with publishing partners in Germany, France, and Spain, to bring Horizons to a wide audience, expanding our economies of scale in production and logistics.\n\n5. We have our manufacturer lined up and ready to begin the pre-press process as soon as the files are delivered. We hope that everything goes as planned, but if something falls through the cracks, we are ready and willing to employ every tool at our disposal to get the project back on track and running smoothly.\n\nThank you for your support!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Premium PNP", "descp": "A Premium PNP PDF file with final print-ready rules and game components for the ENGLISH version of Horizons.

This Master will produce an Element Token every round that will be allocated to a Building.  \n  Each player gets to draft 3 permanent Artefacts at the beginning of the game. They sit on an extra player board provided with this expansion.\nEach of these Artefacts will provide powerful and asymmetric abilities to all players around the table.\n  In this expansion, we wanted to move the type of decision you make from \"attack vs defense\" strategy to a more elaborate combo-oriented thinking.\nMost Units now carry an extra function that can be activated using the Elements on your buildings!\n  At the beginning of the game, everyone is given a God randomly. If we manage to unlock more than the 4 base Gods, each player is actually given 2 Gods to choose from. The special effect of this God is immediately available as soon as you reach level 3!\n                                                                       Congratulation for unlocking Borr, father of Odin!\nLucky Duck Games Facebook Fan Page is here. \nLucky Duck Games Twitter Profile is here.\nVikings Gone Wild Official Facebook Forum is here.\n                             This pledge contains:\n   - Masters of Elements Expansion\n   - All Masters of Elements Stretch Goals Unlocked\n   - Money-back Guarantee\nThis pledge is ideal for someone who already bought the base game on Kickstarter or in retail and is looking for a deeper and more strategic experience of the game.\n  This pledge contains:   \n  - Vikings Gone Wild (Base Game - Retail Version)\n  - Masters of Elements Expansion\n  - All Masters of Elements Stretch Goals Unlocked\n  - Money-back Guarantee\nThis pledge is ideal for someone who has not bought the base game yet and wants to experience the most strategic experience this game has to offer.\nThe Base Game included in this pledge is the Retail Version, without any Kickstarter content from the first campaign.\n  This pledge contains:\n  - Vikings Gone Wild (Base Game - Retail Version)\n  - Masters of Elements Expansion\n  - It's a Kind of Magic Expansion\n  - Guild Wars Expansion\n  - Ragnarok Expansion (Solo/Coop experience)\n  - All Masters of Elements Stretch Goals Unlocked\n  - Money-back Guarantee\nGet yourself the full range of experiences this game system has to offer. From the spell oriented strategy of It's a Kind of Magic to the 2 vs 2 mode of the Guild Wars expansion, or as a cooperative/solo experience to survive the flow of the Undead Army in Ragnarok, you will get it all in its beautiful Viking Glory!\nThe Base Game included in this pledge is the Retail Version, without any Kickstarter content from the first campaign.\n     We are very excited to announce the release of 3 unique Booster Packs. Each pack is unique (no random cards) and always composed this way:  \n1x Divine Favor \n1x Artefact \n10x Unit Cards \nWe have built one pack per Element. We are leaving you the surprise to open them. Want to bet what is inside? :)\nPS: $12 gives you 3 Packs. That is all you need.\nPS2: These cards are unique and totally different from any cards we will offer you in Stretch Goal or in the expansion.\n   We heard it during the entire campaign: \"Give us the big box\" :D  \nWe wanted to make sure we would provide a box big enough to cover this expansion and any future ones (yes there could be more!). So we are producing a custom-sized box almost 2 times higher than the original box in order to contain everything:  \nAll cards.\nAll boards. \nAll tokens. \nAll rulebooks. \nAll neoprene boards (yes, you read right!).\nWe provide dividers by expansions and by type of cards, depending on the way you prefer to sort your cards!  \n  In Vikings Gone Wild, players take the role of heads of clans fighting against each other to prove to the gods who is the best.    \nDuring each turn, you play the cards in your hand to buy Units or Defense cards, erect Buildings and attack other players. You will have to find the right balance between investing in your economy (buildings, specials cards) and growing your army! \n     It's a Kind of Magic expansion introduces original core concepts through new Buildings, Units and a new type of card: Spells!    \n  It focuses on deck manipulation and will transform your experience of Vikings Gone Wild in a very interesting, magical, way!\n     Guild Wars expansion introduces new core concepts through new Buildings, Units and Defenses!    \n  A brand new 2 vs 2 mode is at the heart of this expansion, but most cards can be used in a regular game.\n    The Ragnarok expansion is a solo or cooperative expansion for Vikings Gone Wild.        \n  In order to win, you have to defeat the Undead Army before your time runs out! Will you be able to save us all? \n   This 1st Season Pack contains the 110 Kickstarter Exclusive cards of the previous Kickstarter! We saved you the price of the box (who needs boxes anyway) to put this pack at a very affordable price! \n     We have selected the perfect fit sleeves for you - BCW 58x89 Sleeves.\n\nAdding sleeves to a Kickstarter adds a fair layer of logistic complexity, but many struggled to find the right fit for this game before so we decided to do this for you. \n This add-ons won't add any shipping cost, no matter the quantity you pick or the pledge you select. \n $5 per pack of 100 Sleeves (2x50). \n $20 per pack of 500 Sleeves (10x50).\nCards quantities per game:\nBase Game: 220 cards\nIt's a Kind of Magic: 110 cards\nGuild Wars: 110 cards\nRagnarok: 55 cards\nKS 1st Season: 110 cards\n5th Viking: 55 cards\n3x Boosters: 36 cards\nMasters of Elements: 219 as of Stretch Goal #27, can we get the last one?\n  Many of you have asked for ways to upgrade their gears, and more specifically their player board! We love neoprene mats ourselves, so it did not take too much convincing to put us at work on the idea.  \nBringing these playmats to life, we wanted to bring something different enough that the upgrade would feel truly special. Mateusz spent some time redesigning our standard player pad and came up with 4 unique ones!\nThis add-on contains:\nx1 Thor Neoprene Playmat\nx1 Grendel Neoprene Playmat\nx1 Ragnar Neoprene Playmat\nx1 Valkyrie Neoprene Playmat\n  We first wanted to have both mats joined into one large play-mat. But looking at every single play-tests we ran, tables were never big enough to put the Artefact board on top or at the bottom of the base game player mat. So we decided to separate them to give the freedom of arranging your table the way you want!\nThis add-on contain:\n4x Masters of Elements Artefacts Neoprene Playmats\n  Many of you have asked for that 5th player expansion! It took us a while to find a proper way to include only a cardboard mat. Since we will include for free a 5th Artefact cardboard pad in the Master of Elements, you only need the base game player mat.\nThis add-ons contain:\n1x Base Game cardboard player mat.\n55 cards (including 1 Starting Deck, more Missions, Units, Defenses, Odin's Path, etc).\n  If you simply want to upgrade your 5th player to the full neoprene experience, this add-on is for you!\n1x Hel's Neoprene Playmat.\n1x Masters of Elements Artefact Neoprene Playmat.\n  How to add an Add-On to my pledge?\nIt depends if you already pledged or not.\nIf you didn't already pledged, then when you do, simply change the pledge amount. You just need to add to that amount the total cost of all the add-ons you want. For instance, if you want to pledge for the Masters of Elements Expansion alone at $35, but you also want to add one pack of 500 sleeves at $20, then you'll select the $35 pledge, and change the automatically filled up \"$35\" by 35 + 20 = \"$55\".\n If you want to add something to your pledge, then go to this page which lets you manage your pledge, and change the amount. You can do so by adding the total cost of all the add-ons you want. If you chose the $35 pledge for the Masters of Elements Expansion alone and decide to add one pack of 500 sleeves at $20, then change \"$35\" by 35 + 20 = \"$55\".\n                                               Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 notre distributeur Atalia, qui s'occupe de la livraison de tous les jeux Vikings Gone Wild en France et en Belgique, nous pouvons offrir les frais de port pour la France et la Belgique dans certaines conditions.

All we need is your support!!!\nWhat Are Bones Gaming Miniatures?\nBones are only the best high-quality plastic gaming models to hit the industry in the last decade. Inexpensive, high quality, soft gaming models that are easy and fun to paint and won't break when you actually use them for games! \n  All Backers must use the Reaper Pledge Manager to select their rewards and provide shipping information\n          ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhat are the risks and challenges that come with completing your project, and how are you qualified to overcome them?\n\nPRODUCTION AND FULFILLMENT\n\nFor a project like ours, the risks and challenges fall into three categories: \n1) Overall Non-completion \n2) Delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates \n3) We do not produce a specific model or change a specific model\n\nConcerning the risk of Overall Non-completion: we've already completed several massive Kickstarters and are fully aware of the pitfalls. Two things that could cause the non-completion of this Kickstarter are either the loss of our inbound shipments (due to an act of God, pirates or war), or a massive disaster (fire, flood) that levels our facility. Either of those events might be disastrous, however we carry full insurance on our facility and insure every shipment, no matter the size, against loss and damage.\n\nObviously either of the above tragic events would create delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates, and that brings us to the second category: delays. We have learned a lot from our Kickstarters. However, delays are simply part of the cycle of business and it is our wisdom, training, and experience that would help us mitigate and work through any delay. Some delays, like ones we have control or exercise input over, are easy to solve. Other delays are out of our control, such as US Customs and Border Protection and Consumer Product Safety Commission inspections and delays. In the end we do everything possible to avoid any delay and will always update you as soon as possible.\n\nLastly there is the risk we will not produce a specific model shown. This will only occur if there is not enough interest in a specific model measured by the number of backers that actually pledge for to buy it verses the cost to produce it. This event has never occurred in any of our previous Kickstarters, but is nonetheless still a risk. In the event this situation develops you will have plenty of time to adjust your Pledge Manager.\n\nWe reserve the right to modify pieces shown to meet production requirements.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nIf it is with within 14 days of the closing of this Kickstarter we will refund your entire pledge amount. After 14 days, but before the closing of this Kickstarter\u2019s Reaper Pledge Manager, we will refund your entire pledge minus the 10% Kickstarter and Processing Fees we incur. Once the Reaper Pledge Manager closes, refund requests are subject to review and not all requests may be honored. \n \nYOUR BACKER RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS KICKSTARTER\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge in the Reaper Pledge Manager by July 31 2018 you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after July 31, 2018. \n\nUnconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics. If you confirm your pledge late (after July 31, 2018) some items may not still be available. This means that part, if not all, of your rewards may not be available and/or your pledge may be forfeit. \n\nYou are responsible for all fees associated with the transit and acceptance by you to complete delivery. These include, but are not limited to: import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant and taxing authorities, VAT and GST due and delivery acceptance, brokerage and collection charges. \n\nYou are required to provide correct address information and ensure this address is deliverable by normal methods before your rewards are shipped.\n\nYou must have your address correct and up to date in the Reaper Pledge Manager when we announce shipping is beginning. You may change it at any time until then. There may be a shipping surcharge associated with changing countries.\n\nRewards returned to us as undeliverable will be shipped again postage prepaid by the Backer. \n\nALL OFFICIAL COMMUNICATIONS FOR THIS KICKSTARTER WILL BE VIA KICKSTARTER UPDATES ONLY.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Europe, Africa, Middle East, Russia", "descp": "2017 Bones 4 PLEDGE LEVEL This reward level pledges enough to get you into this Bones 4 Kickstarter.

If you\u2019re already a fan, now is the time to complete your collection!\nIf you have been waiting for the opportunity to get in on Cthulhu Wars, this is your best opportunity!\nCthulhu Wars is a competitive strategy game in which 2 to 8 players face-off to determine the fate of the planet. You'll recruit cultists and summon monsters, cast spells, open interdimensional gates, and awaken your colossal unearthly Great Old One!\nEvery game is different - as you play, you unlock new spellbooks, giving new amazing powers unique to each faction. Play is asymmetric - every faction has a unique set of rules and victory conditions.\nThe core game offers an asymmetric, two to four player strategy experience (up to eight players with expansions). Each player controls a faction of cosmic evil competing with its rivals for the remains of the defeated, dying Earth. Players push and battle each other to control areas, build gates, gain power, achieve personal goals, and unlock special abilities in the form of spellbooks to render their own faction supreme. The miniatures are conspicuously monstrous, appealing and evocative. \n                                                                                                                                                                                    Arthur said click a link.

Cthulhu Wars is a large, heavy, board game (about 5kg or 11lbs). The shipping prices reflect this.\n  For most regions, including Europe, the VAT and any import taxes are included in the shipping cost. There are some countries in which we cannot include import taxes. These include Central and South America, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Turkey, UAE, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Taiwan. If this changes and we are able to pay for your import taxes on your behalf, we will update you, but we cannot do so at this time.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is not our first Kickstarter.

That\u2019s it! Cards can be played as treasure or as an action. Every card has a different ability, and the first player to reach 21 treasure is the winner.\nNinjitsu! is fully compatible with Scuttle! - just shuffle the two games together and you're ready to go! Itintroduces hidden treasures, which are played face-down in front of you. These can be stolen by your opponents, but watch out! Some hidden treasures are trapped; swipe the wrong card, and pay the consequences!\nCheck out the free print-and-play!\nEveryone who gets the game through Kickstarter will also be sent a special promo card: Jellybean Ninja. \nThis colorful character lets you guess what treasure you\u2019re stealing. If you\u2019re correct, you are rewarded with a great bounty!\nOur stretch goals will unlock other promo cards as well - check out the stretch goal chart below! \nLike all Jellybean Games, Ninjitsu! is simple enough for young gamers to enjoy, but with enough strategy to engage grown-ups as well. The hidden treasures add a unique bluffing element to the game and keep everyone engaged at all times. \nIs that treasure going to guarantee your opponent victory...or is it a carefully laid trap? There\u2019s only one way to find out! \nThe Traps! expansion offers 14 new cards, including a whole new type of trap: cards with long-lasting effects! Stealing treasure has never been so risky, with new traps which prevent you from drawing, swiping, or even playing hidden treasures of your own!\nWith more treasure, more ninjas (the fiendish Master of Tricks, the devious Master Thief, and the dastardly Master of Escape) and more ways to bamboozle your opponents, this Ninjitsu! expansion will totally change the way you play the game. \nAn ancient grimoire has been uncovered, unleashing the secrets of elemental magic! These 15 cards add a unique twist to the game, and can be shuffled into any game of Ninjitsu! OR Scuttle! to add a little magic touch.\nGive yourself the power of Flight, Alchemy, Healing, and more! The magical tome\u2019s abilities will leave your opponents stunned as you duplicate your cards, transmute treasures, and invisibly steal their cards\u2026\nCombining either Traps! or the Supernatural expansion with Ninjitsu! adds the fourth suit to the game, which means the game can be used as a standard deck of playing cards.\nSeize the powers of the elements with these unique player abilities! Master the forces of nature to crush your opponents.\nAt the start of each game, each player is dealt an element - they choose which of the two elemental powers to use and play the rest of the game with that ability.\nWill you use the powers of Fire to protect your treasure, or to steal cards from your opponents? Will your Earthly abilities give you a boost at the start of the game, or grow your treasures? Will the power of Heart be enough to overcome your opponents?

As you can see from the review copies, the game is fully designed, the rules rule, and the art is all complete; all we want now is your help to print the game and distribute it around the world.\nNinjitsu! is the fifth project from Jellybean Games. The company was formed to bring you awesome experiences for gamer kids (and their parents) which can also be enjoyed by the wider gaming community.\nOur aim is to make games for kids that grown-ups love.\nAll the money we raise will go towards making Ninjitsu! even better, and furthering development on all our future games.\nIf you like the game, please support the project (every dollar helps!) and tell your friends...especially if they have kids, know kids, love kids, or love great games and gorgeous art!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur first game, Scuttle!, delivered on-time to most backers (and only slightly late to the rest). \nOur second game, Dracula\u2019s Feast, is now shipping.\nOur third game, The Lady and the Tiger, is about to hit the printer.\n\nWe have learned a lot of valuable lessons from our first few campaigns, and we are confident that this game will arrive by the anticipated delivery date at the very latest.

This game was inspired by my love of animals and food. I created \"bite me cutie\" as a way to bring awareness to endangered animal species. Each character aka CUTIE has a story that comes from the heart... My heart.\n  Every design from \"bite me cutie\" is created and designed by, Thien Vuong. They all have a cute lore.\n  Every game package comes with 3 decks: \"CUTIE DECK\", \"FLAVOR DECK\", & \"EFFECT DECK\". The goal of the game is to collect the most cuties by the end of the game, the player with the highest tallied cutie class points wins!\n   OFFICIAL HOUSE RULES:\n* At the beginning of your turn draw one card out of the FLAVOR DECK & EFFECT DECK.\n* When your turn ends say \"Done\" to let the other players know that your turn is over.\n* Players can have a maximum of 10 cards in hand, every card after that must be discarded until you have only 10 cards in hand.\n* When it's your turn you can use as many EFFECT CARDS & COLLECT as many cuties as you can afford. STRATEGIZE!\n* When you COLLECT a CUTIE it is replaced by another CUTIE CARD from the CUTIE DECK. Rinse & repeat until all CUTIES are COLLECTED.\n* When a cutie's bite point is reduced to zero its' class points will not count until healed by a buff card.\n* Each deck has a discard pile next to them, once you run out of cards from the respected decks shuffle the discard pile to have a new deck to draw from.\n* The player with the highest class points wins! They become titled the \"Cutie Chef\" for this battle.\n* If any players have the same amount of class points the player with the most cuties & and matching flavors win!\n* When the last cutie card is collected no more cards can be drawn from the deck and everyone has one last turn to deal out their trap and buff cards to knockout and heal their cuties. Trap cards that bring cuties back to field are negated.\n STORY LORE.\nIn the not so distant future, a world where many animals have faced extinction, over poaching, and harsh environment, exists \"bite me cutie\". Cuties are creatures made from the SPIRAL DNA of animals long gone by imprinting the DNA traits of that animal into what ever object the spiral DNA is placed on. The first CUTIE was created when our mascot \"CUTIE\" aka a slice of cheese pizza was infused with a happy trait. After that humans went over and beyond experimenting with infinite combinations to make all kinds of cuties in order to cope with the loss of real animals in their current age. Though a few animals have survived throughout the ages, things have only gotten harder for these animals fighting near extinction. That's why we have to fight to preserve these animal and cuties to alter history. Learn what you need in order to collect cuties and help them grow and live. \nThat's right, this game is about animal preservation, BAM! Didn't see that coming.... right?\nBe the first to have access to our exclusive merch! All pledges above $10 unlocks the ADD-ON SHOP! Shirts, posters, & more to add a lil'extra CUTE to your collections. :)\n       INTRODUCING \"THE CHEFS\" YOUTUBE COLLABS YOUTUBERS: \nRealTDragon - D-Piddy - Caleb Hyles - BeatDownBoogie\nStarting from a sketch pad > to Illustrator > to After Effects > back to Illustrator for the final deck. So many steps, right? Overall each card takes about 10 hours to make individually, from early stage sketches to final story & card design. Now just multiply that by 70+ cards and you have \"bite me cutie\"! Hours of my life devoted to something that I hope won't disappoint you.\nTHE ORIGIN STORY.  \nHello my name is Thien Vuong and I'm an artist. I've been making online video content on the \"RealTDragon\" Youtube Channel for the past 6 years, and through this project I wanted to showcase that anything is possible if you can dedicate your heart and mind to it. Designing and creating illustrated characters was never in my skill set but through creating this passion project, \"bite me cutie\", I was able to build my skills as an artist. Through persistent grit, I made my dream of becoming a well versed graphic artist a tangible goal. Inspired to create cute animal and food designs inspired by the kawaii/chibi art style and culture of Japan! Before this project, roughly starting December 2016, I could barely sketch out my ideas. However, after spending thousands of hours to make \"bite me cutie\", I can confidently say that I have achieved something I would never have been capable of otherwise. \"bite me cutie\" is a reminder to myself and to other creators to never limit yourself, don't make imaginary boundaries... Just do what makes you happy. <3 \nHELP US MAKE THIS A REALITY.  \nThis has been an on-going passion project for me that I feel could really be a great way to spend time with friends, family, and people you've just met. You can play \"bite me cutie\" anywhere, whether it be at a friend gathering, card game night, Anime & Comic Conventions, or pizza party. I felt that the Kickstarter community and platform would be a great way to gauge interest for \"bite me cutie\" and allow me to send the package straight to you!\nAll the cards are custom designed, sized, and each deck will have over 100+ cards. My initial goal for this project is to raise $5,000 in order to fulfill the minimum quantities to start producing the cards at top notch quality. 75% goes to production costs, 15% goes straight back to your rewards, & 10% are to pay the rest of the payments and fees.\nGet a shout out on our Social Media! Be featured on our website! Be a cutie!\nNot mandatory, but some fun goals to reach. When all are achieved a special gift will be placed in all $20+ pledges. :)\nSpecial Thanks:\n\u2764 Much love in appreciation to everyone that helped inspire me and help get this project going!

If we meet our goal, the bite me cutie card game (with the original backer rewards) will be put into production immediately! To get to you as soon as possible. The process takes approximately 2-3 months for production to complete and 1-2 months to ship all items to our warehouse. Approximately being able to be in your hands this summer!  As soon as the card game and reward items are in hand we will make multiple announcements here and on all social media and shipments will begin. Additional Stretch Goals? Any funds that are over our original goal amount will be used to fund our stretch goals. All funds beyond that will be reinvested into future \"bite me cutie\" projects.\nSHARE THIS PROJECT ON SOCIAL MEDIA! :)\nFacebook - Twitter - Google Plus", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAny risk for the campaign is difficult to think of. All the art for the card game has already been completed and now simply waiting to reach the goal. Once successful the cards will be printed and sent out accordingly as well as, shirts, pins, posters, and plushies! That being said, \u201cMurphy's Law\u201d (Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong) could possibly occur. From printing and manufacturing delays, products getting lost in the shipping process, or human error ending in something not being sent.\n\nI will be working hard to cater to our Kickstarter backers.

The total funding goal equals the sum of both campaigns. For more details see March 19th Update.\n                                           The Hill hides many treasures and all it takes to collect them is to DIG! However, these are not the only things the Hill hides... Creatures and traps await, the galleries you will create might either mean wealth or despair.  \nDelve into the hill and gather ten gems to win the game! Take some risks, push your luck, hire recruits to dig deeper and win favours of companions (Knight, Wizard, Scout, Hunter...) to protect your galleries from the many creatures (Thieves, Skeletons, Orcs..) and traps the Hill hides.  \nDIG finds its path between adventure, strategy, luck and resource management. In this card-driven game for 2 to 4 players ages 10 and up, fun meets strategy, luck meets roleplaying and fantasy meets pixel art design within 20 to 45 minutes.  \nDIG is easy to learn. It is a great game if you are looking for adventure in an universe filled with eye-catching 8-bit graphics.\nDIG was designed with the following principles: keep the mechanics simple, mix strategy and push-your-luck, propose a fantasy RPG atmosphere and give the game a retro look from the NES golden age. The result is a neat game which has received great reviews all around the globe. While easy to learn, DIG will challenge you to take some risks in order to enjoy it to the fullest. Whether you choose to dig carefully alone or gather as many Precious Stones as you can to hire a Companion, the game will always feel different each time you will play it. With your help, I intend to give the game more depth and add a competitive aspect with the addition of new trick cards, creatures and bonuses that will extend the already entertaining gameplay.\n        In addition to the core game I also designed a playmat. This mat is absolutely not mandatory to play the game, I created it because I love to play games on a board and I think some of you might like boards and playmats as much as I do. It matches perfectly the pixel-art design of the cards. The mat will be made of thick neoprene rubber and will allow up to 4 players to dig in dedicated cards slots. Companions will fit and sit nicely at the Tavern's tables and, of course, each player will have room to keep the cards and Gems she has collected.\n      DISCLAIMER: the following videos were made with prototypes (see \"We did it\" update fur further details) - cards sizes and components quality are below the final product's.\nHow to play video ENG by Bearded Meeple\nHow to play video FR provided by \n   How to play video GER\n  1. \"Dig\" by drawing one card at a time\n2. Collect the Precious Stones\n3. Hire a Recruit for 5 Crystals \n4. Put your Recruit on a card to start a Gallery\n*Whenever you place a Recruit, draw another card right after and add to it the Gallery!\n5. When your turn comes choose either to \"dig\" in your Gallery(ies) - add one card per Gallery you own... or choose to \"dig\" aside from them an either collect the card drawn or choose to place a Recruit on it to start a new Gallery.\n6. For each set of 5 cards a Gallery creates a Gem!\nWhen your turn comes you can choose either to\"dig\" aside from your Gallery(ies), close one of your Galleries (i.e. retreive everything in it) or push your luck and try to create more Gems and even to draw special cards...\n7. Some will make your Gallery(ies) wealthier...\n8. ...but other can mean despair.\n9. Dig faster and safer by hiring one or several Companions with unique abilities!\n The first player to gather 10 Gems wins the game and becomes THE KING OF THE HILL!\n          The core game contains quite some cards - over 140! - but, with your help I'd like to add some more! Not just to acheive a higher Hill, but also to add new mechanics, new trick cards and more Companions - in short: to extend the gameplay!\n    The following are honest, unpayed and unbiased reviews.

Therefore, I started my micro-enterprise to handle every legal aspect of the creation and the paperwork, playtested my ideas a lot and figured out that the time had come for me to make one step forward. So here I am, submitting my very first game to you. Well, actually I did a first Kickstarter for DIG but I decided to cancel it since there were a few things I did not take in consideration. \nLuckily, I met Daniel from Board Game Circus who offered his help and support to rise a new campaign. He and his teammate Alexander have given me great advice on how to avoid traps and how to build a great project from start to finish.   \nSo here I am - really excited about your feedback and ready to work my ass off to improve the game with your help! In the end, my biggest wish is to succeed in this project so that I can give you more of them. Thank you if you choose to back my project, thank you if you read so far, thank you for taking the time to wonder what DIG is about!\n    Please note that prices other than Euros (\u20ac) are estimated according to the exchange rate available at the time the campaign was launched.\n    Check out Board Game Circus' website for more details on board game marketing, promotion and other services they provide!\n  Stay tuned, subscribe to my social media channels and receive exclusive news on DIG's development and upcoming Mangrove Games projects!\n                                                         ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSince this is my first project, I might face some unforeseen issues.

When she's not convincing strangers to playtest spacecat-themed board games, you can find her knitting, sewing, or spinning yarn. Her games have been featured on the League of Gamemakers and on both seasons of Tabletop Deathmatch.\n Pete Butler-Davis Co-Game Designer Rocket Cats in Space!\n  MARK SIERENS Big Bossman\nMark's gaming background starts way back in 1983 when his mother brought home his first game system the Atari 2600. He has been gaming ever since. Mark has owned every console system released since then - even a Turbografx 16. He started MMOs with Dark Sun Online on the TEN network. He beta tested Ever Quest. He has played almost every MMO released since then. Mark started with tabletop gaming in 1994 with an excursion into Magic: The Gathering and Dungeons & Dragons. This started a love affair with tabletop gaming that has lasted until this day.  \nEach Saturday he host game day in his home where his game group play games from a variety of genres. His love of gaming is one reason why Vile Genius Games was formed to bring fun, interesting, and exciting games to the world. Corrupting a few minds in the process doesn\u2019t hurt either.\n   MANNY AGUILERA ART DIRECTOR  \nManny has illustrated for many high end clients including Disney, and Carnival Cruise Lines. His illustrations have been used on everything from vehicle wraps, t-shirts, and promo items as well as advertising and packaging. When he's not drawing for clients, he's lending his artistic talents to causes like St. Jude's and the American Cancer Society for all different kinds of fundraising efforts.

We use Kickstarter updates and social media to keep you as informed as possible as to the status of your items. However, in this business, some uncertain and ever-changing factors are beyond our control, such as holiday work schedules, customs, quality control, inspection delays, inclement weather and dock strikes and few other issues. Try as we might, we have little to no control over these issues. However, we assure you that you will be the first to know if any delays are going to happen, as we learn them.\n\nWe ship your item or items to you through various fulfillment partners located around the world. We do this to keep expenses as low as possible and we pass those savings on to you. That is why we offer great shipping rates on our projects. \n\nWe reserve the right to combine the shipping of any and all products for multiple projects if the shipping runs close to the same time and we feel we can ship them within a reasonable time frame (30 days) of our fulfillment center receiving them. If there is going to be a delay shipping for this reason we will notify you as soon as possible. You will always have the right to pay additional fees to get expedited delivery on orders once they have been received by the fulfillment warehouse.\n\nEven though we work with excellent fulfillment partners, shipping issues, while uncommon, can sometimes occur. Our quality control team double-checks each product for damage before sending them out. However, there is a small chance that your items may get damaged during shipping. If your package is damaged, please contact us so we can assist you.\n\nThere are some areas we\u2019re unable to ship to without making special arrangements.

As the Kami descend from the heavens to reshape the land in their image, it is up to each player to lead their clan to victory. Use politics to further your cause, negotiate to seek the most profitable alliances, worship the Kami to gain their favor, recruit monsters out of legend to bolster your forces, and use your resources wisely to be victorious in battle. \nHere's a look at everything included in a base pledge:\nAnd all the Optional Buys you can get:\nClick to learn more about Dynasty Invasion, Playmat Board, Art Book, and Metal Coins.\nCreated by acclaimed designer Eric M. Lang, Rising Sun reunites the same creative forces responsible for the smash hit Blood Rage, with stunning artwork by Adrian Smith and intricate miniatures sculpted under the direction of Mike McVey.\nChoose your clan: Koi, Dragonfly, Bonsai, Lotus or Turtle.\nEach of the five clans in Rising Sun brings not only their own individual set of ten beautifully detailed miniatures for their Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi units, but also a unique ability that sets them apart from the others and affects all players' strategies.\nKoi (Flow, Like Water) - Ever adaptable, the Koi clan is able to use hired Ronin as coins and vice versa, giving them great flexibility and making their decisions very unpredictable.\nKoi Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi.\nDragonfly (Wings, Wind and Spirit) - Flying on gossamer wings, the Dragonfly clan is able to move anywhere on the map without restriction. You never know where they'll strike next.\nDragonfly Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi.\nBonsai (Humility, Earth and Root) - Ever growing and evergreen, the Bonsai clan needs to spend no coins when buying resources. Strongholds sprout from the ground and Upgrades to the clan blossom naturally.\nBonsai Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi.\nLotus (Patience is key) - The Lotus clan dictates the flow of politics by turning the Political Mandates they play into anything they wish. A powerful ally to have at your side, and a terrible foe to betray.\nLotus Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi.\nTurtle (Hard as the mind; delicate as steel) - The Turtle clan builds their Strongholds on top of the shells of giant legendary turtles. These indestructible fortresses can move around the map and even join in the fights for the provinces.\nTurtle Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi.\nPlayed over the course of a year, each Season in Rising Sun is divided into a Political phase, where players prepare their clans and set their plans in motion, and a War Phase, where dominance over each of the contested provinces is decided.\nThe Political Mandates.\nDuring the Political phase, players choose among a restricted selection for a Political Mandate to play. These determine the actions all players may perform. They can Recruit new units on their Strongholds, Marshal their forces across the map, Train to upgrade their clan with Season cards, Harvest to reap the rewards of the provinces they dominate, or even Betray their ally to bring opposing forces to their side.\nWhen players perform a Train Political Mandate, they are able to spend their coins to upgrade their clans with Season cards that bring all manner of new abilities. From Virtues that give you bonuses according to your actions, to Enhancements that improve your clan, to powerful Monsters that may join your clan, bringing with them amazing strength or other more devious benefits.\nKomainu, Yurei and Oni of Spite.\nOni of Skulls and Oni of Souls.\nOni of Hate and Oni of Blood.\nRiver Dragon (all monsters are to scale with this human figure).\nThe miniatures shown are resins. All miniatures in Rising Sun will be pre-assembled plastic.\nAlliances are formed. Alliances are broken.\nAt the start of each Season, players engage in a tea ceremony to negotiate new Alliances. Having the right ally and playing for mutual benefit (for a time) is often key to victory. Allies don't kill each other during war, and they also grant each other a unique bonus whenever they play a Political Mandate. Recruit extra units, build Strongholds when you Marshal, save coins when you Train, and reap a bountiful Harvest. However, the enticing Betrayal option always casts a shadow of doubt over Alliances.\nDo not be too quick to Betray your ally, though, for such an action brings dishonor to your clan. Honor is a tangible force in Rising Sun. Clans are always competing on a ladder for who is more or less honorable than the other. Having more Honor than your opponent gives you the upper hand on any ties in the game, from a dispute when worshipping a Kami, to deadly war on the provinces. But occasionally being dishonorable might also be a valid strategy, for upgrades such as the nightmarish Oni often favor those at the bottom of the Honor scale.\nThe Kami await the worshippers.\nWhen players Recruit their forces, they may choose to send their Shinto warriors to climb the mountains and go worship the mighty Kami. Three times per Season, each of these gods will grant their blessing upon the clan who worships them the most. The competition for the grace of the Kami can become fierce and change the course of the game. Each Kami grants a different benefit, from increased Honor, to extra Bushi, Ronin or coins. Only four of the seven Kami are used in each game, creating different dynamics each time you play.\nEach Season ends with the War phase. In each of the contested provinces, the warring players secretly bid their coins on the different War Advantages. Only the winner in each of the different options is allowed to execute them, allowing for dramatic shifts in the outcome of each battle, or cunning players coming out ahead even in defeat. Bluff your way through impossible odds and trick your opponents into needlessly wasting their coins. Sometimes losing a battle may win you the war.\nWhen Winter comes, all politics and fighting are over. Players gain extra points for winning battles in as many different provinces as possible, and also for certain upgrades they may have gathered. As the snow falls, the new Emperor will ascend! \nGame Components:\n58 Highly Detailed Miniatures, including 10 warriors for each clan and 8 huge monsters.\n40 Counter Bases\n137 Tokens\n5 Clan Screens\n5 Political Sheets\n53 Cards\n6-fold Gameboard\n1 Rulebook\nYou can take a look at the Work In Progress Rulebook HERE.\nFor $100 the Daimyo Pledge gets you a Rising Sun core game as well as the Kickstarter Exclusive Phoenix monster, and any stretch goals we manage to unlock!\nThe Phoenix comes with its amazing miniature and Season card. \nThe Phoenix has otherworldly powers of resurrection. Whenever it is killed, it automatically reappears in the same province and raises the honor of its clan.\nNote that anything marked with this:\nis an Exclusive item for Kickstarter backers, with remaining stock available at conventions and special promotions only. \nThe honorable CMON crew gathered to play a session of Rising Sun.

We'll sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed and we've sent out our Pledge Manager.\nPlease Take Note!\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$15 to most states. $30 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.\nCANADA: $10-$20 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $50-$60 to most countries.\nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $30 to most other countries (we can't predict an estimate cost to Malaysia).\nOCEANIA: $13-$25 to Australia. $30 to New Zealand.\nAFRICA: $80 to most countries.\nEUROPE: $15-$30 to most countries.\n  $35 to Norway, Finland, Estland, Lettland, and Latvia.\n  $40 to Bosnia/Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia.\n  $55 to Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Romania.\n  $60 to Iceland and Israel.\n  $70 to Greece and Turkey.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs from some specific countries have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to them.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available in conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\nTo learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 26th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as: \nProduction delays \nShipping delays \nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is April 2018, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely. We've successfully delivered Zombicide, Sedition Wars, Guilds of Cadwallon, Zombicide Season 2, Relic Knights, Rivet Wars, Kaosball, Dogs of War, Arcadia Quest, Wrath of Kings, XenoShyft, our Base System, Zombicide Season 3, The World of Smog: On Her Majesty's Service, Rum & Bones, Blood Rage, B-Sieged, Zombicide: Black Plague, The Others, XenoShyft: Dreadmire and Masmorra: Dungeons of Arcadia. We have almost completed the delivery of Arcadia Quest: Inferno, and are halfway through with delivering Rum & Bones: Second Tide.\n\nWe have two ongoing projects currently: Massive Darkness, which is in production, and The World of Smog: Rise of Moloch, which is being prepared for production.\n\nPlease refer to our individual project pages if you'd like to check the progress there. Each project is entirely independent from each other, has completely different development teams, and has no effect on the production flow or development of Rising Sun.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

The miniatures will be offered in Standard full teams of 18 to 20 players or Deluxe teams with 23 to 25 miniatures (Standard team with 5 Star Players). Here are the team and pack selections for the KickStater.\nMETAL TEAMS\nELF - The Standard metal Elf team has the same miniatures as the Standard resin Elf team.   The Deluxe version adds metal versions of Eldril, Hubris, Dolfar, Moranion and Jordell to the Standard team.  The Ultimate version adds metal versions of Eldril, Hubris, Dolfar, Moranion, Jordell, Horkon, Ithaca, Roxanne, 2 Dark Elf Assassins and 2 Dark Elf Witches to the Standard team.\nDARK ELF - The Standard metal Dark Elf team has the same miniatures as the Standard resin Dark Elf team.   The Deluxe version adds metal versions of Eldril, Hubris, Horkon, Ithaca and Roxanne to the Standard team.\nAMAZON - The Standard metal Amazon team has the same miniatures as the Standard resin Amazon team.   The Deluxe version adds in the 5 star players.\nRESIN TEAMS\nAMAZON TEAM  (20 players team) - (25 players for Deluxe)  \n(see Update #1 for an image of the Amazonian Giantess added for free to the Standard Amazon team with Stretch Goal #1)\n   ELF TEAM (18 player team) - (23 players for Deluxe)\nDARK ELF TEAM (18 player team) - (23 player if Deluxe)\nULTIMATE ELF TEAM (30 player team)\nThe miniatures in these three teams is a completely new resin and mold release that we just started using in 2017.   It is a better material than we have used in the past and can be primed with any primer!   We also purchased a state of the art high end 3-D printer to make the new master copies of the minis in these teams and even the mold material and the spin casting machine are new.  So these teams are designed to be the best for materials available on the market.\nThe miniatures all come with bases and are provided unpainted. The miniatures will require light clean up and some assembly (although several models are one piece). Impact! Miniatures has created several KickStarters and delivered to all backers on all our previous KickStarters so bid with confidence. We are keeping this KickStarter small and focused so that we can quickly produce the teams and get them shipped out on time.\nADD-ONS\nDark Elf Star Player Pack ($14)\nElf Star Player Pack ($14)\nIndividual Elf Miniatures\nPack of 16 30mm slotted bases (these work with old (28mm scale) and new (32mm scale) miniatures and old and new playing boards) - $10\nNOTE on shipping: Shipping options are displayed when you pledge for a reward. Shipping is $5 to the USA, $10 to Canada and $15 to all other locations.\nSTRETCH GOAL #0 - Backers who back in the first 24 hours of the project will receive a free Gridiron Ball Ring and a D11 die (for randomly picking a player on the field)\nDISCLAIMER and spincast resin details: Specs: Spincast resin is a hard (75D) heat resistant plastic resin. You might find some small bubbles on the underneath side of the miniatures from the spincast process but we do our best to keep them away from the miniature. Spincast resin is much harder, and tougher, than normal resin. Spincast resin can withstand 320F, and can handle prolonged exposure at 150F with ease (so our Australian friends should not have any problems during the summer). It can be super-glued together, and takes standard miniature paints easily after priming. Safety: Spincast resin is very safe ... so why you ask do we include a safety section to our KickStarter? We had a person buy a Spincast resin figure from one of our KickStarters and stick it into direct flame over his kitchen stove to \"soften\" it so he could modify it. As would be expected with any item you stick into flame ... it caught fire ... which resulted in him reporting the product to the United States Consumer Product Saftey Commission and us promising that on all future sales we would make sure we tell our customers to please not light their toys on fire. So here goes: Spincast resin should never be exposed to direct flame. Other than this, Spincast resin has no special safety precautions, the dust in non- carcinogenic. However: all material dusts will irritate the lining of the lungs, and make existing conditions worse, so we recommend wearing a dust mask. Better safe than sorry! Spincast resin is safe to expose to INDIRECT heat. Unlike many plastics (PVC etc.) it does not give off toxic vapors. Heating Spincast resin to 320F from indirect heat is safe (say on a piece of foil on a cookie sheet in an oven), and a good way to soften the material in order to reposition/bend parts (then plunge into cold water to set). AGAIN DO NOT EXPOSE Spincast resin to an open flame. Heck.. don't expose any resin or plastic toy from any company to direct flame. It is just a REALLY bad idea okay.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are few risks on the project.

We had an accessible worker placement game that mixed some of our favorite gameplay elements rolled up in a theme that is ridiculously fun and perfectly integrated with mechanics.  I love games that have simple mechanics that lead to incredibly tense decisions. Like a dice pool as a resource (DNA), set-collection, turn-efficiency, a clever auction mechanic, and extremely tense decisions about where to spend your time and energy?  Yes, please!  You can also focus on upgrading your laboratory to make dinosaur creation more efficient.  But if you do, it means you're spending less time on opening new rides.  And the constant pressure to keep your guests safe while still turning a profit every season creates interesting decision making on players. It\u2019s a nail biter, for sure.\n   Dinosaur Island is a unique worker placement game with a combination of fascinating mechanics that is unlike anything you have ever seen.\nSCALABLE GAME LENGTH: One of our favorite aspects of the game is the scalable length mechanism that can change the length of the game from sixty minutes to two and a half hours.  Regardless of player count!  If you're looking for a shorter game at the end of the night or the main course of a game-night, Dinosaur Island has you taken care of.  \nWe also have a unique mechanic we call the \"Plot-Twist\".  At the beginning of every game two Plot-Twist cards will be dealt out that will break the rules of the game in myriad ways.  These rule-changes will drastically alter your strategy and decision making throughout the game.  No memorizing the optimal strategy here.  Dinosaur Island will keep even the most experienced gamer on their toes each time.  In addition to the Plot Twists, the goal cards in each game will be unique, creating a totally different feel to each and every game of Dinosaur Island you play.  Familiar mechanics and new strategy welcome you each time you sit at the table.\n       The Deluxe edition comes with everything you see above plus shiny metal coins, special Spot UV on the box, metallic ink on the box, a special numbered edition, and it will never be reproduced for sale again.  This will be your only chance to get your hands on the delectable, chrome Deluxe edition of Dinosaur Island!  \nThere will also be some very special stretch goals as the campaign continues that we hope to add exclusively to the deluxe edition of the game.  These include custom components that are too expensive to add to the regular edition of the game\u2014we can\u2019t wait to show them to y\u2019all!\n\u00b7         74 metal coins (50x1 copper, 24x5 gold!)\n\u00b7         Spot UV printing on the box\n\u00b7         Metallic ink on the box\n\u00b7         Individual Numbering\n\u00b7         Exclusive Stretch Goals throughout the campaign!\nSample images, final design of metallic ink, spot UV and metal coins pending!\n  We at Pandasaurus Games have a unique view of art direction.  Find amazing artists that you want to work with, give them an idea of the crazy we have in our heads, and trust their vision.  In this case we were incredibly lucky to bring on Peter Wocken (graphic design Dead of Winter, Xia) and Kwanchai Moriya (illustrations Catacombs, Kodoma) and work with them to create this beautifully bonkers art look that evokes the feelings of late 80s/early 90s graphic design.\nYou know, back when dinosaurs were amazing scale covered multi-colored terror lizards.  Not dumb birds with feathers.  We wanted to go back to our own childhood and bring out the colors, patterns (oh, the patterns!) and feeling of sitting down and playing a game of Sim City to the look and feel of the game.\nWe leaned heavily on collectible card games, old board game design and specifically the artwork of Paper Girls (which is an amazing comic that you should all be reading).  We couldn't be happier with the way the game looks.  It\u2019s bright colors, really fun art and a sense of really living in the world that Peter and Kwanchai created.  It doesn't look like all the other board games out there, and we are really happy that it doesn't.\n                                                                                                      These are all the stretch goals we had planned for throughout the campaign.  We've got some great ideas for the expansion, but for now, this is it!\n                                                                                                                                            Warning:  Vertical Video!\n      Pandasaurus Games will be working with partners to deliver the game worldwide.  This project will be EU, Canada, China, US and Australia friendly!  \nAfter the campaign ends, we will be charging actual shipping costs less 10 dollars per game.  We want to strike a fair balance of value for our backers while ensuring high quality fair shipping prices for each backer.  By shipping within the EU, Australia, China, Canada and the United States we are hoping to get as favorable of shipping rates as possible.  We will be working with well-vetted partners in each region who have experience with Kickstarter reward fulfillment and come highly recommended by other publishers within the industry, and will take into account good (and bad) experiences that other publishers have experienced.\nOur goal is for the average shipping costs for backers in the EU (inclusive of the UK unless Theresa May really gets to it), US, Canada, Australia and China to be under 20 USD with shipping for backers outside of these regions to come from the most cost-effective area for the lowest possible shipping price.\nWe are charging 25 dollars for shipping during the campaign for international backers, and will refund any difference to you after the campaign ends.  Some backers in remote areas may have to pay additionally above this amount, but our goal is to not surprise people with shipping charges and wanted to be up front about potential costs.

We are confident in our ability to deliver the rewards listed and on time.\n\nThe game is art complete and set to begin the pre-proof process with the printer on March 1st to make sure all of the printed components look good. Short of a production issue with some of the bespoke components, delays in shipping or issues with proofing that require reworks, we intend to release the game on time. We will always choose quality production over timeliness, so delay of the game is possible, but we will be ready to hit the printer with final components right at the end of the campaign.\n\nThere is the chance of delay in shipping or customs that is largely out of the control of our company, but we are experienced in moving products through customs. Of course, with multiple freight solutions going to various parts of the world it's possible some regions will get the game more quickly than others. Our goal is to ship the game as soon as it lands on any continent, so we'll have to ask for your patience if some regions get the game before others.\n\nWe intend to sell a limited amount of Dino Island at GenCon 2017 in limited non-deluxe edition (retail) copies, and there is the chance that some of those copies will be sold prior to all backers getting copies of the game, especially international backers where mailing delays can take a long time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "Standard Dinosaur Island", "descp": "One copy of the retail edition of Dinosaur Island + All Standard Edition Stretch Goals unlocked.

Suspicion and tension abounds. \n\"Just nine cards?\" you say? Yes. The most terrifying nine plastic character cards ever. If you're familiar with Two Rooms and a Boom, you're aware that just one character can change the entire game. Multiply that by nine, and your mortal mind will begin to comprehend the dire corruption these characters will inflict upon your feeble friends.\nThe player standing next to you, that player you think you can trust, could actually be an Elder God (like, say, Yog-Sothoth) with the power to end the game instantly.

But this expansion pack is DONE as is. We're talking about a foil pack with 9 beautiful plastic cards. Yeah, plastic... just like in the original game.

So the biggest challenge for us will always be proving that we've learned our lessons by ensuring that our backers get their high quality games on schedule.\n\nThere is a chance that not all players will enjoy Two Rooms and a Boom, or especially this expansion of Necroboomicon. People are like snowflakes, each totally different. This is one of the reasons that we put so many dang character cards in the base game. Character cards greatly change the way the game is played, making Two Rooms more of a game system than a game itself. So while there is no character that every snowflake will love, there is a character for every snowflake to love. Necroboomicon is for those hardcore snowflakes that don't mind losing in an instant.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Necroboomicon Foil Pack", "descp": "Get the first expansion (includes 9 plastic character cards, mini-rule book, and foil pack).", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2,045 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Necroboomicon AND Two Rooms and a Boom", "descp": "Get the first expansion (includes 9 plastic character cards, mini-rule book, and foil pack) + a copy of the base game, Two Rooms and a Boom!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,626 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Make/100 Signed Copies!", "descp": "Get the first expansion (includes 9 plastic character cards, mini-rule book, and foil pack) + a copy of the base game, Two Rooms and a Boom, SIGNED BY THE CREATORS with a \"personal message.\"", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["89 backers", "Limited (11 left of 100)"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #16", "update_userinfo": "More Two Rooms coming soon -- and a new Mothership module on kickstarter!", "update_content": "More Two Rooms and a Boom?\nIf you've been at convention or two this year you might have seen Alan breaking out something pretty new for Two Rooms and a Boom.

One always starts with those closer to his city. \nThe player gets 2 monsters out of the forest, from the top of his monster pile and moves them on the path. If the boss is on top of the pile, he goes alone and moves along the path. \n(1) The goblin, already present on the path, moves one square. (2) Another goblin arrives and moves one square too. (3) An orc enters the path and moves two squares.\n Every Tower on the path can shoot a monster of the same colour, present in any of the 4 squares surrounding it. Every tower can shoot the boss. \nWhen a monster is hit for the first time, he loses a life point and is turned on its \u201cinjured\u201d side. A monster on its \u201cinjured\u201d side is captured if it loses another life point. The player places it on his City dashboard and wins 2 crystals.\nThe first blue tower shoots the blue monster so it is flipped on its wounded side. The red tower shoots the orc which is also flipped. The second blue tower can\u2019t shoot the spider because it is a yellow monster.\nIf at least one Boss has been killed, the game will end when the Night phase is over. Player with the most Victory Points wins the game.\nYou get Victory Points by saving as much guards as possible, by wounding, or killing the Boss, and by completing challenges.\n   An event card is revealed. The effect of the new card will be applied during the next round.\nEnglish texts are temporary and will be translated by a professional after the Kickstarter campaign.\n  Starting with the first player and turning clockwise, every player will play one of the 4 following actions.\nExcept in the situation where the player chooses the \u201cDraw 2 Cards\u201d action, he can play on card from his hand after having played his initial action.   \n The gameplay video is made by us with a prototype. Pictures are work in progress but the element sizes are near the final ones.\n  With all your crystals gathered in your city, you ended up catching the interest of your neighbors, especially these Green Skins living in the mountains. \nHeaded by a brutal leader, they are coming down the mountain in hordes to raid your city\u2026  \n  Fortunately for you, your city is greatly walled, and a large number of guards are watching over its doors\u2026 but how long can they hold if the monsters are camping at the feet of your walls, and attack them every night?   \n \nLuckily your workers have mastered the art of building towers. Once in place, they should slow your enemies down, if not destroy them!   \n  Click on the picture for more information about this addon\n    Click on the picture for more information about this addon\n                          Click on the picture for more information about this addon\n     Click on the picture for more information about this addon\n  Click on the picture for more information about this addon\n  WARNING!

This fully cooperative game for 2 - 6 players challenges your team to overcome the Minions of Wrath, massive monsters and heinous hordes intent on destroying the civilized world.\nWorking together, you must tactically disable your opponent, piece-by-piece, with each player doing their part to achieve victory. If all players are disabled, or if the Minion gains control of the battlefield, everyone loses and the innocent people of your world are sure to follow!\n   Minions of Wrath\n Player Classes\n Player Weapons\nCustomization\nReplayability\nFree Promotional Item\nAs a special thank you to the amazing Kickstarter supporters who are making this game possible, all of our physical game level backers will also receive a special Limited Edition Metal Wrath Token for use with their game.\nThis promotional item is not a Kickstarter exclusive, and will be for sale after the campaign is over as supplies last, but all physical game level backers will receive one free of charge along side their copies of Wrathborne Champions! Please see update #11 for more information!\nAt the start of each game, players create a unique deck comprised of one class' abilities, one weapon's attacks, and a selection of customizing items. In addition to controlling all of the actions that a player can take, these decks are their life total, with damage being applied directly to the deck itself.\nUsing a unique rebuilding mechanic, players must continuously use heals to strategically remake their dwindling decks, perpetually choosing the composition they believe will provide the greatest chance of future success.\nEach of the enemies in Wrathborne Champions, called Minions of Wrath, is a unique puzzle divided up into nine different sectors. To win, players must strategically dismantle their enemy sector-by-sector until the Minion is unable to fight back.\nBut watch out! The Wrath Token moving around the board identifies who has the Minion's ire.  Players who have, or are near, the Wrath Token are targeted by the Minion's unique attacks and set actions.\nThe Wrath Token moves each turn, but it can also be controlled by the Minions of Wrath, random effects, and even the players themselves, so strategy is key. Players must delicately balance the Wrath Token position, in addition to their attacks and defense, because it not only dictates how they are attacked, but also in what order they act!\nEach Minion of Wrath offers distinct challenges requiring different plans of attack, requiring players to work together to determine how best to conquer their foe.\nThere are nine Minions of Wrath, each with six levels and two distinct versions, providing over a hundred different Minion permutations for players to battle. Add in over 700 unique player/weapon group compositions for a group of six players and you have a game with hundreds of hours of enjoyment.\n    We have unlocked a full graphic redesign of the entire game by Jovial Graphics and Games! With this stretch goal unlocked, all copies of Wrathborne Champions will be upgraded, along with the Production Print and Play! See update 12 for more information!\nWe have unlocked a custom plastic insert for all copies of Wrathborne Champions. This will allow us to improve the box dramatically, creating a safe, professional storage solution for all game pieces which will help make sure they are protected for years to come.\nBetter yet, this insert is designed to safely and securely hold cards both in and out of sleeves. It also has space for the first series of expansion game upgrades that we are already testing! This means we can save money on the packaging for our expansions by making them temporary and ready to be included in the base game, allowing us to sell our expansions for less!\nWe unlocked an additional Minion of Wrath for the base game of Wrathborne Champions! This new enemy will be decided on by the backers once the campaign is over!\nDo you like a little more narrative with your combat? If so, this is the unlock for you!\nBuilt from my childhood love of Choose Your Own Adventure stories, these narratives will let you pick who you battle or how you battle them. They will be designed to let you pick who you save and what you have to do to save them.

This is a significantly bigger project but the lessons we learned over the last two years have had profound influence on our approach to Wrathborne Champions.\n\nIn light of this, the primary risk we would like to emphasize is the possibility of delays to our manufacturing and shipping schedules. We have taken careful steps to minimize this risk, including overestimating all of our timings and solidifying professional relationships far in advance of this campaign, but there is always the possibility of the unexpected, especially with the size and scope of the game. \n\nThe one promise we make regarding all of this is that we will be in constant contact with our backers and easy to reach should any questions arise. Each and every backer will be taking this journey with us, and the last thing we would do is leave anyone in the dark.\n\nThank you very much for taking the time to read through our entire page; we truly hope you will consider joining us.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Supporter", "descp": "You get access to all of our updates and our most profound thanks in helping us work towards our goal.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2017"}], "stat": ["50 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Scholar", "descp": "You will receive access to two high quality print and play editions:\n- A pre-production set as soon as the campaign is completed.\n- A production quality set when we order from manufacturing!\nINCLUDES:\nPrint and Play", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}], "stat": ["21 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Wrathborne", "descp": "You receive a copy of Wrathborne Champions in addition to the two Print and Play file sets.\nINCLUDES:\nWrathborne Champions Game\nPrint and Play", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["512 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Wrathborne - CANADA", "descp": "You receive a copy of Wrathborne Champions in addition to the two Print and Play file sets.\n**Canadian Backers Only**\nINCLUDES:\nWrathborne Champions Game\nPrint and Play", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only Canada"}], "stat": ["28 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 70 or more", "title": "Artisan Champion", "descp": "You receive a copy of Wrathborne Champions, the Print and Plays, and your choice of one of the following:\n- A cloth front, rubber backed mouse pad featuring the Hydra.\n- A high quality 8.5\"x11\" 18 month calendar featuring art from the game.\n- One of nine high quality full color 11\" x 17\" art prints featuring a Minion of Wrath of your choice.\n**add $15 for each additional item to get more than one.**\nINCLUDES:\nWrathborne Champions Game\nPrint and Play\nA bonus item of your choice.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["21 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 70 or more", "title": "Artisan Champion - CANADA", "descp": "You receive a copy of Wrathborne Champions, the Print and Plays, and your choice of one of the following:\n- A cloth front, rubber backed mouse pad featuring the Hydra.\n- A high quality 8.5\"x11\" 18 month calendar featuring art from the game.\n- One of nine high quality full color 11\" x 17\" art prints featuring a Minion of Wrath of your choice.\n**add $15 for each additional item to get more than one.**\n**Canadian Backers Only**\nINCLUDES:\nWrathborne Champions Game\nPrint and Play\nA bonus item of your choice.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only Canada"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Randover Game Pack", "descp": "You get a copy of Wrathborne Champions, our first game Cast & Capture, a Cast & Capture oversized play mat, and a copy of our unreleased card game Nim's Bounty!\n**Add $15 each if you would like the mouse pad, calendar, or any Minion of Wrath art prints.**\nINCLUDES:\nWrathborne Champions Game\nPrint and Play\nCast & Capture\nCast & Capture Game Mat\nNim's Bounty Card Game", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["31 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Randover Game Pack - CANADA", "descp": "You get a copy of Wrathborne Champions, our first game Cast & Capture, a Cast & Capture oversized play mat, and a copy of our unreleased card game Nim's Bounty!\n**Add $15 each if you would like the mouse pad, calendar, or any Minion of Wrath art prints.**\n**Canadian Backers Only**\nINCLUDES:\nWrathborne Champions Game\nPrint and Play\nCast & Capture\nCast & Capture Game Mat\nNim's Bounty Card Game", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only Canada"}], "stat": ["3 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 150 or more", "title": "Traveling Merchant", "descp": "This is a Retailer specific reward to get Wrathborne Champions for sale in your store!

Scroll down to see all the new details.\nBrave Delvers from across the realm have journeyed to seek their fortune within the dungeons of Skull Cavern. Gold, treasures, and perilous encounters await behind every door! Grab your gear, sharpen your swords and watch out for those kobolds! \nIn Delve, players guide their band of adventurers through the dungeons of Skull Cavern. Each turn, place a dungeon tile and a delver, explore the dangers below and search for loot. When a room or corridor is completed, delvers must fight for their share of the gold and treasure. If a player manages to complete a room alone, they instead must overcome dangerous encounters before collecting their riches. Designed by legendary talents Richard Launius and Pete Shirey, Delve combines tile laying and an immersive narrative experience in a new and exciting way\n  Delve is a tile laying game for 2-4 players that plays in under 60 minutes designed by the legendary team of Richard Launius and Pete Shirey. For more information, we encourage you to view the video content below, or simply read our draft rulebook here.\nThe Peril Awaits expansion of Delve contains 10 more treasure cards and 30 more encounters, adding even more dungeon-exploring adventures for you and your fellow delvers! Promos will not be part of the retail version of Delve.\nWe have also implemented updated tile art, which can be seen below!\n                 We have a number of exciting goals to reach during this project - more dice, more encounters, more promos! Help us spread the word and make this project even better for everyone.\nPromos are extra content that won't be in the retail edition of the game, promos are an extra reward for backers of this project.\n  In addition to the more traditional funding goals above, we encourage our backers to unlock more content by becoming a fan and/or follower on our various social platforms:\n           Delve is the 33rd project from the combined teams behind Indie Boards and Cards & Action Phase Games. With the successful execution of our first 32 projects, we have become experienced publishers with a reputation for great games (in design and production) that are delivered in a timely fashion.\nDelve was designed by talented newcomer Pete Shirey and tabletop legend Richard Launius (Arkham Horror, Elder Sign, Defenders of the Realm). This game has undergone extensive testing and development to ensure the best possible experience. We are confident that this game will be in your collection for years to come.\nBackers will have early access to promo content in Delve, which will not be available in retail upon initial release. It may be released in the future, but if you miss this Kickstarter, we cannot guarantee that it will be available at a later date.\nAll of the art assets are complete and ready for immediate upload after the project funds.\nPrices include US shipping. This project also is EU & Canadian friendly.\n  Kickstarter is the world's largest funding platform for creative projects. Every month, tens of thousands of people pledge millions of dollars to creative projects in dozens of categories.  \nA person who supports a project is called a \"backer.\" The process of giving money to this project is called a \"pledge.\"\nIn return for your pledge, we (the creators of the campaign) are able to offer \"rewards,\" depending on the amount you pledge. For example, if you pledge $38 to help back the project, we'll offer you a copy of the game along with any stretch goals we achieve as soon as it is manufactured.\nYou can become a backer in just three easy steps:\nStep 1: Read through the pledge levels and rewards we're offering in the right sidebar of this page.\nStep 2: Click the large, green \"BACK THIS PROJECT\" button to the right of the trailer video at the top of this page.\nStep 3: Enter your pledge amount, and complete the steps for filling in your information.

It may also be the case that we are unable to get games to Origins in time.

Shortly before each event, we will ask you what you would like to reserve for Thursday pickup (NOTE: we cannot handle prepaid reservations or hold items past Thursday).\nAll the specials & promo items will be available in the games we bring to Origins - your support is very valuable to Indie Boards and Cards & Action Phase Games and we look forward to seeing you again this year with lots of great new games.\nInternational Shipping\nWe are very excited to be continuing our international partnerships to offer Canadian & EU Friendly shipping options as well as shipping options for Australia.\n                ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the 33rd Kickstarter project from the combined teams behind Indie Boards and Cards & Action Phase Games.

Our previous experiences will enable us to also deliver this project on time and we have every confidence that Delve will on schedule and of the highest possible quality.\n\nThat said, there are always complexities and considerations in a project of this scope that may cause delays. Indie Boards and Cards will use contract manufacturing to make this game, freight forwarders to get games through customs and 3rd parties like Amazon, the US Post Office and FEDEX to ship the games to you - we don't control everything and there are lots of opportunities for delay.

However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and submit your project survey results (ie, provide us with your shipping address) for your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received.

Although it feels like a traditional notebook, the Everlast is endlessly reusable and connected to all of your favorite cloud services. \nWhen you write using any pen from the Pilot Frixion line, your writing sticks to Everlast pages like regular paper. But add a drop of water\u2026 and the notebook erases like magic.\nThe Everlast notebook is compatible with the Rocketbook app. That means before your notes go off the page they go online to destinations like Google Drive, Dropbox, and Evernote \u2014 perfectly organized.\nPrior to shipping, we will send you a survey, so you can select which size(s) you want. Feel free to mix and match if you purchase multiple Everlast notebooks.\nNote: There is a typo in the 5+ reward where we reference Waves (not Everlasts). It should read \"US and Canada backers add $30 for each additional Everlast. International add $36. (additional Everlast prices include the extra shipping)\"\n The Everlast is not a whiteboard book.\nYou can use any pen from the Pilot Frixion line. Frixion gel ballpoint pens come in all different kinds and colors and are available for purchase online and in stores.\nWe worked closely with paper industry experts to find the optimal synthetic polyester blend to create pages that could be wiped clean of Frixion ink, but also felt perfectly natural to write on. Writing on an Everlast page feels just like writing on regular paper with a smooth finish.\nThe pages do not have a weird high gloss. And, the writing doesn\u2019t just wipe away.\nHere is where things get crazy. When you combine Frixion pens with the Everlast pages a dry paper towel doesn\u2019t do a thing. But a moist paper towel removes every bit of ink. So you can reuse your notebook over and over again.\nMACHINE VISION \nThe Rocketbook System is the combination of a special notebook and a free mobile app. Write notes and create designs in your notebook with a pen. Then, using patent-pending image capture technology, the Rocketbook app accurately and quickly captures and sends your notes to pre-configured cloud services.\nSEVEN SYMBOLS \nThe seven symbols at the bottom of each page are the magic \u201cbuttons\u201d behind the Rocketbook\u2019s quick and easy cloud organization. You assign each icon to the destination of your choice, any folder inside Dropbox, Evernote, Google Drive, Box, Slack or your email address. When you mark that icon on your page, the Rocketbook app automatically files your notes in the right place.\nIMAGE PROCESSING \nIn an instant, the Rocketbook app crops and enhances each page so your digital notes are more crisp and vibrant than the real thing.\nINTELLIGENT PAGES \nEach page of your Rocketbook Everlast contains a special QR code which tells the Rocketbook app the page number of each scan. That means no matter how or when you scan your Everlast, we can always get your notes in the right order. Each page also has a narrow dark border surrounding it. The border allows the Rocketbook app to find your page quickly in any environment or background, like a messy desk.\nDOT GRID+ \nThe pages all feature a unique dot grid pattern that is perfect for both text notes, sketches and diagrams. NO NOTEBOOK? NO PROBLEM. \nForgot your book or just want to take a test drive? We offer free PDF downloads of Rocketbook pages with our special border. Give it a try today! \n8.5 x 11 Page | A4 Page \nSMUDGE FREE ZONE\nFrixion pen ink completely dries and bonds to the page in about 15 seconds. After that, you\u2019re writing doesn\u2019t budge without moisture. You can flip the page before that, but there may be some slight transfer of the ink. Frixion markers are great for adding a dash of color but they can transfer a small amount of ink to the opposite page. \nPLAY\n\nMAXIMIZE EVERLASTICITY \nONLY USE PILOT FRIXION PENS. Although there are other inks that work, the entire Frixion pen line is the most accessible and they erase perfectly. Plus, they are just excellent pens. If you leave the ink on a page for a really long time (like months), it may leave a faint ghost behind, so it's a good idea to erase every few weeks to keep your book in perfect condition.\nCUSTOMS & DUTIES INFORMATION - FOR INTERNATIONAL ORDERS\nWe cannot mark as gift, this is illegal so we will not be able to do this.\nOur prices do not include VAT, GST or other country taxes.\nAs many of you know, our terms of sale are CIF destination.

The first player to complete the puzzle by positioning their heroes accordingly collect the quest card and its benefits. \n  Each round is broken down into two phases, the day phase and the night phase.\n  In the night phase, players will roll adventure dice in a communal press-your-luck fashion to try to accomplish the tasks at the locations they ended at during the day phase. This could be fighting a goblin, learning a spell, or delving into a temple. But be careful, if you take too much damage you may exhaust and lose all that round's progress and more! \nPlayers keep track of their heroes' collective health, power and progress on personal adventure logs.\nAnd when you acquire powerful items, you equip them right to your ITEMeeples\u2122! \nPlayers keep track of their spell progress, and the rounds magic level on a community magic mat. As the round's magic increases, goblins become more threatening and even your own power turns from good to bad!\nAfter five rounds, the game is over. While you may not have single handedly saved the world, did you accomplish more than the other players? Whoever has the most points in the end from goblins killed, spells learned, quests accomplished, and legendary items acquired, wins the game!\n    Help us stretch on Social Media: \nClick to visit us on Facebook!\n    Click to find us on Twitter!\n  More stretch goals:\n                          Community Suggested Stretch Goal!\n  This is a DELUXE ONLY Stretch Goal.\n      Glorious Victories are digital content for the Premium Print 'N Play.

We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 75% complete. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are working with our long time partners Panda Game Manufacturing. Who we've worked with on over 10 separate projects and have a great relationship with. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements and costs for when it comes time for shipping. We will provide tracking information for the boat when the games leave China.\n\n3. We are working with Ship Naked again for project fulfillment. Having worked with them for over 4 years, we are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way. They have fulfilled all our projects and have proven to be communicative, punctual and respectful when dealing with our customers.\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication. I will be transparent with our process and involve our backers as much as possible. I will be present daily during the project to answer any questions and I read every comment.

Add-on $20 to your reward to get an extra set of roller derby minis.\nEach set of 2 roller derby teams also come with a Referee figure in the pose for showing Lead Jammer.\nIMPACT ROLLER DERBY BOARD GAME\nImpact City Roller Derby is a board game that captures all the action of the fastest growing sport in America \u2013 women\u2019s flat track roller derby. Each player takes control of a team of five Rollergirls including a Jammer, Pivot and three Blockers. Your Jammer zooms around the track and scores points by weaving through the pack and passing your opponents Blockers. The Blockers play both offense and defense as they open up holes for your Jammer to whip them through and also attempt to slow down or send the opposing Jammer flying off her skates. Skate Fast\u2026.Hit Hard!\nIn Impact City Roller Derby, you get to simulate the speed, strategy and blocking that makes the sport so exciting. Each game is a series of short races, called jams, where your Jammer tries to score as many points as possible by lapping opposing player. Each player takes alternating turns moving their Rollergirls and making strategic decisions to help their cause or hinder the opponent.  \nThe game can be played with Scrimmage rules in just 1 hour and the Full Bout rules can be played in under 2 hours.  \nHere is a great detailed playthrough of the board game: https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/766820/playtesting-session-review-play-play     Thomas Grimstad who did the detailed playthrough also did a 19 minute video walk-through.  Thomas is a fan of the game and helped us develop the rules during playtesting so its not a professional video (fair warning):  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-kE__pEA2U\nImpact City Roller Derby currently has a 5 star rating on Amazon.com (however the copies sold there do not have any resin miniatures).\nWe did a photography session with the Naptown Roller Girls (the national team from Indianapolis) to get real roller girls doing the moves that are on the cards you can play during the game.\n And here is the board for the game\n The main game is delivered with wooden Roller Derby meeples\n OTHER SPORTS GAMES AVAILABLE\nSALACIOUS T - BLOCKER MINIATURE in METAL - $3\nSalacious T was a blocker for the Naptown Roller Girls (and was made into a miniature with her permission). The resin teams could use a blocker with a more full figured profile to really lay a beat down on opposing players and Salacious T will add that to your miniatures.\nFORCEBALL\nForceball is our highly rated 2 player card game based on a game of futuristic hockey/lacrosse.   The game is very fast paced with deep strategy and the rules can be scaled for an easy game to play with your children or a more strategic complex game to play with your adult friends.\nThis review by Drake's Flames gives you a good idea of how the game plays and the strategies involved:  http://drakesflames.blogspot.com/2012/01/card-game-review-forceball.html\nIf you want to add-on Forceball to any reward add $4 to your total pledge.\nPASSING SHOT\nPassing Shot is a dice game for two, that simulates a Tennis game in which each player takes a role of a Tennis Player. By means of consecutive dice rolls, the main aim of this game is trying to win points, games, sets and finally, the match. Each die has six facings, which are Ball (3 different colors), Out, Net and Energy. Through the use of the advance rules, players can do things like Approach the Net, Score an Ace, Second Serve, Play on different surfaces, Hawk-Eye, etc.\nIf you want to add-on Passing Shot to any reward add $10 to your total pledge.\nDICE FARMER\nThe Dice Farmer game is a great game to quickly play with children to work on additional skills. You start with 3 6 sided dice and roll them. By adding the dice together you add more dice to your pool of dice that you roll each round. First player to reach 3 D20s wins. The colors might change from the picture but each different die type will have its own color to help it be recognized. Tom Vasel @ The Dice Tower did a review of the game here if you would like more information ( http://www.dicetower.com/game-video/dice-farmer-review-tom-vasel )\nIf you want to add-on Dice Farmer to any reward add $26 to your total pledge.\nGOLF DICE\nGolf Dice is a great travel game fitting easily in a pocket. Use the dice to play 9 or 18 holes either solo or with as many players as want to tee up. The dice determine how many strokes it took you to hole out with a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 9 with par at 72 for 18 holes. Your caddy is there to try to help save you from any major errors but you must use his advice wisely to get the best score and have the low score when you finish the course.\nGolf Dice is only available as part of the CHRISTMAS SUPER BUNDLE reward.\nPAINTED MINIS\nAs part of the KickStarter we are offering the Impact City Roller Derby board game along with a full set of 10 metal roller derby minis painted.   They are our Pros teams.  One is a set painted in Red/Blue and the other is in Orange/Purple.\nRED/BLUE TEAMS\nORANGE/PURPLE TEAMS\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBefore we launched this KickStarter we have made sure the resin caster can have all the minis to us quickly in plenty of time to ship.

Created by Micha\u0142 Oracz (man behind 13 years of Neuroshima Hex and recent hit Cry Havoc) it brings next level of competitive gameplay to the table. Fresh, exciting, pure and rewarding.\nGame features six asymmetric factions with customization options, each with different set of units as well as cinematic spells and skills. It is played on two boards: conflict board where you resolve battles and campaign map where you can follow rich scenarios, learn the story and impact your world.\nThis game is created for 1-4 players.   \n                                                                                    With 1 faction box you can play against a Darkness faction controlled by the game. (although for full experience you will need another faction box to play a player vs player mode).  \nWith 2 faction boxes (or conflict box), you can play with 2 players (1vs1) and co-op versus a Darkness faction controlled by the game.  \nWith 4 faction boxes (or 2 conflict box), you can play with 4 players (2vs2 or free-for-all) and co-op versus Darkness faction controlled by the game.\nThe Edge: Dawnfall will offer 6 faction, each with different story, gameplay and amazing, high quality plastic models. \nBiggest modes are 9 cm high! \n                                               \n  The Edge is not just a game, but also a complex, rich universe. There is no good and evil here, just survival and conflicting interest of each faction.\n With the help of amazing writers, we have created set of stories that brings life into this game and factions. You can see first story book \"Battle of Eld-Hain\" by clicking below! \n   SEE FULL GAMEPLAY VIDEO! \nWe are dedicated to make our games as easy to learn as possible. Instead of complicated instruction, we want you to open the box, set up all the components and start playing right away, learning mechanism on the go.\nThe Edge: Dawnfall will provide special starting scenarios, so that players will be able to open the game and immediately start playing!\nWhile designing skill cards we did not want to go the easy way and put \u201c+x bonus\u201d on them. Instead we designed them to be highly dynamic and story related. Hound pulling sniper on his line of movement? Angel of Death with a final charge from the sky? Brute taunting his enemies? All possible in The Edge!\nThe Edge will have also rich campaign story mode, where the game will be played on 2 boards: economic /political map of the world and regular, conflict Board Game for resolving battles. This way, game will play on two levels, just like in Total War computer games series.\nScenarios will enable you to dive into rich The Edge universe, where you will learn about each factions motivation.They will also force you to take hard decisions with consequences later on in the game. \nEach faction from The Edge have different set of units, skill cards and other feel of play. This makes every match up really exciting and you can find a game style that will fit you best.\nWith large hex system we believe we brought revolution to overall movement and game dynamic. All actions are operated on small hex, but all movement and ranges are considered with Large Hexes (7 small hexes). This way, it is very easy to move around and flow of the game on big board is amazing!\nThe Edge comes with really BIG miniatures and we want you to feel their power and presence. Big units can push over smaller units out of their positions and this gives the game additional dimension.\nGameplay is focused on gathering crystals that will be added to your mana pool. They are constant source of power for your skills. Players are growing in power turn by turn and game is more tense with time.\nYou will be able to build your army and deck of skills. Thousands of possibilities limited only by your imagination!\n\n Micha\u0142 Oracz, creator of the game have vast experience in production and delivery of highest quality games - he spent 15 years in Portal Games and was actively involved in production of titles like Neuroshima Hex (over 100k copies sold). We know how to keep quality at best level.\n All components not including miniatures will be produced in Europe (Poland), so we will have direct control over quality.\nEstimated shipping prices (worldwide) for economical tracked postage (usually takes about 4 weeks to ship worldwide). Game weight will be about 3 kg.\nPlease note, that shipping will be paid after the Kickstarter campaign ends, from the Pledge Manager level. Prices are not final and might slightly change in the Pledge Manager, depending on how many stretch goals we will unlock.\nAlso, if you come from a country with limited postal access, there might be an additional fee required. VAT tax for European Union is included in the price of and because of no VAT tax regulations for countries outside of EU we are able to offer cheaper shipping prices for the rest of the wolrd.\n World's largest hobby miniature painting studio and creators of unique miniatures and various tabletop games. We have a vast experience in creating beautiful models for tabletop games and board games as well as high quality components. We have also created models for recent hit Cry Havoc. This game is being created by a team of people passionate about both the tabletop experience and rich storytelling.  \nTo create The Edge Dawnfall we have teamed up with Micha\u0142 Oracz.

It\u2019s an add-on pack that includes another complete deck of cards themed around a zombie outbreak instead of an asteroid impact. Every refugee and trait card will feature alternate art, and all text will be modified to fit the theme. All stretch goal cards will also be included, even the tarot-sized refugee cards!\nYou may have what it takes to survive an asteroid impact... but what about the zombie apocalypse?\n\nWant to add it on, but don't know how? Read the instructions here!\nThe End is Nigh is more classic deduction than social deduction, and is a fresh approach to the genre. The focus is on the non-playable refugees more than the individual players, so you don't need a masterful poker face, and there's no player elimination. Whether you're a civilian or a fanatic, you're trying to find out which of the refugees are cultists, and then either let them in or keep them out of the bunker.\nThat being said, there will be accusations of players being fanatics. Tension will rise and players will become suspicious. Be careful, though. It isn't guaranteed that there will be a fanatic among the players, there could be one, two, or none at all.\nHere's what reviewers have to say about The End is Nigh.\nNote: Reviewers received prototype copies which do not use some of the final terminology, art, or design. The gameplay is all the same.\n\u201cI think this is a really interesting game / gameplay mechanic, and it works pretty well. (...) I actually enjoy The End Is Nigh a lot!\u201d - Eric, What's Eric Playing?\n\"I liked it a lot. It\u2019s very different from a lot of those games like The Resistance, although it has much of the same DNA.\" \"I think the traits are perfectly balanced, for both sides.\" - Jon and Will, Roll For Crit\n  \"This is something that I really, really enjoy.\" - Brian, Cloak and Meeple\n    Mystic Ape Games isn't a huge company (yet). We mail each one of our games by hand from St. Louis. Basically, we aren't at the stage where we're able to ship a pallet of games to a warehouse in another country to fulfill games. If you're outside the United States, you will likely have to pay VAT fees. If you have any questions about shipping please shoot us a message!\nConsidering picking up a copy of Private Die with your pledge, but want to know more? Check out our Board Game Geek page, or the Kickstarter page. We think you'll like what you'll see. Here's what people have to say about it:\n\"Super compelling for such a tidy concept!\" - BGG Reviewer\n\"Had a blast playing this with my partner the other night, this will definitely be hitting the table more!\" - Kickstarter Backer\n\"Playing Private Die from @MysticApeGames Awesome dice game!\" - Twitterer (Tweeter? Twitterite? Twittonian?)\nStill have questions? Just ask!\n  You can add-on one or more of the above to your pledge! Don't know how? We've written up some instructions here.\nMystic Ape Games is run by three guys from St. Louis. We strive to make awesome games and provide you with a great Kickstarter experience. Here's what a couple of our previous backers had to say about us:\n\"Thanks for making my first experience with KickStarter such a great one.\"\n\"Creators listening to their backers like you do is what makes Kickstarter a great place!\"\n\"I will say that because of your level of professionalism and willingness to communicate, I will gladly check out any of your future projects.\"\nWant to know more about the people running the show?

We've made the Genius Expansion FREE to all campaign backers!  You all are the best!\n Doesn't everyone love Einstein? We sure do. The crazy hair, the bike, the wild tongue - Einstein was an irresistible icon of the 20th century. So we decided to make a game inspired by Einstein's life that is accessible to us all! \nEinstein is a light co-op/competitive abstract strategy game for 2-4 players. Game time runs 15-30 minutes and takes you into the life and science of everybody's favorite genius - Albert Einstein.\nEveryone Plays Einstein. Seriously, who else would you want to play? Each player represents Einstein during one of four periods in his life: Young, Prime, Globetrotting, and Wise.\nSimple Mechanics. You place exactly two tiles on your turn minimizing downtime. These Idea Tiles are added to a common shape, the Big Idea, which is shared by everyone and evolves over the course of the game. Even non-gamers are playing in minutes.\nSubtle Strategy. Each Einstein has their own Inspirations - private shapes they are trying to complete in the Big Idea. There are also Major Theory shapes that anyone can complete. Points are awarded for collaboration so be careful about helping your opponents too much!\nUnique Tile Shapes Ensure Replay Value. Every player has four types of Idea Tiles symbolizing Einstein's knowledge of physics, mathematics, chemistry, and philosophy. Indulging our inner geek and paying homage to another famous physicist, Roger Penrose, we chose Penrose tiles for these which create amazing patterns and a different game every time.\nRich in History. Meticulously researched and full of fascinating detail, cards are loaded with history showcasing the human side and other lesser known aspects of Einstein's life.  Guess who never wore socks and loved playing the violin...\nBroken Token Premium Organizer. A sweet birch wood insert that you can also pledge as an add-on option to organize all of your components.  \nFREE Genius Expansion Stretch Goal.  The Genius Expansion evolves the world of Einstein and provides an exciting step-up for our more energetic players. Leveraging the components in the base game, along with some new ones, the expansion layers on the kinds of strategic choices and player interactivity that hobby gamers love. It will include a new deck of cards to bring these mechanics to life along with entirely new rules for taking your Einstein experience to the Genius level!  We're planning on charging for this at retail, but are providing it free to all campaign backers as a thank you for making this project a success!\nEinstein is designed for everyone: women and men, boys and girls, serious and casual gamers, and the geniuses and mere mortals among us. Enrich your own space-time and help us bring this project to life!\nWe've already received a couple of great early reviews and quotes about Einstein with more soon to come.  We'll post and link to these as we get them!\n                                    We've partnered again with our friends from the Broken Token to create a sweet premium wood organizer for the campaign. Carefully designed to fit inside the base game box, this \u215b\u201d Baltic Birch insert is custom-made for us with designated spaces to hold all of the goodies from Einstein! Plus, it comes in a neat package with detailed assembly instructions. Give your components the love they deserve!\nEinstein takes 2-4 players on a tabletop tour of Einstein's life as they attempt to complete Inspirations and Major Theories using tile-shaped Ideas.  Play is co-op/competitive, quick, and fun with tremendous replay value.  Complete rules are available (excuse the draft form!) and we've also highlighted some of the major aspects of play below. \nPick your Einstein and draw a hand of three personalized Inspiration cards from your Inspiration deck.\n  On your turn, play exactly two of your Idea Tiles into the Big Idea at the center of the table.\n  Score Prestige by using your Idea Tiles to complete (a) your personal Inspirations, or (b) Major Theories available to everyone. Prestige is shared with collaborators on Inspirations.\n  The Einstein with the most Prestige at the end of the game wins!\n        Einstein will be manufactured in China. Copies will then be sent to our fulfillment partner depots in various regions around the world for ultimate distribution to backers. This saves you on shipping and extra taxes.\nWe're offering deeply discounted shipping to our backers everywhere in the world.  We recognize that even with these discounts, shipping to many parts of the world is just plain expensive, but we're doing what we can to make it easier.\nGiven our strategy of shipping to regional fulfillment depots, various countries will receive their copies at different times. Historically, backers in Asia and the Pacific receive their copies soonest since they are nearest to our manufacturer, then the U.S. and western Europe are relatively close together, and finally backers in the rest of the world receive theirs. We anticipate that all backers will receive their copies by June 2017, but most of you will receive your copies sooner. We'll keep you posted with more details via regular updates as we move forward into production and fulfillment.\nArtana is committed to supporting our retail partners. We offer wholesale pricing to verified stores and other gaming establishments. We treat you like other backers, but you will receive your rewards ahead of other normal distributions channels. If you are a verifiable retailer, please contact us through Kickstarter or send an email to hello@artana.com for more information about how to pledge at this level.\n(Designer) Dirk Knemeyer is the creative director of Artana.

You'll protect your home by ironically using parts of your house as weapons and defenses. If all else fails, you can screw over your neighbors...because ultimately, a dead neighbor is better than a dead you.\nThe game takes a minute to learn, and gets even the newest of players immediately into the fun and chaos of surviving the brutal waves of sweet-toothed villains. \nOn your turn, you reveal an action card - it tells you how many monster cards to place on to your field.\nThe monster tells you where it goes on the board. \nYou play as many cards from your hand as you want to help your survival.\nThe monsters all move closer to your home. If it enters a space with a defense, they fight - the highest number survives.\nIf a monster gets to your house, you lose!  Last player or team alive wins.\n      \"Game looks and plays awesome.

This is a noble and honorable quest, and... oh, who are we kidding? In reality, you're a greedy wizard who is all about fame and personal gain, and your fellow wizards are cut from the same cloth! Prevail over your opponents by learning the best spells and using that knowledge to outmaneuver and kill-steal in the dungeon, so you can gain admiration of the townsfolk, fame across the realm, and achieve Pixel Glory. In the first phase, the town phase, players will be drafting spells using an auction mechanic. Players will then take their decks into the second phase, the dungeon phase, where they will work together to defeat monsters; however, only the player that deals the lethal blow will get the fame for it. There is a lot of interaction and engagement due to players fighting over learning the same spells as well as fighting over fame.\nTo learn more, check out the Board Game Geek Page!\n  Credits\nPublisher: Zafty Games\nDevelopment: We Make Games, Indie Game Alliance\nKickstarter Video: We Make Games\nKickstarter Audio: Song: The Walking Dead.

As the game unfolds you\u2019ll be forced to make difficult decisions to stay alive as the story takes unexpected twists and turns. \nWhat is Star Saga?\nStar Saga is the successor to 2014\u2019s Dungeon Saga, praised for its simple core mechanics that provided a perfect opening for new players. Star Saga will introduce refined and more streamlined rules, and feature both \u2018learn-as-you-go\u2019 gameplay for novice adventurers and more advanced mechanics for seasoned gamers.  \nWith completely new solo gameplay and deeper narrative elements, Star Saga delivers a true RPG dungeon crawler experience\u2026 in the depths of a subterranean base on a far-off alien world!  \nFurther campaigns and expansions will utilize the full scope of science fiction settings, from space stations and starships to alien landscapes and beyond.\n     GAMEPLAY \nStar Saga uses classic dungeon crawler mechanics: players move their characters through the environment, opening doors, picking up loot, and revealing more of the board as the game progresses. Combat is resolved with a simple system of opposed dice rolls, while player statistics, abilities and special rules are all laid out on wonderfully designed game cards, allowing most players to learn the game as they play. \n\u2022 1-5 Players: Control all the Mercenaries yourself, or team-up to complete your mission co-operatively and take down the mastermind behind the facility on Eiras!\n\u2022 Solo Play: Newly developed solo play rules allow the game itself to take the role of the villain with simple card-based AI. \n\u2022 Ready to Play: Star Saga will include all the pre-assembled miniatures you\u2019ll need to start playing right away. You\u2019ll get all the necessary game cards, tiles and components for the complete dungeon crawler experience in one box. \n\u2022 Advanced Rules: Newly refined advanced rules will provide everything that the veteran-gamer needs \u2013 campaigns, experience, character creation, mission creation, and more. \n\u2022 High Quality Figures & Packaging: The core pledge includes 54 highly detailed miniatures molded from premium plastic, with thick, high-quality double-sided tiles and counters. Packaged in a vacu-formed plastic tray to hold your figures firmly in place.

Chariot Race is his newest title, and from such a masterful game designer you are guaranteed a quality game-play experience!\n          For the sake of transparency we would like to talk about the nature of this campaign. Chariot Race is a co-produced game with our partners Pegasus Spiele, this means that Chariot Race is being manufactured right now, and is expected to arrive at our KY warehouse by late-November. Normally here at Eagle-Gryphon Games we launch Kickstarters in the hope of having a game concept, from mostly first time designers, become funded so we can turn that concept into a reality. This campaign however is outside of the norm, so, you may ask, why are we launching a Kickstarter campaign?\nThe reason is that Kickstarter is the best way to debut Chariot Race to USA and Canadian backers! Currently Pegasus Spiele is about to launch the German version of Chariot Race across Europe, while Eagle-Gryphon Games will be selling the English version exclusively to the USA and Canada. Through our cooperative efforts we are making Chariot Race available to the public worldwide at approximately the same time. Kickstarter is by far the fastest way to get Chariot Race into your hands!\nHere are the key advantages to backing the Chariot Race campaign:\nA Great Price: $24, and the shipping will be much cheaper than purchasing Chariot Race from Europe.\nSpeedy Delivery: We expect to have Chariot Race shipped to everyone in time for the holidays. The plan is to have everything you pledged for (Add-Ons Included) in your hands by December!\nWe appreciate your understanding and support for the Chariot Race campaign, and we are happy to serve you in providing quality games for the Kickstarter gaming community.\n-- Ian Dudley, Creative Director, Eagle-Gryphon Games\n Votes of Confidence about Chariot Race\n\"Using the 'Roll through the Ages' system in a highly interactive setting is brilliant. This is a fast, light, somewhat chaotic chariot game that is a lot of fun. It's what most chariot racing games want to be, but either get bogged down in fiddliness or don't have enough interesting decisions. Recommended!\" -- sos1, Fan on Boardgamegeek\n\"Very fun - my kids love the prototype even if I'm not around\" -- markcarlson, Fan on Boardgamegeek\n                                           Eagle-Gryphon Games is committed to producing games of the highest quality, having intuitive box layouts, and use the best components available. We feel it is important that people who buy our products will receive a game that is well made and will be in playable condition for many years.\nEagle-Gryphon Games goes beyond industry standards in regards to using quality materials; for example, we have adequately thick playing cards that will stand the test of time, while looking and feeling superb with a linen finish. Our game box inserts fit perfectly for all of the game components, and are intuitively organized so that you can focus on game-play! Our dice, plastic, and wood components are tailored with great care towards their specific roles during game-play, making your game night that much more enjoyable. Eagle-Gryphon Games is confident that you will be pleased with our products, and we want to thank you all for supporting our campaign. If you have any questions please direct them to customer-service@eagle-gryphon.com\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEagle-Gryphon Games stands by our products. If there are issues with your game, please contact our customer service department within 30 days of receiving your copy of the game that you have pledged for. We will take every step necessary to get you exactly what you purchased. Contact: customer-service@eagle-gryphon.com.\n\nShipping issues are relatively uncommon, but they do sometimes occur, especially when shipping to destinations outside of the US. We will send you tracking information when it is possible, but sometimes it is not. We cannot guarantee that there will not be local shipping problems, as we cannot guarantee the service and reliability of the various postal/delivery services involved around the world. You will have to assume that risk along with us.\n\nWe double check all of your games for damage before packing them up to send to you, however there is a small chance that your games may get damaged during shipping by the carrier. Please keep in mind that we did not cause that damage, nor are we responsible for it. If your package is damaged then your first recourse should be to recover your losses from the carrier, not us. If you are still struggling to find a solution through your carrier then we can try to assist you.\n\nWe will always do our best through Kickstarter updates to keep you as informed as possible to the status of your game(s). However, in this business there are a number of uncertain and ever changing factors that are beyond our control, such as: holidays, customs, quality control, inspection delays, inclement weather and dock strikes - to name a few. As you can imagine we have little to no control over such factors, but if anything is to occur we assure you that you will be the first to know.\n\nTo put it simply, you will get everything you are promised when you pledge to one of our Kickstarter Projects, and it will be delivered to you in as timely a manner as possible.\n\nShipping can be problematic and expensive. We ask that you are patient and tolerant and share the burden with us of making sure that shipping is as positive an experience as it can be. But be aware of what is involved please.\n\nWe ship your game(s) to you via various fulfillment partners located around the world. We do this in an effort to keep expenses as low possible, and hope that you will see this change reflected in the shipping costs for this project. \n\nShipping is far more comprehensive than many people realize. Not only does \u201cshipping\u201d include the postage cost, it also includes: getting the container shipped to the US, or the EU, or Australia; the Customs and VAT (or equivalent) and other import fees and taxes; the drayage from the port to the warehouse; the warehouse fees to unload and sort out and prepare packages; the materials and labor involved in the last item; fees to the warehouse for their service to us. Only after all of that, do we consider the postage! We need to cover all of those costs--and they really add up. Frequently they cost as much or more than the game(s) did to produce.\n\nWhen we combine a low margin price (such as the one we offer on all of our KS projects) with this shipping expense, we do not make any profit if we are not very careful. We hope that the shipping we are charging for this project is as low as we can make it and still stay in business.

The game takes a few minutes to learn, it's kid-friendly, and each round takes about 20 minutes to play.\n(Stretch Goals here!)\n    THE ORIGIN STORY\n                                   I\u2019ve always wanted to make a card game. A few years ago, I started working on a game based on my comic, The Oatmeal, where you connect heads, torsos, arms, and legs to create a variety of monsters based on characters from my comic, such as the Bear-O-Dactyl. The original version of this game was doodled onto paper cutouts, and had no functioning game mechanic other than \u201cbuild funny-looking things.\u201d \nThe very first version of the Oatmeal card game.\nTwo years ago I met Elan Lee, and he showed me a prototype of a game called \u201cBombSquad,\u201d which we renamed to Exploding Kittens. After Exploding Kittens launched, my creature-building game got put on hold.\nAfter the dust from Exploding Kittens eventually settled, I asked Elan to help with the design of my monster-building game. I didn\u2019t want this to be one of those games where you're trying to \"out-comedy\" one another; I wanted it to be more of a deck-building game, such as Dominion or Hearthstone, but without all the complexity. I wanted a monster-building game you could easily play at a party.\n Up until this point, my version of the game had a big problem:  when you played, you were on autopilot. You had no decisions to make and usually one correct action to perform on every turn.  Elan has been designing physical and digital games for most of his career (he invented the genre of alternate reality games, and was formerly the creative director of the Xbox), so he put his gargantuan puzzle-solving brain to work and added a layer of much-needed complexity to the game.  He tinkered a bunch and established the basic rules of conflict, construction, and the escalation mechanic that would define the core gameplay. The tricky part was keeping this simple enough to be a party game, but complicated enough to allow for depth and strategy. It\u2019s easy to fall into two bad categories when designing tabletop games: either they\u2019re easy to learn but completely random, or they\u2019re very strategic but mind-numbingly boring. You have to walk a very thin line between the two. I think with Bears vs Babies we did that.\nOur battle-hardened \"Sharpie Deck\"\nAfter months of pestering everyone we knew to play the game with us and tweaking the rules bit by bit, we finally got it to the point where our friends pestered us to play, instead of vice versa. And that eventually brought us here, to Kickstarter, where we\u2019re now pestering the whole internet to play with us.\nAnd so here we are. \nLet the bear hugs and baby burping begin.\n-Matt and Elan\n----------\n   ----------\n                                                                                 Press Inquiries\nEmail: info@bearsvsbabies.com\n----------", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRemember that one time two years ago when we built Exploding Kittens and shipped everything we promised to you ON TIME?\n\nSeems like a pretty keen idea to try that again.

You recruited volunteers, set up demo tables, and built up your booth. Your games are selling like cardboard hotcakes. All is well until you turn around, and your shiny new cash box is gone...\nThis is Steal This Game, based on a true story.\nOn Saturday, 15 October 2016, around 4 pm, our cashier realized that in the 10 seconds it took to look in our warehouse for a game, our cash box was gone.\nFor a small indie board game publisher, this represents a significant loss. Besides the financial hit, this has also affected us on an emotional level.\nGames are fun. Gamers are fun. They are also some of the most welcoming, generous, and trusting people around. For this to happen during the greatest celebration of cardboard & wood in all of boardgamedom is a devastating blow.\nAccording to what venue security told us when we submitted the police report, this is likely the work of professionals. Fellow friendly publishers have indicated that they noticed similar attempts or approaches by individuals that did not seem to know much about the hobby. We hope and assume that this was not done by any gamer.\nTHE GAME\nThe card front (draft)\nThis asymmetric nanogame, playable by two players in five minutes or less, fits on a postcard (with two dice supplied by the players). One player takes on the role of a boardgame publisher at a big convention.\nThe other player is a thief, intent on robbing the publisher's booth \u2014 rolling dice, lying, guessing, and shuffling cards.\nThe card back (draft)\nThe exhibitor tries to keep the cash hidden in one of the four cash boxes. The thief secretly rolls a pair of dice and then tries to make increasingly risky moves in order to gain more information about the location of the cash.\nIf the exhibitor catches the thief while attempting this, the thief makes one last attempt to steal. If that fails, then the exhibitor wins.\nUPDATE\nNew design (work in progress):\nRULES\nFor more details on the components and rules of Steal This Game, download the rule book here (right click and Save as\u2026).

The postcards may be sent from Germany, Hungary or Finland. EU backers do not have to worry about customs or VAT.\nShipments to backers outside of the EU and the USA will have the base game cost declared as the value of the package (the shipping cost will not be included in the declaration). The postcards are not subject to taxes.\nThe postcard will be sent through regular mail. Tracking is not offered through this campaign. If tracking is important to you, please contact us via the KS messaging system before the campaign is over.\nPlease note that we can not take any responsibility for any lost or damaged copies to Brazil, Hungary, Russia, or South Africa.\nThere is a large number of incredibly talented and even more generous people that we would like to thank.\nFirst among them is David Turczi, who never even said \"of course\" when asked to design this game.

Infusion comes with 24 Reinforcement Recruits and 12 are chosen randomly before each game begins to use as a shared pool of cards among all players.\nEstablish the Missions\nThere are two Basic Missions that players can Run during their turns, along with 12 different Epic Missions that offer players far greater rewards. The 12 Epic Missions are shuffled and three are randomly chosen at the start of each game.\nEpic Missions bring epic rewards, both in Reward Points and extra game text for your Hero.\nEnlist Help\nAssemble your team by Enlisting the help of hackers, artificial intelligence, space pirates, mercenaries, and more! Each Recruit you add to your deck will help Enlist additional Recruits and provide resources to Run Missions.\nUtilize special game text found on your Recruits to enhance your turns. The better the turn, the more Recruits you can Enlist and the harder Missions you can Run.  \n  Your Hero begins each turn with a limited number of Recruits to Assign. Some Recruits will help you Assign more Recruits, which can be vital for your turn. The order that you Assign your Recruits also matters!\nAdding Recruits to your deck is vital for winning the game, so you must Enlist their help! Your Hero will only be able to Enlist a limited number of Recruits each turn, and to do so will require Loyalty from the Recruits you\u2019ve Assigned. Adding up your total Loyalty each turn, generated by Recruits you\u2019ve Assigned, will tell you how expensive of a Recruit you can Enlist.\nRunning Missions is how you earn Reward Points and the player with the most Reward Points when the game ends, wins! Each of your Recruits will bring Skill to your turns, and each Mission has Skill Required in order to Run it. Tougher Missions require a lot of Skill, but you\u2019ll be highly rewarded when you Run them!\nExploits:\nEach Hero will have Exploits at their disposal, which can alter the course of the game. You\u2019ll use some Exploits to benefit yourself, while other Exploits will disrupt your opponent\u2019s turns.\n          Includes: 492 cards; over 100 unique card art  \n12 Oversized Hero Cards (Alice, Giphetto, Robin, Oracles, S.N.O.W. White, Talia, Hook, Hatter, S.N.O.W. Queen, Hyde, Wolfe, and Rumplestilskin)  \n24 Reinforcement Recruits (12 of each)  \n12 Epic Missions 60 Basic Cards  \n120 Epic Recruits and Exploits  \nAdditional:  \n12-page Rulebook\n\nLink to Rulebook\n\n Undead Viking Preview\n  Cardboard Stacker Preview\n       The story of Infusion takes place in a giant universe, full of awesome sci-fi adventures among hundreds of literary characters and creatures. Our first release is just the beginning; we designed Infusion to be expandable and have several expansions already in development.\nOur stretch goals include two new Reinforcement Recruits and three Epic Missions.  These cards have been tested with all cards included with Infusion.  Each add more diversity and depth to the already vast amounts of play Infusion offers.  \nLong For Something New:\nCompleting Missions can be hard work, and with Long For Something New players will find a new path to victory!  With this unlocked, the total Epic Mission count in each box of Infusion climbs to 13.  One copy of this Mission will be added to each box of Infusion!\nMach Turtle:\nOur Mach Turtle, built for economy and not for speed, will help any player turn their Exploits into a better hand on their following turn!  With this unlocked, the total Reinforcement Recruit in each box of Infusion goes to 25!  There will be 12 copies of this Recruit added to each box of Infusion.\nThe Shepherd:\nRunning a Mission requires Recruits and The Shepherd's goal is to assist you along the way.  With this unlocked, the total Epic Mission count in each box of Infusion climbs to 14. One copy of this Mission will be added to each box of Infusion!\nHare:\nYou can't have a Mach Turtle race without a Hare.  The Hare helps players race towards the finish line by advancing Epic Recruits into providing additional Loyalty.  With this unlocked, the total Reinforcement Recruit in each box of Infusion goes to 26! There will be 12 copies of this Recruit added to each box of Infusion.\nThat Little Urchin:\nSpace exploration can lead to fascinating discoveries.  Finding the mystical Urchin not only gives players Reward Points, but also a free Recruit to use on their following turn.  With this unlocked, the total Epic Mission count in each box of Infusion climbs to 15. One copy of this Mission will be added to each box of Infusion!\nOur final stretch goal unlocks thicker card stock for all Hero cards. This goal will see sturdier and more firm thickness along with higher quality of the Hero cards.\n  Infusion will ship securely within a standard, well packaged mailer.  We are utilizing two fulfillment companies, one in the US and one in the UK, to reduce the cost of shipping and to bring you Infusion as quickly as possible. We have included $12 for shipping within the pledge tiers. For the EU and the rest of the world, additional shipping costs will apply.\n                                                      Special - Network - Operator of - War\nThe S.N.O.W. Queen and her army of S.N.O.W. Troops have taken control of several sectors of the galaxy. A young girl, Alice, has uncovered a way to end the S.N.O.W. Queen\u2019s reign and defeat her S.N.O.W. legion. But she cannot do it alone. \nAlice has enlisted the help of S.N.O.W. White, an ex-S.N.O.W. Flake, to surmount the S.N.O.W. Queen and destroy her powerful artificial intelligence known as Mirror.\nRobin (a professional smuggler) and his friend Giphetto (a young, elite, computer hacker and coder infamous for his artificial intelligence programs) are hired by Alice to help. It doesn\u2019t take long for the group to run into trouble with S.N.O.W. Troops, a space pirate named Hook, and the S.N.O.W. Queen\u2019s personal shapeshifting bodyguard, Hyde.\nThroughout the world of Infusion exists different versions of familiar characters.  We have had fun creating this world and with it re-imagining several iconic tales.  We have changed the spelling of a handful of character names, along with creating a futuristic oppressive military force that goes by S.N.O.W.  This is a story we have loved bringing to life and we are incredibly excited to share it with you.  \n  With our first campaign, our goal was simply too high. We had contacted a manufacturer here in the US and had received a solid quote but with an extraordinarily high minimum order of 2500 units. For this campaign, we have found a manufacturer outside the US that produces nearly identical quality for 50% less and with only a 1000 minimum unit order. This has significantly reduced our funding goal without sacrificing the quality of our product.  \nAdditionally, we redesigned the card layout of the Recruit and Exploit cards. We feel this new layout gives the card a more focused and sleek look. The font change also fits our theme of sci-fi better than the previous font.\nWe have also become members of the Indie Game Alliance, which has been a huge benefit in a plethora of ways.  We have made new friends, new contacts, and opened several doors we could not have done on our own.  They were crucial in finding a more affordable manufacturer which allowed us to relaunch with a much lower funding goal.\n     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main risk we currently face is manufacturing and global shipping. \n\nThe game design was finished months ago and our main focus point for the last two months have been on finding a quality manufacturer and the best fulfillment options for global shipping. We have already received our quote from the manufacturer along with a sample box, sample cards, and sample oversized Hero cards. We feel confident in the quality of our manufacturer and in their work history to produce the final product in a quick manner with high production value. \n\nFor shipping, we are currently utilizing two fulfillment centers, one in the US and one in the UK. Our fulfillment center in the UK will be handling all shipping options outside of the US and have already given us firm shipping rates including VAT options. We are confident in our ability to deliver Infusion anywhere in the world.\n\nAll of our artwork is complete, including the additional cards found within our stretch goals. We are set for production, but we are on Kickstarter seeking the funds needed to put Infusion into the hands of our manufacturer.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Jenifer Wehner\n2 created \u00b7 1 backed\nCo-founder of 808 Games, LLC, an independent board game and card game development and production company.See more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Follower Tier", "descp": "Includes no rewards, but we will be eternally grateful for your support!

Its been a few years since we have heard from the crew (design/development and of the Pioneer!) and we feel its time to catch up! We hope to continue playing here too!\nAlien Uprising: Zothren Invasion is a stand-alone cardgame for 2-4 players by Tim Phillips and Sean Brown. It is set in the Alien Uprising Universe, originally designed by Richard Launius and Sean Brown.\nIn Zothren Invasion, players take turns drafting parts for their giant mech - a robot-like suit of armor they will pilot to defeat the hoards of invading Zothren \"bugs\". Each player will have access to a small hand of Items that can help them (or hurt others) in their quest for the most fame via bug kills!\nZothren Invasion takes place 7 years after the crash landing at Zothren Prime (AKA Alien Uprising). The crew of the Pioneer have all returned to their homeworld and have become celebrities due to their heroics abroad.\nThe crew must once again suit up for battle, but this time Earth is the target. One thing has changed though. The crew all want to prove that they were the true hero on Zothren Prime many years ago and are looking to seek the most fame by taking out as many bugs as possible. Don't look to your fellow crewmen for help this time. Its every crewman for themselves in this fast paced, quick card game.\nThe holocrons are rolling. The Zothren Invasion will be televised. Does your hero have what it takes to be the true defender of Earth?\n We have some really cool things that can add to the Zothren Invasion, but our main concern is to produce the game. If we are fortunate enough to have the support needed to make the game, we have a few ideas lined up to add to the experience if we do end up with extra funding!\nZothren Invasion Funding Goal Announced - Status: LOCKED!\nWith your support, Zothren Invasion will be a reality!\nFinal cover design is not yet determined and may change.\n We are so excited at the possibility of making this game a reality!\nZothren Invasion Stretch Goal Announced - Status: LOCKED!\nWith your support, we will add Pilots to the game!\nThis Pilot Pack will introduce a new element to the game.

Making games is hard...and making a game that doesn\u2019t fall short of your expectations or our claims is even harder.\n\nThat\u2019s why we waited a year to launch this Kickstarter. We thought about launching this campaign in 2015, but we thought it\u2019d be a better idea to go on a press tour for a year and show you all what we made in person!\n\nWe also wanted the opportunity to all work together as a team for a year so that we could have more clarity on what BSP would be. Once 2016 began, we quietly began working on our Kickstarter and developing our game beyond the prototype. In the time we\u2019ve spent building our vertical slice build of BSP, we\u2019ve become very confident in our ability to deliver on this goal.\n\nThankfully, we have lots of assistance! The AbleGamers Charity has years of research and experience in game accessibility design and on a case-by case basis they've designed countless controllers so that people with disabilities could experience the joy of videogames. They\u2019ll be helping us meet our accessibility goals for both our game and our controller.\n\nAnd we have our friends at IndieBox and Fangamer! Our friends at IndieBox are professionals at producing all kinds of merch for indie games and will be taking the controller production off of our plate. And thanks to Fangamer, we won\u2019t have to worry about reward fulfillment and can focus on the game instead.\n\nOverall, we believe that with our passion to make an accessible game that's just about just having fun, the support from our fans, and the help from our many friends, we'll be able to give you all the Butt Sniffin Pugs you've dreamed of. \u2764\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "\u2727 THE GAME \u2727", "descp": "Get a digital copy of Butt Sniffin Pugs upon release for Mac, PC, or PS4, your name in the game's credits, and some pugsquisite wallpapers for your phone or computer!\nINCLUDES:\nCopy of the Game\nName in Credits\nDigital Wallpapers", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2018"}], "stat": ["598 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "\u2726 EARLY BETA & STICKER SHEET \u2726", "descp": "Get a sweet sticker sheet of dogs, dogs, and MORE DOGS...and Early Beta access!

The pathogens must survive the body's powerful immune response, adapt in an ever changing environment, and evolve to take on virulence factors to increase their attack, defense, and other abilities so that they may do enough damage to defeat the body before the human host becomes immune and all the players lose the game.\nThe game is highly scalable, allowing players to choose their level of difficulty and the length of game they wish to play.\nPathogenesis blends the feel of center-row style deck builders such as Star Realms and Ascension with mechanics based 100% on real science, simulating the roles of pathogens and the immune system at each phase of the game.\nModes of play include solo, competitive, cooperative, team play, and classroom.\nWho might like this game?  Avid gamers, fans of deck builders, medicine & science enthusiasts, teachers and students from high school to college level and beyond.\n1-4 players.  Ages 14+   30-60 minutes\n                    RULE BOOK, click HERE to access:\nHATE RULE BOOKS? - CHECK OUT THESE HOW TO PLAY VIDEOS! \nBelow is a link to 7 short videos that will show you how to play the game from set up, how to play your turn, and the various aspects of game play followed by a complete solo game example. You can skip through the videos using the arrows on either side.\nPathogenesis is all about building pathogens to withstand the punishing immune response and defeat the body.  The pathogens put in play stay in play (until destroyed by the immune system) allowing you to continue to build them and attack the body each turn, unlike most deck building games where all cards are discarded at the end of your turn. \nYou begin the game with your own personal deck of 10 cards:\nThese cards allow you to gain and use genetic value to acquire stronger pathogens, trait cards, toxin cards, and environment cards. The upgraded cards acquired on previous turns will cycle back into your hand on future turns allowing you to play them on existing pathogens increasing their attack, defense, and other abilities.\nThe pathogens' first task is to attack the body and breach the body's defense barriers:\nOnce the body's defensive barriers are breached, the immune system activates and your pathogens must survive the body's powerful immune response each turn before you are able to damage the body and take victory points. \nThe initial immune response is dealt from deck 1.  When this deck runs out the discard pile is shuffled into immune deck 2 to form the final immune response.  If players do not meet the game end damage condition before the final immune deck runs out then the body declares immunity and all of the players lose the game.\nWant to play a demo of the game now?

Going through many jobs ranging from lab work to video game motion capture, he's brought his passions together making videos about board and video games, science, and more.\n\"A mechanistically solid and highly versatile deckbuilder in its own right, Pathogenesis has great potential as a wonderful educational tool - taking the incredibly complex science of immunology and making it more digestible and understandable for anyone wanting to learn. Highly recommend giving it a go!\" - Danny C.\nREVIEW VIDEO BY UNDEAD VIKING:\n \"I don't usually enjoy Deck Builders, but when I do, they are fantastic games like this one!\" - Undead Viking\nPREVIEW VIDEO BY BOARD GAME BRAWL:\n WHAT ARE PEOPLE SAYING ABOUT THE GAME?\n\"By taking the genre's strengths of customization and marketplace competition, giving it a wonderful theme, and removing the hassle of troublesome trash cards, Pathogenesis bridges the gap between new and experienced players, and even to those who typically don't reach for a deck-builder on game night like me.\" -Matt Ochs (Kansas City Game Designers)\n\"This is one game I've been looking forward to seeing become a reality. I had the pleasure of playtesting, and enjoyed it thoroughly. One of the big features I like are the options for co-op and team play.\" - Troy Pichelman (Kansas City Game Designers)\n\"I like that it is educational, but still FUN. As a college instructor, I see a lot of games that are educational. None of these games are fun to play outside of the classroom. I do not understand microbiology, but still have a great time playing Pathogenesis\". - Kelly C Hughes, Instructor at Alexandria Technical and Community College.\n\"Pathogenesis attacks a deck builder from an angle I have not seen playing as a bacterial pathogen attacking a body! The AI they have developed is very cleverly done and seems to think and guess what you as a pathogen are doing to it reacting and hitting back. This game is also VERY educational and great effort has been put not only into the artwork but the realism of the science as well. It strikes a great balance of learning but extremely fun at the same time!\". - Rodger Moore, Board Games & Beer Podcast & High School Biology Teacher.\n  We use the \u201cStegmaier\u201d method of shipping games in bulk to fulfillment centers around the world to reduce customs fees and VAT and to keep shipping prices low.

Jamie is full time professor of biology. When teaching the immune system, textbooks cover the subject in pieces and her students never get to see the whole picture. Her goal for this game was to help her students see how the immune system works as a whole.   \nLoren Cunningham is Jamie\u2019s husband and partner in crime. Together they created Transylvania: Curses & Traitors that was successful on Kickstarter in 2014.   Loren\u2019s background is in business rather than science, so his job was to make sure that the game and its mechanics worked well for EVERYONE regardless of their background in biology. He also makes sure that the games get manufactured and shipped to your door on time.\nScientific illustrator somersault18:24 is the artist and have partnered with WIBAI Games to bring art to the game that is scientifically accurate, yet re-imagined to achieve beautiful, eye-popping, images. somersault18:24 is run by the artists/scientists Luk Cox and Idoya Lahortiga. Both of them have a PhD in Biomedical Sciences and have set out on an ambitious journey to bridge the gap between the artistic visual arts and science. They excel in helping scientists and teachers to prepare easy-to-follow yet professional scientific illustrations.\nThomas Deeny is the graphic designer for Pathogenesis. He specializes in game design and book layout and has worked on several deck builders including Cthulhu Realms and Nightfall.

We did so much better than we had hoped for!! This was a really tough theme in the board game world to fly, but apparently many of you have still managed to see it for the superb game play it presents!\nIf you have missed this campaign, you can visit us at www.MedievaLords.com to follow us!\nFINAL STRETCH GOAL AT $7,500!\nTake it to the courts with your trusty racket as you battle it out in an intense tennis game. Sweet Spot is a tactical card game that sees players take on the role of a tennis pro battling it out in singles or doubles matches. Through all our reviews and feedback from public sessions, Sweet Spot has blown the minds of many, creating that exciting rush and sense of adrenaline which real pros feel on the court! Tennis fans love it, NON-TENNIS FANS LOVE IT! Check out our GenCon public feedback video in the Review section below.\nTry it to believe it! Our trial PnP is FREE for you to download. Support us for just about 20 USD, and you can own what we will be hoping is going to be the top Sports Tabletop game of the year 2017!\nDOWNLOAD THE FREE PnP HERE: CLICK HERE\nDownload the game manual here: CLICK HERE\nThis game has great depth, but can still be taught in under 5 minutes. Don't believe us? Here is a tutorial video teaching the game, in exactly 2 minutes and 30 seconds:\nOur Pink Meeple team dedicated an episode to show an actual game of Sweet Spot. No worries, the humor is there as always:\nOur friends over at Board To Death also made a really clear tutorial video for us just in case you prefer real life tutorial videos instead of animated one! Shouting it out here: THANKS GUYS!\nHighly Strategic\nPlayers have to play the right card at the right situation as they rally it out on the court. But beware \u2014 stamina management is a critical part of the game! If you are not careful enough, you might end up breathless too quickly. Sweet Spot uses a uniquely designed 'numbers system' to simulate the tennis ball's position and allows players to feel a realistic strength control of their swings where they can literally hit the ball lightly or drive it down hard. \nDuring games, you also need to decide your playing style! In between rallies, players are allowed to do a 'blind draft' of their hand using any combination of the 3 deck types available (Service, Tactic, Return) Many will want to lean towards the Tactic cards, which is really where the most powerful moves in the game are. However, they are risky because many of them rely on modifying Return cards, which are staple and a player without Return cards simply cannot react to even the simplest of balls! The trick is to manage that fine balance between having a lot of Tactic cards, and then enough Return cards to tide you through.\nPowerful Tactic cards can tilt the balance and are at the same time highly thematic - Bench allows one to regain more stamina in between rallies, Crowd Cheering allows one to perform better at critical moments and Egg Shot hits the ball so high in the sky that the opponent cannot take an accurate read on its position when it comes down.\nDOUBLES MODE\nYes, this game is fully compatible for a game of 2-on-2! It brings a different level of excitement. While it is highly tactical in Singles mode, it becomes very much more teamwork and communication in Doubles mode. The game plays exactly the same, except that players have a smaller hand size of 8 instead of the usual 10. Also they have to alternate hitting the ball on their teams. However, this restriction can be ignored if a player pays 2 extra stamina on top of his move requirement. This simulates the player going out of position and rushing over to assist. While players cannot share what cards they have with their teammate, they can talk and discuss on whether a player is able to 'handle' the current incoming shot better. In this manner, players of Sweet Spot can expect a realistic and highly exciting experience where a player can shout 'Let go!' or 'Mine!', only to find out that his partner was actually better equipped to handle it afterall - just like in real life! The better team is the one with better communication and teamwork!\nSOLO MODE\nYes and yes, we have revealed the SOLO mode! You can expect exciting battles against an AI player! This AI is no pushover, and will be sure to entertain you with intense matches whenever you are home by yourself!\nDownload the SOLO rules here: CLICK HERE\nA video sample of what a Solo mode session feels and plays like:\n   There are more than 100 cards and components in the game, including cubes and jumbo sized player cards - featuring more than 30 real Tennis moves and skills!\n We took this game for a ride at GenCon 2016, with complete strangers and public players. This video captures their feedback in pure verbatim...\nEduardo Review  \n\"This game absolutely blew my mind. This game is outstanding. I mean, this game is Outstanding. Outstanding!\" -Eduardo Baraf, publisher of Herbaceous\nUndead Viking Review\n\"Fun, challenging and exciting, Sweet Spot mirrors playing a tennis match without having to get up from the gaming table.\" -Undead Viking\nTantrum House Review\n\"One of our friends who really likes Tennis was able to pick up on some of the characters as likenesses of real players and even how some of their quirks and their habits were portrayed in the game.\" -Melissa Delp\n\"If you like head-to-head competition, I really do think you will enjoy Sweet Spot!\" -Kevin Delp\nFATHER GEEK FULLY APPROVED!\nSweet Spot won the hearts and minds of all 3 judging groups to get the honorable 'Approved' badge!\n\"The Gamer Geeks were surprised and delighted at how fast the game was played and the level of tactical and strategical thought it took to out play their opponents.\" -Father Geek Review\nFULL FATHER GEEK REVIEW HERE: CLICK HERE\nThis game has been featured by International tabletop magazine CASUAL GAMES REVOLUTION!\nLink to full review: CLICK HERE\n\"...Several moves can also be done in secret to surprise or psyche out opponents.

They are just hidden from the opposing team, that's all. (some misunderstand that the hidden cards only activate after they get revealed) What this means is that in the event you do bring the ball into 0-3 zone (IN) using the aid of a HIDDEN card, you do not hide it anymore. You immediately reveal that HIDDEN card along with any other cards you accompany it with - because you have already won. Similarly, if your HIDDEN card brings you into the 4-6(NET) zone, you also reveal it because you have already lost (so don't do that!) However, you still only pay for the stamina of the HIDDEN card after revealing it. This is where some players might find it confusing. What if you cannot pay for the stamina of the HIDDEN card when it gets revealed? Then that card does not happen at all. Simply discard it.

To stay up to date on the progress of Metal Minds, including how to purchase it in the future, visit and Like the Metal Minds Facebook Page.\n You are a psychic agent indentured to the government of the colonial planet, Kal-Purnika. While on a mission to harvest energy spheres called rift orbs in the Outer Stretch mountains, your team discovers abandoned power plants.\nA fierce competition ignites among you and the other agents for who can be first to restore the ruins to life. Construct intricate machines, perform telepathic feats and thwart the efforts of rivals in a race to create rift orbs. Become the greatest Metal Mind and forge a path to victory!\n    Metal Minds is easy to learn but takes time and skill to master. Players take turns drawing and playing cards to use agent and device powers. Your goal: Get the most rift orbs the fastest! \n    Each player gets a tracker mat with pawns to track resources and red gems to track rift orbs.\nAgents are also dealt randomly to each player at the start of a game. Agents have a power that can be used once a turn and assign limits to your hand size and devices in play.\nAll players draw from one deck called the inventory. It is made up of device and maneuver cards. The junkyard is the discard pile for inventory cards.\nCards you draw from the inventory are kept secret in your hand. You can only play cards from your hand. To discard a card means to place it from your hand into the junkyard.\nDevices you build are kept face-up in front of you in your line. You can only use the powers of devices in your line. To scrap a device means to place it from your line into the junkyard.\n  Maneuvers are blue cards that have an immediate but one-time effect. To play a maneuver, first pay its resource cost if it has one, perform its effect then place it in the junkyard.\nDevices come in two types: engines and gadgets. To play a device, first pay its cost if it has one then place it into your line. You can't use its powers until your next turn.\nGadgets are the green device cards that have scrap powers. A scrap power can only be used once then you must scrap the device.\nEngines are the red device cards that have circuit powers. A circuit power can be used once per turn. When you do, turn the card sideways to show it has been used that turn.\nThere are three types of resources used to play cards and use powers. They are mostly acquired from free inventory cards. You can carry up to six of each.\nTetracyte crystal is for playing gadgets and maneuvers.\nBilbadon lava fuel is used to make or destroy rift orbs.\nExorillium ore is for playing engines.\n  Each player gets one turn per round. A turn has three stages:\n1. Action stage\nSkip this stage to draw an extra card or get any two resources.\n* Play any number of cards from hand.\n* Use the powers of your agent and devices in your line.\n2.

Draw Stage\n* Turn all used cards upright.\n* Draw two cards from the inventory.\n  To win the game, you must end a round with at least eight rift orbs and have more than any of your rivals. If there is a tie among players for the most orbs, those players continue playing while the rest are eliminated.\n  Metal Minds has the dynamic game play of a collectible card game without the cost. Enough strategy is required to appeal to older and serious gamers, while enough luck is involved for younger and casual players.\nThe game has been tested rigorously for years and seen many iterations. The result is a fun experience with every card having a balanced power level.\nMetal Minds features an intriguing story and characters, with quality art from professional artists, including J.J. Sturgeon, Wayne Miller, Alan Vadell, Lin Norris and Toma Feizo Gas.\n  Please make the publication of Metal Minds a reality and pledge for your copy today! Here are five of the eight different pledge options available.\n  If you purchase the Kal-Purnika Citizen pledge level or higher, you may also pledge for any of the following add-on items.

If this game becomes available to stores, it will be a 140 card version without the player mats/EZ star tracker cards. And no expansions will be available in stores. Now is the time. The time is now. \nDon't be fooled by imitations. This is THE Battle of the Bands card game. We did it first, we do it best. \nBattle of the Bands is, an all ages, fun, \"screw you\" type card/dice game for 2-6 players. (with expansions, up to 12 players!) Start your band and destroy your opponents onstage! (And win, if you need to do that sort of thing.)\nOne box to rock them all!\n                  The play mats, that come with the game, help new players get into the swing of things. Not needed to actually play the game.\nAll of the 7 mini expansions we attain will be added to the Basic Set, making it possible for it to be 200 cards in the box. (42 cards in the mini expansions, we'll add 18 to make it an even 60 to the basic set of 140!) A DELUXE BASIC SET! (MSRP $39.95) And along the way we'll have up to 10 unique Kickstarter funder cards added to your box.\nIt's a card/dice game (Very soda and pretzels.) where everyone starts their own rock band. Players recruit BAND MEMBERS and INSTRUMENTS. They attempt to give them REPUTATIONS. \nPlayers play CONTRACTS, HIT SINGLES (win points) that might help them during GIGS, (win points) where they attempt to screw up the opposing bands with MONKEY WRENCHES. \nThe MUSIC BIZ will either make or break you when you are not touring, WEBSITES give a little extra when you have hit singles and the audience DIE ROLL has the last say in pushing you over the top! ( Very simple mechanics with lots of strategy in the card play.) \nAlso included are EZ Star Tracker cards that allow each player to know instantly where their opponent's Superstar point totals are in relation to winning the game! \n For a basic idea of how the game is played, click the link below and get the demo version!\nAt the top right hand of the page is a button with 3 dots, drop that down, the download button is there.\n  I am the game designer and artist on this game. It has been a labor of love, ink and sweat. If you ever wanted to be in a band, you will love this game. This was my first game and will always be my favorite. (I have made other games, FYI.)  \n Here's what some folks have said about Battle of the Bands...\n                            This game is supposed to be personal, when you play, it's YOUR band!  Creative role playing always makes any game more fun, especially this game!\nEXAMPLE:\nWhen someone steals your MOM from your band into their band, it's YOUR MOM! (And that reputation of ANDROGYNY they put on her... NOT COOL! ) When your opponent feels it's a good thing to expose you on TV, making your reputation NEGATIVE, you need to feel it. Role play it. It's a FUNNY game!!!\nThis game has been produced twice, the first time in 2000, the ENCORE edition, in 2002, where the basic set AND the expansion BACKSTAGE PASS were nominated for best traditional card game and expansion by ORIGINS! Now we've remastered it, this version is the best yet! \nThe deck is split into 2 decks now: The RESOURCES (red) deck are the red cards that pertain to your band-BAND MEMBERS, INSTRUMENTS, WEBSITES  and REPUTATIONS. You need stuff for your band? Draw from this deck.\nThe EVENTS (blue) deck are all the other cards, MUSIC BIZ, HIT SINGLES, CONTRACTS, GIGS and MONKEY WRENCHES. You want ammo for the tour, you draw from this deck.\nSEX, DRUGS & ROCK & ROLL, BACKSTAGE PASS, FRONT ROW CENTER and WANT ADS, all 50 card full expansions, will be available during the campaign at reduced prices. They will list at $14.95 in stores, you will be able to get them for $10. (If we can get enough people interested in supporting this gig!) So spread the word, or get some as holiday gifts!! (We ship in December!) Probably November, if all goes well.\nIF YOU ARE A RETAILER, YOU WILL GET ANY EXPANSIONS WE ATTAIN, FREE. BASED UPON YOUR FUNDING LEVEL, YOU WILL GET MULTIPLE SETS OF EACH EXPANSION. EX: 10 BASIC SET LEVEL= 10 S,D&R&R EXPANSIONS. \nAll 4 full 50 card expansions are available! SEX, DRUGS, ROCK & ROLL, BACKSTAGE PASS, FRONT ROW CENTER and WANT ADS! Just add $10 to your rewards for each set you want to include to your game. If you choose to buy all 4 sets, you will receive an additional 16 Kickstarter exclusive cards, TBD!\nTo order any options, You go to the manage your pledge button. You then add the amount to your starting pledge and after the campaign, the backer survey will ask you which options you ordered.\n   I have been lining up some of the finest artists in their fields to be a part of this campaign by doing a TOUR BOOK! Jeff Weigel (DRAGON GIRL, ATOMIC ACE, SPHINX), Karl Altstaetter ( X-MEN, UNCANNY X-MEN , DEITY, ME2), Drew Edward Johnson (THE SHIELD, MIDNIGHT SOCIETY, WONDER WOMAN), John Zeleznik (Cover artist for RIFTS, SHADOWRUN, GURPS) ... more to come! (Look these people up if you don't know who they are... they are my gods.) And you will receive an additional 24 Band Member cards that can be used in the game, drawn by the tour book artists!\n                           Also, for all of our $30+ funders, they will receive up to 10 special cards that will only be available to funders! (You are special and you deserve to be treated as such.)  And if we get at least 50 stores to support us, I will not sell Battle of the Bands online via me or Amazon until 2018! (If we get 50 stores to support us at the SUPER BRICK and MORTAR LEVEL, we will essentially have funded this puppy to the max, so if you have a local store who sells games, point them here...) So you can only get them from brick and mortar stores in 2017!) Here's one of the ten special cards to look at...\n        These make up the rest of the 200 cards in the basic set!\n                                                                                                                          And finally, because we LOVE Bowie, one of the mini sets is a Ziggy Stardust set that pertains to his legacy as the spider from Mars. (He's almost as popular as Mr. Cuddles!)\nHe was the Nazz, with god given -bleeeeppp-\n So, welcome back my friends, to the show that never ends.

The original tier had incorrect shipping being added.\nAnd be sure to check out the awesome Add-Ons being offered below! Includes discounted copies of the game :)\n      Game of Energy is a highly thematic eurogame of medium-light complexity. The primary mechanics are tile placement and resource management. It plays 1-4 players, and usually lasts around 30-60 minutes.\n  In a few years, the modern world will plunge into turmoil. Countries around the world will panic, widespread chaos will ensue, and civilized society will change virtually overnight as citizens cope with the loss of a modern-day vital resource. A resource needed for commerce. A resource needed for communication. A resource needed for life-sustaining technology. The resource\u2026 is energy.\nBut that time is not here yet! The United Nations cannot fix this problem themselves, but they know who can: the Captains of Industry. These people are experienced with building energy industries, and they are just the ones to solve this problem before time runs out! They are more than willing to do their best to save the world from this crisis. Of course, the resulting United Nations contract worth billions of dollars awarded to the Captain that accomplishes this task does not hurt, either...\nCompete with other players to win the contract and ensure that your company will become the #1 global energy power for many years to come! Obtain government industry permits by using energy credits allotted by the United Nations Council for aligning yourself to their environmental objectives. Industries you own will constantly increase the energy credits you are allotted, but they also increase the terawatt-hours, TWh (energy) generated by your company! And it is ultimately out-performing your opponents and hitting the optimal level of terawatt-hours that will win you the U.N. contract, and win you the game!\nBecome one of the Captains of Industry\n    Be careful which cards you play! Not all cards only affect your opponents.\n                                                                        Simple rules, but in-depth strategy.\nOverview\nYou are a captain of industry, and your job is to thwart the fast-approaching energy crisis. Regardless which captain of industry you become, you will have a unique ability that can be used on every turn of the game. Some abilities net you a better return on certain industries, others allow you to manipulate cards and other game components.\nAs a captain of industry, you have access to all modern day technologies: biofuel, fossil fuel, hydroelectric, nuclear, solar, and wind--all of which have different sizes, costs, and benefits. Each player must make optimum use of their resources and the available hexagonal areas on the board to not only achieve a victory with generating enough energy in terawatt-hours (TWh), which are your victory points in the game, but to do so before time runs out and world goes dark.\nIn every round of play, each player will take a single turn. During this turn, you will take a series of 3 actions: draw a Grid card (to be played strategically now or later), be \u201cpaid\u201d in the amount of energy credits shown on your environmental score track (this is a separate track from the TWh score track), and finally roll the territory die.\nUpon rolling the territory die, you can choose which combinations of industries you would like to build (\"permit\") in that zone of the board. Each zone presents a variety of different permitting costs for the available industries, but keeps all the environmental and TWh score track gains the same between zones--this makes it easier, but still realistic, to compare industries across zones, and also allows you the ability to quickly ascertain which industries have advantages/disadvantages depending on where you choose to build them. Your choices in what you build and when you build them determine your odds of victory in Game of Energy!\nText and Pictures only. Graphic Design and further refinement will come after the campaign.\n  Not yet updated with the newest components, but will certainly give you a positive gaming preview!\n  Not yet updated with the newest components, but will certainly give you a positive gaming preview!\n  End Game\nThe game ends when you reach the amount of TWh needed to assure your energy portfolio is a good model for what will rid the world of an impending energy crisis. Once you hit this limit, the remaining current round of play is played out. Assuming another player does not put you into energy credit debt OR surpasses you in TWh, you win!\nAnd be ever-watchful of the turn counter: once this hits 0, if nobody has reached the necessary amount of TWh generation, it means that there will be no more time left to build up the world's energy infrastructure! This is game over for everybody. Civil unrest is on your shoulders...\nAlternate Rules (including Solo Play)\nThere exist alternate rules in the game that allow for any (or all) of the following:\n+ Changing \"take that\" effects in the game (for a pure euro experience)\n+ Different goals for 2, 3, or 4 players\n+ Locking down industries where they are placed on the board (for advanced/heavier euro players)\n+ Filling in players with \"dummy players\" that play against you on the board\n+ Solo Variant that still gives the full game experience\nThe solo variant and dummy players can only be done through the use of the \"Dummy Corp.\" Expansion, which is included for FREE with the game when pledging here on Kickstarter!\nHow to Play\nIf you would like to see the story and setup of Game of Energy when it is sitting on your table, look no further than the video below!\nAnd if you would like to see details about gameplay of the base game (without your free Dummy Corp.

You can order multiples of the items below, too! We'll figure out the details later with a pledge manager :)\n         Shipping a fairly large and heavy 5.5 lbs. (2.5 kg) game is not cheap! But as an added benefit to the backers helping to build this crazy dream, everyone pledging gets subsidized shipping! And for the backers in Europe, no need to worry about extra customs charges: it will be shipped to you from INSIDE Europe!\nAll of these costs are automatically added when you select your pledge, so don't worry about doing any math here! This is merely for your reference to show you how shipping your game to you is handled :)\nIf you wish to look up two-letter country codes, you can find that here.\n    West-EU: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden\nCentral-EU: Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia\nAsia: China, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan\nWorld: All other countries not listed on the chart\nIf you have any questions on how to work out your shipping costs (which are NOT automatically added to your pledge), or if you are wondering why you are in one Location category as opposed to another, please message me on Kickstarter and we will work through it together! You just want to play the game! So let us make that happen :)\n\nImmediately following Kickstarter funding, the instructions will be redone by a professional, and graphic design will also commence. Both of these items will take 2-3 weeks at most from the time of commissioning to the final receiving.\nDepending on which stretch goals are met, there will be another art commission for the back of the board which will take 2-3 weeks as well. This will run concurrent with the instructions timeline above.\nThere are still a few cards to be refined and added to the Grid deck. The back of the box also needs to be updated slightly. Both of these combined will take less than a week, since this will be done by me personally.\nAs you can see, there isn't much more to do!\nBottom line: when you back this tabletop game, you're backing a finished tabletop game :)\n    Origins 2016\nHad such an amazing turnout at Origins! From beginning to end over the 4 days we were there, probably had both tables full 90% of the time, even during lunch hour! And I was thankful to see many of you from social media and LexiCon :)\n                  LexiCon 2016\nSuch an amazing convention! Love that I have such an awesome local convention to go and play with fellow gamers :)\n              Gen Con 2015\nSince the game looks so different now than it did, I don't want to confuse anybody with pictures showing the old version, so I just want to take the time to say thanks to all the people at Gen Con 2015!\nThis was the start of an amazing time demoing with the public! This was the convention where I first met Sam Healey, Chris Williams, and several other people that have just been AMAZING at helping to shape the game, including all the playtesters! Thank you everyone so much for the part you've played with changing the direction of the game to a very positive one :)\n  Big shout-out to those that played Game of Energy at GenCon 2015, LexiCon 2016, and Origins 2016; on Facebook and elsewhere; and offered up many streamlining and aesthetic suggestions to really make this game pop. Thanks everyone! Your suggestions were implemented, as I am sure you can tell! Backers: feel free to suggest!\nBig thank you to all the reviewers that took the time to review this game and post video or written reviews :) You can see all the reviewers in the \"Review\" section with the GIFs and text blurbs, and I HIGHLY recommend you start following them if you haven't yet. Quality stuff! They are who I get my reviews from for the large amount of games that are out there!\nGot to give another shout-out to the ones that made the project video: Paul Cosca and Brandon Garver! Fantastic work!\nAnd, of course, last, but CERTAINLY not least: the artists that have really gone above and beyond in making this game BEAUTIFUL! There have been several artists from around the world take part in this, but there is one in particular I have worked with for quite some time now, and he is AWESOME. That would be the very talented, professional, Vicente Sivera! Seriously, this guy is going to make it big in this business.

You are allowed to make the animal noise of the animal you are \"claiming,\" we have found that gets everyone laughing.\n   Setup:\n 1.) Place the 5 Animal Bonus cards in order of value (Cow, Pig, Sheep, Goat, Chicken).\n2.) Place the Set Bonus cards in a stack on the table.\n3.) Place 1 Robber and 1 Excuse Me Token in the middle of the table, face-down, for each player in the game and mix them up.

The dynamic duo, Jamey Stegmaier and James Mathe, good cop, and bad cop, without their resources; there is no way this campaign would be where it is.

The game is designed to minimize the need to memorize the state of the game, letting players play their cards as the box comes to them.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                     *French Translation (from an awesome backer - Etienne!)\n                                                           Keep up on Heroes and Tricks \n- Follow H&T on Facebook  \n- Follow Me (@ebaraf) on Twitter\nBoard Game Aggregators\n- H&T on BoardGameGeek.com\n- H&T on BoardGaming.com\nSleever Add-On\nWhile we couldn't accommodate sleeves in the game box (as its size is part of gameplay), we are able to provide a second, empty copy of the box with your shipment. You'll be able to play out of one of the boxes but store the game in the two. If you would like a second, empty box added to your pledge, add $10 for US and $12 for International.

To get fans, you'll utilize (spend) content to produce games tailored to their demands. To meet those demands, you'll develop content with help from the internet.\n\nWhen you meet the demands of the market, you get fans and a new recruit for your company. They join your media, design, production and/or graphics team where they help develop immersive worlds, deep mechanics, valuable components, and wondrous artwork - all the things you need to achieve success.\n\nTo succeed, not only will you need to get the best people, but you'll have to recruit them before anyone else.\nMeeple Maker is for those times when you want:\nTo play a 90 minute game in 45 minutes.\nChoices to matter, but not overwhelm.\nGoals to be clear, but strategies flexible.\nA big box game in a small box space.\nA competitive worker placement game, without the grunt work.\nThe game provides many decisions to make and many paths to take. Your goal is to make sure the path you choose provides you with the most fans. Players take turns either:\nMoving their tokens on the board and gaining the content shown at the websites they move to,\nOR they spend content to gain cards. The cards each have a listed cost, and give you skills (which help generate more content) and fans (score).\nBut what if you don't like your options? Then change them! Collect special Favor cards to turn the game in your favor. You can play these multi-function cards at the start of your turns to change:\nThe market\nWebsites (the game board)\nYour content\nThe right combination at the right time can be a game-changer.\nNeed to develop content for your games? Then visit a website that offers the content you want.\nYou'll always have three websites to choose from - each with a unique and changing combination of content.. Players skip over other players, simultaneously blocking websites and opening up new ones.\nWant more fans and a bigger company? Then utilize your content to get yourself into a new market! Produce the type of game they want, and they'll bring fans and a skillful new employee. Those skills help with developing content and achieving the end-game bonuses.\nThus, you'll have several factors to consider:\nThe type and amount of content they demand,\nHow many fans and skills they give you,\nHow much those skills are worth at the end of the game,\nWhere to recruit from.\nEvery time your company grows, the market changes, so choose carefully!\nAs companies grow, it gets tougher to develop content without a strong team. In the game, players mimic this by choosing one token to flip at a time, gradually turning up the pressure. When the last has been turned, time's up! l hope your company has what it takes to grab the last few fans and lead you to victory!\nGreat price point! Why wait for the retail price of $39, when you can back now for $29?\nLimited distribution This is a small print-run game (1,000 copies) which will be sold directly online and at conventions after Kick Starter. Be one of the rare few to own it.\nKeep in touch with the scheduled online games and try it before you buy it.\nIf you enjoy games like Lords of Waterdeep, Istanbul, and Stone Age, and want something quicker and smaller, then Meeple Maker will fit right into your collection. \nThe game is designed to be engaging and speedy with little waiting and downtime. There is no round to round management since:\nYou don't need to take my word for how great a game this is. Here are the links to previews.

To keep the manufacturing costs low, I had to keep two sets of characters out. These two player mats (with their own powers) are ready and waiting for when we reach our funding and push towards stretch goals.\nWhen you bring out this game, you'll be proud in the knowledge that you made this game a reality.\nI am the driving force behind Meeple Maker. But there have been dozens that helped. Many are friends from the Dallas Games Marathon, the Dallas Designer Group, or numerous conventions I've attended. Thank you for being a part of my journey - this game is for you.\nMeeple Maker at Dallas Games Marathon\nFor Meeple Maker, I'm self-publishing because I want to experience publishing a game. My long term goal is to use this experience to help others.\nThe art and graphic design, the audio and video, the game design and development, the prototypes - from cards, to chits, to boxes, the folding boards- I've created them all on a shoe-string budget. Every challenge has strengthened my resolve to make this the best game it can be.\nMeeple Maker at the Dallas Designer Group", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've faced and overcome many risks and challenges. Meeple Maker has been playtested (and blind playtested) rigorously. The majority of the files are ready to be sent to the manufacturer for final proofing, although some final artwork will be created and adjusted. Even the most seasoned publishers deal with manufacturers, distributors, shipping companies, postal services, government regulations etc. \u2013 all of which can create unexpected changes. I have alternative plans for each step and I\u2019ve built in a little breathing room in the funding to deal with any problem that may arise.\n\nI support and follow many similar projects, and have since early 2013. I've paid attention to their problems and how they've resolved them. I'm also a long-standing member of the Dallas Designer Group - which has helped produce games like Dragon Valley, Mage Wars, Lanterns, World's Fair 1893, The Great Debate, Mahola and others. I've helped many in conventions and through their KS projects. I'm confident that should any issues arise I have the right team to advise me on the best solutions.\n\nShipping is always a concern - especially since it will be months before shipping occurs and price, policy and tax issues may change. Should any such issues occur, I will inform those that it affects and discuss how best to proceed. I've alternate plans prepared for this.\n\nCommunication is vitally important.

This will affect the project in several ways:\n\n1) To make this work and still be cost-effective, I am making small changes to the game to fully utilize standardized pieces and sizes. The effect on gameplay should be minimal, but the changes need to be tested. We may even end up with a better game as the constraints spur creativity.\n2) I will not be able to offer cost-effective shipping for international backers for a Print-on-Demand print-run, but the long-term plan is to have a larger print-run which will be friendlier to international backers.\n3) The print-run size will be closer to 100 than 1,000. As a result, it will have a significantly lower funding goal.\n\nMy hope is to create enough copies to send out to my backers and have several more remaining to send to reviewers as well.

Players choose from a number of core character classes and explore dangerous locations full of monsters, treasures, and deadly boss fights.\nDesigned specifically for the Dark Souls\u2122 universe and introducing a number of innovative gameplay mechanics, with world-class miniatures faithful to the rich universe, this game delivers an experience that captures the very essence of the original video games.\nClick here for Dark Souls\u2122 - The Board Game 101\nWe don\u2019t like complicated Kickstarters, so we\u2019ve made this one as simple as possible. There is just one pledge level for gamers, and one pledge for retail stores.\nAs the campaign progresses, some stretch goals will unlock an \u2018Add-On\u2019 which is an optional item to purchase; to buy one of these, simply increase your pledge amount. This also drives the campaign total up thereby unlocking even more stuff!\nThe best bit is that every 'non Add-On' stretch goal that gets unlocked during the campaign will be included in your pledge! So the more people that support the project, the more goals get unlocked, the more value we can squeeze in, and the bigger the box we're going to need!\nRead the FAQ Here\nClick here to read the first AMA with Mat Hart, one of the Game's Designers.\nClick here to read the second AMA with Mat Hart.\nClick here to read the third AMA with Mat Hart.\nClick here to read the Reddit AMA with Mat & Rich\nClick here to read the fourth AMA with Richard Loxam\nDark Souls\u2122 - The Board Game is much more than a classic dungeon crawler. Just like the Dark Souls\u2122 video games, this is a game that requires strategic thinking, clever planning, and exemplary execution to succeed.\nDragon Slayer Ornstein & Executioner Smough\nTo triumph, players must explore dangerous locations, discover and defeat enemies, and collect equipment and treasures before ultimately facing the boss in an epic fight to the death.\nThe Player Characters - Knight, Warrior, Herald & Assassin\nPlayable in either Solo or Co-op modes, players choose their role from a number of core Dark Souls\u2122 character classes. Each class has a distinct role to play in the game, with a unique set of strengths and abilities.\nWith multiple difficulty modes and a high-level of replayability, this is a game designed to be deep enough to satisfy hard-core tabletop gamers whilst remaining accessible to newer players.\nDark Souls\u2122 - The Board Game features an exciting \"fast setup, long reveal\" mechanic that gets you into the game faster and builds the location and encounters as you explore.\nWith no fixed scenario layouts, it\u2019s as simple as choosing the direction to explore, placing a new tile down and flipping a card from the Encounter deck.\nEach time you decide where to go, you will experience a new danger as you explore, with each new location a real risk to your hard-won progress. If you die, then you drop everything you have collected and reappear at the nearest bonfire. So do you return to the bonfire to rest and spend Souls to strengthen up, but in doing so fully reset the locations? Or do you press on and pray that the next encounter isn\u2019t beyond your capabilities? After all, the next location may contain a clue to the Boss and how to defeat them\u2026\nCombat is both fast and deadly. Dark Souls\u2122 - The Board Game rewards clever players and punishes \u2018button mashing\u2019. Players must learn enemy behaviors in order to fight more effectively, with classic fighting game style combat windows. \nThe Titanite Demon mini-boss\nThe game features a \u201cdynamic positioning system\u201d which makes combat fluid and ever-changing. With the game state constantly shifting as combatants move around the battlefield, players must stay alert to danger and opportunities. \nEquipment, armour, and weapons are discovered or earned during play, but with limited slots players must think carefully about what is best to keep and use. Using a simple stamina management system, players can potentially leave themselves exhausted and vulnerable. Death is usually swift to follow a poor decision in combat.\nThe Dancer of the Boreal Valley boss accompanied by a group of Hollow\nUsing our advanced miniatures development pipeline and working with one of the finest board game manufacturers in the world, the quality and detail in the miniatures is world-class. With the entirety of the Dark Souls\u2122 universe available to use, one of the hardest decisions has been to narrow down which enemies and bosses to include in the core game.\nThe Gargoyle mini-boss\nThe Core Game contains:\n3 Boss Models\n5 Mini-Boss Models\n4 Player Character Models\n4 Large Grunt Models\n12 Grunt Models\n7 Double Sided Game Tiles\n2 Double Sided Mini-Boss/Boss Tiles\n4 Player Character Boards\n3 Boss Dials for Tracking Damage\n60 Equipment Cards\n40 Treasure Cards\n26 Boss AI Cards\n36 Encounter Cards\n15 Coloured Dice\n100+ Game Tokens\nPrepare to Die...\nCheck out the prototype Boss Fight versus the Dancer of the Boreal Valley and people's reactions to it...\nAdd-Ons will unlock as the campaign progresses.

These double sided tiles will feature artwork from the Darkroot Basin and Iron Keep environments from the game and will allow backers more options of exploration during their game play sessions.\nPlease NOTE that they are NOT required in order to use the Darkroot Basin/Iron Keep Expansions.\nYou can also purchase multiple Souls Pledges by increasing your pledge amount by +\u00a380 per pledge. NOTE: There is no Early Bird discount on these additional pledges. The 'Extra Souls Pledge' gets you a second copy of the Core Game with Applicable Stretch Goals.\n\"A lot of the minutia is even the same, like bosses changing attack patterns midway through battle (which is true of Dark Souls 3 at any rate), and you heal up using carefully managed Estus Flasks.

This project is our first step towards changing this for the retailers.\nSteamforged Games Ltd are determined to support retail at every level. With our previous project - Guild Ball, we committed that after the project had launched all further products within the range would be direct to retail. We kept that promise. With Dark Souls\u2122 - we go one step further and are building support directly into the Kickstarter itself.\nThe Retailer Pledge level contains 6 copies Dark Souls\u2122 - The Board Game along with a number of other benefits:\nRetailer Bonus Unlocks - We have built into the Kickstarter several additional retailer bonus unlocks that once unlocked (via the number of retail backers in the campaign) will provide 'Add-On' purchases available only at retail and not purchasable during the Kickstarter by backers. These will not be limited runs but a general release available to all customers upon launch of the game in shops.\nCurrent Bonus Unlock Items\nExclusive Timed Access - You will be the first stores to receive the Core Game and the only stores to have 4 weeks early access to the launch day products and retailer exclusive stretch goal products upon release.\nExclusive Point of Sale Items - Along with your retail stock, we will send exclusive point of sale items as a thank you for supporting us from the start.\nTo help retailers guarantee their initial stock, you may purchase additional Retailer Pledges by increasing the pledge amount.\nWe will be supporting localisation options for the game and have confirmed the following languages currently: \nEnglish\nFrench\nSpanish\nGerman\nItalian\nWe are also considering other localisation options depending on demand during and after the Kickstarter campaign ends. You will be able to choose the language of your version via the pledge manager system.\nShipping will be charged after the Kickstarter finishes based on actual costs incurred to ship and is collected via our pledge manager system. This allows us to charge fairly for all backers and avoid a 'one size fits all' mentality to shipping. \nWe will ship your pledges to several hubs around the world at our cost. Your pledge will arrive via one of the following hubs: \nUnited Kingdom (UK and Rest of the World backers)\nUSA (US backers)\nCanada (Canadian backers)\nGermany (EU backers)\nChina (Asia Pacific backers)\nAustralia (Australia and New Zealand backers)\nBelow are our initial rough estimates for shipping the core game (4kg volumetric weight).

UK/RoW orders are sent to the UK hub by sea freight.\n2-5 Weeks - China sends EU/AUS/US hub orders prepacked by sea freight. Asian hub orders begin packing and shipping.\n6-8 Weeks - UK hub receives items and begins packing and shipping\n9-12 Weeks - EU/AUS/US hubs receive items, ship everything out to backers within 2 weeks.\n13+ Weeks - UK hub completes shipping of the UK and RoW orders.

But be careful, word has it that the other Nobles have hired their own unsavory agents, so you will need to summon Escorts (shields) to try and keep the roads clear of threats to your Envoys.\nAs the turns progress, players must remember what Vassals have already been sent to court and predict which ones will be sent out next.

Originally released in 2003 by Fleer as Ophidian 2350, a company best known for its sports cards and bubble gum, the game found itself treading water in a market flooded with other new card games. Since its release Ophidian has stood apart by offering players an unusually high number of strategic options during gameplay. Unfortunately, its publisher went out of business shortly after the game's release, and all of Fleer's assets were either sold off or destroyed. Most people assumed the game was finished.\nRobert Shofkom, Hack and Slash Games President\nUS Army Veteran Robert Shofkom tracked down the inventory over 10 years after its release, where it had been passed around from warehouses to storage units.

And now I'm about to start my 5th year of filming! WOOHOO!!! \nYou can check out my series at\nYOUTUBE.COM/RAHDO\nAs a sampler, here's a playlist of some recent runthroughs I've done (click \"playlist\" in the top left to see a long list of video choices):\nI make these videos primarily for fun, as a way of sharing my enthusiasm and passion for the boardgaming hobby, and helping like-minded board game geeks choose which of the myriad games on the market are right for them. \nBut as it happens, as of 2013, I've retired from full-time employment, and now, to be able to continue to produce runthrough videos, I need to raise funds to cover my operating expenses (game purchases, travel expenses to game conventions, and a salary to be able to stay devoted 100% to the show).\nFan Support Makes it all Possible\nThat's where you come in, because I receive no direct income for Rahdo Runs Through except for fan support in these yearly fund raising drives. I accept no payments from game developers for any game (retail or Kickstarter prototype) that I run through, and I don't turn on YouTube ads (because they're awful), so you folks are truly what keeps Rahdo running through! :)\nJust a few of the many games that could be coming soon, with your help...\nBy backing this, my fourth RAHDO RUNS THROUGH Kickstarter campaign, you're funding my ability to continue to produce videos of all the latest, hottest games, ranging from the big games of the moment like Runebound 3rd Edition and Steam Time, to the soon to be released hits like Pandemic: Reign of Cthulhu and Star Trek Frontiers.\nIn return for your donation, you have access to a variety of rewards. What are they, you might be wondering?  I'm glad you asked...\nTHE BACKER REWARDS\nRahdo Runs Through VOTING!

Join a secret society!\nMEGA GLASS!!!!\nAs you can see from these pictures, there's a lot of options for backer rewards in this campaign, and I'm using an a'la carte WILDCARD system to let people choose what combination of them they'd like. \nFor more details, here's a quick video where I show/talk about the various rewards and explain how the WILDCARD reward system works:\n\nTHE STRETCH GOALS \nOkay, so the target goal for this year basically covers all the new games I'll be acquiring to film, another trip to Essen for more convention coverage and a basic salary for me and Paulo Renato (the fine fellow who fact checks and annotates all my vids... Paulo is l'awesome and keeps me honest!). But, if we go above and beyond the target, below is some additional content that can be provided over the next 12 months!\nStretch Goal #1: Jen Runs Through ($35,000)\nRahdo Runs Through is mostly a one-man show, but people do love it when my lovely wife Jen makes appearances to help me play and demonstrate the games (rather than my normal \"virtual\" Jen gaming partner!) \nOf course, it's time consuming to film runthroughs, and that takes her away from her actual career of making beautiful glass art. But, if we hit this first stretch goal, Jen will commit to appearing in 12 runthroughs over the course of the year (roughly once each month), and I can tell you right now, the shows she's in are always the most fun to watch! \nTo give you an idea of what a Jen-enhanced video is like, here's a playlist of all the videos she's been in to date: http://jen.rahdo.com\nStretch Goal #2: Rahdo Talks Through, the Podcast ($40,000)  \nHitting this stretch goal means I'll continue my monthly Golden Geek Award-nominated podcast series which started last year (no kidding, I almost won an award!!!) where I talk about exciting upcoming games, revisit top10 topics to delve further, and answer plenty of questions (joined each month by Jen).\nYou can subscribe to the series here: http://podcast.rahdo.com\nStretch Goal #3: Rahdo Runs Through LIVE! ($45,000)\nSo, last year marked my first foray into the world of YouTube live-casting runthroughs and Q&A sessions, and they seemed to go over very well, with 6 events being aired bi-monthly. There's a fair bit of work in setting these up, but if we hit this stretch goal, I'm up for filming 6 more this year!  \nHere's a playlist of last year's live events to see what they're like!\nStretch Goal #4: LeiriaCon! ($50,000)\nLeiriaCon is a very popular convention held in Portugal every January, and it just so happens that my fact check/annotations guy Paulo always attends. So if we hit this, I will attend also, cover the convention, and film some video with Paulo, which I think will be a lot of fun. We'll see if he makes as much fun of me in real life! And Jen's schedule permitting, she'll come along as well and get in the team-up videos also!\nStretch Goal #5: Periscope School ($55,000)\nA live monthly broadcast via Periscope where I teach Jen (and anyone watching) how to play a new game (see latest update for more details)\n\"Thanks for watching, talk to you later, so long, buh bye!\"", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI'm not really anticipating any particular challenges or risks - other than maybe laryngitis!

We understand the responsibilities and dedication that is required to run a business, and are ready to tackle any unforeseen challenges that could occur along the way. Our primary risks at this point lie in manufacturing and shipping. \n\nWe have established a solid relationship with WinGo Games, a reputable manufacturer that is trusted within the industry. We have ensured that all of our questions have been answered ahead of time, so we know exactly what to expect from WinGo, and WinGo knows what to expect from us as well. \n\nWe will work diligently on our end to ensure the final art and graphic files are completed and delivered on time, and according to WinGo's specifications as to avoid potential delays and other issues. There are some things that will be out of our hands during the manufacturing process, such as labor force fluctuations, Chinese holidays, etc. We have taken those things into consideration, and have given ourselves an extra cushion of time for things that could occur beyond our control. \n\nWe have carefully planned our logistics, and have established correspondence with fulfillment companies around the world, which we feel confident in handling our shipments from the factory to your doorstep when that time comes. \n\nGetting this game in your hands and in perfect condition, within the stated delivery time is our primary focus and concern. We will work swiftly to resolve any issues in manufacturing and shipping, should they occur. We will be transparent with you at all times, and let you know right away when an issue occurs, what that issue is, and how we intend to resolve it.

Otherwise, the only other option for those small handful of backers will be for me to ship their game individually from the US, which is very expensive, but I\u2019ll do what I have to do to ensure they are taken care of.\nOn another note, I haven\u2019t forgotten about those of you who need . The list is relatively small for those who reported damages and missing parts, but it\u2019s still a complicated undertaking, as many of those who need replacement parts are in other parts of the world. If I could incorporate Jamey Stegmaier\u2019s approach to handling this part of the operation it would be ideal, but I don\u2019t have the scale or resources (people who can readily ship out replacements in different parts of the World) being such a small company.

In this 3 part video series, I will be showing you exactly how to setup and play Dungeon Crusade. From the very start, and into gameplay. I think it is paramount to show you for one, Dungeon Crusade is not a complex game, and second what I mean by  \"open world dungeon crawl board game\". Part 2 will be on shortly. But for now, enjoy learning about Dungeon Crusade! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gce8d4N-h0c\n Hello all!  We are preparing the \"How to setup and play Dungeon Crusade\" video right now. In the meantime, sit back, relax, pop some popcorn and enjoy the world debut showcase video. This was shot about a month ago, and the game is in a ever changing state of refinement and fine tuning to make it top notch. We hope you enjoy the Dungeon Crusade showcase video! :)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VEQ85-VqZs\n Here is a great demo of the Avalon Adventure board game for you guys to check out. Enjoy!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xytSQ5G55sw&feature=youtu.be\n     In forming Groovus Games Unlimited, I wanted this company to stand for 3 things that are paramount to me. Honesty, quality and quantity.  \n     Honesty in the form of showing backers as much of the game as I can, being straightforward with what content is being presented.\n      If you notice to the side, there are \"create a hero\" packages. There is NO up-charge for this. This will never happen at Groovus Games Unlimited. Instead, I'm honored and thrilled to have backers use their creativity and imagination to give these heroes names and backstories, and have the backer's name on the hero card for their contribution to the game. You simply can't put a price tag on that. Well, some people do, but at Groovus Games Unlimited, we want you to keep your money and just worry about creating with us, helping to make an awesome game that is truly \"ours.\" \n      Quality and Quantity. Very rarely do you see these two things together, but with our first launch title, that is what we are striving to give our fellow gamers. The quantity you can clearly see below. The quality will come from the fairly huge development team that has been assembled for the Dungeon Crusade project. People from all around the world are committed, determined and focused on bringing this game to fruition for everyone to enjoy. \n     Lastly, with Groovus Games Unlimited, we don't believe in producing \"exclusive\" content with high price tags and in limited quantity. It's our belief that everyone should have a right to enjoy ALL of the content that is offered across the board equally at a great price point. So in closing, enjoy the Dungeon Crusade campaign, and I hope the game meets or exceeds your expectations. Have a great time all! Rodger \"Groovus\" Deering \n The world's first open world dungeon crawl board game, Dungeon Crusade is a hybrid game inspired by two of the golden ages of gaming, which are board games and computer RPG's of years past. Built from the ground up for solo or co-op play.  \n      Take control of 6 legendary heroes and their trusty fetch-hound, Albus, as they set out in a massive, open world dungeon to complete quests for villagers, find ancient treasure chests that may be empty, trapped or full of loot, pick locks on secret rooms, gain lifeforce, mine for minerals to craft powerful gems for their gear, find crates to smash open, plus new encounters every turn for the heroes to experience. Enjoy gifts from the villagers on celebration day, shop in the village, and gamble at the house of chance. Experience a \"living dungeon\" with the exclusive game mechanic the \"patrol route system\", where monsters move through the dungeon with unpredictable and random movement patterns. Battle minions who are attempting to raid the village, fight the champions who lurk in the chambers of the dungeon, and come face to face with the guardians of the dungeon, all while trying to clear the quest tables to achieve victory and save the village! So prepare thyself, hero, for a game of epic proportions where strategy, tactics and planning are a must. I personally welcome each and every one of you to Avalon, to enjoy a creative evolution in game design. This is Dungeon Crusade!\nOur rogue hero is about to ambush a pesky minion!\nEnjoy open world dungeon crawling in Dungeon Crusade! Experience the concept of a \"living dungeon\" with monsters who roam through out the dungeon, while the heroes are questing within it's depths.\nTo win, pick a scenario from the scenario booklet or create your own scenario. After setting up the game as the scenario describes, the heroes goal is to clear the 3 quest tables, which will turn the elder globes upon the tables from red to a green status, indicating there is purity within the dungeon. When all 3 elder globes have a green status, the heroes have won that scenario, and saved the village!\nClose the books on the quest table by completing quests. When the books on the table have been closed, flip the elder globe to the reverse side.\nWelcome to Dungeon Crusade! 1 of 4 gameworlds being shown\n *Reaper Miniatures miniatures are being used without permission and are only examples of the type of models that will be included.

No two games are ever the same!\nThe Avalon Adventure Board Game is played before you play Dungeon Crusade. The heroes must recover the 3 magical runes that are randomly placed around Avalon at the start of the game. Once they are recovered, proceed to the dungeon and shatter the curse on the dungeon doors. Complete mini quests and attribute tests, acquire gear and loot, fight monsters, get into trouble in the villages and much more. No two games are ever the same. So get ready heroes, to embark on a grand adventure across Avalon!\n   Shop at the village on celebration day, or send the hero\u2019s fetch-hound, Albus, to the village to fetch items for the heroes while they are in the dungeon. Heal at the temple, recover essence at the inn, craft gems and buy gear at the blacksmith, visit the academy to level up or acquire new abilities, visit the bazaar to restock on potions and torches, and finally, gamble at the House of Chance. Yes...Dungeon Crusade has it's own gambling hall for the heroes! ;)\n   Now enjoy some screenshots of the features and exclusive content that Dungeon Crusade will provide players with.  \nEach hero is proficient in 2 of the 6 warfare types. Notice the sliders for keeping track of health and essence.\nAt the start of a game, random crates are placed within certain chambers of the dungeon. Smash open crates to see what they hold!\nOn celebration day, a hero can receive a blessing from the village's temple. Sometimes your prayers will go unheard, other times angels will come to a hero's aid in his time of need.\nWhen the heroes clear a quest table, it's time for celebration day in the village! The villagers will bestow a gift upon the heroes for their help.\nWelcome to the monster deck section of Dungeon Crusade. There is a total of 87 monsters right now in the game, 45 being unique. And yes, this total WILL grow.\nHere we see the heroes combating a champion monster within a chamber. A hero can \"rally\" up to 2 other heroes to fight alongside him. Build a party of heroes to take on the evils of the dungeon!\nThe colored dice represent the 6 different types of warfare in Avalon. Building a party of heroes that complement each other, is essential to slaying the creatures & monsters that reside within the dungeon.\nAn innovative and fresh quest system will provide players with a sense of uncertainty and randomness in every game. Players will never be sure of what kind of monsters lurk behind the chamber doors, guarding the valuable quest items.\nOpen world dungeon crawling. Go where you want, do what you want!\nOur warrior hero decides to go off to a remote part of the dungeon without his companions. Watch out hero! Dreadthorn, one of the guardians is heading down the hallway straight for you!\nA group of minions are gathered in the southwestern part of the dungeon. Possibly one or more of them could convert from being a vagrant minion into a raiding minion, and will head off to the village to raid it!\nDungeon Crusade also offers mining & crafting. Buy a pickaxe from the village and mine for minerals. But be warned, every game the mining sites change. Albus or the heroes must scout out where they are located in order to mine.\nHere we see the archer and rogue planning an attack on one of the 2 minions shown. They want to combine their warfare types to do as much damage as possible in hopes of slaying one of the minions.\nDiscover secret rooms in the dungeons of Dungeon Crusade. But hold on, little adventurer! These doors don't simply open, a hero must pick the lock to gain entrance to see what the chamber holds within.\nAt the top of the hierarchy of monsters, sit the guardians of Dungeon Crusade. These boss-like creatures can sense a hero when he gets within a certain radius. The creature will track him and attempt to end his life.\nEvery turn, every game, the encounter deck offers events, challenges and environment changes to keep players always guessing on what is going to come next at their heroes.\nIt would have been easy to just add text, and no art on the cards. But at Groovus Games Unlimited, we want our players immersed in the game, and make it a highly thematic experience for them.\n     As of right now, there are 112 encounter cards and more are on the way. At the start of every game, you shuffle the encounter deck and deal out 40 cards at random. This forms the encounter deck. Every game, you will have no idea what encounters the heroes will have to deal with. Surprises, randomness and whimsical gameplay is at the heart of Dungeon Crusade.\nThe Patrol Route System will offer the soloist and co-op gamer a truly new experience, with the notion of a \"living dungeon.\"\n      Created and developed exclusively for Dungeon Crusade, the patrol route system is a true break-through game mechanic and system that will give the soloist and co-op gamers the concept of a \"living dungeon.\" Creatures and monsters will have unpredictable movement causing them to roam freely throughout the dungeon, keeping the heroes always guessing where they will move next. Players will be forced to use strategy and tactics and plan their moves accordingly. You as the player, will never have to think for the monsters again.\nWelcome heroes! To the House of Chance!\n Another exclusive to Dungeon Crusade is the House of Chance located in the northwest part of the village. On celebration day, heroes can visit the house of chance and gamble on 4 different games in a attempt to win gold to spend in the village, before heading back down into the dungeon. So put your gold on the table, grab a mug of ale, and get playing in the House of Chance!  \nTower Attack. This game will be included in the base and crusader edition of Dungeon Crusade.\n In Tower Attack, the heroes must take the tower back from the evil skeleton army! Tower Attack is a dice pushing game where you have 3 attempts to match or exceed the numbers shown on the particular level the hero may be on. If a hero is unsuccessful, they are stuck on that level until it is beaten.\nHeroes vs. Monsters. This game will be a stretch goal that will unlock, and will be part of the crusader edition package.\n In Heroes vs. Monsters, the 3 heroes must defend the chapel of light against the advancing monsters. The heroes have action points that they can spend each turn to move and attack. If at least one monster makes it to the chapel of light, the heroes lose and must replay that level. There are 8 challenge cards with Heroes vs. Monsters, each challenge card becomes more difficult than the previous one.\nSkull Jack. This game will be a stretch goal that will unlock, and will be part of the crusader edition package.\nSkull Jack is a simple form of Black Jack. Up to 3 heroes can play. Bet 200 gold per hand. On a win, win your bet back, plus an additional 200 gold. One of the artists will be designing an exclusive set of playing cards that has the Dungeon Crusade theme. \nThe Adventures of Bravely the Knight. This game will be a stretch goal that will unlock, and will be part of the crusader edition package.\n In the game, The Adventures on Bravely the Knight, join Bravely as he descends into a monster filled, trap riddled dungeon in a attempt to plunder the gold within. Any gold that Bravely recovers, the heroes receive! So pick up your sword and shield and join Bravely on a tiny, yet epic dungeon crawl! \nJesse Hansen - Besides being the art director for heroes and monsters, Jesse is the founder of Cornerstone Creative Studios.

Let me explain.\n  When I look at kickstarter projects, I would like a system to learn the game in a quick, easy and fun way. Now Dungeon Crusade may look very complex, and it isn't at all. I designed Dungeon Crusade to have a sense of familiarity to it, and be very accessible to players. I want to get them into the game quick, and have them having fun in no time.\n    This system you will see below, I believe will get you acclimated to Dungeon Crusade very quickly and easily, and you'll have a fun time reading it. No tiny text, or anything ambiguous. Just easy to follow \"poster panels\" that will hopefully excite you, and teach you a majority of the game. \n   So sit back and relax! And enjoy the \"poster panel\" section. \nThe art of Shaun Ellis, lead artist for the game world of Dungeon Crusade. This is a great indication of the final look of the game with Shaun creating all of the different gameworld areas.\nBy hand, I crafted the land of Avalon with 50 different locations to give fellow gamers a truly immersive experience that is reminiscent of games such as Baldur's Gate, Might & Magic and the Ultima series.\nThe massive loot deck of Dungeon Crusade. 190 loot cards just in the base edition, plus MUCH more in the form of stretch goals.\nA evil force has risen in the land of Avalon, and your heroes will come face to face with The Blackhand Army.\nShaun Ellis. Lead artist for the game world and loot for Dungeon Crusade.\nAnother evil faction that opposes the heroes...The Faith.\nYet another faction in Dungeon Crusade, The Maidens of Witherbrook Forest\nIn the massive land of Avalon, there are 5 different races of creatures and monsters.\nConcept art from Joseph Arnold\nJesse Hansen and his studio will be behind the creation of the heroes and monsters in Dungeon Crusade, and bring to it a unique, retro, yet modern look to the game.\nDungeon Crusade will have an entire art studio, Cornerstone Creative Studios, devoted to bringing the heroes and monsters to life for fellow gamer's and people to enjoy. (this pic is of course a W.I.P. (work in progress)\nThe archer hero being worked on by Jesse at Cornerstone Creative Studios.\n   Shipping charges will be calculated after the campaign ends. At Groovus Games Unlimited, we want backers to pay EXACT shipping and not a penny more. We will be working with the Pledge Manager for this process. Also, we have no way of telling how many stretch goals will be unlocked, and shipping may change based on this factor.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIn pledging to a reward package for Dungeon Crusade, you acknowledge that the final look of the game, materials, game content and rewards are subject to change and will differ substantially from what is being presented within this Kickstarter project. This prototype game within Kickstarter, will be used as a baseline for all of the artists, illustrators and the 3D modeler involved to use their creativity, imagination and talent to create the final retail version of Dungeon Crusade. What you are viewing is the prototype game of Dungeon Crusade. \n\n The prototype game looks very strong already, but the final version will be one of the most visually striking games for a fantasy/dungeon/adventure game that has been seen in recent years. \n\n Other factors, of course, are production delays, shipping delays and customs delays, which are out of our control. However, the company we have partnered with, WinGo games, and our customs broker are very acclimated at handling things such as this, and the process should be smooth. \n\n Lastly, I have put a ship date of Feb 2017, however, I do anticipate a much earlier date for this project to be final and ready to ship. A lot of the hard work has been completed already. Artists do not need to produce concept art. This has been established already within the prototype game. Hardcore playtesting is being conducted to debug the rules, clarify special abilities, line of sight rules, etc. My personal goal is to have this ready for Christmas 2016. Why? Because who wouldn't want Dungeon Crusade under the tree?\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Rodger Deering\n3 created \u00b7 4 backed\nFirst off, welcome everyone to my kickstarter! :) I'm truly glad you're here and for your interest in Dungeon Crusade.

You can find the Groovus Games Unlimited channel here and start watching! >>>> https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyK0dht51J_ERNNi0KwLeGA"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #7", "update_userinfo": "The Return of Dungeon Crusade....", "update_content": "Hello everyone I am very pleased to announce that we have a firm date for the relaunch of Dungeon Crusade; May 22nd!\n\nAs project manager for Dungeon Crusade I had a lot of things I wanted to make sure we had in place to make this a very smooth launch. I made Rodger reshoot brand new videos. They give you some quick overviews on parts of the game. Don\u2019t worry there will still be Rodger sized ones to watch if you have a few hours. ;)  \nRodger also took the scattered rules he had and made a first draft of the rules document. He made an impressive effort to explain the game in great detail and included a lot of pictures and examples. This will be available for everyone to look through. We have an editor now going through it and cleaning it up, but I really look forward to community feedback on it and having you guys help us create a rulebook that is easy to read and clear. If there is one thing I hate personally it is playing a game, hitting an unclear rule, searching the booklet for 10 minutes not finding an answer, then searching the internet, ending up on BoardGameGeek on a thread for the rule during a raging argument for 4 different interpretations. I want these rules to be rock solid, that is very important to me and I have a feeling I am not alone in this.\n\nWe also have a super team of artists, who you will meet on the relaunch who have been hand picked to bring Dungeon Crusade to life. For me a game has to have great mechanics. But even if it has the most innovative mechanics in the world, if you are pushing different colored cubes around a grid, the game is going to lack life. It is important that the art helps place you in the game and gives you a sense of immersion. Our amazing artists have done a spectacular job so far and I need to point out they have not been paid yet. As we have not funded yet, they have not been paid yet.\n\nI also have been trying to get more presence with the YouTube community. This was more difficult than I thought, most of my emails were ignored. The ones who did get back to me, never got back to me a second time. We do have some more things lined up. If you have a Youtuber who you like and want to see them do a feature on Dungeon Crusade please poke them about it and have them contact us. We are a small (like very small, 2 people) start up company and this is our first (of hopefully many) products. Trying to get anyone to give us the time of day has been an exercise in patience.\n\n  Which leads me to my final point before I turn over the mic to Rodger. We need YOU guys, the backers, to help us spread the word. I do have some advertising in place (with the main campaign happening on BoardGameGeek) but we can always use more. Talk about the game, post links, and get the word out. The drums of war have been sounded! Lead our armies forth!\n\nI am confident we will fund, but over funding will unlock a lot of very cool additional content we have planned for the game. Overfunding enough means we can order enough to do a limited print run at the retail level! We never planned to go retail though so we\u2019ll have to see where this takes us.\n\n And without further ado I leave you with the Creator of Dungeon Crusade. See you guys in less than a week!  \n\nDavid Lockwood\n\nHello everyone! :) I hope everyone is doing great! When I launched on kickstarter, people learned fairly quickly it was only me doing EVERYTHING for this game. During that time on kickstarter, a lot of awesome people joined the project, and encouraged I relaunch with some better management in place, and take care of some glaring issues with the project.\n\n  One of the first people who joined me was David Lockwood from Obsidian software. I almost consider him a brother at this point. :) He is such a awesome person. He brought so much focus, structure and help that I badly needed! What I lack in, he truly excels at.\n\nFor the relaunch on kickstarter, he is of course building the page this time around. LOL, I will not be doing a KS page again! Promise! ;) We have worked out many awesome stretch goals, got all of our totals together for the game, and truly helped me seeing things I really didn't see before.\n\nA few more incredible artists have also joined the project. One of the artists in particular had recently worked on a certain game of the year. He saw Dungeon Crusade, and really wanted to be a part of it. Upon relaunch, we are going to reveal who it is. I'm blown away and honored to have him along for the relaunch.\n\nAnother young lady who has joined us has some of her work in the Pathfinder card game. Her art is simply stunning. She also is excited to be a part of Dungeon Crusade.\n\nIn the past month, I have created the Dungeon Crusade rulebook as David mentioned. It is a rough draft, but it looks, and reads great. Lots of diagrams and pictures for explaining the fundamentals of the game. Another person who has joined is a professional editor. He has the rulebook now, and is going over it and cleaning it up. The rulebook will be available for download for everyone to check out when we relaunch on kickstarter\n\nA lot of the artists have submitted a great deal of preview art, and it looks truly stunning. We are going for a retro look of course, and these guys have nailed it perfectly. Think Heroquest, Warhammer Quest and DungeonQuest and you'll get the idea.\n\nThere will be 3 editions of Dungeon Crusade. Base edition, Crusader Edition and Master of the Realm edition. The great news is, all of the editions will be lower priced, and still have all the content that was promised. We are using double sided cardboard miniatures this time around. If you have seen the Legends of Andor's minis, they are on par for what the Dungeon Crusade minis will look like. Plus, it adheres to that retro vibe we are striving for.\n\nSo the bottom line is this, I finally got the help I needed from some incredible people, who share the vision I do on delivering a unique and innovative game to fellow gamers for them to enjoy.\n\nTo be honest, I was on serious overload a few months before launch, and most certainly during launch. I'm so much more at peace now, and relaxed from the help I have received, and it feels GREAT! :)\n\nBut what I would like to share with you tonight is a few of the new videos for the relaunch of Dungeon Crusade. What you will see is the basic setup for Dungeon Crusade, advanced setup (quick version), and advanced setup (long version). Let me explain\u2026\n\nBasic setup is about a 10 minute video. It shows the exact setup procedure you do before every game of Dungeon Crusade.\n\nAdvanced setup will show you the many variables to Dungeon Crusade from scenario to scenario, and how you can create very easy scenarios, to brutally hard scenarios and everything in between. I took the time to make a quick version of advanced setup, and a long version if you really want to learn more about Dungeon Crusade. I tried to film them so they would be enjoyable to watch. Some of the forthcoming videos will be:\n\n\u2022Combat explained with examples.  \n\u2022The patrol route system for the monsters of the dungeon\n \u2022How to win Dungeon Crusade, celebration day and house of chance explained in one single video.\n \u2022A gameplay video comprised of about 4-6 turns to give you guys an idea of the ebb and flow of Dungeon Crusade.  \n\n  I'm using a new format to record with, a static cam and the videos are now much shorter, focused and to the point. They are very briskly paced. Above all, I want fellow gamers and people to feel at ease & comfortable with their pledge. And ask questions! As you have seen, I love to hear from people. The problem is shutting me up once I start talking. ;)  \n\nAlso, we have created our companies You Tube channel \"Groovus Games Unlimited\". We will be uploading all of the new videos there for the relaunch on kickstarter. All of the older legacy videos will of course be available on my personal channel for people to still take a look at.\n\nI hope everyone has a great night and enjoys videos! Hopefully you gain more insight into the world of Dungeon Crusade. THANK YOU to everyone for your interest, time and patience for the relaunch of Dungeon Crusade!

Our Founders believed that Los Angeles actors could form a classical theatre company equal to any in the world. \nToday, our company is comprised of over 180 classically trained and highly accomplished actors - including people you see in film, television, and on Broadway - like these people:\nFrom staging award-winning productions, to housing a Classics Library with 6,500 books, to providing arts education to underserved and incarcerated youth and young adults, to our Academy classes, to developing a tight-knit family of artists and audiences - we offer a lot. Take a look at what we accomplish in just one season:\nOur company members range from faces you know to phenomenal actors that you might not recognize. We are extremely proud to say that every single member of our company has given to their capacity for this campaign. Now, we need to turn to a wider community to ask for help to build our New Home. \n So why should YOU give? \nAs you can see, we do a lot - all in a 49-seat theatre with very, very limited space. So in 2012, we embarked on a comprehensive examination of where we were as a company, where we wanted to be, and what we needed to make our dreams a reality. It was apparent that we had reached a tipping point; in order to continue to grow and take risks artistically, we needed to expand our space physically to better meet the needs of our artists and patrons. After a long search, we found our new home at 110 East Broadway in Glendale, CA: (cue the lights of heaven and angelic singing voices)\nArtist's rendering of the Entrance and the Main Stage of our new home!\nWe don\u2019t agree that it is mad, but there is definitely a method to it. \nUp to this point our Play On! Capital Campaign has raised $1.3 million of the $1.8 million we need to build our new home, BUT there is still more to do!\nThis Kickstarter campaign is a very important portion of what we still need. We have asked Shakespeare (#namedrop) to help explain how it all fits together:\nWe agree, and good question Shakespeare. \nTwo things:\n1.) Space 2.) More space \nIn all seriousness, we are going to be able to expand our mainstage and add a second black box theatre. \nThis is incredibly important for Antaeus. \nIn our current space on many performance nights, we are faced with full houses and long wait lists (yes, we do classical theatre that well!). With the ability to house up to 88 seats, our new mainstage space will provide almost twice as many seats as our current North Hollywood location. A second 45-seat black box space will also allow us to explore smaller works, and offer a lower-priced ticket, which will have the added benefit of increasing accessibility for our patrons.\nIn addition to the added performance space, our new cultural center will provide us with a larger Classics Library - almost double the size of what we currently have now. Our Library is the heart of our company. It has become our gathering place, our classroom, and our core. Members constantly use the space for readings, students find a wealth of texts on our shelves that help them through their studies, and patrons know that they can gather here after any show to meet and share ideas with the actors they have just seen on our stage. \nWe will also be building a proper lobby for our patrons, complete with a small art gallery space. The open floor plan will help us create a richer experience for our guests, and encourage them to come early and spend time viewing our gallery and enjoying the atmosphere, building community even before they enter the house. \nBUT WAIT. There is more. \nIn addition to all the above, our new home will provide us with many essential areas to help our company perform the best work possible, like: \nAn expanded dressing room with enough space to house our regularly large cast productions \nA green room and kitchen area to allow performers a space to prepare and meet \nA prop and construction area that will allow us to better serve the needs of our Production Manager (he is VERY excited about this) and faithful production volunteers\nYes!

I am excited to share my art with you, and I hope that with your support, we can make this deck a reality.\nABOUT RUSSIAN FOLK ART DECK:\nThe original designs of the deck are all inspired by folk designs from Russian heritage and culture. Traditional folk art has always played an intrinsic part of domestic culture across Russia and represents traditions and practices of the citizens.\nRussia has a very long, rich and visual cultural past, from its colorful folk costumes to its ornate religious symbols.\nRussian Folk Art \"Special Edition\" combines flowers, leaves, people, musical instruments and geometric shapes with stylized depictions of birds and animals, as well as mythological creatures.\nDeck Features:\nPrinted at the highest quality by USPCC\nBicycle card stock\nAir - Cushion Finish\n100% Custom Deck\n54 Original Pieces of Art\nGold Foil Tuck Box- stretch goal \nEmbossed Box - stretch goal \nSpecial Limited Edition run of only 2500 decks\nYour support of this Kickstarter campaign will help me cover the costs of setup fees, proof charges, printing and photography. My goal is to create decks that are playable, unique, and valuable.\nI hope that you can support me and help me realize my goal!\nThank you so much! :)\nThe Kremlin is the heart of the Russian political life and the center of it's culture and history. The name Kremlin means \"fortress inside a city\".\nMythological creatures, such as the Siren\u2014a creature of Russian legend that has the face and chest of a woman and the wings and feathered tail of a bird.\nThe balalaika is a plucking string instrument that resembles a guitar, but has a triangular shape and only three strings (or two in some cases). Today the balalaika has disappeared from Russians\u2019 everyday life almost completely. There aren\u2019t many people left who can play it \u2013 not to mention, only professional musicians in Russian folk music ensembles.\nRussian folk dance was and still is an important part of Russian culture. Costumes were beautifully designed with great detail. Typically, the clothing for the dances was based on specific events, such as holidays, and would vary between these events. The color red was incorporated in many of the costumes because it is associated with beauty in the Russian tradition.\n\"Garmoshka\" (or garmon') is a Russian traditional folk button accordion.  Garmoshka is a free-reed wind instrument with bellows and two push-button keyboards. The left keyboard is intended for accompaniment: by pressing a button one makes bass or an entire chord sound. The right keyboard is for playing the melody. Once designed its construction has never been changed.\nAn \"Ushanka\" is a traditional, yet stylish, Russian winter hat with ear flaps, which is extremely warm to handle the frigid Russian winters. It has ear flaps, which can be folded up and tied at the top of the hat, or tied at the chin.\nThe Sun is the most ancient and important symbol of traditional folk art. Russian village people believed the Sun was the reason of life, and of the world as a whole. The very word \"sun\" (solace in Russian) is derived from Sanskrit word \"su\" (\"to create\", \"to give birth\").\nYes, vodka is the most well-known of Russian alcohol. \nYes, most Russians prefer their traditional national vodka than other alcohol (like Mexicans like tequila and Germans love their schnapps). \nYes, a lot of Russians do like vodka BUT not everyone. Many women and some men can\u2019t stand vodka (including myself!) \nYes, Russians drink vodka BUT not every day \u2013 just on occasion (birthday, holiday, wedding, etc.).\n The main motifs of Russian Folk Art are local wild flowers and berries.\nNature has always been a common theme in Russian Folk Art. In Russia people believe that different design elements serve as symbols to protect them from evil forces, to bring wealth, health and love.\nMatryoshka or Russian Nesting Doll is one of the most recognizable symbols of Russian culture. It was invented by a Russian artist more than 100 years ago. These dolls are fit inside one another and they often tell a story about the country's history, culture and customs.\nJacks, Queens and Kings are inspired by Matryoshka or Russian Nesting Doll.\nUncut Sheets:\nThe front side of the Russian Folk Art \"Special Edition\" uncut sheet (frame not included).\n The back side of the Russian Folk Art \"Special Edition\" uncut sheet (frame not included).\nAn uncut sheet of the Russian Folk Art \"Special Edition\" Playing Cards printed by the USPCC\nDimensions: 21 7/8\" X 26 3/8\" \nPackaging: Rolled up and shipped in a cardboard tube\nADD - ONS:\nThese Add-ons can be added to any backer level.\nTo add on a product, keep your pledge level the same, and simply add the amount listed below to your pledge amount.

Nations scramble to upgrade their energy production to keep up with the rapid growth. The price of oil is going up, and nuclear energy is the wave of the future.\nIn Energy Empire, each player takes control of a nation vying for power in the second half of the 20th century. They build up their nation\u2019s industry, commerce, and government by acquiring resources, building structures, and tapping new sources of energy.\nThe major threat in Energy Empire is not war, but uncertain global impacts that affect all nations. Your actions come with a cost. As nations become more industrious, they also increase the amount of pollution in the environment. Careful use of science can reduce the harmful effects of industry, and help avert a global crisis. \nManhattan Project: Energy Empire is a stand alone game in our \"Manhattan Project\" line of games. It shares many of the same mechanics from the original top 150 award winning game, but with less \"take that\" actions. Designed by established game designers Luke Lurie and Tom Jolly.\n1 MAIN GAME BOARD:\n5 PLAYER BOARDS:\nThe MSRP for this game will be $64.99 and it will be released worldwide a month after backers are shipped. We are giving you a $6 discount plus a $13 shipping discount in this campaign. That's roughly a 30% discount overall!\nEnergy Empire uses worker placement, tableau-building, and resource management game mechanics. On each turn, a player can choose to either WORK or GENERATE. On a work turn, a player places a single worker on the main board, then uses workers and energy to activate cards in their tableau. Players may spend energy to use an occupied space on the main board, so no main board spaces are ever completely blocked. On a Generate turn, players get to renew their supply of energy by rolling \u201cenergy dice\u201d that represent nuclear, coal, oil, solar, and other forms of energy.\nDownload the prototype rules draft:\nSome sample cards:\n.\nRahdo Runthrough: Part 1 Gameplay\nA written review by Boardgaming For the Win:\nhttps://boardgamingftw.wordpress.com/2016/03/08/manhattan-project-energy-empire/\n\"I know I love & will continue to play the original but Manhattan Project: Energy Empire has amazed me from every angle.

All these improvements will be found in the retail version as well, except the Missile Crisis promo card.\nIf you wish to purchase some extra stuff from us, simply edit your reward's pledge dollar amount (not the reward level) and add in some extra money to cover the items you wish.\nAfter the campaign, we will be using a pledge manager (a 3rd party tool that will handle order processing after funding). This will allow you to \"spend\" any dollar amount over your chosen reward level on specific items after the campaign is done. Spending more on your Kickstarter reward level will help this campaign reach its funding goal and stretch goals faster. If you prefer, though, you can be charged later for these items, by buying them directly through the pledge manager.\nThe following Add-on Items are available to United States customers only. After the campaign is over, we will work to make these Items available through the pledge manager to a wider range of countries.\nHere are the items offered (all include shipping in the USA):\nWe are paying roughly $13 towards shipping for all backers. That makes USA shipping included, but for other countries, we must charge what USPS charges us (minus a $13 credit). Make sure you only back the reward level for where you want your game shipped.\nThis means no import or VAT charges will be incurred in the EU\nWe have been publishing quality games and accessories for over 5 years and have run over a dozen successful Kickstarter campaigns including the highly rated game The Manhattan Project. Pledge with confidence that we will fulfill your rewards with the highest quality and in a timely manner. It is our goal at Minion Games to help new game designers get published (I blog openly about the process) and our company is setup internally with that goal.

Will your donuts rise to the challenge or get tossed out with the day-olds that failed to sell? Only time will tell. All I know is...it\u2019s a bad day for donuts.\nEach player in the game is a baker.  To win the game, you must gain a baker's dozen (13) points.  Each donut in the game has a point value.  When a donut is eliminated from the game in battle, the baker who eliminated the donut gains its points.\nDuring a player's turn, you draw two (2) donut cards and select one to fry up.  The fried donut is then sent out onto the game board to fight other donuts to the death.  After you've fried the donut, you get a certain number of movements (based off of a dice roll) to maneuver your army of donuts around the game board to setup fights and protect your weaker donuts.\nPAX South 2016 demo game\nOnce all your movements have been made, all donut fights are executed.  After a fight, the losing donut (if it survived) must evacuate the space.  Board positioning and strategy come into play here.

They\u2019ve been in the business for over 13 years and come highly recommended. Their portfolio is endless and includes hit titles like Ticket to Ride, Champions of Midgard, and many others.  \nWe did our research to verify the quality of their products.  We polled both gaming companies that have used them in the past and gamers that own product manufactured in their factory, and everyone responded back with all positive remarks.  \nThey've been very responsive to every question we've asked, and have done so quickly at that.  I have the greatest confidence that they will produce an excellent product for us and do so in a timely manner.\nFunny board games and card games have always been a big part of my life.  I've been playing them with my friends for years and it was only natural that I start developing them as well.  \nAround 8 years ago, I started initial development of two games just as something to do in my spare time.  After a year of playing around with them on index cards, they were shelved.  It wasn't until back in 2013 when I discovered Kickstarter that the idea of actually publishing a game became a reality.  \nThe first game to come down off the shelf was Monkeys Need Love Too.  After months of solid work on the mechanics and getting the illustrations created, we felt we had something worthy, so in 2014 Topwise Games, LLC was formed and we were off.  Monkeys launched on Kickstarter in September 2014 and successfully funded on October 2nd.\nWhile working on the manufacturing of Monkeys at the end of 2014, A Bad Day for Donuts came down off the shelf and was thrust into development.  Game development was slow and steady during most of 2015.  The day job and family time took priority at certain points of the year, but over the course of 2015 the game was further developed, modified (heavily), modified again, and again, illustrations ordered, more modifications, until finally everything snapped together into what we have today.\nJust as in Monkeys, with A Bad Day for Donuts, one of the goals was to have the illustrations bring out the humor of the cards and game board.  I employed Rick Menard once more, and once more he did not disappoint.\nSo once again our promise to you is that the game is fully ready for manufacturing as soon as the Kickstarter funds.  We will still be play-testing the heck out of the game while the Kickstarter runs to make sure we didn't miss any typos, errors, or faults in the game mechanics or flow, but just as with Monkeys, when Kickstarter releases the funds, the manufacturer will immediately be given the green light to start the process.\nNone of that however will happen without your help.

This will be on a first come, first served basis.\nWe will be sending out a survey to these creative backers where you can tell us the top two or three characters you'd like to nickname, along with the nickname and some flavor text. We'll name your character according to your priority and the availability of cards.

Welcome to the Ole' West!\nProspectors are flockin' out here to try to make they's riches, hopin' to strike gold. But us, we got a better idea don't we? That's right! Regardless of who finds the gold, everyone is gonna need a place to stay, play, and drink. So let's build the best gald darn Saloon that's ever been built! \nSaloon Tycoon is a 2-4 player tile laying game that plays in about 40-60 minutes and is unlike any other game you've played before! Not only can you place tiles side by side, but you can also place them on TOP of each other! Simple enough for casual gamers, but deep enough for experienced gamers... come on and let's get buildin'! \nIn Saloon Tycoon players take turns taking one action on their turn. Most turns are fast and there isn't much down time between turns. First, you earn your income in gold based on the number of tiles in your Saloon. Then you will take an action. You may buy and build a tile by placing it on your board. Or maybe you will play a Tycoon Card to get some gold or give you more actions. \nOver 50 room tiles with 18 unique designs!\nEach turn you have the opportunity to buy supply cubes to place on your tiles. Once you have fully supplied a tile it is considered to be complete and you get that tile's bonus! Even though you normally only get one action, through card play and tile bonuses, you could accomplish an awful lot in one turn. \nEach player will have some secret objectives, called Secret Claims, they are trying to accomplish. There are also common objectives available to everyone, called Open Claims. These objectives will require completing certain tiles and/or attracting certain characters to your Saloon. \nThere are many Claim cards and only some will be in play each game\nCharacters you say? That's right! There are some influential Citizens in town as well as some unsavory Outlaws. Build and complete special tiles to attract the Citizens for additional points, but beware the Outlaws... they can make your life as a Saloon owner more difficult. \nThere are 6 male and 6 female characters in total\nBuild tiles, attract Citizens, and complete Objectives to earn the most Reputation Points and win the game! \nInterested in reading the full rules? Click Here! (Note! There will be graphic examples added and there may be a few minor changes) \nNOTE! Final components are subject to change. \nAnd if you pledge for the Deeeeeluxe Version you'll also get... \nEnough real, and I mean REAL (fool's) GOLD to replace those boring old cardboard gold nuggets. Amaze your friends with the shiny stuff and then use it to build the best Saloon this side of the Rockies. Comes with a drawstring burlap sack to hold them goodies in as well. Then there are two boards for holding all that gold and the supply cubes during play. All of these are Kickstarter Exclusives*, so get 'em while the gettin' is good! \n*NOTE! Kickstarter Exclusives in this project are defined as exclusive in that they will never be available in retail, but we reserve the right to sell or offer them directly or through promotional outlets such as the BGG store or at game conventions. Please be aware that there is no guarantee of reprinting these items and that the only way to guarantee you get them is to back this campaign. \nFollow along with Doug as he learns to play Saloon Tycoon!\nPart 1 \nPart 2\nKen Grazier from Geek-Craft took the game for a spin.

Be sure to keep reading and check out our HUBS Concept below to see how you could receive up to a 100% refund on shipping! Here is the breakdown of shipping costs for each pledge level by country. \nIf you follow our projects, you are aware that we try something new each time. In the past, we have done things like Loyalty Rewards, Instant Rewards, and we have even shipped games BEFORE the Kickstarter project was even over! \nFor this Kickstarter, we want to introduce to you the concept of HUBS. HUBS is meant to attack the problem of shipping costs for as many backers as is possible and are willing. First and foremost, we want to make sure that everyone understands that you should back this project with the expectation that you will pay the full shipping cost. There is no guarantee of discounted shipping and we reserve the right to abandon/discontinue the HUBS process for any reason. Having said that, there should be an opportunity for some of you to get back some or even all of your shipping cost. ALSO, THERE IS NO OBLIGATION! If you want your game shipped directly to you, that is what we will do! \nHere is how it works: Once we have everyone\u2019s shipping addresses we will perform a zip code level analysis to determine how many backers are in a particular area. For everyone in a zone that showed interest in participating (via post project survey), you will get an email or message indicating how much money you will be reimbursed, and asking you to confirm participation OR deny and have the game shipped directly to you. \nHUBS example\nFor example, let\u2019s say having performed the analysis we found there are 22 backers in and around the 77062 zip code in Houston, Texas. Only 18 were interested in participating in HUBS, so we calculate the shipping cost to ship those 18 to the BASE HUB and compare it to the cost it would ship to everyone individually. Then we factor in our own fees and expenses. We then divide the remainder of the shipping evenly among the 18 participants and return an equal amount (up to the cost of shipping) to each! In this example, we would expect it would be a very high % refund of shipping if not the full amount. \nThe map below is a real world view of backers in one of our previous campaigns. You can see that there are several areas in this portion of the northeast of backers within a few miles of each other. If they are all willing to meet at a designated Base HUB to get their game the shipping cost is minimized! And we want to return that savings to YOU! \nCircles are 18 miles in Diameter\nWhen the campaign is over there will be a survey sent to you. If you have backed projects before, you know how this works. You will give your address and some other details in the survey. We will ask you a few important questions in the survey regarding HUBS and if you would like to participate. \nWhat are the benefits? You save money and the project saves money. You don\u2019t have to do any work coordinating a group buy, but can benefit if there are others in your area backing the game! \nWhat is the catch? There isn\u2019t one really, other than you will have to coordinate with your BASE HUB and go pick up your game locally, but you know that up front and if that isn\u2019t something that seems worth it you simply opt out and we will ship yours directly to you. Everything else is handled for you, refunds of shipping can be done through KS and we do all the analysis work. \nWhat are the risks? Well the biggest is not getting enough participation or you are in an area where there just simply were not any other backers. If we don\u2019t have participation, there is no HUBS. Also this includes having at least one volunteer to be the BASE HUB in an eligible area with multiple backers. All of these are reasons why we advise everyone to ASSUME YOU ARE PAYING FULL SHIPPING and any possible refund is simply a bonus. \nWill VRG still offer Group Buys? Yes! Especially for international it is probably unlikely there will be enough volume in most areas for the HUBS concept to yield benefit (however even just a few in the same area could save you a decent amount). We still encourage taking advantage of the multiple copies level to guarantee a reduction in cost per game. \nAs with all of our campaigns, we stand behind our products 100% and if you are unhappy with the game, you may return it for a refund up to 30 days after receiving it.

Please make sure to follow our progress in the updates. \nVillages of Valeria is a village-building card game in which players establish resources, construct buildings, and attract adventurers to become the next capital city of Valeria. Take on the role of a Duke in the vast and beautiful kingdom of Valeria and, on your turn, lead the table by selecting an Action - Harvest, Develop, Build, Recruit, or Tax - for everyone to perform while you get a slight advantage for being the Active Player.\nVillages of Valeria is a stand alone game set in the world of Valeria and takes place just before the hordes of monsters invade the kingdom in Valeria: Card Kingdoms. \nUpdated Once Per Day - ~6000 Deluxe Copies Pledged and climbing!\nIn Villages of Valeria, 1 to 5 players compete to build the best village in the kingdom in about 45-60 minutes.\nCard Anatomy\nThere are two main cards in Villages of Valeria: Building cards and Adventurer cards. \nSurprising strategic decisions with just 2 types of cards!\nBuilding Cards can be used in two different ways: \nYou can pay the Resources listed on the left to build the Building and use its power during the game. \nYou can Develop it as a Resource by flipping it upside down and placing it under your Castle. \nAdventurer cards are attracted to your village by certain Building types listed on the left of the card. Pay Gold to add them to your village to use their power or reap Victory Points at the end of the game. \nGame Flow\nThe game is played over several rounds where players take turns being the Active Player. The Active Player chooses an Action and, in turn order, all other players may follow and do the same Action but at a slight disadvantage.  \nActions\nHARVEST: Draw 3 Cards. \n   Follow: Draw 1 Card. \nDEVELOP: Discard 1 card to add a Card to your Castle as a Resource.\n   Follow: You may discard 2 cards to add a Card to your Castle as a Resource. \nBUILD: Place Gold on Resources to add a building to your village and draw 1 card.\n   Follow: You may place Gold on Resources to add a building to your village. \nRECRUIT: Pay 1 Gold to add an Adventurer to your village.    Follow: Pay 2 Gold to add an Adventurer to your village. \nTAX: Collect 1 Gold and draw 1 Card.\n   Follow: None.\nVictory!\nThe game ends after the turn in which any player's Village contains the target number of Buildings and/or Adventurers. This can happen either because the Active Player has built a Building or recruited an Adventurer, or because another player following the action has done so. The entire Action is played out, so even if the Active Player has triggered the end of the game, all other players still get a chance to follow the Action and add to their own Villages.\nCount up your Victory Points and see who's village will become the next capital city of Valeria!\nWatch the play through video by Rahdo Runs Through: \nUpdated with Unlocked Stretch Goals.\n Game Contents \n72 Building Cards \n10 Adventurer Cards \n5 Castle Cards \n5 Player Reference Cards \n30 Screen Printed Wood Gold Coins\n1 Screen Printed Wood Active Player Token \n1 Rulebook \n1 Beautifully Illustrated Box \nAdded to Game via Stretch Goals Thanks to Our Backers\n1 Cleric Adventurer Card\n1 Warlord Adventurer Card\n1 Blacksmith Adventurer Card\n1 Rogue Adventurer Card\n1 Summoner Adventurer Card\n1 Necromancer Adventurer Card\n3 Fountain Building Cards\n3 Tannery Building Cards\n3 Forger's Den Building Cards\n3 Archery Range Building Cards\n1 Solo Variant Reference Card\n1 Action-Selection Card\nAll card will be 320gsm Blackcore stock with a Linen Finish thanks to our backers!

We believe we have a great game here and want to bring it to tables all over the world. Every dollar we make will go directly back in to making Villages of Valeria a better game.

We realize that the publication of a board game can be complicated and, no matter how experienced the project creators and mangers are, some problems may occur. In an effort to reduce the likelihood of delays and mistakes, we have taken several steps to prepare for success:\n\n1. This game project, as well as the Kickstarter campaign itself, are in the hands of two well-seasoned professionals. David MacKenzie has been running Kickstarter projects since 2010 (Alien Frontiers, Sunrise City, Swinging Jivecat Voodoo Lounge, Valeria: Card Kingdoms, ManaSurge), and Isaias Vallejo comes from a digital game background as production and studio director at Big Fish Games and has designed two successful board games: Sunrise City and Valeria: Card Kingdoms.\n\n2. We are dedicated to backer communication and feedback. Throughout the campaign, we will be as transparent about the process and as open to feedback as possible without jeopardizing production and delivery timelines.\n\n3. We have done significant pre-production. All the art and graphic design for Villages of Valeria is completed with the exception of stretch goal content. The art and design for the stretch goal content has been sketched out and is ready to push forward as soon as each goal is achieved.\n\n4. We have our manufacturer lined up and ready to begin the pre-press process as soon as the campaign ends.\n\nWe hope that everything goes as planned, but if something falls through the cracks, we are ready and willing to employ every tool at our disposal to get the project back on track and running smoothly.\n\nThank you for your support!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #61", "update_userinfo": "Shadow Kingdoms of Valeria", "update_content": "Greetings Valerians...\nWe want to let you know about our next Valeria-themed game, but if you no longer want to receive update emails from this project, you can turn off this project's notifications through your Settings // Notifications // Projects You've Backed controls.

In Corrupted Kingdoms, you play one of six monstrous Corporations vying for control of the realm\u2019s noble government. \nMuster your Minions of goblins, golems, devils, and zombies. Send them to pressure leaders, control votes, and pass corrupt Bills full of special interest favors. And be rewarded with decadent Guilty Pleasures!\nBut be on guard - other players are working with similar groups and are just as motivated to promote their own nefarious agendas. Only the most successful corporation will rule the realm!\nCorrupted Kingdoms was designed by Raymond Chandler III and Dirk Knemeyer over several years and has been through through hundreds of play tests. We\u2019ve outlined the project here on Kickstarter and we're sure that you\u2019ll enjoy the game. If you\u2019re the type of voter who prefers even more information, feel free to also check out our Print-and-Play files for a more detailed look at the Corrupted Kingdoms rules and its components.\nScrappy Preview gives a drawn overview of the game:\nIn Corrupted Kingdoms, two to six players compete to score points by passing bills and collecting opulent rewards. Each turn, players take two actions, selecting from among the three available actions in the game:\nSelect a special interest Favor from the market. Decide whether to take its Minions from the special interest or add that Favor to a Bill.\nSend your Minions to influence and take control of a Leader. If another player already controls that leader, well, politics can be messy!\nCall for a vote on a Bill in any kingdom where you control a leader. Lobby your competitors, cajole, threaten, and cut deals to pass your Bill! If you don't buy the vote, someone else will!\nReap your reward and enjoy decadent Guilty Pleasures for successfully passing your Bills. After all, who wouldn't love a Giant Panda Cloak this winter?\nThroughout the game, use the special abilities of your particular company's Chaos Cards to pursue your nefarious goals and thwart your opponents!\nThe player who most successfully pursues their corporate and special interest agenda wins and rules the realm!

Copies will then be sent to our fulfillment partner depots in various regions around the world for ultimate distribution to backers. This saves you on shipping and extra taxes.\nWe're also offering a $10 shipping discount to our Kickstarter backers for individual pledge levels which makes shipping 100% free to the United States and relatively less expensive elsewhere.\nWe recognize that even with these discounts, shipping to many parts of the world is just plain expensive. We can't change this, but we can try to make it easier for our backers in these areas to join the project and receive their rewards. To this end, we've created Base Bundle and Deluxe Bundle pledge levels each containing three copies of the Base Game or Deluxe Edition respectively that will fulfill as one shipment. Because the three copies are shipped together in one box, shipping in this manner is less expensive than backing three individual copies of the game separately. So feel free to join with your friends, meet your neighbors, and collaborate in your communities to get your copies, and we'll make sure you get them.\nGiven our strategy of shipping to regional fulfillment depots, various countries will receive their copies at different times. Historically, backers in Asia and the Pacific receive their copies soonest since they are nearest to our manufacturer, then the U.S. and western Europe are relatively close together, and finally backers in the rest of the world receive theirs. We anticipate that all backers will receive their copies by September 2016, but most of you will receive your copies sooner. We'll keep you posted with more details via regular updates as we move forward into production and fulfillment.\nFinally, we also plan to offer Gen Con pickup for backers. The summer con season is very important for us. Once the games arrive in the United States, we'll commence fulfillment for U.S. backers and also begin to sell at conventions. We realize that this may occur before some backers, particularly those in more remote locales, have received their games and we're offering Gen Con pickup to give people more fulfillment options as a result. We'll provide more details about this via updates closer to Gen Con. We hope you understand and still chose to support our project!\nArtana is committed to supporting our retail partners. We\u2019re offering wholesale pricing to verified stores and other gaming establishments. We treat you like other backers, but you will receive your rewards ahead of other normal distributions channels. If you are a verifiable retailer, please contact us through Kickstarter or send an email to hello@artana.com for more information about how to pledge at this level.  \n(Co-Designer) Raymond Chandler III grew up on family tabletop games.

We've tested it, retested it, given it love, and are ready to send the game to print as soon as the campaign is over.

Since then, they have been working on two new releases, one being The Opulent, and another called Nawakwa.  They are a two-person team with the ability to design games all the way from the mechanics, to the graphic design / illustration.  They also created their own website, all the videos, and even their mobile convention booth and signage made out of wood (photo below).

In Suit Up, players are competing professionals trying to collect the best group of sheep... err, friends, to prove which of them is the best in the group. You'll need to plan your moves wisely to gather the most useful influence and pluck the best of the bargain bin friends that you can. \nAn example 2 player game\nSuit Up is for those times when:\nYou want a 90 minute game in 45 minutes.\nChoices must matter, but not overwhelm.\nGoals must be clear, but strategies flexible.\nA big box game must fit in a small box space.\nYou want to play a competitive worker placement game, without the work. \nIn the game, you have two main options on your turn - move to gather influence and favor (special ability cards) or spend the influence you've gained to make a new friend.These friends not only give you the score you need to win, but also help you gain more influence - and, perhaps, meet the end game scoring conditions.\nUsing a unique blend of tried and tested mechanics, the game creates a natural narrative arc. This makes each stage of the game feel distinct. Every design decision was made to create a calm, engaging yet speedy game. Best of all, its compact size makes it the ultimate travel game - easy to pick up and play and still provide the feel of a big box game. \nIf you enjoy games like Lords of Waterdeep, Istanbul, and Stone Age, but wanted something quicker and smaller then Suit Up will fit right into your collection. Your support is vital to help me get this game to the people that will love and enjoy it.\nWhy back now? \nGreat price point!\nSuit Up will have a higher MSRP later ($39) - backing now saves you money.\nLimited distribution\nThe planned print-run is very small (1,000 copies) and the game will be hard to find later.\nFun!\nI want to make this project as fun and enjoyable an experience for you as Suit Up is - from Day One. Being a part of the community behind this game will be a once in a lifetime opportunity.\nFriends.\nThis will be an excellent chance to meet new people and make friends - some near and some far. All from the safety of your own home.\nPolls.\nParticipate in the polls. There will be several chances for backers to determine the direction that Suit Up goes - your voice will leave a lasting imprint on the game.\n Suit Up is all about friendship - and what better way to show that than by making unlikely mechanics not only friends, but the best of friends. It all began with a thought - what would happen if we mixed Worker Placement mechanics with a Rondel? And so Suit Up was born. \nIn Suit Up you have one worker that represents you. The limited range of movement and the constant obstacle of your opponents creates a shifting landscape for you to master.\nWith separate player boards to keep track of your resources, a minimal amount of game upkeep, and a manageable game space, the game has been designed to keep your focus on the fun stuff - meaningful decisions.\n\nAnd the meaningful decisions are plentiful. What end-game bonuses will you try to achieve? What person will be your next friend? What is the best way to collect and spend your resources? When should you use your Favors to manipulate the game and how?  \nFinally, there is always the element of surprise. A good player can turn a losing position into a winning one with the right amount of cunning - even on the very last play. But no matter the goal, you'll always look down at the group of friends you made and feel like you built something.  \nLink to Rulebook & How to Play Video\nIf you're wondering how much game can fit inside a box that's no bigger than 3 Blu-ray cases, the answer is: this much game! Oh, I guess you can't see me holding my arms apart. Well, the graphic below should answer your question. All of this goodness fits inside a travel-sized 2-piece box (8.3\" x 5.1\".x 1.4\")  \nLink to Component List & Quality\nYou don't need to take my word for how great a game this is. Here are some links to previews of the game and what others have said. And if you won't trust those, you can always try it out online using our link below.\nMaurice Fitzgerald at Club Fantasci:\nI was amazed at how compact the game was without skimping on anything.\nTaylor Anderson at Bearded Meeple:\nI enjoyed the game. I hope you get the chance to check it out!\nLink to Digital Files\nProducing a board game isn't cheap or easy. For this reason, I've spent years designing and perfecting Suit Up and this project. I've been making sure that every dollar is backing value and producing the best possible game. I can't do this alone - I need your help. Every dollar you pledge not only helps to make this game into a reality, but goes towards producing a higher quality game that will not only feel better to play, but that can last the rigors of repeated use.\n\nOnce we've reached our funding goal, I have a handful of stretch goals that I've planned for. Your input for what you want improved is critical. For this reason, it's important for you to pledge early, so you have a say in what stretch goals we aim for first.\nNew challengers await\nI would love to be able to add in the two extra playable characters - so that will be the first goal. Beyond that, the voice of my backers matter most to me. \nLink to Pledge Levels\nWhile I have been the driving force behind making Suit Up a reality, there have been dozens that have helped along the way. I am grateful for them.  \nMy goal is to give back to the community that has given me great friends and joy. I, like you, am a gamer at heart. I love to sit at a table and enjoy time with friends over a board game.\n\nI have helped many before, by welcoming them to groups, teaching new games, giving advice on projects and game designs, attending weekly designer meetings, etc. I will continue to do so in the future. Perhaps I met you this way - and, if I haven't, I hope that someday I will.\nSuit Up at the Dallas Games Marathon!\nClick here to find out about the Dallas Games Marathon - a place where many friends are made. \nFor Suit Up, I'm self-publishing because I want first hand experience of how to make a game, from start to finish.

Creating a physical product to ship to all of my new friends and backers means that I have to deal with manufacturers, distributors, shipping companies, etc. \n\nI have made alternate plans should any problems arise. Also, I have been following similar projects since early 2013, noting all their issues and how they've resolved them. I have worked alongside several other designers and publishers that have produced games of their own. Many of them I've met through the Dallas Designer Group (which I've attended regularly for over two years), but also several that I've met in conventions or through their KS projects. I'm confident that should any issues arise (which they often do) I am in a position to deal with them. I am also able to find the right support should I need it.\n\nI believe in the importance of communication, so should any issue arise, I will let you know.

I've been making games since I was 10 and have been making them professionally for over 20 years. I've even taught game design for the past ten years and I can't think of any better way to share my creativity and bring a smile to the world than through games. Recently, I decided to found Dice Made Me Do It! and begin making fast playing, custom dice and card games. I guess you can say the fever took with a vengeance, which resulted in this Kickstarter.

Rest assured we stand behind our games and gameplay and foresee no issues.\n\nWhile three of our games are art complete, After Days requires a few additional pieces as do our stretch goal cards. We've scheduled ample time and have numerous exceptional artists lined up to provided these, but as with anything scheduled in the future there are always risks. Fortunately, our artists are known commodities and we know what to expect so we do not foresee anything major.\n\nManufacturing is always a potential issue and as Dice Made Me Do It! has not used this manufacturer before, a number of other companies our size have and they highly recommend our manufacturer.

Additionally, players work to discredit the insane conspiracies of other players (what nut jobs!) by leaking stories to the tabloid press. Points are scored for the conspiracies left at the end of the round and those that are accepted as possibly true by the public double in value. The game ends when a player crosses one hundred points. The highest score wins.\n\nIf you would dare to read the rulebook for Conspiracy! it is available for download HERE. We promise such downloads are not tracked by the Reptilian overlords.

Aside from mastering the unique combo-creating gameplay of your own champions, figuring out how to outmaneuver your opponent is where the true challenge lies.\nEach player has the same hand of ten champions and will simultaneously play them as they fight over key locations throughout the world of Aerim, each worth varying victory points. Each champion has two abilities: a battle ability that's triggered during battles and a legacy ability that can be used only while on top of the legacy (discard) pile. This creates an intricate latticework of strategy for the players as each champion must be considered for not only what he can do in the current battle, but also for which ability he will add to the next.\nFurther impacting the critical decisions within the game is the Fatestone tie-breaking system. The Fatestone starts at a value of one, and whoever holds the Fatestone die loses all ties; that player may instead pass the stone to his opponent to claim a victory in that tie, but doing so raises the value of the Fatestone by one each time it is passed. At the end of the game, the player holding the Fatestone adds its final value to his victory point tally. Whichever player has the most victory points at the end of the game wins!\nWant to learn more about Shadows & Steam? Or the differences between the sets?

We successfully launched our first Kickstarter for our chaotic, casual card game IncrediBrawl, followed by Strife: Legacy of the Eternals which delivered last Spring.\nV3G is excited to bring you the second strategy game in our line-up, Strife: Shadows & Steam, by Christopher Hamm, for the low price of only $15! The MSRP on this game (without including any stretch goals we may unlock) will be at least $19.99 - so you're getting the game at a wholesale rate ($11) + shipping!\nThis Kickstarter is proudly Exclusive-Free. Our commitment to our backers is to deliver a world-class gaming experience, and to use each stretch goal to increase both the quality and value of this game for gamers everywhere.\nThe better we do, the better the game, the better the value of your pledge. It\u2019s that simple.\nV3G is also thankful that Chris Hamm, our game designer, and Claudio Pilia, our illustrator, have entrusted us with their amazing visions that have helped shaped Strife: S&S into what you see today. Learn more about these amazing guys below!\nChristopher Hamm is a board-game designer from Indianapolis, IN. He\u2019s a lifelong lover of all manner of games, including RPGs, MTG, Poker, as well as classic and modern board games. This is Chris' second published game, and he's got more designs and games in the works. Chris is also an avid blogger and game reviewer at his site lifeingames.com.\nFreelance illustrator & concept artist Claudio Pilia finished his art education in 2014 in Berlin, where he enhanced his knowledge of drawing and painting. His digital art skills are completely self taught and with the combination of both he is currently travelling around the world to continue his learning process and evolve a unique design language. Currently he is working on different independent projects, helping to visualize ideas and create worlds and he is always happy to get involved in new and exciting opportunities.

Our first game, IncrediBrawl, was delivered early and on-budget, as well as our second game with Strife: Legacy of the Eternals. We\u2019re confident we can achieve the same success with Strife: Shadows & Steam.\n\nStrife is completely designed and illustrated, except for any stretch goal rewards that may be earned during the course of this Kickstarter. The biggest risk we have is in finishing stretch-goal related artwork in order to stay on our timeline, but every allowance will be made to speed up this portion, should the situation arise.\n\nOur printer is selected, and ready to begin, as soon as we can get them the files. We have several options for fulfillment and distribution lined up as well, based on the success level of this campaign.\n\nBarring any unforeseen circumstances (production delays, customs, acts of God), our goal is to bring Strife to you as quickly as possible. This is currently scheduled for July of 2016, but every effort will be made to speed that up if possible. \n\nOur intention is to have this available to the public at Gen Con 2016, which means our goal is to have all backers shipped by then.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "Check out Chris' latest game - Legendary Creatures!", "update_content": "When Chris Hamm, the designer of Strife and a close friend, told me he had been contacted to design a new game over a year ago I was really excited for him.

In A.D.A.P.T. I've created for you somewhat of a mash-up style fighting game that combines those two loves.\nA.D.A.P.T. is a mid-to-light weight card and dice game that...\nhas mighty new Leveling, Drafting, and Mash-up game mechanisms.\nimplements ocean-deep strategies via tons of abilities and body part combinations that are as fun to build as they are exciting to use.\nis designed to use full sets of polyhedral dice that directly support the above leveling mechanisms and strategies (21 unique Halfsies Dice included).\nAbout A.D.A.P.T. (updated)\nA.D.A.P.T. is a mashup style battle game with a unique new experience-based drafting mechanism where each player starts as a humble guppy fish and then upgrades his body over time, while forcibly Adapting new parts, to create a Frankenstein-level \"Masterfish\", all in preparation for battle to be come the last Masterfish in the sea. \nAlternately stated: It's a unique, clever, fast-playing game about mutant fish battling to the death. : )\nIn A.D.A.P.T. all players share one deck, and every single card in the deck is unique; unique art and unique stats! That means that whatever you buy I can't, and whatever I buy you can't.  As a result you'll not only Adapt your fish, but you'll also have to Adapt your strategy.\nA.D.A.P.T. plays in 30 minutes, and is designed for 2-3 players ages 13+, but can adapt to meet the needs of larger gaming groups (up to 6), as well as younger players (ages 7+).  Between A.D.A.P.T.'s in-game rules for playing with kids ages 7+, and the fact that all fish in the core game are real animals with stats and abilities based on those real animals, A.D.A.P.T. can serve as a reliable learning game for play with the younger crowd, while remaining, at it's core, meaty enough for the adults it is designed for.\nTo learn more about how the game plays, see our \"How it plays\" section below.

Designed as a living crystal fish...\nInitial concept sketches.\nThey'll adapt a lot from here, but here's a peek.\n Final art for Diamondsoul.\nDiamondsoul Guppy\n$38,000 SG - UNLOCKED!\nThe $38,000 Stretch Goal bulks up the value of your Bonus Packs even more by introducing 6 extra Status Tracker Cards across the R, G, and B Packs!

The new design will display the custom layout for playing with kids, as well as have a cheat-sheet of the basic rules of the game when gaming with your guppies!\nAdditionally the section of the manual dedicated to these rules will be expanded and upgraded as well.\nThe Final Stretch Goal Voting Area\nI hereby present to you two phenomenal upgrade options for the game box! Vote now, then go share the campaign to help us get there!\nOption #1!\n\"3d Lenticular Printing\" for the cover of the box!  As the box moves 3d fish will swarm in to form the final box cover image we all know and love!  Take a look!\nRender only, actual art will have a deep 3d appearance!  Final design will have splashy water, forming clouds, and may even have the fish leaping from the water!  To see the power of the potential motion and 3d effects, take a look at the video clip here (30s - sorry for the crazy music, I didn't make the video : ).\nOption #2!\nThe box is upgraded to a \"Hinge and Magnet\" style 1-piece box that closes with the power of the Magnetfish! Take a look!\nInstead of the image moving, the lid will!  Final design subject to change.  Magnet fish do not really exist (though it would be cool).\nThere can be only one Mastergoal in the sea!\nVOTE HERE!\nVoting will run until the moment that final Stretch Goal is unlocked!\nWant to find out all the glorious details?

A.D.A.P.T. is one of them:\nBearded Meeple accepted a rare late request to review A.D.A.P.T. and blew this 4 MINUTE overview/review video out of the water!\nUndead Viking did his initial review using the B&W print & play version. I sent him a color prototype to take a look at, and he liked the art so much he shot a 2nd video (7mins).\nA.D.A.P.T. still has even more reviews coming!  \nA few press comments...\nA.D.A.P.T. includes 60+ unique cards, 3 player mats, and 3 sets of custom dice.\n...and every card in the box is unique, which results in very interesting gameplay since we all share one deck! \nPlus, with Stretch Goals the contents of the game have increased even further!\nBy popular demand, a closeup of the Maincore game's dice.\nGame Stats:\nAges \"7+\" listed due to in game rule mods, though primarily designed for 13+.\nFor 2-3 players, plays in 30 minutes, and designed for ages 13+.\n(Plays well with ages 7+. Certain Stretch Goals will further aid playing with the young ones.)\nFREE COMPANION APP! - Install it right now!\nAlso we're offering a Companion App that is both a general Dice Roller, and a Statistic Tracker.  Though it's not required for play, it sure can be helpful to have!  Best of all, it's totally free!  Enjoy!\nTo play with up to 6 players, order two copies or take a look at the Bonus Packs below.

Save even more if you're an aspiring Masterfish or Angelfish.\nThe Money Back Guarantee (love it or ship it back within 2 weeks for a full refund).\nWe simply can't afford to do this without you.  You are helping make a dream come true, a mom 'stay-at-home' (yes, she very much wants to : ), and an amazing game to be made that you'll get to play before anyone else.\nThank you in advance for your pledge!\nIntroducing our new UFRST Shipping (Universal Flat Rate Shipping Technique).  Shipping has never been so simple.\nIn short: Free to the USA and $7 flat rate to everywhere else. Live in the EU? In Australia? In Brazil? ...all $7.  Even if you add everything to your pledge.  Take a look...\nHere's a visual of the shipping prices....\nFlat Rate Worldwide Shipping. That means: The same price everywhere outside the USA, no matter where you live, or how much you add to your pledge.\nWe gladly also offer Friendly Worldwide Shipping through our relationships with worldwide shipping agencies.  That means you don't have to pay VAT on the import of the game, we do it for you.\nHow are we able to do this? Shipping to the USA from the USA is inexpensive and is covered by the shipping subsidy built into the base pledge.  We then priced out how much extra it costs to ship to EU backers (the biggest slice of the pie outside the USA), and then we're covering the extra costs to everywhere else.  It's as simple as that! Our way of thanking everyone for being a part of this.\nTimelines are estimates based on quotes from manufacturing companies and previous experience. We promise to do our best to stay on top of, or ahead of, the timeline.\nGate Keeper Games is a family run game design and publishing company.  It's largely a one-man-show, but without my Beautiful Wife and Amazing Children I would not be able to do what I have with this company.\nWe as a family are committed to treating you like you're one of us.  That means we look out for you, we're honest with you, and we still love you even when you share \"constructive criticism\". ; )\nWe as a business take hard work seriously, believe in keeping promises, and don't believe in budgeting in profit into the Funding Goal.  If we make any 'take home' on this, which a hard worker has the right to do, it will be well into the Stretch Goals and/or after the campaign in retail.  It's not the best business model, but we're a family first!\nMe as me: I believe so strongly in this game I've invested $12,796 myself into the production, art, and shipping of the game (allowing us to fund that much sooner!). We authentically get to do this together! : )\nAll in all: Count on being respected and treated like you're cared about, because you are.

Demand waned and underground fight clubs quickly became popular and began producing huge dividends. Larger and larger dinosaurs were pitted against each other until today we have Ultimate Dinosaur Fighting.\nStep into a world where you control these ancient beasts where every movement and action could be their last. The game is easy to learn, fast paced, quick to setup, has a high replay value and is just great fun.\nYou can play as a one off battle or run a stable of dinosaurs using the campaign rules.

Every package WILL have the final postage fee printed on the label for verification. A tracking number will be provided when the reward ships. Estimated shipping costs are exactly that- estimates. The final weight of product is undetermined but most rewards are expected to weigh less than 4 lbs.\nUnited States\nRewards for US supporters will be shipped via the least expensive parcel shipping available. The expected shipping for the majority of orders are described below: All Box-sets fit in USPS Medium Flat Rate Shipping Boxes (est. $12). Shipping on all US orders will not exceed the USPS Medium Flat-Rate box rate. In other words, pledge your heart out, we\u2019ll make up the difference.\nInternational\nInternational orders will be invoiced at actual postage cost. International postage requires customs forms. We are required by law to disclose the pledge amount on these forms. If you are unsure how expensive international shipping can be, please ask us for an estimate.\n\"This game fits 2-6 players and games with more players tend to go more quickly (as 6 raging and upgraded dinosaurs can cause a LOT of damage).

We have done the research, we have spent time and spoken to other Kickstarter project owners and learned something from each that turned out useful in the planning and execution of the Ultimate Dinosaur Fighting Kickstarter.\n\nOutside of Kickstarter I have professional experience managing multi-million dollar projects with tight resources and tighter schedules. I've written 2 books on gaming, and published a bi-monthly game magazine for almost 2 years. If you want more details, check my full bio or feel free to send me a message and ask.\n\nHow can you guarantee my pledge reward?\n\n In truth we can't. We did the next best thing by alleviating much of the risk of being a backer. \n\nHow? \n\nSimply by paying for everything possible upfront so that no unexpected costs can get into the way of your positive experience with Dark Cult Games.\n\nWhat are the risks?\n\nIn Kickstarter the risk to the backer is in not receiving all of the reward that matched their pledge level. For Ultimate Dinosaur Fighting we have done everything in our power to minimize these risks for everyone in advance. Much of the artwork is done, The sculptors have already started, and we have assurances from all of our suppliers that they can deliver on time. \n\nWhat about the endless delays experienced by some other projects? Delays on things we do not, and cannot, directly control are an unfortunate possibility. But we will do everything in our power to make things right for you the backer. \n\nWe are glad you are taking a look at our project and hope you become one of our backers.\n\nThank you from the Dark Cult Games team.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #45", "update_userinfo": "Dinosaur Fighting: 2nd Ed + Expansion", "update_content": "We wanted to let you know that we have an expansion out for Ultimate Dinosaur Fighting. \nWhile 2nd edition has an upgrade to art, a couple minor rule changes, it includes a Victory Point track instead of VP chits. \nThe biggest edition is the Expansion: Triassic Terror.

The saga is told through the eyes of Jarra, a poor factory worker who dreams of escaping his world of endless toil. His wish comes true, though not in a way he would have ever wanted, when his city is attacked by a dark entity called the Halodron. He escapes the conflict, but only to be thrust into a war of other-worldy magic and weaponry.\nAmidst the destruction, history begins to unravel as soldiers of a forgotten war resurface and the secrets of a mysterious technology known as Girrion come to light as its scattered remains suddenly start to \u201creawaken\u201d. With little time and resources, the hero must help save his crumbling empire from its destructive past.\nGIRRION Book 1 The Chrysalis and the Stone is approximately 150 pages long, and is the first installment of a three-book series. Currently Issue 1 and 2 are complete (pages 1 - 52), and Issue 3 (pages 53 - 78) is now in production. This Kickstarter is for Issue 3, but I am including previous books in some of the rewards as well.\nCheck out more of the project at: www.girrion.com\nAge Range: (PG - PG-13 )\n- No sex or bad language\n- No gore. Girrion is primarily about a war so there is cartoon violence similar to the level of Star Wars, but more of it. \nSamples from Issue 1:\nWhy does Girrion need fundraising?\nAny budget from crowdfunding will go partly towards production in terms of artwork, and secondly printing and distributing the comics. Any additional funds beyond the $5,000 goal will go towards hiring more artists to further help with the artwork and get Issue 2 out faster, as well as subsequent issues. \nRewards / Book Format:\nRewards from the Summer 2015 Kickstarter campaign\nSoftcover books are glossy and have some weight to them. They are not the flimsy thin type like some of the standard comics seen at stores.\nThe interior art is full color and has a watercolor feel.\nSoftcover:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBeing that this is not the first comic I've made there aren't too many major challenges with getting the book made, but there are some small ones:\n\nLearning from the last Kickstarter campaign there were some things I had to learn in terms of submitting art to the book printer. If anything was even a little off with art files, it meant delays. Being that I have more experience dealing with them - there should be less problems this time around.\n\nSome of the artwork on certain pages goes fast, some takes very long. There are some complex scenes in this issue with lots of characters and elements that need strong design. Again from past experience the artwork can sometimes take a bit longer than expected.

Players will have to make strategic decisions and work together as they face off against the Brood, a monstrous horde of all new alien foes! But it isn't just the Brood that players will have to worry about this time. Weather effects will drastically change the game each round!\nXenoShyft: Dreadmire is a fully cooperative card game designed for 1-4 players. Working as both a standalone game and an expansion, XenoShyft: Dreadmire can either be played by itself or shuffled into XenoShyft: Onslaught, adding new foes, items and troops. With over 400 cards, and the same immersive art direction as the previous game, XenoShyft: Dreadmire brings the same quantity and quality players have come to expect from the XenoShyft franchise!\nXenoShyft: Dreadmire not only feature new troops, items and foes, but also introduces two all new mechanics to the game:\nAt the start of each turn players will reveal a weather card. This weather card will determine what weather effects will activate. This can throw a major wrench into players' plans as often these weather effects will make the Brood much harder to fight!\nNorTec isn't without options when it comes to these adverse weather effects though! Adapting to their new environment, NorTec has created special items that not only benefit your troops, but also have special abilities that can activate during specific weather.\nXenoShyft: Dreadmire's weather mechanics will give players another level of immersion and difficulty, all while extending the replay value of the game.\nThe XenoShyft franchise is designed to be a tense and challenging experience. Players need to work together and make wise tactical decisions when it comes to the items they purchase and the troops they deploy.\nThrough the process of play-testing XenoShyft: Dreadmire, we've re-tooled the way in which enemies deploy into player lanes. The game now allows for a smoother ramp in difficulty, giving players time to build up their defense before the hardest waves of the Brood appear!\nBut don\u2019t think that time to build up your defenses will make the experience any less challenging! We\u2019ve just worked to make the difficulty curve more gradual for players, allowing for a more streamlined experience that comes down to teamwork and coordination rather than raw luck!\n471 Cards\n     88 Nortec Troop Cards\n     156 Brood Cards\n     1 Brood Reference Card\n     84 Xenosathem Cards\n     100 Item Cards\n     20 Item Tracker Cards\n     6 Division Cards\n     16 Environment Cards\n30 Damage Tokens\n30 Ability Tokens\n4 NorTec Boards\n4 Dreadmire Boards\n1 Item Dashboard\n1 Base HP Dashboard\n1 Wave Dashboard\n1 Rulebook\nBring on the Brood! - $60\nThe Bring on the Brood pledge level gets you a XenoShyft: Dreadmire core box, The Kickstarter exclusive high quality neoprene resources play mat, the Kickstarter exclusive Corpse Puppeteer Boss cards and all applicable stretch goals we unlock!\nCorpse Puppeteer - Kickstarter Exclusive Boss!\nThe Kickstarter Exclusive Corpse Puppeteer Boss is an ever evolving threat that will continue to challenge players in each wave of the game. This devastating foe's power grows each time it's revealed by players. In addition to its increased base power and health every time it appears, the Corpse Puppeteer's special abilities will evolve into harder, more damaging forms.\nThe Corpse Puppeteer is a unique and difficult challenge. Coming as a pack of 3 \"evolving\" cards, this foe is unlike anything faced before in XenoShyft. Acting as a hard mode for an already brutal game, fending off the Corpse Puppeteer is a challenge fans of XenoShyft won't want to miss!\nMake sure your base is running at maximum efficiency with the Kickstarter exclusive resource play mat! Made with industry standard neoprene, this premium play mat provides players with a high quality alternative to the resource boards provided in the box. Normally retailing for $20, backers get this play mat for free!

Delve into a burning hot hellscape, where not only must players fight off the fearsome hordes of the alien threats, but also protect the base from the ravaging Inferno that surrounds them!\n Uncover everything about Xenoshyft: Immolation HERE\nPlease Take Note\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in Germany (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$15 to most states. $30 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.\nCANADA: $10-$20 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $50-$60 to most countries.\nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $30 to most other countries (we can't predict an estimate cost to Malaysia).\nOCEANIA: $13-$25 to Australia. $30 to New Zealand.\nAFRICA: $70 to most countries.\nEUROPE: $10 to Germany.\n     $15-$30 to most other countries.\n     $35 to Norway, Finland, Estland, Lettland, and Latvia.\n     $40 to Bosnia/Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia.\n     $55 to Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Romania.\n     $60 to Iceland, Russia, and Israel.\n     $70 to Greece, Turkey, and Ukraine.\nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available in conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 21st Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as: \nProduction delays \nShipping delays \nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is August 2016, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely. We've successfully delivered Zombicide, Sedition Wars, Guilds of Cadwallon, Zombicide Season 2, Relic Knights, Rivet Wars, Kaosball, Dogs of War, Arcadia Quest, Wrath of Kings, XenoShyft, our Base System, Zombicide Season 3, The World of Smog: On Her Majesty's Service, Rum & Bones, and Blood Rage. We're currently in the final stages of preparing B-Siege for shipment.\n\nWe have three ongoing projects currently: Zombicide: Black Plague which is in the final stage of production, The Others, which is in mid-production, and Arcadia Quest: Inferno is starting production.\n\nPlease refer to our individual project pages if you'd like to check the progress there. Each project is entirely independent from each other, has completely different development teams, and has no effect on the production flow or development of XenoShyft: Dreadmire.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 60 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 60 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 60 days close of the campaign are processed via Paypal only.

And upon your boss card, you will keep track of your posse and your influence.\nYou'll be sending your posse members around town to play poker, gain influence, and purchase buildings.\nEach location offers compelling options of where to place your posse members. Like using a building there, gaining instant influence, or doubling down for extra influence at the risk of not getting any.  \nYou will play a poker hand at EACH location you send a posse member to.\nWinning will get you the \"poker pot\" and any extra influence from a \"double down\" spot. You will need this influence for acquiring buildings later on in the round.\nThe Sheriff's Office is a unique location offering players the ability to change the value or suit of their poker card. It also offers a way to acquire an extra building each round and even activate your 3rd posse member! \nBEWARE! If you're standing in the way of your opponent, they can send their posse member in for a duel and possibly take your spot!\nFighting doesn't go unnoticed around here, or unrewarded for that matter, it is the wild west after all. The winner of the last duel always takes the wanted card.\nAfter the locations have been resolved, and players have gained influence for their winning poker hands, a buying phase occurs. Players can now use their influence to acquire one building from a location where they have a posse member. Remember, hitting up the Sheriff's Office can get you an extra buy during this phase; that can be a real game changer!\nBuildings offer you victory points, access to their abilities, and industry influence. \nAt the end of each round, the player who had the best poker hand at the Town Hall advances one of three industries forward in their rank.\nAt the end of six rounds,or as many bullets as a revolver can hold, the game is over. The industries have now been ranked 1st through 3rd and the majority share holders (players with the most industry influence) will be paid bonus victory points respectively. Players add that to the sum of their victory points gained from acquired buildings, with the wanted player gaining an extra 2, and the player who has the most victory points is the winner!  \nClick to enlarge! *this stretch goal does not increase the card count of base or deluxe.\n                                             Upgrades the Premium Print 'N Play and will also be made public on BGG for all TEG players.

It shares similarities to card games like Magic the Gathering or Hearthstone, but in a simpler easy-to-pick-up-and-play way, akin to Love Letter. Anyone older than 10 who has a knack for card games should enjoy themselves.\nWhat is Control?\nWith mechanics inspired by Cuttle, Control is combat card game for 2\u20134 players where rounds last 5\u201315 minutes. Players are time travelers who\u2019ve been caught in a rupture in spacetime and displaced outside time. Each player must use Fuel Cells (the cards) to refuel their own time machine or stop other players from refueling theirs first.\nWhat\u2019s the Goal?\nTo escape the rupture, a player needs to reach a Fuel Cell Charge of 21 or more at the end of his or her turn. Whoever does so first closes the rupture, leaving all other travelers lost outside time.\nWhat's in the Box?\n54 Poker-Size Cards (13 different card types with a custom illustration for each type)\nThe Instruction Manual\nCounters (Upgradable through Stretch Goals)\nPlatform Insert (To hold cards)\nWhat are the Rules?\nThe deck is shuffled and each player is dealt five cards. Cards are either Silver or Bronze Fuel Cells with their Fuel Cell Charge in the top left ranging from 1-10.\nOn their turn, a player chooses ONE of the following:\nDraw a card. A player may not draw if they have seven cards in hand.\nInstall a Silver or Bronze Fuel Cell in their area of play. The Fuel Cell Charge on installed cards goes toward a player's goal of 21 or more to win. Abilities on Silver Fuel Cells are activated when installed. \nBurn a Bronze Fuel Cell to the discard pile to activate its ability.\nDefuse an opponent\u2019s fuel cells with a Fuel Cell of your own of equal or higher value.\nThat\u2019s it. With two to three players, it's every-man-for-himself. In a four-player game, teams of two must work together to make their escape.

You can switch your reward level at any time before this campaigns ends.\nThe world is again threatened with war! As the War Minister of your small nation, you have been tasked with confronting aggression by developing atomic bombs for your country. Your spies have stolen the needed technology, but you need to acquire the materials and personnel to get the job done before your rival nations do. Once someone has built 10 kilotons of bombs, the final round will finish, and the player with the most bomb points will win, their nation\u2019s survival assured!\nTo do this, you will be playing cards representing the training and use of teams of laborers, scientists, and engineers to complete various plans, until you have assembled enough bombs to win! Here is a example of a lucky hand being played:\nMP: Chain Reaction is a stand alone game based on the popular \"Manhattan Project\" board game by Minion Games, this is a simpler card-only game using dual-purpose cards in a quick and exciting race to completion.\nThe Basics:\nPLAYERS: 1-5 (yes, there is a solo version)\nRECOMMENDED AGES: 8+\nPLAY TIME: 20-30 minutes\nGamer Skills:\nCounting & Math\nLogical & Critical Decision Making\nPattern/Color Matching\nStrategy & Tactics\nHand/Resource Management\nLearning Curve: Child \u2013 Easy Adult \u2013 Easy\nTheme & Narrative: Fear and paranoia is a powerful motivator\nInstead of stretch goals we've chosen to offer a deluxe version of the complete game from day one. This version will be exclusive to you, our Kickstarter backers.\nThe retail version of the game comes in a nice durable tuck-box. It will contain 108 high-quality poker sized cards:\n8 Factory cards\n20 Mining cards\n7 University cards\n14 Enrichment Plants cards\n6 Special Agent cards\n4 Landmarks cards\n13 Bomb Plan cards\n4 Bomb Loaded cards\n31 Resource cards\n1 Start Player card\nThe deluxe version will come in a telescoping two part box and has all the stuff from the standard version, plus these optional but handy wooden bits:\n25 Yellow-cake wooden cubes\n25 Uranium wooden disks\nSince the Deluxe Version has out sold the standard Retail version on this campaign, we will upgrade the wood bits to nuke symbol and mushroom cloud shapes!\nDeluxe Edition Box Example\nAll pledge levels include the Print and Play files which will be released shortly after the campaign ends.\nYou can download the rough rules: HERE\nGame play is simple, but never the same way twice. The goal is to claim the Bomb cards for points. This takes resources to accomplish.\nResources are earned by \u201cchaining\u201d cards together. You place a card sideways to use it as workers and vertical to make use of the building. You then play another card that uses the outputs of the previous card as its input. Which, in turn, provides its own output. And so it goes until the eventual output is what the player wants. Most of the time this is going to be Yellow Cake when the game begins, followed by \u201cUranium\u201d, and eventually being able to provide enough resources to build a bomb.\nThe Manhattan Project: Chain Reaction can be played by 1 person. The game is set up and played liked normal. Where applicable, a small number of cards list how they are used if being played in a solitaire game. The goal for the player is to earn as many points as possible before the Industry draw deck is depleted. After that, the player\u2019s goal is to beat their previous high score.\nHOW TO PLAY VIDEO by Eric Jome:\n .\nEDO's GAME PREVIEWS:\nFATHER GEEK REVIEW\n\"Challenging, engaging, and fun, I really enjoyed my time with The Manhattan Project: Chain Reaction. It was enjoyed by all our players for different reasons that ranged from creative play to engrossing problem solving. Most importantly, everyone had fun. If you enjoy card games where you must build and connect your logic to achieve victory, do sit down and play The Manhattan Project: Chain Reaction.\"\nMuch more details on how to play and feedback from all ages of players can be found here in his complete write up:\nhttp://fathergeek.com/manhattan-project-chain-reaction_prepub/\nWe won the Father Geek Approved seal which means this game is great for kids, casual gamers, and heavy gamers.\n* ACHIEVED! All Deluxe copies will come with these enhanced wood bits!\nWhile not a true stretch goal, we have decided that if we sell a total of 1500 or more Deluxe copies (which as of Sunday the 17th we're at 1132) then we will pay for upgraded wood bits to make the Deluxe version of the game even more special. These will be a solid color bit with a stamp/print of one color over the top of them. Similar to the skulls we did in our Dead Men Tell No Tales campaign (that turned out great).\nOur goal was to offer the best special game in the Deluxe addition from the start and not to make you all chase stretch goals. We realize that's not as exciting but we hope you enjoy what we are offering.\nSHIPPING EXPLAINED\nShipping is already included in ALL pledge level prices.\nWe are paying roughly $6 toward shipping for most backers (a bit more for non-USA). When you buy a bundle of 4 games, we offer more of a discount. That makes USA shipping included, but for other countries, we must charge what USPS charges us (minus the $6). Make sure you only back the reward level for your region.\nWe will ship with a value of $15-22 which should avoid VAT and import taxes in most countries. We've attempted many methods of dealing with shipping to Europe, and ended up losing money on all of them. We realize shipping is expensive, so if you prefer to wait, this game will eventually be in your local stores worldwide.\nAlso note, that backers of this campaign will get their games weeks before anyone else as we ship to distribution at least a week after we've finished shipping to backers.\nNOTE: The deluxe version will only available here at Kickstarter and a small number of direct sales at conventions and our own website. It will NOT be in game stores.\nWe have been publishing quality games and accessories for over 5 years and have run over a dozen successful Kickstarter campaigns including the highly rated game The Manhattan Project. Pledge with confidence that we will fulfill your rewards with the highest quality and in a timely manner.\nABOUT THE DESIGNER:\nJames Mathe is the owner of Minion Games as well as a few hobby game stores in the Milwaukee area. He created RPGNow.com (DriveThurRPG) in 2001 and has since helped thousands of people learn how to publish games and run Kickstarters. One of the goals at Minion Games has been to get more unknown designer games to the market, so many of James' designs still sit on the shelf. He designed and published the game Those Pesky Humans when starting Minion Games.

I have far too much stuff to move, and besides I cannot see my dreadfully annoying neighbors win. I will not allow it. If they want to play games than I will play games. If they want to compete to annoy me out of my own home I will make sure that I will NOT go out quietly.\" \n\"Jim and I decided to move here because we thought it would be a safe place to raise Tommy.

I'm Joel Hodgson. \nOnce upon a time, a television series called MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 was born. We debuted on Minneapolis' KTMA, local television, on Thanksgiving Day 1988, as the world was in the final throes of Teddy Ruxpin-mania. That was almost thirty years ago, but for some reason, people still seem to like the show \u2013 it\u2019s a mitzvah!\nOur show has had a long, strange run. Across a UHF channel, a cable network, cancellation, a feature film, then another cable network, the show lasted for 12 years, two generations of hosts and puppeteers, 2 Emmy nominations and a total of 197 episodes before we got canceled again for good in 1999. Sadly, it was just as Prince predicted.\nBut maybe that's not where it all ends.\nStarting today, we finally get a chance to bring back MST3K.\nWith your help, we can create a new season of MST3K, prove there's still an audience, and maybe even convince a network to bring us back for more.\nGreat question.\nThe simplest answer is that there are a lot of cheesy movies left to riff, and a lot of people who would still enjoy watching them with us.\nPlus, I think there's a place for us. Nowadays, riffing is everywhere! Many people claim that MST3K created a shift in the way people watch TV shows, and that now, as a result, the fields of entertainment have been plowed and readied for a riffing renaissance.\nI mean, look at the influence it\u2019s had... Everyone riffs on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. Hell, there are ten to twelve people who are still, unironically, riffing on MySpace and Friendster.\nIn a world where riffing has become as common as our national pastime, baseball, it makes sense: like baseball, everyone knows how to play, but sometimes it feels good to just sit back and watch the original movie riffing team take a whack at it. And if we came back, imagine all the riffs we could make about things like Uber or Cards Against Humanity!\nAlso, there\u2019s a pile of scriptural evidence in whichever sacred text that you hold dear to prove that we need more seasons of MST3K\u2026 so when you share on social media, you know you\u2019re not going to offend anybody.\nYou know, I just read that last sentence... and actually, I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re going to offend everybody. But at least you can rest assured that you\u2019ll offend everyone equally.\nWe do, and here's why: I think it's because MST3K is more than just movie riffing. It's a stranger and denser recipe than just saying smart aleck things to a forgotten movie, but I think this is the secret ingredient: we believed that it's easiest to survive the cheesy movie that we're living in with friends who keep us from taking it all too seriously.\nNow, I don\u2019t want to get too maudlin about it, because being too serious is the enemy of comedy. We weren't trying to send a message: job #1 was always to make a funny show. But while we were doing that, I hope we also helped show the kids that society, and the stupid things we say and do to each other, are \"just a show, and you should really just relax.\u201d\nYeah, this is what I was afraid of. Now I\u2019m starting to sound like the Dr. Bronner's label. Next question?\nThe simplest answer is: until now, we couldn't bring MST3K back.\nI've been thinking about ways to re-animate MST3K for over a decade... and over the last 15 years, I've met thousands of you who said that you wanted MST3K back too. But two things have finally changed that make this the right time. And I'm not talking about the legalization of marijuana or the proliferation of water jet pack use.\n1. Crowdfunding gives fans the power to get what they want.\nIn less than two years, I've watched fans use crowdfunding to bring back Veronica Mars, Reading Rainbow and Super Troopers \u2013 all cult favorites, like us \u2013 and it made me wonder how MSTies would respond if we had the chance to return. Now we're going to find out\u2026 and then maybe LeVar Burton can finally stop acting like he\u2019s so much better than us.\n2. We had to work through some complicated legal issues.\nEven though we've always wanted to bring MST3K back, it wasn't that easy. Thanks to the Last Will and Testament of one eccentric old heiress, the rights were tied up for years. It took time to work those issues out, but with the help of my friends at Shout Factory, a special chokehold I perfected in WuDang that I like to call \u201cThe Persuader,\u201d and a night I had to spend in a haunted house as a term of the the old lady\u2019s will, we succeeded.\nThis summer, we finally got all of the rights cleared up\u2026 and now, like Orpheus, we can now descend into hell to hang out with a couple of wisecracking robots.\nNow we're talking!\nOur Kickstarter campaign has two really important goals.\nAs soon as we reach our minimum goal of $2,000,000, we'll be able to make three new feature length episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000. But then, for each additional $1.1 million we raise, we can make three more... up to a full season of 12 episodes!\n(If you're wondering why new episodes cost so much \u2013 especially the first three \u2013 keep going down the page to \"HOW WE'LL USE YOUR MONEY,\" or take a look at the Backer Update where I explained the budget in detail.)\nHere's a simple diagram to help you remember our goals:\nIf we can raise even more than that, I'd love to shoot some (or all) of the new season LIVE in front of an audience \u2013 and maybe even stream the show live on the internet! (Oh yeah: I just saw your eyes light up.)\nFinally, if we raise $1 BILLION \u2013 stay with me on this one \u2013 we\u2019re going to adopt a real live teenage boy and \u201cTruman Show\u201d him into believing he is the Pumaman!\nHear us out, because this goal is just as important: we're not just crowdfunding because we need funding. \nWe're also doing it because we need the crowd!\nIf we want a lot more MST3K, we need to work together to prove that there's still an audience out there that wants MST3K \u2013 and that this isn't all some pitiable delusion \u2013 so that we can find a network or online platform who will agree to pick up the show and keep it going\u2026 hopefully for another 200+ episodes.\nEven if you can only spare $5 or $10, every extra backer helps us send a message to the networks: it's time to #BringBackMST3K.\n____\nOkay. It's time for me to put away the grease gun and give you your marching orders.\nIf any of this rings true to you, we need your help now to spread the word. Back in the day, every episode of MST3K ended with a message that encouraged fans to \u201cKeep Circulating the Tapes.\u201d And you guys did.\nThose grassroots efforts helped MST3K find friends and fans at a time when the rest of show business didn\u2019t quite know what to make of us. It was social media in its most primitive form... and because of you, it worked.\nToday's, it's time to update that phrase for the internet age. If you're with us, this is your call to action, MSTies.\nAnd while you're at it, you can help out even more by taking a minute to follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. (Apparently those matter more than Nielsen ratings, now!)\nListen, I know this Kickstarter idea isn\u2019t for everyone. Neither was Mystery Science Theater 3000. But just like MST3K itself, I know the right people will get it.\nThanks for reading. I hope you'll join us. \nJoel\nDear People of the Internet,\nWelcome to my first-ever Official Crow-Funding Campaign. Tee Hee!\nAs #1 Golden Shiny Boy Champion, I need a place to shine bright and inspire. I want to be a part of your life again, serving in both a wind-beneath-your-wings and an ASRM capacity. You know you still want me, baby, but allow me to tell you why.\nFirst, I like POP! Figures. I intend to roll most of the money into Funko stock. Plus a few hat parties.\n\nAlso, I\u2019d like to open up a long-overdue public dialogue on Cee-Lo Green and his fashion choices.\n\nThen, I plan on turning at least a thousand dollars\u2019 worth of funds into pennies, which I will press into elongated souvenir coins at theme parks and fairs.\n\nFinally, if you are still undecided, I ask you to consider this: after years of waiting, I will finally get to decide who lives and who dies. You don\u2019t want to be on the wrong list, do you?\nI look forward to your loyal service in the many years of the New Golden Age to come.\nYour Future Supreme Being,\nCrow T. Robot\nHello, Ladies.\nI'm pleased to be with you again. It's been too long. Now that we're about to be a huge crowdfunding hit, I've got a few things I'd like to discuss with you.\nIt turns out that the last 15 years have been kind to our legacy: we're famous now. And not internet famous, either. Real famous. I have lots of female fans.\nAngelina, Scarlett, and many women named Madison: I've got parts in the new show with your names on them. You can come over and we can run lines in my bungalow, and I\u2019ll make us a curry. Then if things get \u201cconsensual,\u201d so be it.\nI\u2019ll also pretty much be the \u201ctroubleshooter\u201d on this Kickstarter campaign, because I understand how you think and I\u2019m a master of social media. My god: you do realize that I\u2019m the uncredited creator of both memes and avatars?\nI\u2019M ALSO THE FIRST SENTIENT BEING TO TYPE A MESSAGE IN ALL CAPS.\nWhat are you waiting for? Get out to the Kickstarter polls and start voting.\nYours,\nTom Servo\nHey everyone. It's Joel again.\nLook, I know what you're wondering, so go ahead\u2026 just say it.\nBelieve me, man. I get it. If it cost $2 million just to make three episodes, we'd be spending almost $700K per show! And you're right: by itself, an episode of MST3K doesn't cost nearly that much. \nThe real explanation is pretty simple.\n1. We don't get to keep all of the money we raise on Kickstarter! \nCAMPAIGN FEES: Out of the first $2,000,000, we have to pay about 8% \u2013 that's $160,000 \u2013 in fees to Kickstarter and the credit card processor.\n\nREWARD & SHIPPING COSTS: Then, we have to design, produce, print, sort and ship all of the rewards we're offering in exchange for your pledge. (Those t-shirts aren't free, you know!) That costs about 27%, so that's another $540,000.\n(We're not charging you twice for shipping, I promise. Even though Kickstarter asks you to add more for shipping, they count that money toward the total we've raised, even though we still have to spend it on, you know\u2026 shipping!)\nSo, out of the first $2,000,000 we raise, we have to spend $700,000 just on the costs of this Kickstarter campaign!\n2. Then, we have to spend a lot on startup costs just to get the show going. \nTo shoot new episodes, there's a lot we'll need to do: creating concept art and designs, building sets, making models, creating costumes, adding new features to upgrade the robots, and all sorts of other things. All of that work costs money, which is why our first $2,000,000 includes $550,000 for startup costs. The good part is that every penny of that ends up on screen where you can see it.\n3. But... the more episodes we make, the less each episode costs! \nWe have to spend the same amount up front, no matter how many episodes we make. If we only make 3 episodes, these costs increase the budget for each episode by $183K\u2026 but if we make a full 12, they only increase it by $46K each!\nAnyway, once you take out the CAMPAIGN, REWARD and STARTUP COSTS, there's a lot less than $2,000,000 left. In fact, that leaves just $750K for three episodes, which \u2013 I hope \u2013 sounds a lot more reasonable than $2,000,000!\nAt the end of the day, our goal is to make each episode for around $250K.\nTo put that in perspective, that means we're spending less to create 90 minutes of MST3K than even the low-end reality shows spend to make 22 minutes! (Really makes ya think, don't it?) \nNow, if you're as tired of reading as I am of writing, here are some wicked cool graphics that explain all of this:\nI know not everyone will want this much explanation, but if I'm asking you to trust me with your money, I think it's important to be crystal clear about how we're using it. \nPlus, $750K for each set of three episodes feels a lot better than $2,000,000. \n(But man, I'd hate to try to sell a car to you people. Tough crowd!)\nHopefully by now, you're already on board. Maybe you're not even reading this. Maybe you've already made your contribution, selected your rewards, and are now rushing around the internet helping spread the good word to all of your MST3K-deprived friends!\nBut if you're still on the fence, maybe I can make it easier for you.\nPersonally, I think the most compelling reason to help out is that you want to see new episodes of MST3K\u2026 and not just for you. Think of the friends and family who you can finally introduce to the new MST3K: the one with a fresh new cast, fresh new riffs, and zesty new cheesy movies!\nOn the other hand, let\u2019s not any of us forget: this is Kickstarter. I know that you know that that\u2019s gonna mean some cool rewards for helping us out. And for a show that\u2019s never really been about cool merch...I think we\u2019ve finally got some!\nUPDATE! We've gotten a lot of questions asking exactly what's included with each package, so we've put together another helpful little chart:\nYou can see all of the rewards on the right side of the page, but here are a few highlights:\nBecome... Part of MYSTERY SCIENCE HISTORY!\nAll backers \u2013 no matter what you pledge \u2013 will be invited to join the new MST3K Information Club. (It's like the old MST3K Info Club, only better. And modern. And more exclusive. And wider in the hips.) Over the next year, we'll invite you to help us rediscover MST3K and get it oiled up and running smoothly. You'll be part of the process!\nRead... Our Page-Turning Insider Updates \nWe don't just want to take your cash and walk away: we want to take your cash and talk away! Most Kickstarter projects promise \"exclusive behind-the-scenes updates,\" but this time, I mean it: I've already started planning things I want to share with you. It'll be like getting email from me, Crow and Servo for at least a year.\nPossess... Amazing, Terrifying, Heart-Warming New MST3K Swag\nBefore the end of the campaign, we'll start sharing the designs we're planning for some of the #BringBackMST3K swag you can get, including the OFFICIAL T-SHIRT ($50+), OFFICIAL MUG ($75+), OFFICIAL KEYCHAIN ($100+), OFFICIAL POSTER ($150), and many more. We've got several amazing artists working on this stuff. I can't wait for you to see it.\nTake Control.... of the New Episodes!Bringing back MST3K isn't enough power for you? Great! For real high-rollers, we're offering all sorts of ways to be part of the episodes themselves. You can\u2026\nSteal the hearts of millions when you... APPEAR IN AN EPISODE! \nThrow your weight around and\u2026 BECOME A PRODUCER! \nKickstart your new riffing career and\u2026 HELP WRITE AN EPISODE!\nImmortalize your favorite inside joke with\u2026 A PERSONAL RIFF!\nOwn and Command... Your OWN Robot Friend!\nThis one is difficult for me, but I want to make sure this Kickstarter succeeds, so I'm willing to make the sacrifice: a very limited number of you can KEEP THE ACTUAL CROW and/or SERVO FEATURED IN A NEW EPISODE! They'll record a personalized video for you, and then we'll ship them off to your doorstep. When we're done shooting.\n1. FOLLOW \"@MST3K\" ON ALL OF OUR SOCIAL CHANNELS.Be sure to follow our official accounts on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. Ask your fellow MSTies to follow them too! Tell them that those numbers have a really big impact when we start asking networks to #BringBackMST3K for more new seasons.\n2. CIRCULATE THE MESSAGES AT THE END OF EACH UPDATE. At the end of each Backer Update, Crow or Servo will share a message or image that you can copy and paste to share with your friends, to help spread the word.\n3. KEEP CIRCULATING THE FACTS\u2026 NICELY! I know there are still some fans out there who are skeptical about this Kickstarter, about why MST3K costs so much money and how we'll spend it, about bringing in a third cast, about who is and isn't going to be involved\u2026 So, like they say on the subway, \"If you see something, say something!\" If you hear fans insisting that $2MM is more than we need to make three episodes, or that the old team isn't invited back, I hope you'll share the facts with them. (Please be nice, though! The internet needs a lot more of that.)\n4. JOIN (OR START) A LOCAL MST3K MEETUP GROUP.\nThe internet is great, but sometimes riffing is even better when you can meet old (and new) friends in person! There are already a lot of MST3K groups on meetup.com, but if there's not one near you, start one now and invite your friends! We've got some events planned for this month, and we'll be calling on all the local groups to be part of them.\nAs long as we have the funds we need, we'll be able to produce new episodes. That part is easy! But over the last month, I've had lots of time to think about all the possible risks and challenges MST3K could face...\nMAYBE THE WORLD HAS CHANGED!\nMST3K has been away for a long time. YouTube didn't even exist when we shot the last episode of MST3K. (Yes, Virginia, there was a world before YouTube. People laughed more back then. Colors were brighter. There were concerts in the park.)\nI've imagined many hypothetical risks:\nWhat if no one enjoys watching B-movies anymore? \n What if you don't want us talking while you do? \n What if there is an unknown virus that has killed mankind's ability to enjoy a good solid ironic viewing? \nWhat if kids playing in \u201cGarry\u2019s Mod\u201d on Twitch have made the whole thing meaningless? \nWhat if robot-shaped puppets don\u2019t have the overwhelming cultural significance they once did? \nWhat if our collective consciousness can\u2019t take the excitement, and the entire world becomes a flash mob, and we all steal our own TVs?\nWhat if all eight billion people on the planet become a single \u201cImprov Everywhere\u201d troupe, but don\u2019t have anyone left to surprise?!?\nAs you can see, this whole endeavor is fraught with risks.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've been over this!

Future pre-orders and add-ons can be made on our website.\nDesigned by Jamey Stegmaier (Viticulture & Euphoria) and based on the art and worldbuilding of Jakub Rozalski, Scythe is a 4x game (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) set in an alternate-history, 1920s Eastern Europe. Scythe tells the stories of 5 factions competing over an unclaimed patch of land surrounding the mysterious Factory.\nDuring Scythe's 750+ blind playtests, the playtesters consistently said they most enjoyed:\nthe dual benefits of the upgrade system (increase an action benefit and decrease a cost)\nthe distinctly different faction and mech abilities\nthe thematic choices presented by the encounter cards\nthe asymmetry and variability created by random pairings of faction and player mats\nthe twist to area control due to all resources being kept on the board\nCheck out the Scythe rules and playtest print-and-play files to see how Scythe blends an engine-building system inspired by Terra Mystica with a deterministic combat system influenced by Kemet. Renders of the 25 miniatures in Scythe are below the \"What's in the Box?\" image.\nTo add items onto your pledge, manually add the $ amount during the project. We don't use a pledge manager, so all pledges must be made in full by November 5. You can mix and match up to 3 total games (any version) and any number of add-ons. On the post-project survey, you will tell us the various items that comprise your pledge.\nEach player is represented on the board by a character and their animal companion (1 miniature). Each character miniature has a 25mm base and a height of 36-58mm.\nEach faction has 4 mechs in their faction color that can be deployed during the game. Each mech miniature has a 30mm base and a height of 26-36mm.\nThis is an example of a faction mat (the Rusviet faction).

We'll even pay for return shipping.\nThe Factory promo pack contains 6 extra Factory cards for Kickstarter backers. The promo pack will be available for an additional cost to those who discover Scythe after the Kickstarter campaign.\nIt may not be these exact Factory cards that end up in the promo pack.\nThe custom metal coins  (80 total) featured in the Premium, Collector's, and Art Connoisseur Edition games were designed specifically for Scythe. The set of coins is available for order by itself on the Stonemaier Games website for $25 (+ shipping) or as an add-on to any copy of the game for $22.\nThe plastic resource containers (4 total) in the Premium, Collector's, and Art Connoisseur Edition games allow for easy storage, setup, and distribution of the various tokens and coins in Scythe. There's room for exactly 4 of these containers in the Scythe box.\nPlastic container with coin prototypes.\nThe board extension in the Collector's and Art Connoisseur Editions slides next to the back side of the game board, creating a complete board with +50% bigger hexes (the content is the same; see Update 3). All units and resources in Scythe are kept on the board, so the larger hexes provide more space.\nThe game board is 624x818mm, and it grows to 818x936mm with the extension. It is available as an add-on to any copy of the game for $10 (every game board is double-sided) and will be available to order from our website by itself for $12 (+ shipping) after the project ends.\nThe realistic resource tokens (made out of resin or zinc) in the Collector's and Art Connoisseur Editions replace the wooden resource tokens (there are no wooden resource tokens in those editions). They include 80 tokens (20 each) for food, metal, oil, and wood. These tokens are available in our treasure chests (one in each chest), as well as in an add-on to any copy of the game for $21.\nThe individually-numbered boxes in the Collector's and Art Connoisseur Editions are randomly assigned. The limit of these boxes will be determined by the total number of backers at those levels.\nThe art book included with the Art Connoisseur Edition is a 100-page, full-color, hardback collection of the art featured in Scythe, as well as other pieces in Jakub Rozalski's acclaimed 1920s series. The book will measure approximately 250x290mm. It's available for pre-order by itself on the Stonemaier Games website for $25 (+ shipping) or as an add-on to any copy of the game for $23. The art book will be packed externally from the game box.\nThe wooden resource tokens aren't in the Collector's and Art Connoisseur Editions, so if you want both one of those games and wooden resources (or if you just want extra resources with any version of Scythe), please add $10 to your pledge. This is for an external pack of 20 food/grain, 20 metal, 20 wood, and 20 oil tokens.\nSamples on the left; final colors on the right.\nWe ship games in bulk to fulfillment centers around the world to reduce customs fees & VAT and to keep shipping prices low (this method is explained here; country codes are here).\nBackers are limited to 3 total games per pledge (a mix of any 3 versions of the game is fine; only pay the shipping fee once per pledge, not once per game).

We owe a huge debt of gratitude to all of them, especially to Barry Schmaling (who built the playtester forum) and all of the lead playtesters. They had a lot to say about Scythe, but here are a few of our favorite quotes:\n\u201cFarm your little piece of the world, spread out and colonise as much as you can, or rampage with mechs projecting lethal force over your opponents. This game has it all and with so many routes to victory, no two games are the same.\u201d \u2014 Stephen \u2018Azrael\u2019 Ogden\n\u201cScythe is an excellent blend of resource management and conflict which also manages to leave you with a delightful sense of having told a story.\" \u2014 Andrew Busam\n\u201cThe Automa is challenging, relentless, and at times unforgiving, but it's also a whole lot of fun. It's a worthy adversary that earns a begrudging respect.\u201d \u2014 Jeremiah Power\nWhile we don't offer existing inventory or unrelated products as add-ons through Kickstarter, we offer other Stonemaier products on our website. These items will ship right away and cannot be held until Scythe ships.\nViticulture, Tuscany, Euphoria, Between Two Cities, and our treasure chests are also available from your friendly local game store.\nJamey's book, A Crowdfunder's Strategy Guide: Build a Better Business by Building Community, is available in a number of online and offline locations.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThrough Stonemaier Games, Jamey Stegmaier has raised over $1.4 million on Kickstarter and has delivered over 20,000 individual rewards to backers within a few months of the estimated delivery date (most are on time or early). He is an avid backer and gamer, and his book about crowdfunding was published in September 2015: http://stonemaiergames.com/kickstarter/book/\n\nHowever, Scythe presented three specific new challenges: miniatures, shipping, and balance.\n\nThis is our first time working with plastic miniatures. We had heard horror stories about other projects involving miniatures, and we've experienced a few as backers. So we wanted to start early to avoid some of the delays that can occur as the result of miniatures. We started working with Jakub and his 3D modelers in March, using Shapeways to print each version of the sculpts to see how they worked on the game board. We also worked closely with Panda's team throughout the process to make sure the sculpts are feasible and durable. We've created the molds for the miniatures and are ready for production.\n\nWe've picked up and dropped fulfillment partners over time, keeping those who pack our games well and excel at communication. Because shipping is particularly important for Scythe\u2014a big game with a box that we want delivered in pristine condition\u2014we tested out two new-to-us fulfillment partners (Funagain in the US and Snakes & Lattes in Canada) on our previous project in preparation for Scythe. We add those two to Ideaspatcher in Europe, Good Games in Australia, and Agility in China, all three of which we've worked on in the past and have had excellent results.\n\nOne of the main features of Scythe's gameplay is asymmetry between factions. It's tough to balance an asymmetric game, so after we got Scythe to a good place with local playtesters, we ran 3 different waves of multi-player blind playtesting and 2 waves of solo blind playtesting. The huge amount of anecdotal and quantitative data we collected as a result helped us ensure that Scythe is extremely well balanced (and fun!).\n\nIf you would like to know more about what we learned from our Kickstarter experiences and research, go to http://stonemaiergames.com/kickstarter/full-list-chronological/ to see 160+ Kickstarter Lessons to help you create a successful project too.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #46", "update_userinfo": "Introducing the Scythe Modular Board", "update_content": "Hi!

(And Mac and Linux!) \nHere's an EARLY in-engine visual exploration that our art team's been working on. It\u2019s still work-in-progress, not final\u2026 but we just had to show you guys!\n> WHERE\nThe BattleTech Universe is one of near-constant warfare and feudal political intrigue, where great noble houses vie for dominance of a vast region of space known as the Inner Sphere. It's a universe of flawed heroes, fallen empires and grey moral realities. Great families vie for supremacy, with alliances and betrayals constantly shifting the balance of power.\nThe Inner Sphere, circa 3025.\n> WHEN\nOur BATTLETECH game is set in the popular 3025 Succession Wars Era of the BattleTech Universe - often referred to as \"Classic BattleTech\".\nClick to view a timeline of the Inner Sphere. (2271 - 3025)\n> WHO\nThe project is led by:\nJordan Weisman, creator of BattleTech and MechWarrior, Shadowrun, Crimson Skies, and more.\nMike McCain, Creative Director of Harebrained Schemes' critically-acclaimed series of Shadowrun games.\nMitch Gitelman, Producer of the classic MechCommander series of tactical 'Mech combat games.\nOur studio, Harebrained Schemes, has delivered three successful Kickstarter campaigns - Shadowrun Returns / Dragonfall, Golem Arcana, and Shadowrun: Hong Kong - to rave reviews and very positive responses from our Kickstarter backers. Kickstarter allows our studio to remain independent and to focus on making games directly for our fans.\n> WHY\nBecause we love BattleTech, and there hasn't been a turn-based, classic BattleTech game on PC in over 20 years! Above all else, our goal with this project is to deliver an authentic BattleTech experience. Accomplishing that goal isn't just about designing great 'Mech combat - it's about fully realizing the BattleTech Universe, its characters, its factions, and its stories.\n> HOW\nWith your help! CONGRATULATIONS ON REACHING STAGE 4 - PVP Multiplayer!\nYou did it!\nBATTLETECH is in development for PC, Mac, and Linux in English and will be delivered in standard and DRM-free versions on Steam, GoG, and Humble stores. The game will also be made available in German, French, and Russian (with localized text, and audio subtitles) in a post-launch update. Other platforms and languages may be announced later. BATTLETECH is expected to launch in early 2017.\nBATTLETECH is set in a universe at perpetual war, fought by militarized factions utilizing huge, mechanized combat vehicles called BattleMechs.\nFollowing centuries of space colonization and the rise of six Great Noble Houses, treachery undermined the Star League and toppled its First Lord. The rulers of the five remaining Houses each proclaimed themselves the new First Lord, and so the Succession Wars began - hundreds of years of mechanized armies, scavenged technology, and political machinations.\nNow, in 3025, each faction is near its breaking point. An uneasy stalemate sets in as the Houses scrape to rebuild their holdings, reinforce their worlds, and restock their 'Mech armies. But the conflict continues as the nobility drives their agendas forward covertly through the use of mercenaries\u2026   \nWhether maintained by a House army, or passed down within a MechWarrior family from generation to generation, BattleMechs reign supreme on the thirty-first century battlefield. These massive weapon platforms - ranging from seven to sixteen meters in height, and twenty to one hundred tons in weight - form the backbone of the Great Houses' interstellar armies.\n'Mechs are rare, and often passed down from generation to generation within a noble family.\nOver the 200 years of the Succession Wars, attrition has eaten away at the resources of the Great Houses, and the number of working BattleMechs on the field has dwindled. By 3025, field-ready 'Mechs are a precious commodity, and keeping them running is a tactical necessity.\nWe're excited that Piranha Games, creators of MechWarrior Online, are sharing their incredible roster of Inner Sphere BattleMech models with us for BATTLETECH. Not only are their 'Mechs wonderfully detailed, using the same models adds to the continuity of the BattleTech Universe.\nWe\u2019re also very happy to be working closely with Catalyst Game Labs, publisher of the BattleTech tabletop board games and novels. Even though Jordan created the BattleTech Universe over 30 years ago, the talented folks at Catalyst have been the keepers of the flame for years, and we appreciate their help in ensuring that we deliver an authentic BattleTech experience.\nBecause we\u2019re an independent game studio with big dreams for an amazing game.\nWe know that to do 'Mech combat right will be a substantial investment - in fact, Harebrained Schemes has budgeted over a million dollars to self-fund the STAGE 1 SKIRMISH GAME (see below), and we've already started pre-production. We\u2019re confident that we\u2019ve scoped the project appropriately, and that we can deliver this version of the game without any Kickstarter support.\nBut, we also know that BattleTech isn't just about big stompy robots battling it out. There\u2019s so much more we\u2019d like to include in this game! A full single-player campaign. Full control of your career as a mercenary. PVP Multiplayer. That\u2019s where you come in!\nThe scope of this project expands in the four major FUNDING STAGES below - so that no matter which funding level we attain, we\u2019re sure to deliver a great game worthy of the BattleTech name. Help us co-fund BATTLETECH and let\u2019s see how big this game can get!\nNaturally, 'Mech combat is the cornerstone of any great BattleTech game, so that\u2019s where we\u2019re starting development. HBS is self-funding a complete 'Mech battlefield experience in the form of the STAGE 1 SKIRMISH GAME.\nOur goal is to craft a combat system for BATTLETECH that\u2019s the perfect blend of tactical depth, speed of play, and meaningful unit customization. As we did with our Shadowrun games, we intend to capture the *spirit* of the original tabletop rules, while designing the best PC game we can. That said, Shadowrun and BattleTech are very different games! For one thing, Shadowrunners like to hide behind cover, while \u2018Mechs\u2026 squash cover. Expect turn-based combat in BattleTech to feel very different than a more cover-based combat system like Shadowrun\u2019s\nOn the battlefield, you'll command a Lance of four 'Mechs in turn-based combat. We\u2019d like a typical skirmish to be complete-able within about 30 minutes, without sacrificing the tactical depth that any BattleTech game demands. All of our systems will be designed with a \u201clayered\u201d approach in mind - surfacing the information you need for quick decision-making, while also allowing you to drill-down into detailed stats and unit management options.\nThink of the STAGE 1 SKIRMISH GAME like a personal 'Mech command simulation - you\u2019ll be able to set the parameters and difficulty level of each skirmish game, challenging yourself to defeat larger and larger AI-controlled enemy forces over more and more difficult terrain. Or, choose from a variety of pre-built combat encounters created by our design team.\nBetween skirmishes, customize your BattleMechs in the 'Mech Bay. Choose from over twenty-five 3025-era Inner Sphere 'Mech chassis, and configure the weapon loadout, armor, heat sinks, and paint scheme for each. If you want to dive even deeper, tweak their engine, gyros, actuators, and shock absorbers - all of which will impact the 'Mech\u2019s battlefield performance in different ways.\n\nIn the Ready Room, select the best pilots for the 'Mechs you\u2019ve configured. Each MechWarrior will have their own 'Mech and weapon specializations, as well as certain special abilities that can be used on the battlefield. \n\nOh, and one more thing: we want to put the PUNCH back into BattleTech. This game will include MELEE COMBAT and DEATH FROM ABOVE!\n\n>>> STAGE 1+ ADDITIONAL FUNDING GOALS (FUNDED!)\n$250,000 - Combined Arms: We'll add a healthy roster of non-'Mech AI opponents to the Base Skirmish Game including tanks, hovercraft, support vehicles and more. But be careful - even the lightest of combat vehicles can still wreck your 'Mechs under the right conditions. \n$400,000 - Expanded Mission Objectives: We'll add a variety of mission types to the Base Skirmish Game including Escort, Capture, Defend, and more. \n$500,000 - Expanded Environments: We'll add a wider variety of battlefield environments to the game, including time-of-day and atmospheric conditions that affect both movement and combat. Confront enemy forces in the low-visibility conditions of a blizzard on a frigid ice world, or carefully manage your heat in a battle across volcanic fields.\nThe BattleTech Universe is all about stories - of nobles and MechWarriors, fighting to protect their people and their homes. Of mercenaries, surviving from battle to battle in a war-torn universe. It\u2019s a dynamic science fiction setting filled with intrigue and cutthroat politics that spans centuries. It\u2019s a shared universe that has evolved over 30 years, in tabletop miniatures games and sourcebooks, novels, comics, and dozens of computer games. We want to honor that history and make this perennial game setting come to life with a killer single-player story campaign.\nOur STAGE 2 STORY CAMPAIGN will put you in command of your own mercenary outfit, as you find yourself inexorably drawn into a bloody dynastic conflict set in the Periphery of the Inner Sphere. Over the course of the campaign, you\u2019ll manage the finances and logistics of your mercenary outfit - from the modifications and loadout of your 'Mechs, to the salaries and skill growth of your MechWarriors.\n\nA mercenary Lance of MechWarriors prepares for battle.\nAt the end of the day, the life of a mercenary is all about money: the money needed to repair the damage your 'Mechs took in combat, to pay your MechWarriors to keep fighting, and - if you\u2019re lucky - the money to put towards buying new 'Mech chassis and weapon systems. Fortunately, 'Mech components salvaged from the battlefield can be both cheaper and better-performing than the oft-refurbished parts available for purchase.\n\n>>> STAGE 2+ ADDITIONAL FUNDING GOALS (FUNDED!)\n$1,100,000 - Cinematic Transitions: We'll add short cutscenes for various events in game - such as deploying your forces to the battlefield - and for key moments in the single-player story.\n$1,200,000 - Player-Character Origin Stories: In BATTLETECH, you\u2019ll create your own mercenary character to star in the story. If we hit this funding level, you'll be able to choose one of six origin stories for your mercenary commander's career. Are you the only heir of a once noble family that has since fallen from favor? The bastard child of a famous MechWarrior? You decide.\n$1,350,000 - Voice Acting: We'll record a cast of talented voice actors to act as your advisers, provide mission briefings, and record battlefield emotes. We\u2019ll also add voice acting to the animatics for important moments in the story.\n$1,550,000 - 3D MechWarrior Portrait Customization: We'll build a complete 3D portrait customization system for you to customize the look of both your MechWarriors and your own Mercenary commander.\nThe STAGE 3 EXPANDED MERCENARY CAMPAIGN puts you in full control of your life as a Mercenary. The campaign becomes open-ended, allowing you to charter JumpShip transport for your mercenary outfit when needed - travel to various hot-zones across the Periphery and Inner Sphere. You\u2019ll be able to choose your contracts and alliances, with both the Great Houses and other subfactions within the Inner Sphere.\nThe emblems of the five Great Houses of the Inner Sphere.\nOver time, the missions you choose to accept and the objectives competed in those missions will determine your reputation as a mercenary. Your reputation will affect the contracts and contract terms you may be offered in the future. But be wary: each Great House - and in some cases, each House representative - can have their own agendas, sometimes leading you into bad deals or deadly betrayals.\nTheir negotiations complete, a Davion liaison officer briefs a merc outfit on their mission.\nTo support this open-ended Mercenary career, STAGE 3 adds a wide variety of \u201cside-contracts\u201d in addition to the story campaign, as well as a procedural contract-generation system to ensure that you always have fresh contracts available, wherever your Mercenary career may take you.\n>>> STAGE 3+ ADDITIONAL FUNDING GOALS (FUNDED!)\n$2,000,000 - Customizable Home Base: As part of the ongoing campaign, you'll acquire a home base (likely in the form of a derelict DropShip) for your mercenary outfit to call home. At this funding level we'll also allow you to adjust its appearance, repair and upgrade its functionality, and grow and evolve your base as your outfit grows and evolves.\n$2,150,000 - Legendary 'Mech & MechWarriors: In addition to the game's standard 'Mechs and customizable, procedurally-generated MechWarriors, we'll include rare legendary 'Mechs to find, and rare hero MechWarriors to hire - including some famous characters from BattleTech history. Such legends may not stick around for long, but will be well worth hiring if you can afford them.\nThe neutral planet of Solaris VII is home to the Inner Sphere\u2019s most famous gladiatorial 'Mech combat arenas. Here players can challenge each other to casual PvP battles or enter our matchmaking system to be matched against an appropriately experienced opponent. \nEach Great House maintains an embassy and a namesake arena on Solaris VII and each has very different gameplay features - from the Roman-inspired Steiner Coliseum to the frozen glaciers of Davion\u2019s Boreal Reach (or one of Davion\u2019s many other holographic environs).\nTournaments and Leagues will reward the victor with various prizes and Leaderboard fame.\nJon Everist, composer for the award-winning Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut and Shadowrun: Hong Kong, is creating the music for BATTLETECH. We\u2019re very excited to continue our collaboration with Jon and you can hear his first BattleTech tune in our Kickstarter video!\nInstead of throwing a bunch of random tchotchkes into this campaign, we've focused our physical reward efforts on two really awesome reward levels that we know we can deliver (in addition to all the great digital rewards we've created.) This focus will allow us to devote more of your funding towards making the best BattleTech game we can!\nClick the image to see all 6 Great House sets!\n                                     Click for larger Flight Jacket image.\nTo encourage everyone to get involved and share their passion for the BattleTech Universe, we've created a set of missions for you to collectively complete, listed below. Each mission accomplished by the Global BattleTech Community (GBC) earns a point. Earned points unlock cool content in the game and fun rewards for Backers (also listed below). \nNote: For more details about the Final Week Bonus Missions, see this Kickstarter Update!\nPosts to share & pages to Like/Follow:\nAnnouncement post on Facebook\nAnnouncement post on Twitter\nHBS on Facebook\nHBS on Twitter", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe know there are BattleTech fans that have been burned by other crowdfunding projects, and we\u2019re really sorry you had to go through that.\n\nHarebrained Schemes has delivered solid Kickstarter projects three times.

During the campaign, backers have been voting on content for 12 cards to include in the game.

Your choices are not easy, and there is more strategy than I would expect from this style of game.\" (link)\nWorld's Fair 1893 is an area majority and set collection game for 2-4 players that plays in about 40 minutes. On your turn, you send a supporter to one of the fives areas and collect all the cards next to it. Choose carefully to collect the cards you need and also beat out your opponents for control in the various areas:\nMain Exhibits - Influential Figures - Midway Tickets\nThe main exhibit cards could earn you the most points, but only if you have the supporters you need in the matching area to get the exhibits approved into the fair.\nFavors from the influential figure cards will increase your supporters in the areas and help you approve the exhibits you've already collected.\nThe Midway ticket cards for the fun and profitable attractions score you a small number of points and move the game forward.\nYou can download and read a draft version of the full rulebook:\nIf you want to play World's Fair 1893 to see if it's a good fit for you, you can use our print-and-play (PnP) files to make a prototype.

He lives in Dallas, Texas with his wife and two young sons. He works as a web developer at a software company in his day job, and he will be handing the official communication for this campaign.\n\u2014 About the Artists \u2014\nBeth Sobel is an illustrator from Bellingham, Washington with an MFA in Painting from Savannah College of Art and Design. She illustrated our game Lanterns: The Harvest Festival, as well games from Stonemaier Games, AEG, Fantasy Flight, and more. In her spare time, she enjoys hiking, reading, and a weekly board game group.\nAdam McIver, owner of The Cre8tive Dept, works full-time as an artist and graphic designer in the gaming industry. His work can be seen in games from Crash Games, Dice Hate Me Games, Green Couch Games, and more. He lives in Cincinnati.\n\u2014 ORGANIZER \u2014\nFor the ORGANIZER pledge level, we contribute $8 towards shipping costs for all backers.

For any number more than one copy of the game, you should use the DOUBLE ORGANIZER pledge level. The pledge amount will be automatically calculated for two copies, but you can pledge an additional amount for additional copies. Here is a chart showing the total pledge for multiple copies:\nFoxtrot Games would not exist without the amazing support and enthusiasm from our Kickstarter backers. It has been so rewarding to have so many of you join us to publish this game, Relic Expedition, and Lanterns, to interact with you on BoardGameGeek and Twitter, and to meet some of you in person at conventions and at game stores.\nAndrew Brooks, Lanterns backer \u2014 \u201cTo me, the ideal of what Kickstarter can achieve is a community of people supporting a vision they believe in and want to become a reality. Being a part of the Lanterns campaign and seeing the joy it brought to many (including the creators) proved to me that this ideal is still possible.\u201d\nThe Fisherman - Electric Fountains - Windmills\nThis project contains a number of items that might typically be added only as \"stretch goals.\" However, we are including these all right from the start: to reduce the risk of new artwork delays, to give you the best value we can, to thank you for backing early and for joining us for the full campaign experience, and to show you how much we believe in this game: \nUpgraded cards (310 gsm, linen finish)\nMore variety in Transportation card art (7 new illustrations)\nMore variety in Manufacturing card art (7 new illustrations)\nMore variety in Agriculture card art (7 new illustrations)\nMore variety in Fine Arts card art (7 new illustrations)\nMore variety in Electricity card art (7 new illustrations) \nMore variety in Midway card art (27 new illustrations)\nWooden Ferris wheel car marker (custom)\nFerris Wheel Car Photo \u2014 Ferris Wheel Car Marker\nWe are fortunate that our previous game Lanterns: The Harvest Festival did well on Kickstarter and has continued to sell well since.

The SECOND best thing you can do to help Darkrock Ventures is to spread the word on your Social Media sites! Here are some fun social media avatars you can use to help express your fandom! Collect them all!\nThe more Followers and Likes we can accumulate means the more people know about our projects, which equals more awesome content in every game! THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!\nAll rewards for this project will be shipped from the USA.\nDelivering Your Reward Responsibly\nOur number one goal and responsibility is to deliver the rewards that our backers pledge for. Gamelyn Games brings years of experience to this project and has overseen all of our planning and arrangements to ensure Darkrock Ventures will be delivered to all backers in a timely manner just like all of their previous projects.\nEvery backer is important to us, regardless of location, just as much every pledge makes a difference, regardless of amount. Unfortunately shipping costs are something we all have to face, but that does not mean we cannot be transparent about this challenge and tackle it responsibly. The learning experiences Gamelyn Games has overcome with shipping have come to this campaign in full, and we aim to manage our (and your) risk in a responsible and professional manner.\nShipping costs are a very real factor. They can be volatile and are never trivial. Further, I do not feel that claiming to offer \"Free Shipping\" only to hide that very real & significant cost somewhere else is the best way of doing things and our backers deserve better. We have decided to offer affordable FLAT-RATE shipping to various regions, but at the same time offer CUSTOMS-FRIENDLY shipping available to ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD through our friends at Ship Naked to offer the best overall value we can for your pledge.\nWe will always endeavor to keep shipping charges as low as possible by offering discounts on pledges for more than one copy at a time through campaign rewards and add-ons made available through Pledge Manager. The best way to get the game for the lowest cost possible is to split a multi-pack with some friends or family members, everyone can share the cost benefit and more copies ordered means Darkrock Ventures itself will become a better game.\nRegarding Customs: Our shipping partner, Ship Naked, offers what they call \"Customs-Friendly Worldwide Shipping\" meaning they coordinate all transport, customs clearance, and brokerage from the factory to the destination using shipping depots all around the world. They have already laid the groundwork to ensure all packages will make it to backers in every country as smoothly and inexpensively as possible. While we cannot personally guarantee that no single person will have any customs difficulties on an individual level, we are confident in Ship Naked's ability to mitigate any potential issues and keep surprise costs far away from our backers and their ability to make it right should any such problems arise. Historically, Gamelyn Games has had very few individual cases of customs difficulties and the processes have improved even more since those challenges have occurred. Pledge with Confidence!\nInternational Backers Please Keep in Mind: While the shipping costs outside the USA are greater, every base copy of the game will be sold $11 below MSRP through this campaign, with discounts even greater when multiple copies are ordered.

It is prone to many mistakes and that does not exclude experienced publishers.\n\nWe at Magic Meeple Games are new to publishing, but not to the industry; and with Gamelyn games are our publishing partner, we're proud to say that we are prepared for the task at hand and have years of experience in our corner with successful fulfillment of board game projects.\n\nHere are the steps we are taking to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the art for the game completed and the graphic design over 75% completed. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated. All we need now is your pledges to make it happen!\n\n2. We are proud to be working with Panda Game Manufacturing again, the same manufacturer Gamelyn Games has used to create all of their previous projects. Gamelyn Games and Magic Meeple Games both have a great relationship with their team, we are very familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements. Together, we have created some great games and products and we hope that Darkrock Ventures will be our next!\n\n3. Professional distribution is already in place, and we are proud to say it will be handled by Ship Naked. They have been responsible for the fulfillment of previous Gamelyn Games titles. All of which were delivered on schedule reliably and professionally. Ship Naked has proven to be communicative, punctual and customer service minded when dealing with Gamelyn Games' customers and they have extended the same level of service and expertise to Magic Meeple Games' publications as well. \n\nAgain, this isn't to say that this project is immune to the possible mishap, they can happen to anyone but we want to show that this road is familiar to all parties involved and we are confident in our ability to deliver our products to our backers and fans. Thank you for your confidence and support!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbove all, We are 100% dedicated to backer communication. We will be transparent with our process, and involve our backers as much as possible. \n\nWe will be present daily during the project to answer any questions or read any comments and we will provide regular updates and supply photos of the progress when possible.\n\nThank you for your trust in us! We couldn't do it without you! Let's bring Darkrock Ventures to the gaming world!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTiny Epic Kingdoms: Heroes Call just finished its campaign, but with Magic Meeple Games on the case, TEK:HC will cause no delays or have any negative impact whatsoever on the production and fulfillment of Darkrock Ventures.

Designed to be the perfect palate cleanser for groups to enjoy between larger games, and a staple of family game night, Cast & Capture is a great addition to your gaming collection.\n\"Cast and Capture is a really simple game that does what it is supposed to do very, very well. It is absolutely worth $20.\" - Daniel Zayas, The Meeple Mechanic.\n\"This game has cast a spell on me with its charming play and captured a permanent spot in my gaming bag\" - Maurice Fitzgerald, Board Game Reviewer for Club Fantasci.\n\"Non-gamers, casual players, and more enthusiastic Parent Geek gamers all enjoyed the game both with their peers and with their families... I would recommend Cast & Capture to Child Geeks and Parent Geeks, to casual players and non-gamers.\" - Cyrus Kirby, Editor-in-Chief, Father Geek.\n See more reviews and videos below!\nDuring gameplay, each player receives spells that they use to collect creatures on the field. Each turn, a player must make a capture using one of these spells, or they are forced to place a spell in a community pool. In order to capture a creature, an exact match must be made using the power and element of the spell.\nUsing the pool, players may also alter the power or element of the spells in their hand to create new spells and improve their chances to make a capture. Mages may also group creatures together, creating a new element and power combination. As the number of mixing and matching options increase, each player must be vigilant and clever if they want to find the best move each turn.\nCast & Capture It is easy to teach and quick to play, but full of deep gameplay moments. It is a game that appeals to a large audience while still holding a subtle complexity that will keep seasoned gamers coming back.

We wanted to make getting the game as easy as possible for everyone, so we have decided to absorb the first $5 of shipping for all backers, regardless of level or location.  Because of this, we are able to offer all US backers free shipping, and a reduced shipping level for everyone else worldwide.\n* All shipping rates need to be doubled for the Traveling Merchant level. Also, shipping is free worldwide for backers at the Master Namer level. However, all international Backers will be responsible for any import fees, brokerage or delivery surcharges, or applicable taxes that may be levied after the package is shipped. That said, the low price point and small box for this game make it customs friendly and should not cause any customs fees for backers pledging for 1-2 copies.\nChelsea Flores is a young artist from Houston, Texas who is aiming to make her mark as an illustrator.

Manufacturing and distribution will be a new task for Randover Games, as none of us have prior experience in that field. However, we have been doing our research and listening to the wonderful advice of far more experienced individuals and companies, and we can confidently say it is something we are capable of achieving. \n\nIn light of this, the primary risk we would like to emphasize is the possibility of delays to our manufacturing and shipping schedules. We have taken careful steps to minimize this risk, including overestimating all of our timings and solidifying professional relationships far in advance of this campaign, but there is always the possibility of the unexpected.\n\nThe one promise we make regarding all of this is that we will be in constant contact with our backers and easy to reach should any questions arise.

Grab a backpack, a sandwich, that monster you call a sibling, and head out into the wilderness, leaving the comfort of home at your back.\nThe objective of The Siblings Trouble is to cooperatively play through a pocket-sized adventure with your friends or family. During your adventure you\u2019ll explore a mysterious place (the Hillside Cave, the Ancient Forest, etc.) and have a series of narrative moments that lead to the final encounter and Epic Treasure. Survive them all and the memories and treasures of your experience will be yours; fail and get sent home. If all players are sent home, the game is over... no more fun, just an early dinner, bath, and straight to bed.\nThe Siblings Trouble boils down the core elements of an RPG (storytelling, exploration, discovery, treasure, encounters, etc.) into a fun-to-play narrative romp. This is a 30 minute game you can play as an ice-breaker, in-betweener, or as a way to introduce storytelling and adventure games to new players. This is not trying to make a simplified, beginner version of Dungeons & Dragons. It is an experience unto itself which leverages the fun of pen and paper games and lets players have quick, enjoyable adventures together. Rather than high-fantasy, TST is influenced by Miyasaki, The Goonies, The Hardy Boys, Stand by Me and even Pikmin. \nTo learn how to play The Siblings Trouble, you can download the instructions or watch the How to Play video below.\nHow to Play Video\n .\nBeing selected as one of eight games to be included in the PAX South Indie Showcase was an incredible honor.

Getting to spend time with the Tabletop Deathmatch team, judges, and the seven other teams was an incredible experience.\nSince Gen-Con 2014, we\u2019ve made some specific improvements to the game in response to this feedback.\nCard / Presentation Clean Up\nCards were hard to read and needed clean up. They are much improved. We also had great feedback on making each card spectacular. We embraced this and every card was refined.\nEvery turn ends with something\nAnother change we made was to ensure that every turn, no matter what card or roll occurs, the player adds something interesting to the story.\nBig Secret / Fear Counters / Adventure Deck structure\nThe biggest single piece of feedback we received was that our game experience felt flat and didn't offer enough sense of progress and climax. We took this to heart, thought a lot, and designed the Big Secret / Fear Counter system.\nNow a third of the way into the game, one of the players reveals a huge secret that casts a shadow over the adventure. They also reveal the Boss and the Epic Treasure at the end of the game.  From this point on, cards can add or take away Fear Counters from the Boss which makes it fiercer and harder to overcome. This system creates fantastic story moments, a nice narrative arc, and a satisfying conclusion.\n Keep up on The Siblings Trouble\n- Follow The Siblings Trouble on Facebook\n- Follow Me (@ebaraf) on Twitter\nBoard Game Aggregators\n- The Siblings Trouble on BoardGameGeek.com\n- The Siblings Trouble on BoardGaming.com\nBlogs and Podcasts\n- COG Gaming: TST Preview\n- Paste Magazine: 5 Board Games We Wanted from PAX South\n- The Inquisitive Meeple: Designer Interview\n- The Geeky Gimp: Designer Interview\n- The Purple Pawn: Kickstarter Roundup\n- Casual Game Revolution: Crowdfunding Roundup\n- Rollin' Dice: Top 3 Kickstarters in April\n- The Meeple Mechanic: Top Spot on Kickstarter Badger\n- WDYPTW Podcast Thing: Week 22\n- Club Fantasci: Kickstarter of the Week\n- Troll In the Corner: Kick The Box - April\n- The Nerd's Table: The Siblings Trouble Review\n- Back it! on DFW Nerd Night: Ed Interview\n- Docking Bay 94: The Siblings Trouble Podcast\n- League of Gamemakers: Distributed Design\n- The Game Wire: Interview with Ed Baraf\n- BGG Design Blog: Blog by Andy Ashcraft\n- The Inquisitive Meeple: The Meeple Report\n- Altema Games: Blog by Kim Robinson\n- Board Game Jungle: The Siblings Trouble Review\n- Life in Games: The Siblings Trouble Review\n- Chalkboard Game Reviews Talking Games: Ed Interview\nThe Siblings Trouble is possible because people believe, support, and lift each other up.

Get Me Off This Planet! was my first. I learned a ton with Lift Off!, hit some bumps, but went out of my way to inform and engage my backers. \n\nThe Siblings Trouble is well tested and balanced. The graphic design is complete pending a few cleanup tasks and 80% of the card art is final. We are already in preparation for print (box, instructions, etc.) and we have been working closely with our printer.\n\nThere are inherent risks whenever undertaking a project as complex and large as producing and distributing a board game, but I have been making complex projects with countless moving parts and large budgets most of my career. I've gone out of my way to surround myself with experienced board game developers, distributors, and people who have run and launched successful Kickstarters. This team of friends has been exceedingly supportive and I'm sure will help as we hit any upcoming bumps in the road. And there are bumps. Strikes, shortages, shipping delays are all hard to predict.\n\nMost importantly, if something does go wrong, I will keep everyone in the loop as the project moves forward and comes to market. This game will exist because you all will have made it happen.

Boss Monster 2: The Next Level will be available in June 2015 at friendly local game stores and the official Brotherwise Games online store.\nBoss Monster is coming back to the tabletop, and this time we're taking it to The Next Level!\nBoss Monster 2: The Next Level is a full-sized, 160 card set that returns you to the world of Arcadia where the bad are good and the good are dinner. Just like the original Boss Monster, you'll take the role of the boss at the end of a retro-style video game dungeon, competing against other bosses to build a dungeon that will lure in questing heroes and destroy them. You can play Boss Monster 2 on its own, or combine the set with the original Boss Monster cards for a truly epic experience! \nThe original Boss Monster was a Kickstarter hit, before going on to become a bestseller in hobby and game stores worldwide. The retail pre-orders for Boss Monster 2 are already rolling in, but this Kickstarter gives the community that made Boss Monster happen a chance to get in on the action early, and get some special extras before anyone else.\nWhat's New?\nBoss Monster 2 is an all-new set with more Bosses, more card variety, and more ways to crush puny Heroes! Here are just a few of the things that make it our favorite Boss Monster experience yet:\nDark Heroes -- the Hitman, Barbarian, Witch, and Vampire -- can be \"paid\" to deal more damage to an opponent.\nHybrid Heroes -- the Swordmage, Druid, Archer and Necromancer -- are drawn to two treasure types and feature powerful abilities.\nEpic Spells -- like Lightning Bolt! and It's On! -- give you the option to unlock more powerful effects if you meet a prerequisite.\nMore cross-table effects, like \"cycling\" Rooms that let you discard cards to affect an opponent's dungeon.\nMore access to Spells, through Cleric Rooms as well as Mage Rooms.\n...and more! Boss Monster 2 features more overall variety and fewer duplicate cards, to keep the game fresh after dozens of plays.\nIf you're an experienced dungeon-builder, Boss Monster gives you all-new tools and more ways to interact with your opponents. But if this is your first time playing Boss Monster, it retains the accessibility and ease of play that made the original a hit.\nThe Rewards\nTHE GAME: For $25 you get the full retail copy of Boss Monster: The Next Level, featuring 160 cards (with 12 all new bosses!) and hours of fun for 2-4 players. Boss Monster is a standalone expansion, which means you can play it on its own, shuffle the Room and Spell cards together with your original set, or mix and match to create your ideal Boss Monster experience!\nThe game includes everything you see here, printed by Cartamundi USA. If you live in the United States, shipping is included in the price! International shipping is $8 extra to Canada and $15 extra for the rest of the world.\n THE LIMITED EDITION: Pledge $32 and you get the Limited Edition version of the game. You'll get everything in the base game plus a box sleeve with art by game industry artist Darren Calvert. You'll also get holofoil cards of the 12 bosses. We are only doing one printing of these extras! Any Limited Edition versions that aren't bought up here will be made available later this year to your friendly local game store, but we can't promise how many will be left. If you live in the U.S., shipping is included in the price. International shipping is $8 extra to Canada and $15 extra for the rest of the world.\nTHE COLLECTOR BOX: At $55 you'll get everything available in the Limited Edition pledge level plus our new Collector Box, a deluxe carrying case that's big enough to hold over 400 sleeved cards! The Collector Box is styled like a retro lunchbox, with durable corrugate construction by Legion Supplies. It also comes with a set of all-new cards that take Boss Monster into the world of retro portable gaming! (Thanks to our stretch goals, this pack will now contain 9 cards!) Portable cards can be \"moved\" every turn, giving your dungeon unprecedented flexibility.\nWhile Boss Monster 2 and the Limited Edition version will ship in May; the rest of the rewards from this level won't ship until later in the year. Free shipping in the U.S. International shipping is $16 extra to Canada and $30 extra for the rest of the world.\nStretch Goals\nWe have some very fun stretch goals planned for the campaign. Our first two stretch goals add more cards to the Limited Edition and Collector Box pledge levels.\n$50,000: UNLOCKED! Our first stretch goal added two holofoil cards to the Limited Edition! The first is an alternate art version of The Brothers, a 20-Health Hero who heads to the dungeon of whoever's winning. Even better, we'll include Mirrax, a new Boss card that \"reflects\" an opponent's treasure... a critical advantage in the race for Heroes!\n$100,000: UNLOCKED! Now that we've reached $100K, we will invest more into the Portable Pack that comes with the Collector Box. Getting doubles of every Room card will ensure these new \"portable\" Room cards have an even bigger impact on your game!\n$150,000: UNLOCKED! To celebrate breaking through $150K, we're offering Boss Monster fans the chance to truly make the game their own. We'll partner with custom card creators DriveThruCards to create a tool players can use to create, customize, and print their own cards to use in their own Boss Monster game nights.\n$215,000: UNLOCKED! This campaign has now eclipsed our original Kickstarter. To celebrate that epic accomplishment, we'll design five all-new Epic Spells and mail them to backers at all three pledge tiers!\n$250,000: UNLOCKED! We're giving the Collector Box a Kickstarter-exclusive enhancement -- four Level Up Tokens. Inspired by classic arcade tokens, these coins use the same design as the tokens in our original Kickstarter campaign, but cast in metallic silver. The tokens make a fun collector's item and a useful gameplay accessory.\n$300,000: UNLOCKED! Our final stretch goal is another reward for backers at all pledge tiers -- five new Item cards. These special cards will ship with the Epic Spells.

Continuously in print for more than a thousand years, the game has seen thousands of expansions and billions of cards.\nPlayers from around the world seek to become world champions by mastering duels and collecting the game\u2019s rarest and most coveted cards. Still others live by the game, building financial empires by dealing, speculating, and trading in the aftermarket. Many are content simply to play for fun and meet new friends.\nYour very own Millennium Blades Legend is about to unfold! What will be your path to glory? With your starter deck in hand and a dream in your heart, the time has come to step boldly into the world of Millennium Blades!\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nMillennium Blades is a board game about a fictional collectible card game, which is also called Millennium Blades. You begin the game on pre-release night with just your starter deck. You\u2019ll open new packs, form collections, and sell your junk cards on the aftermarket to buy hot new cards. Trade with your friends, build up your deck, and prepare to compete at Millennium Blades Worlds for the title of World Champion!\nWe\u2019ve all been touched by the magic of Collectible Card Games\u2014from the thrill of opening packs and discovering that ultra-rare card, to the excitement of waiting on pre-release night to see what hidden gems a new set holds, to the tension of sitting with baited breath to see your opponent\u2019s play in the final round of the tournament. Millennium Blades captures that magic and distills it down to a single-game session.\nCard Games create their own world and their own culture for us to explore, and continue to reward players who delve deeper and deeper into these worlds. These games are about discovery, social interaction, and fun\u2013what could be a better topic to use as the basis for a board game!?\nNow, after 2 years of continuous development, spanning over 20 major revisions, we're finally ready to bring Millennium Blades to life!\nGet hyped for Millennium Blades on Board Game Geek!\n\"...a hell of a lot of fun... I\u2019ve never played anything quite like it.\"\n          - Dan Thurot, Space Biff\n\"Playing Millennium Blades was like drinking purely distilled nostalgia... It stands as a truly unique gaming experience unlike anything else I have played to date.\"\n          - EphFive, Scrappy Review\n\"Millennium Blades is a game like no other... it perfectly encapsulates the Collectible Card Game experience - from opening packs for chase rares; to buying, selling and trading for cards on the secondary market; and building and refining decks to suit the current metagame. Millenium Blades offers a lot of depth... you are constantly engaged, with very little downtime.\"  \n          - Sean Ramirez, The Dukes of Dice Podcast\n\"I've played it with my gaming group, and my bizarro gaming group.

You get a limited pool of cards, and then you tinker them into the most unfairly over-powered, table-flippingly broken deck that you can imagine. And your deck had better be pretty crazy, because your opponents won\u2019t be giving any quarter, and they all have unique collections with access to their own high-tier power cards.\nIn addition to deckbuilding, you'll be speculating on blind pack buys, selling and buying cards on the aftermarket, and fusing your cards to make rarer and better ones to get an advantage over the competition. You might even make a few friends, if you're willing to help them out.\nMillennium Blades is a large-scale game that takes around 2 hours to play (depending on the number of players and their familiarity with the game). Between 2 and 5 players can participate. The intensity level of this game is fairly high, and you\u2019ll need to use all your gaming skills to make it to the top.\nThere's not really anything else in gaming that's comparable to the full scope of Millennium Blades. It's part Galaxy Trucker, part Ascension, and part Race for the Galaxy. The best thing to do is to watch this quick overview video if you want to understand it all!\nWill you try to build the Ultimate Deck and sweep the tournament scene? Will you become the most accomplished collector in the world? Will you make stacks of money in the Aftermarket and in trades, or will you help your friends along the path to glory? There's nothing quite like beating that smug tournament player with the power of friendship, haggling to get that last card you desperately need for your deck, or drawing that one, legendary power card from a random, unexpected pack.\nEvery game of Millennium Blades offers new and unexpected twists, turns, and possibilities!\nDOWNLOAD THE RULEBOOK (work-in-progress): Learn more about gameplay by checking out a preview of the game's rulebook!\nThere are two parts to Millennium Blades \u2014 Tournaments and Deckbuilding. These will be repeated over several rounds. The player who can acquire the most Victory Points by the end of the third Tournament is the winner!\nIn the Deckbuilding Phase, you will buy cards and freely construct your deck in a limited time frame.

There are many paths to these points, however...\nWinning Tournaments is the largest source of Victory Points\nCompleting valuable Collections is another way to get big points.\nThe Money you've made in the Aftermarket will score points.\nFriendship that you've earned from helping the other players will earn you some points as well.\nThe 500+ cards in Millennium Blades are organized into a number of sets, which all come in the same core box. Each set contains 12 cards, and has a different theme, mechanics, and aesthetics. In a game, you will select and use 12 different card sets. Each possible combination of sets will open the door to new combos and interactions! \nAll these sets are included in the base game box!\nThe Game Box (a huge 17.25\"x11.25\"x2.75\" box) includes these materials:\nAround 500 Game Cards (depending on stretch goals) \n5 Player Mats(17\"x8.5\" heavy cardstock) \n2 Central Game Mats (17\"x11\" heavy cardstock) \nA tough Storage Tray to store the base game and any future expansions.\nMillennium Blades: Set Rotation\nThrough stretch goals, we've unlocked the option to add-on an expansion that will ship out at the same time as the base game, called Millennium Blades: Set Rotation. Set Rotation includes 12 new card sets, giving you half again as much content as the base game, opening up even more variety. Set Rotation is designed with advanced gamers in mind, and gives you additional depth and strategy for experiencing Millennium Blades.\nTo add-on Set Rotation, just upgrade your pledge to the Power Gamer Tier.

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMillennium Blades is one of the largest and most fully-featured games we have ever produced. With over 200 pieces of full-color artwork and two years of intensive game design and development, we've already taken on significant risk to make this game a reality.\nThe production and delivery of physical goods is a messy and complex process, and it's impossible to fully gauge the challenges each project will present. However, we've managed to successfully deliver six Kickstarter-produced board games in the past, so we feel confident that we're prepared to face whatever challenges might come up.\nWe like to outdo ourselves and make each game a spectacular production, and so we have been known to delay games to make sure that everything is up to our high standards of quality and playability. Please be aware that our delivery dates are very rough estimates only, and are subject to change.\nWhile we work our best to get your games to you in a timely manner and a reasonable price, please be aware that overseas (especially in Europe and Canada) the hobby distribution chain works faster and cheaper than we can offer through Kickstarter. If you are outside of the USA and think that you will be able to get the project rewards from your local game store or regional online store, we recommend pledging for just the promotional cards and supporting your local hobby industry by getting the final game through them.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #89", "update_userinfo": "Millennium Blades Collusion is Live & Funded!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #88", "update_userinfo": "Collusion is coming to Kickstarter on Friday!", "update_content": "Greetings fellow duelists!\nI'm excited to announce a new chapter in the Millennium Blades saga!

Especially our favourite ones. One of the components that are most used in games are their currency.\n\nBy upgrading the components you most use of, you immediately upgrade the games' looks a lot! You can use our metal coins in all kinds of gaming, either tabletop, RPGs LARP, whatever you prefer.\n And for that purpose, here we are, to help you make your favorite games look better than ever. With this campaign we offer you the opportunity to get you these amazing metal coins to make your favorite games shine!\nChoose from our huge variety of 11 unique sets, covering different flavors, to make sure YOUR favorite game can use one of these.\n Each contains different designs, in gold, silver and copper plated metal, and of course, each design with have a different \"heads\" and \"tails\" side to be more realistic.\n\nAlso, in each set a free velvet (100% cotton) pouch is added for free. You can choose from a selection of these 5 lovely colors:\nWe wanted to make a lot of different kinds so you can choose your favorites, so we introduce you to these Metal Sets:\nFor all your fantasy games you want to give an elven look. I can cerainly see them used as coins in many LoTR games.\nFor games set in the Asia, such as Yspahan, or Camel Up\n One of our favorites. I would certainly use them in dwarven-themed games like Caverna, Terra Mystica or any other fantasy game.\n This is our more royal set, the one a king would love to have on his region, or a player on his Caylus or Game of Thrones.\nYou can't make anything Legendary without a Dragon. And this set would be much less legendary without this Dragon set. You can easilly use them in asy fantasy game or in DnD\n A collection for games set in Asia, or else Far East. Can be used in games such as Takenoko, In the Year of the Dragon and much more.\nIt was time that these doublons got a level-up. This pirate theme will be great for games like Merchants and Marauders.\n One of our most unique sets. Coins so futuristic can certainly be used in Android:Netrunner or any games set in the future.\n A Steampunk coin set for games like Steam Park or Mission:Red Planet. Let's shine these gears!\nWe couldn't resist making something from our own history. You can use these goodies in games such as Cyclades or Colloseum.\nIn the dark medieval times, currency was more functional than pretty. We really tried to keep them simple, but sometimes inspiration cannot wait.\n Orc Coins Unlocked:  The most battered of all! For your Warhammer and other fantasy games! We could not resists another fantasy coin set,\n Wild West Coins unlocked: To live the Wild West the proper way thorugh games such us Carson City or Shadows of Brimstone.\nThe material used in all coins is Zinc alloy, and the sizes vary from 2.7 to 3.2 mm thick, while the diameter is from 2.9cm to 3.5cm wide.\nYes, that means they are pretty massive.\n\nBut, don't take only our word for these. Check out what all these guys think about them in these video presentations:\n Update: New video review from Undead Viking and Geek-Craft!\n\nAlso, here you can read a review from Rob from GeekDad.\n\n\nAnd here is an image of  the coins of the Dwarven Set and the Greek Set. Can you spot that little on the corner? That is a USD quarter (so you can have a reference for their size). Also, you can see the comparison of the thickness of the coins (both our larger sets like the Dwarven ones and the smaller like the Greek).\n\nBoth Images were created from ConnectMoreBoardGames. Many thanks David .\n\nAnd this is an image demonstrating the different diameters in each Set.\n\n\nFree International Shipping\nWe knew from day 1 that we started the project that most backers would be afraid of a big cost through shipping (especially since our coins are that massive).But you don't have to worry about it at all. As we decided, shipping will be absolutely free for all backers anywhere in the world.\nAnd since we are talking about delivery, we are going to start production immediately after the campaign is over, since the only thing missing to start is funding. That means that you are all going to receive your coins by July (or even sooner than that).\n\nAlso, our project is EU friendly, so none of our European friends has to worry about customs.\n \nYou want some of these cool coins for you? Choose the rewards that fits you best:\n  Single Set Pledge This is the simplest you can get. Choose one of the 11 sets and get 24 coins of that set.\n Of course, in some games you will need even more coins, or maybe less but don't worry, we've got you covered. You can add more coins, of whatever design you prefer, with 1$ each after you purchuased one of the single sets. Also, you can pick up Two or More Sets, either with the same or different design. The more you add, the better discount you get.\n\nUpdate: After unlocking many Stretch Goals, each set now cointains 12 copper coins, 9 silver, 7 gold and we may unlock even more coins!\n \n  Collectors Set Pledge\nYou want them all, so you can have them all ! \nWith this pledge you can get one of every coin available from this campaign.\n- After popular demand, you can add a second (or more) Collectors Set, with $26 additionally ($55 for both).\n-You can also get both the Collectors Set and a Single Set (or more). In order to do so, select the \"Collectors Set\" reward and add to the value the addinional fee required for extra sets. (e.g. 1 Collectors Set and 1 Single Set for $48 [29+19] ).\nUpdate: After unlocking some Stretch Goals, now each Collectors Set includes the 3 coins from the Wild West set and the 3 coins of the Orc set!\nCustom Set pledge:\nLast but not least, the Custom Set Pledge.\nChoose any coins, in the desired quantity. You can take as many designs as you wish just by adding 1 extra USD for each coin after the 20 you get with your pledge. Of course, shipment is free and you get a free pouch for every 50 coins you select.\nAlso you get 1 extra coin for free for every 10 coins you purchase!\n\nUpdate: After unlocking some Stretch Goals you now get an extra free coin every 50.\n\nE.g. If you decide to give $70, you will get: 79 coins (70 plus 7 (one for each 10) plus 2(one per 50)), and 2 pouches.\n\nEg.2 If you give $40 you get : 45 coins (40 plus 4  plus 1) and 1 pouch.\nSame Set pledge:\nWith this pledge you can purchase multiples of the same coin, but you can use it as an add-on to your existing pledge (for example you can get a lot of copper coins as \u201cchange\u201d).\nThat means, than you can also select 50 coins for $40, 75 coins for $60 etc.\n*Important: Same Set pledge is not affected from extra coins Stretch Goals*\n\nAdd-Ons\nWooden Chest with metal parts! It can contain 40-50 coins.\n\nIn the two images you can see all the available add-ons you can purchase regardless of your original pledge.\n\nPlease remember that depending what was your original pledge, you can also add the following:\nIf you have purchased four or more single sets: you can add additional sets for $16.\n\nIf you have purchased a collectors set: -you can add additional collectors sets for $26.\n- you can add single sets with the normal rates (as seen in the pledge levels).\n\nFree Handmade Pouch to All Backers\nWe could not stand looking all these pretty pieces in a cheap ziplock bag. So, we searched long and hard to manufacture the best-looking way to hold these great coins. \nAll sets of coins will include a handmade velvet (100% cotton) pouch for free, just for this campaign.\n\nUpdate: After unlocking some Stretch Goals, now you get to choose the color of each of your pouches between these:\nAvailable colors: Dark Brown, Brown, Dark Red, Green, Purple\n \nDrawlab Entertainment: We are a boardgaming publishing company which also manufactures anything made of plastic or metal.

Take a look at how they react when hit or missed and all of the things that differentiate them from each other.\nThe Grey Lady may be shy, but she's not afraid to stop your roughhousing in its tracks. If this librarian has paid your scenario a visit, she won't go quietly! If you do manage to get her attention, she leaves you only with your thoughts, waiting to cramp your style in the next adventure! The Grey Lady will add a challenge to many scenarios, especially if playing more than one in a single session. \nSandman will include a custom scenario specifically designed for him.\nZombie Taxi Drivers are eager to take the Ecto-1 on a joy ride around town! Once one of them reaches your ride, he immobilizes it until you get rid of him, but not until he sends it speeding off, ghost rider style!\nThe Zombie Taxi Drivers will come with a scenario specifically designed for them. However, they can also be used as Class 1 replacements and companions in base game scenarios. \nNote: When differently named Ghosts share a Class, roll a d6 for each, with the higher roll making an appearance. Impossible Mode versions get +3 to this roll!\nPlayer Cards\nUp to 4 players take on the roles of the Ghostbusters and attempt to return balance between the Spirit World and ours, busting ghosts and sealing the gates from which they\u2019re invading. Completing a scenario requires teamwork, planning, and resourcefulness.  \nMelanie Ortiz keeps a watchful eye on her coworkers, and a closer eye on her targets. Her selfless acts bring her closer to knowing herself, and in turn, in how to deal with the approaching end game of the other worldly intruders.\nJanine\u2019s quick response time is her key attribute at the front desk and as a Ghostbuster! When she spots a newly summoned Ghost, she acts fast, and when she sees a fellow Ghostbuster in a tight situation, she leaps into action!\nKylie thinks things through, to the point where she anticipates what's coming! Her research into the forbidden arts has granted her insight into the dark intentions of her enemies, whose actions seem entirely random to everyone else.\nRon is always trying to prove he has the chops to be a better Ghostbuster, even if that means putting himself in danger. He's no schlub when it comes to tech and the closer he gets to a threat, the more brazen he becomes.\nPeter Venkman is a risk-taker who does his best work in close proximity to ghosts.\nIllustrated by Dan Schoening, sculpted by Samuel H. Greenwell\nRay Stantz excels at removing slime from his fellow Ghostbusters.\nIllustrated by Dan Schoening, sculpted by Samuel H. Greenwell\nEgon Spengler is a wild man with his proton pack, but learns from his mistakes.\nIllustrated by Dan Schoening, sculpted by Samuel H. Greenwell\nWinston Zeddemore aids the team by being the best at depositing trapped ghosts.\nIllustrated by Dan Schoening, sculpted by Samuel H. Greenwell\nFeatured ghosts from the movies, cartoons, comics, and toylines have unique abilities as well, in terms of how they move and react to your actions.\nThe game features 3 campaigns, each with 4 unique scenarios. It\u2019s a fast-paced game: each scenario takes approximately 30 intense minutes to play. Every campaign concludes with an epic battle against an iconic boss character.\nThe game uses dice to resolve a lot of the action, so it\u2019s never the same game twice! The three types of dice represent the proton packs and ghost traps, the unpredictable movements of the ghosts, and the chaotic activity of the gates. During each turn, players move, shoot proton streams, deposit trapped ghosts, use unique character abilities, and drive the Ecto-1 to complete objectives. \nEach scenario\u2019s map is constructed using double-sided tiles, featuring street and park imagery by the talented Robb Mommaerts. With a starter mode and a challenge mode, Ghostbusters: The Board Game will keep you enthralled for hours!\nHere is a link to a Rules Primer to give you a bit of insight into specific scenario gameplay!  https://bit.ly/1vGYVAl\nHere is an introductory video that goes through the basic elements of the game!\nPLAY\n\nThe video below features a full playthrough of one of our several introductory scenarios! \nAnd if that wasn\u2019t enough, here is Part 2 of the playthrough!\nTo create the best game possible, we\u2019ve collaborated with some incredible people: game designers, avid game players, and Ghostbusters fans.

The fifth and highest element in ancient and medieval philosophy that permeates all nature and is the substance composing the celestial bodies 2. The essence of a thing in its purest and most concentrated form \n      Quintessential is playable by two to five players in about 45 minutes. All players begin as elementary students of alchemy. Players draw from a common store of knowledge and share a laboratory, but it\u2019s up to each individual to determine how best to combine the elements that are available. Players use the element dice in their element pool in formulas either in their personal lab OR the community lab.  Each action requires a lab worker to be placed on the card being activated or claimed for use.  Once used, the element generated can be rolled or free placed on another formula card, potentially completing chain reactions and producing multiple elements at the same time.  \nAn example of heavy bidding in a round.\nA player may also use workers to bid on cards in the bottom row of the tableau.  A successful bid wins the card, and it is usable in the alchemist's personal lab during the next round.  An unsuccessful bid is not a waste, however, as this generates the unstable anti-element.  The anti-element is wild and can be used in any formula as a reactant, but is very volatile and will be destroyed after use.  Sometimes, this will generate even more chain reactions.  \nAs players build their element pools, they can use them to create Aether, the fifth element and the key to winning the game.  There are 2 community forges and each player has a personal forge that can create the fifth element.  The community forges can only be claimed once per round, so players must plan carefully and bid for the first player token when they need to gain the advantage. \nThe rules are pretty simple, but here is the rule book, current as of Feb 10, 2015.  The game has been in production for 4 years, and there are minor changes if you owned or played the original version.  We encourage you to download them right here.\nPRINT -N- PLAY!\nEveryone who pledges will receive the print and play files to play at home with a bunch of dice and tokens that you have at home.  In fact, what the heck, here is the print and play for anyone and everyone to download and play at their leisure.  The graphics may not match the rules exactly (especially the cards with 5th element dice on them, some are rainbow and some are white, all getting finalized) but the mechanics of each card remains the same. This sucker is huge, at 700 MB, so it will take a few minutes.\nDOWNLOAD A ZIP OF THE PRINT AND PLAY CARDS AND RULES HERE\nDOWNLOAD JUST THE PRINT AND PLAY CARDS HERE\nAND AGAIN, JUST THE RULES\nThe purpose of Quintessential is to combine the more common classic Greek elements into the elusive 5th Element. The first player to produce five copies of the 5th Element and one anti-element to create the Philosopher's Stone wins the game. \nCreating the Philosopher's Stone\nThe elements are represented by dice, the four common elements (represented by red, blue, yellow and green dice), and two more exotic elements; the anti-element (represented by the black dice), and the elusive and crucial 5th element (represented by the white dice).  Will you be the master alchemist and achieve your magnum opus?   \n---\"this really hits on something innovative in using your existing dice to create more dice almost every turn.\"  - Daniel Zayas, The Meeple Mechanic\n1 Box \n80 Six Sided Die - Each die represents an element. These are also used as a bidding tool in parts of the game (see The Rules) \n10 Yellow = Air\n10 Green = Earth \n10 Red = Fire \n10 Blue = Water \n25 White = 5th Element \n15 Black = Anti-Element\n51 Cards - 31 Formula cards, 7 Claimable cards, 10 Personal Multi-Forge and Dismiss cards, 3 Biddable cards\n25 Tokens to represent laboratory assistants in a players color 5 Red 5 Green 5 Yellow 5 Blue 5 Black\n1 Starting Player Token\nStretch Goals are a given for many board game products, and Quintessential is no exception, here is a listing of the additional components we can place in the game.  Currently, the game will carry a $39.99 MSRP in stores, so Kickstarter backers are already getting a discount, but the additional components will raise the MSRP, creating a bigger discount if you pledge now!\n$30,000 - The Worker Tokens will be upgraded to colored beads from the current flat tokens AND Velvet dice bags will be included to hold the starting lab pool for each player.\n$35,000 - The Dice will be frosted instead of the opaque colors that are currently included.\n$40,000 - Dice Cups will be added to shake and roll your dice.\n$45,000 - An in-box Tray will be added to help hold all the components, and a Solitaire variant of the game will be introduced.\n$50,000 - The BIG KAHUNA.  Did you notice that cool wooden box shaped like a die that the prototypes are packaged in during the BGG.TV video?  Yes, everyone gets THAT BOX!  This raises the game to a $59.99 MSRP, and you still pay just $35!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the 4th game produced by Gamer Nation Studios, and as such we are getting experienced at it. However, art delays and overseas shipping delays are not uncommon in this type of endeavor. Also, the production cycle will be very close to the Chinese New Year, and this also poses a risk of delay. We can foresee many issues now, and try to avoid them, but in the end we are dependent on the throughput of our overseas partners. Our factory is well seasoned, and prints for Iello (King of Tokyo) and other large manufacturers, so we are very confident that the quality will be up to the usual standard of a Gamer Nation Studios product. We are also teaming up with a new provider of backer pledge management called Crowd Control. Their system promises that the shipping delays we encountered for some backers in Eons:Cosmic Expansions will not happen again. Speaking of shipping, we will also be using Amazon Fulfillment as our agent to ensure that our entire backer base receives the game on time.

A stable and prosperous port of call in a sea of chaos, warfare, and political turmoil. The Hong Kong Free Enterprise Zone is a land of contradictions - it is one of the most successful centers of business in the Sixth World, and home to one of the world\u2019s most dangerous sprawl sites. A land of bright lights, gleaming towers, and restless spirits where life is cheap and everything is for sale.\nThe lure of a quick payday draws you from Seattle into the neon glow of Victoria Harbor\u2026 and into a corporate conspiracy nearly thirty years in the making. A terrifying threat looms on the horizon - a supernatural force that corrupts and consumes everything it touches. Dragged into the shadows of Kowloon City, you will need to forge new connections and gain \"face\" to survive.\nHong Kong contains fantastic elements for a new Shadowrun setting: an underworld of triads, tongs, and gangs to navigate, wild magic to harness, and bleeding edge cybertech to equip. Plus, Hong Kong\u2019s culture is steeped in \"guanxi\" - a network of influence and relationships based upon a combination of social status, and prestige. All of these elements add up to a great new setting for running the shadows.\nShadowrun: Hong Kong has everything you expect from a Harebrained Schemes Shadowrun game: strong storytelling and sharp writing, lots of morally gray choices, a crew of memorable characters with distinct personalities, challenging tactical turn-based combat, a robust character creation system, and a one of a kind cyberpunk-meets-magic game setting that\u2019s endured for over 25 years. \nOur Backers voted for Hong Kong as the next city for us to bring to life and we\u2019re excited to be working on it! \nYour New Crew\nJust as in Dragonfall, our Hong Kong story will feature a crew of flawed, dangerous runners with backstories that can only happen in the tech-meets-magic Shadowrun setting. \nAnd, as introduced in Dragonfall, you'll be able to guide your crew's advancement by choosing special abilities on their Growth Tracks to complement the choices you make for your own character. \nGobbet is an ork street shaman and a follower of Rat. Her devotion to her totem has granted her unique abilities to control the battlefield, trapping her enemies behind barriers of coruscating magic and herding them with clouds of blistering poison.\nTerritoriality Track: Focuses on battlefield control by buffing Gobbet\u2019s barrier spells (increasing damage, increasing the number of tiles affected) and planting AOE damage spells, such as Toxic Fog. She also gains the ability to destroy or consume summoned spirits, eliminating threats from enemy shamans.\nSpiritualist Track: This track focuses on improving Gobbet\u2019s control over summoned spirits. She can reduce the chance that they slip out of her control, and even seize control of hostile spirits summoned by her enemies. Progressing down this track turns Gobbet into a versatile and powerful summoner.\nWu is a veteran security expert with years of sprawl-site combat experience. He has the muscle and the weaponry to either beat his targets into submission or to break them outright, depending on the demands of the situation.\n\nCrowd Control Track: Focuses on a variety of non-lethal attacks that inflict stun (-AP) effects. Progressing down this track unlocks a shock baton, tear gas grenades, and zip ties to subdue stunned enemies.\n  Lethal Force Track: Focuses on inflicting lethal ranged damage. Progressing down this track gives Wu attack abilities such as Mercy Kill, which does additional damage and has a higher to-hit percentage on targets who are close to death.\n\nIs0bel is a dwarf decker with the tools and the expertise to clear her own way to a target mainframe. Trained for combat by a cabal of hacktivists, she\u2019s as deadly in meat-space as she is in the Matrix.\n\nEspionage Track: Increases Is0bel\u2019s decking skills and her Mark Target ability. Progressing down this tree unlocks new custom programs/abilities for use in the Matrix, as well as custom Expert System Programs (ESPs).\n\nSabotage Track: Is0bel carries a sniper rifle for meat-space skirmishes. Her arsenal also includes proximity mines that she can use to create traps for her enemies. This track increases and adds to the effects caused by these weapons, unlocking higher-yield explosives and Flechettes that strip armor from enemies.\n\nWith your generous support, we're adding Racter to your crew!\nRacter is a highly specialized roboticist-turned-rigger who fights with the aid of \u201cKoschei,\u201d his custom walker-form drone. He also carries an engineering toolkit that he can use to repair Koschei and enhance its abilities during combat.\nMangler Track: Makes Koschei into a melee-ranged wrecking machine. Progressing down this track unlocks movement boosts for the drone and bolts close combat weapons onto its chassis, such as rotary saws and clawed feet. These attachments unlock new close combat attacks for the drone.\nPredator Track: Turns Koschei into a walking artillery piece. Progressing down this track bolts new ranged weapons to the drone, such as an auto-shotgun or a grenade launcher.\n\nWith your generous support, we were able to add Gaichu to your crew! And don't forget, now that Racter and Gaichu are unlocked, their COLLECTIBLE FIGURES have been added to THE TALISMONGER Reward Level!\nThanks to his elite Red Samurai training, Gaich\u00fb has access to close combat abilities that are inaccessible to other characters. These take the form of stance-based katana attacks that flow together in sequence, each of which has its own unique animation.\n\nRed Samurai Track: A mixture of offense and defense. Includes additional sword attacks, such as a coup de grace that can be used to dispatch stunned targets. Gaich\u00fb also gains self-buffs that can temporarily boost his armor, or give him the effects of cover when standing in the open.  \n\nGhoul Track: HMHVV infection has its advantages. This track includes a bite attack that inflicts damage and heals Gaich\u00fb, and claw and spit attacks that inflict damage and cause debuffs on enemies.\n\n\nShadowrun: Hong Kong contains all the features of Shadowrun Returns and builds upon the engine and gameplay upgrades we added to Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut (including the ability to save your game anywhere). \nA Classic, Story-Driven cRPG: The Shadowrun series hearkens back to the golden age of computer RPG\u2019s with a novel-like branching narrative full of sharp prose and deep character development. Immerse yourself in a smart 12+ hour non-linear story with a diverse cast of all-too-(meta)human characters. (Some funding goals will add more hours of gameplay.)\nA One-of-a-Kind Cyberpunk Setting: Experience the unique \u201cTech meets Magic\u201d dystopian future of Shadowrun, a fan-favorite game setting that recently celebrated its 25th anniversary. \nCommand Your Team: Lead a small team of shadowrunners - each with their own outlook, motivations, and backstory. The members of your team are designed to play contrasting roles during missions. Guide your team members as they progress in each of their unique roles, choosing between different focus options to grant them new items and abilities.\nGripping, Turn-Based Tactical Combat: When you\u2019re running the shadows, every turn matters. Choose your actions wisely - move to better cover, charge into melee, or lob a fireball into a crowd of enemies. With over 200 weapons and spells at your disposal, every turn is filled with meaningful choices. \nSkill-Based Character Progression: Choose a starting character archetype and build from there! Street Samurai and Physical Adepts use advanced combat skills to dominate the battlefield, Shamans and Mages summon powerful allies and cast deadly spells, while Riggers and Deckers provide critical technological support, projecting their consciousness directly into drones and computer systems. Shadowrun\u2019s classless skill system allows you to grow your character in any direction you choose.\nPowerful Game Editor: Create Your Own Stories! With the Shadowrun Editor, everyone is empowered to create and share their own stories and campaigns. No advanced coding or art skills are required to create content using the SRR Editor. Our new Hong Kong setting will add tons of new weapons, spells, characters along with oodles of new tiles to the long list of editor assets from Shadowrun Returns and Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut!\nSoundtrack\nThe music for Shadowrun: Hong Kong will be composed by fan-favorite Jon Everist, composer of the award-winning Shadowrun: Dragonfall -Director's Cut. Here's an example of Jon's work:\nPC Only Release\nShadowrun: Hong Kong is being developed for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems only. We have elected to focus all our efforts on PC in order to deliver the best game we can without the current processing and memory limitations of tablets. This focus allows us to have higher-fidelity visuals, larger map sizes, and more stuff on screen.\nBecause we want to do more.\nWe're totally committed to making Shadowrun: Hong Kong and we're already several months into development. The project is budgeted, fully staffed, and on-schedule for a mid-2015 release. We also have a story we're really excited about. At our current budget, it's going to be 12+ hours long and at the quality level of Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut.\nBut this is Harebrained Schemes and, as always, we have more ideas than we have budget. \nThat's where you come in.\nBy backing the project, you'll increase our production budget and get more features, more improvements, and more game. Take a look at the funding goals below to see all the stuff we want to add.\nNow, we could always talk to traditional publishing partners, but we\u2019re pretty independent-minded around here and we only want to serve one master - our audience. \nWe're gonna ship a great game and it can be even greater with your help. Our last adventure together was a blast and we think the results speak for themselves. So help co-fund our third Shadowrun game, Shadowrun: Hong Kong, and let's make the best Shadowrun game yet!\n$100,000 - Enhanced Player Controls! In addition to all the new Tech, Magic, Weapons, Consumables, Creatures, and Enemies we're already planning, if we reach our initial funding goal, we\u2019ll add a bunch of interface upgrades. These include the ability to decide which team member picks up an item in free-move mode, item swapping between party members, a player-initiated turn-mode toggle so you can position your team before you enter combat, and a spread-range indicator for shotguns and sweeping melee attacks.\n$150,000 - Animatic Scene Transitions! These are short animated slide shows with voice narration that play at key points in the story - the opening, end of Act 1, end of Act 2, and at the end. \n$200,000 - Racter joins your team of runners! Racter is a Russian rigger with a wry smile who relates better to his custom drone than he does to people. We'll tell you about Racter's unique gameplay abilities and player-influenced upgrade paths when we get closer to unlocking him.\n$250,000 - More Animatic endings! If we hit this goal, we'll be able to create multiple animatic endings for the story to reflect the choices you make in the game.\n$300,000 - Gobbet's personal side mission! Dive deep into the backstory of your team's resident Rat shaman. Gobbet's absurdist philosophy and impulsive nature have led her on a twisting path through life. In her personal mission, you'll get the chance to walk that path with her and see for yourself where Rat takes you.\n$350,000 - More better sound! We can only describe smells (for now) but we can definitely improve on our audio. Dynamic combat music will ebb and flow as a battle progresses, providing more atmosphere and tension. Enhanced Ambient Sound is a catch-phrase for lots of technical babble about making your play environment sound more real and less repetitive.  \n$400,000 - Gaichu joins your team of runners! Gaichu was a member of the Renraku Corporation's elite Red Samurai security force. Infected with the Human Meta-Human Vampiric Virus (HMHVV) on a mission gone wrong, he was forced to abandon his pure-human unit as the virus slowly twisted him into a ghoul. Now a shadowrunner, Gaichu could prove a valuable ally, but his loyalty comes at a price\u2026\n$450,000 - Enhanced Cyber! If this goal is reached, we'll add a new skill to our character creation system that enhances a character's cyberware and unlocks the ability to install powerful new cybernetic enhancements. This system will further differentiate characters with 'ware from their flesh and blood counterparts. We'll also add cyberweapons that you can install into your characters' arm slots, complete with new animations and visual effects.\n$500,000 - Is0bel's personal side mission! Born to immigrant parents of Somali descent, Is0bel has experienced life in the slums of Kowloon first-hand. Escaping at a young age, she retreated into the cold perfection of the Matrix, but her family still languishes in the depths of the sprawl. Her personal mission will take her back to a place that she barely escaped from - and you'll come along for the ride.\n$550,000 - Expanded magic! If we hit this funding goal, we\u2019ll add new gameplay options and equipment for magic-using characters. Shamans will gain the ability to summon Shrine Spirits at specific locations in the Hong Kong environment. These great-form spirits are far more powerful than their mundane counterparts, can\u2019t break away from your control, but are limited in duration. Hermetic mages and physical adepts will gain access to Foci - enchanted weapons and objects that can boost a spellcaster\u2019s magical power or allow an adept to deliver devastating magical attacks.\n$600,000 - Gaichu\u2019s personal side mission! When Gaichu became infected with HMHVV, the Red Samurai code that he'd sworn to demanded that he take his own life. Instead, he took to the shadows, dishonoring himself and the rest of his team in the process. In Gaichu's personal mission, you will square off against a squad of highly-trained warriors who will stop at nothing to destroy their old teammate... and you alongside him.\n$700,000 - Revamped Matrix: Art and Gameplay! If we hit this goal, we'll add more people to the team to revise the look, feel, and gameplay of the Matrix. We want the Matrix to feel more like you're traveling in the digital world. We also want to add new types of Intrusion Countermeasures and new ways of interacting with them so that decking feels more like an illegal entry into someone's system. \n$1,000,000 - Shadows of Hong Kong Mini-Campaign! We have our plans set for the story we want to tell in Shadowrun: Hong Kong, but if we hit this funding goal, we\u2019ll create an ADDITIONAL 4-5 hour Hong Kong Mini-Campaign that takes place AFTER the story ends. The Mini-Campaign will allow you to IMPORT your high-karma Hong Kong character for a challenge only a prime runner could accept.  The Shadows of Hong Kong Mini-Campaign will come out sometime before the end of 2015 and will be FREE to Backers at the $15 pledge level and up. \n\nWe know from experience that fulfilling lots of physical rewards is a big, distracting, and expensive undertaking and we want your funding to go into making a quality game - not into shipping a bunch of tchotchkes. Remember, the people making your game are also the ones making and sending your stuff! So, we created a bunch of cool digital rewards and TWO sweet physical rewards. We hope you like them and we hope you support us. \nHey! Here's a special BONUS for Backers at the $35 Reward level and above!\nEveryone who backs the project at the $35 Reward Level and above will get access to an AUDIO COMMENTARY TRACK from the Shadowrun Development Team. Hear the writers, designers, artists, engineers, and composer discuss how the game was made, the challenges they faced, and the fun they had while making the game. The audio commentary will arrive in an update after the game is released.\nAND everyone who backs at the $35 Reward Level and above will also get TWO HIGH-RES DIGITAL POSTERS that, when placed together, combine into a beautiful Shadowrun Panorama. The first poster contains a Timeline of Shadowrun History. The second contains a Glossary of Shadowrun Slang. Tell your friends!\nAll rewards starting at the CHUMMER ($15) level come with at least one copy of Shadowrun: Hong Kong.\nThe actual figure will be 5 inches tall, fully painted and numbered!\n Here she is along side a Golem Arcana figure.\nThe power of a Fire Ram is no match for the cunning of a Rat Shaman!\nHer final figure will be 5 inches tall, fully painted, and numbered\nCreated over 25 years ago, Shadowrun remains one of the most original and cherished role-playing settings. The game world\u2019s origin story mashes-up the dystopian Cyberpunk future of Blade Runner with the high fantasy creatures and races of The Lords of the Rings in an organic way that produces iconic characters, environments, and situations.\nHere's how it works:\nAccording to the Mayan Calendar (and lots of tabloids), the world should have ended on December 21, 2012. It\u2019s part a 5,200 year cycle of death and rebirth that, in Shadowrun, actually charts the ebb and flow of magic from the Earth. So, on 12/21/12 magic returned to end our world, and wreak holy havoc while starting the next. Aboriginal cultures, who maintained their mystical traditions, are the first to feel the return of magic and use their newfound power to reshape the political, financial, and physical world around them. As the magic increases, Elf and Dwarf babies are born to very surprised parents who carry the right combination of long-dormant genes. But all of these events pale in comparison to the horror of \"goblinization\", which painfully reshapes the teenage bodies of those unlucky enough to carry dominant Ork or Troll genes. And then the first Great Dragon rises from its 5,200 yearlong hibernation and circles over Tokyo, signaling that the world has truly AWAKENED.\nFast forward two generations, to a world transformed not only by the growth of magic but by the acceleration of cyber technology\u2014a continual effort to improve upon the gifts that nature gave humanity; by the inevitable maturation of the World Wide Web into the Matrix\u2014a network directly accessible by the human brain; and by the near elimination of governments as they are replaced megacorporations\u2014monolithic entities who see only customers, not citizens.\nAnd moving through the dark shadows cast by the gleaming towers of the corps, are Shadowrunners \u2013 disposable assets and corporate pawns scratching out a living using a combination of technology, magic, and street smarts. Shadowrunners live between the cracks and operate outside the law, doing the dirty work that corporate wage-slaves won\u2019t soil their hands with and occasionally acting as the only protection the citizenry can turn to.\nWelcome to the world of Shadowrun, where man meets magic and machine.\n Thanks for reading all the way to the bottom!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHere's the good news - we've done this before. More than once. \n\nWe've run successful Kickstarter projects and we've made two Shadowrun games plus a Director's Cut, so we know how to deliver. \n\nThere's always risk in game development, though. In this case, we have a few new team members who need to learn the ropes - but we've got a pretty damn good track record for hiring talented, dedicated people, who go the extra mile for their game and their Backers and they've already distinguished themselves as great additions to the team.\n\nBeyond that, the standard game development caveats apply. Some new features may take longer to make than we thought. Some piece of gameplay may not be as fun as it sounded on paper and we need to revise it several times until we're happy. A critical bug could take a whole week to fix while others take ten minutes. \n\nSo while we've done Shadowrun games before and have a solid idea of what we're doing and how our tools work, we haven't done THIS Shadowrun game before and you never know what's gonna happen.\n\nAnd that's part of the fun of making games.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #43", "update_userinfo": "The Shadows of Hong Kong Bonus Campaign Is Here!!", "update_content": "We are pleased to announce that the Shadows of Hong Kong bonus campaign is now available as part of a free update to Shadowrun: Hong Kong.This update also adds the developer audio commentary Kickstarter reward and a variety of small game improvements such as new visual effects, updated dialogue, and editor features for User Generated Content.\nSo, we\u2019ve rebranded the title asShadowrun: Hong Kong - Extended Edition to reflect all the new content.

The headmaster, the Great Master Zin, has reached his 100th birthday and decided to relinquish his position.  \n\nIn traditional fashion, someone must prove themselves worthy to fulfill his seat. Each of the students have trained for years at the school and wishes to show their worth. Not only does the winner get the seat, but they also gain the respect that comes with control of the Iron Staff of the Ancients.  \nWith the mechanics in Iron Staff we tried to bring in some of our favorite game elements. We realized that might get convoluted, so we set a goal for ourselves. What's the most we could do with the fewest rules. It was a bit of a challenge, but we believe things turned out great.  \n*not final box art\nDuels For the Iron Staff will be packaged inside of a single 8\" x 6\" x 4\" storage box with a flip top front and plastic handle. There will be two rows. This will leave you with plenty of room to sleeve your cards, carry extra game pieces or parts, and have room for future expansions.\nThis nifty box includes:\n8 oversized wizard cards with sliders\n74 Action cards\n56 spell cards\n65 component cards\nCard backs for Component deck and Spell/Action deck.\nOn your turn you can do the following actions in any order:\n- Play up to two action cards\n- Put spells into your station (three maximum)\n- Acquire or discard two components from the component row.\n- Discard up to one card.\nWhen a spell has all of its required components, you are free to cast it during your turn, or to save it for strategic purposes.  Damage done by spells is done to all opponents, while specific effects are targeted. Damage is indicated inside the red circle on the upper right side of the spell card.\n\nAt the end of the turn, you reconcile your hand to five cards (draw or discard as needed).\nYou may play Defensive Actions at any point during your opponent's turn, if applicable.\n\nThe game is won by being the last player whose HP remains above 0.\n\nIt all sounds nice and simple, but your opponents will be standing in your way destroying your spells, manipulating the draw pile, or even reversing spells that you're attempting to play. The cards in Iron Staff allow lots of craziness to happen, while remaining a balanced and entertaining game to play.\n\nThe game play was designed to play quickly. It allowed us to close the gap between players who enjoy fantasy dueling card games and those who enjoy the fun quirkiness of multiplayer \"screw your neighbor\" style games. We've also built in some decision making through acquisition choices, and the ability to choose to cast a spell or to save it for a later turn. This creates an environment that's fun and strategic, while also being familiar and interesting.\n\nAs much as we wanted a fun theme to build from, we also wanted enjoyable game play with lots of replay value. We tried to make all the mechanics intuitive, but also fit thematically and have a proper play and use within the game.  This is a game that should be easy to pick up for nearly any gamer.\n\nDuels For the Iron Staff is designed for players ages 10+.  It accommodates fun play for 2-4 players.  Standard game time is 30-45 minutes.  \n \n\n\nLink to Duels For the Iron Staff - Extended Rulesheet: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kSdaQ-7PbzxtBQmkKW_s4_yD1gV5Woi5E8cCOj5Xlq4/edit?usp=sharing\n\n\nPRINT AND PLAY FILES\nThese files are what we used for our demo copies.  They don't have final art or layout.  Card backs are different.  Some cards will have updates and editing changes.  However, the these do work for playing the game and learning it as people have loved playing our demos with this version so far.\n\nWith these files you need to print 2 each of the Air, Liquid, Earth, and Fire component sheets.\n\nIf you want card backs, print the component backs 9 times and spell/action back 16 times.  \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/oqn3xc4ayiqqmoc/AAC-y6MykJH_1GoOFqEV4iAra?dl=0\n\n\n\n\nHere's one of our test playthrough videos. This particular game took a bit longer as we were trying to over-explain things and be a bit more deliberate for the video.\nIron Staff went through five major rules changes. Cards got tossed while new ones got created along the way. There were endless hours typing Google docs.  There was even a lot of plotting and planning in regards to the packaging.  We definitely put time into this game.   \n\nWe made sure to test this game on a large variety of gamers. We had casual board gamers play it as well as competitive card gamers in our independent testing. \nREWARDS:\nAll backers will be listed in our rulebook as initial supporters.\nHelping Hand - $1+\nYou can pledge any amount you want here.

Many spells provide additional benefits (like taking extra components) that, if done in the correct order, can combine for awesome turns. It's enough to reward players for thinking deeply about what's happening without requiring that they do so to have a chance to win.....\" - JR Honeycutt, The Nerds' Table\n(full article is here)\n\n\nInterview with Meeple Mechanic:\nhttp://meeplemechanic.com/foxhole-fiver/dequan-watson/\nArtsy Brain Games is run by two people: DeQuan Watson and Galen Ihlenfeldt. They are both avid gamers and have a wide range of preferences within the industry.\nDeQuan Watson\nDeQuan is a long term veteran of the game industry.  He has owned a game store for 15 years (The Game Closet) in Waco, TX.  During that time he's also worn several hats in the industry as a writer, organizer, judge, and a semi-pro gamer. He's also worked on previous game projects such as WWE Raw Deal, among others.\nGalen Ihlenfeldt\nGalen is a master of the visual arts.  He has been a professional artist for the past 14 years. Galen has done artwork that ranges widely in variety and medium. His artistry is fantastic as he's done everything from award winning tattoos and etched granite portraits, all the way through traditional artwork such as oil paintings, down the line to Magic the Gathering alters and even animating an 8-bit music video for  the Crayondroids.  He's most recently done artwork for Novus (another Kickstarter project), and is currently doing illustration work for a handful of other upcoming KS projects. \nWe want to take the time to thank each one of you that backs our campaign. We also want to thank each of you that doesn't back us, but has still taken the time to check out our project and let others know about us.\nGetting a project like this done from start to finish is a big deal.

We came to this decision a few days ago, but we figured we'd let it ride through the weekend to let it play out a little longer just to be certain about our decision.  But, before we get to all the reasons an delve into the sad feelings, please know that you'll still have a chance to get your hands on the product.  Please read through this entire update as there's some very important information below.\n\nFirst of all, we want to let everyone know that we REALLY appreciate the support.  It's nice to know that our friends support our ideas.  It's also great to see that so many strangers saw our game and thought enough of us to put a pledge behind it.  \n\nWe spent a lot of time over the past two weeks polling players and we realized a few things.  This time of year has not been great for many projects.  Even a few people we know that have had recently funded projects struggled to get there on the final couple of days.  This was totally a fault of ours.\n\nThere's also two issues that people are having with Kickstarter right now.  The first is that there is a glut of junk.  We need to do a little more to stand out.  We didn't push hard enough to draw people in correctly.  We have to stand out from the crowd. \n\nThere are also a of projects that are late and haven't delivered on their promises.  We're even waiting on a few ourselves and a couple of those are going to end up nine months late.  Even though we had a delivery guarantee, some people were reluctant to back us.  We'll definitely push that harder next time.\n\nIn the past month we've also managed to make a lot of connections with different bloggers and reviewers.  People seem to lean on reviews quite a lot for the successful game campaigns.  We're going to try and get more of those done and linked to give us a leg up next time.  \n\nMore importantly we've spent some time two weeks ago in discussions with our manufacturer. After discussing some ideas, we came up with several neat ideas we could go with.  We also came up with some neat ideas for add-on, extras, and stretch goals, that we could make available within a reasonable cost.  It takes those items to help you reach your goals and that's something we didn't calculate for.  We'll have more ready to go next time.\n\nOh, yeah, I guess some of you may be reading this thinking... \"Next time?\"  Well, this project isn't dead by a long shot.  Too much time has been put in. Too many of you are willing to support it.  And truth be told, we've had too many people play and genuinely enjoy it.  \n\nOur current plan is to relaunch the game in late February to early March.  Between now and then, we'll be putting the finishing touches on Duels For the Iron Staff.  We'll get the box art done and we should hopefully have some actual final product samples in hand by the time we launch.  With the relaunch that should help raise backer confidence.  All we would have to add to the final run would be any add-ons or extras, and of course to do the artwork for the likeness pledge levels, and the create-a-card levels.\n\nWe also want to remind everyone that there's no need to panic about canceling your pledge.  When we cancel the campaign you won't be charged anything.  We will definitely reach out to all of our current backers when we throw this back up early next year.\n\nThe world of Kickstarter is changing and we have to ramp up with those changes.  Customers are also becoming much more selective, so we've gotta go even more over the top with trying to impress people and draw them in.  We've also learned several things along the way for handling this type of campaign.  \n\nWe're pretty certain that we can get funded with a relaunch.  Unfortunately, it's a bit late to implement many of the things we've learned.  After several days of discussion, we decided it's best to just let things rest through the holiday season and then relaunch.  It should work out great from a lot of different angles. As much as we would've loved for our game to get funded with this campaign, we feel good about this decision.  \n\nAgain, we're glad you decided to back us.  We also hope that you'll still support us in early 2015 when we relaunch.  \n\nThanks so much and we hope you'll be in touch and behind our products in the future!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #6", "update_userinfo": "Lots of good things!", "update_content": "First of all, we want to say thanks to all of you that got to meet ups a BGGcon this past weekend.

I'll be there all day Friday and Saturday.  Galen will be there Friday evening and all of Saturday. We'll have our demo copies in tow for anyone that wants to learn the game or simply see it first hand. We'll also be making time to speak with AdMagic, our manufacturer during the weekend to reaffirm everything is as we've planned and expect  We want this to be as smooth as possible after the campaign is complete.\n\nIt also looks like we'll be able to get streaming setup for next Saturday, November 29th.  Once we have definitive times and such laid out, we'll let everyone now.  Right now, the plans are for the stream to run somewhere between 90-120 minutes. \n\nWe also want to introduce you to another wizard, Jaryk:"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #4", "update_userinfo": "Lots of PR stuff coming, but other neat updates...", "update_content": "KICKSTARTER PUBLIC RELATIONS IS HARD WORK\nWe've been hitting up all of our friends and social networks and exposure for our game is starting to spread well.  We're lining up a couple of webshow interviews and a few local interviews in the area with a college radio station and are close to getting a small news story.  \nWe spent some time last weekend at some stores and gaming events to get the word out.  Lots of demo games were played and the responses were hugely positive.  Much more so than we could've anticipated honestly.  It's always nice to feel like you have a good product, but it's definitely nice to hear it confirmed by others and know that we're not delusional.\n\nWe're also contacting different distributors in Europe to be fully EU friendly.  We've got some pretty fair shipping rates right now, but anything extra we can do to draw extra backers from that area of the world will be nice.  Hopefully, we'll have something firm by the end of the week.\n\nWe're trying to setup a live stream of a game demo for Iron Staff.  We've seen that we have already gotten a few backers from across the world, so we figured it would be neat for people to see a game in action and be able to ask questions in real time if we can make it happen.  With backers already checking in from the UK, Indonesia, Germany, Brazil, and Australia, we figure it's the least we could try to do.  If we can make this possibility a reality we'll be sure to post time and date several days in advance.  \n\nWe just got a fresh review up from a demo night at DFW Nerd Night that we did this past weekend.  You can read it here:  \n\nWe have another interview that should be posted on a foreign website later this week.  We''ll get it posted as soon as it goes live.  \n\nWe're trying to spread the updates out to keep from spamming your inboxes.

It was first released internationally in 2009, in 6 languages.\nThe game pits the four most important Hyborian Kingdoms - Aquilonia, Turan, Stygia and Hyperborea - in a fight for supremacy involving war, intrigue and sorcery. Conan, the barbarian hero created by R.E. Howard, is a powerful presence, but he's very hard to control! He may help or hinder your plans, while pursuing his own adventures to win treasure, women, and glory.\nThe game was designed by the same team of authors as the famous War of the Ring board game. Produced by Nexus Games to a very high standard, and published by Fantasy Flight Games in the US, its release generated a lot of excitement and anticipation.\nThe three designers of the game - Roberto Di Meglio, Marco Maggi, and Francesco Nepitello - started to design an expansion almost immediately, to widen the scope of the game and implementing feedback received from the players. But the expansion remained unpublished and the only updates available for the game were unofficial fan-made creations... Until now.\nAge of Conan focuses on the strife between Hyborian Kingdoms.You sit on the throne of one of the major powers of the Hyborian age, reigning with guile, sorcery and an iron fist. It is a strategy game, not an adventure game. In the original design, therefore, Conan is not controlled by a single player. The game focuses more on his role as a reaver, general, and king, rather than on his individual feats. However, it was soon clear the players wanted more Conan! They called for more details about his adventures and a greater role for him in the unfolding strategy.\nThe expansion, Adventures in Hyboria, is designed to improve and expand the role of Conan in the game. It adds a new dimension to his adventures: Conan's stature grows from warrior and thief, to general, and finally, king. His abilities grow as well, making his presence in the game more visceral and more important.\nAdventures in Hyboria adds other new mechanics and game elements. The Hyborian Age is not a time of all-out conflict, and the game includes several paths to victory beside warfare. This remains true in Adventures in Hyboria. The expansion opens more opportunities for player-vs-player conflict, such as, for example, the new rules for Spies and Prisoners.\nThe success of early playtests with the expansion quickly demonstrated Adventures in Hyboria would make the Age of Conan Strategy Game even better. Unfortunately, the untimely demise of the original game publisher in 2011 (a fact completely unrelated to this product) brought an end to the development of the line, and the expansion remained on the designers' desk.\nAfter a year-long negotiation with Conan Properties and Fantasy Flight Games (publisher of the first English-language edition of the game - see http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=5089), Ares Games finally acquired the license to once again develop the Age of Conan Strategy Game.\nThis Kickstarter will help us to begin development of Age of Conan, once again. If funding is successful, the plan is to publish the Adventures in Hyboria expansion in early 2015 - and set the foundations for development of new products and games in the line.\nThe main goal of this Kickstarter campaign is to fund the pre-production and publication of Adventures in Hyboria, and to relaunch the Age of Conan Strategy Game line.\nThere are only two pledge levels. If you already own a copy of the Age of Conan Strategy Board Game, choose the Barbarian Hero level. If you don't own Age of Conan, choose the Barbarian King level, to include with your rewards a copy of the English-languag first edition (Fantasy Flight Games version). It\u2019s simple, by Crom!\n\"Day 1 Early Bird\" Pledge Levels are available during the first 24 hours after the project launches. They may still be selected when  a slot becomes vacant.\nBarbarian Hero and Barbarian King backers receive these rewards.\nBarbarian Kings receive these rewards in addition to those indicated above.\nNote: We are not including a pledge level for retailers. This is not because we don't want retailers as backers, but because we know how hard it is for a retailer to commit funds several months before the release of a product.

At the beginning of each age, four Conan adventure cards are drawn and used to create the adventure deck. At the beginning of each adventure, players  bid to decide who controls Conan for that adventure. When an adventure ends, a new one is drawn and a new bid determines the new Conan player.\nThe roll of special dice, called fate dice, determines the actions available to the players. The dice are rolled to form a common pool from which all players pick their dice. Each player, in turn, selects and uses one fate die to perform one of the actions allowed by that type of die. When all fate dice have been used, they are re-rolled.\nThe game continues until all four adventures in the adventure deck are complete. At that point, the game temporarily stops so that players can collect gold, build up armies and other resources, and prepare for the next age.\nVictory is achieved by subjugating vassal provinces using military strength; creating alliances using your emissaries; fighting the other players; and achieving specific objectives which become available throughout the game.\nYou can also benefit from Conan's adventures, by accumulating his adventure tokens - Monsters, Women and Treasure - and sometimes, by trying to make Conan the ruler of your kingdom.\nThe game ends at the end of the third age, or whenever - during the third age - Conan becomes the ruler of a player's kingdom... or that player fails in the attempt to crown Conan.\nWant to know more?

Here are a few review links (and excerpts if you don't feel like reading the full review).\nArmchair General wrote: Age of Conan is a good-looking game, with great artwork and well-crafted miniatures (10 different Hyborian sculpts). And it plays as well as it looks, a game of layered strategy with a broad range of options constantly available to players. This is a game any Howard fan must own, and those wargamers seeking a challenging game of tactical depth can stop looking. And you get snake temples on your gaming table. You can\u2019t ask for much more (except a Red Sonja miniature).\n\nDrakes Flames wrote: The Conan part of this game is continued genius... The theme in Age of Conan is executed with what approaches flawless integration of game and source material... Age of Conan is one of the most thematically perfect, deeply intelligent, and just plain thrilling wargames I've played in my whole life.\nFire Broadside! wrote: If you are looking for a wargame at the lighter end of the spectrum which rewards planning ahead and strategic thinking, Age of Conan might be for you. If you also happen to be a fan of the setting then it's definitely a game for you.\nRecently, a video review has been posted by Marco \"marcowargamer\" Arnaudo.\nAdventures in Hyboria is an expansion for the Age of Conan Strategy Board Game. It is not a stand-alone product and a copy of Age of Conan is required to play (that's why we are offering the Barbarian King pledge level!). What does Adventures in Hyboria add to the original design? In this section, we take an in-depth look at its contents and gameplay.\nThe PDF preview of the \"Alpha\" version of the rulebook can be downloaded here.\nA video preview of the \"beta\" prototype of Adventures in Hyboria is now available (by Marco Arnaudo) \n And a combined Age of Conan/Adventures in Hyboria preview by Undead Viking:\nAnd here is an overview of the new contents and mechanics (we assume you have some familiarity with the Age of Conan gameplay).\nIn Adventures in Hyboria, Conan's adventures are tracked by a special board, charting his progress from lowly beginnings to the most powerful throne of his age. His life is divided in three stages: Warrior, Mercenary and General. With each adventure, Conan gains experience, and  develops from one stage to the next, becoming more and more powerful. He can only become King if he reaches a certain experience level, so not every game may end with Conan being crowned.\nAs readers of REH's stories well know, Conan is capable of bouts of energy and fits of melancholy. This is represented by the Mood Wheel. Conan's \"stats\" are used to resolve stories - his Strength, Agility and Cunning - and they improve as the Barbarian gains experience - But Conan's mood also must be considered, as the current value on the Mood Wheel modifies his rolls!\nConan's effect on the game varies as he develops from Warrior to King: A different special die is associated to each stage, to be rolled whenever Conan is involved. The dice also includes new results, like \"Gold\" (Conan needs gold to be hired) or \"No Sorcery\".\nStory Cards add a greater level of detail to Conan's adventures, and add a new level of interaction. In Adventures in Hyboria, each player has a hand of Story Cards. As Conan travels across the land, you may play a Story Card as soon as he's in an appropriate location. Then, you try to complete the Story, using the new mechanics (Conan's stats and mood). If you are successful, not only you reap the rewards, but you also have a chance to take control of the Barbarian away from the current Conan player.\nFrom Taurus to Valeria, from B\u00ealit to Juma, many of the best Conan stories feature great characters fighting alongside the Barbarian. Now these characters are also featured in the game, appearing during an adventure and used to specific effects (normally to help Conan during a Story).\nOften, wars are not won with armies alone, and Hyboria is far from an exception! Spies are a new playing piece available to Kingdoms. At the beginning of an age, they are spread out all across Hyboria. The presence of a spy can help your chances to conquer a Province, forge an alliance, or hinder the attempt of your enemies to do the same.\nConan has quite a dislike for this sneaky, 'civilized' way to deal with conflict, and the presence of the Barbarian often has a fatal effect on a Spy...\nSlavery and ransomed hostages are common occurrences in Hyboria, and the rules for Prisoners are meant to represent this. The possibility of ransoming back your defeated troops and exchanging prisoners means the loss in player-vs-player conflict is less punishing than before, especially in multi-player games, adding yet another level of player interaction.\nKingdom Cards give each player the ability to \"break the rules\", providing each Kingdom a unique gameplay flavor. With many new mechanics added by Adventures in Hyboria, new Kingdom cards allow players to manipulate them and further differentiate the abilities of Aquilonia, Hyperborea, Stygia and Turan.\nWe expect Adventures in Hyboria to ship to our backers in April 2015. We will ship the Age of Conan 1st Edition boardgame to our Barbarian King backers at the same time. We will ship from our main warehouse in the USA and from our secondary warehouse in Germany. No customs charges will apply to backers in the USA or in the European Union.\nShipping your rewards to any destination in the Continental USA is free of charge.\nIf you live in another country, please understand that shipping charges are highly variable by shipping method, destination, and are also subject to change over time. Depending on the success of the Kickstarter, it is also possible that additional secondary warehouses in other countries will be activated.\nFor all these reasons, if you are not resident in the Continental USA we are not including shipping charges as a part of your pledge at this moment.\nBefore your rewards ship, you will have access to a section of our website called a \"Pledge Manager\". There you will have an option to indicate your address and to modify the choice of rewards, if necessary (for example, adding multiple copies). Shipping charges will be calculated and paid at that time.\nWe remain committed to make every effort to keep shipping charges reasonable, while using reliable shipping methods with guaranteed delivery.\nOur estimate of the shipping charges is:\nbetween $ 12 and $ 15 for Barbarian Hero rewards shipping to a destination in the EU (including VAT charges)\nbetween $ 15 and $ 25 for Barbarian Hero rewards shipping outside of the USA and EU\nbetween $ 20 and $ 30 for Barbarian King rewards shipping to a destination in the EU (including VAT charges)\nbetween $ 30 and $ 45 for Barbarian King rewards shipping outside of the USA and EU\nPlease understand the estimate is just that - an estimate - but we'll do our best to make the shipping cost as low as we can.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAge of Conan - Adventures in Hyboria is our fourth Kickstarter project.

The production of the rewards of the third Kickstarter (Galaxy Defenders - The Earth Strikes Back) is in progress, with a confirmed delivery schedule at the moment.\n\nCreating a high-quality strategy boardgame is not an easy task.

Pre-order by emailing sherwoodcardgames@gmail.com. You can keep up to date with Sherwood Games on Facebook, Twiiter, or BoardGameGeek! Once Missing Link is released, you can buy it on eBay or BoardGameGeek!!\nPlease support me and help me create this wonderful game!\n The active player draws two objects from the deck, reveals one object, and keeps the other one hidden. That player provides hints to help the other players guess the name of the hidden object. The trick is that all the hints must be true about both of the objects.\nFor example: If you had an apple card and a skyscraper card, you might reveal the skyscraper and and say \"Both objects are associated with New York,\" \"These are both bigger than a strawberry,\" etc. When someone shouts out APPLE! They get one card and you keep the other. The first player to get to 7 cards wins.\nEach card is a one word, physical object. This helps because people always have physical characteristics to work with - you can always compare size. The active players has 2 minutes to get another player to guess the hidden object (although new players get to wave this time limit).\nCan you compare an ocean and a computer? How many hints can you give if you have a book and a bed? \nWe redesigned the card frames, so these will be the ones in the final product. The old card frames can be seen in the review video below!\nAre you good at guessing? Here are some hints to let you play a round. If you figure it out, private message me and once someone gets it, I will post the answer for everyone in an update and post a new challenge:\nChallenge 4: I reveal an Island.\nBoth these objects can float on water.\nBoth these objects are bigger than a clam.\nBoth these objects can sustain the Japanese population.\nChallenge 3: I reveal a the Sun . \nBoth these objects are yellow.\nBoth these objects are bigger than a grape.\nBoth these objects have an outer layer that is not pleasant to eat.\nChallenge 2: I reveal a Truck.\nThese both contain leather parts.  \nThese both are full of air. \nThese both have have whole industries surrounding them! \nSolved in Update 3\nChallenge 1: I reveal an elephant . \nThese are both smaller than the sky. \nThese are both things you might see on a rainy day. \nThese are both mostly water! \nSolved in Update 2 \nCan you figure it out?!\n Please note that this video is using prototype art and card frames, not final art or card frames!\nFavorite quotes from the video:\n\"Overall, I really like Missing Link, it is a very fun, quick niche party game\"\n\"You can have it up and running in under a minute\"It is more difficult than you would imagine\"\nThe base game will start with 112 unique object cards, but this number will grow as more stretch goals are unlocked.\nAfter playing Missing Link's free-for-all mode for a while, people might crave new and different objects. The team mode delivers this perfectly. In the team mode, players break into 2 teams and pull 3 cards. They choose one of those three cards and use the adjective on the bottom of that card to craft their own objects. Each object must be a one word physical object that can be described by the adjective on your team's chosen card. Once the objects have been made, teams take turns having an active player. The active player picks one object from each team's pile of objects at random, reveals the object made by their team, keeps the other team's object hidden, and then gives hints to help their team guess the hidden object (the object made by the other team). If the active player's team guesses correctly in 2 minutes, their team gets a point.Once each player on both teams have been the active player, the team with the most points wins.\nThis art will act as a launching point, but I will improve it even more after the campaign. I plan to involve my backers as much as possible to make this game the best it can be and since the art is such a big part, I will post samples and seek feedback to make the art the best it can be.\n$1,750     5 new cards from the Kitchen!\n$2,000     5 new cards from the Animal Kingdom!\n$2,500     5 new cards from ???????\n$3,000     5 new cards from ???????\n$5,000     A brand new free to play digital version for when you've forgotten your game at home!\n$7,000     ???????????????????????\nWe will use Charles Levin's Customized Cards and Printing to print our game.

You can Pre-Order your copy of The Great Debate from our website. \nhttp://www.castleproductions.co/store.html\nAges: 13+   Number of players: 3-10  Time: ~4 minutes per player\nWe are a Dallas Designer Group endorsed product.\nThe Great Debate is a card game designed to get people debating quickly over dozens of interesting subjects in a light and casual manner. It plays best from 5-10 players and each round takes mere minutes to play (but you\u2019ll likely find yourself playing it all evening).\nWe all debate with our friends, family and co-workers over numerous topics every day, and even play Devil\u2019s Advocate once in a while. We debate issues from the trivial, such as \u201cIs bacon the ultimate ingredient?\u201d to the profound, such as \u201cDoes charity breed poverty?\u201d This is why we created The Great Debate. It\u2019s a party game that not only provides a highly interactive way for people to voice their opinions about these subjects in a safe and playful environment, but also uses our unique \u201cIcebreaker\u201d system to help you learn more about the people you\u2019re playing with. Who knows, the person you just met might become your new hiking buddy, skydiving mentor, or scrap booking partner! \nThe Great Debate is not just fun, but also educational and enlightening. Since it covers a wide array of topics, people often learn about topics they might not know about. They may hear, or even pose, a different opinion that gives them cause to reflect or laugh. Even those who are initially shy about speaking in groups can quickly overcome their fears since they\u2019re only given 30 seconds to talk on a subject \u2013 and they don\u2019t even have to believe what they say. The point is not to be right, but to be more convincing than your opponent and to have fun while doing it. The time limit teaches people how to hone their debate skills by thinking on their feet, and delivering their points in a short, concise fashion. Play our game, and you\u2019ll soon find yourself having an engaging, thought provoking, laughing great time with your friends and family.\nHere is a limited print and play version prototype to give you idea of the questions in the game.\n80 Unique Debate Cards \u2013 hand selected and play tested for fun!\n5 Blank Cards to make the game unique for your group\n10 \u201cA\u201d Vote Cards\n10 \u201cB\u201d Vote Cards\nRules\nIt's a party -- do you really need rules?

He is joined by Canadian writer Bill Yu in his first comicbook series.  The playful, sexy art is by Jinky Coronado, the FHM lingerie model-turned-writer/artist best known in the comics biz as creator/writer/artist/cover model of BANZAI GIRL and artist of Meg Cabot's best-selling AVALON HIGH graphic novels.  She is joined by her frequent collaborators from the Philippines, Larry Tuazon and Katrina Mae Hao.  (More about them later.  Let's talk about the book!)\nThis volume follows the continuing adventures of team ParaTech, led by a detective and a doctor with both beauty and brains, Shawna Diaz and Lisa Shannon, assisted by tech guru Alan Wong, and backed up by a guy who can handle any situation, Graham Burroughs!  \u201cAdventures\u201d is an understatement as the team once again encounters life, death, and life after death!  \nDiscovering an ancient cross in a vampire\u2019s lair sends the team on a reality-bending trip into their past and hurtles them back to the future with a vengeance!  \nFrom Chapter 1's \"Altered Lives\"\nFrom Chapter 2's \"Night of the LIving Dad!\"\nCreepy splash page scene from Chapter 2!\nBack in the present, the team is exposed to a murderous zombie cult and then has to deal with the aftermath of an all-out assault on their bodies, minds, and souls; one that could rip the team apart!  \nFrom Chapter 3's \"Double Cross\"\nFrom Chapter 4's \"Disciples of the Dead\"\nFollow that up with a visit to a mysterious house that seems bent on killing anyone who enters, and you have a mind-opening thrill ride with all of the intrigue, suspense, humour and sex-appeal that are the hallmarks of EXPOSURE!\nFrom Chapter 5's \"Blind Faith\"\nFrom Chapter 6's \"Dread & Breakfast!\"\n\nAs mentioned above, EXPOSURE is the brainchild of writer David Campiti and the late, great artist Al Rio (known for his incredibly detailed and gorgeous covers, interior art, and pin-ups for companies such as Image, Marvel and Zenescope, from GEN13 to Spider-Man).  \nNow:  In Volume Two, David continues the legacy he started with Al Rio as the torch is passed to FHM lingerie model-turned-comics-creator/ writer/artist Jinky Coronado (of BANZAI GIRL fame) and the industry\u2019s newest rising star writer, Bill Yu!

(Hope it wasn't too hard.  We LOVE this book!)  So what now?\nOver at the top right corner of this page is the GOAL. If that goal is reached, printing will commence immediately because this book is already completed and at the printer, awaiting $$ to get printed and shipped.  However, if the goal is not reached before the end of the 30 days, you will not be charged anything. You only pay if the EXPOSURE \u2013 Volume 2 graphic novel project reaches its goal by the deadline!  Printing will be done in Asia, as most graphic novels are done these days, to cut down on printing costs but maintain premium quality. \nWe've set the goal pretty low here -- and it only covers the trade paperback.  We actually need to reach about double our goal to cover completely the trade and the hardcover (not to mention all the costs associated with running and fulfilling this campaign).  We can easily reach -- and surpass! -- our real goal if you go for the big incentives.\nThe incentives are absolutely amazing and there\u2019s something for everyone at every donation level -- regular books, autographed books, signed and numbered books, hard-to-find original editions, bonus packs with Exposure -- Volume One included, original art, custom sketches, full-fledged finished cover-quality custom original pieces drawn specifically for you, and even once-in-a-lifetime travel experiences!\nOriginal art incentives available will include choices from nearly every page from this graphic novel (available on a first-come, first-served basis), as well as special pinup pieces created for the book, such as --\n  Jinky's self-portrait, based on the Norman Rockwell painting\nWhat's more, the custom commissions being offered could be very much along those lines with Jinky's EXPOSURE or BANZAI GIRL characters, or even Marvel/DC/other popular/new characters, such as these -- \nJinky drew this commission for Rocky Mountain Con's program book!\nJinky's commission of Lois Lane!\nJinky drew some of the characters from the TV series CHUCK!\nThis was a BANZAI GIRL commission!\nJinky Coronado draws a commission of Superman and Supergirl!\nJInky's Wonder Woman and Batman!\nShe's up to the task, don'tcha think?\nSo please, let's make this happen in a big way.\nUPDATE!!

For example: \"I Feel Panicked At The Beach Because I Saw ______!\" You can shout anything, like, \"A shark!\", \"A smoke monster!\" or even \"My grandmother in a bikini!\".\nThe fastest player to shout a valid answer wins the point, but you have to outwit your friends - if two or more players answer, the host player picks his or her favorite. The games moves rapidly, switching from scene to scene in seconds - from Your First Date to A Haunted Mansion to Outer Space!\nThe first player to gain 3 points is the winner. Learning and playing the game are quick - just like your knee-jerk reaction!\nWant to try playing with the cards? Try out the Knee Jerk Randomizer!\nFast, Simple Gameplay: Because the fastest player to answer wins the point, the game zooms by. Each situation lasts ~10 seconds, and if you didn't win the last one, there's another one coming in just a moment's time. The game is also quick to set up and learn, with just a half-sheet of instructions.\nNo Downtime: In Knee Jerk, everyone plays at the same time. Only the host handles the cards, so there's no clean up between rounds.\nOver 150,000+ Combinations: With Knee Jerk's innovative \"arrow-locking\" card design, any three cards can be combined. This means you could play the game over 10,000 times and never see the same situation twice!\nOpen-Ended Answers: Any ending is possible in Knee Jerk - it's all up to your imagination. You could mention your badass grandma, that dinosaur you rode, or the fake superpower no one knows you have. The endings are limitless because you're not trapped within the confines of \"answer\" cards. Feel free to be as creative, dirty or family-friendly as you like.\nPortable: Knee Jerk is one deck of 55 cards, so you can easily slip it in your pocket or purse. And you don't have to sit around a table to play! You can play on the couch, in the car, at the airport - anywhere you can find space for 3 cards.\nClick here for a PDF of the rules (4 MB) and here for a Print 'n Play of the game (47 MB).\nIncrease your pledge amount to get the add-ons below!

In lieu of this, we will send out a free digital print 'n play version of all cards to all backers.\nNote: The \"new ways to play\" above don't add additional components to the game - they use the same 55-card deck.

My first licensed board game, Merc Mayhem, is due out by publisher APE Games in 2015. My background is in video games, working at PopCap Games on Bejeweled Blitz, Zuma Blitz, and Solitaire Blitz. I was also the lead designer at SilverTree Media on the Disney TRON Legacy online games Disc Battle and Light Cycle. I gained my chops at Carnegie Mellon University's Entertainment Technology Center from leading game design professor Jesse Schell. You can read more here in my interview with Indie Cardboard.\nMark Major is the graphic designer and other developer of Knee Jerk. He was a finalist in the 2014 Tabletop Deathmatch series, and in March he won the The Game Crafter's Mystery Design Challenge. Mark has licensed two of his games to board game publishers, including Jupiter Rescue by Twilight Creations and Chimera Station by Tasty Minstrel Games. He has also designed video games, with experience on Cave Story and 1001 Spikes. Mark is also a contributor to the League of Gamemakers.\nWe conceived of Knee Jerk at a Game Design Summit in 2013. Since then we've developed the game into something we're proud of and can't wait to share. The best way to both gauge interest and spread the game is through Kickstarter.\nWe can create the game only with your contributions, so pledge to the project and share this page with your friends.

The color coordination helps young players to keep track of game play and turns while it helps older players when their dice roll off the table.\nWhat Makes Roaches Unique?\nRoaches is a unique gaming experience because it involves several gaming skills:\nGame master - will roll their die to determine what room the players roaches are in, as well as to determine what everyday danger the roaches must face. The game master will then lead the players through a little role playing where they must try to defeat the every day danger in order to move on. Players - evade the everyday danger, and then they will have to battle one another for control of the house. The players will roll their die when battling one another for the rooms of the house they are trying to invade. Cards - players get to use their roach cards to keep track of which of their roaches survived to battle on and which roaches have met an early demise. The backs of the cards show the roaches in a deceased pose so players get to flip the card over when the roach dies to show that it is no longer in play. Dice - players will roll their dice when evading everyday dangers and when battling one another.\nThe prototype of the cards with the original artwork\nLearning: Roaches provides young players with the opportunity to practice recognizing which numbers are greater than other numbers, it provides them with the opportunity to work with others, as well as providing them the opportunity to make choices about their own game play and how those choices affect the outcome of the game. As players become more accustomed to game play there are portions of the rulebook that encourage them to add an aspect of role playing to the game, so the game provides a stepping stone for our future gamers. When they grow past this phase then they will use the roaches skills to enhance their game play and finally once they have all of this down they will go to the advanced rules where they can work cooperatively and where they will use new skills and even have hit points. This game also helps introduce new gamers to role playing which can seem intimidating when there is a character sheet, multiple skills and stats. This game introduces players to the aspects of role play while giving them character types that they are familiar with.\nThe boys are enjoying battling and seeing who the winner is\nPlayability: Roaches is not simply a game for young players though. We have had great success with families who have played the game and even groups of adult friends who have played the game. Roaches provides a fun dynamic where players can battle one another and use their role playing skills to taunt and tease as they race for total domination of the house. There are several levels of play that allow for playability for many different types of gamers.\nFun for groups of friends\nWhat We've Done\nWe has been publicly play testing Roaches for several years now. We've have great success with children ranging in age from five \u2013 fourteen at numerous gaming and comic conventions in and around the San Antonio area. We have also had great success with the parents of the children who played, with families, and with groups of friends. We have even had a teacher using the game in her fifth grade classroom to assist them with critical thinking skills. Roaches is a great way for players to come together no matter what their level of expertise is and play a fun game with friends or family where skills can be learned and used to increase their level of game expertise or simply to have fun playing a game about roaches. We have tested it, now we simply need to give everyone out there a chance to play it. We have also been working with a comic book artist to update the artwork to a newer more polished style.\nNew Art\nRoaches T-Shirt\nWhy We Need Help\nWith your help, we'll be able to print a fun box, a professional set of cards, a rules booklet and dice and we can pay for the new art; then we can begin to ship them to the stores who've asked for them, and hopefully to the ones who haven\u2019t asked for them as well.\nWe need $8000 to get going, but for every few dollars over $8000, that's another set of games that we can print and another gaming shelf we can stock.\nThank you all for your support.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOne of the major risks we have is not funding. We have tried to get this game funded previously under our game company that is set up for games for adults and with the original art. We have play tested Roaches for many years and have been asked over and over again when the game would be available for sale but when we went to Kickstarter we could not get funded, so we asked more people and still people liked the game but then some people advised us that perhaps the adult name of the game company hindered us from getting the game funded, and some distributors and promoters advised us that updated art would also be a big push, so we have changed both of those things and we have played the game some more and now we are ready to try again. We love this game, we believe in this game and we know that other people do too but there is always an inherent risk in putting yourself out there and asking other people to love your creation as much as you do.

Lanterns: The Harvest Festival is a tile-placement game set in imperial China. Players act as artisans decorating the palace lake with floating lanterns. The artisan who earns the most honor before the festival arrives wins the game.\nOn your turn, you can take these three actions one time each:\nPlace a lake tile, which gives every player (even your opponents!) a lantern card based on the orientation of the tile. (It also could give the active player bonus lantern cards or favor tokens, depending on the placement.)\nSpend favor tokens to trade one lantern card for another.\nDedicate sets of lantern cards to gain the honor you need to win the game.\nFor more details, you can download and read a draft version of the full rulebook. (Translation: French.)\nIf you want to play Lanterns to see if it's a good fit for you, you can use our print-and-play (PnP) files to make a prototype. It requires only 4 sheets of card stock if you have Ticket to Ride, 8 sheets if you do not.\nKen Grazier, Geek Craft\n\"Lanterns is an amazing game. It's simple, fun, and thematic. ...

A big thumbs up from me.\" (link)\nRyan LaFlamme, Cardboard Republic \"Lanterns hits that sweet spot of a short game \u2013 quick to grasp on the first playthrough but with enough depth to make you want to play it again. ... Lanterns is easy to play and even easier to learn. It doesn\u2019t seem at first like you\u2019ll have to make many calculated choices, but as the points go up and the number of available tiles goes down, suddenly those tiles feel a lot heavier.\" (link)\nJ.

This gives them a more impressive, durable feel.\nAt $15,685, we started the artwork for three new platforms. Instead of 11 platform tiles with flowers, the game now includes only 2 flower platforms plus 3 tiles each of the new backer-voted platforms: koi fish platforms, dragon platforms, and panda platforms. (View Update #4 for details.)\nAt $19,685, we upgraded the box in a number of ways. (View Update #4 for details.)\nOriginal box cover sketch\nAt $23,885, we will upgrade the cardboard favor tokens to wooden favor tokens in every copy of the game. (These will have the same imperial seal from the cardboard tokens screen-printed on them.)\nAt $29,885, we included a custom starting-player token in the shape of a Chinese fishing boat.\nFor the ARTISAN pledge level (one copy of the game), we contribute $7 towards shipping costs for all backers. For backers in the United States, China, and Hong Kong, this covers all shipping costs. Backers in other countries must add an additional amount to their pledge.\nFor more than one copy of the game, backers should use the DOUBLE ARTISAN pledge level.

We are owned and operated by Randy Hoyt (Game Producer) and Tyler Segel (Creative Director).\nWe raised funding for our inaugural game, Relic Expedition, in April 2013 and delivered rewards to backers in December 2013. (Relic Expedition is on sale for 20% off at [http://RelicExpedition.com/buy] through the end of this campaign.) With this successful campaign, Lanterns: The Harvest Festival will be the second published game from Foxtrot Games.\n\nChristopher Chung is a game designer from Toronto, Ontario. He is a member of the Game Artisans of Canada (GAC), and he loves to play family-style games like Ticket to Ride and Gravwell. You can find him playing and designing games at Snakes & Lattes or Bento Miso, watching hockey (Go Leafs!), or dragon-boating at Ashbridges Bay.\n           Beth Sobel is an illustrator from Bellingham, Washington with an MFA in Painting from Savannah College of Art and Design. She has illustrated games for Stonemaier Games, AEG, Fantasy Flight, and Margaret Weis. In her spare time, she enjoys hiking, reading, and a weekly board game group.\n\n\nWe know Foxtrot Games would not exist without the amazing support and enthusiasm from our Kickstarter backers. We will always be grateful for that! It has been so rewarding hearing how much many of you have enjoyed Relic Expedition, interacting with you on BoardGameGeek and Twitter, and meeting some of you in person at conventions and at game stores. Thank you!\nThank you, Christopher Chung, for trusting your game design to us. It has been an honor and a privilege to work with you on Lanterns. You are a talented game designer with a bright future, and we are proud to be your first publisher.\nWe appreciate all our play-testers for taking the time to play Lanterns and give us feedback on it. We are so pleased with the final version of the game, and it would not be as great as it is without your input.\nLast but certainly not least, an enormous amount of gratitude is due to our families.

This Kickstarter will fund the completion of the 3rd exciting volume of the Dusk series (post-production and formatting costs).\nThe Series Plot: \nAs a battered wife, Eve\u2019s only concern was keeping her marriage together. But when she is kidnapped into the sordid supernatural world of vampires and foul magic, Eve finds she doesn\u2019t want to leave. Her mysterious benefactor, the Vampire Lord Ash, wishes her to have a normal life, but Eve chooses to stay in his service. Dusk is the story of Eve's challenges living in the darkness, a supernatural action-drama told through a dynamic blend of the sequential art styles of American comics and Japanese manga. Several artists help tell these stark noir tales of vampires and unrequited love. \nAbout Dusk Volume 3: Ashes: \nEve: beautifully flawed and horribly broken. You have all read her misadventures as she has struggled to find her place in the dark world of Dusk. But now in Volume 3, we take some quick glances at her reluctant benefactor, the vampire Lord Ash. See how Ash\u2019s tragic origin is wielded against him like a poisoned dagger. Enjoy a story of betrayal and loss as Eve and Ash meet for the first time. Through Eve\u2019s distorted perspective, watch as her Ash comes alive just for her. Of course, spread out amongst the pages are other tales of the supernatural that Eve battles through, like Dusk\u2019s unique take on werewolves.\nWon\u2019t you join us and enjoy the trials that await Eve and the others?\nFrom the safety of your chair, join in the macabre horror that is Dusk. \nAbout the Publisher: \nDusk Comics is an independent publisher of comics that works with a myriad of different styles, themes, and genres in order to bring our readers the best in graphic entertainment. Our flagship series, Dusk, is a prime example of our philosophy in action. Dusk is a paranormal mystery tale told through separate stories done by a variety of artists, whose unique artistic takes service different moods and themes in each vignette. This gives the reader \"snapshots\" into the world of Dusk and its characters\u2019 lives from different angles and perspectives to provide a more full view of the overall drama and action. \nWhat We Need: \nAs a comic so defined by collaboration, we want to provide current and new fans the opportunity to be a part of the next stage of Dusk and Dusk Comics. We need your help to pay the creators who will put the finishing touches on the pages of Dusk Volume 3 (which include lettering and preparing each page for print) directly as well as to print the volumes once they are complete. This is a great chance to support a creative and independent endeavor to provide readers of all types with stories that will not only entertain but also engage on several levels. \nWe would love to say that we are trying to start a revolution, trying to change the way the industry works, make comics work in new ways, but that\u2019s ultimately not what we are about. We are about the story first, middle, and last. If our stories grow up and do amazing things with their lives we would be very proud parents. But we are happy with whatever our stories become, as long as they're true to their core and that core is something you as a reader find interesting.\nCreative Staff \nArtists (Inkers, Pencillers, Letterers) -\nJoamette Gil - http://joamettegil.com/\nWalter Jimenez II\nSean Carner - http://dirkmaximus.com/\nFranc Czuba\n\nJeff Hurst - http://luancia.deviantart.com/\n\nFederico Zumel - http://www.federicozumel.com.ar/\n\nWriters -\nDavid Doub\n\nShannon McDonald \n\nPage 17\nPage 52\nPage 114\nPLAY\n\n Trailer for Dusk Volume 1\nMusic from - http://www.partnersinrhyme.com/\nRoyalty Free Music and Sound Effects Download the music and sound effects you need for your multimedia project today at Partners In Rhyme", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll of the final production work is being put squarely on the shoulders of Joamette Gil, so it's all dependent on her time and the speed she can complete the work.

While silently navigating through the lab to get back to the cages, someone \u201caccidentally\u201d knocks over a beaker of cologne entitled Compete.  Due to a current side effect, everyone on your team is now under the impression that it's a competition and whomever frees the most monkeys wins.\n In Monkeys Need Love Too, you and your friends battle it out inside the local lab to see who can free the most monkeys. These poor monkeys have been subjected to multiple perfumes and colognes, so some of the side effects they've picked up can either help or hurt you during the game.\nDuring your turn, you draw to populate your hand, storing much needed bananas off to the side so you can feed your monkeys later. Each turn you are able to lay down one monkey card and play one action card. The action cards are primarily used to slow down your opponents as they try to free monkeys for themselves. \nAfter the dust has settled, you are tasked with feeding your monkeys. If you don't have enough bananas stocked up to complete the feeding, the monkeys you can't feed are discarded. You then end your turn by discarding any cards you don't wish to hang on to, usually to help you next turn during your draw if you are running low on bananas.\nAt some point during the game, someone will acquire a specific action card that triggers the alarm in the lab. Of course, they will only use this card if they believe they have enough monkeys to win the game. If the player succeeds in tripping the alarm, the second and final phase of the game kicks in. But hope is not lost for everyone else. All players now draw one card from a secondary deck to determine their end fate. \nYou may escape. You may even find a couple extra monkeys on the way out. You could possibly end up losing some of your monkeys as you exit, or even worse, get caught by security and end up in jail. Finally, you could draw the card that resets the alarm so you can continue freeing monkeys. In the end, the player who escapes with the most monkeys is the winner of the game.\nClick here to see the complete rule book and to try the PnP\n Back It!

It falls into that classic \u201cscrew your neighbor\u201d type of game where you can really kick someone when they\u2019re down and so someone in the lead one turn may be racing to catch up the next (and occasionally you can get \u201cbanana screwed,\u201d which is like being \u201cmana screwed\u201d in Magic, but\u2026 you know\u2026 with bananas, where you just can\u2019t seem to find one to save your life\u2026 or the life of your monkeys, really). The game mechanics are really simple, so teaching it to anyone shouldn\u2019t be a problem. The learning curve is small, so going from \u201cI\u2019ve never played this before\u201d to \u201c7th level Zen Master of Monkeys Need Love Too\u201d is a pretty short trip (like, 2-3 turns at most). The art is cute and colorful, and there is a lot of unique artwork in the game.\n- Jason \"Polar_Bear\" Koepp, Editor in Chief, Tabletop Gaming News\nGeekedupGaming Review Group (Click here for full review)\nMonkeys Need Love Too is an awesome and amazing game for 2-4 players ages 8 and up. Plays in about 15- 60 minutes. Unless its with me and Anna. We'll make it last at least an hour and a half. We had a great run with this title. We really didn't know what to expect. Considering we had not heard of it until the creator had contacted us. But we had a blast and were really happy that we\u2019ve had the chance to play the game and experience saving monkeys. If you've backed this game on kickstarter you won't be dissapointed. Also this is a great game for children. I mean what child doesn't like monkeys. This is a really easy game to play and teach. Reason I know that is because I didn't pass the rules off to Anna. I will be sharing this game with friends and family of mine.\n- Timothy Sexton, Board Game Reviewer, GeekedupGaming\n Noobsource (Click here for full review)  \nIf you're looking to play this with your kids during the family game night and you happen to enjoy games such as Killer Bunnies and Fluxx, then Monkeys Need Love Too is worth checking out.  \n- Brandon Ramirez, Board Game Reviewer, Noobsource\nRoll To Sit! (Click here for full review)  \nThe mechanics look crisp. The rules aren\u2019t complicated. Really simple.  The art doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously. And that\u2019s a good thing. Because it shouldn\u2019t take itself too seriously. There are cards where you THROW POO AT OTHER PLAYERS!  \nIT. HAS. MONKEYS!!! All games need more monkeys.

They\u2019ve been in the business for over 20 years and come highly recommended.  Their portfolio is endless and they\u2019ve shown us great respect along with impressive dedication to both the details of the project and responding to our every need.\nI have always loved humorous board/card games and have been playing them with my friends for years. Being a tinkerer at heart, I eventually decided to develop a game of my own. I love making people laugh and I wanted to create a game that would be fun to play and full of laughs. I founded Topwise Games and started working on bringing my ideas to life. \nMonkeys Need Love Too has come a long way from a homemade game printed on index cards to a fully realized game ready for your next game night. I spent countless nights ironing out the mechanics and play testing the game with friends and locals. When adding in the illustrations, my hope was to have them bring out the humor of the cards as well as add to the overall theme of the game. I hired Rick Menard who did an awesome job of really bringing the cards to life. I wanted the illustrations to immediately bring a smile to the player\u2019s face, and I think he nailed it.\nSo now the game is ready to go and all I need is your help so I can get the first edition ordered. Those monkey aren\u2019t going to free themselves!\n-Will Stateczny\nP.S. I hope that Monkeys Need Love Too is just the beginning for Topwise Games. I am working on several expansion ideas and we\u2019re also already in the middle of play testing our first board game. I can\u2019t reveal much information about it though\u2026other than it involves donuts.\n When Monkeys Need Love Too was first imagined 7 years ago, it was created as a hobby printed up on index cards destined never to leave our gaming table. With the emergence of Kickstarter, we now have the opportunity to turn those index cards into a high quality card game with actual illustrated playing cards that can be shuffled (who here has tried to shuffle index cards? It\u2019s impossible). On top of that, Kickstarter gives us the means to make Monkeys Need Love Too the best game it can possibly be.\n A special thanks goes out to the folks at Indie Game Alliance.  Even though we couldn\u2019t make it to any conventions before launching this Kickstarter, they were there (sometimes without their bumper) to spread the word and give Monkeys Need Love Too some additional traction out in the world. On top of that, they\u2019ve been nothing but open and helpful when we\u2019ve needed to pick their brain for knowledge and opinions.

The tiles can be placed with either side face up, and must make a legal connection to those already placed on the table.\nTiles are two-sided and stacked in two piles, which gives more tactical possibilities and, at the same time, limits randomness.

We still waiting for your feedback!\nUpgrade pack\nWe would like to thank you all for your continuous feedback and the time you spend writing comments. We always remember about our first backers and we have prepared a special Upgrade Pack just for you. Since day one we considered it a non-profit pledge. At the very beginning we were thinking of creating a single upgrade pledge which included components for the owners of both the Emissary as well as the Trian Geek Set. As you have rightly pointed out some components were duplicates. This has now been changed and we have adjusted the upgrade packs to the previous pledges so that no-one feels as if they are paying twice for the same product. We divided this pledge into segments so that everyone can choose what they like. We even prepared a budget version for the ones that just want to get to know the new game mechanics but don\u2019t want to pay for the minis. This division unfortunately means higher costs of packing. Since launching the first edition of Galaxy of Trian two years ago a lot has changed in the gaming market. This includes production and shipping costs. At that time adding shipping costs to the pledges was completely normal. At that time the Trian Geek Set was worth 40$ if you excluded the shipping costs and similarly the Emissary was worth 23$. What is left from the old version are tiles, tile rack, bags and the minerals which are worth 3-4$. Just look how much new content you are getting in the full version. This is not a reprint with minor tweaks. We added a battle mechanic, we fundamentally changed the pointing system. We have added 8 race abilities which make every game feel different. The only element left unchanged is the way you lay out tiles. This is a COMPLETELY NEW GAME. We have analysed this back and forth for the past two days and this is the best way to keep the costs optimised and give you a product you will enjoy."}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 2732, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/clashofminds/galaxy-of-trian", "project_name": "Galaxy of Trian"}}, {"backer": "Dave Killingsworth", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "CLICK HERE to look at the TSR chapter to \"try before you buy\"!\nIf you've already backed the project, go HERE to download Designers & Dragons: The \u201970s right now!\nWhat Is Designers & Dragons?\nDesigners & Dragons is a four volume book series of RPG industry awesomeness, meticulously researched and prettily packaged.

If you\u2019re as thrilled as we are about the chance to dig into the history of our hobby, we hope you\u2019ll help spread the word to people who feel the same.

There are also some other options to consider besides the BILL MY SHIPPING LATER reward tiers.\nIf you want to stay apprised of developments on this project, consider backing us at one of the digital levels\u2014even for $1, a low-cost way to \"subscribe\" to this project's updates. \nAnother good option is to contact a retailer closer to you and arrange for them to order the books you want! Evil Hat's books are distributed and sold to and by game retailers in multiple international markets, including Canada (served by Lion Rampant distribution), Australia (dependent on individual retailers placing orders with us), the United Kingdom (distributed by Esdevium to many stores in the UK and Europe, including Leisure Games), and Germany (often carried by Sph\u00e4renmeisters Spiele), for starters. \nOr you can find a way to effectively \"pretend\" to be a domestic backer by finding a person or organization in the US that can receive a package for you, then get it to you in a way you're willing to afford. (We've heard mention of Ship It To as one option, tho we have no experience with them ourselves.)\nInternational retailers without a reliable distribution source for our books may pledge for the MASTER OF RETAIL reward tier\u2014so long as you have a US-based address for us to ship to.

We've produced multiple printed role-playing games in a variety of physical formats over the past six-plus years. This is a non-fiction book series, which is markedly *less* challenging to produce than a RPG book.\n\nEvil Hat's experience puts us in a fine position to take on the risks and challenges that arise\u2014as with any project, experience tells us a few problems and bugaboos *will* arise.\n\nHere's what we can anticipate as potential problems.\n\nTHE TEXT: While the editing and layout of several volumes is largely done, it's possible that we will identify some glaring issue that we need to address before we take this fully to publication. That can add time, for sure. Luckily we've got an editor, a proofreader, and a historian going over every sentence in close detail, so we feel we have this under control. \n\nPRINTING: Our company has grown up alongside the big boom in digital short-run printing technology. Thanks to the advances made there, we'll be able to print the book in any quantity we need. But printers can run into problems all the same: supply shortages, unexpected delays due to company holidays or industry events, or simply goofing up the manufacture or shipping of the books in some way. With a number of potential domestic printers to use, we'll always have a back-up we can go to in the event that our first choice printer has to be set aside. In the event of defective product, we will send a replacement at no cost to you.\n\nSHIPPING: Packages get lost. We'll work with you to send replacements. Our shipper may take longer than expected. We won't put the book on sale until they've shipped out all backer copies. Shipping costs can end up higher than expected. We'll absorb the overage.\n\nFINANCES: Thanks to the success of the Dresden Files RPG and Fate Core, Evil Hat is\u2014for the game industry\u2014a perhaps atypically solvent RPG company. We've already spent thousands on getting Designers & Dragons to this point, and our bank account continues to look plenty healthy. If an unexpected cost arises, we've got the cushion to take the hit.\n\nIf there's any risk or challenge YOU can think of that we haven't mentioned here, please write in and ask. We love to answer questions, and we do our best to provide an unparalleled customer service experience whenever possible.

In various incarnations, it has been in the making by one person for over a decade. Inspired initially by the PS1 game Galerians with an eye towards everything that inspired it, a half dozen comprehensive rewrites and unpublished reboots later,this game follows in the footsteps of films and novels like Akira, Carrie, Firestarter, and Scanners.\nPsionics is set in the real world, in the present day, or 20 minutes into the future (if you like). The players take on the role of troubled teenagers and young adults who have just had an enormous power hidden inside them - psionic talents - unlocked by external tampering. \nThe PCs - called Espers - will gain the ability to solve the mundane problems in their lives with the superhuman abilities available to them; they will also be confronted with questions about the costs of their powers, from using telekinesis or pyrokinesis to get revenge on the bullies that tormented them, or using mind control to convince their crush to give them a chance. \nMoreover, while the talents that Espers can access give them awesome problem-solving tools to play with, overusing their talents and pushing things too far can result in a catastrophic meltdown that is spectacularly fatal for everyone around them. \nMeanwhile, the PCs are hunted by a multitude of shadowy Conspiracies. These competing Conspiracies are seeking to control and manipulate the PCs into advancing their sinister agendas, and have enormous resources at their disposal. \nSo the story becomes: how do you buck the system and defy these groups seeking to capture and indoctrinate you, while coming to grips with your psionic talents? \nAs a \"typical\" Esper, you're a ticking time bomb of teenage angst, with enormous psychic powers; the Man, in various incarnations, is constantly shadowing you and trying to screw with you, taking away your agency and making you a foot-soldier in their cause. What could possibly go wrong?\nPsionics uses the DicePunk System, a very streamlined and flexible rules set with only four character attributes - Strength, Speed, Wits, and Will - and with player-defined skills augmenting the set list of skills. The DicePunk System is also used in our fangame, Phantasm (2010), which was nominated for an Ennie award for Best Free RPG in 2013. \nOn top of the basic DicePunk chassis of Attributes, Skills, and Combat Techniques, we're going to overlay an in-depth set of rules for psionic talents. These will range from the \"bread and butter\" psionic powers like telekinesis (moving things with your mind, all the way from being able to levitate a coin to being able to throw or crush a city bus), pyrokinesis (starting fires with your will alone), and psychokinesis (mind-reading and mind-control) to exotic psi talents like magnekinesis (weather control), somakinesis (manipulating your body to enable superhuman physical feats), technokinesis (psionically 'hacking' mechanical systems), and necrokinesis (causing a cardiac arrest with a thought). The result is a tabletop RPG that will look and play out a lot like recent movies Push (2009) and Chronicle (2012). \nPsionics Core Rulebook Hardcopy - $40 - This is the same core rulebook that everyone else will get, only at its final retail price. You might notice that its price is a bit higher than the one that backers get; this is because, as the book will be in full color, we will need to sell it for a bit more than we'd initially priced out at retail. Those of you who've backed us at the $25+ levels get a bit of a discount for being part of the campaign. \nPhantasm (2010) Fangame Hardcopy - $25 - Our ENnie Nominated Dicepunk System game, Phantasm (2010), in dead tree format, printed in softcover at 8 1/2\" x 11\".\nPsionics T-Shirt - $20 - Offered in men's and ladies' sizes, the Psionics T-shirt will have a very pretty design featuring art and the Psionics logo. We will be taking a little more time to design this, since we want it to look awesome. \n\nPsionics Comic Book Hardcopy - $10 - All our backers receive a PDF copy of the comic book for free, but we are also offering it as an add-on in its dead tree format. It will be softcover with glossy, high quality full color interior. \nAny one set of Psionics dice (2d6) - $10 - Each set of dice comes with two matching six-sided dice featuring your choice of three symbols (seen below). \nPsionics Poster - $5 - This will be your choice of one of three poster designs, featuring the lush color art you've seen. One is the Fireball image by Ian Llamas, one is the Sweet Tamales image by Claudia SG, and one is the cover art image by Jake Bullock. \nPsionics Sticker - $3 - This will be a Die-Cut sticker with the Psionics logo or one of the three Dice Design images.\nABOUT THE PUBLISHER\nWe are End Transmission Games and this is not our first rodeo, although it is our first Kickstarter!

It's a set of rules that you can teach anyone quickly, and not have them always asking 'what do I roll now?'\" -Mark M., Customer Review\nThe Singularity System  - Our newest release, the Singularity System is a setting neutral science fiction roleplaying game. Our largest and most robust product line with four supplements and counting. Check out the demos we'll be running at GenCon, if you'll be in the neighborhood.\nMuch of the writing is actually already done. Devon Oratz, the author, is not going to be paid up front for writing this book, and Mikaela Barree, the other half of End Transmission Games,  is not going to be paid up front for laying it out. Either out of the Kickstarter funds or at all. Instead the money we've come to Kickstarter to raise will be used for two things.\na) Paying freelance artists for interior illustrations, to ensure the best possible production values.\n\nb) Paying for the actual production costs of publishing the book. Namely, printing and, where necessary, shipping. This is where the bulk of the money will go.\n\nWe will also be releasing custom dice made for Psionics. Here are the designs we've come up with:\nWe are also looking forward to publishing the first adventure book for this game; if we reach $10,000, we'll be able to release it sooner than later. \nPsionics is set in the real world, either around now, or about twenty minutes in the future. Now of course in several secret ways it actually differs from the real world as we know it. But PCs aren't aware of those secret differences when the game starts. Only the GM is. So every way in which the world of Psionics secretly differs from the world we live in is in fact a minor spoiler. This may seem strange, but probably shouldn't. The World of Darkness, Unknown Armies, and Call of Cthulhu all use the same conceit, to one degree or another. Anyway, it doesn't mean that we can't hint at how Psionics differs from the real world... and how the lens of the Psionics game sees the real world.\nPeople in the nice parts of North America and Western Europe have it pretty darn good, but complain endlessly on their blogs and social media about their first world problems. People in third world and developing countries don't have it so good, and are often beset by sectarian and ethnic violence, famine, and drought, but they tend to whine less on the Internet, and take less selfies. Increasingly heated arguments about gun control and birth control and religious and sexual freedom rage throughout the civilized world, an endless spectacle that grinds on with neither entrenched side gaining a millimeter of traction, as the major political parties preach increasingly irreconcilable differences, while practicing increasingly identical policies. \nAt least... that's what everyone in the world thinks, with the blinders over their eyes firmly in place. When those blinders get cut away, things start to look mighty different. The secret history of the world that hides in the shadows of the world we know begins to come into focus. The world's superpowers have been locked in a paranormal arms race that dates back to the end of the Second World War and Operation Paperclip. During the early cold war, the U.S. government secretly conducted mind control experiments to compete with those of the burgeoning U.S.S.R.. We could not, gentlemen, allow there to be a mind control gap.\nSince the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War, the psychic think tanks of the great powers have balkanized, splintered, and gone rogue. Gone underground, and gotten smarter. People think that the coldhearted barbarity of Operation MKUltra was the disastrous end to the government's mind control research. In reality, it was the glorious beginning.\nThroughout the world, in developed countries, reports are suppressed of individuals that are more than human. People who can move objects or fire guns with their minds. People who start fires. People who can give you a brain aneurysm with a word, a look, or just a thought. In the war-torn chaos of Africa, Mexico, South America, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East, these Espers hide in plain sight, vanishing into myth, legends and ghost stories from the world's perpetual battlefields and constantly shifting battle lines. No one - at least no one with your best interests in the forefront of their mind - has noticed that the numbers of reports, and the number of legends, are steadily increasing.\nThe world approaches a turning point - a tipping point foretold by seers whose prophecies have since been [REDACTED]. A new dominant species is emerging, day by day, faster and faster. A great storm is on the horizon that will change the world forever, and most of us will not survive. That sound you hear out your window is the thunder.\nPsionics is a DicePunk System game. If you haven't heard of the DicePunk System, no one holds it against you. Not a lot of people have, and while we're working round the clock to change that, it's an uphill battle. What hasn't helped is that the DicePunk System is the THIRD name of the DicePunk System. The first two names we had picked out were less... distinctive... and also already in use by other, completely unrelated game systems. This has lead to much confusion and sorrow.\nTo avoid further confusion, please know that End Transmission publishes many fine products that AREN'T DicePunk System games. Right now, there is only one other DicePunk System game on the market. It is called Phantasm(2010). It's a full color, high quality 210 page PDF. It costs only \"Pay What You Want\" dollars. This has tended to make people think we're crazy, but there's a reason for it. Phantasm refers to a specific movie IP that we don't at all own. In other words, Phantasm is purely  a \"fangame,\" in the same way that some works are fan art or fan fiction. It's a labor of love, and that's why it's given away for pennies or less. To use a software analogy, it's \"postcardware\" or \"beerware.\" The reason it's got (2010) on the end is a) to distinguish it internally from numerous earlier unpublished versions, and b) to distinguish it from Phantasm (1979), the same way you would with a movie. If you want to know a bit more about the DicePunk System, feel free to check it out.\nIn the meantime, let me tell you a little bit about the DicePunk System. Compared to something like Shadowrun, Dungeons & Dragons (any edition) or the HERO System, I would tend to describe the DicePunk System as rules-lite. When put next to something like Fiasco or FATE, not so much. So let's call it \"Rules-Medium\" for now. You can find tons of stuff that's more complex, and some stuff that's even simpler.\nIf you've read this far, well first off, congratulations. I know that was a lot of text. Secondly, you're probably all \"YEAH, YEAH, FINE, BUT WHAT CAN I BEEEEEEEEE?\" by now. Well...good question!\nThere are three primary \"trees\" of psionic talent: Telekinesis, Pyrokinesis, and Psychokinesis. In turn, each of these \"primary\" talents branches out into an array of more exotic secondary talents. Espers can divide their ration of psionic power between multiple talents, but you must have a good grasp of a primary talent to pursue any of its linked secondaries.\nTelekinesis is the ability to move, manipulate, or hurl macrosopic objects through sheer will alone, and is arguably the most basic and \"coarse\" Primary Talent. More \"advanced\" talents work on the same principal, but a finer scale. Pyrokinesis manipulates molecular activity to increase or decrease temperature, while Psychokinesis manipulates neurons and brain waves to alter brain activity.\nHowever, as gross and obvious as its effects may be, the raw effectiveness of Telekinesis cannot be denied. A fledgling telekinetic can manipulate (at line of sight range) objects of no more than ten pounds in weight with a fair degree of precision, and can telekinetically throw or strike with these objects.\nAn intermediate telekinetic can manipulate objects weighing as much as a  hundred pounds, telekinetically pull objects out of enemy's hands, telekinetically aim and shoot a firearm (for a total of three guns used, with one in each hand and a third levitating), shove people back a half dozen feet by battering them with telekinetic force, and use a telekinetic \"force field\" to deflect incoming attacks.\nA powerful telekinetic can do all of the above, move and throw objects weighing up to four hundred pounds, grab other characters with telekinesis and throw them, \"squeeze\" them, choke them, or rip them apart limb from limb like a very meaty wishbone. They can also levitate themselves and fly.\n\nA master telekinetic can move and throw around objects weighing up to ten tons (somewhere between an 18-wheeler tractor trailer with cab and cargo and a 747 jet), grab and instantly crush or tear apart two people at once, or splatter numerous people standing in one area with a blast of force.\nPyrokinesis is a Primary Talent that grants the ability to modify matter and energy by accelerating or decelerating molecular activity. Speeding up molecule movement increases temperature; slowing it down decreases it. This translates to the ability to make air and people spontaneously combust into flames, to melt a solid metal door to slag, or to boil someone in their own skin.  Pyrokinesis is the most purely destructive of all of the Primary Talents, and one of the most feared (and most lusted after).\nA fledgling pyrokinetic can manifest a flame about the size of a closed fist, or - by concentrating - increase a person's body temperature at a rate of about 7\u00b0 Celsius every ten seconds. (Health tip: bringing someone's body temperature to 100\u00b0 is very bad for them. Because they boil inside their own skin, and die.) Even fledgling pyrokinetics also gain \"resistance\" to fire damage by instinctively lowering the temperature around their body.\nAn intermediate pyrokinetic can manifest a fireball the size of a small campfire, and can melt incoming bullets in the air before they make impact. This turns the bullets' damage into fire damage, which is then reduced by their heat shield.\nA powerful pyrokinetic gets better at all the above, can manifest a bonfire-sized flame, and can ignite several people within a fifteen foot radius with a thrown fireball. They can also increase a person's body temperature by 35\u00b0 Celsius or more in about ten seconds, or increase the temperature of an inanimate object by about 1750\u00b0 Celsius in the same amount of time (the melting point of steel is around 1370\u00b0 Celsius). \nA master pyrokinetic is a rolling holocaust of fiery destruction, continuously incinerating everything within a 30 foot radius from any point within line of sight. Anything that survives the initial blast of flames will almost certainly be set on fire from that point onward. A master pyrokinetic is effectively immune to all but the most extreme damage from fire and heat.\nWhile some well-meaning science fiction authors and game designers confuse psychokinesis and telekinesis, for our purposes psychokinesis is defined as the Primary Talent to read and manipulate human minds. It works on the same principle as telekinesis, but a finer scale, adjusting neurons and brainwaves.  However, that doesn't mean that the practitioner is consciously twiddling around individual neural signals. The Talent itself in many cases translates intent to results. Psychokinesis works only on human minds. Most traditional examples of psychic power and extrasensory perception fall under the purview of Psychokinesis; of course, most historical examples of those powers are still the work of con men. Ironically and recursively, many of history's best con men subconsciously leveraged psychokinesis to sway their marks. At higher levels, psychokinesis can push and trick weak minds; at its highest levels, the Talent can dominate weak minds utterly. For this reason, many consider it the most insidious and dangerous Talent of all.\nA fledgling psychokinetic can telepathically communicate with anyone they know from anywhere, or anyone they don't know who's in line of sight. They can also read surface thoughts from a human mind within line of sight. All psychokinetics are immune to the mental tampering of weaker psychokinetics.\nAn intermediate psychokinetic can read memories and deep thoughts, and are capable of two-way \"telempathic\" communication (which can include images and feelings, and isn't restricted to words). They can also unleash a psychic scream that disorients, deafens, and distracts a target.\nA powerful psychokinetic can read and access any thoughts and memories. They can \"push\" the weak-minded, either forcing them to obey a brief (and non suicidal) command, or tricking their senses with a psychic \"illusion\" (i.e. someone would see a gun in your hand when there was none, see no gun when one was there, or see a $1.00 bill as a $100.00 bill). Finally, a powerful psychokinetic can remove or alter memories that a target formed in the past 24 hours.\nA master psychokinetic can do all of the above, and much more. They can dominate the mind completely, turning anyone into a willing slave: they say \"put your gun in your mouth and pull the trigger\" and you do just that. They can also force someone's mind out of their body entirely, and \"remote control\" that body like an helpless puppet. Telempathy is effortless for them, and psychic surgery allows them to alter, remove, and add memories from any point in a victim's life, completely reprogramming a human mind with post-hypnotic triggers. This is obviously not a kind thing to do to a friend.\n These powers are enormous, but they aren't limitless. There are limits, and they aren't just of the \"run out of mana points and can't cast spells\" variety. You can run out of Psi Power, of course, and need to rest. If you push things too hard, you can take actual damage from straining your own powers - nose bleeds, seizures, even unconsciousness. But REALLY push things, and you may just overload.\nAn Esper who Overloads is in serious trouble, nearly as much as everyone around him. The first thing that happens is that the player loses control of the character, who spends the Overload period lurching around, clutching his head in blinding, mind-obliterating agony; they are no longer functionally a person, they are ground zero.\nThe Esper in Overload suffers lethal damage every turn they Overload, and their filled Overflow gauge depletes every turn. The Overload doesn't end until the Overflow gauge is emptied or the Overloading Esper is dead.\nThe spectacular manner in which an Overloading Esper kills everyone around them (and perhaps themselves) depends on their strongest Primary Talent. \nTelekinetics emit gravitic pulsar waves which rend, smash, crush and implode their surroundings. Pyrokinetics incinerate everything around them in a maelstrom of nuclear flames.

So, of course we have to do it again, bigger and better!\nDetails: March 6-8 at Dallas Games Marathon (DGM) in Plano, TX. Con Hours are 9am to 2am Fri. and Sat. and 9am to 4pm on Sun. \nActivities so Far: \n2 Guests of Honor!  \nSam Witwer, of d20Radio fame and a little show called Being Human, another called Battlestar Galactica, and something a few of you heard of...the Clone Wars Cartoon Series, will join us as one of our Guests of honor, and we are proud to bring the one and only record holder of the longest podcast in d20Radio history to the convention!\nSam Stewart, of Fantasy Flight Games will also be a Guest of Honor. You know him from \"small\" titles like Edge of the Empire and Age of Rebellion and many other successful projects from FFG.  We look forward to having Sam share his RPG expertise with us and play a few games along the way!\nThe Gamercred madness continues, with earnest collectors discovering new badges, new ways to earn them, and a serious upping of the \"game\" this year.\nWe will have full-team ARTEMIS up and running again during the convention, with its own dedicated \"bridge room\"!  It was a smash hit last year, and we look for even better things from our captains this year!\nSaturday at 10pm in the East Room, we will have Gamer Nation Con After Dark.  Last year, this featured GM Brev and Bang Dice, and basically became \"beerfest 2014\".  But this year, we're adding some entertainment, and may try to steal an old favorite and \"dub that hentai\" (if interest exists).  Parents are respectfully informed that minors will not be allowed in the main room after 10pm.\nSunday from 10am to 2pm will be Proto-Game Day, yet again! Test upcoming games from designers who want to play test with you, our attendees! \nThere will be tons of Star Wars RPGs, X-Wing and LCG action for you hardcore Star Wars fans. We have HUNDREDS of board games available for check out from the DGM WALL OF GAMES! We will have RPG events for Edge of the Empire, Pathfinder, D&D, Mutants and Masterminds, Fiasco, Numenera and many more! \n2pm on Sunday, we will have a repeat of the successful \"auction\" for cool games and stuff that won't cost you ANY money!  Simply play as many games as you can, earn XP for playing, and spend it on some serious SWAG.\nd20Radio Supporters!\nIf you can't make the convention, and you want to continue supporting the programming and such from d20Radio, we invite you to throw $25 at us and get a bunch of modules and goodies in the special backerzone.\nThe backerzone has been a repository for multiple items that we give exclusive access for a period of one year, before that content is available to the public.  Last year, we had a ton of modules, map tiles, tokens for roll20 and other items added by our sponsors of d20Radio and so it will be again!\nChris West of Maps of Mastery will once again create a series of maptiles that will form the ice caves that we all know to be Echo Base! This is good stuff!\nThis year, the modules lined up are a series of 3 episodic modules from GM Chris entitled \"Inglourious Rebels\", featuring a series of adventures set in the Age of Rebellion where the PCs are a covert ops team of Rebel Agents who do the unknowable (very much mimicking the things you'd find in the film \"Inglourious Basterds\").\nDave steps up with another module titled \"Escape from Cloud City\" where the PCs are tasked with stealing a rare and precious item, but they are discovered and have to make an escape against all odds.  If they are captured, it means certain death!\nThe Fandom Comics guys will have a module ready that was promised last year, but they got hired by FFG to make, well, Suns of Fortune and the AoR GM Kit, so the module was replaced by multiple modules GM Chris created last year....but we have it on good authority it will be ready very soon after the kickstarter ends!  (And by \"good authority\", we mean we've SEEN it, and it's a 3-act epic that is utterly amazing.)\nOf course, GMC is back offering up his time to run skype games for you or, for a higher pledge, your entire group.  These spots are limited, though, and went fast least year.  They were a blast and he looks forward to getting these games in late this year and continuing into 2015.\nSTRETCH GOALS!!!!\nWe made our goal in only 4 days!  So, let's stretch a bit.\n$6,000 - 2 Items\nFirst, Staff Contributor Ben Erickson give us The Krayt's Pearl - Where the PCs are a group of treasure hunters tasked with finding the location of a recently deceased canyon krayt dragon to recover the pearl for a collector. What begins sounding like a blue milk run turns into a fast and frantic competition to uncover the hidden messages the collector has hidden around Tatooine, assemble them to find the hidden coordinates, and be the first to find the corpse and bring the pearl back to him for a huge payout. You aren't the only ones looking for this payout, so work fast and work well. And remember - there are fewer rules on the fringe of space.\nAlso, Wayne Basta brings us another short story, titled \"Rock Falls\", another in a long line of great contributions this d20Radio Sponsor is known for.\n$7,000 - IMMEDIATE MODULE RELEASE - Escape from Smuggler's Hold\nThis module, from the guys at fandom comics, features a group of heroes that have to stage a prison break and endure a long chase through a canyon on speeders.  The module is broken into three parts, for 12 awesome hours of gaming greatness, so it's like getting three one shot modules in one and you won't have to wait for it, it will be made available to all the backers for this year and last.\nBUT WAIT, THERE's MORE!\nThe guys at fandom comics included maps in the modules, but we will also be releasing digital files that can be used to create 24x36\" maps for use with this or any other campaign you choose!  An awesome reward as a stretch goal!\n$8,000 - VIDEO TIME AGAIN! / AND A SWEET PAZAAK TROVE!\nYes, we can replace Dave's stolen video equipment and will record select scenes in Chris' alternate universe AoR campaign and will present to you \"The Destiny of Running on the Edge in this Age\", a look at how GMC prepares and runs his games for the enjoyment of everyone at the table.\nAlso, at $8,000, we will immediately release to all backers an amazing print-and-play fan-created version of the classic Star Wars card game, Pazaak!  Designed by devoted fan Ryan Dugas, these beautiful cards are inspired by the original Clone Wars cartoon, and include custom d20Radio card backs and a set of rules/\"guide\" written by a champion Pazaak player.\nA Guide to Pazaak\n $10,000 - Live Stream and A KEG!\nHelp us get to $10K in the last few hours and we will provide a keg on Saturday night!  We also have another module from GM Phil, featuring huttball and the players playing companion characters from The Old Republic MMO.  AND, AND!!!!  We will live stream from the Convention!

This truly original board game is made up entirely of tiles that represent a dungeon, monsters and the items that could be found within. At the start of each game the tiles are shuffled and the dungeon is randomized creating a new extremely dangerous adventure every single time!\nGame components: 4 Hero tiles, 100 Dungeon tiles, 1 - 6 sided die, Draw string game bag\nPocket Dungeon Quest is meant to be played cooperatively with 2-4 players and is modular, which means multiple copies of the game may be combined to create even larger dungeons to explore and allows more players to join the fun!\nPLAY\n\nCheck out the video above to see how easy it is to learn how to play Pocket Dungeon Quest!\nBasic gameplay begins by randomizing the dungeon. Every player chooses their hero from 4 unique classes. Each class has a unique skill that will aid in the dungeon crawl. The Kickstarter exclusive version of PDQ includes the Adventurer class which will not be released again in any PDQ expansion, ever. Heroes adventure through dungeons, fighting monsters and collecting items and spells that may aid them on their way. \nBy finding the exit the party has the option to venture down to the next floor of the dungeon. Each new level becomes more and more dangerous, so proceed with caution! Can you defeat the Boss who lurks at the bottom?\n*PDQ Prototype copy featured in this photo\n*Print & Play PDQ featured in this photo\n*Print & Play PDQ featured in this photo\nThe goal of the game is very simple, the heroes must find and retrieve three relics and make it out of the dungeon alive. If even one hero falls then the game is over in true hardcore rogue-like fashion. This is the main objective in Pocket Dungeon Quest. Because PDQ is modular other goals may be attempted or created by players and could prove to be just as valid and enjoyable. Some alternate goals that have been tested include;\nDelving Deep - How deep into the dungeon can you go before your hero falls?\nMonster Slayer - Slay as many monsters as you can before falling pray to their menace!\nFrom the very beginning I wanted to be very deliberate about the game design so that Pocket Dungeon Quest could be easily picked up and played by anyone. The rules are kept simple and the components are kept just as simple; 100 tiles make up the dungeon floor, there are 4 hero types (5 in the Kickstarter exclusive version) and 1, 6-sided dice.\nPocket Dungeon Quest is in the final stages of pre-production, which means artwork is finalized, manufacturing costs have been quoted and final plans are being made to bring PDQ to the public. My next step is to raise the funds necessary to push Pocket Dungeon Quest into full production mode. My plan is to have the complete game available to purchase online and in select stores by Thanksgiving. I know that is very soon and we are working hard to make it a reality. I want everyone to be playing PDQ with their families and friends at Christmas and I need your help to make this happen!\nKickstarter Exclusive Adventurer Class included in the physical copy!\nIf I am able to meet and exceed the base goal there are a few things I would love to do.\nFor every $1k beyond the base goal a NEW TILE will be added to the base set allowing for more customization to the initial dungeon. Beginning with the Pegasus at $6k. New tiles to be revealed at $6k, $7k, $8k, $9k and finally at $10k.\n Detailed descriptions will be given for each new tile as they are revealed!\nThe Pegasus Walls are no longer a barrier and may be freely flown over while the Hero is riding the Pegasus.\nHeart Containers! Finally, a decent way to keep track of your Hero's health. Seriously.\nThe Multitool is a one time use item that allows the Hero carrying it to disarm one trap during the course of the game.\nThe Confusion Spell makes monsters attack each other instead of the Hero!\nA Skeleton Archer does not flee when turned up by the foresight spell but can attack the heroes no matter when or where they turn up. Watch out!\n$7.5k GOAL: A custom die will be included with colors and artwork that better fits the feel of PDQ\n $10K GOAL: Reaching this tier will allow me to upgrade the materials of the tiles from standard cardboard to a higher quality material yet to be determined. What I am looking at currently is, punchboard or MDF hardboard. I am currently in talks with a few manufacturers pricing these items. The decision will be announced towards the end of the project!\n $25k GOAL: Reaching this goal will allow me to continue work of a couple planned expansions for PDQ which would include new monsters, traps, heroes, spells and introduce some new mechanics to the base gameplay. Some concepts that are being tossed around are:\nThe Pits - Pressure plates that activate more advanced traps, and mini-dungeons to explore\nMonster Madness - Greater varieties of dungeon dwellers to swap out or complement the base set of PDQ\nExperience THIS! - Level up your Heroes, gain exp orbs and better weapons to delve even deeper into the dungeon than ever before\nReaching this stretch goal will allow me to produce these expansions and release physical copies in an online shop and in select game stores.\n$35k+ GOAL: Bring PDQ to mobile! Meeting this stretch goal will allow me to hire a programmer and begin work on a mobile version of Pocket Dungeon Quest.\nPocket Dungeon Quest has a Facebook fan page to help spread the word: Here!\nLike, comment and subscr- uh, wait.

Sadly, the Great Alien Council never considered this possibility. Looks like you are going to have to use your wits and every means at your disposal to escape. \u201cGet me off this planet!\u201d can be heard echoing in the core. \nLift Off! Get me off this Planet has a casual space theme and never takes itself too seriously. My goal was to make an easy to learn, fast-paced game, where everyone feels engaged and \"in it\" until someone has won or the planet explodes! \nThe objective of Lift Off! Get me off this Planet is to be the first player to get their Aliens off the planet using resource cards, action cards\u201a and phases of the moon to escape. If the planet explodes before everyone escapes\u201a the player with the most saved Aliens wins.\nWhat\u2019s special about Lift Off! Get me off this Planet is that Lift Off Point board pieces (such as the Rocket Ship, Satellite, U.F.O etc) are all different and often require multiple players to work together to take off. For example, the Rocket Ship takes a lot of resources (6 Fuel and 6 Screws) and can carry 6 aliens from various players. This creates a great dynamic of semi-co-operative play that can turn real competitive, real fast; initially all players work together to get the first half of their aliens off the planet. Once the population starts thinning, people become more competitive and tricky, using action cards to manipulate the moon, terraform the board, create tornadoes, and more.\nSince the game board is modular, each Lift Off Point board piece creates a different configuration and scenario in the game.  Every session is a new experience with new play dynamics!\nLift Off! Get me off this Planet is a fresh, lightweight take on unit placement and resource management. The cooperative-to-competitive dynamic and imminent doom creates strong tension and drama at the end of the game.\n*Box will also contain an insert to hold the game pieces. **Game contains 5 Turn Cards.\nPlease see Rule Book (downloadable below) for more details, but here are some details on Play actions on your turn\nPLAY: A player starts their turn by drawing two cards and can do any of the following actions in any order:\n> Move (2x): The player can take two movement actions - moving a more desperate alien twice or two panic stricken aliens once. As one movement, the aliens can flee through an exit point at the core to the not-so-stable surface. Then rushing across each segment of the surface (Lift Off and Exit Points) takes one movement point.\n\n> Play Action Cards: The player can play any number of action cards in any order (whether they have a plan or not).\n\n> Pay Placement / Lift Off Costs: If a Lift Off Point is blissfully not full, the player may pay the Lift Off Placement cost in order to place their Alien on the black-and-yellow striped launch platform getting one step closer to safety! The player may also pay a Lift Off action cost at any time.\n\n> Trade 2 Cards for 1: The player may bravely discard two cards of their choice from their hand to draw 1 additional card. This can be done as many times as desired as long as their nerves hold out!\n\nTo end their turn, players move the Moon counter-clockwise one spot on the Moon track around the surface of the moon, as the final, inevitable doom draws closer...\n TheOneTar - Tiffany Preview & Reviews\nUndead Viking Videos\n Weaponsgrade Videos\nThe Dice Tower / Gamer's Remorse Video\nGeekDad.com (Full Review Here)\n\"Lift Off! Get me off this Planet is a sharp-looking game, and has a lot of fun elements to it. Some of the mechanics seem pretty familiar, like moving around, playing action cards, and spending resources. But the phases of the moon is a new one\u2014it can be a little tricky at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's very cool.\nWhile Lift Off!

Also, in order to deliver on time, I've made sure to buffer the schedule sufficiently to manage hiccups, if any occur.\n\nThere are inherent risks whenever undertaking a project as complex and large as producing and distributing a board game, but I have been making complex projects with countless moving parts and large budgets most of my career (video games).

This team of friends has been exceedingly helpful and I'm sure will help as we hit any upcoming bumps in the road.\n\nMost importantly, if something does go wrong, I will keep everyone in the loop as the project moves forward and comes to market.

No more erasing the mat and starting over when the PCs run off the edge! And no more fussing with a rolled up mat!\nThe new run of Tact-Tiles are 100% compatible with the original Tact-Tiles from BC Products.\nIf you are a gamer who uses miniatures, or just in need of a good portable dry-erase and wet erase solution, Tact-Tiles will provide you with the best solution for a play surface. But don\u2019t take our word for it. You can see what others have said about the original run of Tact-Tiles:\nRA Salvatore - \"Read the quotes from game industry giants and believe them. I used tact-tiles for years and will again now that they're back in production (with better production values).\"\nMr. Salvatore also had lots to say in this interview with BC Products, the original creators of Tact-Tiles.\nMonte Cook - These really are wonderful game aids.\nSean K Reynolds - Tact-Tiles \u2014 as in, \u201cHoly crap, they\u2019re making Tact-Tiles again!\u201d \u2014 is a wet/dry erase tile system for gaming maps, and they\u2019re amazing. \nOther Reviews\n  Gnomestew.com\n  RPGcentric\nBlogs/Social Media:\nTen years ago, Tact-Tiles were impossible to find and incredibly desired by GMs. Now is your chance! - @nperkins\nTact-Tiles are great.

Tact-Tiles are back(!) - @DungeonBastard\nA Ruined Manor in Phandalin :)\nWe are ready to go into production right now! By altering the material and print processes, we are once again able to produce Tact-Tiles of the same design and quality as the originals. And we're bringing them back to the market with your help, through Kickstarter.\nTo be perfectly frank, these aren't some cheap knock-offs. These are the real deal, tweaked to improve the manufacturing processes to insure we can bring them to you at an affordable price.\nEach tile measures 10.5\"x10.5\"x.125\", and weighs about 9 oz. And unlike the original Tact-Tiles, the new design is both dry and wet erase.\nThis is a pic of the first completed sample that we feel is representative of the manufacturing run.\nWe expect to go into production within two months of completion of the Kickstarter campaign. This is the lead time required by the injection molding supplier to get the tiles into their production schedule after we place our order. Of course, we will do what we can to speed this process along.\nOnce the tiles are molded, they have to be printed. Based on current projections, we can expect to print and ship about 3,000 tiles a week.\nBackers of the expedited tiers can expect their sets to be among the first shipped. Others will be shipped according to the sets they ordered, with the larger sets being shipped first.\nIn the past few years, shipping costs have risen dramatically, especially for international shipments. We've selected the cheapest possible shipping methods, but the cost is still considerable. We apologize, but unfortunately this is beyond our control.\n$100,000 - Every set of tiles will come with a cardboard storage box. We plan for this box to include a handle for easy transportation, and have enough room for markers as well.\n$120,000 - We will offer a premium carrying case as an add-on.\n$200,000 - We will begin investigating the possibility of doing hex tiles. This would require a new mold, and we need to first determine demand. If you would be interested in purchasing hex tiles, please let us know.\nAdd-Ons\nYou must first back a regular tier containing 6 or more tiles before adding Add-Ons.\nTo select an Add-On, simply increase your pledge total by the amount listed below. At the end of the campaign, all backers will receive a survey. On the survey, you will be asked your shipping address and which Add-Ons you selected.

Please send us a message or email to reserve your copy! \nWe are very proud to announce the next four games coming to the Gryphon Games Bookshelf Series!\n\nLords and Ladies is a first design by brother and sister artists Jason and Jen Corace. \nLords and Ladies is a card game where you control a turn of the 20th Century noble family and their servants. Your goal is to raise your family's status through careful marriages, hiring servants and having children all the while destroying rival families through gossip, backstabbing, and using superior wit!\nLords and Ladies is a game for 2-5 players ages 10+ and plays in about an hour! Lords and Ladies is currently on a ship bound from China to the US and will be arriving in August! \nCOMPONENTS are listed on the back of the box below.\nFull Rules for Lords and Ladies!\nWyatt Earp was first produced by Alea Games in 2001. The Gryphon Games edition (currently being produced in China), updates the graphics but retains the original rules (one change was made by the designers) and flavor of the game!  \nThe Wild West! Tough times and tough characters! Bandits, desperados,rustlers and thieves are everywhere... Take the roles of the brave sheriffs riding on the heels of legendary Outlaws. Capture Jesse James! Hunt Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid! Rich rewards await those brave and daring enough. Just be careful not to let them slip away...\nThe game is played over several hands. In each hand, the players try to earn as much reward money as possible by participating in the capture of the Outlaws \u2013 and with as little help from the other players as possible. The greater a player\u2019s part in the capture of an Outlaw, the greater will be his reward: a player may earn the entire reward, a large or small portion of it, or nothing at all! All this depends on his level of participation and that of the others. By playing their cards, the players come closer and closer to capturing the Outlaws. Also, the more cards played, the higher the reward grows. Players must play both competitively and cooperatively. The player who best plays the cards he draws will win!\nComponents\n29 Sheriff cards (with stars)\n7 Photo cards (1 in each color)\n7 Wyatt Earp cards\n4 Bank Robbery cards\n3 Fastest Gun cards\n3 Most Wanted! cards\n3 Hideout cards\n2 Stagecoach Robbery cards\n49 Outlaw cards (7 of each Outlaw)\n60 reward tokens ($1,000)\n18 reward tokens ($5,000)\n4 summary cards\n7 reward posters\nWyatt Earp is a game for 2 to 4 players from ages 8+ and takes 30-45 minutes to play.\nFull Rules for Wyatt Earp!\nSleuth is a fascinating detective game for 3 to 7 players. This Classic Game was designed by the Dean of American Gaming, Sid Sackson, and was first published in 1971!  Since then it has sold well more than 100,000 copies. Gryphon Games is proud to give it a permanent home in the Gryphon Bookshelf Series! Through skillful questioning of his opponents, each player gathers evidence and then, using his powers of deduction and logic, attempts to discover the identity of the missing gem! \nThe Dealer shuffles the Gem Deck and removes one card, placing it where no player may accidentally see it. This becomes the Missing Gem. The remaining cards are then dealt secretly to each player to form their hands. The players then record the information from their private cards on their personal information sheets.\n Each Gem Card has three elements\u2014gem (diamond, pearl, or opal), color (red, yellow, blue, or green), and type (solitaire, pair, or cluster). Players use Search Cards to try to determine what cards the other players hold in their hands.\nPlay continues around the table with each player using one search card per turn until one player believes they have solved the mystery. They make a note of their guess on their information sheet and check the missing gem. If correct, the player reveals the card by turning it face up for all players to see and wins the game!\nComponents\n36 Gem Cards\n54 Search Cards\n1 Pad of Information Sheets\nSleuth is a game for 3 to 7 players ages 10+ with a play time of about 30 minutes.\nFull Rules for Sleuth!\n\n Any Game from the Gryphon Games Bookshelf Series may be added to your pledge. \nUse the table below to determine add-on amounts.

We are re-imagining the genre.\n#5: Armor\n#10: Combat Overview\n#12: Trullocs, Lukoi, and Character Customization\nStash is a multiplayer online RPG with turn based, tactical grid based combat, an incredible housing system, an engaging story shaped by its players, and much more. It takes place in the high fantasy world of Primordiax: the game world of all Frogdice games. \nStash is the graphical successor to Threshold RPG: our text based, role play required game still in operation after 18+ years (since 1996). Stash's core features include:\nTurn based combat on a tactical grid. \nHousing: Stash your treasures in your personal Base of Operations, which you can build and upgrade from bedroll to fortress. \nCrafting: Use, sell, or enter items into competitions. \nMassive character customization via class, race, build, gear, cosmetics, costumes, pets, mounts, and more. \nCool world story with a unique twist. Players affect the world and the story. \nHand crafted as well as procedurally generated/random dungeons. \nHuge world with hundreds of unique locations, tons of monsters, and epic amounts of loot. \nClans: form with friends and compete for dominance as well as optional solo or group PvP.\nFrogdice is an indie studio in Lexington, KY founded in 1996. With nearly 20 years of experience, we are one of the most accomplished developers of online RPGs/MMOs. Our games are unique, engaging, and a lot of fun. We have attracted a dedicated and loyal fan base that has stayed with us for two decades.\nWe have two successful Kickstarter campaigns under our belt: Dungeon of Elements and ReignMaker (Tower of Elements 2). Both campaigns:\nDelivered on time!\nWere loved by our backers and players.\nDelivered more than we promised in the campaign.\nOur massive experience and track record for success are excellent reasons to have total confidence in our ability to deliver this game.\nThe ability to create a unique look for your character is very important. This begins at character creation with a wide selection of facial features, hair, colors, and skin choices. Once in game, the tremendous gear variety combined with cosmetic armor slots will provide limitless opportunities.\n At launch, your character can be one of the following races:  \nHuman: Known for their versatility and adaptability, they populate all the regions of the world. Humans come in all shapes, colors, and forms.\nDryad: A mysterious race of women, dryads hail from the ancient forests of the world. They carry the beauty of nature with them wherever they roam.\nTrulloc: With their stone-like skin, trullocs call the mountains and deepest regions of the world home. The texture of their skin reflects the variety of the earth.  \nLukoi: Much like their canine cousins, the lukoi exihibit a wide variety of appearances. They fight with determination, fierceness, loyalty and unbridled joy.  \nCatfolk: Sleek and powerful, catfolk prowl the land seeking mystery and adventure. Their feline appearances span a range of color.\nWe plan to add more races post-launch. Other player races in the Primordiax world: Dwarf, Kestrel, Leklek, Salamae, Scorpien, and Talayi.\nAt launch, Stash will have the following primary classes:  \nWarrior: Masters of arms and armor, these juggernauts of melee wade into battle without fear or hesitation. They control the flow of battle by taunting enemies, protecting allies, and sundering foes. Primary role: Tank + Damage.\nHealer: Adept at manipulating the energies of life, healers mend and buff their allies while mesmerizing and confusing their opponents. Primary role: Heal + Buff + Crowd Control.\nElementalist: These magi manipulate the basic elements of the world in mystical and magical ways. Earth, air, fire, and water all answer to their call. Primary role: Damage + Crowd Control.\nHunter: Agility, quick wits, and terrifying precision are the hallmarks of the hunter. In addition to their potent attacks, they have a diverse set of utility skills and the ability to confound and debuff their enemies. Primary role: Damage + Utility + Debuff.\nWe plan to add more classes post-launch. We have some of our own ideas (Bard, Alchemist, Paladin, Necromancer, Psion) and will listen to the community as well.\nTurn based, tactical, grid combat is a core feature of Stash. We took inspiration from classic Dungeons and Dragons tabletop gaming, Warhammer miniature gaming, the \"Gold Box\" AD&D video games, Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, Temple of Elemental Evil, Bard's Tale, and a variety of other turn based RPGs we have played over the years. We combined that with two decades of experience developing video game combat systems. The result is a combat system that is approachable yet deep. The more you play, the more layers you will uncover.   \nYou will strategically make use of class abilities, items, buffs, debuffs, crowd control, healing, movement, misdirection, taunts, traps, the environment, and more to maximize combat effectiveness.\nEverybody loves loot. Stash has loot - and lots of it. Some of it will be incredibly useful, and some of it you'll toss in your junk trunk for fast and easy selling. You can use it yourself, trade it with other players, break it down for crafting, sell it on the market, sell it to NPCs, or stash it in your Base of Operations (BOO): more on that later!  \nWeapons, armor, clothing, jewelry, magical items, legendary items, crafting materials, collectibles, works of art, decorations, pets, and mounts are among the types of loot you will find.\nEvery player in the game has a Base of Operations. We call this your BOO. It starts off as a meager bedroll, but you can steadily upgrade it to a tent, a hut, a house, a mansion, all the way up to an impressive castle. You can decorate and design it both indoors and outdoors. The customization options are almost limitless.  \nYour BOO also serves as your stash. It is where you send back your treasures and show off your trophies. It is also where you build useable structures to craft or just entertain yourself (and your friends).  \nThe BOO is one of the most important features of the game. It provides you with a tremendous creative opportunity while also being incredibly useful. We put a very high priority on this part of the game and it is something that will receive constant attention and expansion.\nStash is a multiplayer online game in a persistent world (MMORPG). You can group up with friends to adventure through the world, plunder dungeons, defeat bosses, or just be social. You can even battle other groups of adventurers in team based PvP.   \nNearly every feature in Stash is designed in some way to promote co-op play or competition. \nYou can also play Stash solo whenever you prefer. We call this \"playing alone, together\" since you still benefit from the presence of other players even while soloing. You can trade with them, share buffs, or just socialize.\nStash has a huge, tile based world that you explore via your \"peg\" on the map. The world view is like a game board in tabletop or miniature gaming. This makes world travel easier, faster, and less confusing.\nAs you explore, you will find \"Points of Interest.\" These can be anything: dungeons, caves, mines, towers, fortresses, camps, etc. You can interact with a Point of Interest (POI) to enter it and explore in greater detail.  \nDungeon is a term we use to refer to Points of Interest. Dungeons are where you will find monsters, bosses, and all sorts of exciting and dangerous activities. There are two types of Dungeons:  \nHand crafted: Locations we have designed by hand for a specific purpose. These dungeons generally have a lore or story reason for their existence.\nProcedurally generated: Random locations with randomly generated maps, random encounters, random elemental affinities, and a random boss at the end. They provide infinite content variety and keep the world fresh and exciting.\nCrafting materials can be found raw or created by breaking down items. If you build the right structures in your BOO (stove, forge, workbench, etc.) you can return to your BOO to craft. You can make weapons, armor, jewelry, clothing, decorations for your BOO, food, and more. You can use the crafted stuff yourself, give/trade it with others, or sell it on the market.\nOnce you get your start with some basic materials and structures in your BOO, you could theoretically never leave civilization. You could focus all your play on your BOO, crafting, and selling on the market.\nClans are a social and political feature of Stash. Players can join together to form a Clan, establish themes of their choosing, and compete with other Clans for dominance. Your Clan will gain levels, power, abilities, renown, and perhaps infamy through your actions and dedication. \nEvery major zone has an outpost that serves as a hub for adventuring in that region. This is where you can find vendors, transportation, and other services. Outposts can be taken over by clans or individuals and run as they see fit.\nThe ruler of the outpost sets policies, maintains vendors and services, and is responsible for its defense. They can also alter the appearance of the outpost. To thrive, the outpost must attract adventurers. In exchange for all this, the ruler earns rewards, coin, and fame.  \nOutposts always retain basic functionality for adventurers, and the major cities are run by the game. It is one of many ways players can have a real, meaningful impact on the world.\nPlayer vs. Player (PvP) is another big feature in Stash. You can challenge another player or party to a duel or engage in a matchmade solo or group battle.  \nWhen you enter a PvP battle a snapshot is taken of your character. The rest of the PvP battle will continue with that snapshot version of your character. You can then choose to continue adventuring with your \"real\" character and find new loot, level up, etc. without affecting the PvP snapshot.  \nClans can engage in wars that include many PvP battles and struggles for territory or objectives.  \nIt is worth noting that PvP is 100% optional. It is there for people who dig that sort of thing.\nFor almost 20 years Frogdice has used some variation of this payment model. We feel subscriptions and box purchases make it harder for people to try our games or convince friends to join them. We want to make it easy for people to play Stash and enjoy playing it with all of their friends. Our philosophy has always been: \"Make the game fun enough that people play long enough, and eventually the money will take care of itself.\"\nInstead of a retail or box purchase, we have a Citizenship Package designed to be a high value equivalent. This package will cost $20-$30 at launch, and is included among other benefits at the $15 tier and above here.\nWe also have a virtual currency called Medallions that is used in Stash and other Frogdice games. Medallions can be used to purchase a wide variety of completely optional things. The Medallion shop is primarily for cosmetics, convenience, and customization. Anything that provides in-game power will also be obtainable by playing the game. \nExamples of things you can buy with Medallions:\nPets (that you can also get in game). \nMounts (that you can also get in game). \nCosmetic items for your costume slots. \nTemporary +% XP boost potions (saves time).\nInstant teleport consumable to your BOO (saves time). \nDecorative house items (that you can also get in game).\nThings we don't do:\nRequire purchases to continue character advancement. \nCreate intentionally frustrating things you have to buy your way out of. \nBait and switch tactics or things that trick you into spending Medallions.\nUltimately, this is a matter of trust between developer and player. Our 20 year history of using this type of model ethically and responsibly shows we do it the right way.\nTo show our appreciation for your generous support of Stash, we have some great rewards. Some are special in-game items, others provide ways to immortalize yourself in the game.\nNOTE: All rewards where the backer designs or names something are subject to approval. It must be appropriate for the game and theme. \nCitizenship Package\nThe Citizenship Package can be claimed by all of your characters. It includes a bundle of potions (including XP Boosts and Healing), a bundle of armor dyes, and a donkey which is explained more below. You also receive private forum access.\nDonkey\nThe donkey is a reliable pack animal that will loyally serve you. Pack animals are incredibly important and useful in Stash. While you are exploring and dungeon delving, you can send items and loot back to your BOO using these creatures. This can be done from almost anywhere in the game world. \nMedallions\nMedallions are the virtual currency in Frogdice games. The Pay What You Want section explains them in detail.\nKickstarter backers receive double the dollar value of their pledge in Medallions. For example: If you back at $15, you receive $30 worth of medallions. If you back at $50, you receive $100 worth of Medallions.\nBackers will receive these Medallions during Alpha/Beta testing and again at launch. \nHead Start Days\nWhen Stash is ready for public launch, backers will be able to create new characters before everyone else. The number of head start days you receive depends upon your tier.\nBOO Interior Decorative Item\nOur backer community will help us choose and design what type of decorative item this is. This item can be claimed by all of your characters.\nFounder's Package\nThe Founder's Package can be claimed by all of your characters. It includes a plaque mountable in their BOO that commemorates their status as a Founder of Stash. They also receive an additional potion bundle and armor dye bundle (with different colors than the Citizenship bundle they also receive). This package also includes:\nFounder's Cloak\nThis amazing and beautiful cloak can be claimed by all of your characters. We will design the look with input from the backer community. It will provide +20% to XP earning until the player is level 20. After that it is just awesome looking.\nBOO Exterior Decorative Item\nOur backer community will help us choose and design what type of decorative item this is. This item can be claimed by all of your characters.\nFounder's Statue\nAll of your characters will receive a statue in their likeness they can use to decorate their BOO.\nFroggie Pet\nAll of your characters will receive FROGGIE the pet. Froggie is highly collectible, cute, and many believe: good luck!\nCeremonial Weapon\nClaimable by all of your characters, the Ceremonial Weapon looks awesome and is useful at low levels. After that it is primarily for display or cosmetic slot use. The exact weapon type depends on your character class.\nCeremonial Armor\nAll your characters will receive Ceremonial Armor appropriate for their character class. It will be great for cosmetic purposes and will get the job done at low levels.\nKorgan Mount\nAll your characters will recieve a ferociously cute and incredibly useful Korgan Mount. Korgans are a race of mighty and adorable creatures that happily serve adventurers as loyal mounts and companions. Like pack animals, mounts can transport loot back to your BOO from almost anywhere in the game world. They can also be ridden to speed up travel on the world map.\nThe Korgan mount is inspired by Frogdice's office mascot, the corgi Teppenheimer Wigglebottoms (or Tehpig for short).\nName an NPC\nYou get to name an NPC that will appear in Stash. This could be a shopkeeper, trainer, barkeep, or something of that sort. \nWrite a Book\nBooks are collectible items found in the game. Some provide interesting lore, others are designed for entertainment. Players can add them to a library in their BOO and read them at their leisure. This is a chance to write your own story that players will enjoy for many years to come.\nName a Dungeon\nChoose the name of a dungeon that will appear somewhere in the game world. This could be a cave, tower, mine, temple, shrine, something similar, or an actual dungeon.\nReserve Your Clan Name and Design Your Clan Standard\nEnsure your clan will ride to glory with the right name and the right insignia emblazoned on your flags, cloaks, and shields. Our plan is to release a clan standard design application you can experiment with before launch. In addition to saving clan name, your clan standard design can only be used by your clan.\nName a Boss\nMost dungeons culminate in an exciting and rewarding boss battle.

Our previous two campaigns delivered ON TIME to happy, satisfied backers. We have continued to support those games with free updates and events. The story from those games continues right into our next game, Stash:\nStash is a multiplayer online RPG with turn based, tactical grid based combat, an incredible housing system, an engaging story shaped by its players, and much more. It takes place in the high fantasy world of Primordiax: the game world of all Frogdice games. In many ways, Stash is the graphical successor to Threshold RPG: a text based, role play required game that Frogdice has developed and operated for 18 years (since 1996). Stash's core features include:\nTurn based, tactical grid combat.\nStash your treasures in your personal Base of Operations, which you can build and upgrade from bedroll to fortress.\nCraft items to use, sell, or enter into competitions.\nMassive character customization via class, race, build, gear, cosmetics, costumes, pets, mounts, and more.\nCool world story with a unique twist. Players affect the world and the story.\nBoth hand crafted and procedurally generated/random dungeons.\nHuge world with hundreds of unique locations, tons of monsters, and epic amounts of loot.\nClans: form with friends and compete for dominance as well as optional solo or group PvP.\nFrogdice is one of the oldest and most experienced developers of online RPGs in the industry. Online RPGs are our passion and our favorite type of game to make and play. Our studio has expanded significantly over the last 3 years with the specific goal of making this game. We need you, our future players, to help us make that dream a reality.\nThe ability to create a unique look for your character is very important. This begins at character creation with a wide selection of facial features, hair, colors, and blend shapes. Once in game, the tremendous gear variety combined with cosmetic armor slots will provide limitless opportunities.\nAt launch, your character can be one of the following races:\nHuman: Known for their versatility and adaptability, they populate all the regions of the world. Humans come in all shapes, color, and form. \nDryad: A mysterious race of women, dryads hail from the ancient forests of the world. They carry the beauty of nature with them where ever they roam.\nTrulloc: With their stone-like skin, trullocs call the mountains and deepest regions of the world home. The texture of their skin reflects the variety of the earth.\nLukoi: Much like their canine cousins, the lukoi exihibit a wide variety of appearances. They fight with determination, fierceness, loyalty and unbridled joy.\nCatfolk: Sleek and powerful, catfolk prowl the land seeking mystery and adventure. Their feline appearances span a range of color.\nAt launch, Stash will have the following primary classes:\nWarrior: Masters of arms and armor, these juggernauts of melee wade into battle without fear or hesitation. They control the flow of battle by taunting enemies, protecting allies, and sundering foes.\nHealer: Adept at manipulating the energies of life, healers mend and buff their allies while mesmerizing and confusing their opponents. \nElementalist: These magi manipulate the basic elements of the world in mystical and magical ways. Earth, air, fire, and water all answer to their call. \nHunter: Agility, quick wits, and terrifying precision are the hallmarks of the hunter. In addition to their potent attacks, they have a diverse set of utility skills and the ability to confound and debuff their enemies.\nTurn based, tactical, grid combat is a core feature of Stash. We took inspiration from classic Dungeons and Dragons tabletop gaming, Warhammer miniature gaming, the \"Gold Box\" AD&D video games, Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, Temple of Elemental Evil, and a variety of other turn based RPGs we have played over the years. We combined that with two decades of experience developing video game combat systems. The result is a combat system that is approachable yet incredibly deep. The more you play, the more layers you will uncover as things get more challenging and rewarding.\nWe put a large emphasis on rewarding PLAYER skill in addition to CHARACTER skill. Your character's abilities and gear are very important, but the tactics and strategy of the actual players is equally important.\nEverybody loves loot. Stash has loot - and lots of it. Some of it will be incredibly useful, and some of it you'll toss in your junk trunk for fast and easy selling. You can use it yourself, trade it with other players, break it down for crafting, sell it on the market, sell it to NPCs, or stash it in your Base of Operations (BOO): more on that later!\nWeapons, armor, clothing, jewelry, magical items, legendary items, crafting materials, collectibles, works of art, decorations, pets, and mounts are among the types of loot you will find.\nEvery player in the game has a Base of Operations. We call this your BOO. It starts off as a meager bedroll, but you can steadily upgrade it to a tent, a hut, a house, a mansion, all the way up to an impressive castle. You can decorate and design it both indoors and outdoors. The customization options are almost limitless.\nYour BOO also serves as your stash. It is where you send back your treasures and show off your trophies. It is also where you build useable structures to craft or just entertain yourself (and your friends).\nThe BOO is one of the most important features of the game. It provides you with a tremendous creative opportunity while also being incredibly useful. We put a very high priority on this part of the game and it is something that will receive constant attention and expansion.\nStash is a multiplayer online game in a persistent world. In that respect it is very much like an MMO. You can group up with friends to adventure through the world, plunder dungeons, defeat bosses, or just be social. You can even battle other groups of adventurers in team based PvP.\nNearly every feature in Stash is designed in some way to promote co-op play or competition.\nYou can also play Stash solo whenever you prefer. We call this \"playing alone, together\" since you still benefit from the presence of other players even while soloing. You can trade with them, share buffs, or just socialize. \nStash has a huge, tile based world that you explore via your \"peg\" on the map. In this way the world view is like a game board in tabletop or miniature gaming. This makes it easier to travel the enormous world without getting lost.\nAs you explore, you will find \"Points of Interest.\" These can represent almost anything: dungeons, caves, mines, towers, fortresses, camps, etc. You can interact with a Point of Interest (POI) to enter it and explore in greater detail.\nSome POIs are hand designed and given a very specific location.\nOther POIs are procedurally generated and random. They will appear randomly as you explore the map and will disappear over time if you do not enter them.\n\"Dungeon\" is a general, atmospheric term we use to refer to Points of Interest. Dungeons are where you will find monsters, bosses, and all sorts of exciting and dangerous activities.  There are two types of Dungeons:\nHand crafted: These are the locations we have designed by hand for a specific purpose. These dungeons generally have a lore or story reason for their existence.\nProcedurally generated: These are random locations with randomly generated maps, random encounters, random elemental affinities, and a random boss at the end. They provide infinite content variety and keep the world fresh and exciting.\nCrafting materials can be found raw or created by breaking down items. If you build the right structures in your BOO (stove, forge, workbench, etc.) you can return to your BOO to craft. Through crafting you can make weapons, armor, jewelry, clothing, decorations for your BOO, food, and more. You can use the crafted stuff yourself, give/trade it with others, or sell it on the market.\nClans are a social and political feature of Stash. Players can join together to form a Clan, establish themes of their choosing, and compete with other Clans for dominance. Your Clan will gain levels, power, renown, or infamy through your actions and dedication. Will your Clan be a shimmering example of honor and fidelity? Or will your Clan be feared and reviled throughout the land?\nEvery major zone has an outpost that serves as a hub for adventuring in that region. This is where you can find vendors, transportation, and other services. Outposts can be taken over by clans or individuals and run as they see fit. This can happen by conquest or vote. \nThe ruler of the outpost sets policies, maintains vendors and services, and is responsible for its defense. They can also alter the appearance of the outpost. To thrive, the outpost must attract adventurers. In exchange for all this, the ruler earns rewards, coin, and fame.\nOutposts always retain basic functionality for adventurers, and the major cities are run by the game. It is one of many ways players can have a real, meaningful impact on the world.\nPlayer vs. Player (PvP) is another big feature in Stash. You can challenge another player or party to a duel or engage in a matchmade solo or group battle. \nWhen you enter a PvP battle a snapshot is taken of your character. The rest of the PvP battle will continue with that snapshot version of your character. You can then choose to continue adventuring with your \"real\" character and find new loot, level up, etc. without affecting the PvP snapshot.\nClans can engage in wars that include many PvP battles and struggles for territory or objectives.\nIt is worth noting that PvP is 100% optional. It is there for people who dig that sort of thing. \nStash will not require a subscription or an up front purchase. We call Stash a \"Pay What You Want\" (PWYW) game.\nFrogdice has utilized this model for almost 20 years. Our philosophy towards has always been: \"If the game is fun enough and offers good value, people will eventually buy something.\" \nWe have designed an incredibly high value Citizenship Package that we hope most players who like the game will consider a minimum purchase. It will cost $20 or more at launch, and is included among other benefits at the $15 tier and above.\n\nWe will have a wide variety of additional, optional things people can choose to purchase with Medallions. Anything that provides in-game power will also be obtainable by playing the game. This is especially important since Stash has PvP.  \nExamples of things you can buy with Medallions:\nPets (that you can also get in game). \nMounts (that you can also get in game). \nCosmetic items for your costume slots. \nPotions that give you a +% xp boost for some # of hours. \nInstant teleport consumable to your BOO (saves you some time). \nDecorative house items (that you can also get in game).\nThings we won't do:\nRequired purchases to continue character advancement.\nCreate intentionally frustrating things you have to buy your way out of.\nBait and switch tactics or things that trick you into spending Medallions.\nUltimately, this comes down to trust. We hope that our 20 year history of using this type of model ethically and responsibly shows we do it the right way.\nTo show our appreciation for your generous support of Stash, we have designed a variety of rewards. Many rewards are special in-game items. Others provide ways to immortalize yourself and become a permanent part of the game you have so wonderfully supported.\nNOTE: All rewards where the backer designs or names something are subject to approval. It must be appropriate for the game and theme. Please keep that in mind!\nCitizenship Package\nThe Citizenship Package can be claimed by all of your characters. It includes a bundle of potions (including XP Boosts and Healing), a bundle of armor dyes, and a donkey which is explained more below. You also receive private forum access to communicate with our team during development.\nDonkey\nThe donkey is a reliable pack animal that will loyally serve you. Pack animals are incredibly important and useful in Stash. While you are exploring and dungeon delving, you can send items and loot back to your BOO using these creatures. This can be done from almost anywhere in the game world. \nMedallions\nMedallions are the virtual currency in Frogdice games. This currency can be used in our online games to purchase a wide variety of things to enhance your gameplay experience. In Stash this includes: boosts, cosmetic items, pets, and mounts. Anything that provides in-game power will also be obtainable by playing the game.\nKickstarter backers will receive double the dollar value of their pledge in Medallions. For example: If you back at $15, you will receive $30 worth of medallions. If you back at $50, you will receive $100 worth of Medallions.\nBackers will receive these Medallions twice: during Alpha/Beta testing and again at launch. \nHead Start Days\nWhen Stash is ready for public launch, backers will be able to create new characters before everyone else. The number of head start days you receive depends upon your tier.\nBOO Interior Decorative Item\nOur backer community will get to help us choose and design what type of decorative item this is. This item can be claimed by all of your characters.\nFounder's Package\nThe Founder's Package can be claimed by all of your characters. It includes a plaque mountable in their BOO that commemorates their status as a Founder of Stash. They also receive an additional potion bundle and armor dye bundle (with different colors than the Citizenship bundle they also receive). This package also includes:\nFounder's Cloak\nThis amazing and beautiful cloak can be claimed by all of your characters. We will design the look with input from the backer community. It will provide +20% to XP earning until the player is level 20. After that it is just awesome looking.\nBOO Exterior Decorative Item\nOur backer community will get to help us choose and design what type of decorative item this is. This item can be claimed by all of your characters.\nFounder's Statue\nAll of your characters will receive a statue in their likeness they can use to decorate their BOO.\nFroggie Pet\nAll of your characters will receive FROGGIE the pet. Froggie is highly collectible, cute, and many believe: good luck!\nCeremonial Weapon\nClaimable by all of your characters, the Ceremonial Weapon looks awesome and is useful at low levels. After that it is primarily for display or cosmetic slot use. The exact weapon type depends on your character class.\nCeremonial Armor\nAll your characters will receive Ceremonial Armor appropriate for their character class. It will be great for cosmetic purposes and will get the job done at low levels.\nKorgan Mount\nAll your characters will recieve a ferociously cute and incredibly useful Korgan Mount. Korgans are a race of mighty and adorable creatures that happily serve adventurers as loyal mounts and companions. Like pack animals, mounts can transport items and loot back to your BOO from almost anywhere in the game world. They can also be ridden to speed up travel on the world map.\nThe Korgan mount is inspired by Frogdice's office mascot, the corgi Teppenheimer Wigglebottoms (or Tehpig for short).\nName an NPC\nYou get to name an NPC that will appear in Stash. This could be a shopkeeper, trainer, barkeep, or something of that sort. \nWrite a Book\nBooks are collectible items found throughout the game. Some of them provide interesting lore, others are just designed for entertainment. Players can add them to a library in their BOO and read them at their leisure. This is a chance to write your own story that players will enjoy for many, many years to come.\nName a Dungeon\nChoose the name of a dungeon that will appear somewhere in the game world. This could be a cave, tower, mine, temple, shrine, something similar, or an actual dungeon.\nReserve Your Clan Name and Design Your Clan Standard\nEnsure your clan will ride to glory with the right name and the right insignia emblazoned on your flags, cloaks, and shields. Our plan is to release a clan standard design application that players can experiment with long before launch. In addition to saving the clan name you want, your clan standard design can only be used by your clan.\nName a Boss\nMost dungeons culminate in an exciting and rewarding boss battle. The first 10 backers to pledge this tier can name one of the bosses in Stash.\nMossy Pouch\nAll your characters can claim this item. The mossy pouch goes in one of your bag slots and it grows with your character in storage capacity as your character grows in level. This is extremely handy!\nYour Name in a Power\nYou can add your name to an ability for one of the character classes. Remember's Bigby's Clenched Fist? Mordenkainen's Faithful Hound? Their pre-internet fame will pale by comparison to you!\nDesign a Pet\nYou get to design your very own pet! Decide how rare it is for the rest of the game as well. All of your characters will receive this pet!\nDesign a Dungeon\nYou can design the map type, theme, enemies, elemental affinity, boss, story, and other special features along with the Frogdice team. As always, when we say \"dungeon\" that could mean any type of location: cave, mine, temple, shrine, tower, ancient library, dungeon, etc.\nPrivate Island for Your BOO\nYour BOO will be located on a private island that can be reached from the normal BOO Point of Interest or docks around the game world. Your island can be explored in world map style with a special point of interest for your BOO.\nDesign a Power\nCreate your dream ability for one of the game's classes. This includes the power's effects, visuals, and name. Game balance and appropriateness apply, of course! \nDesign a World Event\nWorking with the Frogdice team, you will design the storyline behind your event, the types of things that happen across part of or the entire game world, plan for how players may react, and determine how the world might be altered based on the way players react to it.\nFrogdice is an indie studio in Lexington, KY that was founded in 1996. For nearly 20 years we've specialized in online RPGs. Our oldest game, Threshold, is still in operation 18 years since launch. \nWe have a reputation for high quality games that are unique, incredibly engaging, and a lot of fun.

Our first campaign for Dungeon of Elements was a big success and it delivered ON TIME. We are very proud of that. Even better, the game turned out great, is enormously fun, and was extremely well received. Don't just take our word for it: Click here to read reviews and player reactions.\nTower of Elements 2 (ToE2) is a real time strategy and puzzle game with deep city building and match-3/tower defense combat. From your capital city you lead your Kingdom against the invading Void Army that threatens all life.\nYour strategy, tower defense, and match-3 skills will determine the fate of your armies, but the many political decisions you make as a leader affect the story and the culture of your kingdom.\nAs your capital city improves, you will have access to more powerful spells, mightier elite troops, and better battlefield gear and armaments.\nAlong the way you will also earn achievements, complete quests, and fill your Bestiary with enemies.\nThe capital city of your Kingdom is vitally important. This is where resources are gathered, spells are researched, troops are recruited, battlefield gear is constructed, and much more.\nYou will build your capital city on one of three continents: Mitralon, Ta'Raekhet, or Katayvan. Each continent has its own strengths and advantages.\nChoose your continent.\nThere are 8 major building types that you will construct and upgrade. You will also want to grow your population, recruit and train workers, manage resources, and make Kingdom policy decisions that affect both the story and the culture of your Kingdom. All of these decisions will have profound effects on the battlefield.\nTown Hall - Worker and Troop Management\nCombat is handled through a combination of match 3 and tower defense.\nEach tower has a grid of elemental runes. When you match at least 3 of these runes in a horizontal or vertical line, they detonate and send elemental bolts onto the battlefield. Any enemy struck by an elemental bolt will take damage.\nElemental bolts blasting through your enemies.\nThe battlefield itself is managed in a tower defense manner. Troops, barriers, walls, explosives, and all manner of other options are at your disposal.\nDropping an Exploderado device on enemies being held off by the blockades I have placed.\nDuring battle, random quests will occasionally be given to you. You can complete these quests for bonus rewards \nYou will face 10 bosses with unique and challenging mechanics. Combine your skill at match-3 and tower defense to succeed against the Void Army.\nThe Conquest Map Screen\nThere are 10 regions on the world map with 50 towers at strategic battle locations. Each region has a different type of terrain, and each tower has a different configuration. The rune boards vary significantly in shape, number, and presence of special rune types (locked, frozen, blocked, corrupted, etc.). There is an enormous amount of variety in the match-3 part of the game.\nOne of the many, many events that require a policy decision.\nThroughout the game you will make tough decisions as leader. Events will occur where you have to choose the policy your kingdom will follow. These decisions are critical to the story and will also determine the culture of your kingdom. There are four culture traits: Martial, Druidic, Republic, and Elemental. Your decisions will determine the degree to which your Kingdom's culture exhibits some or all of those traits. The result will have both cosmetic and real gameplay effects.\nThe Cubicle\nThere are 10 bosses throughout the game that present distinct challenges and gameplay mechanics. These tend to be some of the most intense and challenging battles in the game. A few of these bosses (or their relatives) are making a return from Tower of Elements 1 or Dungeon of Elements. They have likely picked up some new tricks so be prepared!\nDefeated enemies will occasionally drop scrolls. When you collect a scroll you can then summon and experiment upon that enemy type in your bestiary. This is great fun. Enjoy yourself guilt free!\nTorment your captured foes!\nWe have created a set of rewards that hopefully you will find exciting. We put a lot of focus on giving you ways to immortalize yourself in the game and be a permanent part of the game you have so wonderfully supported.\nNOTE: All rewards where the backer designs or names something are subject to approval. Obviously we need to make sure it is appropriate for the game and our customers. Your designs appear in everyone's copy of the game so keep that in mind!\nA few of the rewards warrant additional explanation.\nNAME A VILLAGER: $50 and up. As your kingdom grows, villagers start walking around the city. When you mouse over them you can see their name. At the $50 tier and above you can name a villager that will appear in everyone's copy of the game.\nNAME A TOWER: $100, $200, and $300 tiers. There are only 50 towers so we had to limit this to those tiers. You can choose the name of a tower in the game. We will try to accommodate everyone's choice of continent but it will be first come first serve based on when people email us after the campaign ends.\nNAME AN ACHIEVEMENT: This is unique to the $200 tier. If you back at a higher tier and really, really want to name an achievement, we can probably work something out. Message us to be sure. We love putting tons of fun achievements in the game. We try to be funny or at least moderately clever in how we name our achievements. At this tier you can name one of them for us! We will note your contribution in the credits.\nDESIGN/WRITE A KINGDOM POLICY EVENT: $300 and up. This is really cool. We will give you some examples of existing policy events so you understand how they work. Basically you write a situation that a fantasy medieval leader might face. You then get to create four possible policy decisions and assign them cultural value effects (Martial, Republic, Druidic, and Elemental). This is a very cool way to have a lasting impact on the game's story. We will note your contribution in the credits.\nNAME A BAD GUY: $500 and up. Take one of our enemy types and change its name. Would you like to change the \"Gobbo Warrior\" to something you like better? Use your imagination to name something cool. We will note your contribution in the credits.\nBE WRITTEN INTO THE LORE: $1,000 and up. Do you have a favorite RPG character you'd like to have immortalized into the Primordiax game world lore? You can do that here! We will work with you to write you or your character into the lore of this game and the lore of the Primordiax world that spans all of our games. This will be specifically noted in the credits.\nNAME THE PENULTIMATE BOSS: $2,500. Our 2nd to last boss was designed specifically so it can be named after someone's favorite RPG character or personality. How cool is it that you can BE A BOSS in a video game? Very cool, methinks. This will be specifically noted in the credits.\nDID WE FORGET SOMETHING? Was there something you would like to have seen as a reward that we didn't include? Do you have a question about our rewards? Go ahead and back at any reward tier and then post your suggestion in the comment thread. We aren't kidding when we say player feedback is hugely valuable to us.\nOur Kickstarter campaign is designed to pay for professional sound and music as well as the polishing phase of the game. Getting players involved in the final stage of development worked extremely well for us in our last Kickstarter campaign for Dungeon of Elements.\nThe feedback and ideas we received from players were extremely beneficial. The testing and analysis from many different computers and hardware configurations was also immeasurably valuable.\nMost of all, the interaction with die hard fans throughout the campaign and game development was very rewarding and ultimately made for a better game. We hope this campaign will have the same excellent results.\nMichael Hartman - President, CEO, and founder of Frogdice \nPang Hartman - VP & Creative Director, and Lead Designer \nAdam Sullivan - Lead Artist \nSean Lucas - Lead Developer \nCollin Brooks - Programmer \nMelinda Picard - Artist \nAnthony Davis - Artist \nMontica Sansook - Artist \nDaniel Hanks - Artist\nDeborah MacArthur - Writer \nTeppenheimer Wigglebottoms, Office Mascot, Corgi Derpmaster\nWe are thrilled to announce that the official wiki for the entire Tower of Elements franchise will be hosted and maintained by Curse Gaming's Gamepedia. \nWe will have links to it soon and invite our fans to start filling it with quality information. Some of our developers will likely assist with that as well.\n Every backer who receives a copy of Tower of Elements 2 will receive a FREE STEAM KEY when the game is Greenlit. You can help make that happen by clicking the graphic below and UPVOTING us on Steam Greenlight.\nEven if you choose not to back our project, we would hugely appreciate your upvote on Steam. Please help spread the word!\nWe want to thank both the Frogdice and Kickstarter communities for the incredible support we have received over many years on all of our game projects. We quite literally could not do this without you.

This includes the additional copies in the combo packs and international combo packs.\n*Dr. Boom is a game originally printed as one of our wallet-sized micro-games. Dr. Boom can be played using specific character cards that come within the box of Two Rooms and a Boom. All of our backers will get the instructions on how to play this devilishly clever 2-5 player social deduction game. That means this box now supports 2-30 players instead of just 6-30 players!!!\nTwo Rooms and a Boom! is a social deduction, hidden role game. Unlike other hidden role games, there is no need for a moderator. Each game is timed (so you know it won't last too long) and you can do whatever you want with your character card, including showing it to other players (that's identity verification). \nAt the beginning of a game, players are equally distributed between 2 separate playing areas (usually 2 separate rooms) and then each player is randomly dealt a facedown character card. There are 2 teams, the Red Team and the Blue Team. The Blue Team has a President. The Red Team has a Bomber.\nEach room has a leader selected by the players in that room. The leader chooses hostages (players who will be sent into the other room at the end of the round). \nThe game consists of 3 timed rounds. Each round is shorter than the previous round. At the end of each round, the hostages selected by the leaders will be traded into opposing rooms. If the Red Team\u2019s Bomber is in the same room as the President at the end of the game, then the Red Team wins. Otherwise the Blue Team wins. \n\"After demoing it for about eight hours, I can safely say that Two Rooms and a Boom is game of the year material.\" - Quintin Smith, Shut Up and Sit Down\n\n\"If you read my previous review for the recently released Mascarade, you will remember I suggested that it would likely be my top game of 2013. While I still love Mascarade, that previous comment only remains true because Two Rooms and Boom will not officially be released until next year.\" - Charlie Theel, 2D6.org\n\n\"Personally, I\u2019m eagerly awaiting the Kickstarter release of the game, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be a oft-played alternative to other late night gaming activities.\" - Ted Alspach, designer of Ultimate Werewolf, owner of Bezier Games, reviewer for Opinionated Gamers\n\"Taking party gaming to the next level...\" - Michael Fox, Little Metal Dog Show\n\n\"Unique take on hidden roles...\" - Drew, Giant Fire Breathing Robot\n\nRead some more great reviews and testimonials.\nThe reason Two Rooms and a Boom was nominated as \"the most anticipated party game of 2013\" on BoardGameGeek.com is because the game has been played worldwide by hundreds of people. The game is currently available for Print-n-Play (PnP) for free on our website, and will continue to remain free for all.\nAlso, we have an amazing group of loyal players that play Two Rooms and a Boom on the BoardGameGeek forums regularly. Chances are really good that they're playing a game right now! So go check out the game there and get in on a Play-By-Forum (PBF) action by clicking here. They're a friendly bunch that are always looking for more players.\nOne of the greatest things about Two Rooms and a Boom is that the game can get as complicated or simple as you want it to be. Besides the basic character cards, there are 36 advanced character cards that come with the base game! These advanced cards can drastically alter the way the game is played.

A group that consists of people of all ages and backgrounds, who are big into games that are super fun and super easy to host.\nBefore the launch of Two Rooms and a Boom, Sean and Alan successfully funded their first Kickstarter campaign for the documentary Boom or Doom, which chronicles their journey as a company and as friends to bring Two Rooms and a Boom to market.\nWe hope you like Two Rooms and a Boom as much as we do, and we really appreciate you taking the time to take a look at our project.

Thank you for your support and thank you for being awesome.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are numerous risks associated with the process of delivering published games. If there is a delay in delivering our game, it is likely to come from one of 3 main sources, artwork, manufacturing quality control, and freight logistics. We have taken steps to ensure that delivery will be on time, but that cannot always happen on time. We see a wider release at Origins (Columbus game convention) as critical to the short-term and long-term sales success of Two Rooms and a Boom. We will not sell Two Rooms and a Boom at any game convention before our Kickstarter backers have been shipped their copies. It is therefore critically important to us that Two Rooms and a Boom ships before Origins! The sooner the better.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: This project is also part of a documentary.

For something so important, shouldn't it do more than just turn on and off?\nWe're creating a series of intelligent and tunable LED lights that are bright, simple, and open a world of amazing lighting experiences.  You're going to like the way your light looks, we guarantee it.\nYou know that feeling of getting into bed and then realizing you left the light on in the hallway? Or flipping through a bank of light switches and dimmers to try and create the perfect mood? Or stubbing your toe as you get out of bed to go to the bathroom? Yea, we hate that too so we're making ilumi to create better lighting experiences.\nilumi works like a regular light bulb in the sense that it just screws into a normal socket. The kicker is that through the ilumi app, you can conveniently control your lights remotely, tune the color & brightness, or even program your lights to create lighting magic. The key for ilumi is that it's bright, simple, and is all about experience.\nWe need your support to finish up development and manufacturing, & in turn we want you to be some of the first to enjoy it!\nWhat are you going to do in your living room over the next 20 years?  Visualize all the festive holidays, birthday parties, or sporting events?  Picture that morning cup of coffee on the couch, curling up with a movie at night, or having friends over for a party.  What type of lighting did you picture in each of those scenarios?\nThe truth is that different scenarios require different types of lighting.  With ilumi, you have complete flexibility to adjust your lighting to any variation of both bright white lights as well as rich colors, at any brightness, any time.  \nPlus, our patent-pending HyperLux LED technology makes ilumi the brightest and most efficient multicolor light bulbs in its class. Essentially, we pack more brightness per watt than any other multicolor light.  That\u2019s important, because it\u2019s nice to have flexibility, but we also wanted to ensure ilumi would give you the functionality for everyday as well.\nWe love lighting control systems but hate that they are expensive and complicated.  With ilumi, you get the convenience of a scalable and customizable lighting control system with the ease of just screwing in a light bulb.  The great part is that it\u2019s super simple.  \nSo turn off all your lights before you go to bed, set your bedroom lights to a romantic scene, or just set that one ilumi in the hall on.  Completely personalize and control your lighting just the way you want it. \nAlso, everything is built inside the bulb, so you don\u2019t have to worry about connecting to WiFi routers or other complications and headaches. ilumi uses Bluetooth 4.0 technology, which is now in nearly every iOS and Android device.  With ilumi, we're also building Bluetooth 4.0 meshing, so  each ilumi can communicate with each other.  Each ilumi has a 100 foot plus range, and multiple ilumi can communicate with one another through the wireless mesh to pass on commands and extend the signal range.\nilumi prototypes with control boards\nYou can also share access with family and friends who download the ilumi app on their own devices. Again, no boxes, routers, master-slave configurations or dependencies -- just screw ilumi in and it just works that simply.\nPlus if you don't have your phone handy, you can always use an old fashioned light switch to turn your ilumi off and on to a personalized default setting.\nCheck out how easy it is to set-up your ilumi:\nIt's all about experience with ilumi.  From the aesthetics of the bulb, to the UX of the app, to the amazing things you can do with your ilumi. Here's an idea of what's possible:\nCheck out the ilumi music sync experience!\nRight now we are building out two sizes of ilumi that with your help we'll introduce to the world.  Both sizes of ilumi work great by themselves or as a team.\nSMALL A21 - The flexible A21 ilumi rises like the sun over the horizon spreading bright light in all directions. The A21 ilumi is great for lamps, fan lighting, and most anywhere else in the home. The A21 produces about 800+ lumens while only consuming 10 watts. That's about 7x less energy than an equivalent 75 watt incandescent.  \nLARGE PAR30 - The powerful PAR30 ilumi shines down like bright light from the heavens (or your ceiling). The PAR30 ilumi is a flood light best for overhead, recessed, or track lighting. The PAR30 produces about 1100+ lumens while only consuming about 15 watts. That's about 7x less energy than an equivalent 100 watt incandescent.\nSince inception, ilumi has evolved quite a bit while still retaining our focus on brightness, simplicity, and experience. We've developed two iterations of working prototypes and now have the final design for both the A21 and PAR30 ready to go.  Check out the photos below to see the evolution of ilumi...\n\nBehind ilumi is the ilumi app, which will be available as a free download in the App Store or Google Play.  Like the lamps, the ilumi app has similarly evolved quite a bit as we've been working on it and with your feedback, we'll surely continue to refine it.   \n\nIlumi is compatible with Android Bluetooth 4.0 (BLE) phones and tablets plus iPhone 4S, iPhone 5, iPad 3 (Retina Display), and iPad mini. If you\u2019re not sure if your Android device supports BLE, check this website here. Android just launched BLE support this summer, and while we\u2019re working on the Android app, the iOS app might ship first.\nWe're also working on a software development kit (SDK) so others can come up with creative ways to use ilumi and share them with the ilumi nation.  Receive the ilumi SDK first by contributing to a 'Light Hacker Kit' perk. \nsome screen shots of the ilumi app in progress\nYes, ilumi is super cool, but it's also responsible.  Switching out your old light bulbs for ilumi will save you money on your electric bill, which is good for you and mother earth. \nHome lighting comprises about 1/4 of one's electric bill so it pays to practice energy efficiency. By combining our advanced HyperLux LED technology's efficiency with programming and automation functionality, ilumi is the most energy efficient light bulb in its class. And every ilumi lasts up to 20 years.\nThat means every ilumi pays for itself multiple times over through the course of its life. Changing out your old incandescent light bulb for a large 15 watt ilumi can save you about $265. Switching out your small 10 watt ilumi for a 75 watt incandescent you can save about $190.\nFrom day one, our focus has been on making ilumi functional, flexible, and simple with a world class experience.  This ethos is apparent in everything from our HyperLux LED technology to our automatic set-up process.\nWe believe that this focus will not only ensure that ilumi will be a great product, but one that you\u2019ll have and enjoy for a long time.\nshades that come with the BLINDED BY THE LIGHT reward\ntee that comes with the LIGHT HACKER reward\nWe've put a lot of blood, sweat, and tears into ilumi...well figuratively, and we are so close to turning our dream into a bright reality.  It takes a lot to manufacture a quality product, and while we are close, we need your help to get us over the last hump.  There's tooling expenditures, cost of components, and manufacturing costs ahead, but also we need your help to build a community around ilumi - the ilumi nation.\nIn addition to your very helpful contribution, we're going to ask you for your advice and opinion before and after we ship ilumi.  When you receive your ilumi, we are going to ask for your feedback.  What bugs are you seeing, what do you like, & what don't you like?\nFurther, we've only touched the surface of what ilumi can do.  With your support you can use the ilumi SDK to come up with even more amazing lighting experiences.  This is just the beginning, and together with your help we'll not only create a great product that we hope you'll love, but one that you've been a part of as a member of the ilumi nation.\nTo give you an idea on where we are in our process and next steps, here's an overview of our timeline:\nThe ilumi team is a combination of entrepreneurs, hackers, designers, and technologists.  The team is led by co-founders Corey Egan and Swapnil Bora out of Dallas, Texas. Swapnil and Corey met as classmates at UT Dallas where they came up with the idea in the fall of 2010 and won the UTD Business Idea competition.  \nilumi at the lab\nCorey & Swapnil at the Tech Fort Worth Impact Awards\nPartners:\nWe've been fortunate to have the help of a number of different great partners both large and small.  To name a few Novation Mobile has done a fantastic job helping us with developing the ilumi app, Avnet Electronics  has helped us from day 1 to source the right components, and Osram Opto has been a great partner providing not only excellent LED components but expertise and access to world class testing facilities. \nteam awards:\nFinalist - Tech Fort Worth Impact Awards, May 2013\nMost Promising Company - Rice Alliance IT & Web Venture Showcase, December 2012\nSemi-finalist - SxSw Eco Start-up Showcase, October 2012\nMost Promising Company \u2013 Rice Alliance CleanTech and Energy Venture Showcase, September 2012\nSemi-finalist - CleanTech Open Accelerator and Competition, June 2012\nGrand Prize - Carnegie Mellon McGinnis Venture Competition, March 2011\nFirst Place Graduate Level - University of Texas at Dallas Business Idea Competition, November 2010\n\n\nFCC certified Bluetooth Low Energy interface with 100+ foot range with 3.5mS connection time\nExtremely fast 16bit, 256KB FLASH processor\nControl for 100+ ilumi bulbs via Bluetooth mesh network with a range extension to tens of thousands of square feet\nExtremely bright and efficient high power LEDs - Red, Green, Blue, & White.

There are many challenges that we've faced and many that are still to come. Here's what's keeping us up at night and what our plans are to address them....\n\nCAN WE MANUFACTURE ILUMI?\nWe've already gone through numerous revisions and 3D printed versions of prototypes to ensure manufacturability. We're also supported by a great team including manufacturers in India & China and Avnet Electronics as a sourcing partner. Of course, standing up a manufacturing operation can be difficult, but we've put in the time and have a great team on it to get the wheels turning.\n\nWHAT ABOUT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY?\nWe've spent a lot of time thinking through how to make ilumi work and work great, and we have filed extensive patents beginning in the spring of 2011. As a precaution, we're also working with larger established lighting players to ensure freedom to operate.\n\nWILL YOU BE ABLE TO DELIVER ON TIME?\nThe good news is that many of the challenges in development are already behind us. Now it's really about making sure that we can make ilumi in volume. We feel good about our timeline, but if anything changes we'll let the ilumi nation know right away.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS AFTER KICKSTARTER?\nWith your help, we're building something that will be in our lives and yours for a long time. With that, our interaction will extend long after shipment. There's lot more we can do with ilumi and will continue to add-in and update features/functionality (over-air firmware updates make this all possible). \nAlso, we want to have a continuous conversation with our supporters. Early feedback with everyone that's using ilumi will help us greatly improve the overall experience for everyone in the ilumi nation. Ultimately, we're in this for the long haul.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #28", "update_userinfo": "Introducing the New ilumi Smartbulb - Limited Quantities from $29 on Kickstarter", "update_content": "Hello ilumi nation!\nWe're thrilled, excited, pumped, elated, and just plain giddy about the launch of an all new ilumi Smartbulb on Kickstarter today!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #27", "update_userinfo": "New ilumi App Update plus 33% Off", "update_content": "Hello ilumi nation!\n  As you know, it\u2019s been quite a journey creating the world\u2019s smartest lights.

Firstly, a couple weeks ago we shipped ilumi to all backers in the America\u2019s, including both the Small A21\u2019s and Large PAR30\u2019s. It\u2019s been great to see pictures from the ilumi nation lighting up their living rooms with their new ilumi Smartbulbs. Also, we greatly appreciate those of you who have reached out to share your experience with ilumi thus far, both positive and negative. It\u2019s extremely helpful to get that feedback, and one of the most beneficial aspects of crowdfunding. Please continue to reach-out, especially if you are experiencing any problems with your Smartbulbs.

We hope you enjoy them and can\u2019t wait to get your feedback. We also know that we still have a long way to go including shipping out the remaining ilumi to all of you across 54 countries and 6 continents. As the next step, 600+ Jet Black A21 ilumi Smartbulbs are now leaving the manufacturing site in India headed for LA and backers in North and South America.

Hopefully, you all caught the episode, but if not we encourage you to check out the episode here. Spoiler alert, the world\u2019s smartest lights just got a whole lot smarter as Dallas\u2019 Billionaire and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban, joined the ilumi nation as an investor.\nTo give you some background, we filmed the segment for Shark Tank last September, and were not able to say anything about it until the episode aired. Also, even though the show didn't include a reference to our backers, you and the ilumi nation were of course a big part of our conversation with the Sharks and a big reason why Mark invested in ilumi. That along with a lot of other footage was simply edited out. What this means is that with you, the ilumi nation, and Mark behind us, ilumi will be even better and shine bright all over the world.
