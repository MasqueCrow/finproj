The game last 4 rounds, each round being divided into 3 phases:\n\n Split & Trap: collect cards and try to trap your opponent.\n Planification: choose the cards you want to build and the ones to recycle in order to develop faster.\n Production: produce resources in a sequential order.\n First, both players draw 7 cards from the Development Deck. The cards are divided into 4 categories:\n Structures (Farm, Outpost, ...)\n Specialists (Scientist, Great Army, ...)\n Monuments (Great Lighthouse, Botanical Gardens, ....)\n Discoveries (Moonbramble forest, Subterranean crystals...)\nThese cards are the means to develop your Duchy, enhance its production and earn victory points.\nIn addition to the 7 cards, you'll add a Calamity card to your hand. It's a strictly negative card that reduces your score at the end of the game.\n\nThen, the Split & Trap phase begins. The active player chooses 2 cards from their hand and place them in the offering areas for their opponent.\n\nEach player has 2 Trap tokens, allowing them to place some cards face down. It gives the opportunity to trick the opponent into taking a calamity. It can also be used to protect important cards the player would like to retrieve.\nThat\u2019s the important guessing part of It's a Wonderful Kingdom. Will you outsmart the opponent and read into their actions so you don\u2019t fall into any trap?\nOnce a player placed 2 cards from his hand on the table, the opponent chooses one of the two offering areas, and collect all the cards there, placing them in their Selection Area.\nThe face down cards must stay face down once collected. Choose wisely! When both players\u2019 hands are empty, they move on to the Planning phase.\n\nDuring this phase, players may recycle some of their collected cards to immediately gain the corresponding resources, and keep other cards to build them for victory points or to enhance the production of the Duchy.\nChoosing which card to keep, and which card to recycle will be key to seize the throne!\nLast, comes the Production phase. \nUnlike in other games, resources will be produced in a precise order in It's a Wonderful Kingdom:\nMaterials (grey)\nPopulation (purple)\nGold (Yellow)\nExploration (blue)\nIf you anticipated this phase well during the Planning phase, you will construct cards in chain. With the right timing, some cards can produce during the very same phase in which they were constructed, hence speeding your development up!\nIt's a Wonderful Kingdom is a Modular game. Several modules are modifying the rules, the interaction, and even the difficulty of your games.\n\nDuring setup, choose one of the available modules. There are 3 standard modules, and 1 additional module in the Legends box:\n Quest: complete tasks to earn rewards.\n Advisors: use unique and powerful abilities to change the course of the game\n Menaces: asymmetrical confrontation using the Menace cards to slow your opponent down.\n Conquest (Legends box only): conquer enemy territories to develop your production and earn additional abilities or bonuses.\nIf you want more details about the gameplay, please download the rulebook hereunder (beta version). \nTaxes will be charged to you by your country if you wish to have your rewards delivered outside of the US, Canada, the EU, the UK, China, Hong-Kong, Macao, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, India, Indonesia and New Zealand,   \nLa boite de jeu is a company founded in 2013.

The estimated delivery date for this project is February 2022, though delays are always a possibility. Due to the logistics of international shipping, some backers may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nLOST SHIPMENTS, LATE SURVEYS & REFUND POLICY\nIf your order is lost or returned due to unforeseen circumstances, we will attempt to reship your game one time, free of charge. If you provided incorrect shipping information, you will be responsible for the reshipment fee. If your order cannot be delivered, we will refund your order completely, including fees.\n\nReshipments and late survey shipments will all be sent out at the same time, about 3 months after the start of fulfillment to simplify the logistics and avoid errors resulting from sending numerous single orders.\n\nThis campaign will close 3 months after the start of fulfillment. If you do not provide shipping information by that time, we can not fulfill your order and your pledge will be kept as a donation to the campaign.\n\nFINAL PRODUCT\nThe final look, materials and content of the rewards are subject to change and may differ from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nCanvas: Reflections will be printed on high quality, durable components. The sleeves that come with the game are not only essential for gameplay, they also help increase the lifespan of the cards. Canvas was designed with expansions in mind, so that Canvas: Reflections and future expansions will not require unnecessary duplicate printing of base game components.\nReusability and recyclability\nOur manufacturer, PandaGM, will produce replacement components so that damaged or missing pieces can be replaced with a small shipment instead of a second copy of the game, saving gas and materials. Canvas components are stored in reusable storage bags. The box efficiently holds all game pieces and add-ons without wasted space from a plastic insert.\nSustainable materials\nThe box and punchboard are made from 30% recycled materials for the ideal blend of durability and sustainability. The cards are made with materials from FSC certified sources. Components are printed with eco-friendly water-based ink and varnish. Our premium components are made from wood instead of plastic. The packing cartons are 100% recycled paper pulp.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nPandaGM recycles all plastic and paper waste. The factory is fully air-conditioned for worker comfort and has passed ISO worker health and safety standards, is BSCI social compliance certified, and follows the OHSAS requirements for occupational health and safety.

After two or three plays, you will even find players overlapping turns for increased efficiency.\nThe game is also highly interactive meaning you are never left disengaged, even in a 4-player game. Plan your next turn, keep an eye on who is close to completing orders or goals or plan the best use of the Exchange Student you have in your hand.\n\n\nAn elegantly integrated upgrade system where each order you complete with a vendor permits you to upgrade one of the 11 upgrade locations on your storehouse/orchard.\nUpgrades increase the efficiency of your owner actions, allow you to plant more trees and increase your resource production efficiency.\nCURRENT STRETCH GOAL \nOne of the more unique elements of our stretch goals we can reveal now is the Artist Boost. As you can find out in the Scrumpy Team section, our extremely talented artist Bernie Todd, who was only 13 when she started this project is still a college student and we want to help her out. Alongside game upgrades and stretch goals for backers we also will be hoping to unlock artist boost levels to provide an additional financial bonus on top of the money she has already been paid, to help her with further education.\n SOCIAL GOALS\n\nThanks to the social efforts of many Scrumpy: Card Cider backers, the game will be coming with Storehouses that are dual-layered with recessed spaces for upgrade cubes and gaps for sliding the cards underneath.\n\nWe completed the 7 social challenges below to unlock this exciting component upgrade FOR FREE.\n(we will not increase the cost of the game on Kickstarter by adding this deluxe component to the base game)\n Click here to go straight to our Facebook launch post \n Click here to go straight to our Facebook page\n  Click here to visit our Instagram page\n  Click here to follow our Kickstarter profile\nClick here to retweet our Twitter Launch tweet.\n Click here and click the \u2764\ufe0f to become a fan of the game\nClick here to subscribe to the Youtube channel\nPLAY\n\nScrumpy is a strategic card game for 1-4 players. The game is played over a maximum of 6 rounds, sometimes fewer. Each round has 2 phases: Actions and Refresh.\nIn the Actions phase, players take turns to perform four Core Actions and optional Auxiliary Actions.\nIn the Refresh phase, the game is reset for the next round unless an End Game Condition has been achieved.\nYour objective is to gain the most Prestige from actions like selling cider, achieving Goals, and recruiting a highly-skilled workforce.\nAUXILIARY ACTION (Optional)\nAt the start of your turn you may perform one of the following auxiliary actions, or pass and move onto your core action:\n Sell cider to a vendor: If you have, in your storehouse, the required bottles or barrels, you may sell to one of the available vendors and also remove an upgrade cube from your storehouse or orchard, placing it on that vendor and receiving coins or prestige.\n Secondary action: all the basic workers in your deck (the cards you start with) have a secondary action - depicted in the top right-hand corner - and they can be converted directly into the resource shown: apple, wood or coin. Simple flip and tuck the card as the resource in question (or discard if gaining a coin from the supply)\n Sell one resource: you can sell one resource by discarding the card and gaining coins equal to its value\nCORE ACTION (Worker)\nAs your core action, you may perform one of the follow three actions:\n Worker Action: play one card from your hand face-up into the first available of the three slots in your storehouse, and perform it's action:\n Recruit: You may recruit one available skilled/master worker from the roster by paying the cost. Play that card into the first available of the three slots in your storehouse, and perform its action.\n Gain Idle Layabout: Gain a grey idle layabout card from the supply for free and play that card into the first available of the three slots in your storehouse. You do not perform an action but you gain a coin.\nCORE ACTION (Owner)\nOnce per round, instead of playing a card, you may move your owner meeple and perform the action selected from the owner's office in your storehouse:\nREFRESH PHASE\nOnce all players have played four actions (3 workers and 1 owner), refresh for the next round:\n Remove your Owner meeple from the Owner Action space it used this round, placing it back on the seat. \nDiscard all Worker cards from the Worker spaces in your Storehouse.\n Refresh your hand according to the hand limits shown on your Storehouse:\n  GAME END\nAfter 6 rounds have been completed, or one player has upgraded all locations on their storehouse (whichever occurs first), the game ends.\nThen, use the Scorepad to calculate final scores by adding up:\nThe value of all Prestige tokens collected during the game.\nThe Prestige of Private and Public Goals achieved.\nThe Prestige of Deliveries to Vendors.\nOne Prestige for each Skilled and Master Worker card in players\u2019 decks.\nOne Prestige for every 8 coins. (Retain any leftover coins in case of a tie break.)\nThe player with the most prestige is the winner.\n*rulebook subject to changes\nNow live on Steam Workshop\n Invincible games have been fortunate enough to have a solo Automa designed by David Digby who also designed Eternal Palace, Tinner's trail and Chocolate Factory solo modes and others. In the Scrumpy: Card Cider solo mode setup is similar to that of a 2-player game but you must make cider as efficiently as possible to avoid the best spots being taken by the solo cidery owner, Anna Vaperson\nDue to ongoing developments of the core game, the solo mode is still in playtesting and development but an early draft rulebook can be downloaded here\nEarly version of Solo rules - subject to change - Requires SOLO AUTOMA cards\n As we transition from hopeful campaign funding to manufacture and fulfilment, there are various tasks that need to be undertaken.\nWe will endeavour to maintain semi-regular updates without you growing fatigued by a full inbox and aiming towards the following targets.\nObviously, with Ships' potential to fail to negotiate canals and global carboard shortages, we cannot anticipate all eventualities but will do our utmost to keep you informed and aware should any delays occur. Any timeline is an estimate only.\nIf they are happening, we reserve the right to sell some copies of the game at UK conventions. We will endeavour to fulfil all copies before this. If there are any delays we may need to begin selling slightly before one or two copies are fulfilled to assist with cash flow. Should you wish to you can always pick up from these conventions if you are yet to receive your copy.\nThe last year has not been kind to board game retailers and we have been hugely supported by a variety of FLGS as we developed Scrumpy. We are happy to offer a Kickstarter retail pledge to any bricks and mortar stores and independent game retailers. Please back at the retail pledge and contact us where we will be happy to share with you our retail rates and see what other things we can do to support you with being able to stock the game. \nWe request: \nyour store's email address and store address\nwhich country you are based in\nyour store's website (if applicable)\nWe reserve the rights to place order limits on Kickstarter copies of games. We are also unwilling to provide copies to anyone offering pre-orders while the campaign is live. \n\nGroup Pledges\nWe want to help as many of you to enjoy Scrumpy as we can. Global shipping can be an issue on this front and so, we are happy for groups of 6 or more people who wish to have the games sent to one location to contact us for a group pledge rate. \nUnfortunately, due to weights and taxes, different locations will have different prices so please contact us to find out how we can work together.\nEstimated shipping cost only\nActual shipping costs may be different from estimates, we will endeavour to secure the best rates possible as close to fulfilment as possible and to pass any savings directly on to backers.\nIn very rare cases the shipping price can be significantly higher than the early estimates. We reserve the right to cancel any order and will offer a full refund in these cases.\n Unfortunately, the law also requires us to pay tax in some countries and we will need to charge VAT or similar taxes at the end of the campaign. For example: In the UK you will need to pay an additional tax of \u00a36.60 VAT. The easiest way to look at this is that MRSP is \u00a340 so the lower pledge will still be below this once you pay VAT. In the US there will be no such tax to pay in many states.\nInvincible Games is a new small independent UK-based publisher that has been formed to produce Scrumpy: Card Cider and - hopefully - many more games to come. We are a small team of only 2 permanent staff members and a handful of freelancers. We have spent the past 4 years developing Scrumpy, investing our own time and money into the project, to get to this point. We're super proud of what we've achieved and sincerely hope you share our love for Scrumpy and join our family as a backer today.\n\nIf you want to find out more about us, check out our team biographies below:\n\nPublisher and Game Designer\nFrom an early age, Paul would often be found immersed in the land of board games, whether he was insisting his mother serve him from a kerplunk tube or taking an age to walk to school as he could only move forward when he rolled a 4 or better.\n  Since Paul first started to develop his ideas for Scrumpy, he has been blessed with a young daughter who takes up a lot of his time in the best ways imaginable. Who wouldn't prefer to be crawling through canvas tunnels with an eleven-month-old than working? \n  Scrumpy has taken 4 years, a pandemic, a daughter and the setting up of a maths teaching Youtube channel to fully develop but Paul is excited to be finally at the stage where is ready to be released into the wild.\n  This is Paul's first global release but he hopes it will not be his last with prototypes about smuggling in Cornwall, a dice school, a floristry game and a Euro game set inside the Hippo Falls safari park just some of the prototypes on his development list.  \n\nPublisher and Head of Art & Graphics\nDenholm began his career in board-gaming working as a general assistant for Stuff By Bez in 2019. He worked extensively on the Kickstarter campaigns for Wibbell++ & Kittycataclysm, whilst also entertaining a successful acting and theatre-producing career. He is also a self-taught graphic designer; board games have been an excellent way for Denholm to hone his skills in an applied setting.  \nDenholm met Paul Frohnsdorff-Harris at HandyCon - a board gaming convention that Paul founded and runs - and their professional relationship grew from there. Initially Denholm came on board as a graphic designer but eventually, the partnership grew and he has since been integral in the development and delivery of this project. \nDenholm also works as a junior developer for Alley Cat Games, leading the development of Paper Dungeons, and assisting on Tinners' Trail and Eternal Palace. His first independent game Dice Cruise being released by Talon Strikes Studios in 2022.\n  Despite her burgeoning talent as an artist. Bernie is still a college student. She first started this project at the age of 13 under the watchful guise and support of her father, himself an artist in the RPG world. \n  Understandably, this is Bernie's first major board game project having only provided support with RPG illustrations. Recently she also got a commission for Typhon, a game setting for a book.\n  Bernie also streams some of her art and gaming on Twitch under the username Jozebean. She would appreciate any increase in followers that she receives.\nPrototype playtesting\nChoosing from a hand of cards\nMid-game prototype play\n Replayability, Global Impact and Sustainability", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have a good working relationship with our manufacturers in China who will be working with us through a company in the UK to assist with a punctual and high-quality response.\n\nAs with any Kickstarter project, unpredictable events can take place. Global events such as the pandemic have affected everything from Manufacture and Shipping to the availability of cardboard. The estimated delivery date allows some extra time to account for delays, but it can only ever be an estimate.\n\nWhatever happens, we will keep backers in the loop via project updates, and rewards will be delivered, as soon as we are able.\n\nAbove all we are human and while the best attempt will be made to deliver a wonderful product to you promptly and of the best quality, mistakes may happen.

Not anymore! We are presenting new collaborative and peaceful competitive expansions that will add a new meaning to survival.\nBoard Royale is about to become a truly sandbox game that can be played by all types of players and playstyles!\nYES, we are talking about wild beasts, the army of the dead, and secret agendas.\nLet\u2019s get to know the Board Royale base game and our new expansions!\nWhat did we change?\nWe're excited to announce that we have updated our base game with several changes. Thanks to our previous backers and all players around the world for their amazing feedback. With their guidance, we've added new items to increase our base game item count from 80 to 100. New weapons, fun disguise items, and a more balanced Board Royale Experience for all. If you already have a base game please check out the returning backer section for the included base game update package.\n\nBoard Royale became an adventure beyond our imaginations.  Another shout out to our all previous backers and players around the world! Thank you, for constantly reminding us to add a collaborative gameplay experience. We've heard your call. We waited until we're completely satisfied with the expansion tests.\nClick to download on the App Store\nClick to download on the Google Play\nSurvival 101: This pack is perfect if you want to have a taste of the original Board Royale before you commit to the expansions.

If you have the base game in your hands and want to add our new expansions, this pack is made for you. They will all fit in our Kickstarter exclusive box.

Our new base game, four previous expansions, five new expansions plus a mini travel backpack. All inside one giant box that can store all cards sleeved!\nCollector's Edition: Our Collector\u2019s Edition is truly a piece of craftsmanship. The box is huge and covered with vegan leather. Inside, there is a soft velvety texture housing our new base game and our four previous and five new expansions. There were only 250 Collector\u2019s Editions declared for Board Royale - The Island. 150 of them were given previously. In this campaign, the last 100 are available for you to grab. All serial numbers are individually engraved on the boxes.\n We have created all our offerings as add-ons so that you can customize your pledge as you please. You can add these now on Kickstarter after selecting your reward or just after the campaign from our pledge manager BackerKit.\nUpgrade your box to Survival Crate: One of the most requested items has been a box that can easily store all our cards sleeved!

The Sunset Over Water stretch goals & campaign maintained that bar. For Floriferous we've decided to simply build the game we hope / believe should be delivered from the get go. All of the \"Stretch Goals\" are already unlocked and included upon funding.\nInternational shipping has been increasingly complicated and expensive year after year, including additional requirements to deliver EU, UK, and CA Friendly service.  We fully expect to see additional increases to shipping. If you are able to purchase an additional copy or copies with some friends, you'll have a better price per copy on shipping.

Get Me Off This Planet!\", \"The Siblings Trouble\", \"GemPacked Cards\", \"Heroes and Tricks\", \"Herbaceous\", \"Legendary Creatures\", \"Sunset Over Water\", \"Herbaceous Sprouts\", \"Heroes Welcome, \"Skulk Hollow,\" \"The One Hundred Torii,\" and \"The Whatnot Cabinet\" all successfully funded and shipped to backers. \"Herbaceous: Pocket Edition\" is shipping to backers in April. We strive to run excellent Kickstarters and deliver fantastic products.\n\n\"Floriferous\" is well-tested and balanced. The graphic design is complete and the card art is final. Box and instructions are near final and we have been working closely with our printer. Limited amounts of work will remain based on how the KS unfolds.\n\nThere are inherent risks whenever undertaking a project as complex and large as producing and distributing a board game, but we have over 6 years of experience dealing with these. We've gone out of our way to surround ourselves with experienced board game developers, distributors, and people who have run and launched successful Kickstarters. This team of friends has been exceedingly supportive and we're sure will help as we hit any upcoming bumps in the road. And there are bumps. Strikes, shortages, and shipping delays are all hard to predict.\n\nMost importantly, if something does go wrong, we will keep everyone in the loop as the project moves forward and comes to market. This game will exist because you all will have made it happen.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Floriferous", "descp": "Receive one copy of this relaxing game & the mini-expansion.\nShip: US $8, CA/EU/UK $12, AU/NZ $16, WW $18\nINCLUDES:\nFloriferous\nEarly Spring Mini-Expansion", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,367 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "Floriferous Duo", "descp": "Receive two copies of this relaxing game & two mini-expansions.\nShip: US $10, CA/EU/UK $14, AU/NZ $20, WW $30\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 Floriferous\n2\u00d7 Early Spring Mini-Expansion", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["85 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "Flowers & Herbs", "descp": "Receive one copy of Floriferous & Herbaceous with their mini-expansions.\nShip: US $10, CA/EU/UK $14, AU/NZ $20, WW $30\nINCLUDES:\nFloriferous\nEarly Spring Mini-Expansion\nHerbaceous\nFlavor Pack Mini-Expansion", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["148 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "Flowers & Sunrises", "descp": "Receive one copy of Floriferous & Sunset Over Water with their mini-expansions.\nShip: US $10, CA/EU/UK $14, AU/NZ $20, WW $30\nINCLUDES:\nFloriferous\nEarly Spring Mini-Expansion\nSunset Over Water\nNature's Muse Mini-Expansion", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["204 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "Nature's Bounty: Flor, Herb, Sunset", "descp": "Receive one copy of Floriferous, Herbaceous, & Sunset Over Water with their mini-expansions.\nShip: US $12, CA/EU/UK $18, AU/NZ $24, WW $36\nINCLUDES:\nFloriferous\nEarly Spring Mini-Expansion\nHerbaceous\nFlavor Pack Mini-Expansion\nSunset Over Water\nNature's Muse Mini-Expansion", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["261 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "Floriferous Trio", "descp": "Receive three copies of Floriferous & three mini-expansions.\nShip: US $12, CA/EU/UK $18, AU/NZ $24, WW $36\nINCLUDES:\n3\u00d7 Floriferous\n3\u00d7 Early Spring Mini-Expansion", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["21 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 80 or more", "title": "Floriferous Quadro", "descp": "Receive four copies of Floriferous & four mini-expansions.\nShip: US $14, CA/EU/UK $20, AU/NZ $28, WW $40\nINCLUDES:\n4\u00d7 Floriferous\n4\u00d7 Early Spring Mini-Expansion", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["3 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 120 or more", "title": "Nature's Bounty: Flor, Herb, Sunset Duo", "descp": "Receive two copies each of Floriferous, Herbaceous, & Sunset Over Water with their mini-expansions.\nShip: US $18, CA/EU/UK $30, AU/NZ $42, WW $60\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 Floriferous\n2\u00d7 Early Spring Mini-Expansion\n2\u00d7 Herbaceous\n2\u00d7 Flavor Pack Mini-Expansion\n2\u00d7 Sunset Over Water\n2\u00d7 Nature's Muse Mini-Expansion", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["6 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #7", "update_userinfo": "June Update: Manufacturing Underway!", "update_content": "Team Awesome,\nAs always, I hope everyone is well!\n   "}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #6", "update_userinfo": "May Update: Files Prepped & Ready", "update_content": "Team Awesome,\nI hope everyone is having a chance to start enjoying the spring!

You will find that materialization engaging, and even delightful.\nDoce is a unique abstract strategy game. It's a turn-based, two-player game. And now you can play it anywhere in the world, with an Internet connection.\nTake turns placing dice on the playing grid with the goal of making a line of 4 dice that add up to 12, but you have to follow some unique rules that will definitely pose a challenge to even the most astute among you. It's a game of simple rules and at the same time very challenging and fun to play. The complexity, possibilities, and strategies can run very deep.

We believe this is of great advantage for everybody, especially for people who want to get a mental power up! \nThis is one of our Doce Digital designs\nDoce Classic has been played by enthusiasts since its successful Kickstarter campaign at the end of 2019.

For us, we've decided to bring forward the development of DOCE Digital, the perfect complement of Doce Classic.\nWe, the Smart Iguana Games Team, have been working tirelessly on the Doce Digital Beta version of our DOCE Classic board game. We hope it becomes a wonderful resource for people all over the world: a fun, challenging, and engaging game that can be played with the safest of social distances.\nWe believe in the importance of giving our backers the opportunity to try the game with friends before committing to a pledge. The BETA version represents an essential piece on the road towards our goal and it's 100% operational for you to play and enjoy (check the link to the game right after the How-to-play video section).

Some mind-blowing challenges to power up your neurons. The program will verify your answer and tell you the solution. Want to test your move? Play it against the AI.\n[VOICE-ACTIVATED PLAY MODE]\nThough this can be used by any player, this feature will be specially developed and implemented for the vision impaired. They will be able to speak out loud their command and move and hear back a synthesized voice with the move played by the opponent, like the computer. The contender will have the option to play normally or using this feature. Languages will be added progressively. A very good friend motivated us to include this feature.\n[TIMERS]\nNot enough time to wait for an eternity for your opponent to make their move? These timers will do the job. As with chess clocks, you will be able to set and limit the playing time for each player. \n[GAME NOTATIONS]\nThis option will allow you to save your games and replay them or any other game in the database. You will be able to analyze your games and improve your skills.\n[PRACTICE MODE]\nIn this mode, you'll be able to analyze variations of the gameplay and test them against the computer.\n[ADVANCED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE]\nWe'll take the computer AI to the next level with a self-learning algorithm to improve single-player gameplay.\n[TOURNAMENT MODE]\nThis feature will make Doce Digital an App. Here you will be able to create different types of tournaments, the program will take care of the matching, positions, scoring, and more. It may include prizes, tournament subscriptions, and/or purchases if applicable. You will enjoy this feature with your friends, family, and whoever you want to invite.\n[NEW GAME MECHANICS]\nFor those who like to have different options for gameplay, and like a little bit of luck, we will add new ways of playing. Like Dice Luck, where the player must roll a set of dice during their turn, let's say three, and they have to play one of those rolled dice.\nNote: remember that with the Doce Digital All-inclusive reward you will have access to all these features as they get developed and implemented, even if their stretch goal is not reached in this campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2665 REVIEWS \u2665 \nGAMETYRANT:\n Devon Norris written review \n\nThe Meeple Guild - Yorkton this week\n\n\nSmart Iguana Games is a start-up, family-owned, and operated business in Ocala, Florida, and all around the world.

See below for detailed information about shipping.\nCrafting Arzium is a new documentary feature film about board game designer Ryan Laukat and his wife Malorie Laukat (the core team behind Red Raven Games). Follow the two creators as they attempt to bring their latest game called Now or Never to life!\nWhat is Arzium? Arzium is the world setting of many of Red Raven\u2019s games, including Near and Far, Above and Below, and Roam\u2013among others. Arzium is a fantastical world filled with desert oases, lush pastures, turnip farms, amber mines, jagged mountains, glogos caverns, iron cities, and exotic flying continents! It is a world which has entertained and inspired thousands of gamers and which captures the imagination.\nThe idea for Crafting Arzium came about after the completion of The Game Designers documentary (our first project) and was directly inspired by that movie.\n\nIn The Game Designers we set out to capture as much as we possibly could about the world of modern board game design and we traveled near and far to collect numerous stories and interviews. We followed five main designers and interviewed over 70+ people in total. The result of that effort was a film that was far-reaching and touched on a lot of points regarding the subject.\n\nFor Crafting Arzium we thought that it would be fun to delve into the same topic, however, instead of casting a really wide net like we did last time, we wondered how \u201cdeep\u201d we could go with just one individual. So we set out in our early pre-production stage and made a long list of designers who we potentially thought could work for the film. Over time the list got shorter and shorter (for different reasons) and we eventually decided to team up with Ryan and Malorie Laukat!\nCollaborating with Ryan and Malorie was great from the start and has continued to be a great experience. For this film we wanted to find the right individuals who were willing to be open and honest about their challenges\u2013both in regards to the games they made and also in real life matters. Ryan and Malorie were up to the task and have opened up and shared a lot of great information\u2013which really shines through in the film.\n\nRyan and Malorie are also super talented. They bring a great passion and sensibility to every project they create and have inspired gamers for nearly a decade. It was for this reason that we also decided to make a film about them!\n\"Working with Eric on Crafting Arzium has been an exciting adventure, and it's been very gratifying to be involved. Eric puts so much heart and effort into the work he does. It's thrilling to see what he can create from the simple story of making board games. He has really captured the passion we feel about our work, and the challenges of our everyday life. We are so pleased to support Eric and hope you will too!\"\n\n- Ryan and Malorie Laukat\nCrafting Arzium began filming in June of 2020 and we hope to complete all of the filming by summer 2021. We have edited approximately one hour of the movie thus far (February 2021) and hope to have the film completed shortly after our last day of filming. The film is currently in a rough-cut status and needs to address some outstanding items, including:\n\nFilming the last few scenes\nEditing the last few scenes\nRevising the rough cut for optimal character/plot development\nRefining the rough cut and locking in the final edit\nAdding in more graphics from the world of Arzium\nAdding in more animations from the world of Arzium\nAdding in more music to nail the tone of the film\nAdding opening and closing sequences\nAdding \"lower-thirds\" (text to the film)\nBalancing audio and building a clean aural experience\nPurchasing music licenses\nColor Correction\nImage stabilization\nQuality Control\n\nWith the funds raised from this Kickstarter, we can finish off these outstanding items for the movie and also complete all of the stretch goals. This has been a great project to work on and we want to deliver an awesome experience for all backers--with your help we can do just that!\nAll shipping to the US is free of charge.\n\nInternational shipping for physical reward tiers ($33 and up): We ship to European Union, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia ONLY.  It is a $30 USD flat fee for shipping to these locations and this shipping charge includes all charges (no additional charges will be added for things such as customs, duties, and taxes per region and/or country). Shipping for physical tiers ($33 and up) is not available for anywhere outside of US, EU, UK, Canada, and Australia, at present time.\n\nShipping for ALL add-ons is free of charge regardless of where you live. And we will ship add-ons to anywhere in the world (for digital reward tiers).\nATTENTION! For shares to count toward the share goals above, you must share this post here: Click here to visit the Official Facebook post!\nThe Game Designers was our first documentary project and was successfully funded on Kickstarter in March 2018 (view the Kickstarter here). We had a lot of great support from the community and we unlocked nearly all of the stretch goals. The Game Designers went on to be released on iTunes, Google Play, Amazon, and Vimeo.\nThe Game Designers followed the stories of five board game designers as they worked to develop their latest games. Numerous other designers were interviewed for the project as well and they informed and highlighted specific things about the journeys of the main characters. In total, over 70+ game designers, industry professionals, and other media personalities were interviewed for the project.\nYou can learn more about the The Game Designers at the official website or check out the official trailer.  The Game Designers was a huge passionate project--just like Crafting Arzium--and we really appreciated the help and support of the community to help bring it to life. We hope that you will enjoy it should you get a reward or add-on that includes the movie!\nHi, my name is Eric Rayl. I am the founder of Zoom Out Media and also the writer/director of Crafting Arzium (and The Game Designers). As you might have noticed, I am passionate about board games and movies! I like to tell fun and entertaining stories about different types of creative people and to share their journeys. And so I am super excited to bring Crafting Arzium to the world and to show the awesome talent of Ryan & Malorie Laukat.\nDirector Eric Rayl filming a greenscreen shot with Ryan.\nYou can learn more about Zoom Out Media at our website or visit us on YouTube, Facebook, or Instagram!\nWe would love to have your support in helping us to spread the word about Crafting Arzium! We can only reach so many people by ourselves and we need YOU to help us get the word out there. We don't want anyone who plays tabletop games, or anyone who loves documentaries such as this, to miss out on this Kickstarter simply because they weren't aware of it. Can we count on you in helping us to share the project with your friends and family--and also on social media? Would you share the project so that more people can learn about the movie? Thank you so much!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe believe that the risks for this project are relatively low. About 90% of the footage for the project has already been shot and we are on target to get the rest of the film shot by the end of summer 2021. However, with all things related to film production, there are always surprises that can pop up at any time, so we will try to work through anything like that if it shall so arise.

However, battery capacity is not keeping pace with the power demands of gaming, apps and advanced technologies like 5G. Unfortunately for users, this means carrying more chargers and backup batteries while on the go.\nLow-battery anxiety is real and it keeps getting worse every day!\nThe only real solution is to have a compact, portable fast-charging power bank to reliably power up all the devices you use daily. It has to work fast, travel light, and fit seamlessly into your lifestyle!\n\nSTORM 2 provides a whole new charging experience unlike any other power bank.\nIts Cyberpunk style transparent case marks the new era of power banks.

It is compact, cost-efficient, and the perfect battery station to take anywhere in the world.\n Adjustable DC Output \nA dedicated 3.3-25.2V adjustable & customizable DC barrel port output meets all your specific device charging needs.

Take STORM 2 with you and leave all your other chargers at home.\nFully Recharge STORM 2 in Just 1.5 Hours\nLarger battery capacity doesn\u2019t mean a longer recharge time. With its 100W PD fast-charging DC input, there is no need to panic when your STORM 2 needs to recharge. Just 1.5 hours is enough to fully charge its 27600mAh/99.36Wh capacity.\n\nUse It While Charging\nThe pass-through capability provides users with more charging convenience.

You'll play tricks to each time period as you try to outwit your fellow travelers and collect enough wreaths to decorate all the holiday doors.\n\nGhosts of Christmas is a new version of the acclaimed hard-to-find Japanese game \"Time Palatrix\" by Taiki Shinzawa. Have you ever played \"spades\" or \"hearts\" and thought \"I wish this game had time travel?\"\nAll in a small 5 x 5 x 2 inch box\n\nGhosts of Christmas is a trick taking game where you play cards into three separate tricks: past, present, and future. You visit all three locations in a single round, and winning tricks in one time period could help you win more in the future!\n\nThe gameplay remains the same, but with a new optional variant for a more relaxed game.\nTwelve colorful characters inspired by A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens.\n\nClick to view pdf. (This is a draft, not a final version.)\nTaylor is an avid player of trick taking games and has a YouTube channel dedicated to them. Ghosts of Christmas can sound confusing at first, but Taylor does a great job explaining how it all works.\nPlease Note: Prototype components are shown in the video. The final version will have some minor changes.\n\nAlso please note: This is one of the most creative Kickstarter preview videos we've ever seen. Give it a chance. You won't be disappointed.\n#1 Meeeaty - Some trick taking games are relaxing affairs. Play your highest card and hope for the best. In Ghosts of Christmas, there are multiple ways to approach each round and use brain cells.\n#2 Ripple Effects - When you don't have the cards to win in a straightforward way, sometimes you can engineer a change in who wins the \"Past\" trick in order to make the \"Present\" and \"Future\" trick work out better for you.\n#3 Dials - They're both fun and informative. A great visual way for everyone to keep track of which suit they can play to each ghost.\n#4 Different Variants/Difficulty Levels - If you want a more low stress evening (or you are just learning), play the variant without bidding. If you think you've mastered the game, try playing one of the TWO variants with the \"Beyond\" ghost that add even more options.\n#5 Bidding Options - Speaking of bidding, the ability to place an \"exact bid\" or a \"wiggle room bid\" gives you the option to play it safe or really go for that high score each round. \n#6 Small Box - It's a fact. Games in smaller boxes take up less room on your shelf, get taken to more game nights, and get played more. This is a small box game. (We work to keep even our \"big boxes\" pretty small.)\n\nPut on your hard hat and install factory tiles in this fast, furious and fun game of factory planning. Connect your tiles to build the best possible production chains. Whoever makes the most profitable factory wins!\nEfficiently packed into our 10.8 x 6.8 x 2.75 inch box\nLike Ghosts of Christmas, we're republishing this cult-classic by Corn\u00e9 van Moorsel because it deserves a wider audience. The gameplay will stay the same (if it ain't broke...), but it has brand new art.\n\nOur Touch:\n1. Added a sixth player\n2. Official variant to play without the quick grab element. Details TBD but will definitely be a part of the game.\n3. Added unique names and logos to each of the six company boards and score tokens to make the game more thematic and improve accessibility for color blind players.\n\nPlay solo, with a full table of six players, or anywhere in between.\nWhat's your favorite machine name?\n\nIt's a puzzle, but not a jigsaw puzzle. Like a \"How am I going to connect all of these? Did you just take the machine I wanted? I have no use for blue! Let's play again. I think I get it now.\" kind of puzzle.\nUnique names improve theming and accessibility\nClick to view pdf. (This is a draft, not a final version.)\nPlease Note: The game shown in this review is the original Factory Funner. Our version has the same gameplay, but all new artwork, and support for a 6th player.\n#1 Quick grabbing is rewarded - This game doesn't have analysis paralysis. When the machines are flipped over at the start of the turn, you have to decide which one you want. Too slow and someone will take your machine. Too fast and you will grab one that you thought would work ... but didn't.\n#2 Non-real-time variant - What about groups who don't like that real-time part of the game? We really think that is the best way to play, but we realize it isn't a fun or even possible option for everyone. We're including an alternative rule that removes all the speed elements and is still fun (in a different way).\n#3 Making it work - At some point during your game, someone at the table will be quiet for 30 seconds. Then they will announce, \"I think I can make it work.\" Pipes start getting laid. Reservoirs are moved around. The table will laugh at how ridiculous their factory looks. And in a few turns you will know if what they did was smart or short sighted.\n#4 You Will Improve - You might not be good at this game the first time you play it. You will get better. You will learn. You will overcome. And it will be rewarding.\n#5 Bad Grammar - Factory FunNER is the sequel and a very solid improvement to Factory Fun. It uses hexes instead of squares to allow more creative building, and some subtle improvements to scoring, length, and machine placement rules really improve things.\n#6 Solo Mode - You can play this game by yourself. Never know when that might come in handy.\n#7 On Tour - Factory Funner has a lot of similarities to our other game \"On Tour\".  It shares the roller coaster emotions and intuitive gameplay.  Whether you're building an optimized route, or installing the most efficient machines, you'll feel the same tension and joy of making it all work out.\n\nNote: Our game will NOT be an exact duplicate from these reviews, but the core gameplay will stay the same.\nZee Garcia's Kickstarter Pick of the Week | Dice Tower\nTurn into a high-flying stock trader as you work against the other players to control the market, buy and short stock, and make the most money.\nHave you been pumping cash into GameStop? Want to have the fun of making big bets without risking real cash?\nYou're going to thoroughly enjoy this brand new game that will bring you into the exciting and crazy world of buying and shorting stocks.\n*No financial knowledge required\n** Really does play within 60 minutes \nOur standard box size: 10.8 x 6.8 x 2 inch\nBear Raid is designed by Ryan Courtney, the same mind behind two other mind-bending games, Pipeline and Curious Cargo.\nThese are four of the character you can play as. What should the other two be? Leave your ideas in the comments.\nFor those who are wondering about the name, Bear Raid is a real phrase used to describe when a stock price is intentionally lowered through short selling and rumors.\nClick to view pdf. (This is a draft, not a final version.)\nPlease Note: The game in this video is a prototype and the final version will have some adjustments.\n\nAlso Please Note: We're super excited that Jac, who does not normally make board game videos, agreed to do one for Bear Raid since she's the most passionate person in the world about this game. She is responsible for getting Chad (Owner of BoardGameTables.com) to play Bear Raid and ultimately publish it. Part of Kickstarter is authenticity, so we wanted you to hear from a real fan.\nLater during the campaign, Chad will be interviewing Ryan Courtney about some of the different strategies in Bear Raid. We will post that here after the interview.\nSubmit a fake news headline and win a copy of the game!\nWe're hosting a contest over on Reddit.com/r/BoardGames where you can submit some ideas for a fake headline that will be used for one of the forecast cards in the game!\nEnter today! \u2192\n#1 Shorting Stock - Not many games let you do this. It is so much fun to short stock and then drive the stock down.\n#2 42 Dice & Event Interaction - Not a lot of luck (but some luck). 48 dice. It is a lot. It's not just a matter of chucking dice and moving the prices. Each company has dice, and they interact with different \"event cards\" every turn. It's a cool mechanic that lets you get a glimpse of what might happen next turn, but not a perfect picture.\n#3 Controlling What's Rolled - Not all the dice are rolled. You can influence what gets rolled. Leave dice on a company or take them back. Leave dice behind your screen or add them to the bag. These decisions are just as important as buying or shorting the stock.\n#4 Unspoken Alliances - There's not negotiation. But sometimes you will find you can go further if you and a \"partner\" work together. Maybe one person can't bankrupt a company by themselves, but two people working together can. Just watch out. Most partners want to do about 40% of the work and leave the other 60% for you.\n#5 Quick - Many financial/economic games are long, but Bear Raid packs all that action into 60 minutes.\n#6 Q.E. - Although our other financial game QE is certainly a different game, we really enjoy the genre. We think great financial board games are really under-the-radar. Wouldn't you agree?\n#7 Surprisingly Funny - You expect silly games to be funny. You don't expect a stock market game to have humor in both the gameplay and player's reactions to it. You could almost call it a party game.\n#7 Bears - Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica.\nSave 25% off the future MSRP!\nFor the gamers who want the absolute best from every game, you're in luck!\nWood components for the most handled pieces of Ghosts of Christmas and Bear Raid feel better in your hand.

Clash of Deck is a card game which has been played and tested by hundreds of players throughout its first year of existence, as a French version. The game was published in 2020 in an atypical form: cards you cut yourself from a folded sheet of cardboard. A new standalone expansion was published each month. \nToday, thanks to the feedback and support of its community of players, Clash of Deck takes off with a new edition, available in English. The game will have more conventional components, such as \"real\" cards, larger and of better quality, with a tuck box. \nThe game will be fully translated in English and French!

We recommend the Draft format for your first plays. Each turn, the players draft cards from a common deck to build themselves an efficient deck. For the Draft format, you only need one copy of the Starter Kit. The Constructed format is destined for experts who've mastered the game's mechanisms and the synergies brought by special abilities. Players build their own decks by choosing 10 cards among all the cards from the game. Their opponent will banish two of those cards at the beginning of the game, to form the final 8-cards deck. For the Constructed format, each player must have a copy of the Starter Kit.\nEach player receives a \u201cWatchtower/Stronghold\u201d card. \nPlace the 2 \u201cBridge\u201d cards in the play area. \nShuffle all the other cards into a draw pile. \nThen, reveal the top 4 cards of the draw pile. First, player A chooses 1 of the 4 available cards. Then, player B chooses 2 of the 3 remaining cards. Finally, player A takes the last remaining card. Repeat the operation, but this time, player B chooses the first card. Repeat until each player has 8 cards. Each player shuffles their cards, constituting their hand. They then place their \u201cWatchtower\u201d card in the leftmost place in their hand.\nThe player who crossed a bridge last becomes the first player. For their first turn, they begin the game with only 6 Mana.\nPlayers play their turn one after another. A turn consists of 3 phases:\nPhase 1 \u2013 Mana Regeneration:\nThe player gains as much Mana as the number of cards in their hand (including the \u201cWatchtower/Stronghold\u201d card). Mana is used to pay cards costs. The player can use it during phase 2.\nPhase 2 \u2013 Summoning:\nThe player can spend the Mana gained during phase 1 to play cards from their hand. A player can only play the 4 leftmost cards in their hand (ignoring the \u201cWatchtower / Stronghold\u201d card). \nA card\u2019s Mana cost is indicated in their upper left corner. Mana that isn\u2019t spent during a turn is lost. A player cannot spend more Mana than they gained during their previous phase 1. The play area consists of two lanes. When playing a card, the player chooses in which lane to place it. \nPlayers only summon units in their respective Realm: player A places their card on the left of the \u201cBridge\u201d cards and player B places their cards on the right of the \u201cBridge\u201d cards. There is no limit to the number of cards in a lane. A summoned unit is placed from the player\u2019s hand in the play area, face up, in the lane of their choice, behind their other units already in play. The card remains in play as long as it isn\u2019t destroyed.\nPhase 3 \u2013 Assault:\nA unit has Health Points (HP), and an Attack Value (ATK). A unit cannot attack the turn it enters play. Each unit a player controls inflicts their ATK value to an opposing unit. Units automatically activate in a predetermined order: first the upper lane, from the unit further away from to the unit closest to the \u201cBridge\u201d; then, the lower lane, from the unit further away from to the unit closest to the \u201cBridge\u201d. \nWhen a unit suffers at least as much damage as its HP value, the unit is destroyed. It suffers the entirety of the damage caused by the attack and the card returns to its owner\u2019s hand, in the rightmost place.\nThen, move all the units on the lane closer to the \u201cBridge\u201d so they fill the gap. Units regenerate their HP at the end of the turn. During an assault, a unit inflicts its ATK value to the closest opposing unit on the same lane. If no opposing unit can be attacked, the unit then inflicts its damage directly to the opponent\u2019s \u201cWatchtower/Stronghold\u201d.\nWhen a \u201cWatchtower/Stronghold\u201d suffers damage, shift it that many places to the right in the player\u2019s hand. \nWhen a \u201cWatchtower\u201d reaches the rightmost place in a player hand, it is destroyed: flip it to its \u201cStronghold\u201d side and return it to the leftmost place in the player\u2019s hand. Excess damage inflicted to the \u201cWatchtower\u201d does not carry over to the \u201cStronghold\u201d. When a \u201cStronghold\u201d card reaches the rightmost place in a player\u2019s hand, that player loses the game.\nEnd of the game\nThe game ends as soon as a \u201cStronghold\u201d card reaches the rightmost place in a player\u2019s hand. Their opponent then wins the game.\nThe Solo Mode allows you to play Clash of Deck alone, through a Quick play or a Custom play.  Before playing custom games, we recommend you practice with a few Quick games to learn and discover the rules and the peculiarities of Clash of Deck\u2019s solo mode.

The game evokes the feeling of visiting Amsterdam with friends and experiencing the Dutch culture. Gift of Tulips features artwork inspired by the blue and white delftware pattern that is unique to the Netherlands, the windmills and waterways of the countryside, the flower fields of Keukenhof, and the buildings of Amsterdam.  \nWhen I visited Amsterdam and the Netherlands, I really felt like I was coming home for the first time in my life.  With Gift of Tulips, I wanted to create a game that exemplified my wonderful experience.\nBuild your bouquet, gift tulips to your friends, and create a beautiful Festival display in this gorgeous card game for 2-6 players.\nRead the review https://www.pudgycatgames.com/post/gift-of-tulips\nGift of Tulips Overview\nIn Gift of Tulips, tulip enthusiasts explore Amsterdam\u2019s Tulip Festival to build colorful bouquets and give tulips to their friends.\nPlayers choose between building up their bouquet to try to score major points in the end game Tulip Festival, giving tulips to other players' bouquets for immediate points, and placing tulips in the Tulip Festival to adjust each type's ranking. Each turn, players draw one Tulip card, take an action, then draw another Tulip card and take a different action.\nGame Setup\nGift of Tulips starts with two tulips in the Festival, then players are each dealt two Tulip cards.  Players choose which will start their bouquet and which to place into the Hidden Showcase that may affect the end game Tulip Festival. \nGifting Tulips\nYou can choose to gift a tulip to another player. You gain the value of the tulip given, plus additional points based on the type's current rank in the Festival.\nKeeping Tulips\nYou can choose to keep a tulip for your own bouquet. If you keep a tulip that is ranked 3, 4, or is currently unranked, you will also gain points.\nAdding to the Festival\nThe last choice is to add the Tulip to the Festival.  You can change how the Tulips are currently ranked by adding the Tulip straight to the Festival OR choose to add it to the Hidden Showcase for a chance to influence the ranks at the end of the game.\nGame End\nAt the end of the game, up to 5 Tulips from the Hidden Showcase are added to the Tulip Festival, adjusting the final ranking. Points are awarded to the players that have the most cards of each Tulip type. The player with the most points wins! \nRules and Print and Play\nThe rules are here:  Rules Link (the rules are not final)\nA low-res print and play is here:  Print and Play Link  (this does not feature final artwork, graphic design, or balancing)\nYou can also try the game out on TTS: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2405647152&result=1\nAnd Tabletopia:  https://tabletopia.com/games/gift_of_tulips\nWatch the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpiM2HzDZMQ&feature=youtu.be\nRead the Review: https://thecardboardcantina.com/gift-of-tulips/\nRead the review https://whatsericplaying.com/2021/03/01/gift-of-tulips/\nWatch the video below\nWatch the review: https://youtu.be/TxoPTIRtQDU\nRead the Review: http://www.purplephoenixgames.com/gift-of-tulips-preview/\nWatch the video below\nWatch the review below!\nRead the review: https://www.meeplemountain.com/reviews/gift-of-tulips-review-a-beautiful-bouquet-give-or-take-a-tulip/\nWatch the Video Here https://youtu.be/qcW9Wh9RscM\nWatch the video below!\nPeople sometimes wonder why they should back a Kickstarter campaign instead of waiting to get the game later in retail. The most important reason not to wait with Gift of Tulips is that even if Gift of Tulips funds, we currently don't know if Gift of Tulips will go into distribution. If you wait, you may end up missing out, as we won\u2019t have many extra copies to sell and unless your local store backs the campaign, they won\u2019t be carrying it either.\n Kickstarter Limited \u2013 Gift of Tulips might be very hard to find after the campaign, outside of select conventions. \n Help Us Improve Gift of Tulips \u2013 We have a ton of stretch goals planned to help improve the game for everyone!\nMost importantly, without you, Gift of Tulips would not get created.\nGift of Tulips is a game we truly love and want to share with the world. We've worked on this game for years to make it perfect for you. Gift of Tulips has definitely been a labor of love, as we tried to recreate the experience of visiting Amsterdam and finding a place to belong. We love playing and know you will, as well.\nWe really appreciate your support in making our dream a reality.\nWe would love to support game stores by offering the Kickstarter versions of Gift of Tulips to retailers during the campaign. Back the project at the retailer level for $45, and we'll contact you closer to when we ship out rewards to get a count of games that you wish to get! An invoice will be sent to you before we ship your rewards.\nShipping is estimated to be $10 for retailers in the US, $15 for retailers in the EU, $25 for retailers outside the US and EU.\n\nSocial Goals\nHelp us reach six out of the eight social goals, and we'll add a Best Friend (name subject to change) card to the game! If we meet all eight goals, we'll include a special surprise, as well!\nHere's the links: BGG Page (Sign in to your account, then click the heart button), Facebook, Facebook post, Twitter, Twitter tweet, Instagram, Subreddit, Youtube Channel, and Facebook Group.\nWe will be charging shipping after the campaign ends and subsidizing some of the cost. This ensures you get charged the shipping you deserve. No more, no less.\nBy doing this, we are able to factor in your pledge tier, add-ons, and all fancy things that may occur during the campaign. However, we can offer estimated shipping costs. Below is estimated pricing for one copy of the game.\nPlease keep in mind these are estimates and there can be slight variations from country to country. Also, the more items you purchase, the more shipping will cost. If you have any questions, please email us at contact@weirdgiraffegames.com.\n*We are currently not planning to ship to the following areas: Mexico, Brazil, and Russia.\nTo order a second copy of Gift of Tulips, add an additional $15 to your pledge with no additional shipping cost.\nWe are happy to discuss group orders, but these need to be handled on a country-by-country basis. Please send us a direct message including country and number of copies to discuss.\nGift of Tulips is the eighth project by Weird Giraffe Games.\nWeird Giraffe Games was founded to create games that are easy to learn and play, but layered with strategy.\nThe Gift of Tulips team is made of the following people:\nWe're looking forward to talking to you throughout this Kickstarter and after!

There was something about the place that just felt like home, even though I\u2019d never been there before. It reminded me of visiting my Dutch grandparents, with the blue and white delftware patterns, wooden clogs, tulips, and windmills. I remember growing up and knowing that if someone had a windmill in their yard, they were family, and going to Amsterdam definitely left its mark on me. \nIt wasn\u2019t just the objects I remembered from my childhood, but all the sights as well. From the canals to the fascinating, detailed, and sometimes outlandish architecture, there was something that caught your eye wherever you went. But going even further, the culture also greatly resonated with me. Most people in the Netherlands speak at least Dutch and English, but a good amount of them also speak French, German, and/or Spanish, as well. Historically, a lot of the Dutch people were traders and wanted to speak to you in the language that you were familiar with. It\u2019s that sort of attention to detail and empathy that made me think I was finally somewhere I belonged. \nWith Gift of Tulips, I wanted to create a game that really exemplified that experience in the form of a game. The player that wins will most likely be the one that gives out the most tulips and gives them to a variety of players. If a player simply hoards what they have, they may not get far. \nThe artwork of Gift of Tulips is reminiscent of the flower fields of Keukenhof, the blue and white delftware pattern that is unique to the Netherlands, the windmills and waterways of the countryside, and the buildings of Amsterdam.\nESTIMATED TIMELINE\nBelow is what we think the timeline for Gift of Tulips will be. It's an estimate and we have a buffer, as things can always happen that we don't anticipate. We always hope to deliver early, but we do know the reality of life means that surprises can happen.  \nTHANK YOU SO MUCH!\nWe'd also like to thank the following people for all of their help:\nZach from Board with Friends for making the How to Play video. \nEric from What's Eric Playing, Aaron from Game Enthus, 90 Second Nerd, Open Seat Gaming, Edo from Gaming with Edo, Travis from Purple Phoenix Games, BJ from Board Game Gumbo, Kurt and Traci from MFGCast, Krista from the Board Game Cantina,  Jacqueline from Pudgy Cat Games, and David from Meeple Mountain for reviewing/previewing Gift of Tulips.\nJack from Cardboard Herald, BJ from Board Game Gumbo, Traci and Kurt from MFGCast,  and Zach from Board with Friends for helping raise awareness of Gift of Tulips", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf you've gotten this far, you are seriously considering supporting us and we really appreciate that.

Your favorite songs blasting through the speakers. Candy bar wrappers piled next to a warm drink in the cheap plastic cupholder. Your companion riding in the passenger seat, snapping pictures of landmarks as you settle into the hypnotic rhythm of the road. But be careful: this fun road trip could get dangerous as you drive through Death Valley.\n\nDeath Valley is a pocket-sized, push-your-luck, tableau building game for 1-2 players, with each traveler striving to assemble the best mix of cards in their Journey and Scrapbook in order to win the game.\nDeath Valley is 18 cards, packaged in a portable and durable wallet.\n\nEach turn, players will choose whether to assign a card to their Journey, or move cards from their Journey to their Scrapbook. Cards feature stars (points), special abilities (affect the value and position of cards), and some interesting facts about Death Valley.\n\nEach card also has a hazard (Heat, Terrain, Flood or Animals) listed. Having 3 of the same Hazard visible in their tableau will cause the player to bust and lose all the progress in their Journey.\nAll 4 hazards and their card distribution within the game.\nAt the end of the game the player with the most stars in their Journey, plus any additional points from card abilities, is the winner.\nTo set up the game, shuffle all 18 cards and place 1 face-up between the players. On a player\u2019s turn they have 3 choices: add the face-up or face-down card from the top of the deck to their own Journey, or Rest. When a player Rests, they move at least one card from their Journey to their Scrapbook (stacking them into a single pile if they select multiple cards) and shuffle as many of their remaining Journey cards into the deck as they choose.\nAfter the player takes their action for the turn, they check for Hazards among the visible cards in their Journey and Scrapbook. If they have 3 of the same Hazard type showing (3 Flood cards, for example) the player busts: 1 of the Hazard cards is removed from the game and the rest of the player\u2019s Journey cards get shuffled back into the deck.\nOnce there is only one card remaining in the center area, the game ends. Each player counts up the stars showing in their Journey row. Visible cards in the Journey and Scrapbook might have abilities that adjust that score. Once all effects have been applied, the player with the highest star count is the winner.\nBackseat Driver Variant\nIf you want to really press your luck and give up a little control, try out the Backseat Driver Variant. In this variant players may choose to play the face-up card on their opponent\u2019s journey as well as their own. At the end of each turn you will check to see if either player busts.\nSolo Mode - Designed by Kevin Ellenburg and Mike Mullins\nThe game will come with rules for solo play. Here you will face an AI explorer that thinks through its action each turn similarly to a player (playing the more intense Backseat Driver Variant). This explorer never rests in its pursuit of adventure.\nIf you would like to try the game yourself, the mostly black and white preview PNP is available at PNP Arcade now!\nhttps://www.pnparcade.com/products/death-valley-kickstarter-preview\nIn previous campaigns we created expansion material and used it as stretch goals. Since 2018, we've just given it away from the start. So no worries on whether we'll hit it or not, you are getting bonus content if you pledge here. The free expansion for this campaign is Death Valley: Panamint City.\nThis expansion consists of 6 more cards, letting you customize the deck before playing Death Valley. Before play, organize all the base game and expansion cards by hazard type. Then select 3 Animal, 4 Flood, 5 Terrain, and 6 Heat cards to shuffle into the deck. Unselected cards will not be used. Includes Vultures, Panamint City, Red Cathedral, Ubehebe Crater, Zabriskie Point, and Panamint Dunes.\nHere are the rewards available during this campaign.\n\nTo add more games to your order, you can do one of a few things:\nUS Backers only - to order games that ship now - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"0321us\" to get 15% off  of your order. Your website order will ship now, as long as you don't  order any pre-order items, otherwise the entire order will ship as  soon as everything comes in. As always, if you reach $25.00, you will  also receive free shipping. (NOTE: We previously offered a US Backer  code to combine games to save on shipping, but in most cases this was a  much better deal of free shipping AND 15% off.)\nInternational Backers only - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"0321international\" (REPEAT: THIS IS FOR BACKERS ONLY) to get free shipping on your extra game(s). Note: The limit on this  offer is 3 wallet games (and up to 3 expansions) total, including  anything that you order at Kickstarter. Anything above 3 wallet games  (and 3  expansions)  will end up bumping into the next shipping tier,  which can be as much as  $10 on international orders. These games will  all ship together with your Kickstarter rewards.\nThere are many notable games and we'll be featuring those throughout the campaign.\nWhile the game includes lots of great little historical facts about Death Valley, here's a little history about the game itself.\nDeath Valley was originally Kevin Ellenburg's entry to the 18 Card Challenge: Design A Game About A Real Life Location, and we\u2019re happy to see it coming to life. It has a unique take on the familiar push-your-luck mechanic where players have to think about managing their hazards as well as the card abilities, making each choice matter beyond the immediate threat of busting. On top of that, the gorgeous art from Fachri Maulana perfectly captures the lonely beauty of Death Valley National Park.\nFirst up is Kevin's initial pitch video in it's entirety (note some changes were made to the gameplay and cards throughout development):\nAnd here is the 18 Card Challenge video where it was a finalist, along with two other games that we eventually published, Skulls of Sedlec and Horreos. All 3 of which are available here. \n\n\nWe have an awesome following of repeat customers. As a result, we've built the Board Game of the Month Club.\nIt's a subscription service where you receive unreleased microgames,   promo cards, expansion content, and Kickstarter discounts ... every   month! Supporters also receive from $1 to $10 off EVERY WALLET GAME  that  we make. (Members back our Kickstarter projects at the $1 pledge  level  above.)\nOur 2021 $5+ packages include an episode of The Final Lightyear.\nGather your crew and gear and launch into a  fringe section of space where the law teeters over the edge and a good  captain can earn a living. There's no shortage of threats that endanger  the goodfolk of deep space, but luckily your torpedo bay is full and  lasers are hot.\nIn Lightyear you'll play solo or cooperative with a friend, as the  captain of a so-called starship, in hopes of earning some rewards and a  decent rep. Using tactical maneuvering and dice-based action selection,  you'll work through the sector's small, medium and large enemies trying  to gain rewards and ultimately live to see another day. Customizable  episodes will challenge you with variable enemies and threats while  offering powerful new gear and talented crew to help you in your  adventures.\nOur $10 packages include all of the above and something   extra. Generally it's a tiny game (up to 9 cards), or some expansion  / promo cards for our existing games.\nAnd our $20 package includes all of the above and a copy of   the featured wallet game (or the wallet game of your choice).   The featured wallet games also come with any expansion material that  is given away in the Kickstarter campaigns (like the Panamint City expansion  here).\nIf that sounds cool to you, check out the Board Game of the Month Club on Patreon!\nhttp://www.patreon.com/buttonshy\nThank you for checking out Death Valley!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith our method of publishing and using multiple manufacturers, there's always a chance that one part of the game could come in with an error, leading to delays.

Final version subject to updates.\n\nNew to Everdell?\nCheck out this great How to Play video from Watch it Played!\nWithin the charming valley of Everdell, beneath the boughs of towering trees, among meandering streams and mossy hollows, a civilization of forest critters is thriving and expanding... Everdell is a game of dynamic tableau building and worker placement played over four seasons. Whoever makes the most impressive city wins! \n\nOn your turn, you can take one of three actions:\na) Place a Meeple: You have a collection of wooden Critter meeples. You can place these on the board locations, events, and on Destination cards. Critter meeples allow you to perform various actions to develop your city: gathering resources, drawing cards, and taking other special actions.\nb) Play a Card: Each player is building and populating a city; a tableau of up to 15 Construction and Critter cards. There are five types of cards: Travelers, Production, Destination, Governance, and Prosperity. Cards generate resources (twigs, resin, pebbles, and berries), grant abilities, and ultimately score points. The interactions of the cards reveal numerous strategies and a near infinite variety of working cities.\nc) Prepare for the next Season: Critter meeples are returned to your supply and you gain bonuses depending on the season. The game is played from one year\u2019s winter through to the end of autumn. Players add up the points from their cards and other bonuses and whoever has the highest total wins!\nNew content that will delight and surprise you for many more seasons to come!\nGolden Occupied Tokens\nThe new Critter and Construction cards in Newleaf are played like normal Critter and Construction cards from the base game, except that you use Golden Occupied tokens instead of normal occupied tokens. These Golden Occupied tokens are limited -- a player can never use more than 3 in a game! These new cards are very powerful, so choose wisely which you'll spend your Golden Occupied tokens on! \n\nThrough Every Season Cards\nSince the beginning of Everdell\u2019s history, farming has been a vital part of the valley\u2019s way of life. Farmers face a number of challenges through the four distinct seasons of the year and must adapt as the weather changes. Experience the story of an Everdell farm throughout the year!\nThe 8 new special Farm cards in Mistwood replace the basic Farms in your Everdell game. These often give you the choice of two abilities, and you choose which of these abilities to use each time the card activates.\n\nMore Legends\nLegendary cards represent unique Critters and Constructions that are powerful upgrades of other Critters and Constructions. Use them when you are familiar with the base game, and are looking forward to a twist on a regular game! The More Legends cards in Mistwood are added into a game of Everdell in the same manner as the Legends from Everdell: Collector's Edition.\nNew ideas are arriving every day!\nStation Cards\nFaceup Critter and Construction cards on the Station board work like Meadow cards and may be played on your turn, but whenever you play a card from the Station, also gain the reward listed on the Train Car tile beside the card! This reward is gained after you have fully resolved the played card and any additional cards that may have activated as a result. After you've gained the reward, replenish both the Train Car tile and the card played.\nRemember: cards on the Station board are not Meadow cards, and therefore any abilities that affect Meadow cards (such as the Inn) do not apply to Station cards!\n\nVisitors\nNewleaf is a bustling and growing city in Everdell, and now that the railway system is in full operation, many new critters and big ideas are coming into the Emerald Valley. The Visitor cards that come into play on the Station Board offer players a new end game scoring opportunity!\nTo gain a Visitor card on your turn:\nPlace a worker on the Station. The Station is a shared location, allowing several workers at once, but you may only have 1 of your workers on this location at a time.\nChoose 1 of the faceup Visitor cards and discard it facedown on the Visitor discard pile.\nReveal 1 new Visitor card and choose 1 of the 2 faceup Visitor cards to take and place by your city. If you do not want either of the faceup Visitors, you may draw 1 from the top of the Visitor deck instead. If you selected one of the faceup Visitors, replace its card with another one from the Visitor deck.\nGain the reward shown on 1 of the Train Car tiles by the Station; set that tile aside and draw a replacement tile.\nVisitor cards will score their listed point values, if your city contains their requirements at the end of the game. Visitor cards that you have obtained and failed to please (by not meeting their requirements) are not worth any points at the end of the game.\n\nThe Knoll\nYou may place a worker on the Knoll to choose any 3 cards from the Meadow and/or the Station to discard. Replenish the discarded cards from the main deck, and draw any 3 cards into your hand from the Meadow and/or the Station. After drawing your cards, you may then gain the reward shown on 1 of the Train Car tiles. Set that Train Car tile aside and draw a replacement tile from the bag. Finally, replenish the 3 cards you drew into your hand.\nThe Knoll is a shared location, allowing several workers at once, but you may only have 1 of your workers on this location at a time.\nEverdell has a brand new villainess!\nNow while playing Everdell, you can pit your wits against Nightweave, our newest automated player for solitaire and two-player games. Nightweave is designed to function like a real player at your table: she has her own hand of cards, Prepares for Seasons on her own schedule, and, most importantly, she has her own agenda!\n\nNightweave has her own Big Critter meeple along with 8 spider meeples (not just 6!) that will move about the board to do her bidding -- blocking exclusive Locations, taking events away before you can get them, and even enacting Plots and Plans that will interfere with your options as a player, reminiscent of the Weather cards from Spirecrest.  She has eight different personalities that influence what she targets and focuses on, so there's lots of variety in gameplay!\n\nWhat Happens on Nightweave's Turn?\nTurn over the top card of Nightweave's Activity deck. These cards are the heart of her decision-making during the game, instructing her to play cards into her city, place spider meeples on previous, exclusive Locations, take a Basic or Special event, etc.\nNightweave will perform the first action listed for her current season, if possible. If she cannot perform this action for any reason, she will take the second action for her current season. If she cannot take that action either, she will perform as much of the Default action at the bottom of the card as she can. This could include discarding cards, collecting point tokens (yes, really!), and/or a number of other actions.\nIf Nightweave herself is in the Meadow and there are no spiderlings left in her lair when she draws an Activity card with a Spider or Nightweave icon, she will Prepare for Season. \nThe game ends when you run out of actions and when Nightwave Prepares for Season at the end of Autumn.\n\nCan you stop Nightweave from taking over Everdell? Check out the Rulebook for more in-depth information about this automated player! \nhttps://static1.squarespace.com/static/5eefaf5a2819042bf0d4099b/t/6047b72c79a2da41d1f2a50c/1615312716704/Prototype+Rulebook+%281%29.pdf\nAll items shown are available as add-ons in Kickstarter and will also be available to add to your pledge in the Pledge Manager after the campaign.

Based on previous campaigns, we anticipate that you should not have any additional fees associated with receiving your reward package (customs, clearance, etc.) if you\u2019re in one of these regions. If you\u2019re outside of one of these regions, you may need to pay customs fees, specific taxes, and/or other local fees. Please see the FAQ and check with your local authorities for more details. \nIf your reward is shipping to one of the destinations shown on this More Shipping Destinations chart, we are not collecting taxes or customs fees, but it may ship from a local hub. The Destinations Summary below details which countries are in which regions. \nIf you're outside of the countries included in this Destination Summary, please reference the Expanded Worldwide Shipping details below. \nWe originally did not offer shipping to destinations outside of those listed in our Destination Summary due to cost and reliability concerns. We are now able to offer shipping to all destinations outside of those listed above only if the backer accepts that we are unable to provide free reshipments for any packages lost in transit (We typically offer one reshipment at no additional shipping cost for areas listed on our Destination Summary.) \nWe plan to ship these packages worldwide from our fulfillment center in Germany (for best cost), so please take that into account when considering your import costs. Due to the reliability challenges for destinations not listed specifically in our destinations graphic above, if your package is lost in transit, we will only be able to provide you with a reshipment if you pay the shipping cost again.\n\nBy backing this campaign and asking us to ship your rewards to an address outside of the locations listed on our Destination Summary, you understand and agree that you are responsible for paying the cost for a reshipment in the event that your initial shipment is lost in transit. The reshipment cost for lost packages is the same cost as listed on the shipping table here. You also agree that you are responsible for paying any taxes, customs, and other local fees or charges associated with receiving your rewards. \nWe collect and remit taxes for each of these regions described below, as required by local law and our scope of business. Some regions do require that taxes are remitted based on both the product cost and shipping cost, so keep that in mind as you plan for these costs. Taxes will be collected in the pledge manager after the campaign along with shipping. Remember, we are a US company registered in these territories, so rates may be different than you\u2019re used to seeing for local companies! Please see below for more information about the tax rates to be collected for each destination. The pledge manager will calculate and collect the appropriate tax based on the many requirements in place at the time the pledge manager runs. For all destinations outside of these specifically listed below, you may be required to remit local taxes yourself.\nClick here to see local tax rates in the U.S.\nWe collect and remit sales tax in all US states where we\u2019re required to by our scope of business and local laws.

Three different crops\u2014in this case, pumpkins, corn, and beans\u2014are planted close together. Corn provides a lattice for beans to climb. The beans bring in nitrogen from the air into the soil, and the pumpkins provide a natural mulch ground cover helping to reduce weeds and keep pests away. \nAll the crops, fruits, flowers, and hives are represented by mini-tracks. The areas are interconnected to other elements in the game, giving you bonuses along the way. Many crops generate goods that are used to unlock bonus actions. Advancing on all of these tracks offers various amounts of points, advancements, and bonuses.\nThree Sisters is the brand new loaded roll-and-write game from the designers of Fleet: The Dice Game, Wasteland Express Delivery Service, Piepmatz, Stellar, and more. Three Sisters packs all the decisions and fun of a full gaming experience into an efficient and innovative package. \n The Tractor Meeple is an alternative meeple to Farmer Edith for those extra busy days in the yard!\nPreview Video from Tantrum House \nThree Sisters is played over 8 rounds. Each round, dice are rolled based on the number of players, grouped by number, and each group is placed on a section of the action rondel. Then players take turns drafting one die and using it. When everyone is done, everyone gets another action based on the die that is remaining.\nThe die you take lets you do two things: Work your farm based on the value of the die and then take the action of the section you took it from.  When you work on your farm, you are focused on the zone matching the die value. You may either Plant or Water. The actions on the rondel let you interact with other areas of your yard like your shed, fruit,  or apiary. \nThe player sheets have several areas: Your field, divided into six zones, each containing the three crop types, and various other areas related to additional actions you can take: Fruits, perennial flowers, your apiary, and a shed with tools that have special abilities.\nHow to Play Video from All You Can Board \n Three Sisters has a fully developed solo mode sure to satisfy solo gamers of all types.

This means that while the first round of the game will play normally, every subsequent round will have a weather effect that will provide emergent tactical decisions and opportunities for you as you farm.\nThe weather expansion board sites above the game board and the cloud meeple is used to mark the weather condition that is in play for the round.\n We appreciate SO MUCH that you have considered supporting Three Sisters on  Kickstarter. Shipping is expensive and difficult. Motor City Gameworks understands that you have many choices on how to spend your hard-earned gaming dollar. \nWe would like to help with some of the cost of shipping to make it as bearable as possible. Please see the shipping estimates below. \n All estimates include a significant discount! \nWhile the shipping could change, we have worked very hard to provide the best possible value by setting up partnerships all over the world.  This allows us to provide customs-friendly shipping to the USA, Canada, the EU, Australia, and parts of Asia. If you reside anywhere not listed, please contact us through Kickstarter and we can provide a shipping estimate.  Shipping will be charged post-campaign in the pledge manager. You will be able to confirm your reward, updated total with shipping, and your address.\n *Rest of Asia includes Japan, Korea, South, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, Hong Kong, Macao\n\nAdditional Copies\nAdditional copies will be available in the pledge manager after the campaign for $29/ea. Those extra copies will include all Kickstarter exclusive content.\n\nShipping Estimates for Additional Copies\nThe current shipping estimates are based on one copy, weighing near 1.5lbs. The shipping with additional copies will be calculated based on weight and the shipping discount will come off the top of the total.  The estimates below are for planning purposes,  it may come in less or more.\n\nIn most non-US regions, each additional copy would be $5 additional shipping, up to 3 three add-on copies (4 total copies on an order).\n\nFor US backers,  each additional copy would be $2 additional shipping, up to 9 add-on copies (10 total copies on an order).\n\nAgain, do not add these to your order on Kickstarter, back for one copy and additional copies can be added during the pledge manager.

Before the plane crashes, players must agree by majority vote to Hit the Silk!\nThe plane height is tracked by the Altimeter, which also indicates when you will cast a vote - is it time to Hit the Silk!?

From these, they must choose to keep 4 and openly discard the other 2. \nHere are the cards you might find:\nASSETS\nBriefcases - stashed with loot (at values of \u00a310k, \u00a320k, \u00a330k, \u00a340k)\nParachutes - to save your life\nKnives - to defend against theft\nSelection of Cards from the Game\nACTIONS (when played, these cause the plane to lose altitude)\nSpy - looks at another players' hand\nHandcuffs - attach yourself to another player to prevent them jumping without you\nKey - unlock handcuffs OR open the lockbox\nSteal - speculatively steal from another player \nKung Fu - defend an attempt to rob you\nRevolver - threaten a player with your gun to demand items\nBullet - combine with a revolver to take matters into your own hands and gain loot\nPoison - poison another player to accelerate negotiations\nAntidote - save a player from death by poison\nSUNDRY\nPilot's Licence - gives you an advantage if you're the last man standing and need to land the plane - see section below!\nFlannels - just a pile of laundry, unless you're swindling someone in a trade\nOn your turn card - reference card for game play\nON YOUR TURN\nThe starting player (selected at random) begins her turn by taking as many of the following actions as she wishes:\nPlay Reference Card\nChange Cards (once only per turn) - trade out unwanted items from your hand for new ones. Players will see what you discard. As the plane descends, you'll get more choice in the card draw. \nPerform actions - use as many action cards from your hand as you want. Remember each action causes the plane to drop lower!\nOffer trades - make deals with other players and exchange cards face down. No one said you had to be truthful in the trade right?\n...or do nothing. There's a cost to doing nothing though - the plane drops another 500ft before the next player begins their turn, with one eye on their hand and the other on the Altimeter. \nHIT THE SILK!\nWhen the opportunity arises to jump out of the plane (as indicated on the Altimeter), the players vote to wait or Hit the Silk! If there's no majority decision to Hit the Silk! then players return to the plane and continue negotiating and seeking out the items and loot they need. \nIf there's a majority vote to Hit the Silk! everyone jumps out of the plane. Then players reveal all of their cards and find out whether the team has sufficient cash to pay off the casino (and hopefully some surplus!).\nAnyone handcuffed to someone wearing a parachute gets dragged off the plane and the fates of the two are entwined. Two parachutes will save them, one will not.\nSTRATEGY\nBe careful what you reveal! In collaborating with others, you will need to convince them you have a parachute and sufficient cash. Here's the catch - in doing so, you make yourself vulnerable to theft or attack from the desperate. \nYou have a number of tactics at your disposal: trades (you can cross someone or trade honestly), bluff about your hand, defend your assets with a weapon, or go after a parachute by theft or force. Be warned - alliances can be fragile and you definitely can't rest on your laurels. Fortunes can change in the turn of a hand. \nWAYS TO WIN\nYou land safely as part of a group with enough cash to pay off the casino\nIf left on the plane without a parachute, you skilfully land the falling plane (see below)\nWAYS TO LOSE\nYou land safely, but without enough cash between you. Without the casino's money, you're as good as dead\nYou're killed (shot, poisoned or handcuffed to someone without enough parachutes between you)\nYou're left on the plane without a parachute and it crashed into a lake, mountain or runway\nLAND THE PLANE!\nWithout a 'chute, left high and dry, any stragglers get a last ditch attempt to land the plane. Flying isn't exactly your forte, so don't expect good odds. Maybe lady luck will be on your side though. \nThe Card Organiser is flipped to play the Finale Ending\nPlayers flip the board over and navigate the mini game with two dice that determine the direction and distance of plane movement. Luck interweaves strategy as your decisions and dice rolls guide the plane closer to the ground. It's a frantic attempt to dodge the lake, land and screech to a halt before the aircraft hits the mountainside. \nRULEBOOK\nAbove, we've tried to introduce the game in a story telling way, but if you're looking for a deeper understanding of the rules,  here's our draft gameplay guide.\nYou can also get an idea of how to play from this video put together by Lance of Love2Hate Board Games:\nNORTHERN DICE\n\"It\u2019s nail biting stuff, and it\u2019s that captivating theme and engagement that we loved.\" Read Northern Dice's excellent preview: A 5000ft Leap Of Faith\n\nBOARD GAME REVIEW\n\"There is a lot of mayhem, amusement and take that packed into the deck of cards.

Don\u2019t miss out!\" \nWatch below: Jim.Gamer of What Board Game conducted an interview with Brendan Mills, designer of Hit the Silk!\nOur prototype went out to a number of other previewers and we've collected some of the great feedback for the game here: \nHere are the pledges offered in our Kickstarter. \nIf you are a retailer and interested in further details, please visit the FAQ section or email orders@escapeplanboardgames.com\nAs if the base game wasn't thrilling enough, we're hoping to unlock some additional, exciting stretch goals during the campaign.\nThere's a mix of component upgrades and brilliant, new game features.

At the end of the campaign, we'll wait a few weeks for pledges to be sent through to us by Kickstarter and begin using that time to finalise the artwork - and make any adjust if we reach stretch goals that require us to modify anything. \nIn the mean time, we will open up a system to allow backers to pay for shipping and manage their pledge. We'll then provide a cut off date for getting that detail to us and lokck in the final numbers of production and finalise the specifications. \nFrom there, we'll send the files over to LudoFact and they will pass through data control. We know from experience of working with them that they are reliable and communicative. We anticipate that production will finish in the Autumn and we will then move into fulfilment in the early Winter. \nAny questions, do drop us a note! \nShipping Costs will be collected after the campaign ends. We anticipate the following prices and will do our very best to keep to these estimates. \nPlease note these shipping costs reflect the postage for a single unit of Hit the Silk!\nIf you need a quote for multiple items, please send us a direct message and we will do our best to assist you with a more accurate idea of price. \nShipping Estimates\nGermany \u00a35\nUK, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg \u00a36\nSwitzerland, Czech Republic, Denmark, Liechtenstein, Austria, Italy, Vatican City \u00a37\nFrance, Monaco \u00a39\nHungary, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia \u00a310\nSpain, Ireland, Portugal, Sweden \u00a312\nRest of Europe \u00a315-20\nUSA/Canada \u00a315\nRest of the World \u00a320-25\nCustoms-friendly shipping will be offered to UK, EU, US & Canadian backers.\nHit the Silk! brings a lot of fun to the table.

In early 2020, it was re-imagined during lockdown as a semi-cooperative, social game.  We hope you will help us bring it to life. \n\nThanks for reading about our project! Do message or email us if you have any questions. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSECOND KICKSTARTER PROJECT\n\nWe're still fairly new to the board game category, but we do have the experience of running a successful campaign the first time around, delivering 75% of orders ahead of schedule. We also many years experience in delivering successful games in a parallel industry: escape rooms. There's a lot of transferred knowledge we bring with us. Whilst we are reaching a new audience for board games, we do have an established following of gamers and marketing experience in the team to extend our reach.\n\nPRODUCTION VALUE\n\nOur default is to always aspire to the highest quality available; the challenge is that this needs balancing with affordability. We're asking for backing for a new project and are aiming for a price point that is attractive to supporters without compromising on component quality. We're working with industry experts to find this balance.\n\nMANUFACTURING & SHIPPING DURING COVID-19\n\nAs with any large volume order, there is an inherent risk of delay to project delivery. Experience shows us to manage this risk best, we need to work with reputable suppliers who have a track record of delivery high quality projects to an agreed timescale. The COVID-19 pandemic presents many unknowns and may delay the production a little, but happily, we are sourcing from European suppliers so we are unlikely to see significant delays. We have had their assurances that the impact is minimal at this time.\n\nWe have developed the product as far as possible (manufactured prototypes; fully tested game play; artwork design signed off; marketing plan devised) prior to manufacture. Therefore, we do not foresee any delays from our end. We're excited by the prospect of Kickstarter support bringing this game to market.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nReusability and recyclability\nWe are working with eco-conscious European suppliers that have a green promise. It is intended that we will make the product fully from recyclable materials to avoid any landfill increase.\nSustainable materials\nCardboard: the paper industry is very energy-intensive, however most of the required energy can be produced in-house via renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. We will seek out the cardboard with the highest possible percentage of recycled material saving resources and consuming the least energy. Where wooden pieces are used (minimal), sustainable forestry will supply. We aspire to avoid plastic.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nWe insist on working with a factory that has an eco-conscious policy that invest in renewable energy and use local/regional sources to avoid unnecessary long distance haulage.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Strapped in!", "descp": "Access to all project updates and a chance to buy anything advertised in the campaign (although at a higher price after the campaign closes) or pick up any other products you may have missed from previous campaigns.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2021"}], "stat": ["35 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a322 or more", "title": "Hit the Silk!", "descp": "Hit the Silk! board game, available at \u00a322 (discounted from the retail price)\nPledge for the game now and shipping costs are collected after the campaign ends.

Beyond that, we'll be commissioning other freelancers to work with us. Beyond that... who knows? How exciting is that? \n\nRewards \nWe're keeping it simple. The rewards are where you can buy issues of the magazine. This Kickstarter will establish a product/market fit for the mag before we go to print and make more issues. We're inviting retailers and advertisers to be part of this from day one via this Kickstarter. \nThe Kickstarter platform doesn't let you choose more than one reward, so please email editor@freelancermagazine.co.uk if you are interested in more than one reward and I can sort it out for you. \n\nThe Team \nSophie Cross (it's me!) is the founder and editor of Freelancer Magazine.

And to filmmaker, Jesse Roth, for shooting and producing the Kickstarter video.

As the leader of a noble house seeking the favour of the Emperor you plan to aid in its reconstruction. Collect the materials you need to contribute to rebuilding the Palace monuments, and commemorate the restoration by creating a beautiful painting of his beloved gardens.\nWill your efforts catch the eye of the Emperor, or will your rival nobles be honoured instead? Only one house will win the Emperor\u2019s ultimate recognition.\nEternal Palace is a highly interactive dice-placement Euro game for 1-5 players. Players assign workers, represented by dice, to locations based on their combined value. You'll visit locations to gain resources, rebuild monuments, and gather painting pieces for your masterpiece. \nDice placement\nThe way dice are played in Eternal Palace is unlike any other game. You'll roll dice and secretly group them behind a screen. Your opponents will know what dice you have but not how you'll use them. Will you use the 3/4/5 to visit locations 3, 4, and 5 or will you group them to visit location 12? Or maybe something in between? Predicting your opponents moves and making a surprise move yourself really elevates Eternal Palace to a game that is truly great! Once the dice are locked in, you can either stick to your decision or use some wisdom to manipulate your dice and go somewhere completely different!\nInteractive and positive gameplay\nUnlike other worker/dice placement games that focus on blocking opponents, the interaction in Eternal Palace is focused around mini races at each location. Get to the top of a location's track first and you'll get a bonus point. The race at each location means you'll always be interested in what your opponents are doing. Should you try to catch up or will you focus your efforts elsewhere?\nGreat table presence\nGaining points has never been so beautiful. Each painting layer you gather in Eternal Palace is layered onto your canvas to create a unique painting, which scores you points at the end of the game. If you win one of the race tracks, you'll gain a unique feature piece and a bonus point.\nHand- cut prototype of the painting pieces in action - the cut will be much more accurate in the production version!\nGather painting pieces throughout the game to paint your masterpiece\n\n*All photographs on this Kickstarter page are photos of the prototype, not a pre-production copy of the games, so dimensions, components and colours are subject to minor changes.\n\n- Rahdo\nThe rulebook will be translated into these languages and will be available as a free download from Board Game Geek by the time the game is fulfilled\n\n\nWe're currently working on a storage solution option for the painting pieces and we're hoping to update everyone on the progress of this by the end of the campaign. \nThe Deluxe Edition is limited edition which is unlikely to ever come into retail stores or mass distribution. If it does, it will be at least 3 months after the base game.\nThe miniatures from the deluxe edition come in grey, but they look great when painted!\nKickstarter pack - Fully unlocked\n\n\n\nFor this Kickstarter campaign we have chosen to focus our stretch goals on making the Kickstarter pack even better to reward our Kickstarter backers even more! They will be revealed below once the campaign is funded.\n\nAll stretch goals now unlocked\n\n\nWant to make Eternal Palace even better? In addition to stretch goals that are focusing on the Kickstarter pack, these social goals will improve the game quality for all versions of Eternal Palace.\nFollow the instructions below to unlock some great component quality upgrades \n\nThe image now has over 75 Thumbs so the box will now be upgraded with a spot UV! Click this image to go to the image on Board Game Geek and boost it even more if you haven't already!\nThis Instagram post now has over 300 likes so we've upgraded the rulebook with a linen finish. Click this image to go to the Instagram post.\nThis Facebook post has now been shared over 100 times so all cardboard tokens have been upgraded to 2mm thickness.\nWe now have over 150 retweets, so we've unlocked linen finish on all cards!\nWe now have 300 more Kickstarter followers so all card stock has been upgraded to 330 gsm\nThe deluxe edition will be exclusive to Kickstarter backers and direct orders for at least a 3 month period. It may never enter distribution!\n- Slickerdrips\nGather resources,  recruit advisors, rebuild monuments, and create your masterpiece to gain the favour of the Emperor.\nRoll your dice to see what values you have to play with this round. The player with the lowest total goes first. You'll be able to see each others dice rolls but you'll secretly group them behind a screen, so you won't always be able to predict what other players will do this round\nGroup your dice to visit higher value locations  or keep them separate to visit multiple locations. You'll even be able to manipulate your dice and change your strategy based on the other players' actions.\nVisit locations to gather resources. Visit with more workers to gain bonus resources. Resource gathering spots (and some other spots in the game) are also a race to the top: be the first up the track to gain a unique feature piece for your painting and an extra point for the end of the game\nPlacing a die here, the blue player gains 1 wood. The yellow player placed 2 dice here so gains 3 wood\nAdvisors give ongoing benefits or powerful one-time bonuses. You'll be able to recruit them at spots 1 & 2 in slightly different ways. At spot 1, draw 3 face down cards and choose from them, at spot 2, choose from the face up cards before your opponents hire them.\nPlacing a die here, the blue player recruits an Advisor\nContributing to rebuilding will gain you favour with the Emperor, and an art piece towards your masterpiece. You'll also claim the monument to take credit for your contribution but timing is important and these monuments will change hands throughout the game so only one person can ultimately take the credit. \nPlacing a die here, the blue player pays 1 wood and gains 1 favour. They also gain the painting piece and monument\nCreating your masterpiece is key to being honoured by the Emperor. The locations you visit will gain you a painting piece, which scores points and brings the game closer to an end. You might even get a unique feature piece to add to your painting if you're the first to 'complete' a location. \nFinishing your painting first and getting the longest 'run' of painting pieces will gain bonus points at the end of the game.\n2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12 - a run of 7 painting pieces!\n- Rahdo\nThe solo mode is included in all versions of Eternal Palace\nIn the Solo Mode, you'll play against the Master, an AI opponent. The Solo mode plays similarly to a 2 player game but after you've grouped your dice the Master's dice groups are determined by the flip of a card. \nWhen it's the master's turn he will decide where to go, first checking if any of his dice values are the same as yours (in which case he'll try to beat you there) then checking which dice spots gain him a benefit (like going up a track or taking a monument)\nThe master is a worthy opponent, with 3 difficulty levels to suit all player skill levels. \nThe solo mode also has different sets of cards that can be used, which gives the master a different feel every time. This makes the solo mode very variable and offers a lot of replayability!\nThe solo mode is compatible with all expansions, except the turn order expansion\nThe solo mode is included in all versions of Eternal Palace.\nFull solo rules are in the print and play folder\n\nThe Turn order tokens (included in the base game) give advanced players a way to alter their turn order and perhaps gain an advantage at a pivotal moment in the game! They can be played after dice are grouped but before they are revealed.\nEach expansion adds a unique twist to Eternal Palace.\nLabyrinth\nRace through the labyrinth to gain bonuses. Will you take the longer path to gain additional favour from the Emperor or will you race to the centre?\nExports\nIn the Exports expansion complete export requests at the market by trading goods and you'll gain the benefit of the export. \nYou'll gain the bonus when he export is complete and you'll even be able to visit the fulfil the export request more than once to gain the benefit multiple times\nComposition\nIf you complete specific painting combinations first you'll gain a bonus. Some combination are harder to complete but you'll get better bonuses\n\nThe Labyrinth and Exports expansions are only included in the deluxe edition of Eternal Palace. The Composition expansion is included in the Kickstarter pack (free to all Kickstarter backers)\nThe Labyrinth, Exports, and Composition expansions are also compatible with the solo mode.\n- We're Not Wizards\n Help us make games - We're a small company and we rely on Kickstarter income to survive.

Prices listed below are indicative and may change slightly in the pledge manager.\nYou can pledge at the \u00a31 level now to gain access to the pledge manager.\nWe always offer excellent rates for retailers around the world. If you are a retailer, please send us a message with your store's email address and/or physical address and we will send you our rates!\nFor groups of 6 or more people, we are happy to provide group pledge discounts, as long as the games are sent to a single location. Prices will vary between location (due to shipping and customs) so please message us for rates.\nUnfortunately, we won't be able to offer group pledges for some countries in Asia, so please message us beforehand so we can check.\nWe are subsidising shipping and absorbing some of the cost of each shipment. Costs are shown in the approximate local currency. To double-check the pricing to your region or for more accurate pricing, please go to to the pledge tier and select your country.\nEU2: Italy, Sweden, Greece, Cyprus, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Slovakia, Turkey, Romania.\nAll other EU countries are EU1\n\nActual shipping charges will be charged in the pledge manager and may be cheaper than the amount stated.\nDue to previous shipping issues, we do not ship to South America, Mexico, Russia, India and all of the Middle East (in particular UAE, or Saudi Arabia).\nAn optimistic prediction of the timeline:\n April: KS completes. We finish all remaining graphic design and development.\n June: Submit Files to manufacturer\n  July & August: Manufacturing\n September: Shipping from China to the UK begins\n October: Arrives in ports\n  November: Fulfilment commences\n  December Fulfilment completed. \n January: Most backers have their copies.\n  PLEASE NOTE: If there are any delays it could push this back farther for completing fulfilment. The above is an optimistic prediction. We always add extra time to our tiers' estimated delivery dates - as delays can happen. Therefore a realistic prediction is that people's games arrive in January/February - as we have indicated in the tiers themselves.\nCONVENTION SALES: We will be taking some copies to sell at conventions. However, by backing the KS, you are: guaranteeing yourself a copy, getting cheap delivery, and helping us continue making games. We will guarantee IF your copy cannot arrive before these conventions, but you or a friend are attending the convention, you/they can pick it up from that convention. Conventions we may be attending before fulfilment include UK Games Expo, Origins & Gen Con.\n\nAt Alley Cat Games we're a multicultural team so we're acutely aware of the importance of appropriate research when representing a culture that doesn't reflect our own heritage, even when the setting is fictional like in Eternal Palace. That's why we paid a cultural advisor and involved them in our research on Eternal Palace at an early stage. We made a lot of changes to the game and took on advice for things such as representation, thematic choices and even colour options. \nIt's also important to point out the one aspect of the game that we didn't change, the easels. These were not commonly used in China during the time period, but we felt that they added a table presence and beauty to the game that would not have been as striking had we meticulously represented painting styles in an accurate way.

Visit CaperEurope.com to join the heist.\nStay Connected with Keymaster by Joining our mailing list.\nFollow us on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook.\nJoin the Caper: Europe Card Game Group on Facebook!\nIn Caper: Europe, turns follow a simple structure. On your turn, you will take pick a card from your hand and play it on your side of the board. Your opponent will do the same. Then swap hands. Follow this pattern until you only have one card left in hand, which you will discard. This happens over six rounds for two types of cards: Thieves and Gear.\nYou will also need to keep their eyes on the loot. Each location rewards points for the Mastermind (that's you!) who controls it at game end. Controlling locations require Capers. Each time you gain a Caper, move the location's Thiefle one space toward yourself on the Caper track. If the Thiefle is closer to you than your opponent at the end of the game, you win the location and gain it's benefits. \nAn experienced Mastermind (that'll be you one day) knows it takes a team to win. Each of the target locations has room for three Thieves and each thief has space for three pieces of Gear. Thieves and Gear work together to provide you points and give you control of locations. And despite common misconception, the Thieves of your crew are not selfish! Every gear card at a location counts toward all Thief abilities at that location. Strive to assemble crews whose abilities complement one another and assigns gear that provides bonuses to multiple thieves.\nCaper: Europe include everything you need to plan heists across four major European cities. Each city sets the stage for a unique heist experience each time you sit down at the table.\nWhat better way to celebrate our journey through the cities of Europe than with some postcards commemorating our favorite stops? For this campaign, you can participate in a series of challenges to unlock sets of vacation postcards from the Caper Universe. Each set you unlock will be added to your pledge for free! Reconnect with old game night rivals you\u2019ve been missing. Maybe pick out a couple favorites and use them as mini-prints in your hideout. And when it\u2019s safe to do so, challenge friends to a game of Caper: Europe.\nYou may be the type of Mastermind that wants to know every detail of the heist before it takes place. Which probably means you want to read the rules or take Caper for a spin on a virtual table. Our working draft of the Rules is available for you to peruse at the link below. Plus, check out the working draft of Old Bill while you're here!\nIf you own Tabletop Simulator (or want to purchase it) you can give Caper: Europe a try today!

Mattox in particular was enamored with bringing it to the US and so we obtained the US and Canadian rights with the understanding that Keymaster would rebrand the game and work with Josh Emrich to build out the world of the game through new illustrations. We released Caper in the fall of 2018, but by the time we needed to reprint the game in mid 2019, we didn't have capital to do so (we'd spent all our money printing PARKS).\nSo, we took the opportunity to dive into development with designer Unai Rubio (something we didn't have the opportunity to do when we originally localized the game). You can read about Unai's journey on BGG. We started by addressing community feedback around usability and learning the game, added some diversity to the cast of characters, then focused on redesigning the game around the best parts of the original.\nWe are so glad to be able to bring you this iteration of Unai's vision and are especially excited to have the worldwide rights to selling and distributing the game. Caper: Europe is truly a passion project and we hope the redesign feels that way to you.\nAll add-ons will be available in the pledge manager. You can purchase them after the campaign.\nThe full Keymaster Catalog (including our other decks of playing cards) can be purchased in the pledge manager to be shipped with you pledge.\nIf you are in the US or Canada and don't want to wait for the pledge, you can order all our games and merch available on our website - KeymasterGames.com.\nFlat Rate Shipping: You will only be charged the applicable rate above no matter how much you order. So, find (or make) some friends that want to split the cost of shipping with you! Once the campaign is completed, you will be given the opportunity to add additional copies to your order without increasing the cost of shipping.\nInternational VAT: We will be collecting VAT in the pledge manager and remitting it on your behalf. Your pledge will ship DDP (Delivery Duties Prepaid) to the US, Canada, EU, UK, Australia, and New Zealand. Those VAT rates are as follows: Canada 5%, Australia 10%, New Zealand 10%, United Kingdom 20%, EU 20% (we ship from France and pay at the French rate).\nUS Sales Tax: US residents, we will be collecting sales tax in the pledge manager for the following states: California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington\n\nAlternate Shipping Options: Paying for shipping is a drag. We get it! If the shipping prices above give you pause, there are several other paths to getting your hands on the Mastermind Edition.\n1) Join the Caper Facebook group or BGG Forums and organize a group pledge!\n2) Reach out to a FRIENDLY LOCAL game store in your area to ask if they are joining the retailer pre-order. (See retailer information below.)\nKeymaster is here to inspire you to explore life together. We think board games are a perfect avenue to create that joy and deep connection with each other, especially when they are beautiful and immersive experiences. Caper is particular is a chance to explore our quirky sides and share an engaging head to head game that should remind you of your favorite heist movie and quirky comedy all at once. We hope you love it!\nKeymaster Games is a very small company. Until last year, we only had 1 full time employee. And with the success of PARKS, almost all of our capital is devoted to trying to catch up with it's demand. Without your help, we wouldn't be able to bring Caper back to market this year. Additionally, Kickstarter is an incredible way to engage with you and share our passion for this game!

Until you confirm you pledge, we have no way of identifying which rewards you desire to receive or where you wish to receive them. If you do not confirm your rewards in the Pledge Manager within 6 weeks of the conclusion of the campaign, you agree that Keymaster will have fulfilled its obligations to you in full for payment received. We may, at our discretion, offer a refund or choose to ship your rewards if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 6 week window has elapsed.\nWe work with world class shipping partners, but they are only as good as the information they are provided. It is your responsibility to monitor the project's status and update your address as needed prior to fulfillment. The best way to monitor the project's status is to read our Kickstarter Updates. Should you provide an incorrect or out of date address, you will be responsible for costs incurred if a reshipment or reroute is need.\nThat said, even with world class partners and correct addresses, shipments are sometimes damaged or lost. If any part of your order, other than a game box, is damaged upon opening, we will provide free replacement parts for as long as we have them available.\nIf ever a shipment is not marked as delivered, we will cover the cost of reshipment. Additionally, we will cover the cost of 1 re-shipment for any lost or stolen package within 2 weeks of the package being marked as delivered and after our shipping partners conduct an investigation with the carrier.\nOur Goal is for you to be the first in the world to play our games. As such, we will not sell and deliver Caper: Europe at any convention or on our webstore until we have delivered games to a majority of our Backers.

You can go to our Discord channel to find scheduled events and ask questions!\nFor this campaign we will be releasing new Myth cards and other surprises on a regular basis and may also have funding goal stretch goals as well.\nCost:  Shipping is really expensive (almost as much as making the actual game) and we have tried to come up with pricing that accurately reflects our cost to get the game into your hands without creating a logistical nightmare on our side.  Your shipping will be added in the pledge manager.  We expect that we'll have to come out of pocket a bit based on what we are charging and we are ok with that.\nTracking: We will also be using non-trackable shipments in some cases in order to save on cost as tracking can add 30-50% or more in some cases. So please understand if we do not have tracking with your package we did so knowingly. Rest assured, that we will get you your game and any risk associated with a package not being trackable is on us.\nDelivery time: While we would love to get everyone their games at the same time, it is just not possible. There is a high likelihood that some areas of the world will get their games before others. Our commitment is to get the games ready and printed as fast as possible (we've already done a ton of the prep work).\nAt the factory we will break out the shipments to each fulfillment company with instructions to them that they should begin shipping as soon as possible upon receipt. In addition, because we have complete control over the U.S. shipments, you will not be able to order and receive the game on Amazon (or from any other US retailer) before our backers have it.\nPlease note: Because of unexpected delays and other unforseen issues, we reserve the right to sell the game at major conventions, even if they have not been delivered yet.  The reason for this is that conventions are among the best form of marketing and therefore necessary to give the game the best chance for success.\nOne guarantee we will give is that if we do release the KS exclusive version anywhere before the backers receive theirs it will be at a price that is higher (usually significantly) than what was offered in the campaign.\n\nRussian version will be made and fulfilled by Lavka Games", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a publisher that has brought more than 20 games to market thus far, we feel confident in our ability to get this done.

Around every corner goblins and ferocious minions seek to block the Heroes\u2019 path.  Where there isn\u2019t an enemy, traps are set, ready to spring on even the most prepared Hero.\nTiny Epic Dungeons features a modular dungeon that is unique with each play.\nThe game is played over 2 ACTS: the Dungeon and the Dungeon Boss. In both acts the players are constantly struggling against the waning firelight of their torch which decreases each turn. When the torch goes out, the Heroes are forever lost in the darkness.\nAfter clearing the dungeon of all its minions and finding the entrance to the lair, players must engage in an epic battle against the Boss. Each boss has unique abilities and a lair with a unique environment that gives various advantages and disadvantages depending on the skill used and where the Hero attacks from.\nThese Epic Monsters cannot be slain by mere swords, axes, arrows, and the occasional spell. Ritual Rooms around the dungeon must be used to lower their magical bond to the dungeon. The Dungeon boss must be lured to these rooms to lower their defenses and allow the Heroes to strike the final blow!\nVictory in Tiny Epic Dungeons is achieved by defeating the Dungeon Boss!\nIn order to do that, the Heroes will need to collect Legendary Loot, and Supreme Spells. \nHeroes of old crafted loot to honor the ways of their clans. Bear, Lion, Phoenix, and Panther. Heroes can discover pieces from these ancient sets that grow more powerful the more you collect. \nWill you be the greatest warrior the Bear clan has ever seen?

Except, they are not like normal goblins.  When you defeat a Mixy Goblin, something explodes! You'll draw a Potion Card to see what the effect is. Each Potion Card will describe a peril that occurs when you kill a Mixy Goblin and will also leave you with a handy potion for use later!\nAdditionally,  the mini expansion brings new Dungeon Bosses, Minions and Goblins to the game. Each presenting a unique challenge that will test even the best players! \n***Kickstarter-Limited Exclusivity - Deluxe content will not enter regular distribution.

It can be prone to many mistakes and delays, even for experienced publishers.\n\nWe are proud to say that we're prepared for the task at hand and have years of experience in successfully producing board games and fulfilling Kickstarter projects.\n\nHere are the steps we take to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 95% complete. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are working with an experienced manufacturing partner. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements and costs for when it comes time for shipping. We will provide tracking information for the boat when the games leave China.\n\n3. We are working with an experienced fulfillment partner. We are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way. They have fulfilled many projects and have proven to be communicative, punctual and respectful when dealing with our customers.\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication. I will be transparent with our process and involve our backers as much as possible. I will be present daily during the project to answer any questions and I read every comment. I will provide regular updates and supply photos of the progress.\n\nThank you for your trust in us!

City of Crowns and the Collector's Box will be coming to retail in various languages. There are no exclusive items in this Kickstarter campaign. If you'd prefer to wait for the items to become available in retail, we are 100% okay with that. Please just choose whichever option works best for you.\nIn Paladins of the West Kingdom: City of Crowns, noble allies have responded to the recent attacks against our borders. Only through careful negotiation and diplomacy will these dukes, barons, counts and margraves offer the aid we so desperately need. Will you be able to muster enough support to once again defend this great city, or will you crumble beneath the weight of indecision and apathy?\nKey Changes:\nBoard extensions for each player, providing a way to take the new Muster and Negotiate actions\nBoard extensions at either end of the Main Board, housing the new Muster and Negotiate cards, plus revealing more Townsfolk and Outsiders each round\nEach player has a new Diplomacy attribute to manage\nNew Townsfolk, Outsiders, Paladins, King's Orders and King's Favours\nUpdated rules for solo play, with an added difficulty level\nComponents\nThis deluxe Collector's Box is designed to fit Paladins, City of Crowns, and all additional content, such as promos and metal coins. And yes, it fits sleeved cards. See the photos below. All boards sit together over the wooden components and smaller cards, keeping everything in its place. The box is the same size as the Collector's Box for Raiders of the North Sea (295x295x69mm).\nThe Vassals Mini-Expansion\nIncluded inside every copy of the Collector's Box is a mini expansion, which adds new yellow workers to the game. These new Yellow Workers can be placed onto any Worker spot, regardless of its required colour. In addition to this, they also discount actions where they\u2019re placed by either 1 Silver or 1 Provision.\nFor those not interested in getting the Collector's Box, we should have a small amount of the Vassals Mini-Expansion available in our Promo Store later in the year. It is not available separately for this Kickstarter campaign.\n\n\nPreview from Meeple University\n Review from AllAboard Gamer\n2-Player Playthrough with designers, Sam and Shem\nSolo Playthrough with designer, Shem Phillips \n2-Player Playthrough from MvM\n 2-Player Playthroughs from The Brothers Murph\n2-Player online Playthrough from To Die For Games\n2-Player Playthrough from Meeple University\nTo add-on additional copies of of any product, first select the pledge level that best suits what you are wanting. All shipping fees will be added at this point. Then simply add the cost of any extra items to your pledge level. This will need to be done during the campaign, as there will not be a pledge manager. All pledges are in NZD. There are no additional shipping costs for add-on items.\nYou cannot have multiple languages as part of the same pledge.\nTwo weeks after the campaign ends, we will send out surveys where you will have the chance to confirm what add-ons you included in your pledge.\nEach copy of Architects will include the 2018 KS Promos (excluding the tax stand), provided in a separate bag.\nEach copy of Paladins will include the 2019 KS Promos inside the box (in a separate bag of French/Portuguese).\nEach copy of Tomesaga will include the 2020 KS Promos inside the box.\nGroups:  Over the past 7 years we have always looked to improve how we handle larger group pledges. We want to offer the best prices, while keeping everything running smoothly for fulfillment. Therefore, we have set a lower price for all add-on items, regardless of the total quantity. There are no extra shipping fees for add-ons. There will not be any further discounts beyond this.\n\nRetailers: We will not be taking orders for retailers in this campaign. We recommend going through normal distribution channels. If this is not possible for your store, feel free to contact us after the campaign has ended for a price list.\nAll shipping rates are automatically added as you select your Reward Level.\nGarphill Games will handle production and fulfillment of all English versions.\nPixie Games will handle production and fulfillment of all French versions. The French edition is only available in France, Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland.\nMosaico Jogos will handle production and fulfillment of all Portuguese versions. The Portuguese edition is only available in Brazil and Portugal. All Portuguese copies will be sent using a tax-friendly shipping option.\nOther Languages\nOther language versions will also be produced on a similar schedule, but are not available through this Kickstarter campaign. This includes German, Italian, Spanish, Polish, Hungarian, Czech, Dutch, Chinese, Thai, Japanese, and more. If you would prefer one of these languages, you will need to wait for the retail release in your country.\n\nNo Stretch Goals?\nFor this Kickstarter we have decided not to offer any stretch goals. Instead, all components will be upgraded from day one!

At the webcam on the edge of my screen? Or at the people/notes on the screen, which makes me look like I'm looking down to anyone in the meeting? But most importantly, when you look AWAY from the people in your meeting, you can't see the other 90% of human communication which comes from  the NON-verbal!\n\n Center Cam changes the angle of your webcam, from the periphery of the screen, to the middle of the screen where the action is. Center Cam allows you to look at the people you're talking to and have them FEEL like you're looking at them- BECAUSE YOU ARE! \n   Now you can read the notes on your screen without looking like you're reading the notes on your screen! Teleprompter presentation? No problem! Live-streaming, sales, tele-therapy, tele-health, tele-whatever... Center Cam is the tool. \n\n The purpose of this tool is to facilitate better connections- and connection is what life is all about. Center Cam- A Better Connection. \n   We've conducted R&D with a partner manufacturer, and have operational models already. The unit is already in use with all of our product testers. We have the full package of camera, clip, light ring ready to rock. \n Update 1/28/21- We have completed 3D modeling for a custom hook that is attached to the clip as shown below. This will be 3D printed within the week!

We modified existing tech that already works, which eliminates HUGE costs/time from the process. Because of its new application and design, it is currently patent pending. We've also partnered with a European distribution company, which will save our EU backers time and money when they get involved in this campaign. It also increases our market to almost 1Billion people. \nWhat you'll get with every standard Center Cam order.\n   Various people have asked us what \"the plan\" is. And the plan is extremely simple- Help as many people improve their video-conference experience with Center Cam as fast as we can scale. Ian has run multiple businesses before, and we have scaling and transition plans in place. \n   We're excited to partner with Kickstarter and our backers to get this product launched and to change video-conferencing as we know it. Our backers are going to get rewarded with an a discount of 24% off of our projected retail price. THANK YOU!!!! We have great public rewards- however, we have some secret rewards built in if we hit some major milestones: $15k, $25K, $50k, $100k, etc. Show love and we'll return it.  \n\n\n We want our backers to know we're building a business, not just a gadget.

IN 24 HOURS!\nSTRETCH GOALS ARE NOW LISTED BELOW!)\n\nOur second ever Kickstarter, to make a new, wonderful album for 2021!!\nHello dear friends, fans and family,\n\nTwo years ago we asked for your help to support us making a new album, \"Jonny & The Baptists Love You & Hate Bastards\". And you were brilliant. We raised \u00a35380; made an album we're immensely proud of, and we able to pay everyone who worked on it a fair wage. We were able to pay for the producer, the engineers, all the equipment we needed to hire and the production work; and then the costs of pressing the CDs and their cases to a very high-quality. Thank you for this: you guys rock.\n\nWell, we're ready to make another album and we're asking for your help again. As you may know, we have always avoided getting a recording deal that would almost certainly demand a higher-percentage of our frugal earnings and, worse, limit our freedom to write and perform whatever we want. And, in this climate of no gigs and almost no income for us two, there's no way we could afford to pay costs and fees upfront and wait to recoup from sales in the autumn. \n\nSo - if you can help in any way, we'd be honoured. If you think you'd like to buy our album anyway, then please do so upfront and in so doing you'll also be a part of making it happen. And if you're feeling OK for money why not get a souvenir too - a lyric sheet and photo from the album recording, all signed and framed. A personal hand-written thank you card to accompany your new CD? Or maybe have your name in the album liner notes forever - or even get your very own zoom preview in April or May (where we'll do the new show for you, and any three songs from our back catalogue as the encore).\n\nIf you can't afford to help we still love you very much, and we understand how hard it is right now (hence why we're doing this again!). \n\nWith all our love,\nJonny & Paddy \n(Jonny & the Baptists)\nx x x x x x x x x x x x \n\n UPDATE: Woah, Nelly! (I think a. still a phrase and b. I also think it means what I think it means)\nSTRETCH GOALS.\nAs of right now, we are on \u00a39814 which is truly wonderful. Thank you all so much, from the bottom of our hearts. It's overwhelmingly kind and we're smiley and will keep doing our best to make this all super rewarding and joyful for everyone involved (especially all of you lovely lot).\nWe've had a bit of time to run the numbers and work out some more official budgets for proper stretch goals, make a few more reward tiers and fine tune how all this is going to work in a beautiful way. Here we go!\n STRETCH GOAL ONE - \u00a35000 - HIT!\nInstruments, Equipment & Fees\nThis stretch goal has already been met, and has given us the ability to repair our instruments and get the gear together to record the album to higher standard (not to mention it'll help us be brilliantly equipped to also tour the show with these instruments). It also covers the Kickstarter commission fee which we MAY OR MAY NOT WHO IS TO SAY initially not taken into account. THIS IS NOW SORTED HOORAY AND THANK CHRIST!\n STRETCH GOAL TWO - \u00a36500 - NO PROBLEM MATE!\nPay Paddy (blonde one, tall, wonky charm)\nThis stretch goals ain't far off, and (this is going to initially sound really silly but bear with us) gives us the ability to PAY PADDY. In the costing of the album we decided not to include paying ourselves as we know money is tight for everyone and we just wanted to make something uplifting without putting too much pressure on whether or not our time and work was budgeted for. This still makes total sense to us, however getting paid would make a huge difference to our lives and help with things like rent, bills, food, and self-esteem. The next stretch goal after this is Pay Jonny, but we're obviously going to split whatever we get to down the middle as we do that with everything. It felt odd writing this slightly personal money bit but hey we would rather be honest with you.\nSTRETCH GOAL THREE - \u00a38000 - DONEZO!\nPay Jonny (big beard, stout, youthful curmudgeon)\nMuch like the last goal, this goal allows us to PAY JONNY. I said it before but just to say it again, we will split this between us but anything towards our day-to-day costs of trying to make a record whilst the world (and the rather large prices therein) continues to spin around us would make a huge difference to our fears, concerns and money deadlines during the actual making of the album. We might even get to tick the box marked 'actually paid work' this year - who knows!\n STRETCH GOAL FOUR - \u00a39000 - SORTED MATE.\nProfessional Mastering & an Extra Track on the Album\nThis one's obviously a bit of a pipe dream, but usually the two of us and Rob have stabbed our way through mastering with no real idea of what we're doing, and each time we always get to six months after release and say \"Hey wouldn't it have been cool if this was professionally mastered? Oh well\" and in a magical idealistic world this could actually be possible this time. It would sound killer, and make us feel like real big time music boys. As a big thank you we'd even use the remaining money to book in extra studio time to record an extra track for the album. Wouldn't that be rad?\nSTRETCH GOAL FIVE - \u00a310000 - WE CAN ACTUALLY DO IT.\nProfessional Music Video for the Lead Single & an Extra Track on the Album\nNow this would clearly be a wild amount of money to be donated, but we think it's possible so here goes. If we hit 'the big 10 Kay-bos' (correct?) then we could make an actual professional music video that has things like a budget, a director and a camera person who isn't a phone balanced precariously on a brimmed hat. We'd love to do something like this to release online and promote the album and the tour, and if you help us make it a reality we promise we'll put our all into making it excellent. We'll even try once again to throw ANOTHER extra track on the record as a double thank you.\nTHERE'S ALWAYS ROOM FOR MORE!\nI'm going to stop writing now as these are numbers I feel uncomfortable imagining being able to wield in my actual hands in the name of creating something, but we have big plans and big ideas and if there's ever a world in which I need to write new stretch goals then I'm ready for it.

Cora, my eight-year-old daughter, and I both agreed that we were fed up of doing the same old maths worksheets. We decided we wanted to do something more exciting with our time instead - like design our own board game!  \nCora and I spent many enjoyable days working side by side on our game. Cora was having so much fun she never noticed me sneaking school work like maths, creative writing, art and computing into the project (shhh, don't tell her). As CoraQuest developed we both felt so pleased with it that we wanted to share it with other people too.\nWhile it started as a homemade project, CoraQuest has had massive amounts of support from a whole legion of playtesters. Although its roots are still true to the game Cora and I made together on our kitchen table, our playtesters have helped us develop CoraQuest from its rough and ready origins to a smooth-running, polished, and above all very fun game.\nThere's enough content in the CoraQuest box to keep you going for a very very long time. However, Cora and I had so much fun with the creative process of making the game that we wanted to provide the same exciting experience to others too. \n\n\nThe rulebook for CoraQuest includes guidance and encouragement on how to create and draw your own heroes, characters and adventures - making the game fully customisable.  \nWhat's more, we've even made a fantastic free web-based app that you can use to create your own heroes and print them out on \"official\" cards and matching standees. Just draw and upload your picture, choose your hero's stats and special abilities, and then print them out - it's as easy as that!\nCoraQuest is designed to be as accessible to children as possible without diluting any of the fun for adults. Here are three of the key features of the game:\nYou explore the dungeon by drawing cards from the dungeon deck and placing each card out into the layout.  This means every game you play will have its own unique dungeon map - providing a different experience each time. \nWhenever you venture into the dungeon there is a chance you will encounter some of the fearsome creatures that lurk there. Orcs, goblins and gremlins emerge from the shadows whenever a card with their symbol is added to the dungeon.  \nWhimsical and family-friendly narrative emerges during the game via the \"quest cards\" that are spaced out within the dungeon deck.  When a quest card is placed in the dungeon you read a short passage from the quest book and carry out any special instructions it gives you.   \nThe quest cards' illustrations include multiple elements that are open to interpretation, allowing you to use them as inspiration to design your own adventures.\nCombat is exciting, fun, and simple for even young children to understand. It's resolved using custom red and white dice. Your hero card and your weapon tell you what colour dice you need to roll, then you inflict one damage to your target for each success you get.  \nIf you're in combat and you completely miss your target your hero flips over to their \"determined\" side. This means you will get even more dice to roll for your next attack. This helps take the sting out of rolling badly for younger children (and for adults too).\nThe countdown track adds another level of decision making and tactical thinking to the game.\n\nEach hero has a special ability that is activated by putting a token on the countdown track. At the end of each round the tokens will move down one space on the track. You're unable to use your special ability again until your token has moved off the bottom of the track and has come back to you, so you need to think very carefully about when is the best time to use it. \nThe countdown track also has a second use - to add the threat of a spider attack! \nThis mechanism has received some of the highest praise from our playtesters, as it creates tension and ensures the game moves along at an exciting pace.\nEach time you complete a round without having explored further into the dungeon, the \"threat token\" moves down one space on the countdown track. If it ever moves off the bottom of the track then a swarm of spiders appear in the dungeon and start attacking the heroes. The ever-present threat of being swarmed by spiders really moves the action along! \nSharing creativity and fun is at the very heart of CoraQuest, and that is why we not only encourage you to make your own content for the game, but we also encourage you to share it with others too! \n\nWe have a special section on our website where we host community-created adventures, heroes and enemies that people can download and use for free. We already have lots of things on there. For example, acclaimed board game designer Jerry Hawthorne (Mice and Mystics, Stuffed Fables) stumbled across the print and play version of CoraQuest and liked the idea so much that he sent us this awesome band of brave rodent adventurers that he designed and drew.\nJerry's characters will not be included in the CoraQuest box, but they can be downloaded to print and play from the CoraQuest website.\n\nJerry isn't the only one who has sent in their work for us to share on the website though! Look at these fantastic adventurers from six-year-old Enydd Chadwick.\nBe aware that these are the prototype versions of the game. They do not feature the finished artwork and there may also be some small changes made to the rules before final production.\nWhy should I back CoraQuest on Kickstarter?\nIf CoraQuest doesn't get funded on Kickstarter it won't ever be made. This is very much a passion project for all involved and we do not have the resources to make and distribute the game without your support.\nWill CoraQuest be available at retail?\nWe don't have any plans at this time to put CoraQuest into retail distribution, however if the opportunity arises we would consider it.  \nIf the Kickstarter doesn't reach its target will I still be charged?\nNo. You will only be charged if we reach our target.\nWhen will I get my game?\nWe are aiming to deliver the game in late November 2021. We will keep all the backers regularly updated on each stage of the process until everyone gets their games.\nHow long after the campaign ends will you be charging for postage? \nWe will be sending out an email via our pledge manager (Gamefound) around two to three months after the campaign has ended. This is so we can minimise the risk of us charging either too much or too little for postage, as the rates for this can fluctuate.\nWill I have to pay customs charges or tax on my game?\nWe will absorb the costs of customs charges and taxes (including VAT) for games delivered to the US, Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand and the EU so you should not have to pay any additional fees in these areas. Other regions may have additional customs charges as per local regulations.\nHow thick are the Dungeon Cards?\nThe Dungeon Cards are made out of 310gsm card (the same material that high quality playing cards are made out of).  We have found in our playtesting that using cards as opposed to \u201ctiles\u201d makes very little difference to the game, and it also enables us to keep manufacturing and shipping costs as low as possible as they are both cheaper and less heavy - allowing us to pass those savings onto the backers.\nShipping for CoraQuest will be charged after the campaign has ended in order to minimise any fluctuations in the cost of this between the campaign close and the date of delivery.\nThese are the current estimated charges based on quotes provided to us by our shipping partners. However these may be subject to change due to unforeseen international events or changes in law between now (February 1st, 2021) and the time of shipping.\n*There are a number of countries that we are unfortunately unable to deliver to.

You want your wagons to travel as long a distance as possible, because you receive victory points for every section of a track tile they pass. But be careful! Because the common rail network is built by all players in turn, your fellow players could also try to let your metro line run into a destination station on as short a route is possible.\n\nAt the start of the, a frame is placed around the board to indicate where each player's metro line starts. In the center of the board is a central station, and metro lines can terminate here or at the end of the map. \n\nEach tile in Metro shows metro lines going in different directions. On their turn, a player will either place the tile they have in their hand, or they may draw a tile and must place this one. Tiles may not be rotated, and must be placed adjacent to a previously placed tile. \n\nAs soon as a Metro line has connected to an edge station or the central station, a scoring takes place. The owner of that line gains 1 victory point for every tile track it passes. If it passes multiple sections of the same track tile, it generates 1 victory point for each of those sections per track tile. If the line terminates in the central station, the points for that line is double\n\nThe game ends when the tracks of all players are completed which will be at the latest after the last tile is placed. The player with the most points is the winner.\n\nFor more information go to see the game page on Board Game Geek\n\n\nProduction and Delivery\nThe production of Metro - The City Edition and the Deluxe Big Box is planned for Q3  2021.

We guarantee that the product you receive will be complete and all internal components in perfect condition. We will do our best to ensure that your package arrives in good condition, but all decisions on box replacements will be made on a case by case basis.

Become a Good Citizen and defend the public order of your village \u2013 or destroy it with cruel lies and accusations!\nCovid Deniers offers an exciting political spin to award winning games like Werewolf or Mafia. Intense debates, dramatic tension and fun for you and your friends are guaranteed.\nCovid Deniers is designed and illustrated by Pasqual Schillberg (Akademie der Bildenden K\u00fcnste Stuttgart). Video by Kolja Haaf (Filmmaker and Journalist, S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung). Voice by Azeret Koua (Theater Dortmund).\nInfections are spiking out of control, your village is in chaos. The Good Citizens are all worried and follow the government's instructions. Only some Deniers don't believe in the pandemic at all. They keep their infection a secret and try to stay undercover.\nTo start playing Covid Deniers, every player draws a secret role card. The game begins at night. All players are asleep. Only the Deniers are free to open their eyes. Now it\u2018s time for conspiracy. Each night, they can put one Good Citizen into quarantine. One round at night is followed a daytime round.\nAt daytime, the Good Citizens try to find out who among them is a Covid Denier. Within an open group discussion, they decide on one player to be tested for his or her true identity. In the end, either the Good Citizens keep their majority in the group \u2014 or the Deniers take over.\nAdditional roles, such as the Superspreader or the Virologist, come with special abilities and turn Covid Deniers into a viral experience! Our full guide including all rules can be found here.\nThe final game will include additional characters. Beyond that, we have many ideas for even more roles (e.g. \"Q\", \"Hypochondriac\", \"The Donald\") and hope to realize them with your support. Please also feel free to share your own ideas about exciting characters - we might add them during the campaign! \nCovid Deniers is influenced by social deduction games like Werewolf or Mafia. However, it is much more than that:\nBeyond being an outrageously thrilling game, Covid Deniers seeks to be an immersive experience of contemporary politics at heart. You and your friends take part in what is actually happening out there: A fight about truth and trust that trickles down to individual groups of our society.\n   Box items such as the branded masks, wipes and the inch ruler add a unique atmosphere to the game. They also serve a real function throughout the game and contribute to the storytelling power of the players. For details, see our \u201cHow does it work\u201d section.\n  While the basic rules are easy to comprehend for beginners, the various special roles add complexity and depth to the game. Each of the special roles like the Superspreader, the Tester or the Virologist, represent different stakeholders of the pandemic's universe. In the end, we tried to create a well-balanced system of complexity and fun that unites the best aspects of different social deduction games we love.\nCovid Deniers is made for unique and very individual gameplay experiences. You can play it over and over again - tension and fun are guaranteed!\nWe will start the production of the game immediately after the campaign. We plan to ship the final product (box + playing cards) starting February/ March 2021. We don't seek to earn a single buck by shipping the cards and the box. Instead, we will offer the delivery as cheap as possible. We did some research and attached the probable costs. We are confident we can lower these numbers.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have a finished prototype and an agreement with our manufacturer for all details of the product.

The source of inspiration was my father, who was always writing calligraphy in a dimly lit corner to avoid disturbance to others.\nMy job nature requires frequent travelling. There is a need to draw and take product photoshoots on the go. With the advancement of battery technology, I aspired to improve the light and coupled it with more functions.\nDESIGN\nWe have upgraded the CARD Light with functional enhancements and design improvements. The specific features are as follows:\n1. Small & Bright\nWith the dimensions of  86 x 55.8 x 24.5 mm, it's the size of a credit card. The maximum brightness is 2300 lux (@ 23cm.) With 2 brightness for 3 colors, there is a total of 6 modes. 45 degree convergent light caters to personal use without bothering others.\n2.Max & Fast\nBuilt-in 5200mAh lithium polymer battery supports the light to run continuously over 10 hours*. Battery can be fully charged in 2 hours with TYPE-C port, and supports dual USB output port (share 15W PD.)\n3.Easy & Versatile\nBuilt-in Hall sensor switches the light on automatically when unfolding CARD Light. With a single button, you can easily switch the light modes. Flexible structure design allows you to adjust the angles for any purpose. Multifunctional clip is assembled with neodymium magnet and flippable nano-suction Pad. Sturdy base of CARD Light can be fixed anywhere you want.\nSwitch Operation\n Glue Dots Pad\nThe Glue Dots Pad is waterproof, it can be used indoor and outdoor. Consists of a durable acrylic adhesive with viscoelastic properties, make the adhesive tape suitable for most surfaces. Simple peel, and No wall damage. \nWash it with water and dry it to regain its stickiness when the Washable Adhesive Tape gets dirty. The removable double-sided tape is very easy to remove and will not damage your walls or surfaces.\nUsing the Glue Dots Pad \nFeature \nWith that, this is the retrofits of CARD Light that we strive to improve. I have carried DVT sample with me for over a year, and it has become an essential part of my life. If you travel alone and study over night just like me, I would like to share, the best partner, CARD Light with you.\n What Is KableCARD ?\nIn 2018, we successfully launched KableCARD with your support and love. It is as small, light, and multifunctional as a Swiss army knife. People love it! Therefore, we kept the original functions, and upgraded them. Now, KableCARD is not just the same but better.\nWhat Is New\n1. 7.5W Wireless Charging\nWe upgraded the wireless charger output from 5W to 7.5W. With a faster charging speed, more time is saved.\n2. Magnetic Locator\nNew design of magnetic locator for iphone 12 accurately aligns the phone on the charging spot. It supports all iphone 12 series(mini/Pro/Max.)\n3. Silicone Cable + Enhanced Adapter\nWe replaced the cable material with environmentally friendly silicone. It is more flexible and durable than previous version. Being resistant to deformation, you can flex the cable freely to adjust it for different purposes. The adapters are made from upgraded parts (Soldered PCB >>Insert PCB) to enhance the durability.\n4. More Color Options\nIn addition to black and white, we are also introducing new colors, Ruby and Sapphire. The translucent design conveys functionality clearly. Various options to meet your need! \n5. Green Package\nContinuing our practice of green packaging through multifuncional usage, we designed the packaging into a A8 size organizer. Besides storing the KableCARD, it can also be used as a memo book.\nWe appreciate your support for KableCARD. We hope these improvements will bring more convenience and efficiency to your life, and get through this tough year with you.\nREWARDS \n\nSCHEDULE", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDue to the COVID 19, the delivery may not on schedule if shipping problem.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge S$ 2 or more", "title": "Big thanks and stay with CARD", "descp": "Will get update and news from CARD", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}], "stat": ["9 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge S$ 39 or more", "title": "new KableCARD", "descp": "Get a new KableCARD ( 4 color options)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["272 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge S$ 66 or more", "title": "CARD Light", "descp": "Get a new CARD Light( black or white 2 options)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["127 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge S$ 99 or more", "title": "new KableCARD+ CARD Light", "descp": "Get a new KableCARD(4 color options) & CARD Light( black or white 2 options)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["271 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge S$ 144 or more", "title": "EarlyBird of CA4 PRO + CARD Light", "descp": "Get a CARD adapter 4 PRO( 45W TYPE-C(PD)+3 USB A) & CARD Light ( black or white 2 options)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["20 backers", "Limited (80 left of 100)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge S$ 150 or more", "title": "CA4 PRO + CARD Light", "descp": "Get a CARD adapter 4PRO ( 45W TYPE-C(PD)+3 USB A) & CARD Light ( black or white 2 options)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge S$ 177 or more", "title": "FULL SET", "descp": "CARD Adapter 4 + new KableCARD +CARDlight", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["99 backers", "Limited (1 left of 100)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge S$ 33 or more", "title": "EarlyBird of new KableCARD", "descp": "Get a new KableCARD ( 4 color options)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "100 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge S$ 60 or more", "title": "EarlyBird of CARD Light", "descp": "Get a new CARD Light( black or white 2 options)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "100 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge S$ 93 or more", "title": "EarlyBird of new KableCARD+ CARD Light", "descp": "Get a new KableCARD(4 color options) & CARD Light( black or white 2 options)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "100 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #8", "update_userinfo": "We are still in the midst of shipping~ \ud83d\udea2", "update_content": "Hello our dear backers!\nWe are glad that some backers have received their parcel! :) Do leave us some reviews on the comment page :)\nSlow but steady shipment\nMeanwhile, for the others, we are still in the midst of shipping out the rest.

TVs aren\u2019t always convenient so we made a way to take console gaming with you wherever you are without the need of an internet connection.       \n\n\n\nAs lifelong console gamers, we know there may be some PC master race gamers who gawk at the idea of playing Mario on their powerful gaming computer.  But we say the more games we can play, on even more platforms, the better! \nSeamless console docking to your laptop. It's that simple!\nLaptops are Really Versatile Screens\nThe biggest benefit of course is to take advantage of the screen you\u2019re always carrying already.  Not one of those additional portable monitors but a laptop that we use daily for like\u2026 school, work, shopping and creative stuff. \nShadowCast completely hides in the shadows of the original Switch dock!\nLet's imagine a time before 2020... and you were waiting at an airport for a flight to board and you wanted to get a couple rounds of Smash Bros in with a friend\u2026 or two\u2026 or three. Tabletop mode is nice\u2026 but let\u2019s just say it\u2019s not the most ergonomic. With ShadowCast you can easily plug your Nintendo Switch to your laptop and play on a screen over 4x the size.\nNot quite as easy as adjusting the viewing angle of a laptop, is it?\nYou Could Always use Another TV\nThere's also many situations where there just isn\u2019t a HDMI display available - many of us are happy with our laptops and integrated desktop computers. I think back to the times when I lived in a dorm room or even living abroad for brief periods where having my laptop, a PS5, and a ShadowCast would\u2019ve been amazing. \nWorks with current-gen and next-gen with up to 4K input\nAnd then there\u2019s always competing for the living room television - whether it\u2019s someone in your household streaming a whole season of the latest Netflix series or just having another gamer in the household. Oh and it also makes having a second television for multiplayer that much more convenient to set up. \nPS5 on an iMac - when a TV just simply isn't available\nOur App Makes the Difference\nAccompanying the ShadowCast is our new Genki Arcade app. We literally have made it easier than reaching for the TV remote and hitting the \"input\" button. We've designed Genki Arcade from the ground up to minimize computing resources and prioritize latency for gaming performance. Just open the app, and it'll auto detect ShadowCast and you'll be playing immediately without any settings to fiddle with.\nTV vs. ShadowCast - HDMI splitter shows a 0-0.02s difference in Smash Bros.\nGenki Arcade (left) is 50ms faster than OBS (right) and uses less than 1/3 of the CPU\nWe've developed a native Mac OS app that's optimized for both Apple Silicon and Intel processors as well as a dedicated app for Windows. Additionally, we're in the process of making a web browser version that allows you to play on shared/public computers and other systems without installing any software (compatibility will vary, for example iPadOS currently doesn\u2019t detect external video devices but we\u2019re confident it will someday!).\nWindows or Mac, we got your Animal Crossing addiction covered\n The beauty of being able to connect your gaming console to your computer means you can actually record, edit, and stream your gameplay. While it may not be at the same level as a professional grade capture card that costs 5-10x more, it\u2019s more than capable for most gameplay capturing needs while being much more flexible and easy to use across multiple platforms. \nWe're making last year's best capture cards feel a bit outdated.\nRecord To Your Heart\u2019s Content\nSure you can use the built-in video recording feature on the Nintendo Switch but that\u2019s limited to 30 seconds - that mean you'll have to rush that epic boss fight or finish that speed-run extra fast.  It's is also a pain to export and you\u2019re limited by an already small internal storage and expensive memory cards. With ShadowCast you don't have to worry about recording length and can rewatch your whole session of Among Us, add your commentary, and refine your strategy.\nWith a 30 second limit everyone is sus!\nWe\u2019ve actually created what we believe is the most simple to use, not just for playing but also to record gameplay videos.  Here\u2019s a sample of a recording of us playing on various consoles with the ShadowCast: \nThese videos are screen recordings of gameplay played off an early build of our dedicated Genki Arcade app.\nPlays Nice with Others \nWe made the Genki Arcade app to be truly simple to use, but for those that need more complexity you\u2019ll be happy to know that ShadowCast is compatible with popular professional capture card applications such as Open Broadcaster Software (OBS), Streamlabs OBS, XSplit, and much more. This will allow you to capture video with detailed customizations and even overlay various webcam feeds, graphics, and animations.\nIt's pretty much compatible with everything you throw at it\n\nBegin Your Career as an Influencer\nUltimately the main reason for anyone to capture video is so that they can share it with the world. ShadowCast can easily upload your previously recorded or edited videos and even stream live to your favorite platform - whether your team Twitch, YouTube, or FaceBook, we got you covered.  \nTo maximize compatibility across as many platforms as possible, we\u2019ve disguised ShadowCast as a webcam so that it can do a few more party tricks. This means it can actually be selected as a webcam under many typical apps popular today thanks to all the remote working, including Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and FaceTime - and further even supports video players like QuickTime and VLC if you don\u2019t have our app installed.\nVideo Chat Your Gameplay\nThis allows you to not only share your gameplay live with anyone, but you can actually play with your friends and see them on split screen just as if you were playing in couch co-op mode in-person.\nYou can play any of your favorite games in split-screen even without being on a couch\nDon\u2019t Settle for a Weak Webcam\nAs an additional benefit, ShadowCast works with all HDMI output devices beyond gaming consoles, including better cameras.  This means you can upgrade your video conference by swapping out your poor built-in webcam for most digital cameras, including DSLRs, camcorders, and action cameras - as long as it supports HDMI out (some cameras require a HDMI-mini/micro converter).  No more grainy, low resolution videos with poor lighting. \nKickstarter compresses these images, but hopefully you get the idea!\nThe Perfect Stay-at-Home Camera Assistant\nIt\u2019s also quite useful for situations where you just need to see what you're photographing or recording on a bigger laptop screen - no need for expensive wireless monitors! \nA better view of your DSLR in real-time so you can skip the expensive screen monitor\nWe actually had the idea of ShadowCast back in 2019 and started to collaborate with  manufacturers of the top video streaming and capture card brands. The timing was a bit too early as the components needed were overly expensive and had originally intended to make a Super Dock. Since then, we've refined the idea, dived into software and made something that we're quite excited to share here.\nMight as well make it as small as possible right?\nHere's also a video showcasing the latency between a TV and ShadowCast. We setup a powered HDMI splitter to show the screens simultaneously with the same baseline:\nPLAY\n\nSetup ShadowCast in 3 simple steps!\nIf you need a more visual adventure we've prepared a short video showing the 3 simple steps in real-time to setup ShadowCast.\nPLAY\n\nThis is really, really small\nDimensions are 25 x 52 x 9mm or 0.98\" x 2.1\" x 0.35\"\nWeighs just 10 grams (latest prototype)\nHDMI 2.0 input brings in 4K video from the latest game consoles, including the Nintendo Switch, Playstation 4/5, and XBox Series S/X\nUSB-C output transfers to computer up to 1920x1080 @ 60fps\nGenki Arcade app requires macOS 10.12+ or Windows 7+\nIncludes USB-C 2.0 Cable 1.8m long cable\n\n\n Get more ShadowCasts if you wanted various colors or one for every console:\nGet a Covert Dock, a pocketable dock and GaN charger for the Switch and more:\nGet a Genki Audio, connects 2 Bluetooth headphones to your Switch (and other consoles) works docked, and has a port to charge your Switch:\nGet a Genki Audio Lite, a slimmer portable Bluetooth audio adapter that is optimized for the Switch and Switch Lite (does not fit PS5): \nGet a Force Field Lite, a dual magnetic enclosure grip case with vegan leather to protect your Switch Lite with compatibility for both Genki Audio and Audio Lite: \nIf you're in need of a flexible HDMI, premium USB-C 3.1 cable, or portable metal stand: \nGenki was a brand founded by three guys with a dream to challenge the gaming accessory industry to make more compelling hardware.

This time, we\u2019ve actually gotten a lot of the work done before launching the project which means greater financial risk for us but a lot less timeline uncertainty for our backers.

With each new game, we will add a new reward level allowing backers to get all of the games at these Kickstarter discounted prices.\n\nTHE FOLLOWING GAMES ARE AVAILABLE AS OF NOW:\nAhead In The Clouds by Daniel Newman\nAnthelion: Conclave of Power by Daniel Solis\nAntinomy by John Baluci\nArcane Bakery Clash by Robin Gibson\nHandsome by TC Petty III\nHierarchy by Hugo Kawamata\nLiberation by Jon Simantov\nRagemore by Bojan Prakljacic\nSeasons of Rice by Corry Damey\nSmoke & Mirrors by Chip Beauvais\nSupertall by Nat Levan\nWhy I Otter by Aaron Andrew Wilson\nEach of the games below has some video content, but this amazing video covers both Antinomy (24:05) and Liberation (26:40), so instead of repeating it we'll just show it here. Although, with the number of views on it, I can only imagine you've already seen it. :)\n\nLet's jump into the available games!\n\n\n/an-tin-uh-mee/ noun\n(A contradiction between two beliefs or conclusions that are in themselves reasonable; a paradox)\nAs a Sorcerer, you have long sought ancient relics, imbued with  magic. What unspeakable power can you unleash when you collect relics  from anywhere in the spacetime continuum?\nAntinomy is a head to head battle of wits as 2 competing sorcerers in search of powerful Paradox Crystals. Play a single card from your hand using the color or symbol to dive into the  past, or use the number to fly into the future. The card you land on gets swapped with the card you played allowing you to build up a winning hand. Wherever you go, clever card play and a set of 3-of-a-kind cause paradoxes forming crystals of your own. Or confront your opponent in a clash to wrest control of their crystals. Collecting 5 of these crystals will ensure your control over space and time. Do you have what it takes to wield the power of Antinomy?\nEXPANSION AVAILABLE: Solo Flare (solo play) - Add it during checkout for just $2 (normally $4).\n\n\nIt's been a long time coming. You and a particular co-worker at  the Arcane Bakery simply cannot work together anymore. In a moment of frustration, you challenge them to a duel: After close, no holds barred. The loser resigns... and cleans up the mess.\nArcane Bakery Clash is a resource management game, where your resource is time. Specifically, time to cook the magical treats that you will use against your co-worker. You can choose 2 actions per turn, and you will either put a recipe card in the oven, peek into an oven (in case you forgot what you started cooking), turn up the heat (and advance the track on the back of a recipe card), or take a recipe out of the oven (putting the card into play). With these actions you will bake new treats that are used to either reduce your opponent\u2019s health, heal yourself, or allow special actions. When a  player\u2019s health is reduced to zero, they lose the game, and their opponent wins!\nEXPANSIONS AVAILABLE: Mystery Ingredients (more cards) and Boss Bake-Off 1, 2 and 3 (solo play) - Add them during checkout for just $1 each (normally $3)\n\n\nFor  hundreds of generations, the tyrannical Intercosmic Dynasty has ruled  the galaxy with a titanium fist. Their power and reach is spreading, but  so is word of their misdeeds. A band of resistance fighters known as  the Liberation has begun striking at the Dynasty from a hidden base.  Will you help the Liberation gain enough support before their secret  base is discovered, or will the you wield the awesome power of the  Dynasty to hunt down these traitors and bring them to heel?\nUsing a tiny deck of only 18 cards, Liberation plays out a miniature rebellion of galactic scale on your tabletop. An  asymmetrical game of cat and mouse, the Dynasty player expands their web  of power, occupying and exploiting planet cards, while the Liberation  player strikes from the shadows, sabotaging the Dynasty\u2019s hand and  performing daring missions. The odds are long and the stakes are high.  Can you stall long enough to cycle through the deck 3 times, earning  enough support to topple the Dynasty, or will you scour the galactic  map, tightening the noose around the secret base of the Liberation to  attack and destroy them? The future of the galaxy is at stake!\nEXPANSIONS AVAILABLE: Warped World and Moon of Mystery (more locations and new abilities) - Add them during checkout for just $2 and $1 (normally $4 and $3)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n$20,000 Stretch Goal - UNLOCKED! Ahead In The Clouds\nThe  citizens of the Empacta skies long for  the days where everyone, not  just the wealthy, can ditch their masks  and breathe the precious air  that they call their home.\nAs an industrialist, you will collect dust  particles from the air  and water vapor from the clouds to convert to  hydrogen and oxygen.\nBy collecting, converting and selling these  precious resources,  you can provide your family with the breathing  room that you need to  keep your business afloat and go home at night  knowing you made a  difference to the world with fresh air.\nIn Ahead in the Clouds,  each player can  take three actions each turn. Options are either  taking/converting  resources via connected buildings or Cloudbursting,  which is breaking up  the established network of buildings. Players can  also take free  actions during their turn to claim contracts to gain  victory points, or  connect their habitat to other buildings. Players  must also be ready for  the blimp from below, which comes every couple  of rounds to take  resources back down to the land dwellers.\nAfter 8 rounds, the player with the most contracts wins.\nEXPANSIONS AVAILABLE: Tents Trackers and Contracts (more variety) - Add it during checkout for just $1 (normally $3).\n$25,000 Stretch Goal - UNLOCKED! Supertall\nIn the heart of the city, steel beams race skyward. While other cities sprawl endlessly outwards, these city  planners are looking up -  up - UP! Real estate prices are skyrocketing, and it\u2019s time for a new class of skyscraper, the \u201cSupertall\u201d, to reshape the skyline.\nIn Supertall,  2-3 players are competing  developers, presenting their plans for new  skyscrapers. Featuring 18  Plan cards with various amenities, players  draw 1 card each turn and  must choose to add it to their skyscrapers,  pass it to their rivals, or  leverage it for special abilities. Once all  the plans have been built, players score points based on the mix of  Residential, Business,  Entertainment, and Green Space amenities in  their skyscrapers. However,  due to constant lobbying, City Hall will  heavily tax one of those types  making it worth 0 points, so be sure to  plan ahead. The player with the  most points using hard work and good  planning will rise to the top, in Supertall!\nEXPANSIONS AVAILABLE: Municipal Buildings (variety and 4th player) and Spires if Supertall (new scoring) - Add them during checkout for just $2 each (normally $4 each).\n$30,000 Stretch Goal - UNLOCKED! Seasons of Rice\nIn Seasons of Rice, Corry Damey\u2019s 18-card   tribute to his Cambodian  heritage, players are  farmers puzzling  together paddy cards to expand  their family\u2019s  \u201clandscape\u201d of rice  paddies and ensure the most  bountiful of harvests.\nPlayers will be drafting cards and placing them into their expanding   landscape area to close off paddies in order to score the most points  by  the end of the game.\nEXPANSIONS AVAILABLE: Jasmine & Ginger and The Water Festival (adds new setup and goals). Add them during checkout for just $2 (normally $4 ).\n$35,000 Stretch Goal - UNLOCKED! Smoke & Mirrors\nSmoke & Mirrors is a bluffing game for  2-5 players. As the  greatest magicians in the world, players  will  compete for the top spot by trying to go bigger and better than the  previous magician using a limited number of tricks. But the players need  to watch how much they share, because once their secrets are revealed, they are out!\nPlayers each get 3 trick cards, from 3 different decks. They must use these cards to create a magic act that has a trick value of one  number higher than the player to their left using any amount of their cards. If successful, the players continue, building more and more dangerous magic acts. The winner is the last player standing.\nEXPANSION AVAILABLE: Smoke and Mirrors: Deduction (adds a 4th suit and new elements). Add it during checkout for just $2 (normally $4).\n$40,000 Stretch Goal - UNLOCKED! Why I Otter\nThe river is filled with otters of all  shapes and sizes. Decide which otter should jump into the river at the  right time to maximize  your score. Having the winning otter gets you  more cards, but losing lets you pick the scoring conditions.\nWhy I otter.....\n $45,000 Stretch Goal - UNLOCKED! Hierarchy\nIn the Kingdom of Darkhill, order and  power mean everything. The royalty reign supreme, but alongside of  their control are the plotting  citizens, planning to get ahead using  any means possible.\nHierarchy is an abstract game of order and power where players each  take a random set of 7 cards and play them openly, until they cannot  play any more. Cards must be played atop a card of a lesser value, unless either the last card - or the currently played card change those rules. When the active player can no longer play a card, their  opponent has won the game and has taken the seat of power away from their opponent.\nEXPANSION AVAILABLE: Emissary (adds solo play). Add it during checkout for just $2 (normally $4).\n$50,000 Stretch Goal - UNLOCKED! Ragemore\nEvil had beset the village, and we were  their last hope. We could not ignore our duty, so we set out on one last  quest. We fell one by one, until I was the last survivor. Holding  steadfast, I swung my axe one last time. As I crashed to the ground, I  knew I had found, at last, peace.\nRagemore is an 18 card solo game where you will complete quests, while managing  your hand and resources as you delve though the dark, fighting demons,  all in a span of 10-15 minutes.\nEach card is two sided; a demon and a hero. In the beginning of the  game, the player will set up 2 piles of demon-sided quests and a party  of 3 hero-sided cards. Then an immediate threat is revealed from the draw deck as the current demon card that may or may not be dealt with.  If it is not killed, the demon card will go to one of the quests piles   and an event written on that card will take effect. If it is killed,  the  demon card is flipped to the hero side and becomes one of the  party. The player can also ignore the immediate demon threat and goes on  a quest to obtain the win condition, or parlay with some of the demons  to turn them into heroes but with the cost of the hero's morality: the  hero  is flipped to the demon side and joins the draw deck of demons.\n$55,000 Stretch Goal - UNLOCKED! Handsome\nYou are invited to an evening of wordplay.\nIn Handsome, you will create words using a common pool of letters and personal letter cards from your hand.\nHowever, to score points, you're not only trying to create the longest word, you're trying to create words using the most cards of a single suit. With three suits available to score, every round you will see multiple opportunities for each player to score. The game ends when a player reaches 9 points.\nEXPANSION AVAILABLE: The Brilliant Expansion (adds word types and a tiebreaker card). Add it during checkout for just $2 (normally $4).\n$60,000 Stretch Goal - UNLOCKED! Anthelion: Conclave of Power\nThe sun is setting on one of the most devastating battles the Pocket Universe has ever seen. After years of fighting, it is becoming clear that this war will not be won on the strength of military victories alone. The leaders of the Dynasty and the Liberation turn their attention to some of the most influential figures in the galaxy to strengthen their  cause.\nWho will be able to consolidate their power, gain new allies, and turn old foes to their side? Who can form a Conclave powerful enough to gain control of the Universe?\nAnthelion: Conclave of Power is a game for 2  players who choose two unique special character abilities on their turn to manipulate the locations of the characters in play. Players seek to pull characters from all factions, good, evil and neutral to their side  of  the table (their Conclave), or push unwanted characters to their   opponent. The player that can amass ten  points of influence by  getting enough characters to cross all the way to their side of the table will be declared the winner.\nAnthelion: Conclave of Power builds on the foundation of the two-player influence manipulation game Avignon: A Clash of Popes.\nEXPANSIONS AVAILABLE: The Androids and The Folk (both add a new faction and planet). Add it during checkout for just $2 (normally $4).\n\nStretch Goals\nWe normally don't do stretch goals, but it's the entire point of this campaign! Each stretch goal will unlock a new game, which backers will vote for in the comments. When a new game is unlocked it becomes part of the pool of games you can choose from at the end of the campaign. Keep an eye on the updates to vote for your favorites! Here are some potential stretch goal games (and even more that aren't shown here).\nWe will pick about 3 at a time and ask you to vote for your favorite through the updates here.

Feel free to ask in the comments about others experiences, as we rarely hear of fees on the recipient end. But with the changes in the UK, it's hard to tell what to expect. \nAdd-Ons\nWe usually offer a range of Add-Ons through our website, but these reprint campaigns can become very complex. Every single order is unique, and it makes fulfillment quite a beast. \nSo in order to keep things simple, we are offering two featured add-ons, Sprawlopolis and Tussie Mussie. We will add them into the mix of games at the end of the campaign and you would just choose them in your survey. Since both of those games are in stock now, you may prefer to order them at our website and receive them sooner. To do so visit http://www.buttonshygames.com and use coupon code 0121backer to receive 15% off of your entire order wther you get those games or not. :)\n\nBoard Game of the Month Club\nWe have an awesome following of repeat customers. As a result, we've built the Board Game of the Month Club. \nIt's a subscription service where you receive unreleased microgames,  promo cards, expansion content, and Kickstarter discounts ... every  month! Supporters also receive from $1 to $10 off EVERY WALLET GAME that we make. (Members back our Kickstarter projects at the $1 pledge level above and see the recent Patreon post for your specific discount.)\nOur 2020 $5 packages include an episode of Personal Space, a solo game that has multiplayer interactions. It's part roll and write, part campaign, part digital, part real life, part fantasy. There are stickers and everyone receives some unique cards and unique combinations of cards. It's been live for a few months now, and it's our most  ambitious project yet and it will emerge until Feb 2021.\nThen, we are starting up a new year long game in March. It's called The Final Lightyear.\nIn The Final Lightyear you'll play solo or cooperative with a friend, as the  captain of a so-called starship, in hopes of earning some rewards and a decent rep. Using tactical maneuvering and dice-based action selection, you'll work through the sector's small, medium and large enemies trying to gain rewards and ultimately live to see another day. Customizable episodes will challenge you with variable enemies and threats while  offering powerful new gear and talented crew to help you in your adventures.\nOur $10 packages include all of the above and something extra.

We've been able to minimize these errors in recent years, but they can happen from time to time. We've also upped our pre-press staff internally to make sure we can hit intended deadlines.\n\nWith COVID-19 some of our suppliers have been delayed, so we've been allowing additional time in our estimations and setting up backup suppliers as well. Our local staff is working while socially distancing, so we are allowing additional time for a smaller staff to assemble and ship games. \n\nOur two unfulfilled projects are moving along according to schedule. Our Agropolis Campaign is scheduled to be fulfilled in March and backers are up to date with the progress.

Only GHOST, a special government unit, can oppose the machine revolution, but it seems the whole city is conspiring against them.\nBecome a part of GHOST and fight for the survival of your kind... no matter which one it may be!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPLAY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways in the majority at the beginning of the game. They want to protect the network with blue firewall data chips and finish their mech \"Apex\". Sometimes they lose their advantage by other factions secretly recruiting humans.\n\nAlmost always present, just in small numbers. They want to contaminate the network with red virus data chips, as well as destroy all resources in the warehouse of the humans. At the same time, they want to build their secret weapon \"Deus\", which can carry the 'Human Punishment' virus directly into the network, if nobody should stop it. During the game, the Machines get information about who the Humans are and can even recruit 1 human if they are understaffed.\n\nIf the Legion is in the game, they start alone, but they have several ways to infect 1-2 players. Secretly, the Legion is working on lowering the city's security level as low as possible or raising the enemy threat level as high as possible. To accomplish this, they use their emerging followers called Crawlers, while also using some other sneaky tricks.\n\n\nSometimes 1 character is secretly Fallen. Through wrong tracing and misinformation, they try to send grey spam data chips to the junkyard or into the network. The Fallen character is always alone in his team, but their victory conditions overwrite those of all other factions and therefore make them unpredictable!\n\n\nOutlaws suddenly appear out of all corners of the city. Coordinated attacks are very untypical for them. Due to their massive presence they significantly reduce the city's most important assets and increase the danger on the streets. Who controls them from the shadows?\n\n\nEven though the government has always been breathing down our necks since GHOST SQUAD was founded, and would have loved to take the project to the moon, they are now very grateful that we exist. We worked hard to put together the perfect team, and it was anything but easy. Everyone on the team has exceptional talents, and they have mastered all the tasks we set them with bravura. Everything was demanded of them, both physically and mentally, so that they are ready for the worst-case scenario.\n\n\n\nThe Beginning is a complete and independent gaming experience. However, there is the option to combine it as a full-length campaign with Human Punishment - Social Deduction 2.0. The concept of combining two independent games from different genres is new. We call this a 'Connecting World System', or CWS for short. Through CWS, you will experience the beginning of the Human Punishment story with The Beginning. Throughout this journey, your decisions and actions will create specialized conditions and unlock unique outcomes, which then affect how the next game in the campaign is played: Human Punishment - Social Deduction 2.0. Here, you play the big final battle and write your own story, which thanks to all the variables, will be different every night!\nKeep in mind that your loyalty is also maintained from Game 1 to Game 2, so between the games you will not be able to avoid trash talk. A unique evening awaits you!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe welcome verified retailers to carry Human Punishment - The Beginning.\nFor more info on bulk pricing and shipping discounts, please contact us at sales@godot-boardgames.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProduct design\nAesthetics are important to us, but usability is paramount.

Cooperating with Ortholite\u00ae, the world-renowned insole manufacturer, we designed a dual-layer insole - The top side that touches your feet is Merino wool and the bottom layer is full of air pockets that support your feet with a lightweight structure.\n2. Talent Jogger uses ultra-lightweight, rubberized EVA for its outsole compound. \nA unibody construction such as this, provides both excellent abrasion performance and running-shoe elasticity.\n3. Our original Hive-Impact\u2122 outsole construction is the core innovation occupying the rear 2/3rds of the outsoles. \nWith hexagon cavities, this design reduces even more weight from our insoles.\nWhen combined, these innovations greatly reduce the weight of the overall shoe while still providing comfortable, all-day support. A pair of Talent Joggers is on average, 15% lighter than a typical pair of wool sneakers.\nA pair of Talent Joggers is on average, 15% lighter than a typical pair of wool sneakers.\nAccording to our ergonomics research, the proprietary Hive-Impact\u2122 technology makes the rear 2/3rds of the outsole considerably more stable and structurally more rigid, while retaining the flexibility of the forefoot section.\nThe hexagon structure also supports your feet better than a traditional solid outsole when you walk, or even during jogging. \nIn general, with our cutting-edge technologies, Talent Jogger can keep strong support for at least 18 months.\nMerino wool is prized for footwear because it naturally wicks away moisture while remaining breathable. It continuously absorbs small amounts of liquid into its fibers, then wicking moisture away through small openings in the woven fabric.\n This results in a shoe that is never too hot, eliminating perspiration build up and leaving your feet dry and comfortable.\n\nThe unique open-cell structure of Ortholite\u00ae foam creates a moisture management system, helping to remove moisture and provide a cooler, drier, healthier environment. It also contains active anti-microbial agents to prevent fungi from growing inside your shoes.\nTalent Jogger are the ultimate in comfort for bare feet.\nMerino wool is easy to care for. Talent Joggers may be cleaned in your washing machine and air dried.  (Shoelaces and insoles are still recommended to wash by hand separately)\nSustainability is part of our mission.\n1. Merino wool can be fully recycled and is often reused as material for carpets.\n2.

The EyeQue VisionCheck 2 is the most convenient way to check your vision anytime, anywhere with real-time results. Use the personalized results to order new glasses online and track vision changes over time. This powerful smartphone attachment uses MIT-patented technology to measure your refractive error and provide EyeGlass Numbers - the lens power needed to correct nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. The VisionCheck 2 comes with the PDCheck pupillary distance measurement tool so you can quickly and accurately capture your PD and order glasses with ease.\n*NEW! Now the VisionCheck 2 can test for reading vision, commonly know as near-vision ADD (NV ADD). This ADD number can be used for reading glasses, bifocals, or progressive lenses.\nVisionCheck 2 is the world\u2019s only do-it-yourself smartphone-powered refractive error test. Some claim to have online or app-based refraction tests, but they are merely prescription verification services based on visual acuity estimates. EyeQue users are actually performing a self-refraction test while proprietary algorithms process, personalize, and store results. Leveraging the power and ubiquity of smartphones, the mobility of VisionCheck 2 brings accurate vision correction to billions of people, many of whom lack access to traditional vision care.\nSound too good to be true? Here's how to use it:\n1. Download the iOS or Android app and sign up for an account.\n2. Slip the VisionCheck 2 device onto your smartphone and follow simple on-screen instructions to start a test.\n3. Look into the soft eyecup. Look for the red and green lines. Use the buttons on the device to move them and overlap into one solid yellow line. \n4. Once you are satisfied that the lines are fully overlapped, click on the \"enter\" button and gently rotate the thumb wheel to the next position. Overlap the lines again and repeat. The test consists of 8 measurements per eye.\n5. See your results- EyeQue EyeGlass Numbers\u00ae (EGNs). \nHere's an example of what your EyeQue EyeGlass Numbers\u00ae (EGNs) will look like:\nWe are delighted to show you a proof of concept prototype video of the VisionCheck 2:\nPLAY\n\nOnce you have your EyeGlass Numbers, the next step is to measure your pupillary distance using EyeQue\u2019s PDCheck.\nPDCheck\nVisionCheck 2 includes another product called PDCheck. An accurate measurement of pupillary distance (PD) is necessary to order eyeglasses. If the measured PD is wrong, you will find the glasses uncomfortable and it will make you feel dizzy, it can sometimes even lead to headaches. Our patented PDCheck technology uses the smartphone camera to take a \u201cselfie\u201d and extracts the PD to an accuracy of +/- 1 mm.\nHow do you use PDCheck?\n1. Download the iOS or Android app and sign up for an account then start a new test. Next, you should put on the PDCheck frames.\n2. Center your face inside the oval and take a picture. \n3. Adjust the markers to the center of your pupils and T marks (if needed) to get the most accurate PD. Receive your pupillary distance measurement instantly! \nOnce you have your EyeGlass Numbers and your pupillary distance, you can get Try-On Glasses or get new glasses online using your EGNs!\n\nOur Try-On Glasses are custom made in California. \nAt only $19 (shipping included), they are a low-cost, super-fast way to experience how well your EGNs and PD will work for you.\nSubscription\nEyeQue smartphone-vision tests require an annual membership subscription. Your active subscription provides unlimited vision testing, unlimited access to your vision data, and exclusive access to other EyeQue products and services. An All Access membership for our VisionCheck (1st generation) and Personal Vision Tracker devices is currently $4.99 per year.

As promised, you are grandfathered into membership for life with your existing account.\nFor our many existing EyeQue customers, including those who have the VisionCheck (1st generation) with an active recurring All Access membership of $4.99 a year, we\u2019ll have special options for you to extend your current membership rate for years to come. Stay tuned for more updates.\nYes, yes it does! Here's how the technology works, in a nutshell. \nThe VisionCheck 2 is based on an MIT patented technology licensed exclusively to EyeQue. This technology has been extensively tested in previous generations of our products and uses a variant of the inverse Shack-Hartmann optical method.\nThe original Shack-Hartmann method is used in an optical device called \"autorefractor\" and trusted by eye doctors around the world. The autorefractor, short for \"automated refractometer, is used to give a quick estimation of vision correction. You may recognize it by its iconic \"hot air balloon\" or \"barn house\" image. Many of the optical principles and components used in the autorefractor are also used in the creation of the VisionCheck 2.\nThe device projects two beams of light that comes from the smartphone display into your eyes and onto your retina. Using an interactive interface, the user overlaps the two lines to form what looks like one yellow line.\nBased on the amount of pixel movement made to fully overlap the two lines into one yellow line, EyeQue calculates the user's refractive error. Proprietary algorithms then process results once a full test is completed. After three or more consistent tests are taken, EyeGlass Numbers\u00ae are calculated and presented in the same format as a traditional prescription with the spherical, cylindrical, and axis powers needed to correct nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism.\nUsers have performed approximately 150,000 tests using this proprietary technology. Hundreds of testimonials and thousands of surveys from VisionCheck customers helped inform product updates to VisionCheck 2. We set out to create a refraction device that's easier to use, with more accurate results, and better optics.\nBased on the feedback of our members, \u202fwe came up with a brand new form factor, app design, and test screens \u2013 nearly every aspect of the user experience has been reimagined.\nWe're proud to announce that the VisionCheck 2 was named a CES\u00ae 2021 Innovation Awards Honoree in two categories\u2013\u202fHealth & Wellness, and Mobile Devices & Accessories\n\n A more interesting test taking experience with new backgrounds: A new background channel features a variety of customizable animated images that help you get more accurate results. \n Larger, brighter, easier-to-see lines: A better optical system allows the display lines to appear larger and crisper than the lines in the previous device, making them easier to see, therefore improving test efficiency and accuracy. \n Easier to attach clip system: A convenient clip that's compatible with most phone cases allows the VisionCheck 2 to easily attach to any phone without interfering with any buttons or Popsockets.\n Easy to rotate thumb wheel design: A new, purely mechanical, easy-to-rotate thumb wheel design allows you to proceed to the next test without having to take your eyes off the device, so you can maintain focus and complete the test faster. Plus, testing has been reduced from 9 meridians down to 8 meridians, making for a faster testing process.\n Upgraded eye cup design: A redesigned, ergonomic eye cup helps filter more light for an easier test taking experience. \n Tactile buttons: Redesigned test buttons on the VisionCheck 2 improve the ergonomics of the test taking experience. The new buttons also eliminate the need to connect your device to your phone via Bluetooth - this also eliminates the need for batteries, so you don't need to charge the VisionCheck 2.\n Brand new app: A reimagined app design maximizes usability. The new app includes educational elements and makes it easier to reach support.\nThe MIT-patented technology powering the VisionCheck 2 has been extensively tested with over 150,000 tests over the past 3 years and has been optimized to give excellent refraction values for ordering eyeglasses.\nMoreover, at-home vision test results can be more accurate than a single point-in-time refraction test. Since your vision fluctuates throughout the day, taking multiple tests at different times of the day gives a better average refraction than a one-time refraction test during an office visit. Especially if someone is having a bad day!\nReal VisionCheck and Try-On Glasses users share their stories. \nDan:\nPLAY\n\nMichael:\nPLAY\n\nEyeQue has a family of vision testing products that work together to equip you with everything you need to order eyeglasses.\nWe cannot explain the science without explaining the human eye first. Nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism occur when the eye lens and eye distance are \u201cout of sync\". Normal distance vision is the result of the light entering the eye and focusing exactly on the retina, where the brain interprets sharp images. Common deviations from normal vision include nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. Nearsightedness, or myopia, occurs when the lens focuses the light before your retina. Farsightedness, or hyperopia, occurs when the lens focuses the light past your retina, both causing the brain to interpret \"blurry\" images. Almost 50% of the human population has some degree of nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism. These conditions are also known as \"refractive errors\".\nThe EyeQue VisionCheck 2 is an optical device that achieves the effect of a variable corrective lens as it translates pixel spacing on the smartphone screen to corrective powers. To simulate the effect of converging or diverging rays into your eye that a correction lens would provide, you simply move the pixels on the screen closer or further, emulating the effect of a corrective lens. The goal is to overlap the red and green lines and create a single yellow line. Think of the VisionCheck 2 as a custom converter of pixel spacing to optical power. Using that conversion, VisionCheck can determine corrections from + 8 D to \u2013 10 D.\nVisionCheck 2 uses your smartphone's display to work. A pixel spacing on the order of .07 mm (70 microns) or better is needed \u2013 the diameter of a human hair. VisionCheck 2 works well for phones down to 326 Pixels Per Inch (PPI). Any PPI below 326 means that the resolution is too low for it to be optometrically accurate.\nThe iPhone 6S, for example, has an adjacent pixel spacing of 21 microns, and about 63 microns between same color pixels. With this small pixel spacing, VisionCheck 2 exceeds 0.25 Diopter resolution. As a reference, 0.25 Diopter accuracy is the level typically achieved by Optometrists.\nWhile it is easy to understand how EyeQue can measure the overall optical power for nearsightedness and farsightedness, VisionCheck 2 also gets an accurate measurement of astigmatism by sampling over different angles. To measure astigmatism, a complete set of power measurements is comprised of 8 measurements for your right eye and 8 measurements for your left eye. Measurements are made at increments of 45 degrees and with these measurements, the astigmatism is computed.\nYes, that\u2019s a lot of measurements, but the device is making measurements of tiny differences that reflect the shape of the eye lens and cornea. About 1 diopter of astigmatism, a typical value, implies that the non-spherical component of the eye is about 0.25 mm. 0.25mm is thinner than your average ball-point pen point.\nAll computations are carried out in the EyeQue cloud as it takes a substantial amount of computation that is dependent on many different parameters including the smartphone you are using. As you take more tests, the results are aggregated together through averaging and removing bad data points. Each test is scored based on the goodness of the computed fit to the measurements. An example of test results is shown below.\nAlong with your test results, we also provide you with a measure of the consistency. The plot on the right also shows how other users have performed as shown by the relative size of the blue dots; most but not all users fall into the \"good\" category. Our personalized vision report is a great way to stay in touch with your test results and vision changes.\nSeveral EyeQue products, including the first-generation VisionCheck, have undergone clinical studies regarding their accuracy. We are in the process of publishing our findings (spoiler: they work extremely well) and will share them with our backers as soon as we can.\nIt all started with two friends who shared a vision.\nToday, EyeQue has a team of dedicated scientists, engineers, marketers, designers, and support professionals helping advance vision care, one pair of eyes at a time. \nEyeQue\u2019s Medical Advisory Board provides guidance on the Company\u2019s services, products, and programs with a particular focus on identifying opportunities for EyeQue to serve and partner with the medical community.\nThe board provides insight into the current and evolving vision healthcare environment, helping EyeQue to pinpoint the specific needs of healthcare providers, serving patients from within and outside of the doctor\u2019s office, where EyeQue technologies could be used to serve those needs in a meaningful way. The board is comprised of distinguished Ophthalmologists and will expand to include additional representatives as EyeQue\u2019s business evolves.\nA Mission to Bring Affordable Eye Care to Everyone\nWe\u2019re putting accurate vision tests directly into the hands of people around the world. Our patented technology makes self-administered eye tests available to billions of people \u2013 many of whom may not have had the ability to test their eyes and correct their vision without access to low cost, convenient solutions.\nA Global Need to Raise Our EyeQue\nIt is estimated that more than sixty percent of the world\u2019s population are vision impaired. Hundreds of millions of people, adults and children, are challenged daily by the discomfort and struggle of normal tasks like reading, studying, working and caring for their family. In fact, the global economic cost of lost work productivity due to people with poor vision has been estimated at 700 billion dollars per year.\nRefractive error, which eyeglasses correct, is the number one cause of vision impairment in the world. Yet for many families in many countries, access to an optometrist is limited or even non-existent, and the costs associated with obtaining corrective eyeglasses are not affordable. Sometimes corrective eyeglasses are not even available. Our goal is to enable anyone, anywhere in the world to self-administer an accurate refractive measurement test. With our advancements in technology, the mobility of the testing platform, and the commitment to affordable vision solutions, EyeQue will empower people all over the world to easily access and inexpensively correct their vision and improve their daily lives.\nMyopia (or nearsightedness) is the most common cause of blurry distance vision. If uncorrected, myopia can increase the risk of developing more serious vision problems including cataracts, glaucoma, retinal detachment, and macular degeneration - all of which threaten sight. Yet this condition is easily corrected, and progression can be slowed with corrective glasses.\nA closer look at this myopia epidemic:\nUncorrected refractive error has been steadily climbing and is now the second most common cause for blindness (~20%), with the first being cataracts (~35%).\nWe\u2019re taking the growing myopia epidemic head-on by rapidly developing and distributing innovative at-home vision tests and devices.\nOur Road is Long and Unpaved\nWe introduced the first at-home smartphone-powered refractometer in October 2016. With our continuous customer feedback in mind (primed by our Kickstarter backers!), we're on schedule to deliver our third generation refractometer in a few months.\nEyeQue's Goals\nEmpowering people to test their vision as often as they like in the convenience of their home.\nArming the optometry, ophthalmology, and optician industries with technological advancements to improve patient care by enabling remote vision monitoring.\nBringing vision testing to areas of the world that lack standard eye care and allowing people to correct their vision with eyeglasses.\nEyeQue is also actively seeking non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to use our technology to expand their reach and enhance their services, particularly in areas lacking eye care professionals.\n This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere is minimal risk to this project.

Over the course of three ages, each composed of a variable number of rounds of play, you will choose one of six possible actions to take. \n Simultaneous Action Selection: All players choose their action and reveal at the same time; if any player is the only one to choose a specific action, they get a bonus! See if you can anticipate what other players are doing so you can gain an advantage that will allow you to take over the Kingdoms! \n Escalating Shark Attacks: All players can control the shark's actions so you want to make sure that the shark is close enough to take out your opponents but far enough away that your creatures are safe! As the game goes on, more sharks are added to the game and the waters become increasingly dangerous! \n Variable Scoring Conditions: Each age, there's a different way to gain points and the goals change at three times in the game. There are goals that are based on being on the board in specific spatial patterns, for specific types of terrain, and for having specific actions of your species upgraded, among other things! There are three goals per game and every game is very different based on which goals come up. \nCan you outthink your opponents to seize the Kingdom?\n And Add-on your custom water Animeeples!\nIn English: \n\nIn Spanish:\nKingdoms of the Deep Overview\nEach player controls one of the undersea factions and starts with control of one type of terrain. \nEach turn, players simultaneously select from 6 possible actions to play. \nPlayers reveal their actions at the same time. Anyone who was the only player to choose that action will get a bonus, which depends on the specific action. \n\nPlayable actions are:\nMove:  Move any of your own creatures, your opponent's creatures, or even the shark! If you choose to move a creature into Atlantis, you get a bonus point.\nDeploy:  Place a creature onto a tile that either has at least 1 of your creatures on them or is adjacent to a hex with your creatures on them. \n- Creatures are placed one at a time, so you can travel across the ocean kingdoms quickly with this action.\n\n Bolster: Place cubes onto tiles that are your terrain focus. This allows you to place a lot of creatures out quickly.\nUpgrade: You may upgrade one action (move, bolster, deploy, etc) on your player board. This will allow you to do more the next time you select that action AND can grant you extra bonuses as well. \nShark: Take control of the shark! Use shark actions to move the shark or have the shark eat up creatures! These can be  (yours or your opponent's)! \nReset: Take all your played cards back into your hand! Previously played cards cannot be reused until you reset! \n- Depending on how the player has upgraded their Reset action, they might also get to do a variety of things when they reset.\nEvery turn a reset is played,  the Age marker is moved on the game board. Once the age marker is moved three times, the age ends! \nAt the end of an age, players gain points if they control capital cities and from Goal cards. Goal cards can award points or actions, then the next age begins! \nAfter three ages, the game is over. \nScore the final round and reward bonus points to whoever has the most creatures in Atlantis.\n\nThe player with the most points is crowned Monarch of the Undersea Kingdoms! \nRulebook\nYou can check out the (not finalized) rulebook here https://www.dropbox.com/s/ox5om7oxr56567w/Kingdoms%20of%20the%20Deep%20Rulebook%202020-11-26.pdf?dl=0\nhttps://www.gameosity.com/2021/01/21/kingdoms-of-the-deep-kickstarter-preview/\nWatch the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-w1788w8U\nRead the Review http://www.purplephoenixgames.com/kingdoms-of-the-deep-preview/\nWatch the Video https://youtu.be/DtqjcTgCsvU?t=402\nWatch the review below!\nWatch the review below!\n\n\nReviews coming soon! \n Lost Kingdoms: Pangea in Pieces \n200 million years ago, dinosaurs roamed the massive supercontinent of Pangea. But the Earth slowly began to break apart. As the lands shifted, these great beasts moved across the globe, seeking new homes to ensure the survival of their species.\nLost Kingdoms: Pangea in Pieces is a game of tile laying, tile shifting, and area control. Each player directs a different species of dinosaur, competing to have the most dinosaurs on each of the ever-changing landmasses.\nRoar and Write! \n It\u2019s time for the Selection Committee of the Animal Kingdom to choose the new monarch to rule over all. Now it\u2019s up to you to appease the five council members on the Selection Committee to win the Regency. The catch...each Committee member is appeased in a different way, so you must choose wisely as you can only appeal to one each Age.\nRoar and Write is a competitive press-your-luck game about impressing different council members on the selection committee, garnering favor throughout the five kingdoms, and completing your own personal objectives to rise to the top of the selection committee's choices for the new ruler of the Animal Kingdoms.\nPeople sometimes wonder why they should back a Kickstarter campaign instead of waiting to get the game later in retail. The most important reason not to wait with Kingdoms of the Deep is that even if Kingdoms of the Deep funds, we currently don't know if Kingdoms of the Deep will go into distribution. If you wait, you may end up missing out, as we won\u2019t have many extra copies to sell and unless your local store backs the campaign, they won\u2019t be carrying it either.\n Kickstarter Limited \u2013 Kingdoms of the Deep might be very hard to find after the campaign, outside of select conventions. \n Help Us Improve Kingdoms of the Deep \u2013 We have a ton of stretch goals planned to help improve the game for everyone!\n Discounted \u2013 After the campaign, we will sell the extra copies at a higher cost.\nMost importantly, without you, Kingdoms of the Deep would not get created.\nKingdoms of the Deep is a game we love and want to share with the world. We have been working on this game for several years to make it the best it can be. Kingdoms of the Deep brings together the things you loved from Animal Kingdoms and adds on a depth that we know you'll enjoy. We love playing and know you will, as well.\nWe really appreciate your support in making our dream a reality.\nWe would love to support game stores by offering the Kickstarter versions of Kingdoms of the Deep to retailers during the campaign. Back the project at the retailer level for $50, and we'll contact you closer to when we ship out rewards to get a count of games that you wish to get! An invoice will be sent to you before we ship your rewards.\nWe will be charging shipping after the campaign ends. This ensures you get charged the shipping you deserve. No more, no less.\nBy doing this, we are able to factor in your pledge tier, add-ons, and all fancy things that may occur during the campaign. However, we can offer estimated shipping costs. Below is estimated pricing for one copy of the game.\nPlease keep in mind these are estimates and there can be slight variations from country to country. Also, the more items you purchase, the more shipping will cost. If you have any questions, please email us at support@galacticraptorgames.com.\n*We are currently not planning to ship to the following areas: Mexico, Brazil, and Russia.\nTo order a second copy of Kingdoms of the Deep, add an additional $39 to your pledge with no additional shipping cost.\nWe are happy to discuss group orders, but these need to be handled on a country-by-country basis. Please send us a direct message including country and number of copies to discuss.\nWhat do you get when two board game publishers who love outer space and dinosaurs join forces? Galactic Raptor Games! That\u2019s right, Carla Kopp of Weird Giraffe Games (Tumble Town, Fire in the Library, Stellar Leap, Dreams of Tomorrow) and Dan Letzring of Letiman Games (Adventure Tactics, Groves, Neverland Rescue, Dino Dude Ranch) have joined forces to publish under their joint venture Galactic Raptor Games.\nOn top of our already successfully fulfilled game, Animal Kingdoms, we have both been in the industry for years and have delivered a combined total of 18 Kickstarter campaigns between the two of us. Combining our strengths will lead to a bigger and better future for our companies and for more fun games getting to your tables!\nWe love getting to know our community better, so be sure to connect with us on social media and say hi!\nKingdoms of the Deep is the third project by Galactic Raptor Games.\nThe Kingdoms of the Deep team is made of the following people:\nSTAY UP TO DATE ON KINGDOMS OF THE DEEP\nCheck out Kingdoms of the Deep on Board Game Geek  \nJoin our discord server \nFollow Galactic Raptor Games on Twitter \nLike Galactic Raptor Games on Facebook  \nFollow Galactic Raptor Games on Instagram \nJoin the Weird Raptor Discord Server ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAlthough Dan and Carla individually have already successfully funded and delivered 18 projects on Kickstarter, Kingdoms of the Deep will have it's own unique issues.

All card counts are subject to change. All card and component names are subject to change. All packaging is subject to change. Rules are subject to change. \n\nAs the game has not been manufactured yet, all images and descriptions are what we are aiming to create. It is possible during the production process that some items might change in appearance, functionality, size, or quantity. We will attempt to keep such changes to a minimum. \n\nFULFILLMENT \nBezier Games, Inc. has been publishing boardgames for more than 10 years. Several factors can cause delays that are beyond our control, including manufacturing issues and shipping delays. The COVID-19 pandemic could be a factor in possible delays; in all cases, we've tried to incorporate a reasonable level of padding into shipping estimates. \n\nThe estimated fulfillment is December 2021, but keep in mind that this is just an estimate, this year more than ever before. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others. \n\nRESTRICTED DELIVERY \nDue to increased frequency in Kickstarters failing to deliver to certain locations, Bezier Games, Inc. has decreased the amount of locations Kickstarter rewards may ship to. This is because of several reasons - the majority being issues of reward packages getting lost, stolen, being unable to clear customs. In addition to this, some countries have been removed due to heavily increased accounts of piracy. \n\nBezier Games, Inc. will only be shipping to the following locations: United States of America, Puerto Rico, Canada, United Kingdom, Europe (European Union, Albania, Andorra, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Georgia, Iceland, Kosovo, Liechtenstein, Macao, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, San Marino, Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, Vatican City), Australia, New Zealand, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan, Philippines, and Military (APO)\n\nSHIPPING\nShipping is charged after the KS campaign concludes, based on the actual costs Bezier Games incurs to ship from distribution centers to your delivery address. All shipping & handling costs will be paid by backers through our BackerKit Pledge Manager. Links to this pledge manager will be sent roughly two weeks after the campaign ends. The BackerKit pledge manager is a 3rd party used to finalize orders and shipping outside of Kickstarter, Kickstarter has no responsibility in this regard. Shipping costs vary based on where you will have your reward delivered; we always do our very best to ensure backers the best price possible. \n\nAt the start of this campaign, we expect the box included with the Collector level and Royal level to be about 300 x 300 x 160mm (similar to the Suburbia Collector\u2019s Edition \u201cregular\u201d box) and weigh about 11 pounds. The Colossal level includes the same box, PLUS an additional box which we expect to be about 300 x 300 x 148mm, shipped together in a single carton weighing about 26 pounds. The shipping estimates below reflect these calculations.\n \nRegional applicable taxes will be calculated in the Pledge Manager as well. Our shipping is US, CA, EU, UK, AU friendly meaning rewards will ship from within these regions. Any VAT for EU and UK will be collected in the pledge manager.\n\nREFUNDS \nBezier Games, Inc. will do whatever they can to minimize the risks but, should a backer become uphappy, we are willing to refund pledges if issues should arise while the Pledge Manager is open. Refunds of 100% of collected funds are available within the first 14 days of a campaign's end. Past that, Kickstarter still needs to collect their portion of the pledge which we do not cover. This results in a 90% refund given if it is requested after the 14 day period. Once the Pledge Manager closes, refund requests will be reviewed on a case by case basis. \n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed. Bezier Games, Inc. is not responsible for changes in the rate of foreign exchange. \n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS \nBy pledging to this project, you agree to conduct all public interactions via Kickstarter's communications channels with this project and our team and other backers in a positive manner. Harassment, name-calling, or attempts to inject inappropriate content into the public communications channels will not be tolerated. Bezier Games, Inc. reserves the right to cancel any pledge. \n\nIf we ship to the address that you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is returned to us as undeliverable you may be required to pay the full cost to ship your reward again to a revised address. \n\nIf we ship your reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package tracking status shows as delivered to that address, but you are unable to receive it, or you have moved and are no longer the occupant of that address and cannot otherwise retrieve the package, or if the package is lost or stolen after delivery, and you wish to have the order fulfilled again, you may be required to pay the full cost to ship the order to a revised address in addition to the amount of the original reward including any add-ons and other upgrades on your order. \n\nIf we ship the reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is held in customs or by any other government agency, our ability to help may be limited. You may be required to contact your customs agency or government and arrange for the package to be cleared and released at your expense. We are not responsible for any fees levied against your pledge by customs or any government agency. We are not responsible for any refunds or re-shipments for packages held by customs or a government agency. \n\nOther than as noted elsewhere in these terms & conditions, if any part of your order cannot be fulfilled for any reason Bezier Games, Inc. will provide you with a pro-rated refund for that portion of your order. \n\nIf you do not log in to our Pledge Manager and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. Bezier Games, Inc. reserves the right to deny or fulfill orders beyond these 8 weeks under our discretion.

We have seven full-time employees and four part-time employees. Like so many of you, we had various plans last year which were disrupted.  We pivoted into a ton of live coverage instead.  This year our goals are to:\n Continue to produce regular live content on a set schedule \nIncrease interaction with our listeners\n Continue to increase the quality of our current YouTube shows \n Produce more top ten lists with special guests \n Upgrade our equipment \nYou might notice that these are very similar to our goals in 2020, and that's because I want to focus even more on the quality of our streaming.  The Winter Spectacular was something we worked hard on, and we believe we can bring ALL of our content up to that level.  In this campaign, we have a myriad of cool rewards but we hope that your main goal in supporting this campaign is keeping the Dice Tower on the air.\nWe are dedicated to keeping the show and our videos free for download and viewing, and we appreciate you helping us in reaching that goal.  We ask you to consider giving above and beyond the cost of the rewards to maximize what we can do this year!\nPLAY\n\nGoing beyond our goal will allow us to do more for you on the channel!  Here are some of our stretch goals!\n\nWe have a pile of wonderful rewards to send out to you as a gift for backing our campaign.  We know the value of these rewards does not come close to the amount you are donating to the show but they are simply a small \"thank you\" gift that we are sending as a token of our appreciation.  We also ask that you look at them that way - to donate money to the show is the main goal of this campaign.\nThe following promos each have their own pledge level, but also can be added to a regular pledge.  Simply add the amount to your pledge and you can choose which ones you want at the end of the campaign.  Realize that some add-ons will accrue more international shipping at the end of the campaign.\nThere will also be some add-ons that are only added on in the pledge manager.  These will include (but are not limited to) promos from last year, and more!\nWe can only fit in a limited number of these rewards, so they are unlikely to be available in the pledge manager after the Kickstarter.\nEach Thursday, we do a live show of Boardgame Breakfast!  Want to show us up in the trivia section?  Backers will show up live in one of our Thursday Breakfasts for the game show section!\nWant your own Dice person?  Tina will draw you (based on a picture you send in) in the color die of your choice.  This is for non-commercial use, although the Dice Person may show up in a future Dice Tower video!\n\nPLAY\n\nA set of four (4) custom card trays.  These will hold at least 45 sleeved (American sized) cards and 60 unsleeved cards. Design isn't final - they will be clear plastic (same material as our component bins).  You will be able to push down on the cards to easily pull out the top card.  \nA custom monster for use in both King of Tokyo and King of New York!\n A new scenario designed for Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion!

This set will be available this year only.\nTina also created custom art for Werewolf cards!

Tom's favorite roles are included, as well as one or two new ones!\nGet our new 2021 Playmat!  (Dimensions - 23.75\" x 14\")   \nGet our larger new 2021 Playmat!  (Dimensions - 25\" x 20\").

You step up as the new ruler of your kingdom. Everything seems quiet at the beginning. You want to be a good ruler and do your best for your kingdom.  But you are surrounded by neighbors, and each of them wants to be the most powerful king in the region. They attack you, try to rob you by unfair trades, and crush your kingdom down. You need to fight back or your kingdom will fall down ingloriously.\nEach player controls a kingdom which is represented by the state of four resources - Influence, Wealth, Citizens, Military. The goal is really simple - either develop all your resources to their maximum or destroy your opponents by decreasing one of their resources below the minimum. But they are trying to do exactly the same.\nThe main mechanic is around collecting and playing the right cards at the right moment, complete successful trades with the other players, and prepare your defense wisely. Sounds simple enough, right?\nThere are several advanced rules which can be mixed up together and play the game the way you like it. There's also a special section about role-playing which can be included as well if you feel so.\n\nGameplay\nThe players take turns in which they can perform one action:\ndevelop the resources of their kingdom\nattack one opponent and harm their resources\ntrade with an opponent\ndo nothing and draw a card\nThey can play a combination of up to 4 cards. The more cards played the greater the effect of the cards is. However, each development or attack can be blocked by any other player.\nTrading is tricky. It can either help you collect the cards you need or you can be looted by your opponents.\nThe aim of the game is to become the king of the most powerful kingdom. So you need to increase all your resources to the maximum or slay your opponents by lowering one of their resources below the minimum.\nGameplay\n\nAdvanced rules\nThere are six advanced rules which can be mixed with the core game:\n Leader \u2013 include Jokers to help you build card combinations.\n Change in seasons \u2013 the weather can sometimes be unpredictable and either helps your kingdom or put it to test.\n Act of God \u2013 once in a while you experience an event so strong that you can\u2019t blame anybody but the gods. Their will can bless you or crush you down.\n Time shift \u2013 the deck you play with never runs out of cards until there\u2019s one clear winner.\n Kingdom party \u2013 bring up to four players to the table.\n Tell the story \u2013 describe what happens with your kingdom during each turn. This one is for the role-playing fans.\n\n  How does it stand from the crowd?\nRise: A tale of kingdoms uses something which probably we all have at home \u2013 a deck of standard playing cards. The cards offer incredibly high replay value and unlimited possibilities. What the game does is to translate a deck of standard playing cards into a board game. There are only two assets you need \u2013 a scoreboard for each player and a table to translate the cards. The rest is left for your imagination.\nThe core idea of the game is to present you with something so simple that you don\u2019t need to wait to be manufactured, delivered to your door, or even printed(if you don\u2019t have a printer you can literally draw what you need in 5 minutes on a piece of paper and reuse it for all your games). The game finds a balance between simplicity and challenge. Each game is different than the previous one and the setup takes less than a minute.\n\nWho is this game suitable for?\nRise: A tale of kingdoms is a game that can attract any player. It can be played by 2-4 players. The sessions are between 5-30 minutes. The game has the benefits of the games with standard playing cards \u2013 high replay value and super easy setup. You can start a session immediately after the previous one. Probably it\u2019s not a game that you will spend a whole weekend with your friends. But it\u2019s a game that you can play every day on and on. The advanced rules can add a unique taste to each game. You can use none, any, or all of them and play the game the way you like it.\nDon\u2019t forget the optional role-playing. Then tell the story of your kingdom and how it went through days of glory and how it slayed the opponent\u2019s armies.\n\nThe idea\nI created this game during the long periods of staying at home during 2020 (you all know what I\u2019m talking about). I was bored and I wanted to have a game which is simple and I can play with my wife in short sessions. I\u2019ve got inspired by the role-playing zine Beak, Feather, & Bone. It presented me with the idea of using standard playing cards mixed with board game elements. It just opened a whole new world for me.\nEvent though Rise: A tale of kingdoms is not a complicated game, it took significantly more time to develop it than I expected. I was naive to think that it\u2019s something which can be done in a weekend. Actually, it took me several months (of course I was doing that in my free time). But I really like what I did in the end. I hope you\u2019ll like it, too.\nRewards\nThere are 3 options for the bakers.

He also loves to 3D print and paint miniatures, most of which can be found on his Instagram @paintman_journeying.\n\nTabletop Simulator Adaptation\nPedro Feijao is a Mathematician turned Computer Scientist turned Bioinformatician, with a passion for video and board games. Originally from Brazil, after living in Germany for a while he settled in Vancouver, with his wife and 10-year-old son. Now working on a DNA-based Cancer diagnostics company called Canexia Health. In his spare time, he likes to play board games with my family, play basketball and program TTS mods for great board games!\nWhile there's a long way to go with the project still, I want to take a moment to thank all the people who have helped me get this far, from playtesters to enthusiastic fans. From people who played the game at virtual conventions this year, to people who have followed along on my newsletter. \nBut there are a few people I want to take an extra moment to give a shout-out to. \nThe Calgary playtesting community! Everyone who (pre-pandemic times) would come down to Sentry Box for playtesting nights and lend their time to playtesting The Transcontinental. But in particular, Paul Saxberg, Orin Bishop, Keith Donaldson, and Joseph McDaid (who also put together the trailer video here), put in countless hours and sessions on this game. I couldn't have done it without all their input. \nDuring this pandemic time, I've also helped out tremendously by having an online game design group to not only playtest but to act as a sounding board for ideas and to keep me accountable: Mark Yuasa of Test Coast Games, Marc Bennett, and Russel Fleming.\nA special shoutout as well to Chris Ewington, who, in addition to playtesting, helped out with working through some of the logistics of the Kickstarter campaign. \nThanks to Pedro Feijao for rescuing me from doing my own Tabletop Simulator scripting, and doing such a fantastic job with it. \nAnd lastly my wife and son, for their support and inspiration. I consider myself fortunate to live in a home with so much creativity. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile this is my first Kickstarter, my background includes some time in logistics and fulfillment, so I'm familiar with a lot of the challenges that could come up, and I'm partnering with companies experienced with board game kickstarters for every step of the process, from manufacturing to shipping to fulfillment. \n\nWith the help of my partners, I've priced out both our base version as well as all stretch goals, freight and end-shipping. I'll have some artwork to finish up based on campaign input for cards, but proofing of other components (wood, boards, tiles) will begin immediately after the Kickstarter. Final proofing and manufacturing will begin after the Chinese holiday break, with delivery set for summer of 2021.

Meet, \nSmall, Fun, and Functional!\nNoise Machine is a super-duper teeny tiny wireless Midi Controller that doesn't compromise functionality for portability.\nThe main idea of Noise Machine was to create a portable instrument that had the same functionality as a keyboard in a package that you could easily take with you. Something fun to play, compact and functional that could accompany you on the bus, out for a walk, on a road trip, in a tree, you name it! Noise Machine works by wirelessly connecting to software on your smartphone, laptop, or PC/MAC. Consisting of 12 buttons, a knob, and a slider, Noise Machine allows you to choose from 12 different midi channels and offers 3 different modes of use...  All in a case that's smaller than your wallet!\n  Noise Machine was inspired by the need to have a tactile instrument outside of the studio without limitations!\n\nSpecial Offer,\nRecieve 7 Free Sample Packs from Pyro Audios Library for all New & Existing backers! \u2728\nAll you have to do is back, and you'll get a download code on Friday December 4th for 500+ samples that you can experiment with Noise Machine!\n- - -\n\"Pyro Audio is proud to offer a powerfully inspiring collection of sounds for backers of the Noise Machine ultra-portable wireless MIDI controller.

Plus, more surprises! \ud83d\ude09\n\n\nThe Hardware, \nGeneral\nConsisting of 12 buttons, a midi expression knob, and a slider, Noise Machine packs a lot of punch in an insanely small size! Utilizing ultra low latency BLE MIDI and entirely self contained, Noise Machine offers 100% wireless freedom to connect to major DAWs on a variety of different devices!\n12 Buttons \nNoise Machine comes equipped with 12 quiet, comfortable, and tactile buttons that will make you find any excuse to start mashing & making NOISE wherever you are!\nMIDI Expression Knob\nNoise Machines MIDI Expression Knob controls modulation by default, however you can reprogram it to do whatever you like! Cutoffs, filters, or even something as simple as volume. Twist away!\nOctave Slider\nUtilize Noise Machines Octave Slider to explore 7 different octaves across 12 notes in default mode. Stay in one octave, or jump between a few to open up even more possibilities!\nNoise Machine comes equipped with 3 integrated midi modes to choose from out of the box! Consisting of DEFAULT MODE, SPLIT MODE & LOOP MODE. \n\nDEFAULT\nDefault mode turns the 12 buttons included with Noise Machine into the 12 octaves of music theory (C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B). \nThe octave of the 12 notes can be changed with the octave slider, allowing 7 different octaves to be enabled on the fly.\nThe midi expression knob is set to modulation by default, but can be changed via software to control any Midi CC information.\n\nSPLIT MODE & LOOP MODE\nSPLIT MODE,\nSplit Mode is very similar to default mode. The key difference? The first 6 buttons are hooked to channel 1 and the last 6 buttons are hooked to channel 2. This change in layout allows you to play two different instruments at the same time, completely seperate from each other!\n\nLOOP MODE,\nOur take on a midi sequencer. Loop mode allows you to play any sequence of notes and have them played back to you at varying BPM (controlled by the midi CC knob).\nThe Octave Slider turns into a Midi Expression Slider while the loop is being played, letting you modulate the loop in real time!\nLoop Mode lets you add up to 16 notes/pauses and is perfect for a live environment.\n\nThe Nitty Gritty,\nUses form of low latency BLE MIDI (7.5 ms - 10 ms latency).\nChargeable via USB TYPE C, with charging indicator.\nCompatible with IOS, ANDROID, PC, MAC and synthesizers through MAC/PC Software.\nPower, Connect, and Channel LED's.\nOpen Sourced -- Through Arduino IDE.\nDimensions*: 54.3 x 60.3 x 11.4.\n* in Millimeters...yes!

The idea of having a portable midi machine that you could create, engage, and bring with you anywhere was the spark to the eventual creation of Noise Machine itself.\nGetting this far was not easy...\nThe countless hours spent hunched over our desks tinkering, building, and coding are testaments to how passionate we are about this project.\nWe went through six or seven different prototypes in the year and a half that elapsed from the first conceived thought of Noise Machine. These prototypes varied in size, functionality, and features (some were pretty wacky...), all of which culminated in the Noise Machine that you see today!\n  Noise Machine was unveiled back in May of 2020. In September of 2020 THIS.IS.NOISE Inc was founded as a vessel to carry Noise Machine towards its Kickstarter goal.\n\nWhy THIS.IS.NOISE Inc exists,\nUltimately, we come from a world of tangled wires, complex ecosystems, and bulky hardware. We realized that sometimes it's nice to have a break from that world and be able to simply, effectively, and creatively convey our musical abilities... not confined to one space.\nWe hope to pass on this feeling of creative freedom to our fans, and hear all the amazing things they can create wherever they may be.\n\nNoise Machine will be shipped worldwide,\nShipping will be charged after the campaign, where you can also confirm your rewards, address, and choose any add-ons. \nPlease note, that our prices do not include local taxes, duties, etc. that will be subject to the laws and regulations of each individual country/area. \nWhat is the shipping costs?\nShipping costs will be paid separately closer to the date of the shipping on our e-commerce platform. Due to the coronavirus, shipping prices are uncertain as of right now, so we cannot predict the exact cost in regards to shipping.\nWe currently expect the prices to be between$10-50 depending on the shipping area. We will do our best to streamline the shipping process, so you get the lowest prices and fastest delivery times!\n\nA HUGE thanks to our community, fans, and supporters who submitted art, graphic design, and video art during our call to action back in September. \ud83d\ude4c\nWe've attached the community fan art gallery below with props to the talented creators... You guys rock! \u270a\n@dangertapesky\n@yellow_salamandr\n@Anonymous\n@m.ssing_no\nPLAY\n\n^ And this awesome vid by @animoscillator! ^\n\nWe'd like to take a second to thank everyone that has decided to join us on this exciting journey! \nWhether you have just joined us for the first time, or you've been with us since the start, we have a deep appreciation for you helping us bring the music industry into the Portable Revolution...

Your objective as a deep-sea researcher is to guide your sub through fathoms of water, descending to the Trench floor, to find mysterious and amazing sea creatures.\nWill you become a renowned research scientist, or will you fall victim to the creatures that lurk beneath the surface?\nINTRODUCTION\nThe goal of The Mariana Trench is to score the most research points by researching deep-sea creatures and the floor of the trench. The game is played in alternating turns until your submarines run out of oxygen. \nMOVEMENT\nMovement from one card to the next represents a distance of 1000 Fathoms. At launch your sub can move up to 2000 fathoms (2 cards) on your turn. \nCOLLECTING RESEARCH AND UPGRADES\nWhen researching the water column, reveal the (research) card next to your sub. Each card displays a deep-sea creature and a submarine upgrade. \nYou may:\n\u2022 Collect the deep-sea creature, or\n\u2022 Upgrade your Submarine\nIf you do not collect the creature or upgrade your sub then leave the card face-up, where either player may collect it on a future turn.\nIf you have hold capacity you may tuck the research card under your sub (to the right), so that the class and size of the creature shows.\nIf you do not collect the sea creature then you can upgrade your sub. Tuck the card under your sub (to the left) so that the upgrade is showing. You cannot take the same upgrade twice.\nYour sub starts with a small hold, which can carry one small creature. To collect large creatures you must upgrade your hold first.  \n\nTHE TRENCH FLOOR\nEach time your sub reaches the trench floor you can conduct valuable scientific research. Take 1 research token from the supply and place it on your submarine. Your sub can only carry one research token at a time. The token is offloaded as soon as you surface beside the research vessel.  Research tokens are worth 2RP at the end of the game.\nRETURNING TO THE RESEARCH SHIP\nWhen your sub surfaces, all the creatures and tokens are offloaded to the research vessel. At the end of the game points are scored for different sets of creatures\nAnd there is more\u2026.\nOK, so we have the game, the expansion, and the play mat, we have a few awesome stretch goals to come too\u2026. But what else?\nOver the past three years I have been hugely fortunate to work in the board game industry, I\u2019ve had games published, I\u2019ve worked as an illustrator and designer on many fantastic and exciting games. \nBut now is the time, the time for me to develop the games I\u2019d like to play, the games I think you would like, games I'm passionate about which I'm itching to throw my creativity and time into. By backing this project, you are giving me the opportunity to exclusively make the absolute best games I can for you.\nWith two more amazing games in the pipeline for next year, I am massively excited for the future, I've got some amazing stuff to share. So, it\u2019s not all about buying this game, it\u2019s about investing in creative freedom and being part of an exciting journey and some amazing new games.\nTris Rossin.\nOwner of Bright Light Games.\n The cost of shipping will be charged after the campaign has ended in the pledge manager.

You can back from anywhere in the world at any tier\nThe House Doesn't Always Win - Front Cover (Design by @minus_tom)\nWhat is The House Doesn't Always Win?\nReclaim your lands, bring down oppressors, topple empires...\nThe House Doesn't Always Win is a zero-prep, tabletop role playing game about those who have been left with nothing fighting against those that hold everything. It runs entirely on a standard deck of playing cards and a single 10-sided die, can be run in any setting or theme and uses a unique, poker-like system to drive its game-play. The House Doesn't Always Win will transform your deck of cards into a high stakes game of pushing your luck and fighting against your oppressors. Sessions are full of heist-like plans gone awry, fragile allegiances between allies around the table beginning to crack under pressure, and constant morbid curiosity for exactly what card is currently sitting on top of the deck.\nA completely unique set of mechanics designed from the ground up to fit your characters' struggles... \nThe House Doesn't Always Win is built on a unique set of mechanics that bring your deck of cards to life. The diamonds are your targets, those you need to destroy to remake the world in your favour. The Kings, Queens, and Jacks are your characters, those fighting to change what keeps them down. Everything else is all the influence, allies, favours, equipment, and luck you've managed to scrape together to attempt this paradigm shift. Once the game starts, it's not just how the cards are dealt, but how you play them that will ultimately decide your fate. \nDefy the odds or die trying in a world where the slightest mistake can cost you everything...\nWhat you're attempting is not going to be easy, in fact, it's an enormous gamble, but if you liked the odds you wouldn't be here in the first place. The House Doesn't Always Win is a game of high tensions and situations that exist on a knife-edge - where failure is always avoidable but takes no prisoners. The odds are always changing as cards are discarded and removed from the deck and with everyone sharing the deck between them, every action is important, not just your own.\nA spade, heart and club come together to burn down the heraldry of their oppressors. (Art by @riotbones)\nHow does it play?\nFast setup and easy to understand rules remove the barriers between the players and the game...\nThe House Doesn't Always Win strips away the need for pages and pages of rules that most games require you to learn without sacrificing interesting moment to moment decisions. Suitable for advanced TTRPG players looking for something different as well as new players looking for a fast and easy to learn system - It's fast to pick up and set up and is infinitely repayable in whatever setting you choose, suitable for quick and deadly one-shots or multi-session narratively linked campaigns. \nA series of interlocking mechanics, all hiding within a simple deck of cards...\nEverything in The House Doesn't Always Win will have you keeping your attention on the deck of cards in the centre of the table:\nThe diamonds are removed from the deck at the start and all the picture cards of that suit will represent the targets you'll need to take down in your campaign; the head of the snake must be removed to kill the constricting body. \nNumbered diamond cards are laid out on the table and represent important pieces of information, contacts, and assets that the diamonds covet; find and claim them during play to manipulate the odds in your favour. \nCharacter creation is as simple as choosing a card to play as; Jack, Queens, and Kings all have their own unique powers and your chosen suit will aid you in challenges to come and inform how your character plays.\nAttempt risky and dangerous actions by drawing from the deck one card at a time, looking to draw a certain amount of cards in one of three suits. Draw too many of the wrong suit and you risk going bust and losing every card you've drawn for the rest of the game, permanently weakening your chances and possibly even removing characters from play. \nAn innovative 'folding' mechanic allows you to pull away from potentially devastating actions when the risk becomes too great - swapping boring, single chance dice rolls for a nail-biting, push-your-luck, extended draw that could see glory or tragedy with every card taken from the deck. Actions have consequences, not just in the narrative, but in the mechanics themselves. \nThe House Doesn't Always Win feels like...\nA hitman level run by a croupier, a high stakes game of poker mixed with Russian roulette, classic heist movies, David taking down Goliath, putting everything on black, knowing you stand to gain or lose everything, knowing you have no other choice. \nYou'll shout in triumph and cry out in agony from merely turning over a card. Your characters will suffer hardships and if they're lucky, narrowly escape with their lives, but should they succeed against all odds; their names will go down in history.\nA spade looks ahead at the gauntlet that awaits them before the King of Diamond's tower.

It\u2019s only a matter of time until the allure of Corruption becomes unstoppable, in all its devastating effects.\n\nStrategic choices will be crucial for the destiny of Faeriell and for your Tribe of Weybits. Will you cooperate with other players or part ways?\nThese are photorealistic renders. Please take into consideration that the final product may differ.\nFor an extended and detailed explanation of the rules, check this video:\nWatch below an English Playthrough of the game:\nInspired by the lush nature of Faeriell, we will involve our supporters in the Tree-Nation project, aimed to reforest areas of the world in need. The Tree-Nation Add-on gives us the opportunity to plant new trees and see how our efforts will improve the environment. Everyone involved will be able to see how much the CO2 levels will decrease in the new forest region.\n  By choosing the Tree-Nation Add-On, you will receive a certificate that proves your contribution for planting a tree, with its geo-localization. Our partner, Tree-Nation, will provide additional information about the results of the overall project. Let's plant a forest together!\nSons of Faeriell is Dice Tower's Peek of the Week!\nCooperation against Corruption \nDoom is the inevitable outcome of Corruption, and its rise during the game represents a threat to all players. If they don't team up and direct their choices to constrain Corruption, they all risk to lose together against the game. Corruption Events are specific situations in which a player has to decide whether to intervene for the sake of the group, or put their individual goals before everything else.\nControlled randomness \nGame events happen during the production phases, which are resolved at every player\u2019s turn. First, the active player decides which regions or areas will produce, then they have to draw a limited number of tokens from a bag, to determine the status of the Great Guardians in that turn. At every draft, the probability of certain events to happen narrows further and further and players are able to adjust their strategy accordingly.\nAsymmetric characters abilities and development\nWeybits are characters guided by players, represented by highly detailed miniatures. Putting on their Tribe Masks, each Weybit becomes a specific Hero with asymmetric starting abilities, related to the color of each resource. Heroes can level up and acquire new Perks of different kinds, which grant all sorts of additional powers and combo triggers.\nAlternate phase resolution \nEvery phase of the game offers many possible courses of action in a short span of playing time, allowing players to perform tactical moves with high flexibility. This removes the problem of downtime between the players' turns. Moreover, the phases are resolved in the order chosen by each player at every turn, causing difficulties to the opponents in full competitive mode, or following the interests of the group for cooperative purposes.\nCorruption Sower \nPlayers can aim to different winning conditions, thanks to a mechanic designed to prevent runaway leader or stall situations. The Corruption Sower is a new kind of character that enters in play as a consequence of the player\u2019s choices, which flips the competitive side of the game to a run to make all other players lose to the Doom.\nIn the verdant regions of Faeriell, the Great Guardians were living peacefully since the dawn of time, protecting the balance of nature with their majestic presence.\n\nWhen the first Weybit explorers started to appear and decided to settle, it was a joyful surprise. The Great Guardians observed with interest how quickly these tiny and industrious humanoids learned to live in harmony with the environment. An alliance was forged, and it turned out to be a blessing, for the harsh times that were about to come.\n  Lately, the Weybits are getting greedy and competitive like never before, and most of them don\u2019t even know why. In this unsettling scenario, a new menace is rising and some are already whispering its name, calling it Corruption. This luring shadow is causing plants, animals and even the Great Guardians to suffer devastating effects, and patches of darkness are devouring the bright colors of nature all over Faeriell.\n  Weybits are the only inhabitants of Faeriell able to constrain Corruption, though they are also the most likely to fall for its bait. Weybit Tribes are encouraging their most talented Heroes to prove themselves, help the Great Guardians in need and give a hope to the lush land they just started to call home. \nThe Essence of Faeriell is a force that pervades all life, from the smaller grain of sand to the majestic Great Guardians. Each environment is tuned to a different domain of the Essence, and Weybits have learned to retrieve inspiration and resources from the land to express their extraordinary abilities to their fullest.\nThe gigantic and peaceful Great Guardians are as ancient as the land itself. They are an emanation of the essence of Faeriell, one with the nature they protect. \n\nThroughout years of spontaneous friendship and mutual curiosity, Weybits have learned a lot about these incredible creatures, so much that they are the only ones able to help them against Corruption.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our eighth Kickstarter campaign, during these years we\u2019ve gained the expertise and know-how to confidently produce high quality games the way we envision them.\nNonetheless we\u2019ve also learned production, quality control and shipping are delicate phases that can bring unexpected issues that may take some time to solve. For this reason the delivery date, October 2021, is an estimate. While we will do everything in our power to meet this date or even anticipate it, we are aware that slight delays are possible for reasons outside of our control. Also, exact delivery dates could vary depending on where you live.\nIf you have any question, concern or issue write to support@tabula.games and we will be happy to assist you.\nBy pledging for this project you accept the following terms:\nGeneral Terms:\n- This is not a pre-order and the final product may be subject to changes and improvements from what is presented here to ensure smoother production and logistics. This includes every aspect of the game, from miniature design to artworks and layouts.\n- We will only answer to support requests from our backers. If you got the game somewhere else (reseller, friend, group pledge, etc.) you will have to contact us through them.\n- After 30 days from the delivery date to your door, we will not accept complaints related to the game box contents of this campaign (missing components, damaged components, etc.).\n- After 6 months from the shipment date, we will not accept complaints related to the shipment of items of this campaign (damaged package, lost or missing contents, etc.).\n- After 12 months from the shipment date, we will not accept any complaints related to this campaign.\nRefunds:\n- An order can be canceled and fully refunded before the end of the campaign by clicking on the applicable button on Kickstarter.\nAfter the end of the campaign, the order can still be canceled within 14 days by sending us an email with your cancellation request. Please note that in this case the refund will not include the processing costs and Kickstarter fees, which will be deducted from your total. Apart from the cases specified here, the order is considered valid and is not refundable.\nShipping:\n- It\u2019s ultimately your responsibility to respond to our post-campaign survey to claim your rewards and to give us information about your shipping address and add-on choices. If you ignore our Last Call notification for more than 4 weeks we will consider your pledge a donation and we won\u2019t be able to ship you a reward.\n- One week after our Address Lockdown notification we will lock all your address and forward all delivery information to our fulfillment partners and this mean we will be unable to make any kind of change to your address. If you think your address might change during the delivery period we advise you to have the game shipped at another address you trust (friend, relative, workplace, etc.).\n- If the game fails to arrive because of your mistake (wrong address, recipient absent, failure to pick up at courier/postal warehouse, etc.), any additional shipping/warehousing cost for us to re-send/re-deliver your game will be your responsibility. This also includes the costs associated with returning the game. If after investigation it becomes clear that the error was on our part, we will resend your package at our expense.\n- If the package is lost, destroyed or damaged, the carrier will be held solely responsible. Any customer claim to the carrier needs to be made at the time of delivery, not later. If the package seems damaged, please ask the postal carrier to make you a receipt \"accepted with reserve\".\n- Please note that we will not reship any game without first investigating what happened to the first shipment.\n- If your game arrives with missing or damaged components, provide us with proof and we will substitute them once we have verified the damage.\n- We currently have agreements with our fulfillment partners to ensure that no custom taxes will be charged for shipments in USA, EU, CA, AU. However if between the end of our campaign and the start of fulfillment governments decide to impose new tariffs or taxes about imports we might be forced to adjust to the new policies.\n- If you live outside of the USA, EU, CA, AU customs taxes may be added.

The biggest foreseeable risks we currently face are COVID delays, manufacturing in China, and shipping issues from China to our warehouse here in the US.\n\nEach of these risks is greatly minimized with Calliope Games. Our factories have been with us for many years. They know how we work and the quality we expect. In addition, our freight forwarder and fulfillment teams are world class and have over 30 years of expertise to rely upon. If any issues arise, we will know of them far in advance and will be able to overcome them.\n\nNew tariffs may influence costs as well. Typically these are 10%-25% of our total manufacturing cost.

All card counts are approximate and are subject to change. All card and component names are subject to change. All packaging is subject to change and is not finalized. Rules are subject to change.\n\nThere are always risks associated with manufacturing and logistics, especially when working with international partners. Problems can delay or otherwise impact our ability to meet our commitments to our backers.\n\nThese issues include (but are not limited to):\n\n* Production delays\n* Shipping delays\n* Customs delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is June 2021, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Due to the logistics of international shipping in this unpredictable time, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize these risks as much as possible, and we are happy to refund pledges if for some reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nAt your request we can give you a full refund within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that we will subtract Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from Kickstarter after 14 days). Those fees usually equal 8% of the total pledge.\n\nRefunds will be processed through Kickstarter and will be applied to whatever payment method you provided to Kickstarter. In the event that is impossible we will work with you to arrange a refund through other channels.\n\nOnce we have shipped your Reward our refund policy will depend on the circumstances and will be at our discretion.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.

We want the communications channels for this campaign to be a friendly, positive place for our community to gather and discuss the campaign, ask questions, and provide input.\n\nSly Game Design (henceforth referred to as SGD) reserves the right to cancel any pledge (with a full refund) at any time, for any reason. If your pledge is cancelled while the campaign is ongoing you agree not to re-pledge either under your original account or under any other account you control. Violations of this policy will be reported to Kickstarter.\n\nMinor cosmetic damage to the box or other packaging can occur during shipping. SGD makes reasonable efforts to ensure that the shipping containers it uses are suitable for the safe delivery of rewards. If you believe that your reward has suffered more than minor cosmetic damage please contact us immediately. Keep all packaging including outer cartons for our inspection. SGD will at its sole discretion determine if the damage constitutes other than minor cosmetic damage and/or was the result of insufficient packaging.\n\nIf we ship to the address that you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is returned to us as undeliverable you will pay the full cost to ship the Reward again to a revised address.\n\nIf we ship the Reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is delivered to that address but you are unable to receive it, or you have moved and are no longer the occupant of that address and cannot otherwise retrieve the package, or if the package is lost or stolen after delivery, and you wish to have the order fulfilled again you will pay the full cost to ship the order to a revised address plus the amount of the original Reward.\n\nIf we ship the Reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is held in customs or by any other government agency, our ability to help may be limited. You may be required to contact your customs agency or government and arrange for the package to be cleared and released at your expense.

My name is Marsio Salcuni, and I am a lover of Music, Physics and Magnetism, and one day, I got the idea of combining these three things in my own way! ... And I must admit that it didn't go badly ... That idea gave me the opportunity to build my first X-PICK, and start having fun experimenting and playing ... As you can see from the videos, however, I started to understand that it was much more important than just having fun ... Starting to know how to use it, I discovered that it is a set of everything a guitarist or bassist should have always with him ... All enclosed in a little gem! ...\nI apologize for the guitar or Bass performances, but in my defense, I delight more in singing, and this strengthens my desire to see my X-PICK in the hands of REAL GUITARISTS or BASS PLAYERS, to see the thousand other facets that they are able to discover (moreover because each of you has different instruments, amplifiers, settings, etc ... and being Magnetic Fields, they will always be different, with different results, different sounds etc ...)\nEach of you will contribute to the growth of the X-Pick's capabilities, and yours! Because you will have 1000 more ways to MAKE MUSIC!\n\n\nThe X-PICK has a size of 24 mm x 25 mm.\nIt has a thickness of 4 mm and has a well-defined tip, but with a very wide angle, such as to facilitate simple picking or normal fast picking.\nThe DESIGN, combined with the type of MAGNETIZATION, never creates problems of too much attraction towards the strings ... The maximum magnetic degree, is poured only on the faces of the magnet as Physics teaches us, and strong enough, but calculated, on the back of the X-Pick to use magnetic field modulation techniques! ... It is obvious, for example, that the bass strings suffer more attraction, given their thickness, but this in no way prevents the fast and precise picking, as you have seen from the videos because you can take advantage also of a Magnetic Trick, to improve Normal Picking and Fast Picking:\nExactly at the tip, at the union between the North and South magnetic fields, there is no attraction with the iron strings, but an imperceptible, but decisive repulsive force is felt, which facilitates the Picking, as if the string were thrown.\nThe reason is that the iron atoms of the string, being close to both polarities almost simultaneously (i.e. picking) do not have time to reorient themselves for the attraction, and combined with the fact that the power of magnetism always focuses on the faces of a magnet, I opted for axial magnetization that collides the opposite magnetic fields, right in the tip, and I created this kind of magnetism game to facilitate and speed up the movement of the pick ...\nThe rear corners are cut in order to facilitate the use of some particular techniques, and ensure the right degree of magnetism in the interaction between magnetic fields with the Pickups.\nIt has very smooth lateral surfaces to slide on the strings like a slide would and the back is the one that has the most magnetic degree, because it is the widest, suitable for all the innovative techniques that require magnetic field modulations of the pick-ups of the instruments\nThe direction of magnetization of the pick is AXIAL, in such a way as to adapt to any type of polarity of the pick ups on the market:\n\nPOLARITY (with a compass):\nPLAY\n\nMAGNETIC FIELDS (with iron powder):\nPLAY\n\nSo, when you hold the X-Pick in your hand, it will be a normal pick size for you, while the PickUps of the instrument, thanks to the high degree of magnetism N52 of the Neodymium, they will see the equivalent of a magnetic soccer ball moving over them.\nAnd this will give you a lot of leeway in the distance with which to interact on the pick ups, adjust the Gain, the Tones and the Volume of the amplifier, to have a personalized sound so in detail, that you will be truly amazed! ...\n\n\n\nROUND PLASTIC CASE, TO PROTECT THE X-PICK AND ALWAYS CARRY IT WITH YOU !!\nCASE TO SHOW IT IN ALL ITS SPLENDOR AT YOUR HOME, \nWHERE YOU PLAY WITH YOUR BAND, \nOR IN THE SHOWCASE OF YOUR SHOP, \nOR FOR A PHANTASMAGORIC GIFT TO GIVE TO A MUSICIAN !!\n IT IS COMPOSED BY: \n- A WOODEN BOX,\n- VELVET BEARING E\n- NON-SLIP MAGNET,\nWHICH ALLOWS THE X-PICK TO REMAIN ERECTED FOR EXPOSURE, IN FRONT OF THE LOGO THAT IS ALSO PRESENT INSIDE ...\n- AND IN ADDITION WITH THE CHOICE \"EXPO\" YOU WILL ALSO HAVE THE \"TACTICAL\" CASE TO PROTECT THE X-PICK AND TAKE IT WITH YOU ...\nPs. The X-Pick packages may vary a little, but only BETTER than those shown! Because if I find them more beautiful and in recyclable material, if I can have the logo engraved on the box directly, at a decent cost, I want my customers and my planet to be happier and happier!\n\n\nAnd therefore, describing what happens, when I bring the X-Pick closer and away from the pick up of the instrument, there is a field modulation of the electromagnetic coils, with consequent change of shape, direction and intensity of the magnetic field between the X-Pick and the pick ups, to produce a different sound than usual ...\nUsing the X-Pick, you can change - IN REAL TIME - THE POSITION, THE SHAPE, THE POWER, THE INTENSITY, etc ... of the PICK UP, which will have their fixed magnetic field, modulated by a magnetic brother who moves on them!\nAS IF YOU CREATED A DIFFERENT PICK UP FOR EVERY PICK POSITION, ADAPTABLE TO EVERY KIND OF NEED ...\n\n\n\nPLECTRUM:\nNew approach in the use of the Pick, with the use of the Magnetic Trick explained above, to improve control and speed up the Pick;\n\n\nBODY & CRISTALLINITY OF SOUND:\nCrystallinity and Body of Sound thanks to this innovative material, the Neodymium, which makes it seem to ALWAYS PLAY WITH NEW STRINGS!\n\n\nSLIDE:\nA Wonderfull Slide, again thanks to Neodymium, which guarantees a Great Sustain! ... but also under another aspect: Finally you will use the Slide with the right hand in an agile way, leaving the left free to put chords, managing to act even only on the single note !! ...\n\n\nPICK \u2013 TAPPING or \"TAPPICK\":\nThe Pick that will allow you to give a brilliant and perfect note just to contact, without having to press the string on the fret like a Viking, like with normal picks! In fact, it makes the notes shine even where there is no guitar fretboard, so much that you will use it for magnificent and wild tapping, where no one has gone before!\n\n\nBRUSHES EFFECT:\nSound produced only by the magnetic fields, bringing the pick closer to the Pick Up, and making them pass the strings, one by one or all together to create the rolls;\n\n\nMAGNETIC FIELDS DELAY:\nDelay of any kind of sound you want; Just one touch on the note or chords, like the classic pedalboards, and then you have Total Control over the Delay ... You'll be able to slow down or speed up the delay, accentuate it, change the sound in real time ... A simple delay pedal, to do this, IT SHOULD READ IN YOUR MIND!\n\n\nPOWER & ETERNAL SUSTAIN or ELECTRIC VIOLIN:\nOnly sliding on the string gently, with the back or side of the X-Pick; HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU HOPED THAT YOUR BENDING WILL LAST IN ETERNAL GARY MOORE STYLE ???? ... NOW YOU CAN DO IT TOO !!! ALSO RECOMMENDED FOR LESS EXPENSIVE AND PERFORMING GUITARS !!\nOCTAVER:\nJust slipping on the string with the back of the pick, adds more than an octave to the traditional guitar fretboard with a bright and powerful sound!\n\n\nHYPER PICKING:\nTHE TECHNIQUE BORN WITH THE X-PICK, that will allow you to play without touching the strings, and to interact only through magnetic fields! In this case the change in polarity of the magnetic field acts (Attraction/Repulsion), because the movement of the pick is right - left with respect to the string ...\n\n\nMAGNETIC FIELDS TREMOLO:\nOTHER X-PICK TECHNIQUE, which differs from Hyper Picking, because the movement of the Pick with respect to the strings is up and down, that is, close to and away from the string quickly ... In this case there is Compression of Magnetic Fields (Only Repulsion) ... TECHNIQUE THAT FINALLY WILL MAKES TREMOLO POSSIBLE EVEN ON LEVER-LESS GUITARS!\n\n\nREVERSE / ROTARY:\nTechnique that thanks to the magnetic fields, will gives us the possibility of having these effects even without a pedal board ... And then ... How many times have you brought the effects pedals to an evening of the band, to use them in a single song?\n\n\n EPIC ATTACK: \"THE GOD OF ROCK\" \nVersatile and Innovative Pick Attack thanks to Neodymium, and speaking personally, it is one of the most exciting things this little treasure will makes with your support!\n\n\nULTRA MAGNETIC CONVENIENCE:\nYou will be able to magnetically attach your X-Pick wherever you want thanks to the high magnetic degree: to an iron necklace, a bracelet, a belt, a ring, near any small iron part or small part of the same guitar as I did in the video , and speed up your changes from accompaniment to solo! ...\n\n\nMANY EFFECTS TO BE DISCOVERED:\nIn addition to the one shown above, and that you could see from the videos, you must keep in mind that the combinations of use of the X-Pick are infinite ... I am talking about the all different instruments we have, and therefore with different magnetic fields, completely new results , or used together with different pedals, amplifiers of various brands and powers, and I could go on forever as you well know\u2026 SO IT'S A NEW WORLD TO BE COMPLETELY DISCOVERED BY EACH OF YOU !!!\n\n\nATTACH OBJECTS WHERE YOU WANT:\nHang a sheet on the refrigerator, Hang a screwdriver or hammer, Hang up the cell phone, ...\n\n\nLEARN SCIENCE OF MAGNETISM:\nWith a Magnet so strong, it will be easier to learn the rules of magnetism at school, at home, anywhere ...\n\n\nMAGNETIZE OBJECTS:\nSuch as Screwdrivers, screws, Knives, paper clips, etc .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, let's get to the description of the object; this magnetic pick is made with material named Neodymium, from the category of rare earth permanent magnets, is chemically composed with NdFeB (Neodymium-Iron-Boron) and will have a coating that can be of different types ...\nLet's do some clarity ... Why are neodymium magnets so strong?\nNeodymium magnets are often referred to as super magnets. They are, compared to ferrite, much more attractive. Some of them are six hundred times their weight. Energy density is expressed in kilo joules per cubic meter (kJ / m3). To illustrate the difference between ferrite and neodymium magnets, there is a numerical example: ferrite magnets usually have an energy density of around 30 kJ / m3. Neodymium magnets, on the other hand, have a maximum energy density almost 20 times higher, i.e. around 500 kJ / m3. Most of these are not used in the private sector, but are preferred in industry or similar work areas. The reason for their enormous adhesive power is in the chemical compound and crystal structure. This has great anisotropy and extremely high coercive field strengths. This summary table is only demonstrative, but it is very close to the actual one of our Magnetic Pick:\nCOATING OF THE MAGNETS IN GENERAL AND THE ONE CHOSEN FOR THE X-PICK\nThe surfaces must be sealed with a protective layer. For this step, the material must be thoroughly clean and dry. There are many different magnetic coatings for the production of neodymium magnets. The most commonly used coating is a Ni-Cu-Ni coating, that is, a nickel-copper-nickel composition. Other possible coatings are:\nGold plating (Ni-Cu-Ni-Au) Chromium (Ni-Cu-Ni-Cr) Copper (Ni-Cu)Zinc (Zn)\nEpoxy resin (Ni-Cu-Ni- Epoxy)\n... and I chose Epoxy Resin so as to give more grip in contact with the fingers ...\n\u2026 as well as for protection from wear \u2026\n\n\nI tried to make the X-Pick by myself, like the ones you see in the videos\u2026 I made them all by hand with the cutter; but there is a problem ... If magnets reach a critical heat point, they lose a lot of their magnetism, and with the cutter or any other tool, that point is far surpassed! ... And it is for this reason that I am collaborating with a magnet manufacturers, to have my custom patent (pending) made ... It is the only way for the moment, at least until I can afford to open a business independently ...\nUnfortunately, this company need a substantial amount of X-PICK to give me an advantageous quote, for various reasons:\nThe first is the cost of the material, the more it is, the less they pay for it too;\nThe Second is for all instruments and processes for magnetization to grade N52;\nThe third and most expensive is the mold created specifically for this patent (pending); of which they asked me to contribute with the cost of the realization, because the company cannot use it for any other purpose ... \nIn fact, the products that I will ship, will be produced with:\nMAGNETIC CERTIFICATION,\nALL THE SAME AND PERFECT, THANKS TO THE MOLD OF MY PATENT (Pending),\nWITH A COATING AGAINST WEAR, AND TO IMPROVE THE GRIP BETWEEN THE FINGERS,\nWITHOUT THE MINIMAL DEFECT OR IMPERFECTION!\nBut all this has a cost, namely the amount of the loan, structured to fall within the minimum order possible to make this company accept to make the aforementioned mold for my X-PICK.\nI am doing my best to make my little dream come true but I would need some of your help ... \nAnd to thank you, I show you the birth of the X-Pick!\nPLAY\n\n\n\nOn a technical level:\nWhen you'll playing with the X-Pick, you will not hear those annoying hums due to too high gain or too open tones or exaggerated volumes ... This happens because the X-Pick, being made of ferrous material and magnetic, in contact with the strings, IMPROVE THE GROUNDING SYSTEM OF THE INSTRUMENT, closing better the mass that makes the usual turn in your body only from the left hand; a round of Grounding that is usually stopped by the normal picks of non-conducting material ...\nDemostration:\nPLAY\n\nAlso, again in relation to grounding, IT HELPS TO CONTROL AND DISSIPATE THE EDGE CURRENTS that accumulate from time to time on strings, making you even get shocked! And I bet you all know what I'm talking about! ...\n\nAnd then on a philosophical level:\nAnd for this I have to go a little personal ... Well, I'm one of those who sweated with work and the few savings his GIBSON LES PAUL STUDIO, and this desire to have it, created a bond ... let's say I'm one of those who believe that every instrument has a SOUL, a CONSCIENCE, and an OPINION to express\u2026 And when I play, I speak to her! SHE TALK TO ME! ...\nSo why not give maximum voice to this essence? ...\nLET YOUR GUITAR OR BASS EXPRESS, IN NEW WAYS, WITH SOUNDS THAT HAVE NEVER HEARD OR PRODUCED, WITH NEW TECHNIQUES ... NEW VIBRATIONS !! ...\nMY GUITAR WILL ALWAYS BE GRATEFUL FOR THE X-PICK ... IT FEELS ...\n\nAh, I just wanted to show you who I am ... \nPleased to meet you ...", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs I said before, I managed to create my first X-Pick by myself, but with consequent loss of magnetism ... In fact, to work the so-called permanent rare earth magnets with high magnetic potential, you need a lot of machinery, expensive machinery, that only a company already started and that does only this can have.\n\nI do not have the presumption of wanting to open a magnet company immediately, but simply to collaborate with one of these companies, so that they develop a special mold of my patent and provide to magnetization and coating. By proceeding in this way, I will be able to start creating a way forward, because Rome wasn't built in a day! And I tell you as an Italian! That's it! \u2026 \n\nThings start small, and if you've read this far, I'm sure you'll help me take a small step !!

We are anxious to get it to you as early as possible but want to make sure we get it right.\nMeet the team lead behind making the project a success!\nI\u2019ve worn many creative hats over the years. I\u2019ve been a graphic designer, an editor, a vfx artist, a colorist. I fell in love with color grading long before it became accessible to most of us. I might have contributed a tiny bit to their democratization by creating a few plugins for Adobe Premiere Pro that you might actually be using, such as Vignette and Feathered Crop. Some of you might know me from my blog CreativeImpatience.com.\nI\u2019ve also been a software engineer, especially for the past four years, when I was designing and developing backend pipelines, data processing solutions and various APIs. A few of you might have seen one of the first CEP panel extensions to Adobe Premiere Pro that I wrote for That Studio, which allowed you to browse, purchase and manage various media assets. I\u2019ve also collaborated with companies such as Filmstro, Zaxwerks, ChyronHego.\nMaking your workflows simpler and saving you time in post-production is what brings me the most joy and satisfaction. Cinema Grade is a unique product which makes grading accessible to most, and yet goes way beyond just slapping LUTs on your footage. Being able to work on it, first bringing you the up to date Metal version (soon, really soon), and then leading the effort to port it to Windows, has been both an honor and a dream come true.\nWhen I\u2019m not sitting behind the screen, I love traveling, visiting new places and meeting new people.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have an established track record of delivering software products on the Mac side. We do deliver.\n\nThat said, due to the nature of the differing technologies between Mac vs PC, Cinema Grade will require a significant rewrite. At the moment only a small portion of its code is cross-platform compatible. We will certainly keep the heart of what make Cinema Grade so awesome - it's overall architecture and algorithms - but leaving Apple sandbox certainly poses a challenge.\n\nOn the plus side having an actual finished product (Mac version) as opposed to only going off of a prototype will give us a significant advantage and head start. We have already gained insights into how to work with multiple GPU frameworks during our recent work of porting Cinema Grade to Metal.\n\nOur top priority is to ensure the Windows version provides the same or at least a comparable user experience as the Mac version. It is no small feat to achieve. We have recently researched and identified technologies that can be used to reach this goal, but we need time to familiarize ourselves with them and make sure that we use them to their greatest potential, which always takes time.\n\nBecause our development team is small, there is the question of resources. There is always the possibility of personnel changes but if this should happen we are prepared to work night and day until any vacancies are filled.\n\nAdditionally it's impossible to predict the actual demand for Cinema Grade on Windows and the realities of business are that this is the main factor that will drive our development efforts. However, the more demand there is, the more developers we can hire in the long run which means we can pursue a more aggressive roadmap of future features.\n\nLastly we will do our very best to deliver on our projected deadline but as with ALL software development, especially this complex, delivery dates can and do tend to slip (look up Hofstadter's law on Wikipedia). So it's good to be aware of it, hope for the best, but be prepared if the stars do not align, you might need to wait for the final product a bit longer than expected. Our goal is to provide you with tools that work, not tools that crash.\n\nIf you are not adverse to trying out new things and like living on the edge, we provide rewards that will give access to beta, so you will be able to see the software being built, and perhaps have some influence on its final shape, but please do not expect to be able to run it without glitches in a production environment until it's released.\n\nRisk Reversal: In the event the project doesn't succeed (absolute worst case scenario) we are prepared to first offer backers a reward in the form of educational training products from the Color Grading Central website at an equal to or greater value pledged.

Bees with higher radiation exposure are more productive and valuable to the colony. Use your tiles to build honeycombs, increase your bees\u2019 radioactive levels and maximize the number of points you earn to win the crown. \n\n\nPlayers position one of their tiles on the board, keeping within the hive\u2019s pattern. The tiles may be placed in any direction or position.\nWhen players cannot cover any more spaces on the board, the game continues ON TOP of the tiles already in play. There are some simple tile placement rules that everyone must follow.\nWhen all possible moves are exhausted, players mark each of their uncovered bees with a radioactive ring and the round ends.\nPlayers remove all their tiles from the board, keeping the rings acquired on the corresponding tiles, and start a new round.\nPlayers accumulate points during each round when a player\u2019s bees get covered by an opponent\u2019s tile and at the end of the game, by adding up the value of the rings acquired on their bees.\nThe end of the game is triggered when one or more bees have earned enough radioactive rings to receive radioactive markers and emerge as mutant queens. The players then finish the current round and score points. \nWhen the final points are scored, the player with the most points  wins the game.  \n\nFACEBOOK\nINSTAGRAM\nTWITTER\nYOUTUBE\nREDDIT\nBOARDGAMEGEEK\nFACEBOOK GROUP\nWWW.RADIOACTIVEBEES.COM\nWe are confident that our game will do great and are ready for large scale production. That said, and given that this is our first Kickstarter campaign, we developed a conservative budget that allows us to deliver a minimum of 100 game sets.\nWe calculated this budget based on the Full Edition pledge of $48, which totals $4,800 for 100 units. We set our minimum goal at $5,000 to account for the fees to be charged by Kickstarter and the payment processing provider. In addition to manufacturing - and in the context of the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic - this campaign will help fund the salaries of our designers and production staff in Colombia.\nWe have developed prototypes of the game board and individual pieces. In doing so, we have already addressed critical questions about production, how game pieces fit into each other, their final look and feel, etc. Based on our experience developing these prototypes, we are confident in our ability to ramp up production once we have access to the necessary funds.\nWe will handle shipping costs through a pledge manager (Gamefound) and they will be charged to our backers after the campaign ends. Please refer to the image above for shipping costs and reach out to us if you have any specific questions regarding shipping.\nRadioactive Bees is the brainchild of Jose Luis Navas, a Colombian game designer who has 20 years of experience in advertising, manufacturing and game design. Ruben Ocampo is a Chicago-based innovator and entrepreneur, who has 20 years of experience in product development and business strategy. We met during our university years, when we were pursuing our degree in Industrial Design. We are avid gamers, and our passion is to design games that are fun but also require strategic thinking.\nJose Luis is the creator of the 2009 Mensa Select winning game Stratum (a Family Games Inc. brand). Building on the original idea behind this game, Jose Luis was inspired by beehive patterns in the development of Radioactive Bees. In addition to the element of verticality used in Stratum, Radioactive Bees features new elements, such as the radioactive rings, that add complexity and excitement to the game.\nUnder normal circumstances production should be completed in 4 months.

We have every confidence that Crack the Code will be on schedule and of the highest possible quality.\n\nThat said, there are always complexities and considerations in a project of this scope that may cause delays. Indie Boards and Cards will use contract manufacturing to make this game, freight forwarders to get games through customs, and 3rd parties like Amazon, the US Post Office, and FEDEX to ship the games to you \u2013 we don't control everything and there are lots of opportunities for delay. We have a track record of making everything work out for backers in the end \u2013 so please be confident and supportive of our efforts to get this great game into your hands.\n\nEXPECTATIONS\nWe try to represent what will be included in the project rewards to the best of our ability. While we try to manage the expectations accurately, your expectations may vary and may not reflect what the rewards for this project will include. As an example, we may show a golden miniature - that miniature may be golden in color but it would be a false expectation if you thought that you were going to receive a miniature made of gold. If you asked us, \"Is that miniature made of gold?\" - we would tell you that it isn't made of gold and you could decide whether pledging was still worth it to you. So we set the expectations as best as possible, but we can't control your expectations - if there is something that you absolutely can't live without and will regret backing this project because it didn't include that one special thing - ask before the project is over. In the long run, this will help us have aligned expectations and make sure that you are satisfied with your rewards when they arrive.\n\nREFUND POLICY\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus 20% for Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds 14 days after the close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nDAMAGED OR INCOMPLETE PRODUCTS\nWe understand that all backers want to receive their items in pristine condition; however, the realities of worldwide shipping can sometimes make this difficult. We guarantee that the product you receive will be complete and all internal components in perfect condition. We will do our best to ensure that your package arrives in good condition, but all decisions on box replacements will be made on a case by case basis. Due to the difficulty and expense in replacing boxes, depending on your region, we will not be able to replace some boxes with minor cosmetic damage only.\n\nRETURNED PRODUCTS\nIf you refuse to accept your package on arrival we will not issue you a refund for the cost of the pledge.\n\nFAILURE TO RESPOND TO SURVEY\nSurveys will be completed through Crowd Ox. If you fill out the survey after the designated time frame, your package may be delayed in sending to you by up to a few months. If you do not fill out the survey until after the declared end of the project, we may not be able to send it to you.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials, and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and submit your project survey results (ie, provide us with your shipping address) for your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received.

Automatically extended by a spring in 0.3 second when the switch is activated. Completely steer clear of any vent, strip or pad on the bottom to give your device better airflow.\nMUKI BounceMan uses a spring-assisted mechanism that takes just 0.3 second to open and fold in one quick motion. Activate the switch and Whala, the stand automatically extends and stands on its own. Fold it in and it will be locked securely in place. Easy for anyone to use.\nIt transforms any desk, table, or surface into a comfortable, organized work environment within seconds.

Simply attach it to the bottom of your laptop and it\u2019s barely noticeable and almost invisible from the side view\uff01\nIt is a perfect on-the-go stand for frequent travelers, that can be easily carried in your jeans pocket, saving space to the extreme.\nMUKI BounceMan raises the laptop off the table surface, and due to its tiny footprint, it leaves your laptop vents perfectly unblocked for better airflow and improved heat dissipation. So your laptop always stays cool and runs at its top speed.\nMUKI BounceMan is compatible with almost all your mobile devices regardless of their sizes or models. It can be applied to anything flat that you would like to make self-standing or elevated. Smartphone, tablet, Kindle, Switch, keyboard, you name it.\nIt's ideal for a hands-free video watching, game playing, facetiming and web surfing on your smartphone.

In Xenolanguage, you are a group of scientists tasked with deciphering an alien language. As you uncover meaning, you begin to see the world differently.\nA role-playing game to uncover an alien language through a custom channeling board.\nHello from Thorny Games \u2728,the award-winning studio that brought you Dialect: A Game about Language and How it  Dies and Sign: A Game about Being Understood. We live for tabletop games that tell epic stories using innovative mechanics. We\u2019re thrilled to share our latest project with you: Xenolanguage.\nXenolanguage is a tabletop role-playing game about first contact with alien life, messy human relationships and what happens when they mix together.  At its core, you explore your pivotal relationships with others on the mission as you uncover meaning in an alien language. The game gives a nod to soulful sci-fi media like Arrival, Story of Your Life and Contact, but tells its own story. It\u2019s a game for 2-4 players in 3-4 hours.\nIn Xenolangauge, you play as a group of people bound together through a shared past with unsettled questions. Your task is to understand why the aliens have come and what they are trying to tell us. You will soon discover the key to understanding lies in your memories together.\nPlay centers on The Platform: a custom channeling board of mysterious origin. Players all touch a planchette-like lens and channel over alien symbols as they receive and interpret messages.  As the game unfolds, players will progressively discover meanings for the symbols on the board, grapple with what they learn, and see how it changes them. There are no easy answers here; only unsettling possibilities and the choices you make when faced with the true unknown. \nXenolanguage uses a modular channeling board of alien symbols and a custom soundtrack to immerse players in the experience of first contact. Symbols are removable and chosen at the start of each game allowing for surprise and replayabity; every session is unique. Includes art by Jason McPhillips and sound design by A Shell in the Pit (Untitled Goose Game, Wandersong) and Eduardo Ortiz Frau (Gorogoa, The Stanley Parable).\nYour connections with fellow players drive the game. In Xenolanguage, you will explore who you turn to in moments of doubt and in moments of discovery, what lies beneath your shared memories, and how the bonds of a relationship change under the light of first contact.\nIn Xenolanguage, you play to fuse the human and the alien together and see how it changes you. The game focuses on three things:\nA mysterious platform now sits outside a craft that just landed on Earth. You play as scientists tasked with interpreting an alien language that is transmitted through the Platform. At the start of the game, players define their character based on card prompts including archetypes and their role on the mission.\nYou create relationships that connect your character to others in the game. Every relationship has a push and a pull \u2014 the tension that draws you together and apart. That means that all members of the mission have deep personal ties together.\nYour connections drive the game. \n\nYou will play at the Platform, a channeling board covered in alien symbols which you\u2019ll use to communicate with the alien visitors. At the beginning of the game, much is unknown, but as play unfolds you will be led to interpret what they are saying and why they are here.\nTwo players channel with a prototype board and lens\nYou will discover meaning through your memories. Beneath every symbol is a private prompt which awakens a memory between characters. You will play out a flashback together and then use the memory to put meaning to a concept that you don\u2019t have easy words for, but that hints at something both human and alien.\nAll of these memories are rooted in the relationships defined at the start of the game. In this way, your understanding of your past and the semantics of the alien language seep together. Each of these concepts are tied to a particular alien symbol on the board, which you will later use to interpret their message during contact.\nSome examples from past games include \"secrets kept by the people closest to you\", \"the veil between perception and reality\" and \"anxiety of losing joy\".\nWe have been playtesting Xenolanguage far and wide for years. At major gaming conventions from New York, to Indianapolis and Seattle, with friends and strangers, at house cons and online meet-ups. At a beautiful micro-con we co-organized in Olympia, WA. Even once in a Michigan snowstorm. It's been a blast!\nHere's a taste of play in action using our digital module.\nHere are a few publicly-accessible play reports, interviews and other places we've spoken:\nThe Vintage RPG Podcast\nLudology Episode: Words at Play\nBecause Language Podcast: Deep dive into Xenolanguage\nOur interview with the RPG Academy\nPlay Report by Super November Games\nWord Play: Language is a treasure box of game design majesty\nDeveloping 'Artifacts of Play' for your Tabletop Games\n\n\nThe theme of first contact is just electric. It scratches at all the big questions and reveals the strange, ridiculous and profound bits of ourselves, too. We have become obsessed with all the angles you can explore in a first contact story. So much so, we want others in on this, too.\nGames to Bind Us is a play anthology about first contact with alien life, featuring short stories by a tremendous slate of writers including Hugo and Nebula award winners, along with original games by fantastic designers who push the genre forward. The anthology will showcase beautiful original artwork by Dadu Shin and layout/lettering by Brennen Reece. The cover art imagines what playing cat\u2019s cradle, that oldest of human games, might be like with alien visitors. We\u2019re thrilled by the idea of spotlighting short fiction and story games together that pivot off the same theme of \u201cplayful takes on first contact\u201d.\n\n\nIt\u2019s not every project that has such a tremendous slate of contributors. Backing here is your opportunity to get your hands on one of the very first copies of Games to Bind Us - hot off the presses. You'll also get an exclusive first look behind the scenes during development.\n\n\n\nAt Thorny Games, we live for games that tell epic stories through one of our most intimate tools: language. Our previous games have been meticulously crafted and well-received, garnering multiple Game of the Year titles. Xenolanguage is our latest obsession. The First Contact Play Anthology is a beautiful evolution. We\u2019re sharing them both with you now through this Kickstarter.\nThorny Games is the work of Kathryn Hymes and Hakan Seyal\u0131o\u011flu.\nKathryn specializes in teaching robots about human language so we can all be friends some day (in other words, a computational linguist). Sometimes she likes to play her fiddle like a drum. Hakan helps computers keep secrets and crack codes (a genuine cryptographer). He really enjoys breakfast. In the past, they both did a lot of math. In the present, they play games, design games and spread the good word about RPG.\nAlso part of Thorny Games are paradoxical kittens, Banach & Tarski.\n\nJason McPhillips (Art for Xenolangauge). Symbolist painter Jason E. McPhillips creates enigmatic images inspired by the intersection of myth, perception, and scientific theory. His vibe is an incredible fit for the project, and we're so excited to have him on board. See more of Jason's work here.\nDadu Shin (Art for Games to Bind Us). An atmospheric and versatile artist, Dadu\u2019s art draws a beautiful line between the human and the alien in the play anthology. See more of Dadu\u2019s work here.\nBrennen Reece (Layout). Having brought some of the most evocative storygames in recent memory to print - Night Witches, Harlem Unbound, and The Clay That Woke - Brennen\u2019s skills are peerless and we're thrilled to have him on this project. See more of his work here.\nKaren Twelves (Editing). Karen is the author of Improv for Gamers published by Evil Hat Production and if you read any amount of indie tabletop, you've probably read Karen's work far more often than you realize.

In The Little Flower Shop, you create a beautiful display in your flower shop window.  Before describing the promotional packs available in this campaign, I'll tell you a little about the base game. \nThe Little Flower Shop is a simple game to learn, especially if you are already familiar with \"pick and pass\" card drafting games. Despite its ease of play, you must make a surprising number of interesting decisions.  And, by the end, you'll have a pretty flower shop window to admire.\nThe game lasts 3 rounds. Players begin each round with 7 cards, they choose 1 to keep and play, then pass the remaining cards to another player.  From the received 6 cards, they choose another and pass the rest. Play continues in this fashion until all cards have been used and a new round begins. The cards include vases, flowers, hanging baskets, money, and orders. The primary goal is to find flowers and vases that match and to earn money to buy and hang baskets. The player who best maximizes their shop window earns the most flower power  and thereby wins the game.\nIn this campaign, there are 4 different promo packs available: Employee Pack, Potpourri Pack, Mini-Pack, and Flower-Filler Pack. All the promo packs available here are compatible with each other and may be mixed and matched to your liking. \n\n5th Player Pack Add-On\nThe game is for 1-4 players, but you can add $12 for a 5th player pack (if you're in the U.S.).  It contains an additional player board, 3 starting vase cards, and additional cards to add to the deck.  If you are outside the U.S., please contact me directly for it, but the shipping alone would likely be more than $20.  The pack itself is $8 + shipping.\nSend your employee to the warehouse to grab what you need for your window display! The Employee Pack is a brand new expansion  containing 10 \"employee\" cards and 2 rule cards. At the start of the game, remove 10 random shop cards and replace them with the 10 employee cards.  With the 10 removed cards, flip 4 of them to make the \"warehouse.\" At the end of each round, players who kept employee cards during the round can now discard them to take a card from the warehouse (and flip a new one to replace the chosen one).  If multiple players have employee cards, they take turns in order on the cards - so watch out that someone else doesn't take the card you were eyeing!\nThe number 1 employee card\nThe Potpourri Pack adds an interesting twist with the simple addition of 12 potpourri cards.  At the start of the game, each player receives 3 potpourri cards.  Using the same drafting mechanic as the base game, players pick a card and pass, then pick another and pass.  After the second pass, each player has 3 potpourri cards, which provide opportunities to earn money or increase their flower power.\n\nSome potpourri cards give you specific goals to gain a benefit.  For example, one card says: If you hang 3 baskets during the game, score 1 additional flower power.  Other cards give you a special power, such as: Discard 2 cards and draw 2 cards.\nPotpourri cards\nThe Potpourri Pack is essentially an advanced variant to the base game. Since The Little Flower Shop is best categorized as a \"gateway\" game (i.e., a good introduction to strategy board games for non-gamers), this variant pack is a perfect next step to introduce more strategic thinking, without overwhelming new gamers.  Of course, The Little Flower Shop is also a fun diversion for those who prefer heavier games, but want a quick gaming experience requiring some interesting decisions.\nImportant note: the rulebook is provided only in PDF form.\nThe Mini-Pack is a 4-card expansion that includes 4 copies of the same card (i.e., the \"surprise\" card). The surprise cards are shuffled into  the shop card deck and mat be pick as normal. Whenever you take a surprise card, you discard it and draw a random card, which you keep and play in its place.\nmini-pack\n\nNOTE:  Although the Mini-Pack cards are manufactured by the same manufacturer, there may be some slight differences in card texture and colors, since it is a different print run.  For gameplay, this really should not make a huge difference. A discerning eye might be able to see that one of these cards is in a hand, but because all the cards are continually passed, it's does not have any real strategic impact. Also, just remember this is a light and fun game!\nThe Flower-Filler Pack was offered during the original campaign for The Little Flower Shop. The pack has 8 cards: 4 flower bonus cards, 3 filler bonus cards, plus 1 rules card.  At the game's start, a bonus card of each type is flipped showing the popular flower and filler for the game. Players score bonus flower power for displaying the popular flowers and fillers in their windows. \nFlower-filler pack\nNone of the packs have proper packaging.  They are mailed together in a protective plastic sleeve (similar to a baseball card protector), so they are not loose. For the packs, then,  you are receiving just the cards with no packaging.\nThe Little Flower Shop has received very positive reviews from well-established game reviewers, as seen below.\nAll items will be shipped from the U.S.  Packs are mailed through U.S. postal service first class mail, while the Little Flower Shop games will be through Amazon. \n\nFor those outside the U.S. - I apologize that the base game is not available to you;  the shipping charges are just too high.

All information will be collected through the Kickstarter surveys after the campaign and a system for payment for late add-ons may be created through Dr. Finn's Games' website.\n\nPRODUCTION RISKS\nGame manufacturing and publishing contains a number of risks. For this project, the greatest risks follow from the fact that the packs will be manufactured in China and shipped to the U.S. The most serious threats in this regard concern quality control over the manufacturing and delivery delays. Dr. Finn's can mitigate both of these concerns. First, I will be using a manufacturer who has produced great results on projects in the past. Second, I have successfully completed almost all of my Kickstarter campaigns right on time or even early (only 1 project was a few weeks late). If any delays do unexpectedly occur, backers will be notified promptly.\n\nMISSING/DAMAGED ITEMS\nIf you receive any rewards that are missing items, please contact me at doctorfinns@gmail.com and replacements will be promptly shipped.

For the past few projects (after switching manufacturers and shipping companies), we've had a very low defect rate (less than 1%).\n\nREFUNDS\nRefunds are not given, unless there is a failure to deliver the items you've requested. However, if you are completely unsatisfied with any game, please contact me and we can discuss it.\n\nDELIVERY DATE\nUnlike many Kickstarter campaigns, Dr. Finn's Games has a great track record of being on time.

Our touchless technology dispenses a luxurious foam onto your toilet paper, giving you an eco-friendly, natural, and flushable way to clean your tushie. Developed for the healthy, hygiene-conscious, and eco-responsible lifestyle, TUSH\u00c9 increases personal cleanliness and reduce the environmental burden of outdated wet wipes.    \nWe have reinvented the wet wipe into something that is more sustainable and hygienic for you as well as our planet. It is our mission to positively impact the environment while also enhancing people\u2019s lifestyles.\nWhat's wrong with using a wet wipe?\nMost wet wipes are made of Polyester, a form of plastic that sheds fibers as it slowly degrades into smaller particles, polluting our land, rivers, and oceans. \nOther wet wipes are made from \"regenerated cellulose,\" which includes materials like Tencel, Viscos, Rayo, and Lyocell. While these products are marketed as \"eco-friendly,\" the truth is that we still don't fully understand how these processed materials do or don't biodegrade in the natural environment.\nAll wet wipes are made of cloth-like materials, compared to toilet paper they are significantly thicker. Toilet paper will quickly breaks down in your septic system which means it won't be left in landfills or enter our oceans. \nWE CAN DO BETTER! WE ARE CHANGING OUR BOTTLES:\nOur mission is to reduce plastic waste by eliminating single-use plastic wet wipes. Due to the large minimum order quantities, we are financially limited as a small business to pursue more eco-friendly options for our packaging. While our bottles are 100% recyclable plastic, our next step will be developing and transitioning to more innovative, environmentally-friendly alternatives. \nStop flushing your money down the toilet!\nLooking at the graph above, we are wiping out the competition in all categories. There is no other wet wipe on the market that is eco-friendly, natural, flushable, and offers more bang for your buck than TUSH\u00c9.\nEvery starter kit includes a dispenser, cleansing foam, wall attachment, and USB charging cable. After the campaign ends, you'll receive a survey that allows you to add more bottles of our cleansing foam to your order.  \nMORE COLORS, NO PROBLEM!\nWE HAVE REACHED OUR STRETCH GOAL. You will have the option to choose between two colors: pearl white or charcoal grey. In the future, we hope to expand our dispenser variations to meet all of your diverse aesthetic needs.\n\n\nOur TUSH\u00c9 dispensers are designed to be compact and versatile. Dispensers can be placed anywhere in the bathroom of your choosing. Our favorite location? Right next to the toilet paper for easier access. \n\n Our estimate for standard shipping charges is based on the expected volume of our campaign and is subject to change depending on the final result. These charges may also change if you add more products during the survey process such as extra bottles of cleansing foam. We want to keep this process as simple, transparent, and accurate as possible.\nCustoms, Duty, and VAT charges: in some cases, international backers will be required to pay additional fees. As these are beyond our control, it will be the backer's responsibility to cover these fees once they have received the selected reward. Any questions regarding this additional charge should be addressed directly with the backer's customs office.\n\n\nAt TUSH\u00c9, we are a team of dreamers and entrepreneurs focused on making the world a better place. Our mission is to reduce and replace single-use plastic wet wipes. We can sh*t on wet wipes but it doesn't mean that they should be sh*tting on our planet! With your help, we can wipe the world clean! Touch\u00e9 ;)\n\n\nFor the last two years, our team has worked to bring you the perfect TUSH\u00c9.

I have a degree in Design and work full time in Marketing which allows me to cover all bases required to bring projects such as Swatch to life. I previously worked as Social Media Manager for miniature wargaming company Hawk Wargames and as a Partner with East Street Games developing Robot Royale and Mob Sitters, before designing Swatch at the beginning of 2019. I hope to publish other designers' work under the Minerva brand as well as my own, depending on Swatch's success.\nSwatch began as a design challenge I set myself for Uncon 2019 in Kent, which quickly took on the colour mixing theme due to my background. I have since taken it to further Uncon events as well as exhibiting at Tabletop Scotland, Dragonmeet, Handycon and Airecon. Originally called CMYPlay, Swatch has been playtested extensively at Playtest UK events including the regular sessions I run at The Ludoquist in Croydon. I designed a game I wanted to play, a perfectionist's challenge/nightmare (depending on how you see it) that plays in under an hour but with a complexity dependant on how efficient I wanted to be, scratching that eurogame itch.\n\nYou can follow Minerva Tabletop Games by joining my:\n Newsletter \n Facebook Group \n Facebook \n Instagram \n Twitter\n  You can follow Swatch's solo mode designer David Digby here:\n Facebook \n Twitter\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have experience in running Kickstarters as a team but this will be my first run by myself.

Back in the 80s they were brand new and exciting to their tech nerd fans. Now they find themselves in a dusty old box. No one has use for their archaic technology, but they will also never throw them away.\n We can all take a lesson from Mikro and Chip who instead of letting their fate get them down have invented games to play together using their own memory stacks. Rather than worrying about the future they while away their hours playing games and entertaining each other, they\u2019d love to play their favourite game with you - Mini Memory Mischief.\nThis Kickstarter campaign is to fund \"Mini Memory Mischief\" the sweet, retro, quite nerdy little mint tin game. It's 2 player and takes about 10-15 minutes to play. In the game players are trying to get letters in alphabetical order on their memory stack. It\u2019s not as easy as it sounds though! The other player can take their chance causing 'mischief' with your stack.\nThis game is not strictly a 'memory game' - memory is the theme of the game as it is played on Mikro and Chip's internal memory stacks. The game includes dice for luck, player choices using your heart action tokens for strategy, and despite not being a specific memory game does have mechanics that test your own memory (not just the digital kind) and cute little components that fit well in their tiny mint tin home. You can take the game with you as it fits nice and neatly in your pocket.\nYou have a memory stack, an action board and a shield to keep prying (or even peeking) eyes off of your letters. Your goal is to get as many letters in alphabetical order on your memory stack as possible. Push letters you want, pop letters you don\u2019t want. Easy, right? But there\u2019s more, the letters you have are random, some actions are blocked each turn and your opponent can also cause mischief by pushing and popping on your stack. If you take the chance to peek at their letters you can use them as if they were your own, so long as you can remember what you\u2019ve seen.\nWhat\u2019s Mini about Mini Memory Mischief?\nThe game and its components are very little and all fit in this mint tin, which then fits in your pocket. Being so small you might think it would be fiddly but it\u2019s been tested by some of the clumsiest people I know and it still plays well. Here\u2019s a good idea of the scale next to a card from Tri To Win (which are the size of standard poker cards).\nSince the components are super small to fit in their mint tin home this game is not suitable for small children and as I'll be putting the games together at home, they will not be lab tested so the label on the game will say it's for ages 14+.\n\nWhat about the Memory part?\nThere are two sides to the \u2018memory\u2019 of the game. The game itself is played on memory stacks (see nerdy details below for more on this). You will also need to use your own memory for the game; whenever you \u2018peek\u2019 at your opponent\u2019s letters you\u2019re allowed to use their letters as if they were your own, but only if you can remember what you have seen.\n\nWhat\u2019s all this about mischief?\nFor added fun, using the mischief action in the game means you can push unwanted letters onto your opponent\u2019s stack or pop off the last letter they pushed. Be tactical and use this to your advantage.\nFull Instructions\nMini Memory Mischief is super nerdy but you don\u2019t have to be a nerd to love it. However, for those of you who would like to know more detail: Mini Memory Mischief uses a Last In First Out (LIFO) memory stack of 8 bytes, counting from 0-7 (as all counting in computing is started at 0). Each letter or char is one byte stored in each memory location. The \u2018push\u2019, \u2018pop\u2019 and \u2018peek\u2019 actions are all operators that you can use on a memory stack. \u2018Mischief\u2019 however was entirely invented to make the game more fun and to allow for more player interaction.\nIn a standard game of Mini Memory Mischief, the dice and heart action token colours will be a random selection. If you would like to choose which colours the two dice and two action tokens will be there is a reward tier for a custom game of Mini Memory Mischief.\nFor this sweet little plushie die (approx. 8-9cm cubed) you are guaranteed the black and white version but if you message me with your choice of colours, I will try to accommodate it if I already own them to use. This is the only reward tier that is limited, there are 8 available. Here\u2019s some more photos of the black and white one for you.\nDice disclaimer:\nThe plush die in the Mega Atikin Games Bundle is entirely knitted and crocheted by me. There are always imperfections, not all the dots line up perfectly and with the best will in the world it's more round then square. I can't guarantee it goes well with pets either. I watch my cat Captain very closely with it, as I worry that he'll bite off one of the dots. It isn't weighted evenly to be used as a real die either. What it is however is quite cute and fun and that's entirely the point of it. Disembodied hand not included.\nWe\u2019ve been lucky with this project and are actively beta testing Kickstarter\u2019s new \u2018add-on\u2019 feature. Here are the available add-ons for this campaign. Each additional copy of Mini Memory Mischief is discounted by \u00a31.\nDice bags measure approximately 9cm x 8cm when flattened. If you add this item on please get in touch with me and I'll try and match the colours you would like for it, if for any reason we can't get in touch I will send a black one.\nPlease keep in mind that add-ons may increase the cost of postage.\nSmall Fries Games\nTabletop Games Blog \nMovin' Meeples\nBoard's Eye View\nWe're Not Wizards\nMy plan is to have your rewards to you by Christmas. This will depend largely on delivery times towards the end of the year, but I'm hopeful this deadline is doable. It may only be achievable for backers from the UK as international shipping may have extra delays right now.\nUK - Mini Memory Mischief is a UK developed game and I'm delighted to be able to offer Free Shippingwithin the UK.\nRest of the world - I will ship worldwide and shipping will be calculated and charged in the pledge manager after the campaign. Here are the estimated shipping fees:\n*Shipping to USA & Canada will be Economy mail which can take up to 6 weeks.\nIf you add more games (weight) to your order these costs may be greater. It will be worked out by weight in the pledge manager for you.\nPlease note that you may be responsible for duties, handling, fees and taxes applicable to your region, especially if choosing to buy in bulk.\nAs Mini Memory Mischief is so teeny tiny, I can\u2019t fit anything else in its little mint tin. Stretch goals are going to be a little bit of fun and light entertainment.\n\nFor every \u00a3500 raised by this campaign I will release a mildly amusing comic strip of Mikro and Chip for you all to gawp at and roll your eyes at their silly sense of humour.\nSocial stretch goals you say? Let\u2019s do that too, then. For every 500 followers Atikin Games reaches on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter while this campaign is running there will also be comic strips released!\n\nEvery time one of the above goals is reached, I\u2019ll create a poll and you can vote on which comic strip you\u2019d like to see next going only by the fun little titles I\u2019ve given them.\n\nTo whet your appetite this is the first little comic strip. This one appears in the game\u2019s rules.\nAll other Mikro and Chip comic strips will only be released online and you\u2019ll be able to come and see them whenever you like on the Atikin Games website.\n\nYou want to see more of this silliness you say? Any help sharing this campaign link and follows of Atikin Games will all aid in these goals and be incredibly appreciated!\n\nNews! \nDue to a very fun chat that occurred on Twitter mid campaign my husband has agreed to do his own Mikro and Chip fan art for every 100 backers on Mini Memory Mischief. \nMore fun ideas from Twitter! We're working on a pixel Halloween party for Mikro and Chip, for every 20 comments on this campaign we'll plan more of the party. Feel free to use the comment section to suggest what costumes, decorations and guests they should have at the party\nStretch Goals Reached!\n\u00a3500 reached - \"Origin Story\"  \n2000 Instagram Followers - \"Easily Distracted\" \n100 backers fan art - \"Maximum 80s\" \n\u00a31000 reached - \"Mikro's Bad Jokes - Scared of Computers\" \n \u00a31500 reached!\nVoting taking place on the most recent update!\nAtikin Games is an indie tabletop games publisher and very much a one woman show. It's just me, Nikita, hi! All the game design, art, writing, etc for my games is done by me. I'm very proud of my work and love the board gaming community and being a part of it.\n\nI run The Indie Tabletop Newsletter which is full of news from other indie designers and is released once a month. And I regularly host #boardgamerslift's over on Twitter on a Sunday.\n\nThere are some very important additions to my team for whom Atikin Games wouldn't be the same without:\n\nThere's Captain; he's the Atikin Games mascot and even has his own page on the website. He's a wonderful mascot and a great therapy cat for when times are tough. He's also very good at testing the durability of a game.\n\nMy husband is always my first play tester, and then another close family friend helps as well so that I can iron out any possible problems and strengthen the game before play testing with a larger audience.\nSo far I\u2019ve created 3 games, and I love them all. If you\u2019ve read this far you\u2019ve probably heard enough about Mini Memory Mischief for now so here are the others.\nPhotos by Small Fries Games\nTri To Win \u2013 is a triathlon themed card game that I funded on Kickstarter back in February this year. It\u2019s for 2-6 players and tonnes of fun for friends and family. You build up the skills of your athletes whilst building the race course together and then racing on essentially the board game you\u2019ve just built out of cards.\nSmall Fries Games Review\nAmazon Reviews\nBoardgamegeek Reviews\n\nMalum Hortus \u2013 is currently in development and already has a fan base all of its own. It\u2019s a much bigger board game with a horror theme and some wonderful artwork. It\u2019s a 1-4 player co-operative game, you play as nymphs trapped in and trying to escape an evil garden that\u2019s beautiful by day and dreadful at night. I hope to be able to kickstart it next year.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMy previous campaign was delayed by two months due to the coronavirus. Once the games were received by me the campaign was fully fulfilled within 31 hours, so I feel confident in my ability to fulfill on the project. \n\nThis time I won't be using a manufacturer as this is an entirely homemade game.

We just recently released this App!\n\nTake the two-finger challenge!\nBetter Packaging, Epic Sleeves.   Welcome to Season 3!  If you haven't heard of us, check out the amazing reviews, feedback and testimonials HERE.  We have now had over 2,000 backers from more than 30 countries and their feedback speaks for itself.  We have improved packaging and all new sleeve sizes by popular request.

Yes there are tons of card sleeve options out there but we wanted to create something new, a high-quality \"standard\" sleeve that was way better than any other, yet still affordable.  We have been involved to some degree in sleeves for over 8 years and bring a unique know-how to this business.\nWe have been very busy in 2020, we fulfilled the 1000+ backer rewards and have fulfilled more than 3,000 more shipments since then.  We have been actively selling previous seasons' sleeves but are back to step up our game and provide even more sleeves to you! \nThis is the easy part!  This is the best time to get our sleeves, EVER!\n We have the latest bundles for today's most popular games! Looking for a specific game's sleeves?  Check the app above or look at our pre-bundled sleeve page HERE.  You can just fill in the # of games you want to sleeve (mostly 1) and it will tell you how many of each sleeve you need right at the top of the spreadsheet! \nWe have the latest bundles for the hottest games & are adding weekly!\n Thicker Than Any Other \"Standard\" Sleeves  -Most \"Standard\" Sleeves are 40 microns thick, a few are even 50 microns.  Ours are 60 microns thick! That is 20-50% thicker than any other \"Standard\" Sleeve! You have a lot of choices in sleeving, why not choose the best?\n More affordable than other Premium Sleeves! While we aren't the thickest of the sleeves available, we are the only ones offering 110 sleeves per pack at a significantly more premium thickness.  FFG Sleeves (now discontinued!), Mayday Premium Sleeves and others are $2.50 to 3 per pack for just 50 sleeves, while ours are just $2.50 per pack for 110 sleeves, that is less than half the cost per sleeve!\n The \"Clear\" Winner -Our sleeves are made from Cleartech\u2122 Polypropylene.  Our sleeves are made from 60 micron thick sheets which are demonstrably clearer than the other guys.  You can actually SEE the difference.  Just as diamonds are rated on a clarity scale, even 100% polypropylene can vary significantly from product to product depending on how it is manufactured.  You will see the difference!\nThe top sleeve is Sleeve Kings and the bottom is an FFG Sleeve. Notice the difference in clarity? You have to see it to believe it!\n 10% More Sleeves Than The Other Guys -Standard sleeves come 100/pack.  We are the only brand offering 110 per pack!  10% more in every pack!\n Cheaper Than Other Brands  -Most brands retail for $3 per pack or more for only 40 or 50 sleeves.  We are offering ours for $2-3 per pack for 110 sleeves! \n Buy Direct From The Manufacturer & Save!  -How are we able to offer these so cheap?  We ARE Sleeve Kings!  This is our brand!  We produce directly from the factory and sell directly to you.  There is no middleman!\n More Sizes!  It takes years for some brands to slowly add a size to their catalog, we started Season One with 20 sizes, increased that for Season 2, and have a total of 39 sizes for you for a truly HUGE selection!  For a list of games and what size sleeve fits what game, check BoardGameGeek HERE.  Many sleeve companies only offer a handful of sleeve sizes but we are going BIG and offering more for you!\n Cheapest you will ever find them!  If you check out the price per pack at the highest reward levels you will see the savings are huge!\n \"Tough As Nails\" Guarantee We have created these sleeves with the most advanced polypropylene processing in the industry.  This means importing our polypropylene already in the right sizes from the middle east and then cutting and sealing our sleeves at our factory in China before finally sending the rewards onto you.  We have a special process to make our sleeve actually warp/bend before they split in most cases!  Our sleeves simply will not split with regular use!  Just how tough are our sleeves?  We dare you to try the two finger challenge on any other brand of sleeves.  While some of ours may pull apart, the force required to do so is noticeably greater with our sleeves than with any other brand!\nClick on this link to watch Cory compare these to Dragon Shield sleeves!\n1.

No need to add to your pledge now, please wait for the survey!\nAdd this amazing sleeve finder mat for just $5, or it is free with Platinum or Diamond pledges!\nWe are happy to announce we are now doing coin sets, yes many solid metal coin sets will cost you $25-$30 or even more but these sets retail for just $13.95 and can be yours for just $10 with your pledge... yes even Worldwide, though there will be a shipping charge for High Five backers outside of the USA/EU/Australia & Canada).\nAdd on this amazing coin set for just $10 to your sleeve order!\nA closer look at these amazing solid metal coins!\nThis Industrial Coin set is also just $10!\nThese Industrial Style coins are amazing and retail for $13.95... just $10 with your pledge!\nUpgrade to MORE SLEEVES - At the end of the campaign and during the pledge manager we will be offering all $10 and up pledge level backers the chance to up your pledges to a higher level. It will be the LAST chance to get these amazing sleeves at such crazy pricing!\nNote that in prior campaigns we offered Diamond backers the chance to choose to \"split\" their 100 packs into multiple shipments. We have found the logistics of splitting shipments worldwide are just not practical. Only USA backers will be able to split their diamond shipments into two different shipments. So sorry international backers! \nWe will collect the shipping costs AFTER the project is over during the Crowd Ox post-campaign survey process, just pledge for the amount of the sleeves you want!\nWe are trying to offer these sleeves as cheaply as possible. Best of all, the more you pledge for the larger your savings. Shipping worldwide on a hundred or more packs of sleeves will 8 KG or more, so please understand worldwide shipping is EXPENSIVE. For the $10 and $45 pledge levels (\"High Five\" and \"Gold\", respectively), your shipments will likely ship from the USA or from China directly to you, this means that while the rewards will not be \"Customs/VAT\" Friendly that because your pledge is low, the stated value on the package will be below the threshold of Customs/VAT for almost everyone.\nWorried about worldwide VAT/Customs?\nWe are going to be shipping these at a \"replacement value\" for customs, meaning the stated cost on your shipment will be somewhere near the direct, variable manufacturing cost. We will state the value below $1 per item so even at the $10 pledge value with an add on Playmat you will come in well under the $10 minimum stated value that most counties require before any VAT/Customs considerations are triggered. For pledges ABOVE the $45 level (Platinum and above), we are happy to announce that those will be VAT/Customs friendly for the following areas:\nIn other words, if you pledge for a reward at the $80 level or above, your rewards will ship from within your respective region, meaning the USA, Canada, EU or Australia.\nPlease note that we are not experts in VAT/Customs so you will need to review your own country's laws/regulations to best understand what you may actually pay when the rewards arrive.\nNote estimated weight is assuming 100 mini/standard size sleeves. Actual shipping rate charged could vary slightly.\nNote that in season 2 we offered cheaper shipping but COVID hit before we could fulfill and shipping skyrocketed. Shipping is mostly back down to reasonable levels but these rates are estimates of what we will charge when it comes to actually fulfilling your rewards.  Final actual numbers could fluctuate a bit based on actual shipping rates.  We are subsidizing EVERY rate here already though and will charge you LESS than what it costs us to ship in every case.  We are sorry the shipping rates are so expensive, but it is what we actually have to charge due to the extreme weight of these sleeves!!\n USA: Lower 48 states only for Gold/Platinum/Diamond, all USA addresses for High-five.  If you live anywhere other than the non-lower 48 states your shipping cost will be much higher depending on what UPS/DHL charges us.\n Asia 1: Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan.\n Asia 2: Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Taiwan, Vietnam, Cambodia, Philippines.\n Nordic: Sweden, Finland, Norway.\n EU Zone + UK : France, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, UK, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Austria, Switzerland, Denmark, Hungary, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Sweden and all other truly EU countries.  Yes we are including the UK, even though we don't know the details on how this fulfillment will work after Brexit on Dec 20, 2020.  We are planning on establishing our tax status in the UK and importing these into the UK for fulfillment to you UK backers!\n Non-EU: This is all countries that are in Europe but NOT in the EU.  This includes the Norway and Switzerland.\n Note: Any country south of Mexico, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Niger, North Korea, Russia, South Africa, Syria, Somalia, or Yemen. We reserve the right to refund and cancel any pledges from these countries or others where shipping is way too expensive or where delivery is unreliable.  If you pledge for a reward from some other country and the shipping is more than 15% higher than what we are charging for Worldwide we will contact you and give you the option to pay the extra shipping or refund you and cancel your pledge. \nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe have only been around a couple of years and are trying to increase our inventory and grow our customer base, but that is expensive and we have no idea how many of each type of sleeve to make. We need to see what the interest is and how many of each sleeve pack to produce, so we need your help! Without your help we simply won't exist!\nLate Surveys\nWe will launch our survey system around Nov 15 as soon as the backer list from Kickstarter is complete. We will end the survey 3 months after the post-campaign survey opens though so if you want your shipment delayed past February 15, 2021 you'd better contact us and work that out. We don't mind holding your pledge a little longer but don't want people coming back a year after the campaign wondering where the sleeves are, you need to tell us what you want so we can deliver it.\nAny pledges with no survey 90 days after we open the pledge manager (so after February 15, 2021, roughly) will be considered donations. We can't just hold on to hundreds of packs of sleeves for months on end waiting for you to decide what you might want.\n Yes, Kicktraq is amazing!!\nRisks and challenges\nWhile we are a fairly new company, we have a lot of experience in sleeves and board games. We have already delivered on two Kickstarter projects and our factory is ready to pull the trigger and just need funding to get the job done! We fully expect to deliver on time. Note that Season 2 fulfilled quite late due to a variety of reasons, which is why we delayed launching this project until it was fully fulfilled. Our other project Red Outpost is 95%+ fulfilled with the last few backers getting their stuff while this project is running. We are committed to making this our best project yet!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter\nQuestions about this project?

We delivered and are delivering most backers' rewards LATE due to COVID-19 logistical issues, Chinese New Year and a few other problems. The good news is that we have fulfilled or are fulfilling those projects while this campaign is running and all of all Season 2 Sleeve Kings have already been fulfilled. \n\nRed Outpost is also late but it is fully produced and we have already fulfilled to most areas, though Canada is still fulfilling as this campaign is running. We have already delivered 90%+ of the more than 3800 rewards from that campaign. \n\nWe believe in accountability and keep this google sheet with all of our prior campaigns so you our backers can always see exactly where we stand:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y1CLtMqyKT81hTlXyjeC3VFKD9ZPEEYau8Y_g9yfPe4/edit?usp=sharing\n\nWe are keeping this project VERY SIMPLE so it should be fulfilled in plenty of time!

For every RAT card you play, you must also draw a SCANDAL card, which contains a unique punishment.\n A SCANDAL is only revealed when a DIG card is played. The punishment of the SCANDAL may be devastating or just mildly annoying \u2014 the risk is yours to take!\n\nThe voter cards contain unique portraits, showing the rich diversity of characters that is this great nation.\nSelecting the FiliBUSTer, Fat Cat, or Presidential tiers means YOUR portrait will be immortalized in MUD!\nJust a few things to note...\n Your region, political leaning, and income bracket will be RANDOMIZED (no requests!)\n You don\u2019t need to be an American citizen \u2014 all are welcome!\n Be of voting age, and please be human (no pets) \nWe'll be asking you to take a reference photo with specific lighting, framing, and facial expression.\n While everyone who selects one of these three tiers will have their portrait put into the game, we hope that you'll opt to self identify. This is optional, but we ask because representation is important, and we\u2019d love to produce a game that showcases the real diversity of our world. If you feel comfortable, please list your race, gender, age, and sexual orientation.

I introduce my young daughters to card games. At the time, they were five and seven years old, respectively. I explain to my youngest that the Ace card sometimes plays the role of the \u00ab1\u00bb Card. She replies that her mother told her that letters are for writing words and numbers are for counting.\nI try to explain to her that since there is only one pip, this card can be used as the \u00ab1\u00bb Card. Her sister, to facilitate everything, is quick to add that sometimes the Ace card is the strongest of the suit. My youngest daughter\u2019s eyes stare at us as if we are aliens. She seems baffled by our totally crazy logic, and she tells me with all the assurance of a five year old. \u00abDaddy, the \u00ab1\u00bb Cards are missing in your card deck\u00bb.\nWhat can a father do when faced with such a demonstration of consistency? Well yes! I decided that I needed to develop a deck of cards with the cards that the traditional deck lacks.\n\u00abDaddy, the \u00ab1\u00bb cards are missing in your card deck\u00bb. \u00ab Papa, il manque des Cartes \u00ab 1 \u00bb dans ton jeu de cartes \u00bb\nL\u2019ORIGINE\nNous sommes en 1997, j\u2019initie mes jeunes filles au jeu de cartes. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque elles sont respectivement \u00e2g\u00e9es de cinq et sept ans. J\u2019explique \u00e0 ma plus jeune que la Carte As joue parfois le r\u00f4le de la Carte \u00ab1\u00bb, elle me r\u00e9pond que sa m\u00e8re lui a dit que les lettres servaient \u00e0 \u00e9crire des mots et les chiffres servaient \u00e0 compter.\nJ\u2019essaie de lui expliquer que comme il n\u2019y a qu\u2019un seul symbole, cette carte peut servir de Carte \u00ab1\u00bb. Sa s\u0153ur, pour faciliter le tout s\u2019empresse d\u2019ajouter que certaines fois la Carte As est la plus forte du jeu. Les yeux de ma fille cadette nous d\u00e9visagent comme si nous \u00e9tions des extra-terrestres, elle semble d\u00e9concert\u00e9e par notre logique totalement loufoque et elle me d\u00e9clare avec toute l\u2019assurance de ses cinq ans, \u00abpapa, il manque des Cartes \u00ab1\u00bb dans ton jeu de cartes\u00bb.\nQue peut faire un p\u00e8re devant une telle d\u00e9monstration de coh\u00e9rence? Eh bien oui! J\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019il fallait que je d\u00e9veloppe un jeu de cartes avec les cartes qui manquent au jeu traditionnel.\nConcept Summary    /    R\u00e9sum\u00e9 du concept\nA Fifth Suit - The Stars    /    Une Cinqui\u00e8me Famille - Les \u00c9toiles\nThe Star symbol was chosen to represent a fifth Suit, the Stars.\n Le symbole d\u2019\u00c9toile a \u00e9t\u00e9 choisi pour illustrer une cinqui\u00e8me Famille, les \u00c9toiles.\nFive Suits  -  Five Colors    /    Cinq Familles  -  Cinq Couleurs\nWith five distinctive Colors, playing cards become more beautiful, more eye-catching, clearer and more defined.\nAvec cinq Couleurs distinctives, les cartes deviennent plus belles, plus attirantes, plus claires et mieux d\u00e9finies.\nThe Return of the \u00ab1 \u00bb Card / Le retour de la Carte \u00ab1\u00bb\nThe return of the \u00ab 1 \u00bb Card completes the elementary arithmetic sequence and makes it easier for children to understand.\nLe retour de la Carte \u00ab1\u00bb compl\u00e8te la suite arithm\u00e9tique \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire et facilite la compr\u00e9hension par les enfants.\nAces Show Dominance  /  Des As aux allures dominantes\nAce Cards are displayed with large symbols, any ambiguity with Aces is eliminated.\nLes Cartes As s\u2019affichent avec de gros symboles, toute ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 avec les As est \u00e9limin\u00e9.\nWelcome to The Princess Card / Bienvenue \u00e0 la Carte Princesse\nThe arrival of the Princess Card completes the Royal Court and brings panache to the card game.\nL\u2019arriv\u00e9e de la Carte Princesse compl\u00e8te la Famille Royale et apporte du panache au jeu de cartes.\nThe new Princess Card highlights equality between the female and male Face Cards.\nLa pr\u00e9sence de la nouvelle Carte Princesse engendre l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 entre les Cartes Figures f\u00e9minines et masculines.\n5 Different Jokers  /  5 Jokers diff\u00e9rents\nThe forgotten Jokers will now be more involved in the action.\nLeS Jokers, ces grands oubli\u00e9s seront dor\u00e9navant plus impliqu\u00e9s dans l\u2019action.\nThe New Card \u00ab 81 \u00bb / La nouvelle Carte \u00ab81\u00bb\nWith all the mystical coherence that Card \u00ab 81 \u00bb brings, the 5D Deck reaches full maturity.\nAvec toute la coh\u00e9rence mystique qu\u2019apporte la Carte \u00ab 81 \u00bb, le Jeu 5D atteint sa pleine maturit\u00e9.\nAn Unexpected Graphic Challenge \n Un d\u00e9fi graphique insoup\u00e7onn\u00e9 \nThe Approach / L\u2019approche\nThe 5D Deck respects tradition.

These rules will be sent by email.\nGAME 15 :  An evolution type game. This game allows you to quickly become familiar with the new structure of fifteen cards of the 5D Deck. GAME 15 is simple, accessible to all and leads to basic mathematics. It can be played with two or more players.\nTRIO :  Matching Cards game types are very popular. For many of you I strike a chord when I refer to Canasta or Rummy.  These games are some of the most played around the world.  The game TRIO is a simple Matching Cards game, but it can be played new and different ways. TRIO can be played with two or more players.\nTRIX : One of the most popular kinds of games that we found \u00abtrue\u00bb card players are into is the Trick-Taking type of games.  There are hundreds of different Trick-Taking games including Bridge, 500, and Hearts to name a few, which have many followers around the world.  TRIX is a great way to introduce a novice to this type of game.  This is probably the only Trick-Taking game in existence that is played with two players. It can also be played with three players. Do not be too quick to judge, TRIX is not trivial. It is challenging and demonstrates how increasing the number of cards in the 5D Deck is such a huge attribute.\n5D Deck International Version \u00ab 81 \u00bb with 2 Different Colored Backs\nIf you are contributing for one deck of cards, you will have a choice of red or black backing. If you contribute for two decks, you will receive one of each Color.\nThe Economical Approach\nThe approach is to give you the deck of cards with a folded card box and five separate stacks of cards. Everything is inserted into an envelope to considerably reduce delivery costs. You can easily assemble the box and then store your cards in the traditional way.\nIn addition to being economical, this approach will introduce you to the 5D Game, Suit by Suit and probably Card by Card. Even before you have discovered the whole set, you will be seduced, we are convinced.\nA Special Gift\nYou want to contribute to our campaign and help us bring the new 5D Deck to life all over the planet. You are not a fan of playing cards, but you know people around you who are. Offer the 5D Deck in an economical version to a person or persons of your choice. Your shipment will be personalized and mailed out directly as per your wishes.\nYou can choose between two different original presentations.\n\u00b7 The \u00ab THANK YOU \u00bb presentation!\n\u00b7 The \u00ab OLD QUEBEC During the Holidays \u00bb presentation!\nIn both cases, we will be able to identify the sender as well as the recipient of your gift.\nYou will be able to offer the choice of one set with red backing, or two sets with one red and one black. The people to whom you offer the 5D Deck will also receive the rules for the three following games: GAME 15, TRIO and TRIX.  Once the campaign has successfully been completed, we will send you a form to get all the details concerning your gifts.\nThe Complete Set\nIn The Complete Set you will receive two 5D Decks (one of each color) and a booklet of five rules of five new games. This combined with the three games rules sent to all project backers by email, will give you a grand total of eight exclusives new games rules that will allow you to experience the full potential of 5D Games.\nThe Complete Set makes a wonderful gift for any occasion. As with the Economy Set, we will personalize these shipments and mail them directly to your desired location.\nThe Collector Set\nIn the Collector Set, we have added to the Complete Set, a package whose backing is specially laminated with gold colored foil.  This finish will give a lavish look to your game and will be an exclusive item in your collection.\nOnly 500 units will be put into circulation and this product will never be reissued. Each Collector Set is accompanied by a magnificent numbered certificate of authenticity. These are assigned sequentially according to the order dates.\nThe inside of the boxes are also stamped with the \"Special Collector\" seal. Contributors who purchase \u201cCollector Sets\u201d will also receive a personalized postcard handwritten by the designer. (See text below, \"Personalized Token of Appreciation\").\nYou are a Great Collector! Consult the \u201cGreat Collector\u201d section, a surprise awaits you!\nGreat Collector Set\nNot only are you a collector, but you like to stand out and display your contribution to our project with splendor. The \u00ab Uncut Sheet \u00bb which measures 30\u2019\u2019 X 40 \u2018\u2019 is your ideal reward! You can frame it according to your taste and showcase it in your favorite spot.\nOnly 81 copies of the \u00ab Uncut Sheet \u00bb will be withdrawn from the printing batches and these 81 numbered sheets will be affixed with a distinctive seal of authenticity. A card with each back bearing the same seal, as well as a specific header montage drawn by the illustrator of the 5D Deck, our great artist \u00c9lie Miron, will be part of this set.\nWith the addition of these three elements, the \u00abGreat Collector\u00bb will now have a clearly identified and prestigious presentation of our \u00ab Uncut Sheet \u00bb.  This \u00ab Uncut Sheet \u00bb will be delivered in a quality, protective tube.\nMultiple Sets\nBackers who wish to get multiple decks of cards can choose from the different options that are offered. \nHalf-brick: 4 decks of cards    Brick: 8 decks of cards    Double-brick: 16 decks of cards\nHalf-box: 32 decks of cards   Box: 64 decks of cards\n2 boxes: 128 decks of cards   4 boxes: 256 decks of cards\nNote that no matter how many sets are ordered, Multiple Sets will always consist of 50% red back card decks, and 50% black back cards decks. All Multiple Sets are delivered in traditional tuck boxes.\nPersonalized Token of Appreciation\nAll American and Canadian Backers who confirm a pledge on Friday, September 25th will receive a personalized postcard featuring the playing card of the backer\u2019s choice. For backers from other countries, this offer will run until midnight on September 26th.\nConclusion\nThe 5D Deck has been on my mind for several years. The traditional deck of cards has been the subject of much research including the testing of various games. Some exceptional and highly regarded games that I have developed have been played on prototypes for years. I intend, over time, to introduce them to you so that you can appreciate them.\nFor this International Launch, I have added the Card \u00ab 81 \u00bb, a new card that will be particularly important.  I also asked my talented comrade in arms, Elie Miron, to graphically touch up certain cards and I have concocted some new original games that I am sure you will have fun with.\nThe Kickstarter community of backers is a highly active group and involved in the world of playing cards. I appeal to card players, collectors, educators, and parents who will quickly identify all the educational and playful potential and who will agree to help give momentum to the 5D Deck. \nPR\u00c9SENTATION DES R\u00c9COMPENSES ET FORFAITS\nDes cartes \u00e0 jouer pour jouer!\nAvec n'importe laquelle des r\u00e9compenses, les contributeurs recevront les r\u00e8gles de trois nouveaux jeux. Ces r\u00e8gles seront envoy\u00e9es par courrier \u00e9lectronique.\nJEU 15 : Un jeu de type \u00e9volution.  Ce jeu permet de se familiariser rapidement avec la nouvelle structure de quinze cartes de chacune des Familles du Jeu 5D.  JEU 15 est un jeu simple, accessible \u00e0 tous et qui entra\u00eene aux math\u00e9matiques de base.  Il peut \u00eatre jou\u00e9 \u00e0 deux joueurs ou plus.\nTRIO : Les jeux de Combinaison sont tr\u00e8s pris\u00e9s. Si je vous parle de Canasta ou de Rummy, pour plusieurs d\u2019entre vous je touche une corde sensible. Ces jeux sont parmi les plus populaires. Le jeu TRIO est un jeu de montage de s\u00e9rie simple, mais qui fait appel \u00e0 de nouvelles fa\u00e7ons de jouer. TRIO peut \u00eatre jou\u00e9 \u00e0 deux joueurs ou plus.\nTRIX : Parmi les types de jeu les plus appr\u00e9ci\u00e9s chez les \u00abvrais\u00bb joueurs de cartes, on retrouve les jeux de lev\u00e9es. Il existe des centaines de jeux de lev\u00e9es diff\u00e9rents. Le Bridge, le 500, les C\u0153urs pour ne nommer que ceux-ci comptent de nombreux fid\u00e8les dans le monde. Le Jeu TRIX est une excellente fa\u00e7on d\u2019initier un profane aux jeux de lev\u00e9es. C\u2019est probablement le seul jeu de lev\u00e9es qui existe qui se joue \u00e0 deux joueurs.  Il peut aussi \u00eatre jou\u00e9 \u00e0 trois joueurs. Ne jugez pas trop vite, TRIX n\u2019est pas banal. Il repr\u00e9sente un d\u00e9fi int\u00e9ressant et vous fera d\u00e9couvrir comment l\u2019augmentation du nombre de cartes dans le Jeu 5D est un \u00e9norme attribut.\nJeu 5D Version International \u00ab 81 \u00bb offert avec deux couleurs d\u2019endos.\nSi vous contribuez pour un paquet de cartes, vous aurez le choix entre les endos de couleur rouge ou noir. Si vous contribuez pour deux paquets, vous en recevrez un de chaque couleur.\nL\u2019approche \u00e9conomique\nL\u2019approche consiste \u00e0 vous offrir le paquet de cartes avec une bo\u00eete de cartes pli\u00e9e et en cinq piles de cartes distinctes. Le tout est ins\u00e9r\u00e9 dans une enveloppe afin de r\u00e9duire consid\u00e9rablement les frais de livraison. Vous pourrez facilement assembler la bo\u00eete et par la suite ranger vos cartes de fa\u00e7on traditionnelle.\nEn plus d\u2019\u00eatre \u00e9conomique, cette approche vous fera d\u00e9couvrir le Jeu 5D Famille par Famille et probablement carte par carte. Avant m\u00eame d\u2019avoir d\u00e9couvert l\u2019ensemble au complet, vous serez s\u00e9duits, nous en sommes convaincus.\nUn cadeau sp\u00e9cial\nVous d\u00e9sirez contribuer \u00e0 notre campagne et nous aider \u00e0 faire vivre le nouveau Jeu 5D partout sur la plan\u00e8te. Vous n\u2019\u00eates pas un adepte des cartes \u00e0 jouer, mais vous connaissez des gens de votre entourage qui le sont. Offrez le Jeu 5D en version \u00e9conomique \u00e0 la personne ou aux personnes de votre choix. Nous le ferons parvenir directement et votre envoi sera personnalis\u00e9 par nous et post\u00e9 par nous aussi directement chez cette personne si c\u2019est votre d\u00e9sir.\nVous pourrez choisir entre deux pr\u00e9sentations originales diff\u00e9rentes.\n\u00b7 La pr\u00e9sentation MERCI!\n\u00b7 La Pr\u00e9sentation VIEUX QU\u00c9BEC dans le temps des f\u00eates.\nDans les deux cas, nous pourrons identifier \u00e0 qui le cadeau est destin\u00e9 et qui offre le cadeau.\nVous pourrez offrir au choix un jeu avec endos rouge ou deux jeux avec un de couleur rouge et un de couleur noire.

Le jeu de cartes a fait l\u2019objet de nombreuses recherches et de nombreux tests de diff\u00e9rents jeux. Certains jeux exceptionnels et tr\u00e8s appr\u00e9ci\u00e9s que j\u2019ai d\u00e9velopp\u00e9s se jouent sur des prototypes depuis des ann\u00e9es. J\u2019ai l\u2019intention avec le temps, de vous les faire d\u00e9couvrir et de vous les faire appr\u00e9cier.\nPour ce Lancement International, j\u2019ai ajout\u00e9 la Carte \u00ab 81 \u00bb, une nouvelle carte qui aura toute son importance. J\u2019ai aussi demand\u00e9 \u00e0 mon talentueux compagnon d\u2019armes, \u00c9lie Miron, de retoucher graphiquement certaines cartes. Il en a profit\u00e9 pour \u00abdesigner \u00bb de nouveaux endos sp\u00e9cifiques \u00e0 cette \u00e9dition. Je vous ai aussi concoct\u00e9 quelques nouveaux jeux in\u00e9dits qui sauront j\u2019en suis convaincu vous plaire et vous amuser.\nLa communaut\u00e9 de contributeurs de Kickstarter est un groupe d\u00e9j\u00e0 tr\u00e8s actif et impliqu\u00e9 dans le monde de la carte \u00e0 jouer. Je fais appel aux joueurs de cartes, aux collectionneurs, aux \u00e9ducateurs et aux parents qui sauront rapidement d\u00e9celer tout le potentiel \u00e9ducatif et ludique et qui accepteront de contribuer \u00e0 donner cet \u00e9lan au Jeu 5D.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRISKS AND CHALLENGES (Version fran\u00e7aise \u00e0 la fin)\n\nProducing a deck of cards does not represent a great technological challenge, especially since the production is entrusted to Cardston, a printing company specializing in the field of playing cards. The real challenge for us will be to ensure that the multiple shipments are delivered quickly, as we assume that some will be destined for toys & games stores. From then on, our goal is that all private mailing be posted before the end of November 2020.\n\nMost of the private correspondence will be mailed in envelopes. We are confident that everyone will receive their rewards for the holiday season. To avoid any production delays, we have limited the type and number of bonuses for our backers. We do not offer medals, T-shirts, or caps etc.\nFor this first campaign, we are focused on the playing card products including the \u2018Collector\u2019 and \u00ab Press Sheet \u00bb versions. The \u00ab Thank You \u00bb and \u00ab Old Quebec \u00bb mailing cards will be pre-addressed. They will be also manufactured by a specialized supplier that we know well.\nWe will pay special attention to detail, and in a prompt manner, when receiving the information and the choices from our contributors. We therefore intend to quickly establish a frequent relationship with them, and we will regularly sensitize them on the importance of providing us with the required information promptly. We will also constantly update them on the progress so that they can share with us all the fun and enthusiasm of the International 5D Deck launch!\n\nRISQUES ET D\u00c9FIS\n\nProduire un jeu de cartes ne repr\u00e9sente pas un grand d\u00e9fi technologique, d\u2019autant plus que la production est confi\u00e9e \u00e0 la compagnie Cardston qui est un imprimeur sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 dans le domaine de l\u2019impression de cartes \u00e0 jouer. Le d\u00e9fi r\u00e9el pour nous sera de s\u2019assurer que les envois multiples soient livr\u00e9s rapidement, car nous pr\u00e9sumons que certains serviront \u00e0 des magasins de jeux et jouets. Par la suite, notre objectif est que tous les envois priv\u00e9s aient \u00e9t\u00e9 post\u00e9s avant la fin du mois de novembre 2020. \nLa majorit\u00e9 des envois priv\u00e9s s\u2019effectueront par la poste en enveloppes. Nous sommes persuad\u00e9s que tous auront re\u00e7u leurs r\u00e9compenses pour le temps des f\u00eates. C\u2019est d\u2019ailleurs pour \u00e9viter tout retard dans la production que nous avons limit\u00e9 les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de gratifications pour nos contributeurs. Nous n\u2019offrons pas de m\u00e9dailles, T-shirt ou casquettes, etc. \nPour cette premi\u00e8re campagne, nous nous sommes concentr\u00e9s sur le produit cartes \u00e0 jouer y incluant la version \u2018Collectionneur\u2019 et \u00ab Feuille de Presse \u00bb. Pour les Cartes d\u2019envoi \u00abMerci\u00bb et \u00ab Vieux Qu\u00e9bec \u00bb, elles seront pr\u00e9adress\u00e9es et sont aussi fabriqu\u00e9es par un fournisseur sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 que nous connaissons bien. \nNous apporterons une attention toute particuli\u00e8re afin de recevoir rapidement et avec grande pr\u00e9cision les choix et informations de nos contributeurs. Nous avons donc l\u2019intention d\u2019\u00e9tablir rapidement une relation fr\u00e9quente avec ceux-ci et nous allons les sensibiliser r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement \u00e0 l\u2019importance de nous fournir les renseignements rapidement. Nous les informerons aussi constamment de l\u2019\u00e9volution de notre projet afin qu\u2019ils partagent avec nous tout le plaisir et l\u2019enthousiasme du Lancement International du Jeu 5D!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 11 or more", "title": "1 of Spades (5 am Early Bird Special)", "descp": "1 x 5D Deck\n1 x Red or 1 x Black back\nIncludes rules of 3 new games\nGAME 15 -

We were a little cringe-y but the production team did an excellent effort - thank you Sebas and team!\n Why Kickstarter?\n1. Because we completely sold out all 6000 units previously and we need your support in order to do another round of manufacturing!\n2. Because Kickstarter is awesome for small teams like us and we really enjoy engaging and hearing feedback/suggestions from you all through the journey!\nWe are working with the same manufacturing partners as our first campaign. Idealhard and Whatz Games! We had a good experience working with them and got great feedback on component quality. \nIf anybody needs a contact, let us know! We highly recommend them :)\nHere is our estimated timeline. We will be writing regular updates to inform you of our design, manufacturing and shipping milestones!\n\nThe whole of January is dedicated to ensuring that there are no mistakes in the samples from our manufacturing and that the foil cards will look exactly as we want them. Freight deliveries usually take around 2 months from the factory and we've decided to do fulfillment this way because it makes shipping cheaper for everyone.\n*All Backers from our first campaign will get a $8.88 SGD shipping credit in their  Crowdox account. Please remember to use the same email address you used for the first campaign!\nEstimated Shipping Rates\nShipping will be calculated and CHARGED AFTER THE CAMPAIGN (via CrowdOx) according to your destination and total order size. This project will be EU, Canada, China, US and Australia friendly!\nShipping will be expensive in the current climate and nobody is happy about that. We will do our best to ensure high quality fair shipping prices for each backer.We will be working with well-vetted partners in each region who have experience with Kickstarter reward fulfillment.\n\n\nIn these estimated rates, we have tried to subsidize the import taxes and duties as much as we can. We make no money at all from shipping (and probably will take a small loss) so the estimates also include a slight buffer just in case anything happens.\n The final rates which could be slightly higher or lower will be determined in Crowdox after the campaign.\nFirst Kickstarter - Lessons and Loose Ends\nWe've learnt lots from our first Kickstarter. We understand the manufacturing and logistics supply chain better now, as well as what to look out for when working with different partners along the supply chain. From the data and feedback, we believe we've done well and fulfilled over 99% of the pledges for the first Kickstarter successfully and on time as we promised.\nStill, we had some manufacturing decisions and mistakes that were rather costly for us. That is why even though the game play design and component decisions are almost 100% done, we've left more time for ourselves in the KS timeline this time round to ensure that the components produced will be exactly how we want it.\nThere are 2 issues with the previous KS campaign that we now have an opportunity (because of the second KS) to address:\n Sleeves were poker-sized but cards were bridge-sized: Please opt in here at this link. We will send you free poker-sized cards for your game so that they can fit the sleeves you ordered. This only applies to returning backers who ordered extra sleeves.\n Rulebook didn't fit the piano box: The new rulebook will fit in the piano box comfortably, even with the sleeves. Please back the lowest tier and you'll get access to the pledge manager where you can order just the rulebook. You will only be charged for shipping.\nFor Augmented Backers of the first campaign who have not received your personalized cards, either you have not sent in your required images and information or Keith is still working hard on the designs. \nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've delivered successfully on our first Kickstarter, gone to multiple conventions and had a very successful period of online sales before we sold out. In terms of our planning and execution, we have mostly made changes that optimized the project or rectified previous mistakes so we are more prepared for uncertainty and possible challenges. In terms of the foil cards, there is a risk that our foil designs are too idealistic but that is why we have given ourselves an extra month in the timeline for QC and sample approval to ensure that we are satisfied with the end result. \n\nIn the event that the pandemic or an unseen global event causes disruptions to the manufacturing and logistics line, we will communicate our situation and decisions to all backers with consistent, transparent and clear updates.\n\nOur plan is to get the game in your hands by June 2021. No doubt there will be complications along the way \u2014 there always are \u2014 but we feel more well-equipped to handle them than compared to the first campaign. We have great confidence in our manufacturer, freight shippers, and fulfillment centers to get the job done right.\n\nWe intend to do further Kickstarter projects and our credibility and track record are very important to us. We take all feedback and suggestions sincerely. You can contact us anytime at hello@lordofthechords.com.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nOur expected date of fulfillment is June 2021 and we will work as hard as we can to make it happen. However, delays can happen and this is not a definite guarantee.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nAll deliveries will be tracked and you will be sent a shipping number. If the tracking history shows that it was delivered but you did not receive it, it is not our responsibility to reship you one. We will approach these situations on a case-by-case basis and where you might have to pay a minimal amount to cover the reshipment fee.\n\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. All \u201cNo Reward\u201d pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed.\n\nIf you open your game and see that something is missing or broken, we will work hard to get you replacement parts and make things right.

Take part in a new tabletop game Revolution!\n\n\n\n\nJust like a standard deck of cards, the GEMJI System offers multiple games in one set. The big difference is that GEMJI could be used in many more situations and combinations, which means MORE games! The magnetic grid, the double-face tactile interface, the unique design language, and 3D build options make GEMJI unbeatable.\n\n\n\n\nThe dog running around won't destroy your GEMJI battlefield. Nor the wind. Nor the moving boat. GEMJI adds fun to your indoor and outdoor activities and can be played solo or with a group.\n\n\nThe modular nature of the system allows a huge variety of games. With a sprinkle of creativity, you can adapt or reinvent classical games, learn new concepts, master new skills, or play by your own rules and share your games with the GEMJI Community.  Look at the table at the bottom of the campaign for exact titles and parameters for the different games. Here are the main categories: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team got wild with the box design. And honestly, we couldn\u2019t pick just one! That\u2019s why we leave that decision to you - vote for your favorite box cover art now. The most popular choice will determine the final look of our \u201cLight\u201d pledge option. \nHere is how people from SPIEL 2019 reacted to GEMJI.\nPLAY\n\n\n\nGEMJI is also a magnetic constructor to build your dreams. No matter if it\u2019s a 2D or a 3D shape, you got it!\n\nGEMJi can be a fidget to relax because taking care of your inner peace is just as important as growing your creativity.\nFrom a toy to play with, GEMJI easily becomes a tool and an integrative part of every game. Use it as a poker chip, or even build your Dungeons & Dragons map with a twist.\nThe elegant contemporary design makes GEMJI a standing out home decoration. Use it as a book divider, a stylish fridge magnet, or as a coaster to surprise your friends and start playing without getting out a box.\nInstantaneously prototype your design concepts with GEMJI, test various compositions, and share them with friends.\n\n\n\nThe full sets (Original & Light) come with a Rulebook with 21 games and a Build book with 7 model instructions. We've been balancing between good variety and keeping it lightweight shipping-wise. The GEMJI Mini Set comes with 6 games printed on the packaging. They are compatible with any GEMJI set.

They easily snap and attach to the magnetic tiles. The future of GEMJI includes skin sets for different themes, terrains, as well as custom designs for your GEMJI game concepts. These will be introduced in 2021, boosting the existing games, as well as the new ones, created by the community. Hope you like it!\n\n\n\n\nHi! We are the game lovers that created the heart and brains of GEMJI. It was an exciting adventure to bring GEMJI to Life. Now it\u2019s up to you to unlock the universe of possibilities.\n\n\nBonus Videos\n\nFAQ with Mark, the inventor of GEMJI \nPLAY\n\nGEMJI as RPG / D&D modular map explained\nMeet German - he is 33 months old and loves to play with GEMJI", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBefore we even started building this campaign, we spend thousands of collective hours on research, engineering, design, prototyping, product testing, playtesting, and most importantly - we have paid already for the molding instruments and have created a REAL PRODUCT. A short production batch of GEMJI is circulating the world for validation purposes as we speak. \nThat being said, and this being our first Kickstarter project, things can come up with both production and shipping no matter how much we plan. Especially with a new pandemic regime. In terms of shipping - we plan to use both economic & express delivery partners. For example, we have signed already a contract with DHL, so we've minimized the risk significantly. But things can happen that are out of our hands. No matter the circumstances though, we will give our best with the final stage of the delivery, like we've done with the rest of the project for the past 4 years.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nGEMJI is engineered to last for a long time if taken proper care.

Together, we\u2019ve created a brand-new edition of Don\u2019t Get Got with 120 new missions and an aggressively orange colour scheme.\nIf you don\u2019t own Don\u2019t Get Got, that\u2019s perfect. Included in this \u00a320 box is everything you need to play.\nIf you DO own Don\u2019t Get Got, that\u2019s perfect too! Think of this box as a very generous expansion, doubling the amount of missions in the base game and letting you play with up to 20 players. Imagine that! It would be carnage.\nCheck out SU&SD\u2019s glowing review!\nAre you the kind of hotshot who doesn\u2019t have 10 minutes to watch a video? Not a problem, here\u2019s a quick gif-stuffed overview:\nDon\u2019t Get Got is a game of secret missions for 2-10 players, and it takes place while you go about your day. Perfect places to break out Don\u2019t Get Got would be living with housemates, at work, on holiday, at parties, even at gaming conventions.\nEach player receives a cute little wallet full of unique missions, and then you just get back to living your life, except you\u2019re immediately going to start scheming like a mean scheme machine:\nHand out some random missions to each player\nEach mission will tell you what you\u2019ve got to try and trick the other players into doing...\nRead and insert the missions into your wallet\nEach time you succeed at this you get to (a) flip over the little mission in your wallet, which is super satisfying:\nNailed it!\nand (b) reveal your mission to the player who just got got, which is even more satisfying:\nPoint and rejoice\nBut there\u2019s a catch! If you ever get caught (which is as easy as another player asking if you\u2019re trying to trick them), that mission is flipped over to the \u201cFAILED IT\u201d side for the rest of the game.\nFailed it :'(\nThe first player to complete 3 missions wins!\nVictory\nThe writers at Shut Up & Sit Down have had a great time creating new expansions for some of their favourite party games, like Monikers and The Metagame. When Big Potato asked if we wanted to design a brand-new box for Don\u2019t Get Got, we leapt at the chance.\nIncluded in this Shut Up & Sit Down Special Edition are 10 plastic wallets, 1 collectible sticker and 120 missions, all of which were painstakingly entered into a spreadsheet by team SU&SD.\nIn all seriousness, we worked super hard on this, and went through several rounds of refinement and feedback with the original game\u2019s designers. The perfect Don\u2019t Get Got mission makes you smile when you receive it, and represents an interesting, open-ended puzzle as to how exactly you\u2019re going to pull it off. We aimed to deliver that with each and every mission.\n\n\nBut of course not! With enough pledges we will reveal not one, not five, but three stretchy goals that we\u2019d like to offer all of our backers for absolutely free.\nYou took that poor target and smashed it into pieces!\nAs a reward, you\u2019ve unlocked the \u2018EPIC MISSIONS\u2019 pack \u2014 20 Kickstarter-exclusive missions that require so much forethought, even a criminal mastermind would wince at them.\nSurprise extra stretchy goal unlocked! \nWe messed up with the shipping, so here\u2019s something to say sorry \u2014 all the cards from the original Don\u2019t Get Got game. That\u2019s 186 extra missions, carefully placed inside each and every copy of the Kickstarter special edition.\nYou want the rest? Well guess what, you can\u2019t handle the rest!\nOnly joking, of course you can. Introducing the \u2018GAME NIGHT\u2019 pack \u2014 20 Kickstarter-exclusive missions, all designed to be played while you\u2019re playing another board game. How meta are we?\nYou\u2019ve unlocked this year\u2019s hottest fashion accessory!\nFresh from the catwalks of Milan, it\u2019s the SU&SD x Big Potato pin badge. Whether you pin it to your bag, your ear or your fancy lapels, everyone will know you backed the hottest game around (and that you might be up to something sneaky).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIt should be a relief to anyone who\u2019s watched team SU&SD finger board game components into their mouths that they won\u2019t be involved in manufacturing or fulfilment at all.\n\nInstead, publishing and manufacturing will be handled by Big Potato Games, who have published over 50 games and distributed to countries all over the world. They have literally shipped out more games than you\u2019ve had hot dinners.

As an indie sci-fi publisher, this is Arch & Gravity's first entry into the retail board games market, so we're expanding our manufacturing and distributions partnerships. Bringing our experience at international book and art marketing, this is an exciting new venture for us. We're building a brand here, focused on hard sci-fi and quality productions, with the resources of our wholly devoted creatives on tap, but there's no denying that the climb to get this game into every living room is steep. Thankfully, coming from Colorado, we understand that hard climbs bring the best views.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nQuin is an execution of timeless, artistic design, and will look as good on a shelf or table today, as it will on an intergalactic shuttle centuries from now. At every step of the process, we choose materials and methods that last, prioritizing quality and originality. These materials, boards and boxes are superior to others on the market, emphasizing quality for long-term use.\nReusability and recyclability\nThe Quin Deluxe package is entirely honed, using a minimum of materials from the start. With just the 2 Quin Key Instruction Cards, pieces, board and Strategy Guide, Quin uses far less paper and plastic than many new games, without sacrificing variety or replayability. Nearly every part of Quin is recyclable, and everywhere possible we have integrated recycled materials into the production. If we can reach our Earth Edition Stretch Goal, we plan to produce a fully biodegradable version of the game, which if not a first ever, is definitely quite the rarity.\nSustainable materials\nAll of our manufacturer's products meet the standards of CE, ASTM F963/CPSC, Rosh Reach.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nPartnering with Gameland, the papers used do not contain chlorine, and the inks do not contain cadmium. All of the materials used are environmentally friendly, non-toxic.\nSustainable Distribution\nPartnering with Quartermaster Logistics, our shipping will be localized, by professionals who know that cost effectiveness and environmental efficiency are often synonymous. In everything we do, we strive to be sustainable. Our commitment to the planet and future generations is unwavering, a core principle of Arch & Gravity Publishing.\nSomething else\nQuin is a game of science fiction, and aims to teach abstract, creative, strategic thought and honorable gamesmanship.

We knew if we were going to go back to this space, it needed to be something special. It had to wow us and take the IP to places we had not previously dreamt of going. The two games you have before you are just that. All we can say is\u2026 Hold onto your butts!\nWe are all pee-in-our-pants excited over here about finally getting to share something this flipping cool with our most dedicated, creative, and inspiring fanbase. (Dino Island fans are our favorites, y\u2019all. Shhhhh!) And we know you are going to flip over the campaign we have in store\u2026 LET\u2019S DO THIS!\nAfter the campaign ends, there will be a pledge manager. Anyone at the 5 dollar level or higher will have access to upgrade their pledge at this time. This window will be short as the game will enter production as soon as the campaign ends, and final numbers will need to be locked in quickly. Pricing after the campaign ends will be 5 dollars higher for each copy of the game than during the campaign, so your best value is to pledge for a copy of the game while the campaign is live.\n  Timed Exclusives are stretch goals that will be included for no extra charge in all pledges that include the associated game or add-on (i.e. all Dinosaur World timed exclusives will be included in all pledges that include Dinosaur World at no extra cost).\n\nThe Kickstarter Timed Exclusives may be available directly from Pandasaurus Games (Conventions, website, etc) at a later date at limited quantities.  These will not be widely available, but will be available for purchase at key conventions (such at Gen Con and Essen) and potentially our website later but never enter distribution. \nKickstarter Exclusives are stretch goals that will be included for no extra charge in all pledges that include the associated game or add-on (i.e. all Dinosaur World Kickstarter exclusives will be included in all pledges that include Dinosaur World at no extra cost). \n\nKickstarter Exclusives are only available during this campaign and will never be sold at conventions, on our website or directly in the future.  These are true exclusives for Kickstarter backers during this campaign.   We may make them available again in a future Kickstarter campaign, but no plans currently exist for future Dinosaur Island Kickstarter campaigns.\nAfter the campaign ends, we will be charging actual shipping costs. We want to strike a fair balance of value for our backers while ensuring high-quality and fair shipping prices for each backer. By shipping within the EU, UK, Australia, China, Canada, and the United States we are hoping to get as favorable of shipping rates as possible. We will be working with well-vetted partners in each region who have experience with Kickstarter reward fulfillment and come highly recommended by other publishers within the industry and will take into account good (and bad) experiences that other publishers have experienced.\nOur goal is for the average shipping costs for backers in the EU, UK, US, Canada, Australia and China to be under 20 USD, with shipping for backers outside of these regions to come from the most cost-effective area for the lowest possible shipping price.\nBackers in some regions, especially the Middle East, Africa, South and Central America, Russia, and Brazil may experience high shipping fees which reflect the actual cost of shipping to these areas in excess of 50 USD; also be aware that you may be responsible for import duties, taxes, and/or brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or declare that it has a value of zero.  Shipping is also notoriously unreliable in Russia and Brazil especially, while we welcome our fans from these regions, because of high loss and damage rates, Pandasaurus will not reship lost packages to these countries.  Please be aware of this before backing the project.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPandasaurus Games is a nearly 8-year-old board game publisher who has delivered hundreds of thousands of board games worldwide including 9 Kickstarter projects. We are confident in our ability to deliver the rewards listed and on time.\n\nThe artwork for the game is 100% complete and has finished pre-production at the factory. Short of a production issue with some of the bespoke components, delays in shipping or issues with proofing that require reworks, we intend to release the game on time. We will always choose quality production over timeliness, so delay of the game is possible, but we will be ready to hit the printer with final components right at the end of the campaign.\n\nThere is the chance of delay in shipping or customs that is largely out of the control of our company, but we are experienced in moving products through customs. Of course, with multiple freight solutions going to various parts of the world it's possible some regions will get the game more quickly than others. Our goal is to ship the game as soon as it lands on any continent, so we'll have to ask for your patience if some regions get the game before others.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Friend of the Dinoverse", "descp": "At this level you will have our sincere thanks, and access in the pledge manager post-campaign to adjust your pledge.\nINCLUDES:\n- Access to Pledge Manager post-campaign**\n- A hearty handshake from any member of Team Pandasaurus*\n- * If you can find us at a convention.\n- * And there you know, are conventions\n- ** Items in pledge manager will be higher cost than during campaign.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2021"}], "stat": ["725 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "Dino Island Rawr 'n Write Savage Edition", "descp": "Pledge for One Copy of Dinosaur Island: Rawr 'n Write\n*shipping charge is done at the end of the campaign (see shipping section for details)\nINCLUDES:\nDinosaur Island: Rawr 'n Write Board Game\nAll unlocked Dinosaur Island: Rawr 'n Write Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2021"}], "stat": ["484 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 70 or more", "title": "Dinosaur World Savage Edition", "descp": "Pledge for One Copy of Dinosaur World Board Game\n*shipping charge is done at the end of the campaign (see shipping section for details)\nINCLUDES:\nDinosaur World Board Game\nAll Unlocked Dinosaur World Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2021"}], "stat": ["1,242 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 95 or more", "title": "Dinosaur Double Feature Savage Edition", "descp": "Pledge for one copy of Dinosaur World and one copy of Dinosaur Island Rawr 'n Write.\n*shipping charge is done at the end of the campaign (see shipping section for details)\nINCLUDES:\nDinosaur World Board Game\nDinosaur Island: Rawr 'n Write Board Game\nAll Unlocked Dinosaur World Stretch Goals\nAll unlocked Dinosaur Island: Rawr 'n Write Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2021"}], "stat": ["1,739 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 105 or more", "title": "Dinosaur World: All In", "descp": "Pledge for one copy of Dinosaur World Board Game + One Copy of all 3 add-on expansions!\n*shipping charge is done at the end of the campaign (see shipping section for details)\nINCLUDES:\nDinosaur World Board Game\nAll Unlocked Dinosaur World Stretch Goals\nDinosaur World: Hybrid Pack\nDinosaur World: Water Pack\nDinosaur World: Ice Age Pack", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2021"}], "stat": ["1,957 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 125 or more", "title": "Dino Double Feature: The Works", "descp": "Pledge for one copy of Dinosaur World Board Game + One Copy of all 3 add-on expansions + Dinosaur Island Rawr'n Write!\n*shipping charge is done at the end of the campaign (see shipping section for details)\nINCLUDES:\nDinosaur World Board Game\nAll Unlocked Dinosaur World Stretch Goals\nDinosaur Island: Rawr 'n Write Board Game\nAll unlocked Dinosaur Island: Rawr 'n Write Stretch Goals\nDinosaur World: Hybrid Pack\nDinosaur World: Water Pack\nDinosaur World: Ice Age Pack", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2021"}], "stat": ["3,955 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 210 or more", "title": "Retailer Pledge: Dino World Savage Ed.", "descp": "6 copies of Dinosaur World Xtreme Edition\n6 copies of all unlocked Xtreme EditionStretch Goals\nOption for extra copies and add ons (like Rawr 'n Write) at 50% off SRP after campaign end.\nFree shipping possible for minimum orders (email sales@pandasaurusgames.com) for more details\nMust be a retail brick and mortar store, we will confirm retailer status at end of campaign.\nINCLUDES:\n6\u00d7 Dinosaur World Board Game\n6\u00d7 All Unlocked Dinosaur World Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2021"}], "stat": ["205 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #28", "update_userinfo": "Good news sandwich: score boards, backer poll, free promos, & Broken Token update!", "update_content": "Hi everyone!

This perfect family game is packed with choices that will keep your brain running at full steam.\nThe core of the game lies in completing puzzles with pieces. Completed puzzles give you points as well as extra pieces to use. The more pieces you have, the more difficult (and valuable!) puzzles you may try to complete.\nYou start the game with just two little pieces, and on your turn, you can do three actions (you may do the same action repeatedly):\nTake a new puzzle\nGet a new small piece or upgrade a piece that you have\nPlace a piece on your puzzle\nMaster action (only once every round) \u2014 put a piece on all your puzzles!\nOptimize your actions so that your engine grows rather than runs out of steam. Quick development is crucial since once players have taken all the valuable (black) puzzles, the game ends and the player with the most points wins. \nWith the Finesse expansion, you can complete goals on Finesse tiles to earn Credits. You can then spend the Credits to do extra actions.\nThe Ghost Piece expansion adds 24 new puzzles with unique shapes and new reward mechanics. There are also 3 new types of level-5 pieces, the Ghost Pieces. This expansion enhances the replayability of Project L and opens new strategic options for you to explore.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to get the Add-ons? To get the add-ons, click on the Manage your pledge button. Then, click on Change your pledge and increase your pledge amount by the total cost of the add-ons you want. You will be able to select the add-ons you have pledged for in the pledge manager when the campaign ends.\n\nThe Boardcubator Ambassador Program is our way of thanking all the wonderful people in our community who stayed with us throughout the campaigns and whose support and help keep us moving forward. It\u2019s because of your continuous involvement and interest in our games that we amass enough energy and motivation to push our projects further ahead. As a thank you, we\u2019re including a special promo pack in all our Kickstarter campaigns that our ambassadors get for free!\nYou will automatically receive Project L: Finesse Ambassador Pack for free if:\nYou have pledged during the first 72 hours of the campaign,\nYou have supported any of our previous Kickstarter campaigns, or\nYou were subscribed to our newsletter before this Kickstarter campaign launched.\n\n  Looking back to the original campaign in 2018, Project L went a long way. Two years ago, thanks to the support of all the amazing backers, we've fully unlocked all Stretch Goals that allowed us to produce the game in a shape and quality we had never dreamed of. There's not much that could be added or upgraded \u2014 just look at what the backers and reviewers say!\nWhen it comes to the Finesse expansion, we had no other option than to follow the quality of Project L & Ghost Piece (not that we wouldn't like that), so Finesse is already coming to Kickstarter in a super-maximized mode.\nWe prefer to not add anything superficial, untested, or not fitting the content that's been originally planned for the game. And since mostly everything has been already added to the game, the inevitable result is that this campaign is Stretch Goal free.\nOn the other hand, the journey towards making Project L a reality has been so exciting that we just love the idea of sharing it with you in full detail (in even more detail than that the backers of the original campaign remember!). To accomplish that, we\u2019ve prepared a series of behind-the-scenes stories as well as making-of interviews.\nStay tuned for the project updates!\nSince the original campaign from 2018, we\u2019ve partnered with Paul Grogan from Gaming Rules!, a professional rulebook writer & editor, to enhance and streamline the way you can learn to play Project L. Furthermore, focusing on the feedback we\u2019ve received since the first version of the game, we\u2019ve also perfected the rules in terms of game mechanics\u2014mostly concerning the player actions and endgame. \nCheck out the Revised Rules 2.0 (WIP).\nPrinted Revised Rulebook (2.0):\n comes automatically with all pledge levels! So, if you're a backer of the original campaign and are now pledging for the Returning Backer rewards (just the Finesse expansion), you'll receive the physical revised rulebook 2.0 as well.\nincludes the rules of Project L (base game) and all expansions in a single book.\nincludes updated player aids,\nis printed on premium soft-touch paper (that you know from the original campaign).\nis available in English only (see below for more details).\nWe're proud to announce that Asmodee will localize and manufacture Project L (base game) and also distribute it in retail.\nIf you're interested in a localized retail version of the base game, get in touch with your local branch of Asmodee for details about if/when they are releasing Project L in your country and/or language. Since the localization is now in the hands of Asmodee, we're no longer allowed to produce non-English versions of the game.\nPlease note, however, that the retail version by Asmodee and this Kickstarter version by Boardcubator are two separate product lines run by two separate companies. While there's a good chance that the content of one will be compatible with the other, we cannot guarantee that.\nShipping will be charged after the campaign through a pledge manager.\nFriendly Shipping \u2014 We offer friendly shipping to the EU, US, UK, Canada, Australia, China, Hong Kong, Macao, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. Backers from these regions won't spend additional money on customs or other import fees. Based on any given region, we will either ship your reward directly from within the country or will fully cover all potential import fees you might get charged for. \nAdditional Copy Shipping Discount \u2014 If you're interested in getting an additional copy of Project L or one of the expansion, you will spare on shipping for the subsequent copy thanks to reduced rates. Check the table for the discount.\n\nIf you're interested in getting an additional copy of the game, check out the Shipping section for shipping discounts.\nBigger Groups \u2014 If you\u2019d like to pledge for even more copies, get in touch with us at sales@boardcubator.com and we'll get back to you with a special offer.\nJan \"Suki\" Soukal \u2014 Co-founder of Boardcubator who left his day job in IT security a few years ago to become an independent board game creator.

Rulebooks, game boxes, player aids, and puzzle boards have scratch resistant varnish or lamination that ensures that these components will last a long time under frequent use. Based on hundreds of rounds of playtesting, we have gradually improved the technological aspect of puzzle boards into their current 5-layer structure.\n\nThe base game is readily expandable without the need to make any component changes or upgrades to the base game that would require releasing a new version of the game. All expansions of the game can be mixed together.\nReusability and recyclability\nGiven the durability and material quality of the components in the game, Project L will last a long time before it starts showing signs of use or general material deterioration. In the rare case a component gets damaged, we will provide replacement parts.\nSustainable materials\nProject L holds Verification of Conformity according to the EU Toy Safety Directive 2009/48/EC, which declares the game as safe for children and parents to play with and also verifies that there are no physical / mechanical, flammability, or chemical risks.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nPanda GM, the manufacturer of Project L pays extreme attention to worker comfort and safety standards with a fully air-conditioned environment, while being BSCI social compliance certified and following the OHSAS requirements for occupational health and safety.\nSustainable Distribution\nBased on our previous experience with successfully fulfilling Kickstarter projects, we are constantly optimizing the shipping routes to make sure that the distance the game travels is as short as possible. We use several distribution hubs and fulfillment companies to make sure that packages are shipped in bulk where possible before the last mile delivery to our backers.

With 5 new original designs inspired by some of our favorite classic movies, as well one or two extra designs available if we meet our stretch goals. We spent over a year trying to apply the Sock Invaders style to a new, often requested theme. And this is what we came up with. \n   Once again, we're creating affordable designer socks with a pop culture twist for the fashionable geek. Blending traditional patterns, bold colours and movie related designs based on movies by amazing directors like Spielberg and Tarantino.  \nAfter 3 years of designing gamer socks, you guys asked us for new themes. And classic movies seemed like a fun, new challenge. We took over a year and made many designs, before narrowing them down with feedback from our community. \n      The main changes we're making with this project are:\nQuicker production times. \nQuicker delivery time.\nReduced prices, but with country specific shipping fees.\n   For the first time, we're going to start production before the project finishes and use the Kickstarter backer survey instead of an outside survey, to speed things up and hopefully get packages to you before Christmas! Also due to the global virus situation, we've found shipping fees have increased quite a lot. So we've lowered prices but then added shipping fees, based on the costs we experience. \n Our Socks\nOur first ever movie collection!\nBelow are high resolution photos of each of our initial 5 designs. We've named them after the movie they're based on. Each design is available in 2 different sizes.\nReservoir Dogs\nJaws\nThe Blues Brothers\nPulp Fiction\nIT\nStretch Goals\nIf we reach our funding goal, we'll announce futher stretch goals. Starting with our mega movie mashup design. Featuring characters from 6 different movies:\nStar Wars, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, E.T., Jurassic Park, Mary Poppins\nand The Karate Kid.\n\n Size Chart \nOur Socks\nFor 3 years now, our goal has been to make premium quality designer socks affordable for everyone. By cutting out all middlemen and simply producing socks, sending to the fulfilment company and shipping to your door. But what makes our socks so special? Here's just some of our unique features. \n Our Team \n After the success of our last project, we kept our talented, up and coming Italian fashion designer Clarissa. During a difficult year, this project has helped keep us all busy and we really appreciate the support you guys give us during each new project. For me, this is the fourth Sock Invaders project and the first new theme we've tried to make. Please let us know your thoughts, feedback and suggestions for how we can improve.  \n Backer Reviews\nHere are just a few of the lovely comments we've received from our previous projects. \nThanks for checking out our movie socks project and we hope you like our new socks.

They've printed all Thunderworks titles to date.\n\n> Delivery Timeline: Unexpected delays out of my control can always occur (i.e. component shortage, manufacturer issues, customs delays, etc...). For the production schedule of Cartographers Heroes, I've used conservative estimates to account for unknowns and bumps in the road.\n\n> Fulfillment: I have received multiple estimates and will be working with established fulfillment companies that have proven track records for delivering quickly and efficiently all over the world.\n\n> Ninth Project: Even though this is my ninth Kickstarter project, I have continued to spend endless hours researching Kickstarter as well as participating in many Kickstarters. I have done my best to foresee and minimize any obstacles or stumbling blocks.\n\nIn addition, in my life outside of this campaign, I have over a decade of project management experience on large-scale software projects.

Relax while enjoying this elegant game of picking and potting herbs. Pot the best collection of herbs in your different containers, but don\u2019t wait too long or your friend might grab them first.       \nA Tiny Edition for Travel\nHerbaceous Pocket is the same great game in an even smaller package. Herbaceous is a simple to learn, push your luck, set collection game. \n Smooth, streamlined rounds make Herbaceous a fast-moving, engaging game of picking and sharing herbs.\n The Pocket Edition is complete with all cards, dividers, and rules included. Visual adjustments were made to maximize clarity of the smaller size cards.  \nSteve Finn (Dr. Finn's Games) - renowned designer of Biblios and The Butterfly Garden - has created a wonderful compliment to Beth Sobel's stunning herb art. Eduardo Baraf is at the helm of Herbaceous Pocket to ensure it delivers Herbaceous' perfect balance of simple play, interesting moments, and wonderful art in a fantastic, tiny, package.   \n Keith Matejka (Thunderworks Games) - designer of Bullfrogs, Roll Player, and Skulk Hollow - created the additional rules for solo play, loved for its easy, rapid play.  \nHerbaceous is Zee Garcia's #1 relaxing game (and Mike Disilio's #4). The new, great way to experience Herbaceous with a cup of tea.  \n\n\nThe pocket edition of the Flavor Pack Mini-Expansion includes Cinnamon, Star Anise, and Peppercorn and adds a little extra spice to Herbaceous' flavorful play. \nAll Kickstarter backers who pledge for Herbaceous Pocket Edition will also receive the Flavor Pack Mini-Expansion for Free. This expansion will be available for sale typically for $5 separately on BGG, at Conventions, the PFG Store, etc. It will not be packaged within the base game.     \nMy Mother Gives an Overview of How to Play the original Herbaceous - she has the prototype from our first KS.\nRodney Smith from Watch It Played teaches Herbaceous . This is the 1st print edition of the original game.\nRules in Additional Languages: Many of these are fan made, please note the contributor when you download the translation: French, German, Spanish, Italian, Polish \nBoard Game Closet I've never really seen it done like this before...it plays just as good, probably even better...it's just really neat how they did it.   \nTantrum House: It's so cute and tiny!...It's a relaxing game. \nClick for Full Article\nBoardgame Corner: Herbaceous is a perfect after dinner game! \nRahdo Runs Through: Herbaceous is Lovely. It is an absolutely delightful and very fast playing game that you can really do with just about anyone. This is the perfect game for high tea. \nBower's Game Corner: Herbaceous is a rock solid filler game - great family game, great game night game, great gateway game! \nHerbaceous: Pocket Edition is a Stretch Goal free campaign. We set out to make a perfect, pocket, edition of the classic game. Aside from size, card and component quality is in line with the original game.\n\n\n\nPFG worked with various partners to find a cost effective way to ship a single copy of Herbaceous: Pocket Edition internationally. Unfortunately, in a padded envelope, it is just a smidge too thick for international letter shipping. Therefore it is basically the same cost of shipping a small game (and there are a lot of additional shipping fees these days). \nHowever, since it is so small / light, it doesn't cost more to ship 2 or 3 copies in the same box. If you are outside of the US, I highly recommend buying the double or triple pack to split with a friend or give it as a gift. It is an easy, gateway game for almost anyone.\n> Herbaceous Pocket will be EU Friendly,UK Friendly, CA Friendly\nKeep up on Herbaceous\n                            - Follow Herbaceous on Facebook\nKeep up on Us\n                            - Pencil First Games, Follow Ed on Twitter\n                            - Dr. Finn's Games, Follow Steve on Twitter\n                            - BethSobel.com, Follow Beth on Twitter\n                            - Thunderworks Games, Follow Keith on Twitter\nBoard Game Aggregators\n                            - Herbaceous on BoardGameGeek.com\n                            - Herbaceous on BoardGaming.com  \nIntro Video, Header & Lifestyle Photos: More Games Please, Follow Ross on Twitter ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n\"Herbaceous: Pocket Edition\" is Pencil First Games' fourteenth Kickstarter. \"Lift Off!

Given the huge amount of work that Comete has behind it, we decided to restart the campaign but with a novelty. In the midst of bad luck, good news also came: we managed to find a lower price for the production of Comete that we hope, will make all of us happy! We would like to thank  those who supported us in this turbulent and unforeseen beginning, and apologize for the problem, hoping that you will be pleased to know that without you nothing would be possible and that if we develop board games it is to share our ideas with you and let you have fun with new playful experiences.\nYOU CAN FIND US AT THE NEW CAMPAIGN HERE\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's a fragment of our old campaign:\nComete marries cleverness and elegance in a way that few games manage to achieve. The rules are straightforward but about halfway your first game your decisions and those of your rival will make the situation more and more intriguing and exciting, clearing a sky of chances in front of you. Moreover, the cards evoke the mind-blowing and fascinating theme of the sky and unleash the collective imagination linked to the outer space and ancient myths and legends about shooting stars. Easy to learn but hard to master, this game will present a new challenge each and every game. Comete appeal to both hardcore boardgamers, but also to less experienced players: when the two gaming experiences are combined in a single game, every player can take advantage of different strategies and lucky draw-reveal sessions. Other highlights are:\n Highly Replayable: Comete is a very dynamic game that urges you to \u00abthink on your feet.\u00bb We still find ourselves enjoying and improving at the game after hundreds of plays.\n Focused: The unconventional set of Comete is intended to be a complete, deep play experience, with an interesting meta in and of itself. So it's quick to pick up, and there's no need to constantly add more cards to the mix to keep things interesting.\n Simple, quick setup: Just unroll the playmat, shuffle the deck, deal the gems and play. Unlike many deep games, you don\u2019t need to separate or gather cards, set up piles, make decks, etc.\n Player Interaction: Comete is a race (e.g. Dominion, Lost Cities, Tea Time) that has also elements of confrontation (e.g. Azul, Patchwork, Keltis); it can be somehow considered as a balance of racing and interaction. The more interesting the game gets, the more tension between the players grows \u2013 we have seen games ranging from peaceful to highly aggressive, depending on the player\u2019s style. Just keep in mind that your actions can come back to you if you waste your hard-gained resources: aggression will not always be your best playstyle. Many cards can cause you more harm than good if played unwisely.. Timing is everything.\n- Carl Sagan", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nKickstarter works as an all or nothing platform. If we don't reach the goal, nothing will be charged to you.

The estimated delivery date for this project is February 2021, but keep in mind this is only an estimate.

You will pay for shipping & handling in our Pledge Manager. Links to the Pledge Manager will be sent shortly after the Kickstarter campaign ends. The Pledge Manager tool is a 3rd party product that we use to manage orders outside of Kickstarter.\nShipping costs vary widely based on where you will receive your reward.\nAs always, AEG does not make any profit on shipping & handling fees. We charge our best estimate as to what costs we will actually incur for the fulfillment process.\nWe will ship your Rewards at our cost to our international distribution centers.

Shipping & handling for the order will be calculated at checkout. You will see a reduction in shipping per unit but it's impossible to give a single answer on what that will be - it's based on where the order is being shipped, what the total weight & size of the order is, etc. We won't try to figure out a break point where the shipping \"resets\" for a 2nd outer carton (or cartons); we'll just subsidize any marginal cost changes if the order is too big for one outer carton.\nEstimating additional shipping for Add-ons:\nGenerally speaking we are able to put Add-on components into the same master carton as the base Reward in your Pledge which makes them less expensive to ship than they would be if shipped individually. When you build your order in the Pledge Manager the system will generate a shipping & handling cost based on the weight, size, and taxes due for your order. Add-ons typically add a few dollars in shipping & handling cost, add-ons of whole games add about 50% of the base shipping cost.\nRestricted Delivery:\nDue to the increasing frequency of Kickstarter Rewards failing to clear customs or being lost or stolen during delivery AEG now ships only to the following countries:\n\n                                      United States, Canada, United Kingdom, European Union + Norway and Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand, China (including Hong Kong), Japan, Singapore, South Korea & Taiwan.\nAll other backers must arrange to have their reward received in one of those countries and freight-forwarded, at backer expense, to their final delivery address.

Once we have shipped your reward our refund policy will depend on the circumstances and will be at our discretion.\n\nAt your request we can give you a full refund within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that we will subtract Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from Kickstarter after 14 days). Those fees usually equal 10% of the total pledge.\n\nRefunds will be processed through Kickstarter and will be applied to whatever payment method you provided to Kickstarter.

Harassment, name-calling, or attempts to inject inappropriate content into the public communications channels for the project will result in the cancellation of your pledge (with a full refund) and your ejection from the campaign. We want the communications channels for this campaign to be a friendly, positive place for our community to gather and discuss the campaign, ask questions, and provide input.\n\nAEG reserves the right to cancel any pledge (with a full refund) at any time, for any reason.\n\nMinor cosmetic damage to the box or other packaging can occur during shipping. AEG makes reasonable efforts to ensure that the shipping containers it uses are suitable for the safe delivery of your rewards. If you believe that your reward has suffered more than minor cosmetic damage please contact us immediately. Keep all packaging including outer cartons for our inspection. AEG will at its sole discretion determine if the damage constitutes other than minor cosmetic damage and/or was the result of insufficient packaging.\n\nIf we ship to the address that you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is returned to us as undeliverable you will pay the full cost to ship your reward again to a revised address.\n\nIf we ship your reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is delivered to that address but you are unable to receive it, or you have moved and are no longer the occupant of that address and cannot otherwise retrieve the package, or if the package is lost or stolen after delivery, and you wish to have the order fulfilled again, you will pay the full cost to ship the order to a revised address plus the amount of the original reward including any add-ons and other upgrades on your order.\n\nIf we ship the reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is held in customs or by any other government agency, our ability to help may be limited. You may be required to contact your customs agency or government and arrange for the package to be cleared and released at your expense. We are not responsible for refunds or re-shipments for packages held by customs or a government agency.\n\nIn all cases you acknowledge that quantities are limited and AEG may not be able to ship all or part of your order more than once.\n\nOther than as noted elsewhere in these terms & conditions, if any part of your order cannot be fulfilled for any reason AEG will provide you with a pro-rated refund for that portion of your order.\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in to our Pledge Manager and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received.

It's fast and it's easy which makes for there hardly ever being a lineup in public restrooms. But, of course, there is a downside and... it is a messy one. \n Inevitably we all experience a simple law of urination physics:  when we pee, our height + flow speed + porcelain + water =pee splashing-fireworks. \nThis results in residual pee in and around our toilets, pee drips, pee spray, and toilet crud build-up.\nAs part of our mission of designing products that help alleviate the small, yet common stresses we encounter in the day to day, we've designed the Piss Pad. \nThe Piss Pad is a highly dense, diffusing target that attaches to the back of your toilet bowl to diffuse urine splashback. Its robust and functional design is the first in-home urine splashback tool of its kind. \nAt a total thickness of 15mm and a diameter of 40mm, the PissPad is a non-intrusive design that remains in your toilet providing minimalistic splashback protection.\n Installing and removing the PissPad is simple: simply peel, place, and stick. Because we've used microsuction waterproof adhesion, you can rest assured that your PissPad will stay anchored to the porcelain of your toilet.\nWant to remove it? Simply peel it right back off. No residue will be left behind. Easy pee-sy... and you can always reinstall! \n When put to the test, we observed that we needed to clean our toilets 67% less when compared to not using the PissPad! Hello to saving time, money, and toilet paper. Guys... you know what we're talking about: the infamous pee wipe down will be a thing of the past.\n Really, there is nothing like the Piss Pad in the market. From its size, design, and its simple anti-splash functionality, we do really mean that it's the first of its kind for in-home use.\nNo actual urine was used for the making of this campaign. We just thought we should say that...\nBecause of the dense polyurethane fibers incorporated in our design, the PissPad creates thousands of inner channels that restrict liquid from bouncing off the surface and channels urine away without any splash or spray. Aim for the Piss Pad and the work is done.\nFlushing has never felt more satisfying. Once you're done aiming, simply flush as usual and the Piss Pad is rinsed after each and every use. Oh and because Piss Pads fibers are fully sealed, no smells or liquid can cling to its surface. \n Just last year many supporters here on Kickstarter brought PURP (our previous campaign) to life. The feedback after having shipped on time to all of our supporters was phenomenal and we plan to do exactly the same this campaign if not even better.\nWe're New Normal, a little San Francisco-founded company focused on creating products aimed to alleviate the small, yet common, stresses we all encounter day to day.\nWe welcome you to join us on our journey as we create products that aim to do just that, and ideally, lay way to becoming the new normal.\nThank you for taking the time to check out our campaign.

As cautious companions, players must use cooperation, hand management, social deduction and deception to protect themselves, and each other, on a dark and perilous journey.\nOn the shadowy film-noir roads of a mob-ruled mountain town named Mantis Falls, you have witnessed something not meant for your eyes and must now move quickly to escape town alive. You are informed that another witness will join you, and you consider your greatest hope for survival will come if you can contend with the hazards of this night together. But with each damaging event and every fresh wound, your suspicions grow. Looking into your companion's eyes you wonder, perhaps too late, if this person is here to kill you.\nBy use of hidden role cards, Mantis Falls is a \u201csometimes cooperative\" strategy game. A game may have only witnesses, in which case players can win only if they all escape together. Or there could secretly be an assassin, carefully protecting the illusion of collaboration until the right moment to strike.\nUnlike semi-cooperative games with multi-tiered win objectives or accumulations of points, Mantis Falls presents a simplicity of purpose: survival. And this task presents challenge in equal and high measure for all players. When there are only witnesses, players will need to continually perform acts of sacrifice and generosity even as double-edged action cards and \"unseen\" events test the limits of their fragile alliance. Players charged with the role of assassin can survive only with deceit and cunning, always cautious of the powerful but fleeting ability of witnesses to call in a hit on those they no longer trust.\nMantis Falls combines combo-driven card-play and hand-building with player communication. On every turn, players discuss tactics, defend choices and bluff through carefully guarded secrets. Witnesses and assassins alike must walk the line between a willingness to help their companion and a readiness to kill, always reading each other as much as surveying the hazards of the road.\nWith a variable modular board and uncertain objectives, each walk through the roads of Mantis Falls is unique. Moreover, the level of interaction means the relationships and personalities of the players themselves have the power to meaningfully transform every game.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be our first scale-up to mass production and that inherently entails the risk of the unknown. Fortunately, we have the guidance of valuable mentors experienced in this industry, so we are optimistic in our ability to address the challenges that come our way.\n\nOur greatest concern right now is that the game may not reach everyone on our planned schedule.

The jungle ecosystem is full of symbiosis, and players must grow tall trees and lush jungle plants to attract the most diverse wildlife. By carefully selecting what grows in your forest you can create the ideal balance of flora and fauna and give rise to a thriving ecosystem.  \n*Solo and 3-4 player variants unlocked! \nSee below for our full plan to make Canopy as environmentally friendly as possible.\nCanopy is played over three Seasons. Each Season, players endeavor to create a successful rainforest by collecting Plants, Trees, Wildlife and Weather cards.\nGather plants in specific sets to maximize their points. Grow tall and numerous trees to win valuable bonuses. Attract a diverse array of wildlife to help you manage and grow your forest with unique abilities. Beware - as there are threats to the forest as well and the risk of fire, disease and drought is ever-present.\nDesigned by Tim Eisner and beautifully illustrated by Vincent Dutrait, Canopy is designed to play quickly and appeal to a wide range of players. It offers push-your-luck drafting, strategic set collection, meaningful choices and invites players to create their own vibrant rainforest tableau. \n*All components are prototype and may change during final printing.\n(Digital Mock-up. Actual puzzle will be even more beautiful)\nThe Canopy puzzle add-on comes in a separate box and costs $18 plus shipping.  We've just added two new pledge tiers (Retail + Puzzle and Deluxe + Puzzle). If you have already pledged you can switch to one of these tiers or add this to your pledge by clicking on the manage pledge option and increase your pledge by $18.

In recent years we have become increasingly concerned about the effects of climate change on the natural world, and with our own impacts through manufacturing games. When the idea of Canopy came to us, we immediately saw it as an opportunity to work towards making our board games in a more sustainable manner, and working to offset negative impacts. \nWhile we are a small company, we feel it is important to bring our desire for change into our love of making games. We are learning as we go and doing what is feasible for this first project. We see this as the first step of many to making our games in the most sustainable manner possible. \nWe hope that highlighting the unique and wondrous species that live within the rainforest will help connect people to this essential part of our environment. And hopefully, it will spark meaningful conversations and a desire to make sure we all do what we can to protect these wondrously diverse forests.\nSteps we are taking to make the game sustainable include:\nFor each game we sell through Kickstarter we will be planting one tree in partnership with Tree Sisters, a fantastic non-profit based in the UK focused on tropical reforestation and the empowerment of women. \nProducing the game without any plastic. The plastic wrap on cards and the game box will be replaced with paper bands or small stickers. Ziploc bags will be replaced with sturdy paper envelopes.\nAll wood used in the game will come from FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) certified materials. \nAll chipboard components used in the game will come from post-consumer waste. \nKeeping the box size small to limit resources used in freight and domestic shipping.\nThank you for joining us and contributing to our goal of a sustainable future!\n Canopy is played over 3 Seasons. During each Season you will take turns selecting which cards to add to your rainforest from 3 New Growth piles. \nNew Growth: Each turn you will select cards from one New Growth pile. Each time you look at a pile you may select it and add those cards to your rainforest tableau, or return the pile face-down, adding 1 additional card. As the piles grow you must search for the plants and animals that will benefit your forest the most. But choose carefully, as the jungle also contains threats in the form of fire, disease, and drought.\nGrow Your Forest: During each Season you will add cards to your rainforest. Carefully select an ideal balance of Trees, Weather, Wildlife, and Plants to grow a thriving ecosystem. At the end of each Season, you will discard all Plants, Weather, and Threat cards, leaving Trees and Wildlife to continue to grow.\nScore Sets: At the end of each Season you will gain points for your rainforest. Each card type offers a different way to score. Focus on attracting diverse Wildlife, building unique sets of Plants, growing the Tallest Trees, or creating ideal Weather patterns. \nRead the current Canopy Rulebook here.\nCanopy is a fully immersive and vibrant game that we are positive you will enjoy! The gameplay and components are already great, and we are confident it can become even better if you help us spread the word, rally the board gaming community, and exceed our basic funding goal.\nWe have unlocked all of the fantastic Stretch Goals planned to improve component quality and add additional content to Canopy! Thanks for helping us grow a mighty rainforest!\nThe cost of shipping will be charged after the campaign has ended. In the pledge manager, which will go out after the campaign finishes, you will be asked to fill out a backer survey and shipping will be charged at that time.\nBelow are the estimated shipping costs. We have incorporated a portion of the shipping costs into all pledges. (We do not expect prices to vary greatly, but those listed are estimates only and may fluctuate slightly.)\nWant Extra Copies: You may order multiple copies of the game and pay half of the shipping cost for each additional copy. (e.g. If you wanted two copies of the Canopy Deluxe game in Zone 2 you would pledge $58 for the games and estimated shipping would be $13.50.) \nWe have an estimated delivery date of June 2021, and we will be working diligently to get the game to all backers as early as possible.\nWe realize that shipping can be a great barrier  and we have done what we can to reduce that cost. We apologize for any difficulty this creates. We apologize that we DO NOT SHIP to: Afghanistan, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Burma, North Korea, Sudan.\n Eco-Friendly: For each game purchased through Kickstarter, we will plant one tree through our partnership with Tree Sisters.\n Get it First: Backers will receive Canopy before it is available at retail.\n Exclusive Version: Backers of the Deluxe level will receive the exclusive, deluxe version of the game which will not be sold through traditional retail. \n Awesome Stretch Goals: By pledging now you will help us unlock stretch goals to improve both the retail and deluxe versions of the game.\n Your Support is Essential: The game design and artwork are 95% complete and we need your help to make the game a reality.\n This project would not be possible without all of you, our wonderful backers. We seek to honor your vital contribution with our promise that backer copies of Canopy will be shipped out before Canopy is available for purchase from retailers or at conventions. You know what they say: the early Toucan gets the game...or something like that.\nOne of our favorite things about Kickstarter is that it can build and sustain community. We pledge to involve all of our backers in the creation of this project in as many meaningful ways as possible. This may include helping select new wildlife or plants to include in the game, suggesting new components, variants, rules editing, thematic advice, and more. We love your input and will do our best to incorporate as many of your ideas as we can.\nFurther, we pledge to keep you informed at every step along the way as our Kickstarter campaign unfolds.

Two of the third employees in this company are gamers so we have a strange insistence on the products that we design - You can simply regard us as the psychopath, we won\u2019t deny that.\n\n\u201cPower Bay\u201d and \u201cPower Bay Crimson\u201d are our latest products, and we know you are going to compare them with other similar products, however, please allow us to prove that no matter one, two, four or even eight people are using our products, they will never disappoint you.\nWe are terrible at telling amazing stories and not planning to say how hard we work so let\u2019s cut the touching opening and check out the product specification immediately.\nWe provide two products with different specifications for this fundraising project. The main difference is the Bluetooth support function. \u201cPower Bay\u201d supports dual Bluetooth headsets, but \u201cPower Bay Crimson\u201d does not.\nIf you\u2019re interested in \u201cPower Bay Crimson\u201d, please skip to the next page and don\u2019t waste your gaming time.\nThere\u2019s a Bluetooth button on \u201cPower Bay\u201d, press it and then press the \u201cBluetooth Pairing Button\u201d on the headset to connect. It will connect with the second Bluetooth headset automatically after pairing the first one.\nThe human can\u2019t hear the latency lower than 70ms, so you will not notice that the sound is actually slower than the image. If you have any doubts, you can test this SoC in any electronics appliance store. I can guarantee that \u201cPower bay\u201d is superior to other well-known products.\nIn fact, ever since the testing stage, we have highly used this product on \u201cgaming at work\u201d and \u201cworkout in the meeting room\u201d. You can see the attention of our product manager in the following photos.\nBy the way, the people who get caught are our project planner and Brook FAE, the first one is good at boasting (such as the context you\u2019re currently reading), and the other one is good at solving client\u2019s issues with strong muscle (Just kidding. He\u2019s a nice guy and can score 135 points on the chest match at Ring Fit Adventure).  \n\u201cPower Bay\u201d and \u201cPower Bay Crimson\u201d default mode is the \u201cSwitch Pro Input Mode\u201d but you can manually switch it to the \u201cGameCube Input Mode\u201d while using the GameCube Controller.\nMake sure you don\u2019t press any button on the GameCube Controller, press the \u201cTurbo Setting Button\u201d for 5 seconds. You can also switch it back to the \u201cSwitch Pro Input Mode\u201d by pressing the \u201cTurbo Setting Button\u201d for 5 seconds again.\nWere you confused about what \u201cTurbo Setting Button\u201d is? No doubt, both \u201cPower Bay\u201d and \u201cPower Bay Crimson\u201d allow you to set the GameCube Controller to the continuous mode. Alright, I know what you are thinking, just take this as a bonus gift.\nIf you are a Super Smash Bros. true supporter, I think you have got the point, and I don\u2019t need any extra blandishments to convince you to support our project.\nBut\u2026 if you are not, oh that\u2019s too bad. Go find one to explain to you how important the GameCube is. Seriously, this is \u201cSo Important\u201d. Super Smash Bros. has always been a milestone for all gamers, either when you hang out with friends or have fun with family. The GameCube Controller represents the best of every happy time (cheering after winning) and touching moments (weeping after losing).\nNot to mention these two GameCube ports for you to connect with other devices such as Donkey Kong Bongos.\nController, headset, expansion adapter, even Mario wheel, these two ports are enough for you to connect with multiple devices. Ok I know there are some people already thinking about what they are going to connect with their peripherals. For example, when you stay up playing games, I suggest you connect with the wired controller and headset to have perfect gaming experience before being shouted at by your parents. Ah, I admitted that there are plenty of amazing and proper ways of using the product but please allow me to remind you something even more important, which is \u201cStability\u201d.\nWe put extra attention to the input stability and latency issues of the external devices when we first designed \u201cPower Bay\u201d and \u201cPower Bay Crimson\u201d. To be more specific, we don\u2019t want to see that when you are playing, you input something and the instruction is lagging on the image or even nothing happens, causing you to lose an important game.\nDo you think we will exclude these excellent features in the new product? Absolutely not!\nWe conducted a test before launching the product - Randomly choose 10 screens between 20\u201d to 60\u201d and observe the image output from the HDMI port of \u201cPower Bay\u201d and \u201cPower Bay Crimson\u201d, and we can\u2019t find any broken or blurry images.\nAlthough the focus of our discussion has changed from King Koopa to Princess Koopa. Okay, it's not even relevant. The most important part is that we have come up with the idea of \u201cReal-Time Meeting Room\u201d. Sometimes we have to attend other meetings in different companies, and one single laptop is actually hard to satisfy the actual needs and you can\u2019t expect the meeting equipment in other companies to meet your requirements.\nAs a result, we have a portable projector, two Bluetooth speakers, and one phone which supports DP-Alt Mode with \u201cPower Bay\u201d. These small things composed together have become a \u201cPortable Presentation System\u201d.\nWhen we first presented in the other companies with the system, I immediately felt I was at least three levels up than other people and unlocked the secret advanced job \u201cTrendy Marketing Planner\u201d.\nYou can only experience the actual fun part of this product when it\u2019s not connected with power. As everyone knows that the Switch\u2019s hardware has bound with the HDMI output and charging inspection, so if you want to display the Switch image on TV, it\u2019s very difficult to get rid of this limitation. Well, it\u2019s also challenging for us to throw away this burden. On the contrary, we realized that \u201cPower Bay\u201d and \u201cPower Bay Crimson\u201d have more flexibility.\nFirst of all, as long as you don\u2019t output the image with the HDMI port, while you are using Switch, you can normally use the Bluetooth function, also the expansion GC and USB port.\nSecondly, for any devices with USB Type-C port and support DP Alt-Mode (such as MacBook Pro), you don\u2019t need to buy the additional Type-C to HDMI converter, simply using the HDMI output function of \u201cPower Bay\" and \u201cPower Bay Crimson\u201d to display the image on your screen. The \u201cReal-Time Meeting Room\u201d we mentioned earlier is the application of this function.\n--Or maybe you can interpret the case like we are trying to find more selling points to make this product more competitive\u2026\nI\u2019m not sure if you have ever experienced the following situation: Your Switch device suddenly shuts down while you were charging and playing game. You are confused as to what the problem is before realizing your Switch is out of juice. How did this happen when you were charging it the whole time?\nAnswer: The Switch requires max 15V power to operate normally as well as allow playing games and charging to be conducted simultaneously, the voltage required for the entire charging process of Switch is constantly changing, and both \"Power Bay\" and \"Power Bay Crimson\" have the function to adjust the voltage accordingly to protect your lovely console.\nI know you\u2019re probably tired of or simply don\u2019t care about what\u2019s coming next but we want you to know that\n\u201cUs caring, means that you don\u2019t have to.\u201d\nThere are tons of third-party Switch Docks on the market and what makes us different is that we care while others don\u2019t give a damn. We use our own products at home so we certainly don\u2019t want anything bad to happen. For this reason, we adopt only the best in places you wouldn\u2019t normally notice - materials, parts, and processing technology. We want our products to be free from overheating, overvoltage and short circuits after being shipped to our customers. To achieve this, we have a tremendous amount of \u201ctedious\u201d effort. We will spare you the time and energy to understand what we went through, but rest assured, you can relax and be carefree when using \u201cPower Bay\u201d and \u201cPower Bay Crimson\u201d.\nAfter all, us caring, means that you don\u2019t have to.\nJust to clarify again, we to hate see our products damage your Switch, perhaps even more than you do. However, as a responsible company that thinks ahead and prepares for the worst, we have done the following:\nReinforce the USB Type-C flexibility and seal,  preventing short circuits from occurring when your Switch slips. You definitely would not want something like this to happen when you upgrade your firmware or when charging your device.\nReinforce the power control, make sure that \u201cPower Bay\u201d and \u201cPower Bay Crimson\u201d voltage curves match that of original  manufacturer Switch Docks.\nWhat if the above-mentioned situation still occurs?\nSimply put, if you don\u2019t use any non-original manufacturer\u2019s firmware or jailbreak your Switch, and \u201cPower Bay\u201d and \u201cPower Bay Crimson\u201d cause your Switch to malfunction, Brook will take care of the repair. If we can\u2019t fix it, we will compensate you for our loss. \nAs what I said, we are also players, and we're not satisfied with the current dock - whether officially one or others. Therefore, we try to design a new dock ... if no one wants it, at least we can use it ourselves.\nThis video aims to prove that Power Bay is a finished product, it may not be perfect, but at least it's not a garbage which waste you money. \nPLAY\n\n\nYes. To ease your mind, we have asked some gamers to test our products. Some have praised us, while others have criticized our products. We welcome all forms of feedback and let you, the customer, make up your own mind.\nAnd there are more media reported or shared information about \"Power Bay\" with players, maybe you are also interesting about what they say. \n\n*MSRP of Power Bay: $65\n*MSRP of Power Bay Crimson: $55\n *You can check Information about Brook Mas Wired Controller and Brook GameCube to Switch Controller Adapter on Brook Official website.\nBrook, it was born in 2015.

Evidence can be put towards individual success by investigating the three Chapters that make up the game's timeline, or towards a shared pool of Evidence dedicated to foiling the Final Plot itself and preventing the Syndicate from dominating New Dawn City for good. \nEvidence is filed into the Chapter for personal gain, or into the Final Plot to foil the Syndicate's plans as a group!\nEach turn, you'll hook into the mind of a criminal, then you'll gain Grip with every criminal you control. As your Grip increases with criminals, you'll gain access to their unique skills, and develop the stamina to extend your turn and accomplish more. \nA player hooks into the Smuggler, and gains enough Grip to activate its unique Skill!\nNext you'll put your hooked criminals into motion in the zones of New Dawn City. You can move criminals about, transport crucial items, activate the unique zone powers if the coast is clear, trigger powerful criminal skills if you have enough Grip, manipulate the unsuspecting local security forces, and engage in other activities designed to bring you ever closer to the heart of the Syndicate. \nThere are lots of possibilities... the game provides a deep toolkit for achieving your goals!\nYou'll need to put everything in place for the Syndicate's criminals to carry out their nefarious deeds. When everything has been arranged and a crime is committed, you'll earn Intel and Evidence, and unlock more serious crimes in that storyline. Your presence in the minds of the criminals lets you influence their approach... dangerous behaviour will earn you more Intel on the Syndicate's operations, but it also destroys Evidence and earns you more Dilemmas. \nSide Crimes are simpler but less rewarding. Story Crimes get more complex and more rewarding the further into a storyline the group pushes!\nDilemmas are tricky; they come with tempting rewards, but also dangerous Corruption. At the end of each Chapter you'll be forced to choose half of your dilemmas to keep as Permanent Corruption... the ones you keep could be richly rewarding, but the best rewards come with the most corruption! Losing control could drive you over to the Syndicate's side if you're not careful... and it's hard to know for sure if you are the most corrupt agent!  \nYou want big rewards but can you risk the corruption? That's the dilemma!\n At the end of the game, the least-corrupt player earns a bonus. The most-corrupt player has gone in too deep, and will suffer a massive penalty... if the plot was foiled! If enough of the needed Evidence has been filed, the plot is foiled and the In Too Deep player suffers the price of their corrupt ways. If the plot wasn't foiled however, that player reaps the benefits of their troubling tactics with no penalty at all. All players cash in their Dilemmas, and when the dust settles, the player with the most Intel wins the game! \nReady for more?

Lovers of the game can play in a whole new way: digitally! \nMore of a mobile, Steam, or tablet gamer? We have a refreshing new game for you! Try the lightweight worker placement phenomenon that's built a home in hearts across the globe!  \nDuring the game each player will have a limited number of mint tokens, which represent their workers.\nPlayers will use these mint tokens to work locations for effects, like earning more tokens, becoming first player, or buying and building plans.\nPlans are built to give a player victory points, extra abilities, or both.\nOnce a player has at least 7 victory points, play continues until the end of the round, at which point the game ends.\nWhoever has the most victory points wins the game!\nScreenshot of Mint Works Digital\nDigital Features\nPlayers will be able to play Mint Works- in English or Spanish- with their friends or with strangers. Make long road trips more enjoyable with the hot seat option (passing your phone to your friends) or play with your friends in app. Great while social distancing or between game nights! \nPlayers will also have the option to play with strangers instead of their friends. Can't sleep? Waiting for your name to be called at the dentist? Get in a game or two of Mint Works Digital with fellow gamers also looking to add a dash of fun to their day. \nIn addition, players can easily play solo. Try playing against our bot! The bot we created for this program will simulate a live player, and keep gameplay fresh. Want something different in your solo play? If the stretch goals are met, classic A.I. Characters from the tabletop game- Sonic, Rachael, Mort, and Justin- will all be ready to play, whenever you are.  \n $5 Pledge Level: Mint Works Mobile- Pledge $5 and get a digital download of Mint Works for IOS or Android.\n $10 Pledge Level: Mint Works Steam- Pledge $10 and get a Mint Works Steam Key. \n $15 Pledge Level: Mint Works Double Digital- Pledge $15 and get a digital download of Mint Works for IOS or Android, and a Mint Works Steam key. \n $25 Pledge Level: Mint Works Pin & Play- Pledge $25 and get a digital download of Mint Works for IOS or Android, a Mint Works Steam key, and two exclusive enamel pins, the Mint Works logo and one The 'Unboxed Games' logo.   \nShipping \nPledging at the $25 level does not include the shipping cost.

This game delivers all that and more in a nifty little package.\"\n         - MHGreenleaf,  From Board Game Geek\n\"This game is easy to learn but difficult to master, and playing with different groups of people can be refreshing, as there is not a \"one strategy wins\" phenomenon going on. There's a bit of strategy and thinking ahead required but not enough to make playing with a person with AP (analysis paralysis) unbearable, allowing gameplay to go around pretty quickly. The presence of four Advanced Locations also gives the game an element of replayability.\"\n           -Alice Y., From Board Game Geek \n\"The solo AI in this is surprisingly intuitive to navigate, and provides an interesting mix of challenges. Each one of them plays a little differently from the others, and might even bring about alternate losing conditions for the player. I have felt adequately challenged in all but one of my plays so far in this one, and some of them have forced me to adopt strategies and planning that I otherwise wouldn\u2019t consider in a multiplayer game. You have relatively perfect information as the player, since you know where and how they should place, as well as which plan they would prioritize taking from what is offered.\"\n        - David Wiley, From Board Game Geek  \nThe original Mint Works Kickstarter was 1783% Funded! 6,654 backers pledged $89,165 to help bring this project to life in 2017.  \n\n Mint Works is currently in it's third print run, and available in over six languages around the world.  \n\nDice Tower Review Of Mint Works With Tom Vasel. \nRahdo Runthrough, Final Thoughts of Mint Works (with James Hudson)  \n Our Story: Unboxed Games  \nWe are a team of designers dedicated to bringing quality tabletop games to screens everywhere. For our first project, we wanted to usher the tabletop delight, Mint Works into the digital world. With the help of our backers, we will perfect a digital version of Mint Works, allowing you to play with your friends, or on your own, all without the need of a tin, table, or even being in the same room! The game will not only be available on mobile, but Steam as well. No matter how you prefer to game, we have an option for you! \nSelecting the first game to share with screens everywhere was not an easy decision. We wanted something simple enough to play with anyone, but deep enough to scratch the true gamer's itch. Something people could play while waiting 20 minutes or for hours. A title that could be enjoyed not only by friends at the bar, but between a parent and child as well. Mint Works not only checked every one of our boxes, but another we weren't expecting. Justin and Rachael Blaske were more than just good to do business with, they were good people. They care, not only about their product, but everyone who plays it. We found magic in Mint Works, and the Blaske family, and wanted to share some of that magic with others. The design for Mint Works  was licensed to us to use in the digital medium, and we are more than excited to share it with you! \nThe Mint Works Story \nMint Works was created in response to the 2015 Mint Tin Design Contest created by R4D6 on BGG. The list of constraints for the competition were as follows:\nThe game must fit within a mint tin.\nThat was it! Such a simple constraint, but it gave Justin Blaske the push he needed to come up with a fun idea. Because a mint tin is so easily portable, and designed to be rugged enough to fit in a pocket, he considered making a game that would be good on the go.\nJustin thought, 'what would be a good game to carry around in your pocket that isn't typical for that form factor?  Worker Placement would be neat!' So he ran with it. The rules turned out to be fairly simple, Justin then realized he had a portable gateway worker placement game. Mint Works became something you can carry with you on a day to day basis, and use to introduce new people to the hobby of strategic gaming.  \nJustin Blaske, Rachel Blaske, and Family\n\nWe are so excited to bring one of our favorite games to you on a digital platform. We'd like to once again thank Five24 Labs, and all of our backers who are helping to make our dreams come true!

Secretly though, you are an agent of the Intergalactic Council sent on a clandestine mission to explore planets infiltrated by three alien races known as The Red Hegemony who plan to invade the peaceful worlds of Intergalactic Alliance. \nFind all their world-shattering Super Weapons, using your Combat Skills, Diplomacy, and Super Science, and stop them before it is too late!\nPulp Invasion is a game designed by Todd Sanders for 1\u20132 players that lasts 30 minutes.\nFor Italian backers, please click below to be linked to our Italian partner. \nPour la version FR, il faut cliquer sur le lien suivant, c'est Philibertnet qui s'en occupe bien \u00e9videmment ! \nPulp Invasion is the second game in the \"Pulp\" series. We managed to obtain the rights to use an amazing array of 75 pulp magazine covers, so that we can dress this game in the period apparel that it deserves.\nGalaxy/Astonishing magazines covers\nThe game is played in a series of rounds. The core mechanism is a bag builder (like a deck building game but with cubes) Each round has two phases:\n Encounter: During this phase you will explore several planets, meet Guardforces, Agents and Events. You need to resolve each card with only 2 Actions - Engage or Evade. Both actions are necessary to removes cubes from the bag you do not want, and draw the cubes you need at the end of the Encounter Phase.\n Planet Search: Now that you have scoured the planets from its dangerous inhabitants, you have the opportunity to find a Super Weapon by drawing cubes from the bag. The better you have played during the Encounter phase, the more chance you will have the find the Super Weapons needed to win the game.\nIn Pulp Invasion, you play a Captain with a crack crew and ship! The base game contains 6 captains which are a gauge of replayability!\nThe dice in Pulp Invasion are resource trackers, tracking the special actions of your ship and its crew. SO they are never rolled. We decided to make them embossed with white icons. \n\n3 races of Aliens are preparing to invade the peaceful worlds of the Intergalactic Alliance. They are already infiltrated everywhere and will influence the actions you take when you set foot on the different planets. Hurry and discover the Super Weapons in order to thwart their demonic plans ...\n\nBecause Todd Sanders, the designer is an unstoppable fountain when he starts designing, we decided to release the Pulp Invasion X1 expansion at the same time: More adventurers to explore the new planets with and new Alien allies to beat, plus the 2 Player variant...\n\n\nYou can download the English rules HERE , the French rules ICI, and the Spanish rules HERE\nEnglish rules of the extension HERE,  r\u00e8gles en FR de l'extension HERE and the Spanish rules of the extension HERE. \n\n The replayability of the game is immense and comes from several factors:\nthe Abilities of the 6 Captains of the base game coupledwith the choice of Action dice with special icons.\nthe order of appearance of the Aliens who will influence one of the 3 Encounter decks.\nthe order of the Encounter cards in each deck allows you to vary the Engage and Evade Strengths of those begns you encounter.\nThe understanding of the Super Weapons also influences the game.\nThe level of difficulty of the game you choose during setup.\nthe order of appearance of the Planets to explore and the Location cards will allow you, the Captain, to never play two games in a row with the same path in the Intergalactic Universe ...\nAnd if all that was not enough for you, because I know that it is not enough for you, the X1 extension cards add more!\nAs a big fan of Pulp magazines, the stunning illustrations give a unique look to the Pulp Invasion game, as we dive into the Golden Age of Science Fiction. The talent of the illustrators of the time is highlighted thanks as we travel from planet to planet (and never in the same direction), in order to discover, how to use and understand the far futuristic Super Weapons!\nEncounter card\nThe bag seeker mechanism is dusted with the very simple choice of only 2 perfectly balanced actions, each having an advantage and a disadvantage.\nThe management of your special abilities as a space adventurer is crucial. The basic game contains 6 Captains with a varied combinations of actions.\nCaptain card\nThe original 5 embossed dice (6 with the extension X1) used as an action tracker make the games strategically controllable.\nThe choice of difficulty levels in the game help you familiarize you with the actions.\nWe'd love for you to try Pulp Detective Invasion before you back the campaign! The game has been implemented on Tabletopia, and you can play for free here:\nThe game is balanced as it is. Adding more stretch goals is dangerous and increases the production time, making it unpredictable at the end.\nThe box already has all the components required to play the game, and they are the best quality possible. Moreover, more SGs multiply the number of mistakes during the fulfillment process, and they prevent us from perfectly planning the shipping costs of the game. Nobody likes mistakes.\nMore Captains, or More Aliens and Planet cards would be awesome to add though...\nAVStudioGames PLUS represents the games I like, with a strong theme and gorgeous graphics.\nPulp Invasion is very different from Pulp Detective, but still in the Pulp Universe. It will be the second game in the series: Both games are more accessible than the games I tend to design and usually release under the AVSG label. But we are a single-man company and my games are not distributed by major distributors. I don't use Kickstarter as a pre-order platform; I use Kickstarter to fund my games.\nIf you pledge now, you help me to fund the game, which won't exist without your assistance.\nYou will choose the version you want when I send the survey to collect the shipping address, easy!\nTodd Sanders lives in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he works as a graphic designer, publisher and furniture maker. He has a great renown as a solo board game designer and is also a friend! \nI have designed and developed several boardgames during the last 10 years such like - Clinic Deluxe Edition, Tramways, Small City, Card City XL, Town Center - and many expansions for these games.\nBeing an unconditional fan of Pulp Magazines, I was immediately hooked by Todd's game. The graphics remind me of my collection of books and magazines from this golden age of Science Fiction!\nLike our past campaigns for games such as Pulp Detective, Tramways, the Tramways Expansions, Card City XL, we have respected the delivery time, and in some case, boxes were even delivered earlier than expected (depending on how complex production of the game has been).\nWe expect the game to be ready for December, the embossed dice are the most complex part of the components to produce, and samples of them are already in process.\nPlease read the table to know the exact shipping costs that will be charge during the payment process: no surprise !\nAll pledges can be refunded in full up to 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign.\nIf you apply for a refund more than 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter, we will only be able to refund 80% of your pledge.

That's about 4% larger than the normal size of a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle.\nWe imported the highest-quality puzzle cardboard in the world (1.9mm Eska \"blue\" stock) from the Netherlands and invented some new printing techniques so the pieces snap together and stay snapped\nThese puzzles have been extensively playtested to make the experience as smooth and engaging as possible from the moment you open the box to the moment you place the last piece of the last segment\nWhen you're done with the puzzle, everything can be reset and all of the secret compartments close back up with velcro so you can share the puzzle with a friend or solve it again later.\nNo puzzle dust!!\nPuzzle Art\nMost puzzles start with stock art of some trees or cats or something. We wanted each of our puzzles to make a fantastic, tiny world. And we wanted the art to tell a story as you solve it. So we worked closely with independent artists like Sarah Becan, Boya Sun, and Felicia Chiao to create beautiful one-of-a-kind puzzle images loaded with tiny details, story quirks, and easter eggs.\n\"The Happy Isles\" by Sarah Becan\n\"The Mystic Maze\" by Boya Sun\n\"The Sunny City\" by Felicia Chiao\nCustom Dielines\nTo make the magical ending work right, we had to customize the shape of every single piece in all three puzzles. While we were at it, we also made sure that the individual puzzle-piece shapes highlighted the cool art details instead of cutting them in half.\nJigsaw puzzles start as one big piece of cardboard, and then a specially designed cutting tool called a die comes down like a stamp and slices it into a thousand pieces.\nThe die for the \"Happy Isles\" puzzle\nUsually, the tolerance for that slice is about 3mm. But to pull off the magical ending in our Series One puzzles, we needed a 0.5mm tolerance. Nobody had done that before, so we had to work closely with our puzzle factory create new quality-control and die-cutting techniques to make it happen. Some of the roughly 3,000 blades that make up our dies actually had to be precise to within 0.1mm \u2014 30 times more precise than a regular puzzle. \nAn excerpt from Simon\u2019s briefing for the puzzle factory\n One of the nice side effects of making a more precise die and using super high-quality puzzle cardboard is the pieces click together in a really satisfying way and stay together even if you need to move the puzzle.  \n Magical Surprise \nIt\u2019s always exciting to pick up a new puzzle with an image you like and then open the box and start putting together the corners and edges. But after a while, you get to the part of the puzzle where you need to assemble 400 pieces of blurry sky. And then when the puzzle's about 75% done, that feeling of \u201cwhat am I doing with my time\u201d creeps in. Eventually the last piece finally goes in and the puzzle is over. We\u2019ve always found that part a little anticlimactic.\nSo we came up with a whole new way for a puzzle to end. When you place the last piece of what you thought was the end of the puzzle, you unlock a whole new part of the experience \u2014 a final act that includes both a magical illusion and a completion to the puzzle's narrative. We playtested these puzzles hundreds of times with people all over the world to figure out how to make this special ending as clear and engaging as possible, and we hope you're going to love it.\n\"The Happy Isles\" 1000-piece puzzle\n\"The Mystic Maze\" 1000-piece puzzle\n\"The Sunny City\" 1000-piece puzzle", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're working with our long-time manufacturing partner Ad Magic to deliver these puzzles to you on time.

Darkball rewards accuracy, reaction times, as well as creativity. As the pieces are rearranged, the ball can travel in any direction, and down any path with no limits to the number of players or ways it can be played. \n\n\n\nPaintbrush\nby Carol Mertz and Mary McKenzie\nPaintbrush is a deeply strategic game with pieces act as both brush and canvas. Players take turns rearranging the dynamic pieces to spread their color onto as many blank canvasses as they can. Simple mechanics mean the game can be picked up easily, but the strategic depth allows for repeated play and the possibility of mastery. \n\n\n\nGroup Therapy \nby Brett Taylor\nSeparate the introverts.

Reactor takes inspiration from competitive fighting games, and distills them down to an intense contest of reflexes and concentration.\n\n\nRAID\nby Mark Mayer and Justin Baker\nRAID places you in command of a viking horde, competing with other players to grab as much territory as you can. It's an intense game of strategy and prediction, as each player secretly inputs orders into the AI-powered Blinks game pieces, then watches as skirmishes play out in real time.\n\n\n\nPirates & Lasers\nby Theo Johnson, Ian Cummins, Priscilla McGann, and Michael Cooper \nPirates & Lasers is a strategic struggle between ghost pirates and incompetent laser-wielding tourists. Keep the ship sailing as long as you can while lasers tear your ship asunder, managing resources and preventing damage to critical areas.\n\nGrowing Game Library\nYou are backing much more than just the latest 6 games.

Blinks is a product of curiosity, exploration and excitement from the design, tech, and gaming communities. From workshops at Maker Faires to game jams with Playcrafting, IndieCade, and the NYU Game Center, lots of people have been brought together by Blinks.\nKickstarter Video by Tom Caswell\nAnd More...\nNick Bentley, Luis Rodriguez, Diana Peterson, Lingyi Rose, Justin Lamb, Nick Soni, Winston Struye, Shiyun Liu, Justin Ha, Kris Atanasoski, Junege Hong, Armin Minassian, David Khananov, Pedro Benitez, Andrew Saldivar, Xiao Yang Feng, Bill Cowles, Sophie Lefebvre, Celia Pearce, Em Lazer-Walker\n While at the MIT Media Lab in the Playful Systems group, I was researching emergent behavior, complex systems, and cooperation. I was simulating natural systems such as swarm behavior like a flock of birds, ant colonies, or fireflies and forest fires. I designed little hexagonal tiles that could think for themselves, respond to touch, and communicate with each other.\nMy fellow lab mates asked if they could design games for the platform. I agreed to a short game jam session and in under 3 hours, we had designed the first game for Blinks, Fracture. It went on to be a finalist at IndieCade. This is how it all began.\nWe couldn't be more excited to have you join the Blinks Community!\n-Jonathan + the Move38 team\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them. \nPledges managed and fulfilled with the helpful tools of Backerkit.\n Honored to be one of the \"Best New Products on the Planet\"", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've run 4 successful Kickstarter campaigns and delivered above and beyond on each and every one. Our last campaign for Blinks was by far the most ambitious, with everything built from the ground up, and I can proudly say, the hardest part is behind us. We have the world's best toy manufacturer producing our parts and a supply chain that has been through thick and thin. We've built to tolerances that simply put, look beautiful and feel great. And most importantly, we are adding slack so that we can scale quickly. It probably means more to hear from one of our previous backers so feel free to read the hundreds of comments on our previous campaigns, here is one I think captures it nicely:\n\n\"Got mine in California and you guys knocked it out of the park with this product!! From package to product to overall experience, this is truly one of those rare cases where a maker can out-Apple Apple by giving more attention to detail than any large company can.\"\n\n\"Thank you Jonathan & Move38 Team for this piece of great product. Thanks to you I will still believe that Kickstarter projects can be achievable. You all made a really good job!!!\" \n\nIn short, this product is already designed and tested and now it only gets cooler because the new games are new software, and while I would typically not be caught dead saying \"software is easy,\" I will say, I think at this point, it is much easier than the hills we've climbed to bring a new and unusual game system into the world.\n\nFrom a small group of incredibly dedicated people, working with some of the most talented people I've ever met, we achieve a lot, do it with transparency and would love to have you join us.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nBlinks have been designed to be cherished as beautiful design objects to be held in the hand. They come with a protective carrying case or \"Sushi Roll\" that keeps you from losing your Blinks in addition to keeping them in great condition. The games are designed to last until the end of time, just like traditional board games before them, but far sturdier than paper or cardboard.\nReusability and recyclability\nBeyond the bullet-proof materials that create the durable enclosure for Blinks, they are open-source and reprogrammable. Blinks can be used to play the games they know and games that haven't even been invented yet. Tired of Blinks being Blinks? No prob, you can use the Arduino IDE to turn your Blinks into your very own smart device.\nSustainable materials\nBlinks packaging is made entirely of biodegradable materials, specifically paper pulp and paper products instead of the all too common plastic inserts or blister packaging.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Access to KS Discounts", "descp": "Interested in backing but not sure what you want to get?

Gym equipment, fridges, car mounts and more\u2026 it sticks to them like magic!\n\n\n\nThe ohsnap grip has worked with every wireless charger on which it's been tested, but we cannot guarantee compatibility with all wireless chargers. For 100% confidence in compatibility, opt for our magnetic wireless charger, snapcharge.\n\nNot only did we take the phone grip to the next level, but we also added to it with the first ever magnetic wireless charger, Snapcharge. Snapcharge uses the Qi charging standard which works with almost all devices including wireless charging enabled phones, Airpods, and more.\nWith snapcharge, you can pick up and use your phone without interrupting the charging process! :)\nSnapcharge sticks to your magnetic car mount for a quick and easy charge, on the go.\n In-depth look at snapcharge:\n While snapcharge works with every phone that has wireless charging capabilities, we cannot guarantee wireless charging compatible with all cases.\nPLAY\n\n\n\nWe meticulously engineered the grip to be incredibly thin, at only 3mm.\nWon\u2019t get caught on your pants!\n\nIt also fully rotates, so you can get the best possible angle that works for your unique gripping style.\n The ohsnap grip is designed with ultra-strength, tear-resistant silicone that is guaranteed to last millions of cycles.  \nPLAY\n\nNo matter what happens, your ohsnap grip is backed by our forever ohsnap guarantee.\nIf your ohsnap grip gets damaged or broken, we will replace it for free, no matter what.\nWithin 1 year: Free replacement, we cover shipping!

In 3 steps, ohsnap is attached securely and you're ready to go.\n           Snapstand: $1,000,000 Stretch Goal!\nIntroducing snapstand, the magnetic mounting stand for convenient viewing & multitasking!\nEffortless mounting with snapstand means no more picking up your phone to check notifications or send a quick text. It\u2019s awesome at home or work!\nHow it works:\nPLAY\n\nIt\u2019s been meticulously engineered to work seamlessly with the ohsnap grip and/or snapcharge, so it\u2019ll be the perfect add-on to your pledge.

Because this estimate is based on our expected volume for this campaign, it could be subject to change depending on the final result. These charges may also change if you add additional products during the survey process. We want to keep this process as simple and accurate as possible, while avoiding any false promise or unexpected charges.\nCustoms, Duty, and VAT charges: In some cases, international backers outside of the USA will be required to pay additional customs, duty, and/or VAT charges. We cannot control this additional charge, and it will be the backers responsibility to cover once they receive the selected reward. Any questions regarding this additional charge should be addressed directly with the backers customs office.\n\nHow to Add an Extra ohsnap grip, snapcharge, or snapstand?  \nAdding items to your pledge is simple and easy, just click the green link below and add $15 (for ohsnap), $30 (for snapcharge), or $20 (for snapstand) to your existing pledge total and redeem the additional unit in the post-campaign survey. \nWatch video below:\nPLAY\n\n Click here to increase your pledge. \nBecause of our dedication to the vision of ohsnap, the ohsnap grip went through multiple iterations and 3D-printed prototypes every day.

We feel however that we built this risk into our published time table, and that what is estimated here is realistic. The prototypes we have are extremely high fidelity and already work up to our standards, without having to rely on hypotheticals of tooled parts. I've been developing products for over 12 years and whenever this can be accomplished, it substantially reduces the risk of the mass produced version of the product. All the processes, materials, and standards we are using are well known and understood.\n\nThat said, sometimes complete unknowns can occur outside of our control.

Click the image above to head to our website and pre-order the game.\nPRE-ORDER LINK: https://buttonshygames.com/products/food-chain-island\nOn this forgotten island in a tiny corner of the ocean the animals are hungry! Your goal is to influence the wildlife - and arrange their meals - so there is only one animal left!\nFood Chain Island is the next Button Shy Wallet Game, and the first in what we are calling our simply solo series. These are games that are one player only, light on rules, and big on replayability.  \nLet's get into what makes Food Chain Island so awesome!\nStart by shuffling the cards and making a 4X4 grid island of animals with the sea animals off to the side.  \nOn a turn, you must move one land animal one space in one of the four cardinal directions so it\u2019s placed over another animal that is 1-3 numbers lower in value. In this way, you can move the \u20188\u2019 animal over a 7, 6 or 5. \nWhen you do this, place the card on top of the lower card. This how an animal eats another animal.\nWhen cards are stacked on one another, they are considered to be the number on the top. The stack of cards now moves as one.\nWhen you move a card to eat another, you activate the ability on the card that just ate another. This special effect is mandatory and must be applied. In some cases, the ability will benefit you, and in others it will make the game harder.\nThe sea animals are there to help you out. At any time you may discard a sea animal and perform its special ability. Once a sea animal is used, it is discarded. \nThe game ends when only one animal remains or if you are unable to eat an adjacent animal. \nIf you only have one animal left, congratulations! You are an Ecological Expert.\nIf you have two animals left, nice job! You are an Accidental Matchmaker.\nIf you have three animals left, you just made it through! You are still an Island Intern. \nOtherwise, if you have 4+ animals, you have lost the game and need to keep trying.\nFurther Challenges\nTo make the game more difficult, randomly remove one or both of the sea animals. In addition, you can explore these alternate card layouts.\nYou can print and play the game today! The black and white version, along with unedited prototype rules is available at PNP Arcade.\nLINK: https://www.pnparcade.com/products/food-chain-island-kickstarter-preview\nFor a complete playthrough, check out Matt Upton's video below: \nMore to come as we update this image. :)\nAlso available here is Food Chain Island: Tough Skies, a three card expansion that will make your games just a little more challenging. At the beginning of the game, shuffle and place one card face-up into the play area. Do not use the others. During the game, you must activate, resolve and discard the air animal. The air animal must be resolved before the end of the game. For an additional challenge, use 2 or all 3 air animals.\n\n...\n-What's Eric Playing\nFULL REVIEW: https://whatsericplaying.com/2020/05/25/food-chain-island/\n-Hey Meepling\nFULL REVIEW: http://meepling.com/2020/05/22/food-chain-island-review-eat-your-way-to-the-top/\n-The Cardboard Hoard\nFULL REVIEW: https://www.punchboardmedia.com/home/2020/5/25/the-cardboard-hoard-initial-thoughts-on-food-chain-island\n-Boards and Bees\nFULL REVIEW: https://boardsandbees.wordpress.com/2020/05/22/0961/\n\n\nIn previous campaigns we created expansion material and used it as stretch goals. Since 2018, we've just given it away from the start.  So no worries on whether we'll hit it or not, you are getting bonus content if you pledge here. The free expansion for this campaign is Friendly Waters, a 3 card expansion of additional sea animals to help you along the way. You can shuffle these in with the sea animals in the base game, then draw 2 for a normal difficulty, and draw less for an additional challenge.\nWe have a whole bunch of games in our library.\nIf you want to add more games to your order, you can do one of two things:\nUS Backers only - to order games that ship now - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"0520impatient\" to get 15% off of your order. Your website order will ship now, as long as you don't  order any pre-order items, otherwise the entire order will ship as soon as everything comes in.

These games will all ship together with your  Kickstarter rewards.\nInternational Backers only - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and   place an order using the coupon code \"0520international\" to get free shipping on your extra game(s). Note: The limit on this offer is 3 wallet games (and up to 3 expansions) total, including anything that you order at Kickstarter. Anything above 3 wallet games (and 3 expansions) will end up bumping into the next shipping tier, which can be as much as  $10 on international orders. These games will all ship together with your Kickstarter rewards.\nA few notable games available in our library are Tussie Mussie, Sprawlopolis and Circle The Wagons.\nScott Almes is best known for the Tiny Epic series by Gamelyn Games. He's gone even bigger with Heroes of Land, Air and Sea and this time he's going even smaller. We first met in 2012 when Scott designed a game for our Storyteller Cards, and we've been looking for a chance to work together since.\nAnnie Wilkinson was born in Saskatchewan, Canada in 1966 to a family that encouraged artistic pursuits of all kinds -  including writing, drawing, photography and  music. This is our first time working together and it was a wonderful experience. I couldn't imagine a more perfect style for the game. More of Annie's work can be seen at http://www.advocate-art.com/annie-wilkinson\nGraphic Design by Jason Greeno\nRules Editing by Michael Lee\nWe have an awesome following of repeat customers. As a result, we've built the Board Game of the Month Club.\nIt's a subscription service where you receive unreleased microgames,  promo cards, expansion content, and Kickstarter discounts.... every month. Supporters will receive from $1, $2, $5 to $10 off of EVERY WALLET GAME THAT WE MAKE. (See the $1 level, that's where the members back the projects).\nOur 2020 $5 packages include an episode of Personal Space, a solo game that has multiplayer interactions. It's part roll and write, part campaign, part digital, part real life, part fantasy. There are stickers and everyone receives some unique cards and unique combinations of cards. It's launching very soon, and it's our most ambitious project yet and it will emerge throughout the year.\nIt also includes Trolling For Trouble by Mike Mullins. In your first month you'll get the 6 card starter kit and then each month after you'll receive a card to expand the game. Trolling For Trouble is a 3+ player bluffing and negotiation game where you play the monsters luring the heroes into battle.\nOur $10 packages include all of the above and something extra. Generally it's a tiny game (up to 9 cards), or some expansion / promo cards for our existing games. We have a Sprawlopolis expansion coming in the next few months, and we're working on many more.\nAnd our $20 package includes all of the above and a copy of the featured wallet game (or the wallet game of your choice). The featured wallet games also come with any expansion material that is given away in the Kickstarter campaigns (like the solo expansion here).\nIf that sounds cool to you, check out the Board Game of the Month Club on Patreon!\nhttp://www.patreon.com/buttonshy\nThank you for checking out Food Chain Island!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith our method of publishing and using multiple manufacturers, there's always a chance that one part of the game could come in with an error, leading to delays. We've been able to minimize these errors in recent years, but they can happen from time to time. We've also upped our staff internally to make sure we can hit intended deadlines.\n\nWith COVID-19 some of our suppliers have been delayed, so we've been allowing additional time in our estimations and setting up backup suppliers as well. Our staff is also minimized at this time, so we are allowing additional time for a smaller staff to assemble and ship games. \n\nOur two unfulfilled projects are moving along according to our updated schedule.

You are racing down the streets, desperate to escape into the safety of the countryside. If your cart is the first out of town you and your cart-mates win! Or do you? Some villagers on your cart may secretly already have the plague. If you leave town with a plagued villager on your cart, you will catch the plague and lose! What will you do to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen? And who will you trust (or betray) along the way? \nBristol 1350 is a social deduction and light strategy game for 1-9 players. Learn in 10 minutes and play in 20-40 minutes.\n Thank you to all of our backers for an incredible campaign!\nIf you missed the campaign you can make a late pledge here until fall 2020.\nBackers can view project updates for information about delivery and add-ons.\nPlease visit our website or Facebook for the latest information on Bristol 1350.\nWe are excited to offer a Deluxe edition of the game! Depending on later demand, this Deluxe edition may be exclusive to Kickstarter, and at most it will be in rare distribution or only available at conventions. Beyond the core Standard edition of the game (+9 extra Kickstarter characters + stretch goals) the Deluxe edition includes: \nThe 6 Deluxe coins to scale.\nEvery Kickstarter backer of Bristol 1350 (Standard or Deluxe) will receive 9 extra character cards in a special foil pack to add to their core copy of the game (for 18 total characters!) These characters will not be available after Kickstarter and are our way of saying thank you. We will reveal a new character every few days in the section below!    \n\n\nWe have upgraded every single component in the game with the space available in the box. Each upgrade represents our dedication to making high-quality and high-performing games at an affordable price. While we hope to include most of the upgrades listed above in future editions, they are only guaranteed for this first Kickstarter Standard and Deluxe printing of the game.   \nThe level of textural detail on the book, front and back, is kind of mouthwatering.\nBristol 1350 is a social deduction (lying & backstabbing) and light strategy game for 1-9 players. Learn in 10 minutes and play in 20-40 minutes. The game is enjoyable at all player counts, with lower counts leaning towards strategy and higher counts leaning towards social deduction, lying, and trust.\nIn the game each player begins in one of the three carts behind the starting line. Your goal is to be on the first cart to escape from the town. However, if anyone on your cart has the plague when you finish, everyone on that cart dies of the plague! Play continues until an all-healthy cart crosses or until everyone has the plague.   \nYou can view the full rules and print and play at this link. Note that the rulebook design is still underway, and if you want to play the print and play you'll need to construct your own dice and carts.\nYou can play for free online with Tabletop Simulator or with Tabletopia. \nAs they become available, translations of the rulebook will be available on our website. We currently have translations available in French, German, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, and Greek. \nSome of the intriguing mechanics are discussed by The Board Game Critic in this video. \nA full playthrough of a 5-player game can be seen at this link. \nA full playthrough of a 1-player game can be seen at this link. \nBristol 1350 is Volume 4 in the Dark Cities Series! Each Volume is a stand-alone game that comes in the same sized faux book box, focuses on a particular city and year, and includes a dark or mysterious element in its game play. Each game accommodates at least 2-9 players. \nGames in the Dark Cities Series have already sold over 150,000 copies and are now played around the world! We're already hard at work on Volume 5, and we will continue expanding the series. We know your game closet is a mess. Start your bookshelf collection of games with the Dark Cities Series! Each of these games is available in certain reward levels and as add-ons.\nYou can add an unlimited number of copies of any games in the Dark Cities Series to your pledge! Just add the amounts listed above and after the campaign you'll select which extra games you'd like to be added to your order based on how much extra money you pledged. If you have any questions, please see the FAQ section, post a comment, or shoot us a message. \nYour shipping cost does not increase for add-ons regardless of your location or the amount of extra games you order. You will receive all add-on games at the same time that all of the Kickstarter rewards are received (estimated delivery April 2021).  \nThe 18 original character paintings by Sarah Keele are available to purchase! The paintings are 8 x 10 inches and made with mixed media acrylic on masonite board. You can see some of the intricate details below. Email sarahmkeele@gmail.com for more details or to check availability of a specific character.    \nThough this is not an add-on you can get through the campaign, the people at Next Level Board Gaming are selling 3D-printer files so that you can create an EPIC 3D version of the Bristol 1350 board that you can use with your copy of the game. You can see more details by clicking the picture below.\nRegardless of order size or add-ons, shipping costs are $6 USA, $8 UK/EU, $10 Australia/Canada, $12 for the rest of the world. We work hard to find the best shipping rates out there, and we subsidize some of the shipping costs so that you don't have to pay as much. \nTo avoid extra VAT or customs fees, games will ship to depots around the world (USA, UK, EU, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong) before being shipped to you. For non-depot countries, in most cases there will not be extra VAT costs because the price of our games is low enough to avoid the duties threshold.\nIf your order is lost or returned due to unforeseen circumstances, we will attempt to reship your game one time, free of charge. If you provided incorrect shipping information, you will be responsible for the reshipment fee. Due to unreliable mail systems, we will not perform reshipments destined for Brazil, Ukraine, Russia, or South Africa. \nThese days there are many projects that wait to charge shipping until AFTER the campaign ends in order to shift the risk from the creators to the backers. We have \"done our homework\" in regards to shipping costs and are prepared to take on unexpected risk. What you pay now for shipping is ALL that you will pay for this reward.\nDISCOUNTED PRICE | Normal MSRP of the Standard Edition will be $25. If we release the Deluxe Edition to the public it will be at least $45. We also offer the best shipping prices we can during the Kickstarter campaign.\nKICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE CARDS | The 9 Kickstarter Exclusive character cards (for a total of 18 characters in your game) will never be available again and will be unavailable to the public. Additionally, campaign stretch goals, as well as the Deluxe version, are only guaranteed through Kickstarter.\nEARLY ACCESS | Receive and play the game before anyone else in the world. \nJOIN OUR TEAM | Get first-in-line knowledge and insight into the project, and a direct line of communication to us as the creators. We will take your feedback into account before launching production.\nWe fell in love with the Kickstarter community when we launched our first game, Salem, back in 2015. Those backers are the ones that allowed us to quit our day jobs and make games full time. We've had more great experiences with the launch of Tortuga 1667 and Deadwood 1876. The feedback, support, trust, and positivity from the community is incredible. We consider each Kickstarter backer to be a close ally in our game-making endeavors and we'll do everything we can to protect your trust in us.\nOur thoughts are with those around the world suffering from Covid-19. We have been planning and preparing for this launch for over two years, but it has coincidentally lined up with the pandemic that our world now faces. We considered delaying the project but after a lot of thought and encouragement from our community we ultimately decided to launch. As with all our games, part of this game's purpose is to educate about the history of the world. Bristol 1350 explores the history of the worst pandemic our world has ever faced: the Black Death. The people of 1350 faced huge challenges, and today those challenges are perhaps more relatable than ever. We will be donating $3,000 from our own pockets to Action Against Hunger to assist in getting food and medicine for those most in need. (Per Kickstarter regulations, funds raised within Kickstarter will not be directly donated and have no effect on the donation amount).\nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 4th project, and our first 3 have been delivered on time and as promised. Our factory is at full capacity and our shipping partners are optimistic that by next year when this is delivered there will be no insurmountable issues in regards to Covid-19. However, these are unique times and we will keep our backers updated on any unforeseen issues that may arise. As you can see from our photos, samples of the game have already been produced by our manufacturers and designs are complete. We just need to raise the funds and say go! \n\nSalem 1692: \"I have backed over 46 projects and I just wanted to say this project has been an absolute delight to have been a backer for. Your updates have been insightful, but not overbearing. You clearly put a lot of time, thought, and effort into this game and it really shows. I was impressed with how fast this project came together. It was a fast, well organized campaign. Kudos to you and thank you for a wonderful end product. I couldn't be happier.\" -Snuffles00\n\nTortuga 1667: \"I backed this and another project that ended a day prior. The way things have gone with the other project have given me an even greater appreciation for not only the great game you made, but the well executed Kickstarter. Thank you again!\" -Bored Gamer\n\nDeadwood 1876: \"Thank you again for such a wonderful campaign and game! All your games are creative, refreshing, and each have unique mechanics that keep the fun going for hours. The historical component too makes for an added boon. Thank you also for a unique genuineness you bring to your customer experience. It is a prize how you answer each customer individually and how you care about the quality of your interactions as much as you care about the quality of your product and gameplay. I\u2019m excited for the fourth city and experience!\" -Steph Troyer\n\nAfter the campaign we will use a pledge manager system called CrowdOx to send a survey to the email associated with your Kickstarter account. You will be able to choose your add-on orders and provide your shipping information at that time. If you change addresses before we ship your rewards, you will be able to access your survey up until a few weeks before we ship.

We sold out quickly, and then got busy putting out other games. Well, here it is again. Jump in fast and tell your friends because this project only lasts a short time!\nCoin Count Update\nWith the increasing number of metal Campaign Coins that we're giving away, here's a table to help you determine what you're getting with the total funding amount of $30,000: \nI'll try to keep this updated through the project's end, each time we pass a $1K threshold.\nWhat is Island Siege?\n Number of Players: 1-4\n Play Time: 12 minutes per player\n Ages: 14+\nIsland Siege is a card game of colonization in the West Indies. Players build forts using stones from their supply, then move colonists to forts to populate them. Colonists in turn construct buildings and ships, which then house the colonists. Buildings provide players with special abilities, while ships are sent to lay siege to the opponent\u2019s forts.\nThe goal is for players to get all of their colonists into play on their forts, buildings and ships. Be careful, though, whenever a fort is destroyed by an opponent\u2019s fleet all of the colonists on that fort and its buildings are returned to the player's imperial board to start again! Alternately, players may win by earning 20 gold from constructing buildings and ships. Winning requires a keen balance of building and laying an Island Siege!\nYou can download the not-quite-finished rules here. You can get solo rules here, and Captains expansion rules from here!\nIf you're more the video-watching sort, here's an Island Siege preview that includes how to play Island Siege, by the Board Game Mechanic.\nHere's what players have said about the first edition of Island Siege.\nPurge Review of Island Siege 1st Edition\nTop Two-Player Game - The Board Game Captain!\nLynn, Ales and The Board Game Captain ran through their top ten 2-player games, and the Captain called Island Siege his favorite! (That's a fancy title page!) The Island Siege part starts at around 31:30.\n Customer Reviews\n The anniversary edition of Island Siege contains\n Engraved dice - No more stickers! The Anniversary Edition will contain engraved resin dice. Also, one of the dice will be a different color to indicate it is only used when enough colonists have been moved off of the imperial board.\n Two sets of  Kickstarter-exclusive metal Campaign Coins (26 total)! These metal coins will only be part of the Kickstarter experience. The retail version of the game will include cardboard punch board coins. EDIT: Stretch goals have unlocked extra coins, and more coins get unlocked each time we cross a $1K funding boundary!\n Components and rules for up to four players! The original two-player game included red and yellow colonists. The Anniversary Edition also includes green and blue colonists as well as additional coins, cubes and other components necessary for four players.\n Deluxe two-layer player imperial boards. The new imperial boards includes an island with a quarry to store accumulated stones and a port to dock your ship. The boards will be printed on a thick cardboard. Indentations keep pieces from shifting.\n Ramparts and Coquina expansions from original. The original Island Siege Kickstarter featured two expansions that weren't available in the retail version of the game. Ramparts adds 24 new forts, buildings and ships, while Coquina introduces soft pink coquina stones and cards that make forts much harder to eliminate.\n Solo rules and components. Dan has created new rules for playing Island Siege against the Ghost Captain!\n Stretch goals! Including 20 extra Captains cards and rules, 2 extra boards and rules for the Monuments expansion, and even more deluxe Campaign Coins!\nCoquina, Ramparts and the Ghost Captain\nThree expansions are included with the base pledge. These aren't stretch goals - they are included in the base pledge!\nCoquina\nThe Coquina expansion is included in the base Island Siege game pledge level. There are six new cards - 3 forts, 2 buildings and a ship card. It also contains 5 new stones - all of them pink to represent the soft coquina stones that compressed and gave way around cannonballs shot from ships instead of shattering. Since there are not  pink dice faces in Island Siege, these stones can only be removed by a second wave attack.  \nRamparts\nThe Ramparts expansion from the original print run is also included with the base Island Siege game pledge. Ramparts includes 24 additional forts, buildings and ships.\nGhost Captain Solo Rules\nThe Ghost Captain rules allow for the game to be played solo. Can you best the Ghost Captain?!\nTo add any of these items, just increase the pledge amount by the cost of the item(s) you wish to add. If you are not pledging for the base game, then you can use the Add-Ons Only pledge level to pledge just the add-on amount. \nShipping is one flat rate to your location. Add as many items as you want and the shipping rate won't change!\nExtra Island Siege Games: $29\nTo add extra copies of Island Siege, just add another $29 to your pledge. \nCoin Set (13 coins): $10\nThe base pledge will come with two sets of these super-high quality coins (26 coins in total) but if you want more then just add them to your pledge! Edit: More coins are being unlocked with stretch goals through the end of the project!\nDice:  $10\nDo you already have the Island Siege first edition but want to upgrade the dice? Or maybe you're getting the game but want to have a set of dice for each player!\nThese are the same dice as will ship in the base version of the game - etched, with a different color symbol on each face. The three base attack dice will be one color, while the bonus dice (used when the first level of the imperial board is clear) is darker, as a reminder that not all of the dice should be rolled by default.\nAPE works with companies around the world to do game fulfillment.\nYou will be notified of the shipping to your area when you select a pledge. \nNote: Adding items to your pledge does not change the shipping rate. You will be charged the same shipping rate for ordering a copy of the base game as you would for ordering two copies, or six copies, add-ons, etc.!\nWe put Island Siege on Tabletopia so that you can play online and still practice social distancing.\n Design: Dan Manfredini\n Art: Jared Blando\n Cover Art: Jim Maxwell\n Layout: Daniel Solis and Kevin Hill\n Publisher: Kevin Brusky and APE Games\nDan Manfredini, Designer\nDan Manfredini is a game designer from Round Rock, Texas.

He loves playing games, and for over a decade, he's loved designing games. In 2017, his highest ranked game on BGG was released\u2014Mini Rails. \nWith Mini Rails, Mark condensed the often complex, time-consuming, and calculation-intensive train game, into a highly approachable game time of 60 minutes. Mini Rails scratched the itch of a heavy train game but without sacrificing any depth of play. Gamers loved it.\nMini Express is the next game in the Mark Gerrits Train Series. In Mini Express, Mark Gerrits once again explores the design space of cube rail train games. Cube rail games take an abstract approach to track building, which eliminates issues of track junction tiles or drawing tracks. Once again, players take only one of two choices on their turn: lay track or buy shares. Mini Express not only continues the minimalist spirit of Mini Rails but also brings players a richer gaming experience through clever map design.\nEstablished in 2011, Moaideas Game Design is one of the leading board game publishers in Taiwan. We are a small but focused team of experienced professionals that thrive for excellence in game design, game development, art illustration, graphic design, and manufacturing quality of our games.  \nWe have published well over 24 different titles to date, so we are very familiar with the process of making high-quality board games for the international market & delivering them into your hands.\nNote that the location of this KS project needs to be based on our registered company in Japan as KS is not supported in Taiwan, and thus the base currency of this project is in Japanese Yen (JPY). We have years of experience handling international business in different currencies, and exchange rate fluctuations are always built into our budgets. \nKicktraq stats for Mini Express\nWe've been using Kicktraq since the very beginning, and we are more than happy to let Kicktraq help backers and us understand the performance of our campaign better.

The 19:05 to Paris is armed with a bomb and hurtling towards its destination threatening civilian destruction. On board, the passengers include a Resistance Conspirator, an Mi6 agent and a Prisoner of War on the run. To avert disaster, they have only one hope: an emergency meeting to identify the Saboteur, throw him off and Stop the Train!\n 15 lengths/curves of track\n1 Card deck base & Speedometer\n1 Train Counter\n66 Effect Cards (that change the speedometer)\n10 Character Cards\n10 Character Reference cards\n36 Intervention Cards (that grant special powers)\n18 Voting Cards (to facilitate a secret ballot)\n1 Gameplay Guide\n2 Order of Play Cards\n2 Permits to Travel\n1 Current Player Token\n1 Rail Speed Record  \nNow you're on board, let's tell you how the game works. Stop the Train is a  semi-cooperative, social deduction board game. After a quick set up and the allocation of characters, players discover their two missions:\nMission 1: Stop the Train!\nMission 2: A character-specific objective\nTo win, your character will need to complete both missions. But! There's a saboteur in your midst hellbent on crashing the train, trying to secretly speed the train up at every turn without raising suspicion. The players must put their social deduction skills to the test by collectively identifying the Saboteur to regain control of the train. \nHere's the catch - the actions you take to achieve your second mission may implicate you as the Saboteur. If you're not careful, you'll find yourself wrongly accused as players vote who to throw off the train. On the flip side, if you're suspicions are correct and the Saboteur is ousted, then just maybe you'll be able to hit the brakes and Stop the Train!\nTake a closer look at the passengers on board: \n The game play is simple to pick up and rewarding to replay. For each turn, players:\nDraw 3 Effect Cards and discard 1\nPass the remaining 2 to the next player\n...who chooses to play 1 and discard the other\nThe played card affects the Speedometer\nThe train speeds ahead! \nSounds simple? The players also encounter game events as they speed towards their fate: \nA choice of routes - at the Signal Box, all players must vote between three routes: the Viaduct, the Scenic Route and the Fast Track. The final decision will heavily impact how quickly the train hits Paris. Will you risk a quick route to complete your own mission?  \nEmergency Meeting - Whichever route you choose, the train will cross a bridge in the final stages. Here's your chance to call an Emergency Meeting to identify the Saboteur and throw them off the train! \nBut not everything is as it seems here... there's an Mi6 agent who wants him alive. Stacked with dramatic interventions, no one knows the outcome of the meeting. It is possible the Engineer might lock the doors so no one is thrown off or the accused may attempt to drag another passenger off the train with them.\nIdentifying the real Saboteur dramatically increases the chance of pulling the train to a halt in time... but if they are still on board, a crash looks ever more likely!\nInterventions - not everything will go your way, but you will have two Intervention Cards up your sleeve. Perhaps you will speed past the signal box and dictate the route or maybe put a gun to someone's head and control the Speedometer or... save an innocent passenger from eviction by pulling them back on the train! \nTunnels - in the darkness of the tunnels, you can steal a Permit to Travel. If you have a Permit to Travel, you don't need to achieve your second mission. Whilst you're cooperating with the other passengers to slow the train, you might need the pluck to steal their permit. But be careful, they might steal it back from you! \nEnd of the Game\nThe train stops either when the Effect Cards are exhausted or when the train crashes into Paris station.  \nIf the players can stop the train before the end of the 40km track with their personal mission complete or a permit to travel, they win. If there's a collision at the station, the bomb explodes and the Saboteur wins. \nRulebook\nA preproduction copy of the Game Play manual can be downloaded here.

We've been operating since 2015 and put simply we love to create entertaining experiences.\nThe Battle for Britain, Escape Plan\n As avid fans of co-operative play (like Pandemic, Forbidden Island trilogy) and social deduction games (such as Werewolf, Avalon, Secret Hitler) it was only ever a matter of time before we expanded our creativity into the world of board games. The inspiration came to Brendan unexpectedly from a text conversation with his brother-in-law who has insisted to be credited with royalties; instead, we have offered him the title of Project Muse. From that conversation, the premise of the game - to stop a train hurtling towards its ultimate destination - was born. \nOne year on, we have working prototypes of the game, lots of positive feedback and a Kickstarter campaign to launch the concept. After three comprehensive iterations of play-testing we have arrived at the final version, which marries drama and satisfying game-play. We hope you'll support us!\nProject Team\nBrendan Mills / Game Designer (co-founder of Escape Plan Ltd)\nKerry Mills / Project Director\nPeter Watt / Prototype Developer\nGareth Griffiths / Graphic Designer\nAndrew Hails / Project Muse\nfacebook.com/stopthetraingame | instagram.com/stopthetraingame", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFIRST KICKSTARTER PROJECT \n\nWe're new to the board game category and with that comes a lot of new learnings. Thankfully, we have many years experience in running successful games in a parallel industry: escape rooms. There's a lot of transferred knowledge we bring with us. Whilst we are reaching a new audience for board games, we do have an established following of gamers and marketing experience in the team to extend our reach. \n\nPRODUCTION VALUE\n\nOur default is to always aspire to the highest quality available; the challenge is that this needs balancing with affordability. We're asking for backing for a new project and are aiming for a price point that is attractive to supporters without compromising on component quality. We're working with industry experts to find this balance.\n\nMANUFACTURING & SHIPPING\n\nAs with any large volume order, there is an inherent risk of delay to project delivery. Experience shows us to manage this risk best, we need to work with reputable suppliers who have a track record of delivery high quality projects to an agreed timescale. The COVID-19 outbreak presents many unknowns and may delay the production a little, but happily, we are sourcing from European suppliers so we are unlikely to see significant delays. We have had their assurances that the impact is minimal at this time. \n\nWe have developed the product as far as possible (manufactured prototypes; fully tested game play; artwork design signed off; marketing plan devised) prior to manufacture. Therefore, we do not foresee any delays from our end.

To do so, you're going to need a good ship and a great crew!\nThere's a lot of scallywags out there looking for adventure! So assembling your crew won't be very hard, but pulling together a winning crew... that's a different story.\nYour crew will play a major role in Tiny Epic Pirates. Each crew member brings different advantages to battle and to the actions you'll take. \nThe dice listed at the top of each crew card, and your captain's card, represent what number you'll need to roll to score a hit on another ship! Having multiples of a single number can result in lots of damage, but spreading your numbers out can result in more consistent results. The choice is yours!\nThe icons listed at the bottom of each crew card, and your captain's card, represent bonus actions that can chain together for epic turns! If the first icon matches your chosen action, you'll get to take the action of the second icon for free.\nIn addition to your crew, you'll have your reputation and your exploits. As you prove yourself in battle, your legend will grow and so will your ability to command your ship.\nWinning battles against other pirates, and against notable merchants, will increase your Legend Level. Each new level offers immediate benefits, as well as increases to your ship's movement and the number of dice you roll in battle.\nBut enough talk, you're no landlubber.

Players may also lay siege to these Fortresses for additional rewards. But beware, the Floating Fortresses have a contract with the Royal Navy and if any Pirates show their dirty face around there, the Navy will be on their tail!\nEven with the threat of the Navy though, the precious Silver these markets are known for is simply too alluring to avoid. A lot of blood as been spilled over this Silver. So much that it's known around these seas as Crimson Silver.\n***Kickstarter-Limited Exclusivity - Deluxe content will not enter regular distribution.

Rumors of dead pirates returning to the sea... aboard an ominous ghost ship helmed by the legendary pirate Amdiak...\nSeveral new game elements are added to play including cursed gold, a ghost ship that haunts the players as they try to steal the cursed gold, ancient relics, haunted map cards and even skeleton crew!\nPlayers gain cursed gold by stealing it from the ghost ship and attacking other pirates who possess it. Cursed gold can be traded for an ancient relic said to hold ashes of Amdiak. Bury this relic and break the Curse of Amdiak!\nIf the ghost ship finds catches you though, your captain becomes cursed and you lose your cursed gold.

In 2010, we published Lords of Vegas, a high energy casino-building game. It cemented itself as one of the best games we've ever made, and a favorite of such series as Tabletop, Shut Up & Sit Down, and The Dice Tower. Our 2014 hard-to-find expansion Up! enabled more strategic casino-building and added pieces for more players. But since then, we haven't been able to bring anything new to the game's legions of fans.\nUntil today, that is. Last month, we regained the rights to Lords of Vegas. After five years in the hopper, we're publishing the long-awaited expansion Underworld, filled with mobsters and shady dealers. We're bringing out a 10th Anniversary Boss Bundle, a lush mobster briefcase stocked with poker chips, a felt-lined tray, player piece upgrades, and gambling dice. We're making a 15th anniversary edition of our book Dealer's Choice: The Complete Handbook of Saturday Night Poker. And you can get the previously released versions of the base set and Up! here. We want to reward our fans for supporting our game all these years.\nIf you've never heard of the game, you might want to know... \nThe base set, Up!, and a theory of what the Underworld box might look like.\n\nLords of Vegas is a city-building eurogame in which players are casino moguls turning the desert of Nevada into something even nastier. The game starts in 1940, when Las Vegas is merely cheap motels and one-room poker houses. Of course, you bulldoze them. Over the next few decades, you construct glittering meccas of gambling and debauchery. You can build, remodel, reorganize, and sprawl your casinos along the Strip. Should you come up a few million short in your plans for world domination, take those dollars to a competitor's casino and roll the dice on a gambling spree. Here's what it looks like in play.\nThe game comes with a beautiful board of the Vegas Strip, illustrated by the masterful Franz Vohwinkel. It has 48 casino tiles, 55 cards, 40 player markers, and loads of paper money\u2014and, oh yeah, 48 dice. Yes, we made a eurogame with 48 dice. \nHere's Mike to explain how it works.\nAnd here's Quinns of Shut Up & Sit Down walking you through it.\nWith the strongly recommended expansion Up!, your casinos build skyward, gaining you  more wealth and power. This expands the game to 2-6 players using the base set and Up! The expansion has 48 riser tiles for elevating your casinos, 20 player markers, even more money, and 24 more dice, bringing the total to a spine-rattling 72 dice. If you have a copy of the base set but have never gotten your hands on Up!, please take this opportunity to do so. You'll never play the game the same way again.  \nThe Underworld expansion is a brand new set of characters, events, and properties to enhance your game with that seedy-side-of-Vegas feeling. See below for that. \nHere are some nice people saying nice things about Lords of Vegas:\n\"Lords of Vegas is the perfect simulation of the reality of gambling in Vegas, only sometimes you win.\"\u2014Wil Wheaton, Tabletop \n\"Lords of Vegas is the economic warfare game that we find ourselves recommending the most. The reason that no one should play Monopoly. Ever.\"\u2014Shut Up & Sit Down \n\"I have not seen this level of intensity. It goes back and forth fighting over these (casinos). One of the best games of the year.\"\u2014Tom Vasel, The Dice Tower (both Vasel's and Eric Summerer's top 10 of 2010)  \n\"Buy the game. Now. Do it! I'm the Lord of Vegas.\"\u2014Storm of Paul & Storm, alongside the luminaries Matt Lees, Emma Larkins, Peter Adkison, Matt Forbeck,  Aubrey Cello, Patrick Hillier, and Ignacy Trzewiczek\nCover design for the Underworld box, illustrated by Fastner & Larson.\n\nUnderworld is the Lords of Vegas expansion we've been wanting to make for a decade. Ever since the game came out, people have said, \"This is great, but where's the seedy underbelly of Vegas?\" We've got it for you in Underworld. Faster than you can say \"Those are Terry Benedict's casinos!\" you'll be deep in the muck with mobsters, thieves, grifters, and, worst of all, accountants. Here's Mike with the lowdown.\nThis expansion comes with a new Underworld board by Franz. It depicts downtown Las Vegas, the current site of the Fremont Street Experience, north of the main board's Vegas Strip. This is a work in progress. \nUnderworld board by Franz Vohwinkel. Image not final.\nUnderworld contains 52 cards, all lovingly illustrated by the talented Nate Taylor. Here's how they work. At the start of every turn, you flip out a new Underworld card onto the Underworld board. You then gain a new action called Acquire, which allows you to spend money to buy a single Underworld card. Some give you points in different ways, while others give you money over time. Others provide powers that you can use to alter your gameplay. One card might make sprawling easier, while another gives you more opportunities to gamble every turn. Eventually, who and what you have in your Underworld cards can drastically change your board position by the game's end.\nPlaytest versions shown. Images not final.\nRight now, if you own Lords of Vegas, you can help us perfect this expansion. We've created a print and play with rules and cards, which you can download by going to this page and clicking on the button marked Lords of Vegas Underworld Print and Play. Once you've played with it, go to our feedback form and tell us what you think!\nEach copy of Underworld comes with two promo cards: Time Share and The Big Score. (See below for how to get our charity promo card, Vegas Shutdown.)\nUnderworld is the expansion we've wanted to make for over half a decade. With your help, we can finally introduce the mob to Lords of Vegas.\nThe Boss Bundle is inside your very own mobster briefcase. Image not final.\nFor diehard Lords of Vegas fans, the 10th Anniversary Boss Bundle is the option you want. It's a mobster briefcase box with places to hold the components from the base game, Up!, and Underworld. Check it out. \nPrototype of the Boss Bundle briefcase box. Image not final.\n\nWhen you pull this game off your shelf, we want you to feel like a casino magnate. The briefcase box is 320 mm x 320 mm (fits nicely into a Kallax shelf) but feels weighty and substantial. There's a leather-like exterior, a felt interior, and a removable felt-lined tray with snug spaces for each player's components. It's the box we always wanted Lords of Vegas to be in.\nPrototype of the Boss Bundle briefcase box interior, with the felt-lined tray pulled out. Image not final.\nThe tray is dark wood with a felt-lined interior. There are separate compartments for the casino tiles, Up! risers, property and Underworld cards, and poker chips. The scoring markers, dice, and parking lot markers fit into the recess between the tray and the briefcase wall. The rulebook, base set board, and Underworld board set into the top.\nPrototype of the poker chips. Image and quantities of each denomination are not final.\nFans have asked for poker chips for years. The Boss Bundle'spoker chipsare still in design, but these are some initial concepts. We plan to include 20 each of $1 million, $2 million, $5 million, $10 million, and $25 million chips. The chips we like are high-density plastic with a metal chip inside making them 11.5 grams similar to a clay chip, but more durable. (Poker chips are also available as an add-on for $55 a set.)\nPrototypes and designs for the bags, gambling dice, player pawns, and cars in the player upgrade kit. Nothing here is final.\nThe Boss Bundle also comes with a player upgrade kit. We'll include 60 wooden cars (of a different shape for each player) to use in place of the markers for parking lots. We are including a deluxe version of the scoring tokens, possibly airplanes so you can vroom around on the scoring track like it's a runway at McCarran Airport. The player pack will come with six velvet drawstring bags, one for each player. It will also contain a pair of larger casino gambling dice. (The player upgrade kit is also available as an add-on for $45 a set.)\nDigital prototype of the Vegas Playmat. Image not final.\nThe Boss Bundle will also come with a Vegas playmat. This is a 24x28\" neoprene playmat which features both the base set board (The Strip) and the Underworld board (Downtown Vegas). The playmat comes with the Boss Bundle, but is too big to fit in the briefcase box. (The Vegas playmat is also available as an add-on for $40.)\nSince all people who get the Boss Bundle should have all three boxes, we've added to the bundle a unified rulebook that incorporates the rules of base, Up!, and Underworld.  (The unified rulebook is also available as an add-on for $5.)\nThe 10th Anniversary Boss Bundle comes with a copy of the base set, Up!, Underworld, and Dealer's Choice. Or, if you already own the base set and Up!, you can get it without those at the Boss Bundle (New Stuff Only) level. You can also buy most of these items as add-ons. See below for details on how that works.\nIf you want something really unique, check The Big Score Bundle with You In It. That gets you illustrated into one of our promo cards like The Big Score. You or someone you really like will become a Lords of Vegas denizen forever. We'll send you 10 of your promo card so you can leave your calling card when you next rob the Strip blind. \nThe Dealer's Choice cover from 2005. Phil's drawing a new one for the 15th anniversary edition.\nIn 2005, we joined with our buddy Phil Foglio, whom you might know from the Hugo Award-winning graphic novel series Girl Genius, to write and illustrate the definitive book on dealer's choice poker. We called it Dealer's Choice: The Complete Handbook of Saturday Night Poker. After it went out of print, we were often begged for copies. So we decided to get the rights to that book back too. We're excited to offer a brand new 15th anniversary edition of Dealer's Choice, complete with a new cover. This new edition will be a staple at every poker night you attend.\nThe Dealer's Choice softcover contains the rules to 200 poker games, including old favorites like Omaha and Chicago, and bizarre new constructions like Demolition Man, Black Jack Shellacque, Frankenstein, and Night Baseball of the Living Dead. Plus we've added a bunch of additional games courtesy of our columns in Bluff Magazine. The book also features valuable tips for how to host a poker night, how to design your own games, and how to talk like a poker player. Every copy of the book comes with a PDF and an ebook. It's cool. \n Here's a handy table of what's included in each reward level.   \nWe also have a $1 level for those who just want access to our PledgeManager after the campaign. We know times are tough, so if you are stressing right now about finances, you can just pledge a dollar and we'll let you upgrade later. \nYou can also buy many of the elements of the Boss Bundle as add-ons, using the prices in this chart.\n\nEach backer who receives physical goods will pay the actual cost of shipping their rewards. Final shipping rates and costs will be loaded into our PledgeManager, and you will pay for your shipping via the PledgeManager as well.  We'll charge backers as close to our actual shipping costs for their shipping address as we can for each order. Lone Shark is not making any profit on shipping and handling. Including add-ons in your order will increase shipping costs. See below for our current shipping estimates, based on shipping out of our fulfillment sites of Florida, England, and Australia. (And yes, those \"Rest of World\" numbers are horrible. If you're from those places, we're really sorry about that,) \nAgain, these are estimates. You'll be charged exactly what it costs us to get it to your location, wherever that is. \nWe are game designers. James founded Cheapass Games and the head crustacean at Crab Fragment Labs. His games include Kill Doctor Lucky, Tak: A Beautiful Game, Button Men, Pairs, and Unexploded Cow. Mike is the lead developer and/or designer of Betrayal at House on the Hill, the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, Apocrypha, The Ninth World, Risk Godstorm, and Thornwatch, as well as the author of The Maze of Games, The Kobold Guide to Board Game Design, and Puzzlecraft. Mike and James co-founded Lone Shark Games, and together designed Pirates of the Spanish Main, Unspeakable Words, Fightball, Gloria Mundi, 12 Days, and many other games, and recently collaborated together with the Brothers Chaps on Trogdor!! The Board Game.\nLone Shark Games is a Seattle board game and puzzle company that has made such Kickstarter-fueled games and books as The Maze of Games, Apocrypha, The Ninth World, Thornwatch, and Puzzlecraft. We also are responsible for the design of Betrayal at House on the Hill: Widow's Walk and the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game. You can get all our stuff at our webstore.\nWe're joined by some great artists on Lords of Vegas. Franz Vohwinkel does our boards; he's known for his work on Magic: The Gathering, Dungeons & Dragons, Dominion, and boardgames like Ra and Princes of Florence. Steve Fastner and Rich Larson did the covers for our base set and Up!, and are famous for their comic and pinup art. Nate Taylor is illustrating the Underworld cards; you may know him from his collaborations with Pat Rothfuss, especially The Princess and Mr. Whiffle. \nThis is a strange time to be asking for money for a game. Here's some things we know.\n1. It's the 10th anniversary of this game, and that only comes around once.\n2. We don't know when things will get better. The economy could rev back up quickly, or things could get worse. We just can't know.\n3. We can't print the game without help.\nSo, encouraged by lots of fans on BoardGameGeek, we decided to go ahead with the campaign. Still, most of our opportunities to promote the campaign\u2014conventions, magazines, Twitch play around a table\u2014are not available to us right now. We could use your help. Please share this post as much as you can with people who like games. You can also put this badge on your Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or Kickstarter icon.\nWe also want to give back to the Las Vegas community, which was open when we shot our videos. So we're making a promo card called Vegas Shutdown (named in honor of our other favorite Vegas board game, Henry Stern's Vegas Showdown). Since it's a charity thing, and Kickstarter doesn't do charity campaigns, you can't buy it here. But if you pledge for a physical reward in this campaign, you'll have the first opportunity to get copies of the promo card for an additional $5 each in our PledgeManager. Every charity promo card purchased will help Three Square Food Bank take care of workers affected by the shutdown of the casino industry. Here's the card.\nThat's our reasons for doing this now. Once you're done taking care of your needs for yourself, your family, and your community, if you decide you like the game and would like to contribute, we'd really appreciate it. Thanks, and we hope to see you playing Lords of Vegas around a game table soon.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNeedless to say, we're concerned about the coronavirus pandemic's effect on the production and shipping of this campaign. \n\nWe're acquiring inventory of the last printing of the base set and Up! from Asmodee. We're making new editions of Underworld and Dealer's Choice for this project, and we don't anticipate any manufacturing problems with those. Underworld is being printed by the same printer who printed the base set and Up! They're in the United States, which costs more but avoids problems with tariffs and shipping from China. We expect that our factory and warehouses will be open by the time these need to go to those steps, but of course we cannot know for sure. We are committed to getting the games to our backers whatever difficulties arise in the next few months.\n\nThe 10th Anniversary boss boxes are considerably more complex. We've set the shipping date on those for Christmas, but our experience with these types of projects on Thornwatch, Tak, and Apocrypha leads us to be careful about specific dates, given some instability in the supply channel now. We are planning to ship these editions separately from the games themselves, so if you pledge for a Boss Bundle, you'll get your games and books at the same time everyone else does. We'll keep you in the know as the Boss Bundle is developed.

Never have an itchy or irritated butthole again from improper cleaning with toilet paper.  \nYes there\u2019s other bidet attachements out there, but we spent hundreds of hours watering our butts to fine tune the angle, stream and pressure of the Narsehole for your tender areas.   \nIf Your Butt Could Talk -  \u201dImagine a life where im never irritated. You rarely see me, but you can feel me when I\u2019m upset.  Please start using water, it\u2019ll make me happy and when I\u2019m happy, you\u2019re happy.\u201d \n How does Narsehole connect? It attaches in-between the seat and bowl and connects to the fresh water supply coming out of the wall via an included hose splitter.\n\n Perfect for any occasion: You can activate the individual nozzles for the starfish or the clam, or both nozzle sprays at the same time for the dreaded diarrhea days. This will take care of your whole butt and restart you back in the game of life as if nothing was ever wrong in the first place. Side note - thought about what you wanna get your grandparents for Christmas this year? (wink)\nWhat\u2019s the \u201cClam\u201d for? If you happen to find yourself in ownership of a vagina on your frontside\u2026set the directional knob to the \u201cClam\u201d, turn the water on low:) Water is an effective way to remove bacteria and prevent UTIs. \nWhat is the temperature of the water? It\u2019s cool/room temperature water. It\u2019s kinda like splashing your face with water in the morning...a nice little wake me up :) \n How do I poop with the Narsehole? Poop, play on your phone for a while to make sure it\u2019s all out, turn the direction knob to the \u201cstarfish\u201d and the water pressure knob to desired spray, turn water off, pat dry with a few squares of toilet paper or hand towel, and you\u2019re done. \n What types of toilets can Narsehole attach to? Almost any toilet. Everything is included in the box to connect to the common household toilet.\nDoes the Narsehole require electricity? Nope. It\u2019s powered entirely by your fresh water supply. That means if your power goes out you can still clean your butt! \nNEW - Two Handle Options!\n Spray Nirvana: The Narsehole has a spray stream with separate nozzles and pressure controls for both the starfish and the clam. Trust us, all sprays are not created equal, we spent hundreds of research hours watering our butts to fine tune the Narsehole\u2019s stream in order to take the best possible care of your tender areas! Wanna roll the dice and save five bucks on Amazon? You\u2019re risking getting either a small and pointy spray (ouchie!) or the super soaker that gets your entire bathing suit region wet (might as well just hop in the shower).\nPLAY\n\nNo More Wiping Yourself Raw!\nNo More Dingleberries!\nNo More Aggravating Your Hemorrhoids Before the DMB Concert!\n\nWould you use toilet paper if you pooped out your belly button?  No? then why is it good enough for your butt? \n Toilet paper is a 38 billion and 10 million tree a year industry in the U.S. Save money, the environment and your butt. \nDay of the Nareshole Shoot\nWe\u2019re four dudes that used water to clean our butts for the first time in our mid 30\u2019s. It was amazing, faster, more efficient and it left us feeling clean and fresh! We were shocked. \nOur goal -  Is to red pill everyone on water over toilet paper and to make sure their first experience is with a spray that\u2019s gentle but firm, if they need it to be.  \nBelow is our estimate for standard shipping charges, with $5 \u2013 $20 decuted (Nareshole\u2019s covering percentage of shipping to keep the cost down) Because this estimate is based on our expected volume for this campaign, it could be subject to change depending on the final result. These charges may also change if you add additional products during the survey process. We want to keep this process as simple and accurate as possible, while avoiding any false promise or unexpected charges.\nCustoms, Duty, and VAT charges: In some cases, international backers outside of the USA will be required to pay additional customs, duty, and/or VAT charges. We cannot control this additional charge, and it will be the backers responsibility to cover once they receive the selected reward. Any questions regarding this additional charge should be addressed directly with the backers customs office.\nQ&A\n1. How does Narsehole connect? It attaches in-between the seat and bowl and connects to the fresh water supply coming out of the wall via an included hose splitter.\n2. What types of toilets can Narsehole attach to? Almost any toilet. Everything is included in the box to connect to the common household toilet.\n3. How do I use the Narsehole? Poop, play on your phone for a while to make sure it\u2019s all out, turn the direction knob to the \u201cstarfish\u201d and the water pressure knob to desired spray, go back to playing on your phone while moving your butt around a little bit to be thorough, turn water off, pat dry with a few squares of toilet paper or hand towel, and you\u2019re done.\n4. Is it sanitary for multiple people to use the same Narsehole? Yes. Narsehole is designed to be clean and hygienic with a self-cleaning, auto-retracting nozzle and full-length nozzle guard. i.e. it\u2019s a million times more sanitary then using toilet paper.\n5. What\u2019s the \u201cClam\u201d for? If you happen to find yourself in ownership of a vagina on your frontside\u2026set the directional knob to the \u201cClam\u201d, turn the water on low:) Water is an effective way to remove bacteria and prevent UTIs.\n6. Does the Narsehole require electricity? Nope. It\u2019s powered entirely by your fresh water supply. This also makes it easier to install.\n7. What is the temperature of the water? It\u2019s cool/room temperature water. It\u2019s kinda like splashing your face with water in the morning...a nice little wake me up :)\n8. What\u2019s the difference between the Narsehole and the less expensive options on Amazon?  The cheaper ones have one nozzle (not worth your time) and 90% of dual nozzles are $70-$150.  We tested all the (direct from China) Amazon models and the truth is, you get what you pay for \u2014 if you\u2019re used to boxed wine, you\u2019ll still think it\u2019s good \u2014 but the Narsehole is for people who like that fine wine! We\u2019re not judging, but ask yourself, which person are you?\nDesign/Prototype - Our main focus on design was finding the perfect spray for both the starfish and clam.

We did some searches, and we found an article on a website that suggested some solutions to improve the gaming experience with professional tables, in this way, we came across an amateur project that inspired us to develop AdapTableTop \"ATT\". We intended to make a device that had the same concept but could be more versatile. \nSince that, several products have been released on the market that allows users to improve the gaming experience, from professional wooden tables to additional accessories, and they are all good solutions. With our project, we wanted to focus on the features that we believe are fundamental to our experience as players and developers to offer a product that can help many other players to have fewer limitations due to their playable space. These are the key points on which we have worked: more surface, customizable, stable, easy to use, and transport.\n\nWe faced many problems during the development of the project. We managed to fix them and we are happy to have inserted all the features that we consider essential and unique to ensure everyone can enjoy their boardgames and RPGs in the best possible way and, above all, in any circumstance.\nThe honeycomb under the \"ATT\" modules allows the legs and stabilizers to interlock in any position. So we asked ourselves: why not make the technical data of the joints \"open source\" so that anyone can personalize his AdapTableTop with any 3D printer? And so we did! Together with any bundle, we will send to you as a Kickstarter exclusive, a file with the technical data of the honeycomb system. Gamestart will also unlock during the campaign a series of \"ready to print\" accessories. The \".stl\" file (compatible with any 3D printer software) will be downloadable during the post-campaign phase.\nHow would you like to customize your AdapTableTop?\n\nThe first feature we focused on is the ease of assembling and disassembling \"ATT\", without using metal parts or screws to ensure the safety of younger children and giving the product the best flexibility of use without having to spend too much time in the setup.\nYou no longer have to adapt to the space available to play. Now you can create a new surface and choose to mount each leg and each \"ATT\" module wherever you prefer, according to your needs. You can also decide to split it or to use only one of the six available modules to make it suitable for even the smallest tables. Each module is 30 x 30cm (11,8 x 11,8 inch).\nWith \"ATT\" you can change the legs height during the assembly phase: you can choose between 8 and 12 cm (3,1 and 4,7 inch). If we had not entered this feature, Some of the players would have had visual problems and then be forced to get up often to understand what to do during the game session. We don't want your favorite game to be stressful too. You can use the different heights of \"ATT\" to create environments with different levels in a wargame or RPG scenario.\nReliable, stable and monolithic: 3 features to prevent the gaming experience from being ruined by an accidental gesture. The interlocking method we have chosen consists in the use of legs equipped with four pins each; they block the planks and ensure the stability of the structure. The legs can be inserted anywhere thanks to the lower part of the table made up of a continuous beehive grid. The shape difference between table hexagonal hollow area and the four-round pins of each leg allows stability and rapidity in assembly. It is undoubtedly better to invest more time in playing than to waste time assembling a device, risking to make this phase boring.\nThe thickness of the top ABS plastic allows the table to maintain up to 9kg of material on it and to guarantee this weight, our crash test reached 12kg.\nYou can play any game or wargame with metal scenery, but we do not recommend playing Twister!\nPrototype: standard edition - black color\nStability, in any situation: is the essential point. It was not enough for us that, during use, it was monolithic but we wanted it to be like this even on the move, with your games or puzzles on it and with the certainty of not having any problem. How many of you happened to have to move while you were playing or doing a puzzle? You can do it without any problem and no risk. Thanks to the \"DYNAMIC STABILITY ADAPTERS\" to be inserted under the modules, any accidental release is prevented, bringing \"ATT\" to a higher standard of stability.\n\"ATT\" is a multi-surface solution that can also be used outside the playful context, thanks to its complete modularity. Do you, therefore, want a color matching your decor? It will be possible to choose from more than one color and we managed to insert six! Glossy Silver is the primary color. Gold, red, blue, black, and green are the five exclusive Kickstarter colors with a matt finish.\nIt will be available with a rigid and compact case to facilitate its transport when you go to use it outside your home. \nCreate two separate zones with AdapTableTop to take advantage of each type of game.\nDecide how many parts of AdapTableTop you want to use and adapt your legs to get a view of the whole table when you need it.\nUse the zone below \"ATT\" for all games with a large play area.\nCreate multiple height levels to enhance your role-playing adventures.\nYour favorite game in the best conditions to be played.\nThe new area formed in \"ATT\" can be used as a favorite. Place the Legs where you feel most comfortable. You can do it.\nNow you will no longer have problems placing meeples, miniatures or a snack.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nWrite your preference in the comments (UPDATE 11)!!!\nWrite your preference in the comments (UPDATE 19)!!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This project is promoted by Green Inbox\nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox\n\"More than $25,000,000 has been raised with Sprint's support\"", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 6th Kickstarter campaign, previous projects have been supported and delivered successfully or are about to be delivered.\nWe believe that constantly informing and supporting our backers in every phase of the project (presentation - production - shipping - customer support) is the best form of respect.\nThis is our philosophy.\n\nAware that there may be delays that do not depend on us but on production in China or the customs, we considered delivery time by Christmas 2020.

Expand your network with railways, highways and stations to collect points, but you will be penalised for any open connections, so plan carefully!\nA game of Railroad Ink Challenge is played over 7 rounds. The goal is to connect as many Exits to each other as possible by drawing Routes that can create Networks. The more Exits you connect to the same Network, the more points it will be worth. Bonus points can be earned for your Longest Railway, your Longest Highway, and by drawing on the Central Spaces of your Board.\nRoll the dice!\nDraw the routes!\nConnect the exits!\nFurther bonus points can be obtained by achieving the all-new Goals, but beware: the players who achieve them faster get greater rewards, so you\u2019ll have to keep an eye on what your opponents are doing and try to complete the Goals before they do. A different set of Goals will be available each time, so no game will be the same.\nBut wait, there\u2019s more! Draw unprecedented, mind-bending route configurations thanks to the new dice! Connect special structures to your network to trigger new effects: factories allow you to duplicate a die, villages give bonus points if they are close to a station, universities unlock extra special routes... use these effects wisely and you\u2019ll score big!\nThere are even new expansions!

This should make the production process quick and straightforward. However, when you produce anything in China, unexpected events may always lead to delays with production, shipping or customs.

We will be updating you on a regular basis and we will be present during the whole process to answer any questions and read every comment.\n\nThe estimated delivery date of Railroad Ink Challenge is December 2020, but keep in mind this is only an estimate.

We have asked several  designers like you to propose us something, so whomever designs the best  one is hired!\"\nMinigolf Designer is a competitive free form puzzle board game for 1 to 5 players that plays in 60 to 90 minutes (around 20 minutes per players).\nAn example of Hole made out of tiles\nIn Minigolf Designer, players will compete to collect tiles representing sections of mini golf holes, and arrange them the way they want to form a 9 holes miniature golf course. However, in the end the players will gain more or less victory points depending on certain aspects of their mini golf course, and also depending on the number of people drawn on their mini golf layout.\nOne of the three Rulers used to present the tiles and hold the turn order\nTiles are proposed to the players ordered from the least to the most valuable tile (depending on the number of victory points that the tile provides), but this order becomes also the player's next turn order.\nThe game is simple and plays fast, as players do only one thing during their turn: pick a tile and place it on their mini golf design. After placing around 40 tiles, their mini golf course is complete and players can score them to declare the winner.\nExample of a complete mini golf course that a player can create during the game\nMinigolf Designer delivers a quite new player experience to board game lovers, mostly due to its free form aspect. The fact that you can create any design gives this feeling of freedom. You can actually play just by following your artistic creativity!\nBut it's not a purely artistic random placement of pieces either. The puzzle aspect comes from the challenge to assemble the tiles in a way that satisfies a bunch of preferences. However, there is no unique solution; with the 256 tiles present in the box, you can build millions of miniature golf courses!\nCompetitive players will also enjoy the game by trying to satisfy as much design constraints as they can, if not all (which is possible). There are 7 design aspects that could give you victory points, but none of them are mandatory. Therefore, both kids, casual players and competitive players can enjoy the game but in different ways.\n\"I personally like to play minigolf, and I always enjoy to discover the various obstacles every time I try a new minigolf. This was the triggering idea for this game. I thought the guys who design real miniature golf courses may have a lot of fun just to invent new obstacles and try to fit all the holes on the available space, in a logical manner. So I designed my game around this idea, and now we can all experience the same fun.\" - Alban Nanty (designer of this game)\nSince this is our first publication, we do not have a network of retailers to get Minigolf Designer to a wider audience, which means this may be your best chance to get the game!\nPlease note that the final appearance of the game components may differ from the images above.\nThe mini golf tiles are 4 cm (1.6 inches) wide. The cards are in poker format (around 6 x 9 cm i.e. 3.54 x 2.36 inches). The game box will be 29.7 x 29.7 x 9 cm (11.7 x 11.7 x 3.54 inches). The estimated weight of the box is 2.150 Kg (4.7 pounds) (with complete punch boards).\nHere is a video where Alban presents the game components (in their prototype version) while explaining the rules:\nAs you can see the turn is very fast. Players will need between 36 to 40 tiles to complete their design, which means the players will play around 40 turns before the end of the game.\nThe tiles are presented to the players on a ruler (with one more tile than the number of players), but they are sorted according to their number printed on the back. When a player pick a tile, she leaves her pawn at the same place. The order of the pawns on the ruler becomes the next turn order.\nTherefore, the more victory points the tile you pick has, the more likely you will play last in the next turn, leaving you with less choice in the next turn. On the contrary, if you pick a boring tile, or even if you pass in front of everyone, you will be the first player to choose a tile in the next turn.\nFamily Version\nThe above explanation is the basic mode, suitable for kids, family and casual players. This is probably the version you will play for the first time, to get familiarized with the game.\nAdvanced Version\nThe game also comes with extra wooden disks and cards, to play a more competitive version of the game. In this version, the players follow the exact same rules as the family version, but at the beginning of the game (and later during the game), players will have a chance to bet secretly on which aspect of their mini golf design they will more focus on. At the end of the game, the players can gain extra victory points, if they are actually better than the other players for the aspect(s) that they chose. However, this is risky, because if they are not the best, they will lose points.\nSolo mode\nThe rule book contains also some rule adaptations to play solo. In solo mode, the player don't need the Rulers, but still draw 2 tiles during each turn, for choosing one. They can pass, meaning not choosing one of the two tiles, but that makes them lose victory points.\nWatch a tutorial for a three players game, in advanced mode by JonGetsGames (in English):\nWatch a rule explanation while playing a two players game in family mode by Slickerdrips (in English):\nWatch a rule explanation while playing a two players game in advance mode by jPlay (in English):\nWatch a full game with three players (in English): \nWatch a full game with two players (in English): \nWatch a solo game (in Spanish):\nHere are the first impressions of  Slickerdrips (in English):\nOne Board Family has written a review of our game, you can click on the image below to read it:\n\nHere is a full game for 3 players played by JonGetsGames (in English):\nFor non English speaking videos, you can always click on the CC button to activate the subtitles, then click on the Gear icon and choose Subtitles/CC > Auto-translate > English, in order to get the subtitle in English (or any other language you like).\nHere is a quick rule explanation and opinion about the game done by The Boardgames Society (in French):\nHere is a review of the game prototype that we sent to the Youtuber Maurice Lapierre. In this video Maurice presents you all the game components and gives his first impression on the game mechanics:\nHere is a complete rule explanation, and game component presentation from the youtuber D\u00e1maso de Damasco y sus distracciones:\nUnlike many other board games whose illustration is made on computer, Minigolf Designer is really a game of art. Its original artwork was all paint by hand by our artist Gul. She painted 170 different tiles in 10 x 10 cm (3.9 x 3.9 inches) format, even if we knew that tiles will be smaller in the game (4 x 4 cm or 1.6 x 1.6 inches).\nExample of the tiles painted by the artist\nWe decided to give away those pieces of art, already framed in a modern and sober frame. If you pledge at the \"The Game + One Original Art Work\" level, you will receive a unique painting already framed and ready to be displayed on your desk. The pieces of art will be randomly distributed to the backers of that pledge level, therefore it will be a surprise to see which tile you received. You can then try to find the tile in the game and maybe even notice some difference if the tile has been edited after scanning.\nAs we only have 170 painted tiles, we had to limit the quantity for this pledge level, so hurry up if you want your original art work!\nAn example of an original painted art work in its frame\nThe above picture is one of the possible tile that you may receive, but each available painting that we give away is different, so the image above is just here to give you an overview of the overall look. The tile that you will get will certainly be different. The frame itself should be the one displayed on the image.\nThe painting size is around 10 x 10 cm (3.9 x 3.9 inches), and the outside frame is a bit less than 15 x 15 cm (5.9 x 5.9 inches).\n\nOn top of the pledged amount, we will also count the likes that you can collectively give us on the social networks. We call these the social pledges. Each social pledge that you give us will be equivalent to HK$ 10. For now we will count those social pledges:\nBecome fan on the BGG page \nLike our Facebook page \nFollow our Twitter account\nShare the Kicktraq page of the project through the share button on this page\nThe counter of Social pledge on June the 18th 2020 is: HK$ 1640\nFor the Land cards Stretch Goal, we thought that it could be a great opportunity to let you leave your little imprint in the game. Even if the stretch goal is reached, you can still participate until the end of the campaign.\nFirstly, let me show you all the Land cards already designed and ready for the game:\nAll the land cards currently designed in the game\nNow, if you are interested, you can propose your own land cards!\nHere are the few constraints that you should follow:\nYou don't need to be an artist for your proposal, basically you just have to draw the grid\nThe land card should contain one, and only one quarter circle tile (whose side equals two tiles)\nThe number of squares/tiles should be between 34 to 38 (excluding river and lake tiles)\nYou don't need to assign victory points to your cards, we will do it according to the difficulty of the cards, and we will balance it with the other cards\nIf you decide to add a river, you should make at least two bridges in order for the player to be able to satisfy the circuit constraint\nAnd here are the rules for the participation:\nThe participation is only opened to backer (at minimum \"The Game\" level).\nYou need to submit your proposal in the form of an image. Post a comment to the project with the link to your image to do your submission.\nNo more than 3 submissions per backer.\nWe may ask you to adjust your submission, or decide to not use it, if the card has some gameplay issues, such as if the layout doesn't fit well on the cards, doesn't allow the player to complete his minigolf course, break the game in any way, etc...\nBy submitting a proposition you automatically authorize Thematic Games to use your proposal to be included and printed in the game.\nIf we have too many submissions, at the end of the campaign we will choose the one we prefer.\nYou can propose land cards until the end of the campaign. Once the campaign is finished, no more submission will be accepted.\nIf there's not enough submission at the end of the campaign, we will create the land cards ourselves. We don't know yet how many land cards we will add for this Stretch Goal, lets see the number of submission that we get first.\nHere are the suggestions we got so far:\nWe run this Kickstarter campaign through our company named Thematic Games. Alban has started up this company in 2015 for the purpose of creating immersive games and entertaining experiences. We believe immersion and story telling is what makes people dream, therefore we always pay attention to the theme of each game we create.\nFor this project we are also helped by Jerome Levy, an Executive Producer in one of the major Video Game companies, who helps us as an adviser for the Kickstarter campaign and the overall aspect of the project.\nFor more info on Gul's creative work, you can visit the Wenlin Studio website.\n (*) European countries concerned by this shipping cost are: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, United Kingdom.

In any case, you will see the shipping cost when you click on a pledge package, depending on your location.\nWe have friendly shipping for Europe (for the listed countries above), USA, Canada, Australia and China. For many other countries, the price of the game is lower than the limit to pay custom fee, so in such case your parcel will be free of additional cost.\nAll shipping cost are paid up-front on Kickstarter.\nThe cost displayed in local currency in between brackets are just estimates, depending on the currency exchange rates at the time this page was created.

It was amazing, faster, more efficient and it left us feeling clean and fresh! We were shocked and felt lied to our entire lives. Wondering why all of our heads were filled with the same false narratives \u2014 they\u2019re some strange French thing only women use, the butt of a foot cleaning joke from a movie or that they\u2019re big, bulky and an entirely separate unit from your toilet. \nAfter a month of using water to clean our butts our lives were better off \u2014 no more swampy butts, no more dingleberries, no more sore butthole days from wiping over and over again. We became filled with a righteous indignation to try to tell others/red pill all the toilet paper users out there.  \nOur goal was simple - Create the most simplistic, non-electric, water powered, easiest to install butt-shower ever! Then pair that with the most badass marketing plan designed to breakdown the walls erected by society, cute bears and big TP business!!  \nI know this takes some trust, we were you once too, but now we\u2019re your future you, and your future you is telling you to take the leap of faith...we all know in our hearts that water is better at cleaning than paper. Close your eyes, listen to your clean, itch free future butt whispering \u201cback this project, take care of your old friend downstairs, I know you rarely see me, but you can feel me when I\u2019m upset. This decision will make me happy for the rest of my life and when I\u2019m happy, you\u2019re happy.\u201d   \n\nQ&A\n1. How does Narsehole connect? It attaches in-between the seat and bowl and connects to the fresh water supply coming out of the wall via an included hose splitter. \n2. What types of toilets can Narsehole attach to? Almost any toilet. Everything is included in the box to connect to the common household toilet. \n3. How do I use the Narsehole? Poop, play on your phone for a while to make sure it\u2019s all out, turn the direction knob to the \u201cstarfish\u201d and the water pressure knob to desired spray, go back to playing on your phone while moving your butt around a little bit to be thorough, turn water off, pat dry with a few squares of toilet paper or hand towel, and you\u2019re done. \n4. Is it sanitary for multiple people to use the same Narsehole? Yes. Narsehole is designed to be clean and hygienic with a self-cleaning, auto-retracting nozzle and full-length nozzle guard. i.e. it\u2019s a million times more sanitary then using toilet paper. \n 5. What\u2019s the \u201cClam\u201d for? If you happen to find yourself in ownership of a vagina on your frontside\u2026set the directional knob to the \u201cClam\u201d, turn the water on low:) Water is an effective way to remove bacteria and prevent UTIs. \n6. Does the Narsehole require electricity? Nope. It\u2019s powered entirely by your fresh water supply. This also makes it easier to install. \n7. What is the temperature of the water? It\u2019s cool/room temperature water. It\u2019s kinda like splashing your face with water in the morning...a nice little wake me up:)\n8. What\u2019s the difference between the Narsehole and the less expensive options on Amazon?  \nFast Facts: the cheaper ones have one nozzle (not worth your time) and 90% of dual nozzles are $70-$150.\nNot convinced yet? Here\u2019s the deal: We tested all the (direct from china) Amazon models and the truth is, you get what you pay for \u2014 if you\u2019re used to boxed wine, you\u2019ll still think it\u2019s good \u2014 but the Narsehole is for people who like that fine wine! We\u2019re not judging, but ask yourself, which person are you?  \nWhy the Narsehole is the fine wine of butt showers:\n1 - Spray Nirvana: The Narsehole has a perfect spray stream with separate nozzles and pressure controls for both the starfish and the clam. Trust us, all sprays are not created equal, we spent hundreds of research hours watering our butts to fine tune the Narsehole\u2019s stream in order to take the best possible care of your tender areas! Wanna roll the dice and save five bucks on Amazon? You\u2019re risking getting either a small and pointy spray (ouchie!) or the super soaker that gets your entire bathing suit region wet (might as well just hop in the shower).\n2 - Double Trouble: You can activate both nozzle sprays at the same time for the dreaded diarrhea days. This will take care of your whole butt and restart you back in the game of life as if nothing was ever wrong in the first place. Side note - thought about what you wanna get your grandparents for Christmas this year? (wink)\n3 - The Blessing of the Vikings: To put it simply, the Narsehole is way more fun than any other tiny butt shower out there. With the Narsehole attached to your porcelain throne, you\u2019ve got one hell of a conversation starter and you\u2019ll have a great follow up anecdote about the Vikings putting their butts over the side of their boats! Bonus round, if you know how to play the guitar you can serenade them with the theme song too \ud83d\ude42! Ain\u2019t no party like a Narsehole party, cause a Narsehole party has clean butts.\nDesign / Prototype - Our main focus on design was finding the perfect spray for both the starfish and clam.  Testing 100\u2019s of different angles and hole patterns, we finally found the perfect spray and are excited to bring it to a butt near you coming this July:)!!\nInitial Design Sketch\nDesign Process & Progression of Nozzles\nPrototyping Nozzles for Perfect Spray", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe supplier has been established, vetted, and final samples have been tested and approved.

However, we appreciate greatly if you can indicate what you are interested in by adding the cost for the add-ons to your pledge or selecting one of the predefined reward tiers.\nYour job as Curator is to expand the museum and its collection. With help from your employees you will build new wings and collect objects to put on display in the museum.\nMuseum expanding with new wings, objects and visitors.\nThe employees are represented by five chips that are used to determine what different actions you may take in the game. Select your action from the face up chips, flip the chip over to show you have used it. This will reveal a different action on the other side which you can use at a later time. \nSelecting the archaeologist's action, leaves you without it on the next turn\nOn the other hand, if you ever have two of the same action available on your turn you may choose to double up. This means that on a single turn you can flip two chips and do double the amount of work. \nYou can flip two chips with identical symbols to do a double action!\nDuring play you acquire loan contracts for famous objects, like 'the dice tower of a Roman soldier' or 'the skull of the neanderthal man', from other museums. To score the points for these objects you need to complete a tetris like puzzle of color and space matching.\nWhen you have build the shape and filled it, the contract is completed.\nWhen the game ends only one museum will stand as the victor and take home the 'Museum of the Year Award'.\nShipping details and costs for the project will be handled in the pledge manager after the project ends. Refer to the table below for our estimated shipping costs.\nWe offer local pickup from our partner stores. Currently we partner with the following stores, but we are reaching out to more stores so we will keep updating this list.\n\nThis project is US, EU, Canada & Australia friendly, this means you won't have to worry about customs if you live in any of these regions, we will ship from within your region.\nBecause of irregular mail delivery we do not ship to the following countries: Russia, Syria, Afghanistan, Ukraine, Khazakstan, Yemen, Saudi Arabia & North Korea.\nCurrently there is a lot of uncertainty in the world. Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic have created a situation where it is impossible to tell what the future will hold. This affects everyone in different ways and, of course, it will affect this project as well. \nFor this campaign we have added more time to our delivery date as we may need room if manufacturing is delayed by some unforeseen event. \nAs for Brexit we will try our best to make sure that backers can avoid unnecessary customs charges. However due to things that are out of our control, there is a slight risk that the current rules may change in an unfavorable way, that could lead to increased costs for UK backers. We are monitoring this situation and will make sure to keep backers informed about any changes.\nHow has it been working on Curators? \nIts has been a blast! The game really took off when Pablo and Tove introduced tetris-shaped tiles and the secret contracts. Since then there have been some small but important changes that we all contributed to.\nWhat part of Curators are you most proud of? \nThe action selection mechanic feels fresh and encourages you to plan ahead, but doesn't necessarily punish you for not doing it. Making the game suitable for both casual players and those who really like to play strategically.\nTell us more about why you want to create board games?\nCreating games has been a great way for me to find a creative outlet. Doing it together with fantastic individuals like the Curators team makes the experience even more fun!\nWhat makes Curators a great game?\nI think the way we have connected mechanics, story and art to the game play is strong, this makes Curators a great gateway+ game.\nHow has it been working on Curators?\nIt has been an exciting adventure and I have learned so much. It has been fun to see the game evolve from some simple hand sketches to a finished professional product. It has also been fun to work together with such talented people.\nWhat makes Curators a great game?\nI love optimizing the flipping mechanic and the mental puzzle of the game the most.\nHow has it been working on Curators? \nIt's been great to work with Worldshapers on the project! It was a fun challenge to work on the project because the theme was not as whimsical as my usual stuff.\nWhat was it like developing the art for the components?\nAs components in board games are quite small it was challenging to make everything read well from an art perspective. I think the final result came out really well and I'm looking forward to seeing the game in print.\nHow has it been working on Curators? \nIt was both really fun and challenging! Working with Worldshapers has really pushed me out of my comfort zone and made me learn a lot about about my own creative process.\nWhat was the most fun thing about developing the cover?\nThe best part of working with the cover was to experiment with new ways for me to render it nicely. I had a great time figuring out how to approach the piece!\n How has it been working on Curators? \nWorking on Curators has been a great experience. Since it was my first larger project, I finally got to put all I've learned about graphic design to good use.\nWhat was the most fun part of developing the rule book?\nThe most fun part of developing the rule book was noticing how well it worked during the test sessions. Seeing something you've made being used, understood and even praised by others is a powerful experience. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have previously released other games so we know what we are doing. That beings said there are always risks with any project. \n\nWhen you back one of our projects, you are placing your trust in us and, therefore, we want to be as transparent as possible with what risks you take in doing so.\n\nUNCERTAIN WORLD\n\nCurrently there is a lot of uncertainty in the world. During the year both Brexit and the Corona pandemic have created a situation where it is impossible to tell what the future will hold. This affects every one in different ways and of course it will affect this project as well. \n\nFor this campaign the current uncertainty means we have added more time to our delivery date as we may need room if manufacturing is delayed due to the outbreak. \n\nAs for Brexit we will try our best to make sure that games sent to UK backers will be sent from within the UK. However due to things that are out of our control, there is a risk that games will be shipped from the EU. In this case UK backers will need to be aware that they may have to pay additional postage or tax to be able to pick up their games. If this happens we will of course inform you before sending any games.\n\nPRODUCTION RISKS\n\nWe will do our best to ensure a high quality product. However some things are out of our control.\n\nIn printing, there is always a risk of items differing from what was initially intended. This means that some items might not look exactly as displayed above. If you are not satisfied with your product let us know why and we will handle it on a case by case basis. \n\nMISSING OR DAMAGED ITEMS\n\nWhen creating a game with multiple pieces, there is always the risk that some pieces go missing. If, after you receive your order, you find that there are items missing or something is damaged, let us know.\n\nIf the game arrives damaged, please take a few photos and send them our way.\n\nDELIVERY\n\nOur current plan for delivery is April 2021. We want your order to be delivered in time, but bad stuff can happen and even the best plans get delayed. Manufacturer errors, weather conditions, and custom hold ups are a few reasons a delay could happen. If this happens you can trust that we will let you know what is going on and how it affects your delivery.\n\nDELIVERY ADDRESS\n\nWhen this campaign is over, we will request you to complete a survey in which you can select where you would like us to ship your order. As the shipping date is not set in stone, please give us an address that will not change in the months around delivery. (For instance if you are moving, send the package to a friend or a relative's address instead.)\n\nIf you live at a military base, it is sometimes complicated to send packages to your location. Make sure to provide an address where the package can be shipped.\n\nIf a package is not delivered and the guidelines above have not been followed or if the wrong address has been given to us by a backer, the backer may have to pay any extra shipping cost if they want to receive their rewards.\n\nBY PLEDGING TO THIS CAMPAIGN, YOU ATTEST THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND ACCEPTED THE RISKS STATED IN THIS SECTION.\n\nWe hope you understand that, Worldshapers, will do our best to mitigate the risks mentioned above. If something unfortunate happens, please bear with us and be patient. We will do our best to sort it out.\n\nThank you,\nWorldshapers\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nWe design our games to be fun and usable for a long time, this means we take replayability seriously. All our games are created with the intent of having them played as much as possible.\nReusability and recyclability\nWe try to minimize our use of non recyclable materials. For the components of this product we are using exclusively cardboard and paper.\nSustainable materials\nWe always try to minimize our use of plastic, in favor of paper, in our products. \n\nFor this product we have talked to our manufacturing team and we will hopefully be trying a new packing technique that should allow us to remove external shrinkwrapping of our games. This means the only plastic in the game will be the wrapping for the playing cards and zip lock bags.\n\nApart from the above all the paper & cardboard in the product will come from certified sustainable forestry. This means we are effectively replanting almost 70 trees.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nWhen choosing a factory we consider quality and durability, shipping distance and what certifications our manufacturers have as well as price. It's important for us that our manufacturers strive to get better and we try our best to push them in the right direction. The manufacturer we have chosen for Curators uses the SEDEX framework to evaluate their supply chain, which means we trust that they are managing theirs responsibly.\nSustainable Distribution\nWe will try to optimize our shipping routes by sending games directly from the factory to fulfillment centers. We also provide several pickup locations, to reduce last mile emissions during delivery. \n\nFor games that we deliver on our own we will use recycled paper as much as possible.\n\nFor this product we will be CO2 compensating for the emissions created by our transportation of the product, by replanting trees.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge SEK 10 or more", "title": "Retail pledge.", "descp": "> approximately $1 <\nPledge to show interest in the final product.

All texts are in English.\n\nPRODUCTION RISKS\nItems and colors shown in this campaign might differ in the final product due to supplier/manufacturer error. In addition, the production may get delayed due to various reasons. Supplier shortage, holiday traffic and weather conditions are just a few of examples. Artipia Games should not be held responsible for delays caused by third parties. We will do everything in our power to deliver you the best possible product as soon as possible.\n\nMISSING / DAMAGED ITEMS\nIf after receiving your whole order, there are missing/damaged items please inform us by sending us a Kickstarter message or an email at support[at]artipiagames.com including some photos of what was damaged. We will send you replacements for the missing/damaged items as soon as possible.\n\nUNDELIVERED ITEMS\nWe will re-send any packages returned to us undelivered after we will inform the backer. If a package was not delivered due to a backer's fault (wrong address given, backer didn't claim the delivered package from their post office, etc), we may request additional shipping fees to re-send the package.\n\nDELIVERY DATE\nWe are happy to inform you that we have chosen to include tracked shipping in this campaign, in order to reduce possible shipping problems with packages being delayed or lost. Estimated delivery is December 2020. However third parties involved with the production of items needed to fulfill the campaign may cause unpredictable delays. After shipping the packages, further delays may occur due to your local customs and postal services traffic that are out of Artipia's control. Please note that delivery dates that involve shipping refer to the month we expect to dispatch the items.\n\nDELIVERY ADDRESS\nAfter the campaign is over you will be requested to complete a survey and a pledge manager including your shipping address. Please provide us with a shipping address that will be valid around December 2020. If after filling the survey and pledge manager you wish to alter your shipping address, please send us a Kickstarter message.\n\nORDER FULFILLMENT\nA while after the campaign ends you will get access to our pledge manager. Your order will get fulfilled only if you have completed the pledge manager before campaign fulfillment. Please note that due to weight limitations in the shipping methods we use, your order may be delivered in multiple packages. Even though all of your packages most probably will get shipped at the same time, there is always a chance they will arrive to you several days apart. This may occur due to each country's postal service sort-and-dispatch system.\n\nREFUNDS\nWe generally do not offer refunds unless we are unable to deliver the project. We will not offer refunds because of delays in delivery or changes/adjustments to the game's components, layout etc. or for damaged components that we are able to replace.

We've made a simple solution!\nBoard Game Clips holding together Formula D\nHave you ever been playing your favorite multi-board board game and someone knocks one of the boards out of place? Or you just can't get them lined up perfectly during setup? This can be extremely frustrating! These little clips will solve these issues and are designed specifically for board games! \n  How Board Game Clips Work\nBoard Game Clips are a simple, affordable solution to a simple issue.\nThey will snugly and temporarily clip together two boards or keep seams in boards closed with very minimal intrusion into the play surface and without noticeably marking or scuffing your board.\nBoard Game Clip helping to keep Terraforming Mars board completely flush!\n \n        These fit nearly all board games such as Cyclades, Formula D, Zombicide, War of the Ring; Or any other board with thickness from 1.75mm to 2.5mm. These have rounded edges so they won't scratch your boards and are created with a continuous bead of 3d printed filament on each layer so that they are very durable and will hold their shape and tension for many hundreds or thousands of clips and unclips. I will also ship an extra clip with each order just in case one does break!\nOur clips have been engineered to remain usable for thousands of clips and un-clips! PLA plastic is created from corn, cassava, sugarcane or sugar beet pulp.\n \n        While not quite big or strong enough to straighten badly warped boards, these will solve the issue of slightly warped boards! Simply put them at the seams of the boards to keep things flatter!\n  Rewards and Add-ons\n Base Pledge Levels \nThere are 3 base pledge levels:  Personal, Large, and Collection.  Early in the campaign, I realized this product was very popular and I found a way to provide less expensive shipping to much of the world so I created the OUTSIDE USA pledge levels for international backers, please use those if you are not in the USA.  All of the pledge levels include an equal number of the two standard variations of straight 2mm clips.\nBoard Game Clips helping a slightly warped Twilight Struggle board and keeping together War of the Ring! Also a shot of 8 clips you will get with a personal size order.\nThe narrow variation have a little more \"bite\" in their grip and don't intrude into the playing surface quite as much, the wider version won't squeeze your board quite as tightly but has a larger compression area, both provide roughly the same result and I find myself using both equally in different situations.  These clips are made for boards 1.8mm - 2.7mm thick and work great for nearly all games!\n    Add-ons\nStraight 2mm clips won't work for every game or in every situation obviously, so we have also developed some additional \"special\" clips which are available by over-pledging (adding additional money to your base pledge).  At the end of the Kickstarter campaign, I will be emailing everyone a backer survey where I will ask how many of each type of additional clip you over-pledged for.  Below is the cost of adding special clips to your order.  The cost per clip varies based on which pledge level you backed.\nIf you want to purchase any of these special clips, please follow the below instructions:\n1- Use the chart below to determine how much additional money to add to your pledge.\n2- Update your pledge to include this additional amount.\n3- When the campaign ends I will send everyone a reward survey, this will include questions asking how many (and what type of) special clips you purchased.  Please answer these and we will send out the correct amounts to you!  You can ask to receive any of the special clips in any combination you choose.\nBelow are descriptions of all of the special clips available for addition to your pledge.  All of these clips have been designed with the same principles in mind of functionality, durability, ease of use, flexible application, and leaving as little impact on your boards as possible!\n    90\u00b0 Corner Clip\n90\u00b0 Corner Clip holding together Game of Thrones the board game and it's expansion pieces.\nBy far the most requested special clip has been corner clips.  As you can see in the picture above from \"A game of Thrones\" these clips will come in handy in MANY different situations, it's so nice to have things stay put and look cohesive throughout the entire play session!  These clips will work for boards of 1.75mm - 2.25mm which covers almost anything you can throw at them!\n    120\u00b0 Hex Tile Clip  (2.5mm)\nOne of the hottest new games out right now is \"Rallyman GT\" it's a great game but wow are those hex tiles difficult to play on!  I've created these 120 degree clips specifically for this purpose!  Any other game that uses hexagonal tiles with 2.25mm- 2.75mm thickness will work great with this also, if you have another game in mind please let me know, I would love to hear about it!\n120\u00b0 clips holding together Rallyman GT!\n    3mm Straight Clip\nWith all the high-level productions being put out by publishers lately, many games are coming with dual-layered boards, most of these dual-layered boards are 3mm thick in total, these clips will hold these together and keep things in place.  These will work on any board from 2.8mm - 3.25mm thick.  I've heard from a backer that Barrage could benefit from these.\nTesting the 3mm straight clips on a typical dual-layered board.\n    1.5mm Straight Clip\nSome games just don't measure up!  Ok... maybe that's harsh, but plenty of great games have slightly thinner than \"standard\" boards.  Any board that is 1.35mm-1.8mm will probably benefit greatly from these clips, as these are the types of boards that warp easiest.\n    120\u00b0 Hex Tile Clip  (2mm)\nSame as the 120\u00b0 2.5mm clips, but for games that use hex tiles that are 2mm in thickness.  I don't have any examples but I'm assuming they exist!  =)\nBelow is a segment from \"Crowdsurfing\" on The Dice Tower; I sent Tom our clips and the guys discuss the product and the campaign.\n A Sample of Games and Which Clips to use:\n  Thank you!\nThank you to everyone who has made this project such a big success and please do not hesitate to ask any questions or voice any concerns you may have.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI foresee no risks in the Kickstarter or fulfillment process.

I wanted to get everyone the latest information on our shipping progress.  \npersonal and large orders outside of the USA are seeing very large delays in some cases.  Many people may notice their package shows as \"delivered\" in the USA, this is simply a sorting facility that the post office uses for our package classification.  After this point, it seems that most packages have been going completely dark with tracking but they are eventually getting delivered.  I spoke with the postmaster at our post office regarding this, he says that he has seen delays of over 3 months in some cases.  This is due to the fact that there are basically no flights from the USA to Europe currently, so there are very few planes for mail and packages to get on to.  They are making their way over, but it is a MUCH slower process than normal and some packages just get physically buried under the backlog of things waiting to get onto overseas transportation for months at a time.  For this reason, I won't be investigating individual international packages for many months to come.  Many people have already contacted me individually with these concerns, I've told them this same information and the package has shown up for them.  So I'm asking international customers to please be patient, your package will more than likely arrive, and if it doesn't, we will address it together later this year.

From the award-winning game designer of Root, Cole Wehrle brings you into an interactive history lesson about life on the edge of empire.  \nIn Pax Pamir, players take the role of Afghan political factions in the early nineteenth century. For generations the Durrani Empire held the region together. Now, their authority has collapsed. Rivals both old and new have emerged from the shadows. It\u2019s up to the players to see if a fledgling Afghan state might come into being.\nThe core of Pax Pamir is simple. Each turn, players will draft cards from a central market and then play those cards. Cards can be used to entrench your position and grant players access to powerful abilities. Throughout the game players will command mighty armies, direct the subterfuge of their spies, and undertake daring political maneuvers.\nPlayers have many tools at their disposal, but the work of forging a new central Asian state is not easy. Players will often need to band together in coalitions. However, only one player will be the winner. As a coalition grows in size, its members will have to fend off internal rivals and secure their own personal dominance.\nPax Pamir takes its subject seriously. The game is the product of over five years of research and draws on a wide range of both primary and secondary sources. For this reason, the game may not be suitable for all groups. It offers an extended meditation on life at the fringes of European power and asks the players to understand the many currents that guided the history of central Asia in the nineteenth century. It is also a deeply interactive game where the path to victory often cuts through the hopes of your opponents. \nFor the first print run of Pax Pamir: Second Edition, Drew and I printed as many copies as we could manage. At that time, we weren't sure if there would be much demand for the game after it's release. The game was a labor of love, and we wanted to focus our efforts on making the best game we possibly could. Neither one of us thought that the game would require a second printing so soon. \nBut the game's sales after its release were strong, and we began to be flooded with requests for a reprint. Because Pamir is an expensive game to produce, we are once again returning to Kickstarter to raise funds for this new printing.\nWe're happy to report that there will be only marginal differences between the second printing and the first. A few small typos on some of the card flavor text have been fixed and a couple of very minor clarifications have been added to the rules. Neither of these changes warrant an upgrade kit for any of the printed components.\nThere will be only one material change. The laser cut ruler tokens proved to be both expensive and hard to decipher, so, for the second printing, we're swapping them with screen printed wooden disks. Anyone who owns the first printing can acquire these by either pledging at the five dollar level or by adding five dollars to either of the other pledge levels. \nWe are also thrilled to be using BackerKit again as our pledge manager. Pledge mangers are third-party services that lets you manage your order leading up to fulfillment. After the campaign ends,  you'll be able to see your unique shipping rate and select any add-ons to your pledge on Backerkit.  \n Anyone who wishes to supplement their pledge with any of the add-ons listed below may add that dollar amount to their pledge or adjust their order in Backerkit after the campaign. \nWe're happy to be working with Backerkit again to help with your KS pledge and process accurate shipping fees. After the campaign, everyone will be emailed by Backerkit so that we can collect your shipping address and process shipping payment for your finalized order. \nThe metal coin add-on contains a cloth bag and 40 single-denomination coins pressed with a period design from the early 19th century (the last struck by the Durrani empire).  Each coin is 25 x 25 x 2mm, small enough to be practical for parsing the market and large enough to have a great feel during play. You can see another picture of the coins here.\nWe have partnered with several experienced international fulfillment companies to help you get your game as soon as possible. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from a partner hub in the US, EU, China, Canada, or Australia.\nThe following is a list of cost estimates for shipping 1 copy of Pax Pamir. Keep in mind these are not finalized yet, and the accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager according to your address after the campaign wraps up. Shipping will vary from country to country and be calculated using both weight and size. In general, the more copies of Pax Pamir you order, the more shipping will cost. Additional copies will add another 30-50% of shipping cost to your order. \nFor folks submitting small orders, like those interested in just metal coins or ruler tokens, shipping will be a fraction of the cost. Depending on your address, most small order shipping will cost less than 50% of the listed rate below. \nIf your game store is interested in a retail order, please submit a Retailer Deposit Pledge and a fill out this form here!  This offer is only available to Brick & Mortar retail stores. Proof of status will be required. Bulk discounts not available for group buys or clubs. \nAll retailers will be required to place a $50 deposit on Kickstarter to get access to our Retailer Backerkit platform. Your $50 pledge will be credited to your retailer order. Note, you must be a verified retailer to have access to this order platform. All unverified Retail Deposit Pledges will revert to the standard pledge.

However, alongside this edition, we have partnered with several established game companies to help produce editions of Pax Pamir in five languages! If you are interested in more information about these translated editions of Pax Pamir, please click the links below.\nAll of our language partners have the ability to offer the metal coins since they are being produced at the same factory.

That means we will offer a full, free print-and-play kit of Pax Pamir: Second Edition for download. Anyone can use, remix, and share the game so long as they do not use it for commercial purposes. \nAt Wehrlegig Games our objective is simple: publish beautiful games with historical themes that treat their subjects and their players seriously. These are games that make arguments and encourage discussion. They don't shy away from difficult subjects.\nBecause we know the audience for such games is limited, in order to make sure we produce games up to our standards we have decided to rely on a direct sales model. The vast majority of all copies produced will be sent to Kickstarter backers. Our games are not designed for traditional distribution or retail channels. This means we can spend many more resources on the game's physical production without having to worry about retail viability.\nOur next project is the second edition of John Company, which we hope to launch on Kickstarter later this year.\nCole Wehrle is a published writer and game designer who currently serves as a staff designer at Leder Games in Saint Paul. Before working in the board game industry, Cole earned his PhD at the University of Texas. His research concerned the ways that the British Empire influenced narrative structure in the nineteenth century novel. He has presented at conferences all over the world and taught classes on a wide range of subjects, from Rhetoric to American Postmodernism. He is perhaps best known for his historical board games (An Infamous Traffic and John Company),for Root, and for his upcoming game Oath.\nDrew Wehrle is the older of Cole's two younger brothers. He has helped Cole develop every game he has ever designed. During the development of the first edition of Pax Pamir, Drew lived with Cole in Austin, Texas and was instrumental in preparing the game for publication. Drew will be handling all of the business and operational elements of Wehrlegig Games, as well as assisting in game development. He previously managed school programs at Chicago Botanic Garden, and as of early 2020, he now helps manage Wehrlegig games full-time. \nThank you to our collaborators: Abol Bahadori for the action icons illustrations, Josh Berer for the box script design, Alex Singh for the wonderful video, Travis Hill for the rulebook support, Ross Connell for the lovely photos, David Carter for the extra customer service, Ben Kyo and AgentElrond for the digital implementations, and all the Backers that help bring our projects to life.

We hope to begin production shortly after the campaign is over. \n\nDrew is now managing this project full-time and will be able to keep an close eye on both the production and fulfillment of the campaign. We have also built a wide network partnerships with folks around the gaming industry, and we have contingencies in place for every element of the project's production and fulfillment.

(Before you answer, remember you are under oath). The original legal pad design hasn\u2019t been revisited since 1888! No wonder it\u2019s the 21st century and the most widely-used writing surface can\u2019t connect to the digital universe and is a doomsday device for trees. \nLegal pad users everywhere should be held in contempt! Until now. The Rocketbook Orbit is an endlessly reusable, customizable, cloud-connected pen and paper notepad.  \nMagnets + Modularity = Magic! The Orbit utilizes customized \u201cPage Packs\u201d that can be removed from the pad! Our new technology uses a magnetic base and has stainless steel rings attached to every pack of Rocketbook pages that can be lifted off the Orbit, flipped 360 degrees, and changed out for a brand new mission.    \nFor your core mission, we\u2019ll equip you with a Page Pack so you can write and sketch at the speed of light, then flip the page for your next objective. A standard lined / dot-grid combo Page Pack is included! But what about other page templates to fulfill all your handwritten needs, like planning the future, conquering your tasks, or writing a fierce space ballad? We\u2019ve got you covered at every phase.\nThe Orbit uses patented Rocketbook reusable pen and paper technology and is forged with a hard plastic composite with a textured synthetic outer layer so the vessel that protects your notes will last for lightyears to come.     \nWhat is your favorite force in the Universe? Ours is magnetism, which is why we designed the world\u2019s first magnetic binding system. Orbit \u201cPage Packs\u201d are bound with ferrous metal rings and stick to a magnetic pad. That also means the entire Orbit happens to stick to your fridge. \nRocketbook\u2019s patented technology means the Rocketbook Orbit is designed for endless reusability. First, use any Pilot FriXion product on your Rocketbook Orbit pages for a traditional handwriting experience. Then, simply use a damp cloth to wipe your pages clean again and again! We\u2019re including a Rocketbook microfiber towel for truly advanced erasing capabilities.   \nDid you know you will consume an entire tree with an average lifetime use of legal pads? Don\u2019t be a weapon of mass tree destruction. It\u2019s not cool for our planet \u2026 not to mention that ordinary, one-use legal pads just don\u2019t look cool. Rocketbook\u2019s mission is to eliminate all the boring and wasteful single-use writing products from the galaxy (don\u2019t believe us? We blogged about it \u2026 so yea, it\u2019s pretty legit).      \nMake no mistake, the Rocketbook Orbit doesn\u2019t only exist in the analog world! First, use your Rocketbook Orbit and Pilot FriXion pen to jot down your notes and big ideas. Then download the free Rocketbook app. When you scan your pages with the app, the space-age machine vision will \u201csee\u201d your handwriting and quickly capture your notes from any angle.      \nThe free Rocketbook app will instantly adjust and visually enhance your notepad scans to ensure the digital version is light years ahead of the real thing.        \nIn the app, you can also assign 7 shortcut symbols to \"destinations\" in the cloud. These destinations can be a folder inside Dropbox, Evernote, Google Docs, an email address, and many other popular services.   \nControl the internet with your pen. Use these 7 shortcut destinations to send your notes, diagrams, and big ideas to the cloud at the speed of light! You can even send to shared folders that your teammates have access to!   \nThe Rocketbook app can even transcribe your handwriting with OCR or \u201cOptical Character Recognition\u201d technology. Transcription allows you to send a digital text version of your notes without ever having to type a single word. OCR also gives you the power to search through all your scans with keywords and phrases. You can even auto-name your files by using the special Smart Title Bar at the top of every Orbit page. Traditional legal pads just can\u2019t keep up! \nSet up the Rocketbook app to instantly beam your notes, diagrams, and big ideas.

The result was the original Morsel, a spoon, fork, and spatula in one awesome utensil. We ended up shipping over 18,000 Morsel Sporks to 5400+ backers.\nNow we're back with Morsel Metal - an ultralight metal and high-temp silicone spork. \nWhy? Because you asked for it.\nWHY METAL?  \nYou gave us the idea!  We heard from countless fans of the original Morsel that we needed to offer a metal option, so we decided to make it happen. After stumbling down a rabbit hole of ultralight metals, we decided that 7075-T6 aluminum was the only choice.\nWe\u2019ve improved on our original design by swapping plastic for hard anodized 7075-T6 aluminum and a fully wrapped high-temp silicone spoon.\nDid we mention it comes in four different flavors?\nChoose from 7.5 inch or 10.5 inch lengths.\nAvailable with our signature silicone spoon, or our ultralight all-metal design.\nOh yeah, we also designed a carrying case made from recycled ocean plastics.\nOur bespoke carrying case features a magnetic closure.\n\n\nMorsel Metal's signature asymmetric shape fits where other utensils fail, so you can scrape every last bite, every time.\nMorsel Metal's fork is designed for serious forking. We never understood the use of itty-bitty tines at the end of a spoon. The spork world deserves better, so we're here to deliver.\nLength matters when you're sporking.\n\n\n\nMorsel's silicone spoon conforms to fit whatever you eat out of.\nMorsel Metal's spoon is wrapped in a high temp silicone. Perfect for cooking, scraping, and even using at home in your kitchen. It's durable, tough, and designed to last a lifetime.\nShow off your skillet skills.\n\n\n\nWHY ALUMINUM?  \nCompared to titanium,  7075-T6 aluminum has a better strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight. Basically, it's stronger and lighter. \nMorsel Metal's hard anodized coating acts as an ultra-hard, ultra-durable skin to protect and seal the metal. \n7075-T6 Aluminum is used in the construction of airplanes, bicycle frames, and now, finally... Sporks. \n\n\n\nHow light? Morsel Metal is one of the lightest utensils out there!  Our lightest Morsel Metal weighs in at a featherweight 0.5 ounces.\nFunction #42 - Great for cracking open a cold one when your fingernails are thrashed. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStretch Goals are extra funding targets that will allow us to offer new options - and even give away free stuff - IF we're wildly successful.\nIf we hit $200k we'll offer a limited edition Rainbow Spork.\nAnd if we hit $300k we'll give a FREE CASE to all of our backers!\nDo you really want a rainbow spork AND a free case?\nHelp us meet our $300k stretch goal by spreading the word to food-eaters and spork enthusiasts everywhere!\n\n\n\nHow Did We Get Here?\nDesigning stuff isn't easy, and making stuff is even tougher. We knew our last Kickstarter would be a massive undertaking, but we managed to pull it off, shipping our rad sporks to over 5000 spork enthusiasts around the world. Since then we've been hard at work building Morsel's community and talking to our fans to learn what they love, and what they lust for.\nCheck out these beautiful 3D models!\nWhen our Morsel fans requested a metal and silicone model, we knew we would be in for an adventure. The last year has been a wild ride between ideating, designing, prototyping, testing, and figuring out production. We've traveled to trade shows, visited factories, and even tried sporking while jumping out of an airplane (it was messy).\nOur sporks have been used at summer camps for the disabled, and while rowing across the oceans for ALS. We've hosted beer-and-food fundraisers for outdoor nonprofits, and handed out free sporks to new friends like sweet spork candy. We've loved all the positive feedback and encouragement we've received from the community, and if all goes well we're here to stay.\nThis Kickstarter is the result of a year's work, getting all the countless pieces in place to hit that launch button. \nWe're finally here, we're excited, and we're glad you're here with us helping make Morsel Metal a reality.\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1000+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $430M raised between them.\nWant to feature Morsel Metal?

Armed with the knowledge and experience from our previous campaigns, we've spent the last year focused on challenges like Production, Tooling, Fulfillment, Communication, and Customer Service.\n\nWith our team's combined 20+ years of product design and engineering experience, we spent the last year optimizing Morsel Metal for production manufacturing. We've traveled far and wide to visit and evaluate the factories that we'll be using for production - factories that produce kitchenware en masse for other popular household brands. And we've sat down with the production engineers at our factories for detailed discussions about our production processes because we want to ensure that everything goes off without a hitch and the end result is a quality product that our backers will be excited to use.\n\nWill there be surprises along the way?

We have fully stretched the game to perfection unlocking 15 Stretch Goals along the way that have upgraded all of the components, added some additional backstory cards, some mini expansions, a solo mode and expanded the Art Forgery case into a deeper experience.  We are looking forward to supporting Lawyer Up with a bunch of new case expansions down the line!\nClick the 'Late Pledge' button above and you'll be able to pledge/pre-order via Gamefound. Remember, this option will only be available for a limited time so act fast!\nIf you miss the Gamefound.com pledgemanager, you can visit our online store at https://shop.rockmanorgames.com to place a preorder (or just buy the game if it's available)\nIf you have any questions, be sure to check the FAQ or our most recent Kickstarter updates before messaging us directly!\nMeticulously designed and developed by Samuel W. Bailey (Forbidden Stars, Talisman: Cataclysm) and Mike Gnade (Maximum Apocalypse, the Few and Cursed) over the last 4 years, Lawyer Up is an asymmetrical two-player courtroom drama card game where one player is the noble prosecution and the other the steadfast defense. Each game begins with the Discovery phase, where players draft vital evidence to support their case and bury evidence that might help their opponent. Next comes the Trial phase, where players call witnesses and play powerful arguments along with the evidence they drafted into their examination pools. To form a coherent line of questioning, players will need to chain together their cards by matching bias symbols. The player who can best examine the Witness by generating the most influence will spend the difference to sway the Jury to their side. Every game is different, but the lawyer with the best case and most convincing arguments will be sure to get the verdict they are after!\nThe core game includes the base decks for both the prosecution and defense along with all the other components (jurors, bias tokens, etc) you need to play any case of Lawyer Up.  The core set also features two unique cases to play: The Art Forgery Case and the Murder Case.\nThe Art Forgery Case is a shorter case (6 Witnesses instead of 9) that focuses on learning the arguments and procedures in the base Prosecution and Defense decks.  It is all about drafting the paintings from famous Dutch painters and using the right evidence to replay them from discard piles.\nThe Murder Case is your modern Law and Order murder trial.  Jessica Fairmount was found standing over her father, covered in his blood, but insists that she was only trying to save him. The wealthy socialite has a lot to gain with her father's murder, but did she do it? This case features major asymmetry between the Prosecution (who can lock jurors to their side) and the Defense. The Prosecution must get all the Jurors to believe she is guilty while the Defense only needs one Juror to believe in her innocence for reasonable doubt.  \nLawyer Up is divided into two phases, the discovery and trial phases.  The discovery phase is a drafting phase representing both attorneys working back at their offices going through all the evidence of the case. During this phase, players simultaneously draw 3 cards and add one card to their deck, one card to their opponents deck and bury the last card.  This means that every time that you play a case, your deck will be unique.\nPlayers will not only draft unique decks, they will also select their legal strategies and Witnesses.  The trial phase of the game is typically made up of 9 rounds of witness examinations. During this phase, players take turns calling witnesses and chaining together legal arguments fighting to win the witness and influence the jury.\nYou can only play cards from your hand that share at least 1 symbol with the card previously in your Examination.  You can't jump from legal argument to an emotional one, because that would confuse the jury.\nAs you win witnesses, the jury will be swayed more and more to your side.  Each case can have slightly different win conditions, but in general whoever wins the most witnesses will have the jury on their side and win the case.\nFor the first time ever, Rock Manor Games has two deep thematic expansions already developed and available as part of this campaign!  Each expansion offers up new mechanics and win conditions - while staying true to the drafting and easy to learn card play of the core game.\nBetween February 1692 and May 1693 more than two hundred people were accused of being witches in colonial Massachusetts. This case takes a look at this infamous time in America's history, where mass hysteria is taking hold of the judicial system.\nThe Witch trial features over 80 unique illustrations by Abigail Larson whose art beautifully captures the time period.  The Witch Trial does away with the jury and is instead lead by an angry mob who is ready to hang anybody they believe is a witch. The goal of the Prosecution is to hang 3 witnesses as witches before they run out of cards.  The defense is scrambling to keep the mob under control and prevent a full blown witch hunt!\nThis case transports you back to Atlantic City in the 1920s where Carmine Monacelli is put on trial for conspiracy to violate the National Prohibition Act.  Carmine is accused of operating a network of criminals involved in bootlegging, murder, gambling and more - but he's a powerful man in AC so it's going to take more than some Federal Prohibition Agents to take down this Godfather. \nThe Godfather expansion features over 80 unique illustrations by Nabetse Zitro and introduces a Dossier deck. As players win witnesses, they are able to reveal or discard the top card of the Dossier deck.  The prosecution needs to prove Carmine's Mafia connections by revealing these Dossier cards while avoiding the powerful criminal activities such as \"Jury Tampering\" and \"Swim with the Fishes\" that the defense has shuffled into the deck.  \nWhile these expansions are planned for retail release, we plan on spreading out their release over a few months.  Kickstarter backers will get everything first! well before any of it enters retail and distribution.\n Tons more previews in the playlist below!\nRetailers \nWe love to work with retailers from all around the world. Brick and Mortar Retailers who back at our retailer pledge will receive an early demo copy of the Art Forgery case to promote Lawyer Up in their store.  The demo copy will be ordered shortly after the campaign ends and produced in the USA with the Game Crafter (most of the videos above feature such a prototype).  The shipping associated with this pledge is for the prototype only.  All orders for the actual game will be handled outside of Kickstarter.\nSomeone from Rock Manor Games will contact you after the Kickstarter to help you with your personalized order.  Retailers are NOT required to pay for their orders upfront, we simply invoice you for your order and ask that you pay the invoice before Kickstarter fulfillment commences (~6 months later).\nIf you're an online retailer or simply not interested in contributing on Kickstarter, signup as a retailer here. We will email you closer to our retail release so that you can get Lawyer Up into your store.\nGroup Pledges\nWe do not have a specific Pledge Level for Group Pledges and plan on handling this in our Pledge Manager.  If you have a group of friends and are looking to pledge for at least 6 copies of Lawyer Up, message us on our website at rockmanorgames.com/contact and select the Subject \"Group Pledge\".  You will need to make sure you pledge for at least 1 base game here on Kickstarter and then we will import you as a group pledge into the pledge manager after the campaign is completed.\nWhen our pledge manager is sent out via email, you will be asked to fill in your address and you will be charged for shipping at that time.  You must fill out the pledge manager and pay for shipping to receive your reward.  We know that high shipping costs are the worst, so we are offering a $5 shipping discount to all of our Kickstarter Backers. Here are our estimated shipping costs for this project. Keep in mind these are just estimates based on our 2020 shipping rates and costs could change based on a variety of circumstances.\n1: Lower 48 States\n2: Canada, Hawaii and Alaska\n3: Andorra, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norway, and Switzerland\n 4: Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam \n 5: Rest of World does not include Afghanistan, Brazil, Bolivia, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Niger, North Korea, Russia, South Africa, Syria, Somalia, Yemen. \nWe have key fulfillment partners in the US, Canada, Australia, China and the EU and will freight the games directly to them, so there will be no surprise charges, such as customs fees or VAT. We have typically shipped EU rewards from a German depot. For this campaign, it's possible we may ship UK rewards from within the UK if necessary We'll make this decision as we get closer to fulfillment, based on the fees/customs/taxes after Brexit has occurred.

They ensure every game is different.\n\nSetup only takes 3 minutes:\nClick to Read\nWe'll translate the rules into French, Spanish, and German after the campaign ends and send them to backers as PDFs before they receive their games. The game itself is largely language-independent.\nOur goal is to make games that spend more time on tables than shelves. No big rulebooks, no long setups, no hoping you might someday play that game you bought if only you could find new friends and ten more hours per week.\n18 months ago, we published our first game with this philosophy, Trekking the National Parks, which has since sold more than 80,000 copies. \nTrekking the World is a sequel, but not a re-skin. Charlie Bink, the designer of both games, studied what folks liked and disliked about Trekking the National Parks, then created a new system about world travel based on what he learned, to amplify the good and avoid the bad. \nIn fact, Charlie has been developing and refining his travel game system for 6 years now. When you play Trekking the World, we think you'll agree it shows.\nSee Never Board Gaming's video in the Game Preview section below for more about the differences between Trekking the World and Trekking the National Parks. \nWe believe passionately in keeping our campaign simple: one pledge level and no stretch goals. Time we could\u2019ve spent creating and managing a complex campaign, we instead used to polish gameplay and make high-quality components. Campaigns end but games are forever, so we owe it to our customers to put all our energy into the game itself.\nIf you want to see more campaigns like this, please share this one.\nWe'll send a survey to the email associated with your Kickstarter account within a week after this campaign ends, using the CrowdOx pledge manager. You'll be able to choose your add-ons and provide your shipping information at that time. If you change addresses before we ship your rewards, you'll be able to access your survey at this link  to do so.\nAll retailer units will include the Kickstarter exclusive card pack.\nWe want to make the process of ordering as seamless as possible for our retailers. Instead of doing a pledge, we\u2019re going to allow retailers to guarantee their pre-order units on this form and charge as the product ships.\nAll retailers will be vetted and confirmed to be a brick-and-mortar store. We do not allow any online stores. Proof of status will be required and vetted. Once approved, you will receive access to our wholesale platform.\nRetailer Shipping:\nFor US retailers, shipping will be free with 1 case with an MOQ of 6 units. For international retailers, please fill out the form and we will send you an estimate for cost of shipping. \nShipping fees will be charged in the pledge manager AFTER the campaign. Please take a look at our rates below. Reminder: these are estimated rates although we did everything in our power to make sure they're accurate to the final cost. \nClick to view sheet\nThis project is US, CA, EU, AU-friendly. Pledges will be shipped to distribution hubs in these countries and shipped from inside the countries. All VAT and customs will be prepaid for customers so no one will have to worry about receiving notices.\nBulk Pledges: For bulk pledges, please see the additional cost per pledge in the Google Sheet with shipping. If you have a high number of bulk pledges, please back with the correct amount for the bulk pledge, and we will reach out to you individually and work on getting you the actual shipping rate for your number of units.\n\n            The more copies you bulk pledge, the cheaper the shipping will be. Exact shipping calculations will be made when the campaign is over.\n\nMan vs Meeple are master game teachers. Watch their preview video for a comprehensive look at how to play Trekking the World. \n Here's another how-to-play from the incomparable Bebo:\nIf you're unsatisfied with your game after you receive it, contact us here and we'll refund you. Please tell us how we can do better by leaving feedback at the link.\nSometimes backers will encounter money issues and need to back out of a campaign after it's ended but before their rewards have shipped. We'll honor such requests as long as they're made prior to shipment.\nCampaign video and GIF graphics by:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019re a team of game industry professionals with experience making and selling board games at scale. \n\nUnlike most board game publishers, we sell most of our games directly to customers and retailers online.

It took a long time and I put what money I could into the stock, but eventually the Barry Lewis Veggie Prep Kit and Baking Mats, were born! \nDemand was bonkers, they sold out in the UK & USA within 5 hours. My aim is to slowly grow my brand and use kickstarter to make sure I don't run out of stock again and also help me develop the next batch of products! \nThe kickstarter exists for two reasons:\n1. To help me fund the stock for veggie kits, with new features.\n2. To help fund my next product - a cake kit, featuring a turntable / stand as seen in my videos.\nThe rewards are simple - if you want a veggie prep kit or cake stand / turntable, back it, then when the campaign ends I know what to order and will ship them out!\nAs an exclusive to Kickstarter any Veggie prep kit or cake kit backed here can be shipped Internationally with the option for it to be signed!

This offer is only for Kickstarter backers, so don't miss out! \nWatch the Runthrough in the How to Play Section\nEveryone knows Tumble Town deserves to be the best town in the West - so it needs a mayor to match! The Tumble Townspeople are hosting a competition to turn the town tootin\u2019 and boomin\u2019! It\u2019s up to you to impress them with your construction and planning skills!\nIn Tumble Town players are rolling dice, constructing buildings, and competing to make the best town in the West.\n Dice Manipulation & Engine Building: Each building you construct gives you more powers and options. Certain buildings can let you manipulate the dice, making it easier to continue constructing! Other buildings can generate dice or give extra scoring objectives. \n Spatial Puzzle: Place your constructed buildings along Main Street to create your town. The townspeople want a specific look for the town and if you meet their requirements, you'll gain even more votes from the townspeople!\n Added Scoring Conditions: Construct the right buildings and you can gain more scoring conditions as the game progresses! These can include the size of your constructed buildings, the animals and plants near your constructed buildings, or even the types  of buildings constructed by your neighbors. \nCan you build the best town in the West?\n            ULTRA EDITION TIER WOODEN BOX\nUltra Edition Wooden Box Design is Not Finished. Final Version May Look Different.\n Below is a How to Play video:\nRahdo does a Runthrough below: \nTumble Town Overview\nIn Tumble Town, you are a mayor trying to best meet the needs of the townspeople by constructing the buildings they desire. Your goal is to have satisfied the townspeople by the time the building materials run out. You make the townspeople happy by constructing buildings, placing the constructed buildings on Main Street in the best formation, and making the townspeople care about other aspects of their town, like the cacti and windmills. \nEach building plan requires certain building materials (die colors) and has restrictions on what die values are needed. \nEach turn goes through a series of four phases: \n1. Claim (take a card)\n2. Take Dice + Roll\n3. Construct + Use Powers\n4. Place + Discard Extra Dice\nClaim a Building Plan\nYou can choose any of the 12 available building plans. You might choose a building plan based on the materials you currently have to build, the benefit that the building gives you when you construct it, the point value, or for the icon it has. \nTake Dice and Roll\nYou may now take the dice shown on the stack of the cards in the row of the  building plan you choose. \nConstruct and Use Powers\nNow that you have dice and a building plan, you can construct a building! You may use any of the powers from either your constructed buildings or your horse to help you manipulate your dice into what the building plan requires. \nPlace and Discard Extra Dice\nOnce you construct your building, it's time to place the building on Main Street. You can gain points by matching the criteria on Main Street and you can also get points by making alleys between buildings. \nYou may only carry over dice that fit into your Storehouse to your next turn, so if you have more than six, you must choose some to discard back into the supply. \nGame End\nPlayers take turns until the Dice Supply runs out. Once two of the supplies get below two dice, the game end is triggered and all players take an equal amount of turns. \nScores are tallied and Horses revealed; the player with the most points wins! \nSolo Game\nIf playing the game solo, you simply choose an Outlaw to play against and start the game! The Outlaw has quick turns and makes the game a race to get the best building materials. There's three difficulties of Outlaw to try and outwit and only the best of the best can win against the Outlaw!\nThe Solo Missions will give you a point goal and an objective and if you meet it, you move on to the next one. The goals get progressively more difficult as the game goes on. \n Solo Playthrough:\n Rules and Print and Play\nThe rules are here (the rules are not complete nor do they have graphic design):  Rules Link \nThe rules are planned to be translated into French and Italian.

It will be hard to get after the KS ends, as we won't order many extra! \nPeople sometimes wonder why they should back a Kickstarter campaign instead of waiting to get the game later in retail. The most important reason not to wait with Tumble Town is that even if Tumble Town funds, we currently don't know if Tumble Town will go into distribution. If you wait, you may end up missing out, as we won\u2019t have many extra copies to sell and unless your local store backs the campaign, they won\u2019t be carrying it either.\n Kickstarter Limited \u2013 Tumble Town might be very hard to find after the campaign, outside of select conventions. This is especially true for the playmat! \n Help Us Improve Tumble Town \u2013 We have a ton of stretch goals planned to help improve the game for everyone!\n Discounted \u2013 After the campaign, we will sell the extra copies at a higher cost.\n EU Friendly \u2013 copies will be sent from inside the EU so backers won't have to pay VAT taxes. \nMost importantly, without you, Tumble Town would not get created.\nTumble Town is a game we truly love and want to share with the world. We've worked on this game for years to make it perfect for you. Tumble Town ties together engine building with spatial puzzles to create a truly unique gaming experience. We love playing and know you will, as well.\nWe really appreciate your support in making our dream a reality.\nWe would love to support game stores by offering the Kickstarter versions of Tumble Town to retailers during the campaign. Back the project at the retailer level for $50, and we'll contact you closer to when we ship out rewards to get a count of games that you wish to get! An invoice will be sent to you before we ship your rewards.\nShipping is free for retailers in the US, $10 for the EU, $25 for retailers outside the US and EU. \nSocial Goals\nHelp us reach five out of the seven social goals, and we'll add a Best Mayor (name subject to change) card to the game! If we meet all seven goals, we'll include a special promo card in the game, as well!\n Here's the links: BGG Page (Sign in to your account, then click the heart button), Facebook, Facebook post, Twitter, Twitter tweet, Instagram, Subreddit, Youtube Channel, and Facebook Group.\nWe will be charging shipping after the campaign ends. This ensures you get charged the shipping you deserve. No more, no less.\nBy doing this, we are able to factor in your pledge tier, add-ons, and all fancy things that may occur during the campaign. However, we can offer estimated shipping costs. Below is estimated pricing for one copy of the game.\n100 dice actually weighs a lot! And shipping is based on weight, unfortunately, so shipping costs are a bit more than our usual for this reason.  \nPlease keep in mind these are estimates and there can be slight variations from country to country. Also, the more items you purchase, the more shipping will cost. If you have any questions, please email us at contact@weirdgiraffegames.com.\n*We are currently not planning to ship to the following areas: Mexico, Brazil, and Russia.\nWe are currently considering the UK to be within the EU at this time. We know that shipping will change for the UK in 2021, but the ways that that will change are not currently known. Also, we're hoping to ship in 2020 so that is hopefully not an issue! The estimates on the tier levels include buffer months in case several things go wrong, but that may not be the case. \nTo order a second copy of Tumble Town, add an additional $29 to your pledge with no additional shipping cost.\nWe are happy to discuss group orders, but these need to be handled on a country-by-country basis.

We also want you to know that we take this very seriously.\n\nAlthough we have already successfully funded and delivered multiple projects on Kickstarter, Tumble Town will have it's own unique issues. We would love if everything went smoothly, but we are also trying to be prepared for any problem that could arise.\n\nTumble Town will be manufactured by a reputable company but international shipping always has the potential for delays and complications.\n\nIf things run behind schedule, we think the best approach is to always be up front and communicative with backers. It's our goal to make post-campaign updates part of this experience and we plan to update monthly until the game has shipped to backers in order to keep backers informed of the progress of Tumble Town.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Follow Along", "descp": "Follow along with the campaign.

For 2020 I'm compiling the report quarterly which means a smaller number of projects, probably around 700 and less projects mean I can space everything out more. So now you have more information for more projects at your finger tips.\nThe feedback I got from the 2019 report was that you wanted the small projects to get the same level of exposure as the big projects. So all of this years projects will get the same quarter page listing, whether they had 2 backers or 10 million. One of the aims I have with the report is to bring more exposure to smaller project creators so this feels like the right way to go.\nEach listing will include all the details and images you need to get a real flavour of the project. The images are in high resolution so you can zoom right in for a better look. You get a breakdown of the top pledge levels and the PDF version also includes web links to projects, their creators, websites and social media. Every project is categorised to group similar things together and help you find what you're looking for fast.\nYou might not realise the real value of the report until you have used it for yourself, so I have created a sample for you to try it out. It's a PDF so you can view it on your computer or tablet, you can zoom in on the pictures, it's fully searchable and crammed with web links. \nThe full report will include about 700 projects which end successfully between 1st January and 31st March. I'll be working through the night to get the finished report available for download on the 1st April so you get it bang up to date. If you want to you can pay for the whole year up front. You'll save a bit but also it's done and then you can just forget about it. I'll send a message to remind you when each report is released.\nSpring (1st January - 31st March) released 1st April\nSummer (1st April - 30th June) released 1st July\nAutumn (1st July - 31st September) released 1st October\nWinter (1st October - 31st December) released 1st January 2021\n Print copies will be available after the campaign using DriveThruRPGs print on demand service.\nIf you missed the 2019 report you can check out the Kickstarter project or you can buy a copy from DriveThruRPG.

Scroll down to find out more \ud83d\udc47\nWith Geco Hub, your things are kept secure, visible and easy to grab at a moment\u2019s notice.\nWouldn't it be cool if you got home from a day at work and all the stuff you have in your pockets - phone, keys, wallet, etc... could just be thrown against the wall and forgetten about? Instead of dropping everything on a counter-top, they can be kept out the way.\nWhatever it is, Geco Hub can hold it.\nCombining fun and practicality, Geco Hub saves time by keeping your valuables and belongings all in one place and declutters surfaces.\nPart storage unit, part notice board, Geco Hub is flexible and adaptable. You can organise your things where you want them, in a way that suits you.\nThere are tonnes of ways to store items in Geco Hub\nGeco Hub's patented flexible matrix adapts to instantly and securely hold your things, whatever shape or size they are. It's quick, fun and intuitive.\n\nGeco Hub separates your important things from the day-to-day clutter and ensures you never have to search for your keys when heading out the door ever again.\nWhether it's your e-book reader and reading glasses \ud83d\udc53 by the bed, car keys \ud83d\udd11 and a shopping list by the door \ud83d\udcdd, or your favourite utensils in the kitchen \ud83e\udd63, Geco Hub keeps your important things in easy reach, so they're there where and when you need them.\nRemove surface clutter and keep your belongings safe\nInstall Geco Hub wherever you find yourself reaching for stuff.\nGeco Hub might be small in size but not in spirit. It packs the punch of larger organisers, all whilst staying close to the wall, making it perfect for smaller living spaces. Its small size means it can fit on wall spaces other organisers just can\u2019t too.\nI'd like to see you put a shelf on the side of a fridge!\nThe thing that sucks about wall-mounted storage is mounting the damn thing on the wall in the first place! No need to worry about that with Geco Hub. \nStick the optional adhesive strips onto the placeholders on Geco Hub's backboard.\nGeco Hub installs in minutes with strong, yet removable, adhesive strips (available as an add-on) or using the included screw fixings for something more permanent.\nTake off the outer tape and stick Geco Hub on the wall. Easy as 1, 2, 3.\nThe option of using adhesive strips or screws means you can mount it to tiles, glass, brick walls, plaster walls, wooden furniture and even the side of your fridge. Wherever you want.\nWhatever the surface is, chances are you can fix Geco Hub to it.\nThese optional adhesive strips won\u2019t mark the wall either, keeping you and your landlord happy. If you want to remove them, just pull the tab down and away. They're strong too, meaning you can fill Geco Hub with up to 2.5kg/5lb of things. \nUse the screw fixings included with your Geco Hub to screw it to the wall.\nScrew fixings come with Geco Hub as standard, and adhesive strips are an optional extra. To get adhesive strips with Geco Hub just add \u00a33 to your pledge.  \nRemove without leaving a mark. These adhesive strips are available as an add-on.\nWe made an earlier version of Geco Hub a few years ago and it got quite a bit of press. This version is based on feedback from early users and lots of testing so now Geco Hub is better than ever! \nYou can read about the earlier version and what's changed further down the page \ud83d\udc47\nWant to feature Geco Hub?

Check out the rewards further down \ud83d\udc47\n\nAs Geco Hub seamlessly tiles together you can install Geco Hub any layout you want.\nWhether it's for...\nA big, shared hub for the family\nA long notice board and organiser for the hallway\nQuirky toy storage in the kid's room\n... Or something for that awkward space you've been scratching your head over, Geco Hub has it covered \ud83d\ude0e\nThere is no limit to how big you could make Geco Hub. You could fill entire walls! (20 units shown here)\nYour wall is the canvas and you're the artist, create your very own piece of functional wall art with Geco Hub. \nRows, squares, rectangles, zig-zags, a checkerboard. The list goes on...\n(Note: this GIF is a digital rendering, as we only had two final prototypes at the time of launch.)\n\nGeco Hub's backboard is made from ABS, the same durable and tough material used in power tool casings, LEGO bricks, the keys on your keyboard, and more. This means it can comfortably live up to the rigours of everyday use.\nABS plastic is used for Geco Hub's backboard.\nGeco Hub's round disc and rectangular fins are made from silicone rubber, which is made from silica sand. That's right, sand! Silicone rubber is strong, stain-resistant and easy to clean, it won't deform over time like other rubbers, and has a great \"soft touch\" feel to it too. It's not cheap, but it is hands-down the best material for the job. \nSilica sand is used to make silicone rubber, the ingredient for Geco Hub's fins and discs.\n\nStill not impressed? Here are 10 extra benefits and features that help make Geco Hub great.\nSize it up\nWe know that it's one thing looking at nice photos online, but another thing entirely imagining something on your wall at home. So here are Geco Hub's key dimensions.\nOkay, so we've thrown some numbers at you, want more info? No problem! Here are a few common everyday items stored in Geco Hub so you can get a better idea of scale... \nAnd finally... the extra details just in case you're interested.\n\n\nEvery little helps in a project like this, so if you're not completely sold on getting yourself a Geco Hub but want to help out with the project anyway, you can pledge a minimum of \u00a31.\nAnyone who pledges will receive exclusive access to news and updates about Geco Hub, so you won't miss out on the latest. You'll also receive a digital postcard with a thank you note from the Version 22 Team.\n\nAdd-ons\nTo include one or more add-ons, simply:\n1) Sum up the cost of the add-ons you'd like\n2) Add this total to your chosen Reward when backing the campaign. \nAfter the campaign, we will send out a survey so you can confirm your choice. \n\n\nTrade\nIf you're a distributor or retailer interested in Geco Hub we'd love to hear from you, get in touch with us via email at trade[at]version22[dot]com today.\n\n\nWe've delivered three campaigns to date (including an earlier version of Geco Hub), so this isn't our first rodeo.\nAs with any manufacturing project, however, there are always unknowns that pop out of nowhere. That said, we're confident we can tackle anything that comes our way.\nWe've already got suppliers lined up for most of the components, and have had manufactures evaluate all of our designs to confirm that they're suitable for mass production, so we don't anticipate any major problems.\n\n\nYou've probably already heard, but we launched an earlier version of Geco Hub a few years ago!\nWhen we launched the original Geco Hub in 2014, we ended up shipping to dozens of countries, solving the problem of lost belongings all over the world! But we weren't done innovating there...\nTaking user feedback from this first version, as well as our own experiences designing it, we worked tirelessly to develop the new and improved version you see today.\nAt 4 by 4 circles, the new version is a little smaller (but rest assured lower in price too!), which makes it even better suited to those small areas around the home that nothing else fits. \nThe new Geco Hub is also more versatile with what items it can hold and how it can hold them. \nFinally, the new version is the same colour all over, instead of having a white backboard like the old design. All in all... nothing but improvements!\n\nPrototypes \nAs I'm sure you can imagine, we didn't arrive at the final design for Geco Hub right away. In fact, dozens of prototypes and thousands of hours of development have gone into it. He's just a small snapshot of what was involved.\n\n\nOver the last 5 years, we've successfully funded 3 different products with a total of more than 3,000 backers and shipped to more than 80 countries. We're excited to bring Geco Hub back to life with a new and improved design!\nThe first Geco Hub had 339 backers and raised \u00a325,106\nNimble had 1,893 backers that pledged a total of \u00a334,757\n... and our last project was Mobu with 814 backers that pledged a total of \u00a320,402\n\n\n\nAt Version 22, we aim to make functional gift and home products which solve REAL everyday problems in ways that make you smile :)\nWe have successfully launched three different brands through crowdfunding platforms (Kickstarter and Indiegogo), and our product ideas have collected a bunch of national and international design awards between them, and have featured heavily in national and international press too.\nWe love making things, and will continue doing so... until someone stops us!

Here's to the next! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've successfully fulfilled three Kickstarter campaigns to date. So we're well versed with the complications and challenges that these projects present.\n\nThough we've had our fair share of unexpected delays (as with almost all Kickstarter campaigns) we've learnt and improved each time and are confident we can deliver Geco Hub by the date given.\n\nThe main challenges with a silicone rubber and plastic product like Geco Hub is the tooling process, which takes up a good chunk of the overall schedule, and the logistics involved with moving thousands of components from location to location, so that everything happens where and when it's meant to. That said, we're working with a manufacturing coordinator who we've worked with before, and we are confident in our joint ability to get the job done.\n\nWe have already produced test tooling for Geco Hub's silicone rubber fins, and have had the tooling for Geco Hub's other components pre-approved by mold tool designers.\n\nWith our background in engineering and design, and 5 years experience manufacturing and shipping products around the world, we're confident Geco Hub will be in your hands in no time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nGeco Hub is designed to be durable and long-lasting; a product that becomes part of your home, not something that breaks after a few months. \n\nAlso, all of Geco Hub's parts assemble without glue and are replaceable, so if the worse happens, you can replace just one or two parts and not have to replace the whole thing.\nSustainable materials\nAll of Geco Hub's flexible parts are made from silicone rubber. Silicone rubber is derived from silicon, the stuff sand is often made up of. Silicon is the 2nd most abundant material on Earth, it's not made from non-renewable petrochemicals like many synthetic rubbers. It won't degrade and become brittle over time like many other rubbers either.\n\nGeco Hub's backboard is made using ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) plastic. ABS is a very tough and durable plastic often used for the casings of products that need to be really strong, like power tools. Because of this Geco Hub's backboard can withstand last years of rigorous use without needing to be replaced.\n\nGeco Hub's packaging will be 100% plastic-free and made from sustainably sourced card and paper.

It also requires that manufacturers limit potentially toxic ingredients in their dyes and manufacturing processes, and that they have processes in place to limit and treat waste water. Our manufacturer ensures that the water used in the dying process is still clean enough to be recycled for irrigation and other purposes.\nThe GOTS social criteria requires safe and hygienic working conditions for employees, the payment of living wages, regular and fair working hours, and the right for workers to unionise. It also prohibits child labor, forced labor, discrimination, and harsh or inhumane treatment.\nTo read more about the GOTS certification and their criteria, please see their website here.\nLudoCherry x Level Up Dice\nWe're collaborating with Level Up Dice to bring you these gorgeous d20s, all inspired by our unique fabric designs!

Please add $15 to your pledge for each pin you would like! \nIf you'd like to add on more button-up shirts to your pledge, please make sure you're backing at the Shirt Pledge or the Shirt and Skirt Pledge level. For each shirt you'd like to add, please increase your pledge by $70 AUD.\nIf you'd like to add on more skirts to your pledge, please make sure you're backing at the Skirt Pledge or the Shirt and Skirt Pledge level. For each skirt you'd like to add, please increase your pledge by $100 AUD. \nTo quickly figure out which level you should back, and the total amount, please use our pledge calculator below! \nIf you're still not sure how to pledge, feel free to message us and we'll get back to you as soon as possible. \nThe size charts below will help you find your perfect fit! The best way to ensure we have your size is to find and measure a similar garment that you already own. You can also use the US and UK size equivalents as a guide, but we recommend measuring as well since sizing can be so variable between brands.\nPlease note that all of the measurements in the charts refer to the size of the garment, not your body measurements. We explain how to use them underneath each chart.\nClick through for a larger version\nTo find your skirt size, you'll need to get your waist measurement! Use a soft tape measure and measure around the smallest part of your waist (above your belly button and below your ribs). For a more detailed explanation of how to measure yourself, please see this link.\nThe back waistband of the skirt has elastic, and can stretch up to 10cm / 4\".\nIf you prefer a snug fit around your waist, please select a size where your measurement is in the high end of the waist measurement range (For example, a size 14 for an 87cm waist). This means the elastic will be more stretched when you wear it, and will feel firmer.\nIf you prefer a looser fit around your waist, please select a size where your measurement is in the low end of the range (For example, a size 20 for a 97cm waist). This means the elastic will be more relaxed on you.\nClick through for a larger version\nTo find your shirt size, we recommend measuring a similar button-up shirt you already own and feel comfortable in. Our shirts are semi-fitted, so make sure the shirt you're measuring isn't loose or baggy around the chest and waist.\nTo find your shirt's chest measurement, lay it flat on a hard surface and measure across the front from one underarm seam to the other. Please watch this video for a thorough guide of how to do this.\nOnce you have your shirt's chest measurement, round up to the next size in the size chart that will fit you. For example, for a 56cm chest you would size up to a M.\nYou can also take your shirt's shoulder width and length measurements, if you'd like to make sure that the size you've selected will fit. The videos linked below explain in detail how to do this:\nFinding your shirt's shoulder width\nFinding your shirt's length\nAll shipping will be handled in the pledge manager after the campaign is completed. You will be charged separately from your pledge on Kickstarter! \nThe chart below is an estimate of the shipping costs, based on your pledge level and your country. Please note that these are in Australian dollars.\n Zone 1: Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam\n Zone 2: US, Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand, France, Germany, Netherlands, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden\n Zone 3: Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Luxembourg, Norway, Switzerland\n Zone 4: Cyprus, Malta, Iceland\nUnfortunately, we are unable to ship to Afghanistan, Cuba, Iran, Kazakhstan, North Korea, Myanmar, Russia, Sudan, Syria, and Ukraine.\nIf your country isn't listed please get in touch with us! We will do our best to get you a shipping estimate. You can message us through Kickstarter, or send an email to hello@ludocherry.com, and we will get back to you as soon as possible.\nIf you are adding items onto your pledge, each additional shirt will add ~$3-6 shipping and each additional skirt will add ~$5-8 shipping.\nIf you are planning on ordering a large number of items and would like a more accurate estimate, please get in touch with us!\nIf you're a retailer interested in stocking LudoCherry in your store, or getting our clothing for your staff to wear to work, please get in touch with us!\nYou can email us at retail@ludocherry.com, or message us on Kickstarter.\n There are a few reasons! \nThe first is that Kickstarter allows us to raise the funds we need to actually make LudoCherry a reality. We\u2019ve already invested a large amount of our personal savings into developing our business, our fabric designs, and our clothing, but the amount of money required for a production run is beyond our reach. With your support, we'll be able to raise the money we need for the production run.\nKickstarter also allows us to solve many of the issues that traditional clothing brands face. Companies often create their clothes in limited size ranges and colours, to prevent profit loss on variations that don't sell. By using Kickstarter, and knowing in advance what our backers will be ordering, we\u2019re able to create a much more inclusive range. We'll be able to order more of the sizes and fabrics that are the most in demand, and reduce our loss on the less popular variations - meaning we can afford to create a wide range of sizes and fabrics for you to wear! \nFinally, Kickstarter allows us to interact directly with our community, and take your feedback and ideas on board. We want you to be as excited to wear LudoCherry as we are, so we want to use Kickstarter as a chance to talk with you about what we're doing well and what we could be doing better.\nFinally we'd like to extend a special thanks to some people who helped us make LudoCherry the best it can be.\nTo James Mathe, Jamey Stegmaier, Daniel Zayas, and Martyn Poole - Thank you for your contributions to the crowdfunding community, and for always being willing to give advice.\nTo Ted and Toni - Thank you for seeing my passion for the industry, and for all your support.\nTo Neil Thomson and the Albury Game Club - All of this is your fault.\nTo my parents - Thank you for always supporting me, even when I gave up politics for game design.\n -Phoebe", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAlthough this is our first Kickstarter as a company, we both have years of experience working within the board game industry. Phoebe has worked on 6 successful Kickstarter campaigns through her position as Bezier Games' Social Media Manager (raising a total of over $2.5 million USD).\n\nMark has worked in film for 6 years as a Producer and Assistant Director. As a result, he is experienced in managing logistics for large scale and complex projects, as well as meeting production deadlines. \n\nWe are confident that our combined experience will allow us to finalise and deliver a high quality project. All of our art is completed, and we have a manufacturer ready to start production after our campaign.\n\nIn the event that we receive samples back from the manufacturer that are not up to our standards, we may need to make alterations to the garment design or work with them to ensure a higher quality. However, we have built in sufficient time to our estimated delivery date to allow for this.\n\nAs a smaller company, it is also possible for us to be pushed back in the production queue for the manufacturer to prioritise larger brands.\n\nFinally, the ongoing coronavirus crisis in China has the potential to cause delays to our production and shipping. Currently it appears that factories are reopening, but we are not able to tell how the situation will evolve.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nOur clothes are designed to be high quality statement pieces that will last in your wardrobe for years to come.

We're also printing our fabric using digital printing, so the colour will be brighter and last for longer.\n\nOur clothing has also been designed by our professional pattern-makers to be durable, with reinforced seams at the points that see the most movement and wear.\n\nFinally, our clothing pieces are simple but classic styles that won't go out of fashion - so our backers won't feel the need to throw them out for the next hot \"fast fashion\" item.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nWe're proud to say that our manufacturer is certified by the Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) as both ethical and environmentally sustainable.\n\nThe Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) is the worldwide leading textile processing standard for organic fibres, including ecological and social criteria, backed up by independent certification of the entire textile supply chain.\n\nThe GOTS environmental criteria requires that all textiles are made of at least 70% organic fibres.

All games have been created along Italian authors and the illustrators that you have already seen in our previous titles. Each game has its own identity and the boxes are as small as 12x8 cm. You can carry them with you, slide the matchbox and play in just 20 minutes with cards and small bits that will make the whole experience so satisfying!\nNatural phenomena have had an odd behaviour lately, seasons seem to have been disrupted and animals are migrating in the wrong direction. The 24 East Asian traditional solar terms are out of sync. Your seasons must find their alignment so the sun can find its route again and set the order right among all living things.\nIn 15 days, players will take alternating turns. Each turn choose 2 out of 4 possible actions, trying to receive the  animals pawns for special abilities and completing sets of Season cards for the most points at the end of the game.\nMenace is approaching you. There seems to be a way out, but as a Samurai your first move is to reach for your weapons. Your basic instincts to run and hide have dissolved since the only option left is to fight for your honour. You are a rock and will hold tight, fighting the opponents face to face, using your weapons until the the very end.\nEiyo is a fast paced game where you need to strategically manage your weapons to defeat hordes of enemies. You will need to survive the attacks while gaining honour points that will be crucial at the end of the game.\nAfter relentless days spent diluting solvents and heating liquid mixtures in vials, the air is damp, while the old and overused books stored in the library of your laboratory smell of humidity and dust. The end of the day is approaching and you have just found the perfect transmutation. You decide to stay a little longer, but you know the candles will stay on until they consume completely.\nRebis is a 1\u20134 player game. To win, you have to play your alchemistic ingredients wisely in order to brew the best elixirs and find the right time to brew them to get the most points.\nThe multiverse has spoiled you given the vastness of incredible places and creatures to meet and observe. You smell spices from miles away, your pores dilate, your gills tickle and your three stomachs are growling like an echoing symphony. You get to the source of the tasty fumes faster than a ray of light, your taste buds start working as a glowing sign shows up on the horizon: \u201cServing succulent food and spicy, quenching potions during satellite setting hours.\u201d\nSpace Lunch is a 1-2 players, short, set-collection game. To win, you need to grab your preferred dishes before it\u2019s too late by choosing Food cards from the table. However, beware! Your opponent might interfere with your plans.\nThe new surface of Earth is at its most bleak appearance. It may seem completely infertile and arid, but on the horizon promising mountains of mud and clay arise higher and higher. Golems, the magical mutable creatures, are being summoned with synergies among the resources of the earth.\nGolems is a card collection game where you can use every card in two different ways. You have to decide whether you want to boost your Golem for victory points or save the resource to summon further Golems. With the use of Gems and special Runes you will be able to maximize your strategy to become the best Golem summoner.\nWe have always created games that we really enjoy playing and the Matchbox Collection is no exception, but every time we launch a new line of games, it is fundamental for us to understand if our vision resonates with you.\nAfter a year since our last campaign, we are very excited to share a brief moment with you to shape this new creation together; and this is among the most interesting and rewarding moments for us.\nKickstarter and retail are two very different worlds and both of them are extremely important for us, but sometimes you want to create something regardless of the production boundaries, and Kickstarter is the best place to shape the games we dreamt of exactly the way we envisioned them.\nThundergryph exclusive is a new way for us to experiment, understand the product better and find the best way to make it work; and while we are not offering a retail option, it doesn\u2019t mean that this line won\u2019t have a possibility of hitting retail.\nThese games might become a collectible exclusive to this campaign, but they could reach more players in the future as well. For now, this campaign is the best chance we have to offer them to you directly at an honest price and make these games happen.\nWe really appreciate your support and we thank you for being the foundation of our imagination.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs this is our 7th campaign, we feel that it is important for us as creators to share with you what we have learnt throughout all the other campaigns and during 2019.\n\nTIMELINE IS EVERYTHING.\n\nWhile we always set important goals for the year, revising the timeline is something we have been doing for the past 3 years, and it was not a surprise for us that Tang Garden was about to create an important change in our timeline for 2019. \nShaping the games together with our backers is one of the most interesting things of being a Kickstarter creator, but all of this additional content needs to be meticulously calculated before the campaign starts to add enough buffer time to the communicated timeline, while still being unaware of how successful a project will be.\n\nRevising the timeline affects your perception towards us and affects the company stability by postponing future releases.\n\nNEW WORKFLOW AND KICKSTARTER.\n\nWhen you back one of our campaigns, you are not pre-ordering a product, you are really helping us make the game happen.

Four new mint making companies have noticed the profit potential of Mintopia City and have moved in, in an attempt to dominate the market and make all of the money. Players will take the role of one of four mint making companies and assert their influence over various locations in Mintopia City to secure their loyalties and earn the market share.\nMint Control is designed to provide a small footprint introduction experience to the Area Control and Action Selection genres of gaming that is fun and rewarding for new and seasoned gamers alike.\nSet Up\nShuffle the Location Cards, and randomly add Locations to the game area until there are at least 5 Influence Token spaces per player.\n                            (10 for 2 players, 15 for 3 players and 20 for 4 players.)\nPut the remaining Location cards to the side, they will not be used in this game. Place the 5 Action tiles near the Location cards, this is the Selection Pool.\nPlace the Mint Tokens near the Location Cards. This forms the Mint Supply, each player then takes 2 Mints from the Supply as their starting currency.\nEach player selects a color and takes the 5 Influence Tokens for that color.\nThe player with the freshest breath starts the game with the Starting Player Token.\nGameplay\nEach round, the starting player will select one of the available Action tiles and place it in front of them. They will then perform that Action, followed by the Perk in its entirety.\nThen in clockwise order around the table, each other player will perform that same Action (but not the perk) until each player has had the option to perform the Action if able.\nAfter every player has had the option to perform the action chosen by the starting player, the next player in clockwise order will choose one of the remaining available Action Tiles. This process continues until each player has selected one Action tile.\nAfter the final Action has been fully processed, if there are not enough remaining Action tiles for each player to choose from the remaining cards, return all of the chosen Action tiles to the selection pool, so that all Action tiles are available in the next round.\nFinally, the Starting Player token passes to the next player in clockwise order, and a new round begins.\nAction Tiles\nWhen an action is selected by a player, that player performs both the Action and Perk. Then clockwise around the table each other player performs only the Action.\nInfluence\nThe Influence Action allows players to pay Mints to add an Influence Token to an open Influence space. The Perk for selecting this Action reduces the cost to Influence a Location by 1, to a minimum of 0.\nEarn\nThe Earn Action gives players Mints to spend on future turns. The Perk for selecting this Action is to gain an additional Mint.\nPresence\nThe Presence Action grants each player the Presence bonus for each Location where they have Influence. The Perk for this Action is gain the eviction bonus from a Location that the player controls.\nOust\nThe Oust Action gains each player one Mint, similar to Earn. However, the perk for Oust is to spend 1 Mint to remove any 1 Influence Token from a Location. Then an additional 3 Mints can be spent to remove a second Influence token from a Location. The second token has no additional restrictions, it can be on the same or a different Location, and the same or a different player.\nScavenge\nThe Scavenge Action does not provide an Action for all players, only the player that selected it. That player can choose to gain 1 Mint from the Supply, or steal 1 Mint from another player.\nWin/Lose Conditions \nThe game ends at the end of the Action in which at least one player has all 5 of their influence tokens on Locations.\nPlayers gain points for each Location they control. The player with the most points, wins!\nIn the event of a tie, the player with the most Mints left over wins.\nThen, the tied player that has the most Influence placed on locations wins.\nThen, the tied player whose age is closest to 42 wins.\nPLAYTHROUGH\nYou are my biggest advocates and I need you to shout from the rooftops so this project can succeed the best it can.

Those who do not fill in their surveys by the wave 1 cutoff may be subject to VAT and shipping fees, if incurred, outside the USA.\n Our partners will be offering the Mint Series in the following languages. \n These languages are NOT available through this Kickstarter campaign.\nSpieleschmiede ran a short crowdfunding campaign for the Mint Series in German.\n We would like to support retailers who are interested in getting Mint Control, as well as Mint Works, Mint Delivery & Mint Cooperative before the games make their way into distribution. If you're a retailer, please email retail@five24labs.com during the campaign for pricing information.\nThe Mint Series was born of the 2017 BoardGameGeek Mint Tin Challenge where designer Justin Blaske submitted Mint Works, the Minty Fresh Worker Placement Game. Following the contest, he brought Mint Works to Kickstarter where it funded on Day 1 and went on to become an evergreen product, selling over 30,000 copies -- and it's still reprinting! His second design, Mint Delivery, the Minty Fresh Pick Up and Deliver Game, was a huge Kickstarter success, funding in the first hour, raising almost $200,000, and expanding into the French market. Most recently, Mint Cooperative funded over $100,000 and gained partners around the world: the Mint Series has fresh new versions in French, Italian, Chinese, and Japanese.\nThe Mint Universe has become its own licensed IP and we are having more and more industry designers submit designs to join our series. Our vision is to make singular modern board game mechanisms approachable by designing games that are simple to play, easy to teach, and a quick play time.\nThe Mint Series follows the narrative of Mort, introduced in the first game. After much success launching his mint-making company, Mort branched out and provided mints to surrounding towns and regions. Unfortunately, villains from the Dominion of Halitosis  grew jealous of his success, and the Mint Cooperative was launched to protect the citizens of Mintopia from the threat of periodontal peril. With peace restored and the villains defeated, Mort now finds himself threatened by other mint magnates trying to steal his success!  It has been exciting to see characters and locations evolve to have more personality through the games' progression, and it is thrilling to continue the saga in this exciting title.\nQuackalope's storytelling expertly explains how the world of Mintopia unfolded and dive into the characters we are falling in love with.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith an established Mint Series, we've learned a lot about the game making process, from start to finish.

For ages 14 and up, higher complexity level. Play time is 15-30 minutes per player. \nThe goal of the game is to unravel the reason/mission why your alien faction is on the Ark and then activate specific parts of the Ark in order to achieve your mission.The first player that does so, wins.\nIntroducing Ark: Awakening - Theme and Story\nYou awake from cryogenic sleep in a strange biodome that resembles your home planet. You have no memory of how and why you are there \u2013 apparently a temporary loss of memory is a side effect of the cryogenic sleep. You start exploring and find out that your biodome is just one of infinitely many rooms on a traveling semi automated alien space ship \u2013 the Ark. Each room is the size of a city and the Ark is the size of a planet. You explore the Ark, opening and enabling parts of the ship, you power up rooms, integrate the Ark\u2019s technology with your own in order to advance your faction, exploit resources needed to awake the rest of your species, collect alien artifacts and investigate the reason why your faction is on the Ark.\nGame Overview and Key Features\nAsymmetric Factions and Custom Meeples. The player boards are double sided and you can play on A-side which is the same for all factions; or the B-side that offers asymmetry. There are custom meeples for each playable faction and also custom meeples for the neutral factions. \nPrototype Image\nRooms that break the game rules. In the Ark there 30 completely different rooms representing different modules/parts of the space ship. Each room provides a different benefit to players, and some rooms, allow players to break the game rules. \nA choice to compete or collaborate. A competitive game where it makes sense to collaborate? Every room of the Ark can be used by more players or it can be hacked to be exclusively controlled and used by one player. In Ark: Awakening there are no alliances between players. Two players might cooperate in one room and fight for control in another room. It is a free-for-all, it is a puzzle to solve - should you build upon other's work, should you be aggressive and compete for exclusive control, should you collaborate? The game does not push players to fight or collaborate ... it just provides these options and players play the game as they want. Players themselves decide how to win. \nTailored for both cautious and aggressive players. Players can develop their faction inside the safety of their biodome, hence avoiding interaction with other players; or players can venture \"outside\" to gain better benefits but also they would be risking conflict with other players. Combat exists only as an option to accomplish a mission. There is no conflict for conflict sake and usually players can complete their mission using other means than combat. \nPrototype Image\nGreat Replayability due to the asymmetric factions, random missions, random rooms and random board setup. The game has 33 different mission cards and each game each player draws a random one. \nClick to Enlarge\nIn the Ark there are 30 completely different rooms representing different parts/modules of the Ark. Each room is unique and can be utilized differently. And each game you play with only half the rooms, returning the rest to the box for another play. \nAnd last, due to the random setup of the modular board, each game will offer different opportunities to play. The modular board is constructed as you play - see in \"Warp 9\" speed on Youtube.\nTabletopia Image - Guardians Mode\n\"The Guardians\" is a solo and co-op mode against a player or an automated opponent. Due to your meddling in the Ark\u2019s systems, a defensive measure was activated \u2013 the Guardians. Now these scary looking blue robotic meeples are traversing the rooms, attacking anything alien and disintegrating any cube or cylinder you have worked so hard to place. The Guardians movement is determined by a die, so players are never sure where they will show up. Players will try to accomplish their mission while avoiding the Guardians, they must cooperate and build upon their choices, synchronize their play to perfection in order to win. But, be careful - the Guardians monitor all communication! In this scenario, 1-4 players can play against an automated opponent or 2-5 players can play co-op from which one player will take the role of \"The Guardians\". In case one player of your gaming group does not like heavier games, they can take the \"The Guardians\" role, as its mechanics are very straightforward. Read our blog or for more and you can demo it on Tabletopia. \nTurns are fast. Player turn is very short, usually while handling the effects of your action, the next player has already taken the action. With up to 3 players there is almost no player idle time. Game lasts around 15-30 minutes per player. See our 2-player playthrough in 30 minutes!\nIs 15-30 minutes per player too much? No worries - there is a Short Game variant that makes it easier to accomplish your mission. \nIs this Game right for You\nYou are a veteran board game player and you like playing heavier games.\nMany interesting choices, but you can only make one per turn reducing analysis paralysis. \nNo Victory Points, no second place. The player that finishes their mission fastest wins and the game ends.\nEach game is somewhat of a puzzle to solve - what actions to take in order to minimize the number of turns needed to finish your objective.\nLuck plays a very small role in the game. Only the drawn artifact cards and how the board is constructed are random. The most efficient player will almost always win.\nYou will be head down on the board, trying to play more efficiently. \nIf you do not like most of the above things, then this is not the right game for you. We would rather have a few happy backers than many unhappy ones. Please spend your money on another Kickstarter project - there are a lot of good ones to explore. Otherwise, scroll down - we want to convince you that this project is worth your time!\nInside the Box\nUnboxing for Ark: Awakening, a demo version that was sent to reviewers. Note that the demo version shown on the video contained only 4 out of the 6 groups of special rooms and components for 3 players instead of 4 in the Standard Box and 5 in the Premium Box. Additionally, the meeples in the shown demo version were acrylic and with the same shape. The Standard and Premium Boxes will have wooden custom-shaped meeples. \nAdd-ons\n You can add all add-ons to the Standard and the Premium Box. \nAfter months of work, the engineers managed to break through the \"Sealed Section\" of the Ark. What lies behind those doors? => Neutral Factions and Side Missions and 2 New Playable Asymmetric Factions - Raghna and Qfin. \nWhen a player encounters a biodome belonging to a neutral faction, they will see, in secret from other players, a random objective related to that neutral faction. If the objective is fulfilled, the player receives the neutral factions unwavering allegiance and gets a huge benefit. This benefit potentially can be a different action that can be taken each turn in addition to the 7 basic actions \u2013 like changing the place of two rooms, turning off the energy in the entire Ark, blocking rooms to prevent movement, sabotaging the opponent\u2019s weapons supply, etc. But, pursuing the objective is risky, and do you really want to jeopardize your main mission to do a side quest? What would you do?\nSee \"Sealed Section\" Factions sections for more info about Raghna and Qfin.\nStretch Goals\n(replacing the Cardboard Tray)\nLanguage and Language Stretch Goals\n The game will be available in English, but we want to make our game as accessible to people as possible. So, the game's rulebook will be available on multiple languages as a digital copy to download. We are already working on the German translation, and next are French, Spanish and Italian. \nClick to Download\nClick to Download\nThere is also a language pack add-on which you can add to you pledge. See \"Add-ons\" section. \nAdditionally, if there are more than 500 backers on Kickstarter that select a specific language, the game will be also produced in that language (rulebook, cards, etc). If you have pledged, do not forget to select your preferred language. \nClick to Select Language\nOnce a language passes the 250 backers mark, we will add it here as a separate stretch goal with a backer counter updated daily. \nClick here if you have pledged for a German version\nEven if a printed game is not available in your preferred language, we made sure that it is language agnostic and can be enjoyed without understanding English. A rulebook in multiple languages will be available to download. On the printed components, text is only found in 3 places: \nas card titles, to add flavor. E.g. \"Warp Engine\" \nthe mission cards have text explaining the story and motivation behind the mission objectives. E.g. \"The cryogenic sleep has been hard on Mother. We need to ensure her speedy recovery!\" This is only for the sake of theme ... players do not need to understand the motivation to play and on the mission cards there are icons explaining how players can accomplish the objectives.\nthe artifact cards have a one-time use that is explained both with an icon and with text. The text is there so new players do not need to lookup the icon in the reference sheet.\n\nSocial Achievements \nHelp is get the word out by sharing/liking/following on Facebook, Instagram, Vallor and BGG. \nClick to Follow on Instagram\nClick to Share\nWhat People Say\nFor some reason embeding does not work for this Youtube video - Click to Watch\n\nPress\nbrettspiel-news.de\n solitairetimes.net \n spielbar.com \n Tantrum House - Feb 2020 (2nd half) Board Games Launching Kickstarter \n GloryHoundd - Kickstarter board games February \nWhy Pledge Now\n Kickstarter exclusives.

As a backer you can influence the final product, both through funding stretch goals and your valuable feedback through surveys. Every pledge counts towards unlocking more stretch goals and getting more in the box. \n Limited Supply. The game will not go through normal distribution channels. There will be limited copies of the game produced and it is possible you will not be able to get a copy of the game if you wait for retail. Actually, there is a very real possibility that the game may never be available at retail outside of retailers who choose to back here. \n Warp Travel. You will receive your copy first. \n Discounted Price. You get this game well below the retail price. After the Kickstarter campaign ends, we will no longer offer the same discount. \nNew to Kickstarter?\nKickstarter provides a funding platform for creative projects. When a creator posts a project on Kickstarter, they\u2019re inviting other people to back a project (pledge for project), in return for receiving a reward. Projects last around 30 days at which time people can pledge for a reward. \nWhen you have pledged for a reward: You\u2019re only charged if the project reaches its fundraising goal. You\u2019ll provide your payment information when you pledge, but you won\u2019t be charged. Your payment will only be collected if, at the time of the project\u2019s funding deadline, the project has reached its fundraising goal. You can also change your pledge to a different level or cancel your pledge at any time before the project\u2019s funding deadline.\nWhen a project is successfully funded, the creator must complete the project and fulfill each reward. \nThe above is only a short summary, for more details go to Kickstarter basics, How Projects and Funding Work and Accountability.\nGroup Orders\nIf you are interested in ordering 20 or above Premium copies of the game, please write to contact@skyportgames.com. Please note that we are only able to offer a very small discount as our Kickstarter pledge prices are already quite low. \nGame Mechanics\n\u201cArk, Awakening\u201d is a hybrid worker placement and area-control game with engine building mechanics. During the gameplay, the central board is constructed by placing tiles (rooms) next to each other. In each game, each player receives a unique secret mission card. The first player that accomplishes what the mission card says, wins the game. \nChoose one of 7 Simple Actions Each Turn\nArk: Awakening is a action selection game. Players take turns clockwise performing one action out of 7 basic actions: move, integrate, route power, exploit, awake new units, militarize or research.\nPlayers will do much more thematic actions - like hack the main power generator, upgrade their biodomes, fully integrate rooms, activate rooms, steal energy, teleport, re-architect the Ark, etc, but these actions are all accomplished by performing the core 7 actions. \nFactions\nIn Ark: Awakening you can play asymmetrically on the B-side of the player boards. Each faction is different, with different actions on their player board and different special powers.\nIn this video series the designer Zharko gives an overview of the alien factions Hara, Diruni, Pajak and Gimli - their mechanics, special powers, and how playing them feels like. If you are interested in more detailed overview of each faction, you can read the Rulebook Appendix (F) for Factions. Note that the rulebook is still in progress and some things might change due to the balancing of the factions.\nAnd last, a survey Which Faction do you like best? In case there is interest, we will do another live session with a backer, playing the top 2 factions against each other! You can register here.\nPremium Box Factions\nIntroducing the 5th and 6th faction that are part of the Premium box - Eiilis and Togach. \nAdapting the living environment. When faced with the Eiilis it will be clear that the danger does not come from direct attacks. Instead, the Eiilis adapt the Ark to become more like the their biodome, essentially killing the other Ark's inhabitants in the process.\nOnly 12. No one has seen a Togach, but based on dealings with their emissaries, it is almost certain that there are and there have always been only 12 of them. This explains their secrecy and hiding as necessary in order to not put any of them in danger. They stay hidden bellow their empire of industry, using range weapons to defend against attackers.\n\"Sealed Section\" Factions\nIn addition to the neutral factions and side missions, there are 2 additional playable asymmetric factions in the \"Sealed Section\" expansion. \nLearn the Rules\nIf you prefer to learn by example, see a playthrough of the First Mission - it is a tutorial mission to help you learn to play by going through the basics. For an detailed look at the rules, read the rulebook. Note that the rulebook is work in progress so please do not upload it to BGG.

This means that backers from these countries will not incur any import taxes or VAT. \nThe standard box will weigh around 1.7 kg (3.7 lb) and the premium box will weigh around 2,2 kg (4.8 lb). This weight does not include any unlocked stretch goals. \nAfter the Kickstarter campaign ends, we will send you a survey where you can provide your shipping address, based on which your shipping will be calculated and charged. Please note that the below are only estimates. The final shipping costs will depend based on various factors like inflation, the final weight of the packaged game, the number of copies shipped to the same address and the number of copies shipped in a region, more copies meaning reduced shipping costs. \nFor details per destination see shipping costs per destination. In the linked document you can also find info for 2 and 20 games (group order) delivered to the same address. \nSpread the Word to help with our Campaign\nAs we are first time publishers it is difficult to get the word around about us and our games. Helps us do that by sharing/following/liking/subscribing on social media.\nFor updates your can also subscribe to our Youtube channel or our blog: \nWe also have an available Media Kit. For any inquiries you can write to us using contact@skyportgames.com or on Facebook. \nAbout Us\nSkyport Games was founded with the intention to create challenging, exciting and unique experiences to board game players everywhere. We put a lot on emphasis not only to the visual appeal, but also to the core of our games, making them versatile, offering multiple levels of difficulty and more than one playing mode, so that players from different calibers and with discerned playing styles can enjoy our games. Hopefully, we can extend our enthusiasm for our games and you can first hand enjoy our creations, made with hard work, love and stride towards the highest quality possible. \nFor the beautiful images and iconography see credits.

We are a small company, but we are completely devoted to providing you the best product and service as possible.\n\nThis is not a pre-order. The final version might be different than the version shown during the campaign. Having said that, the product is 90% complete, we already have all the art that we need for the game paid and delivered. We have also play-tested the game extensively. What remains from the development are:\n * some improvements to the graphic design to make the important parts pop up and, e.g. the numbers, cylinder and cube placeholders on the room cards.\n * minor balancing between the factions. \n * play-testing some of the newly unlocked stretch goals.\n\n\nFor the post-campaign tasks we will be partnering with the best fulfillment and game manufacturing companies. After the campaign ends, we will finalize these partnerships and you will be the first to know. \n\nYou will get timely updates from us about the progress and we will always be upfront about the status. \n\nRISKS\nAs with any Kickstarter tabletop project, the largest risk is a delay in the delivery - issues with manufacturing, freight shipping, and fulfillment logistics. \nIt is unlikely, but even with well known manufactures and fulfillment logistics, mistakes are made and your copy can have a missing or damaged component. In this case, please let us know at contact@skyportgames.com and we\u2019ll address the issue. \n\nREFUND POLICY\nDuring the campaign you can always cancel your pledge. \nIf you request a refund within 14 days after the Kickstarter campaign ends, all fees will be refunded - including Kickstarter fees.

It was an amazing experience going from concept, to prototype, to mass production, to successful fulfillment. We are applying everything we\u2019ve learned from our 1st campaign to orchestrate what we hope will be an even smoother campaign with the expansion and re-print.\n\nWe are proud to say that both the base game and the expansion are 100% finished. Everything from the art to the components to the rules has been carefully thought out, tested, and re-tested. Because we want to make sure that Rival Restaurants is being produced and delivered at the highest possible level, we are continuing our partnerships with some of the biggest names in board games: Panda Games, Quartermaster Logistics (US & Canada), GamesQuest (Europe), Aetherworks (Australia/New Zealand) and VFI (Asia).\n\nWe know and recognize that some things will always be outside of our control. However, we remain resolute in making it our #1 priority to make sure that the game you are delivered is of the highest quality.

You will earn Production Points (PP) for performing various actions in the game, and the player with the most PP at the end of the game is declared the winner.\nVehicles moving down the assembly line\nElectric Vehicles (EVs) have become more common since 2014. EV\u2019s are the future of the automobile industry. They are superior vehicles due to being more efficient, easier to maintain, cleaner, and are cheaper to run. They are computerized machines that use AI to improve safety and in the near future will provide autonomous driving. They receive software upgrades during their lifetime and are constantly improving, unlike their traditional combustion engine counter parts, which start to become obsolete as soon as you start using them.\nEach car model can be upgraded by various parts\nOver the course of the game, players take on the role of novice supervisors, trying to secure their careers. You will need to manage suppliers and supplies, improve and innovate automobile parts, and get your hands greasy on the assembly line in order to boost production and impress the factory manager.\nBlueprints can be claimed from the Design Department\nYou must make shrewd use of the recycling facilities and the limited factory supplies in order to appropriate parts when the suppliers come up short. Because the factory must run at optimum efficiency, production doesn't wait for you, or for mistakes.\nSandra, the factory manager, will review your performance and keep the factory on tempo\nThe Eagle-Gryphon Kanban EV Deluxe version of this critically-acclaimed game improves on past editions by providing:\n All-new artwork and graphics by Ian O'Toole to improve both the visual aesthetics and the functional play of the game (e.g. the beautiful and all-new board layout and display!)\n 5 different models and \"paint jobs\" of the 5 wooden vehicles AND the possibility to add-on a complete set of 40 metal vehicles \n A solo game version designed by the master of solo game versions -- David Turczi \n A brand new SpeedCharger expansion created by Vital Lacerda\n A new approach to the Boardroom (and its chairs) which streamlines play in that area of the board by using wooden Speech Tokens -- creating a cleaner implementation of this mechanic\n Lots of other great 3D wooden bits instead of 2D cardboard tokens (e.g. see below the Certification, Production Cycle, Meeting, Banked Shift, and Car Part Value Markers; Worker and Sandra Meeples; Player Locks and Car Parts; and Book and Parts Voucher tokens)\n Dual-layered, spacious and well-organized Player Boards \n A silver-painted Metal pace car (Stretch Goal)\n A Special Garage Tile Expansion (Stretch Goal)\n New (and extra) Final Goal tiles (Stretch Goal)\n A new and better laid-out Rulebook, Reference Book, and Player Aid sheets \n Rules Changes from Previous Editions:\nYou may no longer replace Cars in your garages with new ones.\nWhen Sandra penalizes you, you now lose 1 PP in addition to PP for any Banked Shifts that you have below 5.\nIn the Nice Sandra variant, you are only rewarded PP for Banked Shifts you have over 5, instead of for all of your Banked Shifts.\nThere are 3 new Final Goal tiles to choose from during Setup. \nThe new Board Room with Speech tokens for a cleaner implementation\n SOLO Mode by David Turczi\nKanban EV Solo cards\nIn the Kanban EV Solo Rules, you\u2019re the new hire at the company and your productivity will tightly watched. Any sign of slacking behind and you\u2019ll be terminated. Worse, the senior engineer Mr. Lacerda and junior architect Mr. Turczi would rather you don\u2019t make the cut, and will be trying to outperform you every step of the way.\nSPEEDCHARGER Expansion Now Included! \nThe SpeedCharger expansion provides players with persistent special abilities they may pay shifts to unlock.\nDuring setup, place 4 SpeedCharger tokens per player in a supply next to the Game board. Each player receives a Charging board which is placed next to their Player board.\nWhen working Shifts in R&D (or indirectly through Administration), you may spend 1 Shift to take a SpeedCharger token from the supply and place it on a space of your choice on your Charging board. From now on, the covered bonus is active for the rest of the game. Also, at the end of the game, each Charger token is worth 1 PP for each Car in your garages.\nFor example: If you have 3 cars and 4 SpeedCharger tokens, you score 12 PP. \nYou can only take one SpeedCharger per turn.\nThe Bonuses when played in...\nR&D - Once per turn, you can upgrade 1 Design with a Car Part from the supply.\nAssembly - You may ignore the restriction of having to provide upgraded parts first.\nLogistics - You bank 2 Shifts instead of 1 when placing a Kanban card.\nDesign - When you take a Design from the Central Design Stack, gain 1 Book.\nAdministration - When working in Administration, you receive 1 extra Shift.\nKANBAN EV Rulebook\nClick for Draft Rules\nALL the wood components in Kanban EV!\nNow that Kanban EV has 10 images on BoardGameGeek.com with 500+ thumbs, we are ADDING a Metal Pace Car, produced the same way as our 40 Metal Vehicle Add-On Pack cars, to the game in addition to the wooden pace car.\nNow that Kanban EV has at least 1,000 'Fans' on BoardGameGeek.com, we are adding additional Final Scoring tiles to the game. We do not yet have an exact number of how many tiles this will be, but we will fill the remaining space available on the punchboard with additional Final Scoring tiles to increase the variability of the game.\nNow that we have added 1000 New Subscribers to our Newsletter, the Special Garage Tile Mini-Expansion will be included in the Kanban EV KS Edition.\n\nNow that we have 500 retweets of our Tweet about Kanban EV, we will expand the SpeedCharger Expansion (see below) to include 6 new Meeting cards and 4 new Final Goal Tiles. \nNow that we have 500 shares on Facebook, we have INCLUDE the SpeedCharger Expansion (see above) in the Kanban EV KS Edition!\n\n\nThe following Add-Ons will be available in the CrowdOx pledge manager after the conclusion of this Kickstarter campaign on February 21. We expect the CrowdOx pledge manager to run from February 24 through March 20, at which time all add-on purchases must be made.  Please do not add funds for these Add-On items to your pledge now -- you will pay for them and shipping for this KS campaign when you complete your pledge manager.\nForty metal cars in the same dimensions as the wooden cars for the game. 8 per vehicle type.

Mariana Vit\u00f3ria de Bragan\u00e7a (1718\u20131781)\nOnce the King was unable to reign, the Queen became the regent.  Mariana Vit\u00f3ria didn\u2019t like the Marquis de Pombal because of the way he handled the Tavora affair, in which a  noble and powerful family that were friends of the Queen were accused of attempted regicide, and then executed in public by the Marquis, without a fair trial, purely to gain political power. In 1777, immediately after the death of the King, she dismissed the Marquis by Royal Decree and exiled him to his hometown, Pombal. \nPaul Grogan of Gaming Rules! hosted a live Q&A with Designer Vital Lacerda on February 6th, 2020, but you can watch the recording of this livestream in the video above.\nGaming Rules! overview of the original edition of Kanban:\nThe Official How-to-Play Video for Kanban EV will be created by Paul Grogan, and will appear on Gaming Rules!\nHeavy Cardboard's teaching & playthrough video of the original edition of Kanban:\nClick to Launch KANBAN EV on Tabletopia!\nElectronic Vehicles in the Production Queue\nVital Lacerda has designed a prolific list of euro strategy games including On Mars, The Gallerist, Vinhos Deluxe, Lisboa & Escape Plan.

In addition, if any part of your order cannot be delivered, then we will reimburse you the full cost of this component of your order regardless of the date.\nIf you apply for a refund more than 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter, we will only be able to refund 80% of your pledge. The difference is the amount of the unrecoverable fees paid to process your order through both Kickstarter and Pledge Manager. NOTE: Once the games have shipped from China towards our fulfillment centers, refunds may no longer be available.\nDual-layer Player Boards, wooden Lock tokens, wooden Speech tokens, and Design tiles\n Our estimated delivery date is November 2020 \nPlease note that this is an estimate and there are many factors that are beyond our control, such as virus outbreaks, holidays, customs inspections, factory quality control, inclement weather and dock strikes - to name just a few (all of which we have experienced in the past). Please understand we have little to no control over such factors. We assure you that you will be the first to know about any developments about production and shipping as we learn them.\nPut simply: you will get everything we promise to you when you pledge to one of our Kickstarter projects, and it will be delivered to you in as timely a manner as possible.\nShipping issues are relatively uncommon, but they do sometimes occur. We double check the external packaging of your games for damage before sending them to you. However, there is a chance that your games may get damaged during shipping by the carrier. If your package is damaged, please contact us at kickstarter@eagle-gryphon.com so we can assist you. \n\nPlease do not add any estimated shipping expense to your Kickstarter pledge!  \nBased on lots of prior experience, we have decided to collect from you the actual shipping cost for Kanban EV, and any add-ons you want to order, during the Crowd Ox pledge manager period -- which will be open from February 24 through March 20, 2020.  We believe that this is the fairest and best approach, to both you as a backer and to us as the publisher.\nWe will ship your orders, en masse, to our Fulfillment Partners around the world: in Canada, Asia Pacific, EU, UK, Australia and the US.  Our Fulfillment Partners will then see that your orders are sent to you quickly and safely, regardless of where you live in the world. While we aim to have the shipments to each fulfillment partner shipped from China at roughly the same time, the speed with which each shipment reaches  its regional fulfillment varies, as does the speed with which each fulfillment partner can ship out all the pledges for their region. We  will try to keep you updated as to the shipping and distribution status in your region or country, but we must ask that you remain patient and respectful during the shipping and fulfillment process.\nNOTE: If the UK does not remain in the Customs Union, at the time of shipment any extra taxes and duties will be the responsibility of the UK backers. It is possible for customs fees and/or tariffs to apply to any country outside of the country of origin for the shipment and we are not responsible for these Custom fees, taxes, etc. It is simply not possible for us to know and anticipate these for you. This is true for countries such as Japan and Brazil among others.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP DIRECTLY TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan. We do have a Ukrainian shop (Geekach) that will order and send games to you (see more info on Geekach above).\nBelow we have included a chart with shipping estimates for the Factory Worker & Employee of the Month pledge levels (subject to change based on your country / locale and final shipping weight):\nPlease keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may vary based on your specific country and address. Weight changes, and any optional rewards/add-ons you choose in our CrowdOx pledge manager, may also affect actual shipping charges.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAt Eagle-Gryphon Games we stand by our products, but sometimes issues do happen.

All of those projects have either been completely delivered or are in production right now.\n\nWe will always do our best, through Kickstarter Updates, to keep you as informed as possible as to the status of your game(s).

Add $35 for each additional copy.\n Chiseled, Pigment, and Deluxe Meeples - $65: One copy of Chiseled; one copy of our first game Pigment; 6 solid hardwood meeples made in Vermont.

Limited to 8 backers! \nExpected Shipping\nSubsidized US shipping is included in Kickstarter with your pledge. Additional international shipping fees will be added AFTER the campaign in a pledge manager. This will allow us to account for any changes in shipping costs that may occur between the Kickstarter and fulfillment. The prices below are estimates made at the time of the Kickstarter launch for international shipping. \nWe are planning to partner with Greater Than Games, Spiral Galaxy, and VFI to fulfill Chiseled in the US, Canada, UK, EU, and Asia, so VAT will be covered by Copper Frog Games for these regions. If we can secure partners during the campaign to fulfill in Australia or other regions, we will update the expected price list above!\nStretch Goal\nMany campaigns lock additional content behind financial stretch goals, but we have decided to include everything designed from the get-go, so that you can be sure that shipping costs won't skyrocket, and that the game will be manufactured as promptly as possible.\nWe have only one stretch goal for this campaign: improving the cardstock of all 230 cards from white-core to black-core. If we reach 500 backers, we will invest in better, thicker cardstock, ensuring even more durability and snappiness. Share the campaign to help us reach this goal!\nRetailer Pledges\nGame retailers looking to back and stock Chiseled should pledge for 1 game at the normal $35 tier and email/message us your business info to proceed. We will work out the details for bulk ordering following the campaign, with final payment due when fulfillment begins. Your pledge will be considered a down-payment on at least one case of 6 games at keystone pricing with shipping included. As well, be sure to ask your distributors to pick up Chiseled for wholesale! We want to make sure it's available for you beyond the Kickstarter, and multiple retailers requesting a game helps us help you get it.\n Multiple Copies and Pre-Orders\nBackers interested in more than one copy of Chiseled will be able to pre-order them in the pledge manager following the campaign with the same subsidized shipping as during the campaign. Other pre-orders will be charged full shipping for their respective regions, so back now! Adding $35 to your pledge now will get you another copy of the game, shipped to the same address.

You seek balance to earn you the most wisdom, based on a shared pair of goals that changes from game to game. Turns are simple but deep; you simply move a tile from the Path into the Mountain, then collect surrounding tiles based on the collection pattern and the depth of your understanding of that element. Every decision alters the landscape, grows your understanding, and charts your path forward.\nThe Gorinto campaign will not have any Stretch Goals. The game will be produced at high quality from the start, and the game system is so tightly designed that added content of the sort that Kickstarter campaigns usually feature (new characters, scenarios, etc) are not really suitable. Gorinto stands strong as a finished project without the need to \"stretch\" into anything beyond what we are presenting here. \nThere are a few Kickstarter Enhancements that will make the Kickstarter Edition of Gorinto more deluxe than the (still gorgeous) version that will go to retail. Scroll down below the Game Elements to see what is special in the Kickstarter Edition!\nWhichever version you get (retail or Kickstarter), your copy will come with all of the amazing high-quality components described below, which support three modes of play:\nCompetitive mode: strive for individual Wisdom\nPartnership 2 vs. 2 mode: team up with an ally to succeed together\n\"Kitsune\" Solo mode (designed with David Turczi)\nGorinto's gameplay is simple. On your turn, you choose an element tile from the Path at the edge of the board, and move it on a straight line into the Mountain, stopping wherever you wish. Once the tile is placed, you will use its elemental collection pattern to gather nearby tiles... and the more understanding you have of that element (meaning the more tiles you have previously collected of the moved type), the more tiles you will be able to gather! Each element gathers differently:\nEARTH DIGS DEEP (Gather tiles from beneath the placed tile)\n WATER FLOWS WIDE (Gather tiles horizontally from the placed tile)\n FIRE BURNS HIGH (Gather tiles vertically from the placed tile)\n WIND BLOWS FREELY (Gather tiles orthogonally adjacent to the placed tile)\n VOID SLIPS BETWEEN (Gather tiles diagonally adjacent to the placed tile)\nYour purpose in gathering these tiles is to satisfy the two public and shared Goal cards which are set at the beginning of the game. Each of them describes criteria which will earn you wisdom at the end of each season if your Gorinto is balanced in a certain way. There are also two key elements that will earn you wisdom at game end for gathering a lot of them. Managing these considerations is part of your challenge!\nGOAL CARDS describe how you'll score at the end of each season. KEY ELEMENT cards grant you 2 points per tile of that type in your Gorinto at the end of the game only.\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarter launches with 1,400+ successful Kickstarter projects and over $500M raised in total.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery campaign comes with its own challenges.

There's always some tweaking to do. \n\nIt is always possible that delays occur while a game is coming to fruition.

Although we have budgeted 11 months to bring Gorinto to your doorstep, delays can change our timeline at various stages. Therefore this timeline is only an estimate. We are working to do everything we can to meet our goal of getting Gorinto to you by February 2021.\n\nWe will be using fulfillment partners from around the world so that we can ensure a fast and smooth operation.

We have asked several  designers like you to propose us something, so whomever designs the best  one is hired!\"\nMinigolf Designer is a competitive free form puzzle board game for 1 to 5 players that plays in 60 to 90 minutes (around 20 minutes per players).\nAn example of Hole made out of tiles\nIn Minigolf Designer, players will compete to collect tiles representing sections of minigolf holes, and arrange them the way they want to form a 9 holes miniature golf course. However, in the end the players will gain more or less victory points depending on certain aspects of their minigolf, and also depending on the number of people drawn on their minigolf.\nOne of the three Rulers used to present the tiles and hold the turn order\nTiles are proposed to the players ordered from the least to the most valuable tile (depending on the number of victory points that the tile provides), but this order becomes also the player's next turn order.\nThe game is simple and plays fast, as players do only one thing during their turn: pick a tile and place it on their minigolf design. After placing around 40 tiles, their minigolf is complete and players can score them to declare the winner.  \nExample of a complete minigolf course that a player can create during the game\nMinigolf Designer delivers a quite new player experience to board game lovers, mostly due to its free form aspect. The fact that you can create any design gives this feeling of freedom. You can actually play just by following your artistic creativity!\nBut it's not a purely artistic random placement of pieces either. The puzzle aspect comes from the challenge to assemble the tiles in a way that satisfies a bunch of preferences. However, there is no unique solution; with the 256 tiles present in the box, you can build millions of miniature golf courses!\nCompetitive players will also enjoy the game by trying to satisfy as much design constraints as they can, if not all (which is possible). There are 7 design aspects that could give you victory points, but none of them are mandatory. Therefore, both kids, casual players and competitive players can enjoy the game but in different ways.\n\"I personally like to play minigolf, and I always enjoy to discover the various obstacles every time I try a new minigolf. This was the triggering idea for this game. I thought the guys who design real miniature golf courses may have a lot of fun just to invent new obstacles and try to fit all the holes on the available space, in a logical manner. So I designed my game around this idea, and now we can experience the same fun.\" - Alban Nanty (designer of this game)\nSince this is our first publication, we do not have a network of retailers to get Minigolf Designer to a wider audience, which means this may be your best chance to get the game!\nPlease note that the final appearance of the game components may differ from the images above. \nThe minigolf tiles are 4 cm (1.6 inches) wide. The cards are in poker format (around 6 x 9 cm). The game box will be 30 x 30 x 7 cm (11.8 x 11.8 x 2.75 inches). The estimated weight of the box is 2.150 Kg (4.7 pounds) (with complete punch boards). \nOverview of all the different cards\nAs you can see the turn is very fast. Players will need between 36 to 40 tiles to complete their design, which means the players will play around 40 turns before the end of the game.\nThe tiles are presented to the players on a ruler (with one more tile than the number of players), but they are sorted according to their number printed on the back. When a player pick a tile, she leaves her pawn at the same place. The order of the pawns on the ruler becomes the next turn order.\nTherefore, the more victory points the tile you pick has, the more likely you will play last in the next turn, leaving you with less choice in the next turn. On the contrary, if you pick a boring tile, or even if you pass in front of everyone, you will be the first player to choose a tile in the next turn.\nSimple Version\nThe above explanation is the basic mode, suitable for kids, family and casual players. This is probably the version you will play for the first time, to get familiarized with the game.\nAdvanced Version\nThe game also comes with extra wooden disks and cards, to play a more competitive version of the game. In this version, the players follow the exact same rules as the simple version, but at the beginning of the game (and later during the game), players will have a chance to bet secretly on which aspect of their minigolf they will more focus on. At the end of the game, the players can gain extra victory points, if they are actually better than the other players for the aspect(s) that they chose. However, this is risky, because if they are not the best, they will loose points.\nSolo mode\nThe rule book contains also some rule adaptations to play solo. In solo mode, the player don't need the Rulers, but still draw 2 tiles during each turn, for choosing one. They can pass, meaning not choosing one of the two tiles, but that makes them loose victory points.\n Watch a full game with two players:\nFor non English speaking videos, you can always click on the CC button to activate the subtitles, then click on the Gear icon and choose Subtitles/CC > Auto-translate > English, in order to get the subtitle in English (or any other language you like).\nHere is a review of the game prototype that we sent to the Youtuber Maurice Lapierre. In this video Maurice presents you all the game components and gives his first impression on the game mechanics. \n Here is a complete rule explanation, and game component presentation from the youtuber D\u00e1maso de Damasco y sus distracciones:\n And a solo game from the same youtuber:\nUnlike many other board games whose illustration is made on computer, Minigolf Designer is really a game of art. Its original artwork was all paint by hand by our artist Gul. She painted 170 different tiles in 10 x 10 cm (3.9 x 3.9 inches) format, even if we knew that tiles will be smaller in the game (4 x 4 cm or 1.6 x 1.6 inches). \nExample of the tiles painted by the artist\nWe decided to give away those pieces of art, already framed in a modern and sober frame. If you pledge at the \"The Game + One Original Art Work\" level, you will receive a unique painting already framed and ready to be displayed on your desk. The pieces of art will be randomly distributed to the backers of that pledge level, therefore it will be a surprise to see which tile you received. You can then try to find the tile in the game and maybe even notice some difference if the tile has been edited after scanning. \n As we only have 170 painted tiles, we had to limit the quantity for this pledge level, so hurry up if you want your original art work!\nAn example of an original painted art work in its frame\nThe above picture is one of the possible tile that you may receive, but each available painting that we give away is different, so the image above is just here to give you an overview of the overall look, but the tile will certainly be different. The frame itself should be the one displayed on the image.\nThe painting size is around 10 x 10 cm (3.9 x 3.9 inches), and the outside frame is a bit less than 15 x 15 cm (5.9 x 5.9 inches).\nWe run this Kickstarter campaign through our company named Thematic Games. Alban has started up this company in 2015 for the purpose of creating immersive games and entertaining experiences. We believe immersion and story telling is what makes people dream, therefore we always pay attention to the theme of each game we create.\nFor this project we are also helped by Jerome Levy, an Executive Producer in one of the major Video Game companies, who helps us as an adviser for the Kickstarter campaign and the overall aspect of the project.\nFor more info on Gul's creative work, you can visit the Wenlin Studio website.\nAll shipping cost are paid up-front on Kickstarter.\nThe cost displayed in local currency in between brackets are just estimates, depending on the currency exchange rates at the time this page was created. Kickstarter will display the exact shipping cost added to your pledge when you click on a pledge level.\nYou may expect custom fees depending on your country (however in many countries, a low value item like this game is custom free).\nEach order will have a tracking number that we can communicate in case of excessive delivery time.\nFor certain countries specially expensive, we have set a specific cost not listed above (which may differ from the \"Rest of Europe\" or \"Rest of the World\" cost). In any case, you will see the shipping cost when you click on a pledge package, depending on your location.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis project is our first Kickstarter campaign, therefore we are learning and discovering all the Kickstarter process. Even if we read extensive testimonies and advice online on how to run a smooth campaign, we may encounter unforeseen situations specific to our project.\n\nDesign\nThe Design is completed, we have play tested the game many times, and not only with our families and friends, but also with strangers. We found those stranger testers in a bar where board game fans meet each week to play. The testimonies that you can watch at the end of the video are real testimonies from people we never met before, giving true feedback... they are not paid actors.\nWe are confident that the rules are solids, works well and don't need any more tuning.\n\nArtwork\nAll artwork has been 100% completed.\n\nEditing\n100% of the game components has been edited and prepared for production. The rule book is completed (you can download it above), and all the punch boards have been designed to optimize their quantity (there will be 11 punch boards in the box). All the cards have been designed.\n\nManufacturing\nWe have contacted two different game manufacturers, and asked for a quotation for the production of our game. Both gave a similar production price. We got some printing sample and pawn sample and are satisfied with the quality. Jun Ding, our production manager is a Chinese native speaker, therefore we don't have any communication issues with the game manufacturer and we can control the quality.\n\nShipping\nWe have asked shipping cost to two different transporters and we have chose one of them to end up with the shipping cost described above.

It also helps prevent hair from flowing through easily.\n- Skidproof Base\nGlossy finish increases the adhesive characteristics of the silicone material, ensuring that they stay firmly on the drainer. \n\u25bc Hair and debris can be easily removed. Rinse with water and it\u2019s as good as new.  \n\u25bc Anchoring points help stabilize the rim. \nHR-BIODCIDE silver ion particle can effectively eliminate 99.99% of bacteria, ensuring a bacteria and mold-free bathroom even under humid conditions.\n5mm anchoring legs stick firmly on the drainer holes, preventing the catcher from drifting when a large flow of water is encountered.

And researchers from the University of Alabama at Birmingham recently found that brushes stored in the bathroom\u2014a.k.a. all of them\u2014are contaminated with fecal germs, among other bacteria.\n\n\nUsing a cover on your toothbrush after brushing your teeth seems like a good idea but, actually, it's poor health practice. Moisture gets trapped within the cap keeping your toothbrush bristles from drying. This promotes bacterial growth.\nThe bathroom countertop is home to 452 bacteria per square inch, so if you leave your toothbrush on it, you\u2019re putting those bacteria in your mouth.  \nBacteria can spread from one head of a toothbrush to another when the bristles touch. If your family member is sick or has an infection, touching toothbrushes could spread their illness and germs to you. \n\n\n There are countless toothbrush holders and sanitizers on the market today but almost none follow the natural, easy and fast method of decontaminating your toothbrush. \nSensiFresh uses a brush-like pattern of silicone heads, housed in a protective holder to capture toothbrush handles of just about any size or shape.\nThese long, flexible (but durable) silicone finger-like structures easily grab toothbrushes and create an environment that isolates toothbrushes, preventing cross-contamination from other toothbrushes in the holder.                  \n\n\n\nOther holders are easily exposed to gargled water and toothpaste residue. Leading to the same contamination issues that you were seeking to solve in the first place. \nThe reverse toothbrush holder by Working K using an internal structure of silicon bristles that prevents contamination. \n\n\nContacts between toothbrushes can cause unwanted infection.\nThe cup also gets dirty from collected toothbrush water. Our device allows for the separate but concurrent holding of whatever you need: Toothbrushes, razors, toothpaste, tongue cleaner, even a comb without cross-contamination. \n\n\nCapping a toothbrush or putting it in a container ensures the toothbrush will never dry and worse, can serve as a breeding ground for germs.\nInserting toothbrushes upside down (inverted) in the SensiFresh ensures you are getting the fastest, most natural drying and decontamination of toothbrushes after use. The free flow of air, absence of cross-contamination bacteria make the SensiFresh the easiest, most natural way to store and dry your toothbrushes. \n\n\nSensiFresh is made of easy to sterilize dishwasher safe materials so you can keep it clean. Or use microwave or boiling water to thoroughly sterilize it. \n\n\nSensiFresh is space-saving and easy to install. Simply remove the strip at the back of the holder and place SensiFresh anywhere you want. \n\n\nSensiFresh is not only for toothbrush. Take it to your shower, kitchen, office and more. SensiFresh can do it all. \n\n\nFounded in 2016, Working-K has been working to improve the quality of human life by developing products that are essential, not just good to have. Through research and development, the company continues to march towards becoming a leading product supplier.\nThe new 2019 product, \"Reversed Toothbrush Holder\" will enable safe and hygienic use of toothbrushes that have been neglected.

We eliminated the attached output charging cable and went completely Wireless charging. We partnered up with a well known battery manufacture and created our own custom A type 5000 mAh battery. We also designed our own magnetic universal eco-system that is compatible with any wireless charging phone. Below are the specs so you may compare the differences between the two projects.\nIntroducing, Juice Card, Magnetic Wireless Power Bank by ex\u014d. Don't be fooled by deceiving bulky power banks claiming to be slim, ex\u014d Juice Card is currently the worlds thinnest magnetic power bank at 10.5mm at 5000mAh.

Having to carrying all of them at the same time can sometimes be a headache. How often have you left your cable behind by accident? Or too tired after work you forgot to charge up your mobile devices? ex\u014d has the simple everyday solution for all of these problems, so you can finally be free from all the tangled cables that bind you.\nMagnetic Wireless Charging\nex\u014d Juice Card is a certified wireless charging battery pack. That means, it's compatible with all Qi enabled devices, including your Air Pod Pros. With a battery capacity of 5000mAh, and pass through charging, Charge your device + Juice Card simultaneously over night and wake up to a full battery the entire next day.\nMinimal & Light\nex\u014d weighs only 134g. It's so minimal and light, you won't feel it there. Also, since it can charge your mobile devices cable-free, you'll  never have a tangled mess in your pockets ever again.\nSuper Fast Recharge\nex\u014d features Dual Qualcomm 3.0A Micro USB + Type-C port for super fast recharge. Equipped with Qualcomm 3.0 quick charge, works seamlessly with iPhone and Android devices at 7.5W power, respectively.\nCharge Two Devices\nex\u014d can charge up to two devices at the same time. One device wirelessly and the other device by the included cable through its output 3.0A Qualcomm USB-A port.\nCar Vent Clip\nex\u014d Juice Card has integrated the use of a car vent clip for hands free charging and driving. By strategically placing a magnetic contact point on the backside of the Juice Card, simply place the back of Juice Card + Device on the magnetic vent clip. Allowing you to wirelessly charge the phone and still able to view maps or other apps while driving.   \nSpecs\n Magnetic Wireless Power bank: Model JC2\n Capacity: 5000mAh (18.5WH) Li-Polymer                    \n Wireless Output:5.0V=1.0A                                              \n Output: 5.0V=3.0A (total 3.0A).                                                                                               \n Input: 5.0V=2.0A                                                                                                      \n Dimensions: 115mm x 74mm x 10.5mm | Weight: 134g                                                  \n Safety Certifications: CE, FCC, RoHS, UN38.3            \n Safety Systems: Overheat Protection | Overcharge Protection   \nUS PATENT: D825,456S   \nWarranty\nWhile many other Kickstarter campaigns end their job after shipments, we go a step further and offer a 1 year warranty that covers defects in materials, faulty batteries and any malfunctions after you receive your Juice Card. We have a very close working relationship with our supplier network in China and are very confident in our quality control procedures.\nDesigning & Prototyping\nFrom the beginning, we knew we wanted to make a battery pack that is minimal, light and compact, but powerful enough to be useful on a daily basis. Most importantly we wanted to share the portable power bank with multiple devices, We needed an innovative idea that can truly make people's lives easier.\nOnce we got the idea for a Universal true wireless battery pack, we jumped on this chance to design something that is perfectly balanced for beauty, utility, and most important of all, convenience.  \n Universal Compatibility \nTeam\nThe ex\u014d team is a small, self funded start up company out of Dallas, TX. Led by Atticus, who comes from an Architecture and design background. Creating unique useful products that make life easier has always been his passion. Our exclusive manufacture in Shenzhen China currently employ 10 super engineers that assist in all of our product creations, They have well over 20+ years in small electronics such as, power banks, headphones, blue tooth accessories. We are very familiar with the whole manufacturing process and we are in contact with them 6 days a week via Skype.\n Time Line \nWe've spent the past 2.5 years on developing the Juice Card and have completed many of the steps including tooling, and almost ready to start the manufacturing stage.

You have to make sure the risk is worth the reward. ex\u014d Juice Card is our 2nd product invention that has received a US Patent D825,456S. Our first invention was the ex\u014d wireless adapter for wired beats, US Patent 9,510,085. We have sucessfully sold this item on our own website and Amazon.com for the past 3 years. To limit the risks to Kickstarter backers, we have completed the manufacturing tooling before launching the campaign. The only other risk would be logistics, as shipping out rechargeable batteries has always been a safety concern. That's why we've taken extra precautions for safety certifications and also hiring a safe logistics company to ensure the safe delivery of all your rewards.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "High 5", "descp": "Get a big THANK YOU from our TEAM!

Sometimes we ignore it, sometimes we cherish it. \nBut why is sound so important?\nWe spend everyday hearing and listening, it is part of our lives.  Sound is influential, it can be informative, educational, conclusive, emotive, and many other things for us.\nThe problem is people remember only 30% of what they hear. Smartphones can do the \u2018work\u2019, they are certainly not built to be digital voice recorders. \nSo why not try the better solution?\nBorn from a team of researchers and engineers who spend many hours in front of a computer, TileRec is our constant reminder to take a walk and \"stop and smell the roses\", so to speak.\nWe designed TileRec to exceed even our own extremely high personal standards.  \n\n Thin: Only 1/4 inch thin. Fits easily in the slimmest wallets.\n Small: As small as a piece of a chocolate bar ( 2.48 square inch).\n Light:  The same weight as a US penny (0.5 oz).\n Simple: Simple everything! Easy to use, easy to recharge and easy to playback.\n Long-lasting Battery: 24 hours on one charge. Designed to be used the entire day.\n Surround Recording: 360 degrees recording in a 15 feet range. Meeting, lecture or simple discussion - all sounds are easily captured with HQ clarity.\n Resistant: 100% recycled aluminum casing. Sleek design that blends discreetly in the everyday setup.\nWhen we say \"World's Smallest\", we mean it. Measuring in at a staggering 1.6 inch in length, and 1/4 inch in height, weighing only 0.5 oz nothing else on the market comes close with the discreet portability offered by TileRec.  \nTileRec is so slim and small than it can fit almost anywhere you can think of. It blends discreetly with everyday objects - in your pocket or wallet, between the pages of an agenda, on your desk or even on your child's backpack.\nTraditional voice recorders were bulky and uncomfortable, limiting day-to-day activities.   \nThe idea of a voice recorder so slim and thin that it can be used as a  personal assistant is to improve the daily productivity of its user. And is practically indestructible.\nYou can drop it, step on it, even run the car over and then resume recording. \nThe aluminum casing ensures complete protection for worry-free use.\nWhen you combine these benefits with excellent audio quality, you get a voice recorder that is perfect for lectures, interviews, meetings, and dictations too! \nMost smartphones have a built-in voice recorder app that you can use anytime, so they can do the \u2018work\u2019, but certainly are not built to be digital voice recorders. \nSmall, discreet and efficient, Tilerec is the latest voice recorder designed by ATTO DIGITAL, created to encompass the ideal balance between form and function. \nSo, what makes TileRec so superior to smartphones when it comes to recording?  \nTileRec is perfect for anyone that wants to work simpler, faster and better \u2013 without compromising quality. \nTileRec is recording Hi-Q MP3, using a 128 kbps bit rate. You can choose to set it to record in continuous mode or in voice-activated mode to capture sounds in a 15 feet range (360 degrees).\nIn voice-activated mode, the ultra-performant sensor of the microphone will initiate ad start recording only when sounds are detected in the range of the recorder (15 feet) thus avoiding recording long silent periods and saving memory time.\nThe built-in Li-Po 3.7 V battery (240 mAh) needs only 1.5 hours to fully charge (DC IN 5 V 500mA), even when connected to a computer and will be up and running for more than 24 hours.\nRecord the entire day then just plug & play all your recordings. \n*no additional software needed\n TileRec can also record while charging so you will not miss any information that matters to you.\nLet\u2019s get nostalgic for a hot second. Reflect on a childhood memory, recalling an exact time or event \u2014 what you were wearing, who you were with, the sights, smells, tastes. Try to remember how you felt, specific noises like, I don\u2019t know, shrilling crickets layered under siblings\u2019 laughter or, the sound of your mother's voice.\nIt\u2019s difficult, right? Unless the event was recorded, the memory is likely pretty hazy.  \nTileRec is designed to record your daily meetings, activities, and ideas in a non-intrusive way and carries our belief that \u201cwear-ability\u201d is the utmost goal in the design of everyday carry technology. \nYou live in a fast-paced world where TIME is MONEY and you are searching for the best tool to improve productivity and save time?  \n Here are  some situations  TileRec can help you with:  \nThe perfect solution for professional use\nLawyers may use them to take voice notes while preparing cases, while criminal investigators record digital notes in the field, and doctors use it to record important info about cases. If you make a living in one of these fields, you may find a portable voice recorder invaluable.  \nUsing a voice recorder has never been easier. \nSo why not take the leap into the digital era? Stop wasting time and paper trying to keep track of all the information. \nJust slide one button to record and enjoy the Tilerec experience.\nUse the USB cord to connect your TileRec to any computer and select the audio file you need to playback.  It's just that simple: \nPLAY\n\nCheck on Soundcloud the audio sample recorder with TileRec.\nThe Li-Po built-in battery of TileRec is re-chargeable for more than 1000 charging cycles. It takes only 1.5 hours to fully charge the battery, then it can record continuously or in voice-activated mode, for more than 24 hours. \nHave you ever wondered how much paper we use yearly? \nAmericans use 85,000,000 tons of paper a year; about 680 pounds per person. The average household throws away 13,000 separate pieces of paper each year. \nUsing TileRec for your daily notes and meetings saves time, effort and also 1 tree/ person/ year from becoming paper. \nAll this while increasing productivity, saving time and keeping all your information organized with time and date stamp!\n\n Find a reward that works for you and your family, office or team, there's something for everyone.  We are particularly excited to offer fast shipping in the US and EU.\n This is ATTO DIGITAL's  2nd product launched via crowdfunding.  We always deliver. We've learned a ton over our first Kickstarter, helping develop a good sense of our capabilities and timeline.\nThe satisfaction of our users is paramount!\nThat is why we want to make sure that when you enter the ATTO  family you feel the care and support.\nOur Customer Service team is  24/7 available to offer support in more than 5 languages. And because we really do believe in the manufacturing quality of our recorders, we offer lifetime warranty for TileRec.\nWe, the ATTO DIGITAL team, have more than 10 years of combined experience in designing, producing and selling sound recorders and surveillance equipment.\nDownload Press Kit \nOur mission and passion are to listen, so it is also paramount for us to listen to our customers' feedback to better understand how the ideal mini voice recorder should be. \n Our team is ready - so is the manufacturing - now we just need you! \nIt has been a long adventure. From brainstorming to product design, engineering, and branding, it has been a trying, monumental amount of time, conviction and expertise.\nIt has been a stressful, exciting and thrilling experience to design a product from scratch. We want you to be part of our experience! \nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1000+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $430M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have been working non-stop the for last 3 years developing this product and we feel that the amount we are trying to raise is realistic with what is needed for fulfilling the project. We know that the Kickstarter journey is a long one and that there might be several surprises along the way - including foul weather, or maybe even (shock!) our phones running out of battery.\n\nUnfortunately, there are always risks involved in getting a product from the prototype phase to the market, but we have done everything possible to minimize these risks for our backers. Extensive planning has gone into the costs needed for raw materials, labor and shipping and we feel confident we will be able to meet our outlined delivery goals.\n\nOur biggest challenge is the timely delivery of all of our components. In order to keep TileRec at such a small size, parts must be assembled simultaneously, meaning if one shipment gets delayed, our entire process may get slowed down. Hopefully, everything goes according to plan, but if not, we have multiple suppliers for each component, always ready with a plan B!\n\nThe second biggest concern is quality control. While we are using the best manufacturer in China who was the previous supplier for one of the top international consumer electronic brands, we need to inspect each TileRec to guarantee 100% satisfaction. This dedication to detail is time-consuming, yet necessary to ensure a quality product.\n\nWe promise to keep all of our backers informed if anything happens or our timeline changes! If we encounter anything that might affect the product, its development, and/or shipping date, we will make sure to notify you about it with frequent updates. This project is our #1 priority and we will do everything we can to bring the TileRec to its full potential.\n\n_\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nThe TileRec has a rechargeable battery that lasts more than 1000 charging cycles.

You can increase the width of the Level Up by buying extra Centre Tiles \u2013 but make sure you buy enough extra side pieces to finish your table.  You can purchase extras by viewing the Add On Menu on the page below.  \nSome common sizes\nThe 2x4 Level Up (A 24 inch by 48 inch rectangle)\nThe 3x3 Level Up (A 36 inch square)\nThe 3x4 Level Up (A 36 inch by 48 inch rectangle)\nThe 4x6 Level Up (A 48 inch by 72 inch rectangle \u2013 for wargamers)\nReady To Level Up Your Game Night?\nAs fans of board, card and role-playing games, we often struggled on game nights to fit everything we needed onto our table. How do you fit character sheets, game cards, the main board, figures, dice and tokens on to a table that is also playing host to drinks, snacks, the compulsory game night pizza and a myriad of other items?\nWe have found the solution to your board game frustrations... the Level Up - a lightweight, portable, tabletop extension that raises the main playing surface, whilst still allowing plenty of space underneath for all your game night necessities!\nDimensions\nLevel Up is made up of 6 tiles which each measure 12\" square (30.48cm). The whole platform, when constructed, measures 24\" (60.96 cm) by 36\" (91.44cm) and stands at just over 6 inches from the table (16cm) \u2013 when complete, the playing area is just a little over A1 in size - further extension pieces are available in the stretch goals.\nEach 12\" square tile has been designed with reinforced rib supports to enable the level up to carry weight up to even the heaviest game pieces or the odd rogue cat. The Level Up has been tested by our engineers to 5kg (11lbs).\n\nWe have chosen metal for the legs for durability and strength but also so that they can be made as thin as possible, so as not to interrupt your view of the items underneath the Level Up. To ensure durability, threaded metal inserts have been added to the underside of each tile to provide proper thread engagement for the legs to be inserted into.\nThe design of the Level Up allows for the legs to be attached as close to the center of the surface as possible. This clears the underneath space for your character sheets and attached cards, dice, pencils as well as the ever-present danger of drinks. If stability is a worry, each tile will have three threaded metal inserts so that the legs can be attached as close in or as far out as you require.\n\nHow Sturdy Is It?\nThere have been a lot of questions regarding the question of stability of the Level Up.  We're pleased to say it's been tested to hold 5kg (11lbs)!  If you want to make it even sturdier you can add extra legs by adding to your pledge.  Please see the \"Add On Menu\" below!  \nPLAY\n\n\n  Every Level Up Comes With: \n(6) Board Tiles \n(6) Legs \n(1) Canvas Tote bag\nWhere table space is at a real premium and the games are competing for the same space with all the yummy fare that you are selling. Well, now your customers can have their cake and eat it whilst still playing their favorite game (other food items are available).\nWhether you are interested in level Up to use in the cafe or for your shop, please get in touch and we will send you a retail price list.\nAs well as creating the Level Up as a 6-piece, standalone product, we have some great add ons that will enhance the product.  Most came about as a direct response to suggestions supplied by you during our pre-launch campaign so thank you for that!\n\n Here's how add ons work.  Pick out your add on below.  Add that amount to your pledge.  For example.  Let's say you want the map clips and the upgraded bag.  Before we ship the product we will email you a survey and confirm your add ons and give you the opportunity to add more if you like.  \nAdd \u00a34 / $5 to your pledge and get a set of 6 plastic board clips.  Perfect for anyone using a battle mat or any rolled up surface.  Say goodbye to the days of having to weigh down the edges for a flat and smooth playing surface.\n Add \u00a34 / $5 to your pledge and receive a set of 6 extra legs.  Perfect for those who want to add extra stability to their board.  \nAdd \u00a312 / $15 to your pledge and get a set of 2 middle extension pieces and 2 extra legs.

We are ready to begin the manufacture of Level Up, all we need now is you to help us make this concept a real success.\n\nThis project has real potential to be massive. That being said, the bigger the project, the more links there are in the chain. With every additional link, there could be additional problems waiting to ambush the smooth planning of this project.\n\nWhilst we hope no problems will occur IF something was to happen, we can assure you that we will do all we can to mitigate any delay. Some difficulties, however much we might want to help, will be outside of our control.

We have chosen a superb team to support us in this project who want this game to become as much a reality as we do. This being said many of our team are sub-contractors working for several clients at the same time.

They have been well received. So well received in fact, that we are sold out.*\nThis Kickstarter is your chance to get some great games that you missed out on the first time around.\nOn Tour is a route-building roll-and-write game. You are the manager of a band, planning your summer concert series.\nEach turn, based on the dice roll, you will write numbers in two states. The cards will restrict where you can write them. These numbers represent what day you can visit that state.\nAt the end of the game, you will draw a route connecting as many states as possible, but never going back to a smaller number. If you visit more states than your friends, you win.\nThis is one of those games that seems simple at first, but it quickly becomes a real challenge. A real puzzle to figure out. The dice, plus some random setup rules make that puzzle different every time.\nPlays in 20 minutes. 1 to 8 players. If you get two copies, you can play an epic 16-player game.\nQE is the auction game where there is no limit to what you can bid. Literally. Every turn, a company is put up for auction and you are given a blank check. You can write any number you want on it. 5 or 5 billion.\nAt the end of the game, add up the points for all the companies you won in the auction. The only catch is ... you knew there'd be a catch ... at the end of the game, if you are the player who spent the most total money, then you lose.\nDoes that game really work? Seems broken. Is it fun?\nYes it works. It's crazy. It's fun. It's dynamic. You're playing the game, but you're really playing the other players.\n*We are 100% out of QE, but we still have a few copies of On Tour first edition left. If you prefer to order that to be shipped immediately, rather than wait on the Second edition from this Kickstarter, you can order it here.\nThe gameplay is completely unchanged from the previous printing. The components will look exactly the same, but we have made one improvement.\nSome people had problems with the dry-erase \"blank checks\" getting a little build-up on them and then not erasing properly after several plays. So we are switching to a different dry erase material. The new material is the same material that we have always used in On Tour with absolutely no problems.\nIf you have the original version of QE and are having problems with the checks (most people's copies are fine), we will replace your checks with the new ones at no cost if you email qe@boardgametables.com during this campaign so we can make sure to order enough extras.\nThe biggest complaint about On Tour was the size of the box. The new box will be about half as thick. Around 2 inches tall instead of 4 inches tall.\nThe cards, dice, and markers are the same. However, the maps are changing to be a little bit smaller, a little bit thinner, they will be folded in half instead of thirds, and won't have the decorative tape binding. They will still be plenty big and sturdy enough to play on. But making this change means we can fit 8 maps in a box that is half as small.\nThe first edition came with 4 maps, and the option to buy more. Second edition will come with 8 maps standard. That will fill up the box. If you want to play with more people, buy a second copy of the game and you can play with 16.\nEven more exciting, we are able to make all the maps two sided. The original USA map on one side and on the other side:\nA new wrinkle on the same game.\nThe European map has the same rules as the USA map, but the differences in geography create a different feel and strategy.\nThere are fewer connections on the European map (70 lines for 39 countries vs 89 lines for 41 states). However, it is easier to get from one side of the map to the other on the Europe side. The max distance between any two countries is 6, vs a max distance of 10 on the USA map. So on Europe, it is easier to zigzag around the whole board, but harder to wiggle around in close quarters.\nBoth maps and the cards for both maps will be in this edition.\nIf you already have the first edition of On Tour, you can pick up the expansion which includes just the boards and Europe cards (no dice, markers, USA cards, or box). The new maps will fit in the first edition box that you already have.\n\n Download On Tour Rules \\ Download QE Rules\nAll shipping will be charged in the pledge manager after the campaign. Please don't pay for shipping during the campaign as it will just make things more complicated.\nWe charge shipping after the campaign because it works better with our pledge manager, it is easier when people move before the rewards are shipped, it is easier for us to make sure people are paying for the correct region, it allows us to charge separate rates for Alaska and Hawaii, and it allows us to offer free local pickup.\nEmail help@boardgametables.com if you want to carry one of these games in your Friendly Local Game Store, if you want to offer them through distribution, or if you would like to localize them for your country.\nThe first printing of these games was not localized or in traditional distribution, but we are considering localization and distribution for this print run and would love to talk to you.\nChad DeShon is the designer of On Tour. Chad has been playing hobby board games for 14 years since discovering Catan in college. In 2014 he founded BoardGameTables.com. He likes heavy games like Age of Steam, Napoleon's Triumph, and Die Macher, and easier to learn games that have surprising depth like Haggis and Konig von Siam.\nGavin Birnbaum is the designer of QE. He combines his two hobbies, woodworking and game design. He designs games, and then makes them himself in his wood shop.\nAnca Gavril is the artist and graphic designer for On Tour and QE as well as Bites and Loot of Lima. She loves Food Chain Magnate, Pandemic Legacy, Blood Rage, and most of all Gloomhaven. Anca was recently featured in Board Game Geek's artist poster series.\nKaty Adams is the head of customer support at BoardGameTables.com and for this project. She likes Castles of Mad King Ludwig, Terra Mystica, Terraforming Mars, and worker placement games.\nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox.\nWe aren't trying to pressure or trick anyone into buying something they don't want. At anytime before your game has been shipped, you can email us and we will refund 100% of your pledge. No questions asked.\nWe have previously run 4 Kickstarters for board games.\nOn Tour - Estimated ship date January 2019. Delivered On Time for US backers. About two weeks late for European backers and about four weeks late for Canadian Backers.\nQE - Estimated ship date July 2020. Delivered On Time.\nBites - Estimated ship date January 2020. Currently on the train from LA to our warehouse. We will ship this game to customers in a couple weeks. About 2 weeks late.\nLoot of Lima - Estimated ship Date July 2020. Plan is to ship Loot of Lima at the same time as this Kickstarter. \nNone of the reviewers offering their opinions about On Tour or QE in the main Kickstarter video or in the screen shots on this page were compensated by us. Some of the reviewers were sent a free copy of the game so they could review it. \nTo clarify, the new printing on On Tour comes with the expansion already built in.

Connect it with your device and turn your screens instantly interactive. Project an invisible touchscreen near you and control a device that\u2019s far away from you.\nGlamos uses its rotating mirror module to scan its surroundings. It measures the distance between the objects and itself, transforms the data into a touch coordinate, and sends the coordinate to a display screen (like your smartphone or laptop).\nLiDAR sensors are widely used in self-driving cars (Check out the video below to see how it works). \nTraditional LiDAR sensors, however, are extremely huge and require a LOT of power. We developed the world\u2019s smallest LiDAR device with the least power consumption.\n\n\n\nWe had an opportunity to demonstrate Glamos at a coworking space in Santa Monica, and here's what happened\nWhereas most other sensors detect motions within a small range, Glamos automatically scales the size of the virtual touchscreen. The screen can be as small as your smartphone screen OR as big as 6 x 3 ft just like the one below.  \nMost sensors that use a camera can only capture a limited range of motion. Glamos can scan all directions without any limitations because it uses a rotating mirror module instead of a camera.\nPLAY\n\nProject a virtual touchscreen literally anywhere you want: on your wall, on the air, on a whiteboard - you name it! \nCheck out how you can use Glamos to create a touchscreen on different surfaces:  \nPLAY\n\nGlamos turns all your mobile games into a Wii game. Connect Glamos with your phone then project the phone screen on a bigger screen using an HDMI cable. Instead of playing Candy Crush on your tiny phone for hours, you can play it on a TV screen and turn it into an exciting social activity.  \n\n\nGlamos operates at 40Hz or 40fps, meaning its mirror module rotates and captures your motion 40 times per second. This allows your screen to respond to your movement as rapidly as possible- on laptops, you'll feel like your hands are an extension of your mouse cursor. \nMotion sensors tend to drain the connected device's battery super quickly. All you wanted was a seamless connection, and the next thing you know, you're left with 10% battery.\nUnlike traditional motion sensors, Glamos operates on minimal power and doesn't put a toll on your device. \nPLAY\n\nWhile experimenting with LiDAR technology at Samsung Electronics C-Lab, I saw the potentials of the technology. I wanted to create a LiDAR device that\u2019s smaller and more affordable\u2014a device anyone could use anywhere. I founded CoreDAR in 2017 to realize this dream. Ever since my team and I have been putting a large deal of effort and time to develop and test Glamos. \nAfter over 100 iterations and tests, we are proud to finally present the working prototype of Glamos. We are currently testing to make sure that it works with Android, Windows, and iOS devices without any glitch. \nWe are currently working on the final hardware design before we start mass production. What you will get as a reward will be even better looking than the prototype in the video. We will post an update as soon as we finalize our hardware design, so stay tuned!\nAltos Business Group is a business management consulting company that specializes in helping global tech startups launch their product in the United States.\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1000+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $430M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe want to make sure that we deliver products that are worthy of your unlimited support and love. \n\nWe have selected trustworthy manufacturing partners to ensure smooth production, but we might still face unexpected issues during the manufacturing or shipping process.

At home, on the train, on the plane. As the name says, Micro City is a small game about building your city. Several game modes, various challenges, different levels of difficulty and random distribution of districts will make each game different! \nBecause backing small, local publishers is cool! It\u2019s only thanks to you that we are able to publish this game. But come on, that\u2019s not all! Micro City embraces 4 keystones that make it a must in your game collection:\nWhat's more, Micro City is a complete package! All expansions are already in the box, no need to buy additional add-ons.\nMicro City started as a solo Print and Play game. You can be certain that this mode isn\u2019t just slapped on! Solitaire game modes are important to us because we travel a lot and aren\u2019t always able to find a gaming partner.\nThe first edition of Micro City was realesed as a Print&Play game in September 2018. It\u2019s a format that\u2019s  really close to our hearts (we have already released A4 Quest and Page Questthis way). We\u2019ve made it free for you and that\u2019s not going to change. The first edition of Micro City will remain free forever and the revised rulebook provides better and more streamlined rules.\nWe\u2019ve listened to opinions and remarks of players from all over the world. We\u2019ve worked hard preparing new modes of play, new challenges and add-ons. After a year we are ready to present to you Micro City Second Edition.\nYou are probably wondering why would you need the second edition if the first one is still available for free and will have updated rules available to all? Of course, you can simply support us as a thank you for the work we put into delivering free print and play games for you. But that\u2019s not the reason for this campaign. We have prepared several changes and additions compared to the first edition:\n Micro City is no longer a solo only game. We\u2019ve added two new game modes for 2 players. A cooperative mode and player vs player mode. The PvP mode introduces completely new cards and objectives which the players will fulfill during gameplay.\n   The artwork has been reworked adding more life to the city board. Now every district has it\u2019s upgraded equivalent so that you can feel your city grow and come to life!\n   We\u2019ve introduced the Logistics expansion which will be available with the base game on launch!\n   We\u2019ve added 2 challenge cards for the solo and coop modes.\nYou don't have to pay extra for expansions or additional content, everything is already in the box! Choose only if you want to have Micro City in physical version or in Print and Play format.\n\nShipping will be charged after the campaign is completed through the pledge manager. The shipping rates listed above are estimates and may change based on future shipping rates, but we will try to make the shipping cost as low as possible.\n\nShipping time for worldwide destinations is about 4-6 weeks for economic, basic tracked postage. All parcels will be sent from Poland. \nWhat\u2019s most important is that we\u2019re a group of friends who love board games. We love to play them, analyze them but also create them which we\u2019re getting quite good at. We\u2019ve been in the industry for many years both as Thistroy Games but also as designers and artists for other publishers.\nThanks to us games like Pocket Mars, The Valley of Alchemists, A4 Quest, Page Quest and Esport Manager have come to life.\nPeople behind this project:\nDo you have a question or would like to find out more about our other projects?

James built the first version of Vorpal Board to play the types of games he loves with his far-away friends and family. Currently working through the Gloomhaven campaign and loving every minute of it.\nMike Moede\nSoftware architect based in Madison, WI who brings his expertise building and managing dynamic web applications. Mike and James have collaborated for more than a decade building production software.  Likes to play Sushi Go! while eating sushi.\nThad Casey\nExperienced design engineer and entrepreneur with a focus on building manufacturing businesses, ensuring product quality, and on-time delivery.  Thad\u2019s company IMC developed the Manufacturing Incubator and helped build the Prototyping Center at the Tech Valley Center of Gravity in Troy, NY.  To his credit, he didn\u2019t laugh at the first homemade version that James showed him.  Still wishes he hadn't traded that Black Lotus.\nAfter moving from Madison, WI to Albany, NY in 2012, James found himself almost 1000 miles from his gaming group. Even worse, he had just received a Kickstarter backed copy of Zombicide and wished he could play with his friends. As a software engineer and stay at home dad at the time, James cobbled together some prototypes over the next few years that worked well enough to use personally, but he never considered anything more than that.\nIn 2017, two key events happened that supercharged the development of the platform: James pitched the idea to long time friend and collaborator Mike and a copy of the second printing of Gloomhaven arrived in Albany.  Over the next year, Mike and James improved upon and streamlined the software portion of the platform while James tinkered with the hardware. Many games were played and the potential of the platform came into focus.\nMoving from a homemade prototype to ready for production\nRealizing that they needed help and guidance on the hardware front, in 2018 James entered into the  Manufacturing Incubator at the Tech Valley Center of Gravity, a makerspace in Troy, NY.  Working in the Prototyping Center, James met and was coached by Thad as he designed and built the first production ready prototype. After finishing at the incubator Thad joined up to run the manufacturing side of the platform.\nThe development and marketing of Vorpal Board has been a major focus of our team for the last two years.  To take it to the next level, we need to be sure that the product resonates with the board game community.  The funding from this campaign will enable us to purchase raw materials at quantities that make manufacturing feasible. Additionally, we will be able to dedicate the software development time required to finalize that portion of the product.\nWe are extremely passionate about building the Vorpal Board platform and making it available to tabletop gamers everywhere. As an extension of that, we are hyper focused on our product meeting the needs of the hobby's most dedicated players.  We see Kickstarter as a way to connect with, get feedback from, and involve the players who are looking for a product like ours and would be early adopters.  Our intention is to involve backers in our development process as we finalize features and plan for future enhancement.  We look forward to working with the Kickstarter gaming community through this campaign.\nShipping\nIn order to be as transparent and fair as possible, we will be charging for shipping in a pledge manager after the campaign concludes.  We have worked with a number of carriers to generate what we feel are accurate shipping estimates to the following countries.  Please note these are only estimates.\nIf your country charges import duties, taxes, or VAT, you will be responsible for these upon delivery. Backer is responsible for all duties and taxes associated with the import of the products into your destination country.  Vorpal Board is manufactured in the United States and that will be the country of origin on shipments.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are a number of risks inherent in the development of software and hardware products. We have done our best to mitigate these risks by following an iterative design process and testing over numerous cycles. The software is currently in a playable state and the hardware has a production ready prototype. We have already identified our suppliers, manufacturing process, and done a mini production run to verify our assumptions.\n\nOur team has decades of experience in shipping production software and manufacturing complex products. We are confident in our timelines. However, unexpected delays can occur due to manufacturing issues, component shortages, and unanticipated events.

Shipping is really expensive and we have tried to come up with pricing that accurately reflects our cost to get the game into your hands without creating a logistical nightmare on our side.  Your shipping will be added in the pledge manager.  We expect that we'll have to come out of pocket a bit based on what we are charging and we are ok with that.\nTracking: We will also be using non-trackable shipments in some cases in order to save on cost as tracking can add 30-50% or more in some cases. So please understand if we do not have tracking with your package we did so knowingly. Rest assured, that we will get you your game and any risk associated with a package not being trackable is on us.\nDelivery time: While we would love to get everyone their games at the same time, it is just not possible. There is a high likelihood that some areas of the world will get their games before others. Our commitment is to get the games ready and printed as fast as possible (we've already done a ton of the prep work). At the factory we will break out the shipments to each fulfillment company with instructions to them that they should begin shipping as soon as possible upon receipt. In addition, because we have complete control over the U.S. shipments, you will not be able to order and receive the game on Amazon (or from any other US retailer) before our backers have it.   (Please note: Because of unexpected delays and other unforseen issues, we reserve the right to sell the game at major conventions, even if they have not been delivered yet).  The reason for this is that conventions are among the best form of marketing and therefore necessary to give the game the best chance for success.  One guarantee we will give is that if we do release anywhere before the backers receive theirs it will be at a price that is higher (usually significantly) than what was offered in the campaign.\nThe fine print stuff:\nWhat does \"Exclusive\" mean? You've probably noticed we do not say Kickstarter Exclusive but rather show a logo with our image (or another company image) and the word exclusive.  What this means is that these items will never be available in retail and only through us or the company depicted on the logo.  However, while they may be available from us in the future, they will most certainly not be given away for free.  In most cases, the cost of putting together the same package you might back in our campaign is 50% more or higher afterward.\nOther: Lastly, we will be using fulfillment companies in different parts of the world and while we have done our best to ensure we pick good ones, ultimately, once the games get into their warehouses there is little control we have at that point. We have always done our best to bend over backwards for our customers and if for some reason there are any issues with damages, missing components or missing shipments we will make it right. It just might require some patience.\nWhy back this campaign? While we have had great success with other games like Deception: Murder in Hong Kong and Champions of Midgard, we are still a relatively small company and we just do not have the funds needed to fund every project we do without some help. Your pledge gets you all the exclusive unlocked content which will not be available in retail... only through us.  Plus, if you live in the U.S the game will be in your hands before someone can get it from an online retailer.  Lastly, we expect the standard retail version of the game to be $99 MSRP, which won't get any of the cool exclusives that you'll get on this campaign.  If you live outside the U.S, we will do our best to get it into your hands first. Also, pledging helps get us closer to buying our company \"team building\" yacht.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a publisher that has brought more than a dozen games to market thus far, we feel confident in our ability to get this done.

Thankfully, I have talked to our warehouse in Iowa, and they have confirmed that the truck with our pallets of Tortuga have been dropped off, and they are beginning the process of unpacking everything and getting it set up for delivery.

The game also includes items you can equip to your heroes, 1V1 challenge cards, and roll modifiers to tip the odds in your favor.\nThe first player to slay three monsters or assemble a full party wins the game!\nAs part of this project, we created exclusive and collectible items that you won't get anywhere else as a thank you for supporting us on Kickstarter. These items will not be available online or in retail stores at a later date.\nPLAY\n\nIn Here to Slay, you'll start with a Party Leader and work to assemble a team of Heroes to take on savage Monsters. The first person to successfully slay three monsters, or build a full party with six classes, wins the game!\nEvery player gets to choose a party leader character to represent them throughout the game. Each party leader card has a class and a skill that gives you an edge over your opponents. Whether you enjoy fighters, bards, wizards, or thieves, you'll find a party leader that's right for your play style - but choose wisely, because you only get one party leader for the whole game!\nYour heroes are brave adventurers, ready to attack monsters and go head to head with your foes! The game includes over 40 unique heroes. Each hero card has a class and an effect, and each hero\u2019s effect has a roll requirement. In order to use a hero\u2019s effect, you must roll two dice and score equal to or higher than that effect\u2019s roll requirement. \nEveryone wants to be a hero, but are you brave enough to face off against these monsters? If you successfully slay three monsters, you win the game, but attacking a monster may come at a price! In order to slay that monster, you must roll two dice and score equal to or higher than that monster\u2019s roll requirement. \nBe warned: Each monster has a roll range in which they\u2019ll fight back, and if you score within that range, your party might be in grave danger...\nItem cards are enchanted weapons and objects that can be equipped to your heroes to bestow them with special advantages and skills. Most items give beneficial effects and are meant to be equipped to heroes in your own party, but a handful of items, called cursed items, can be equipped to enemy heroes to give them disadvantages. \nWhat would this world be without a little magic and mayhem? Magic cards are powerful spells with a one-time effect. Some magic cards can give you great advantages, while others are designed to set your opponents back.\nDon't like what your opponent just played? Throw down a challenge! Challenge cards can be played instantly to try to stop another player from playing a hero, item, or magic card. Playing a challenge card initiates a 1V1 challenge in which you and another player both have to roll the dice. If they win the challenge, they still get to play their card, but if you win the challenge, you get to send their card directly to the discard pile!\nOnly fools rely solely on luck. In this game, you can keep a modifier card up your sleeve (or, well, in your hand) to make sure the odds always tip in your favor. Modifier cards add or subtract from the final total of any dice roll. Whether you need to recover from a low roll or sabotage the high roll of an opponent, modifier cards can be a handy tool when luck doesn't seem to be on your side.  \nHere is a quick reference of the tiers (click to see the full spreadsheet): \nWe use BackerKit to handle all add-ons. Two weeks after the campaign ends, we send out a BackerKit survey, and you can select add-ons (and enter your shipping information). US backers can purchase add-ons with no additional shipping charges, and backers anywhere else in the world will be charged just a flat $5 (for any number of items you want).\nBecause Here to Slay has a strong role-playing element, we wanted to include a way for you to bring your own character to the table. So as part of this project, we launched a party leader customizer that you can use to instantly create your own character using artwork that we\u2019ve provided, or even upload your own.\nYou can also see characters that other members of the community have built - and the best part is, any custom party leader card that you create is fully playable in the game!\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind some of the best Kickstarter launches with 1,400+ successful Kickstarter projects and over $500M raised in total. They've been an amazing partner on this campaign and helped us grow our community! \nWhen our team first started working on Unstable Unicorns three years ago, we weren't really sure what to expect. We were huge fans of games, and some of us had even dabbled in designing games before, but we had never undertaken a large-scale project and seen it through to completion. The response was more than we could've ever expected, and it forever changed our work and our lives.\nFor the past few years, our team\u2019s mission has been to design highly interactive games that are worth playing over and over. We want our games to bring people together, to help players express themselves, and ultimately to make the world a better place. We learn so much from every project, and each piece of feedback we get helps shape the future of what we create. \nThe response we received on Here to Slay is nothing short of extraordinary. Your support means everything to us. We hope you enjoy what we create, and we will continue striving to delight you every single day.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile we are confident in the preparations we have taken for this campaign, we would be naive to assume that no risks or challenges lie ahead. With each new project we\u2019ve launched, we\u2019ve come across new problems to solve, and we expect Here to Slay to present its own unique risks and challenges that we\u2019ll have to overcome.\n\nThere are certain parts of the process we can\u2019t control. For example, sometimes packages get lost in shipping or held up in customs. That said, for each of these potential issues that we\u2019ve identified, we are working on risk mitigation strategies (such as keeping buffer inventory and building extra time into our timelines for international orders).

As you play, you make use of Trade to acquire new Ships and Bases from the cards being turned face up in the Trade Row. \nYou use the Ships and Bases you acquire to either generate more Trade, or to generate Combat to attack your opponent and their Bases. When you reduce your opponent\u2019s score (called Authority) to zero, you win!

Keep your cards organized with the dividers and held snugly in place with the foam block. \nAdd-Ons\nTo order an add-on, just increase your pledge by the appropriate amount. You will be able to specify exactly which add-ons you are getting using the pledge manager after this Kickstarter campaign ends.\nEnough Star Realms sleeves for the entire Deluxe Nova Collection with plenty to spare.\nNote: These Add-Ons are NOT foil cards.\n The Star Realms Universe \nIn the far future, the traditional governing bodies of the human race have been replaced with corporate leadership. Earth and its surrounding colonies are ruled by a group of corporations called the Trade Federation. The Federation\u2019s policies are focused around trade and growth, but especially on profit and prosperity for those at the top of the corporate ladder. While they prefer to deal with other star realms using trade and diplomacy, they have a large defense branch dedicated to protecting the Federation\u2019s trade and other interests.\nThe Trade Federation specializes in generating large amounts of Trade and in gaining Authority (increasing your score).\nThese mysterious creatures are the first alien life forms encountered by the human race. Most of the initial encounters consisted of human colonies being completely obliterated. On the few occasions that a Blob ship has been recovered somewhat intact, the only biological remains found inside have consisted of a gelatinous mass, thus leading to the moniker, \u201cThe Blobs.\u201d While for several years all encounters between humanity and the Blobs have been extremely violent, there is currently some limited trade between various Blob factions and some of the more-daring human traders.\nThe Star Empire consists primarily of former colonies of the Trade Federation. These colonies were on the outer edges of the Federation. Not only did they feel used by the corporations, but they felt the Federation failed to give them adequate protection from the Blobs. As a result, one ambitious colonial governor was able to unite several colonies into an independent empire under his control, one with a strong military, both for warding off the Blobs and for discouraging the Federation from trying to reclaim their lost colonies.\nThe Star Empire is a combat-oriented faction that draws many cards and makes the opponent discard cards.\nA cluster of industrial mining worlds were completely cut off from the Trade Federation by the Blobs. With the threat of annihilation by the Blobs always looming and no contact with the rest of human space, these worlds were forced to take drastic measures. Soon a cult of technology arose, focused on using advanced technology, robotics and computerization to create strong defenses and a powerful military that belied their relatively small population. Since their leaders believed their salvation lay in technology, technology soon became their god and their religion.\nThe Machine Cult gains most of its power from being able to remove undesirable cards from your deck and from having a large number of Bases designed to defend your Authority from attack.\nSpace is home to epic events and cosmic phenomena. Even the mightiest of starships seem insignificant in the face of Supernovas and Black Holes.\nEvents are a new type of card for your Trade Deck. Each Event card has a potentially game changing effect as soon as the card enters the Trade Row. After it has its effect, it immediately gets replaced with the next card in the Trade Deck.\nHeroes are forged in times of crisis when the fate of empires can turn on the actions of a single individual.\nHeroes are a new type of card for your Trade Deck. When you acquire a Hero, it goes directly into play instead of into your discard pile. Then the Hero awaits your command to rally their allies and give your turn a boost.\nIn the battle for space supremacy, a great admiral can be worth an entire fleet of ships. Just when your enemy thinks the battle is in their grasp, one final gambit can turn agonizing defeat into glorious victory.\nPlayers agree on a number of gambits, and each start with that many face down in play. On any of your turns you may reveal and use a gambit for a powerful effect. \nGambits can also be used to even the odds for players of varying skill levels. If you're a lot better at the game than your friend, but want a close match, just give them a couple extra gambits at the beginning of the game.  \nVideos and Reviews\nThere are many videos and reviews of Star Realms online. Here are a few:\nProject Notes\nShipping\nWe will be shipping to backers directly from fulfillment centers in The US, EU, Canada, Australia, and Asia.\nOur goal is to get product to our backers as soon as possible. When product arrives at one of our fulfillment centers, we will begin the process of shipping to backers in that region without waiting for product to arrive at other hubs. This means that backers in some regions may receive product before backers in others.\nIMPORTANT - For this Kickstarter you will be charged shipping separately after this Kickstarter concludes. This will be done via the Pledge Manager, which will be sent out spring 2020. What you are charged for shipping will be based on our actual cost to get your rewards to you from your region's fulfillment center.\nHere is an estimate of shipping cost by region. Keep in mind, this is just an estimate and cost will increase with add-ons.\nUSA (Contiguous 48): $15-$19\nAlaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico: $29-$59\nCanada: $17 - $27\nEU: $19 - $29\nNorway, Switzerland, Iceland: $39-$59\nChina, Macoa, Hong Kong: $19-$29\nRest of Asia $39-$69\nAustralia $25-$35\nNew Zealand  $25-$59\nRest of the World: $49-$89\nUnfortunately, we don't ship to Afghanistan, Brazil, Kazakhstan, Russia, or Ukraine.\nKickstarter Exclusives\nThese are exclusive items for Kickstarter backers, with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only. Kickstarter exclusives may eventually be remade with new art and/or language for general sale.\nThe Kickstarter Exclusive version will be forever identifiable by its original art and/or language.\nNothing is final until it is printed.\nAll art, materials, card text, and packaging pictured is subject to change.

That game was Dark Tower. We want to bring you that same sense of awe and wonder, pushing the boundaries of what a board game can actually do. After 3 years of painstaking work by a team of two dozen designers, engineers, and artists, we are thrilled to present to you a game with echoes of that long-gone wonder but ultimately unlike any game you've ever experienced.\nReturn to Dark Tower is a game for 1 to 4 heroes who undertake epic quests, fight fearsome foes, and test their mettle against the looming darkness of the titular tower. Now featuring both cooperative and competitive play. Designed by Rob Daviau and Isaac Childres -- designers of the two highest rated games of all time on Board Game Geek -- along with Noah Cohen, Brian Neff, and Justin D. Jacobson, the streamlined rules offer players difficult choices about when to advance their objective, gather resources, deal with threats, or level up.\nEach player controls a unique hero with their own starting inventory and special abilities. Along the way you gain helpful items, powerful virtues, and trusty companions to help you achieve your goal: Find a way into the Tower and defeat a powerful adversary.\nFiguring out the best way to utilize all of these assets is the key to victory. The game actively works to stop you, responding to your decisions and taking advantage of your missteps. Foes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, will stalk your hero and assault your buildings.\nOur innovative combat system leverages the power of the processor. Within the app, select virtual \"cards\" from each foe's unique deck, revealing the potential consequences of the fight. Then, use your hero's advantages to modify those results. Will you mitigate losses across the board, or focus on one to gain valuable resources for your effort.\nLooming over the board, the Tower itself is the greatest menace you'll face. Each turn, you drop a skull in, representing the threat of corruption. You decide where emerging skulls are placed, making those buildings less useful. At times the Tower itself springs to life, releasing trapped skulls in a single wave or revealing glyphs that sap your will.\nThe path to victory is fraught with peril. Battles and events can give your hero corruption. If you don't cleanse skulls from the buildings to keep them in check, the supply quickly dwindles.  \nTarry too long and face the risk of having all of the seals of the Tower break. Corruption, skulls, and time: Any one of these pitfalls can spell defeat.\nReturn to Dark Tower constantly presents new challenges. The adversary within the tower, the plan to access the tower, and the suite of foes you will face can mix and match in thousands of combinations. Play the same array over again or try something completely new.\nFor complete information on how to play, you can download the draft rulebook: \nOr check out this live playthrough we'll be doing on the Dice Tower:\nWe've also arranged for a how-to-play video by Rodney Smith of Watch It Played! at the time of release. \nCreated by a world-class team of designers and engineers led by Tim Burrell-Saward, an expert in technology-augmented games, the Tower itself is a game component without equal. From its very foundation, it's been devised to play an integral role in the game. Using a collection of magical-yet-reliable technologies, it generates game moments that simply wouldn't be possible without it. The Tower literally and figuratively dominates the table, drawing upon all of these powers to foil you. You will grow to curse its name.\nLearn more about the intense tower development and prototyping process in Tim's designer diary.\nThe game itself is rich and satisfying. But we have a few additional items in this campaign to upgrade your play experience even further.\nFor those of you new to Kickstarter, an \"add-on\" is something that's not included with a regular pledge. If you're interested in getting the neoprene board or any other add-on we might add to the campaign, it's really simple. You have two options:\nYou can manually add the amount of the add-on to your existing pledge. (For the mat, it's $45 including shipping.) If you have already backed and you go to the top of the campaign page, you'll see a button in the top right that says \"Manage your pledge\". Click on it and it will take to you a \"Change your pledge\". Then you can click on the \"Change your pledge\" button. Then, in the box with your \"Pledge amount\" you can manually add the cost of the add-on to your pledge. Click \"Continue\" and your good to go. (NOTE: You can also use this method if you want to upgrade from the Charge the Tower to the Azkol's Fortune level.)\nYou can add any add-ons in BackerKit (our pledge manager) after the Kickstarter campaign is over. I'll talk more about how pledge managers work as we get closer to the end of the campaign, but it might help to think of it as an online store where you \"spend\" the money you pledged in the Kickstarter campaign and where you can add new items too, like the neoprene board.\nThe Alliances expansion offers new rules and components to add further depth and variety to the game. It includes two new heroes, who can be used in any game. The Archwright fortifies buildings to protect the kingdoms; the Haunted Recluse dabbles in forbidden lore to powerful effect. Influence is a new resource that can be used to form alliances with powerful guilds or to thwart the capricious whims of the nobles. It also features new treasures and allies with more intricate abilities for experienced gamers.\nThe Dark Horde box contains stunning sculpts by Punga Miniatures of all the foes in the game. These figures bring the foes to life. (Keep checking back here as we unlock new foes and show off new sculpts.)\n The Coffers box replaces the cardboard resource tokens from the game and the Alliances expansion with top-quality, heat-transfer plastic tokens that have a great feel and durability.\n This 50mm diameter and 5mm thick metal coin signifies the active player. If you signed up for notification before the campaign launched, you will receive this for free if you back the kickstarter and get at least one copy of the game.\nSeriously, folks. This mat is huge and heavy. It's about 80% larger area than the game board. This makes the spaces larger as well of course, which can be a boon if you're playing with the miniature foes from Dark Horde. A real specialty item for those who want to play an epic game on an epic stage.\n Check out this rendered example of a gold foil art print:\nGive all your cards a little extra protection. This add on includes enough high-quality sleeves to cover the cards in Return to Dark Tower and the Alliances expansion. 110 standard card sleeves and 85 mini sleeves (plus some extras for lost or broken sleeves). Most sleeves will have a custom print, but some standard sized sleeves will be completely clear to accommodate the double-sided cards.\n\n\n\nPart of the fun of Kickstarter is achieving new heights and unlocking those sweet stretch goals. We've already packed a ton of content into the game, but we'll manage to find a way to get even more goodies in there. So let's break those seals!\n\nAt PAX Unplugged, we were able to run a number of tabletop media folks through the game. These opinions were freely given and provided without compensation. Here's what they had to say:\nWe know you'll love Return to Dark Tower. But you might be wondering why you should back now. There are four main reasons:\n You can get what you want. The game itself is not exclusive to Kickstarter. We do have a retailer pledge in the campaign, so there are stores who will have the game when it fulfills. However, we are still unsure if we will be able to sell the game into retail distribution, and the add-ons are particularly unlikely to be available widely if at all. Backing is the one way to make sure you get what you want.\n You'll get the game early. Even if the game does ultimately go into retail distribution, we promise to hold the retail street date for at least 90 days after fulfillment is completed. As a thank you for backing, we want to make sure our backers get the first chance to play.\n You'll get the game cheaper. As you can see above, you will pledge less than the suggested retail price. While it is true that some online retailers often sell games for below the regular price, that's less likely in this case. If the game ends up not going into retail distribution, aggressive discount merchants won't have access to it. Even if it does, the discount is likely not be much better than what we're offering in the campaign.\n You get to be a backer. Being a backer means being part of a community. You'll get to speak up on decisions we make during the campaign and share ideas with other backers. Most importantly, you'll help make this game become a reality. Some publishers have taken to using Kickstarter as a pre-order system. That is very much not the case with Return to Dark Tower. We simply could not make the game without the success of this campaign. You'll be a part of that success and part of unlocking stretch goals to make the game even better.\nIf this is your first Kickstarter, welcome! It's easier than it looks, and being a part of the community can be a lot of fun! You can download this PDF file to learn the ins-and-outs of being a backer:\n\nWe are once again using Quartermaster Logistics to oversee the fulfillment process. They have an extremely efficient system, quality packaging, tracking information, and their customer service is second to none. We have key fulfillment partners within each shipping region and will freight the games directly to them, so there will be no surprise charges, such as customs fees or VAT, to the US, EU, Canada, Australia, and China.\nPlease use the chart below to calculate your shipping fees. Due to an error in setting up the Kickstarter page, some countries are charged at the time of pledge, while others will be charged in the pledge manager after the campaign. You will also be charged additional shipping if you order add-ons or multiple copies and at similar rates.\n\n\nWe cannot ship to PO Boxes or to the following countries: Afghanistan, Burma (Myanmar), Cuba, Iran, Kazakhstan, North Korea, Russia, Sudan, Syria, and Ukraine.\nWe are also thrilled to be using BackerKit again. They are a \"pledge manager\", a third-party service that lets us manage our orders and fulfillment. This service starts after the Kickstarter campaign is over. You'll be able to add items to your pledge at that time. If you are unsure about what items you want to get during the Kickstarter campaign, you can back at the \"Map to BackerKit\" level. This will qualify you as a backer for any backer-related goodies and will give you access to the pledge manager to fill out your order later.\nRETAILERS\nWe have a special pledge tier for verified brick-and-mortar stores: For Bazaar Proprietors Only. You pledge only $50 during the campaign. In the pledge manager, you will finalize your order. However, you will not have to pay the remaining balance due until the games are ready to ship. Please click here for detailed information and terms.\n\nRestoration Games was founded in 2016 by Justin D. Jacobson and Rob Daviau on a shared love of all those great board games they played when they were kids. We are dedicated to restoring these games to their rightful glory,  bringing the fun we had to a new generation of gamers.\nSPREAD THE WORD\nA Kickstarter campaign is only as strong as its backers. You will help push this project to be the best it can be. We greatly appreciate anything you can do to let people know about this campaign, whether it's posting to your social media accounts, sending emails to your friends, or letting a co-worker know about us.\nIf you haven't joined the game's facebook group, go do it. We've got a great group of fans, talking about the game, and it's a good place to go to ask questions.\nAnother fun way to spread the word is adopting a social media avatar.

It's one last check to find any last little problem before we hit the big red button that says: spend a million dollars and make 25,000 copies of this game.\nI have to say, it's an extremely rewarding milestone. This is a project that I've been working on for three years. To open a box and see an actual playable game, is pretty amazing. But it's also a bit tense.

So, if inserts don't tickle your toes, you can jump straight to the end.\nBefore we get into it, the usual caveats: This is 99% final, but that means it's 1% not final, which basically means things can still change. Not likely but possible. This goes doubly for the box render and the stuff rendered in the insert, like the punchboard and rules and such. Without further ado, let's start at the top."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #47", "update_userinfo": "A Closer Look at the Competitive Game", "update_content": "For this update, I'll be showing off a bit more of the competitive game. As most of you know, the original game from 1982 was a competitive game. Players raced to defeat the brigands in the Tower. The first one to do it won the game. Early on in our development, we decided to make our restored version cooperative. We think it's more thematic appropriately and mechanically. But we knew some folks would like to be able to play competitively like in the original. We continued to work on it even as we entered the Kickstarter and finally announced we were doing it way back in Update #11."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #46", "update_userinfo": "Let's Check Out the Box Bottom", "update_content": "As we move into this next stage of production, my plan is to post smaller, more regular updates and start showing off some stuff you all haven't seen or that has been updated since the campaign. Today, we're going to take a quick look at the box bottom.\nFirst thing to mention is that it's not really the box bottom at all. The box will, of course, have a bottom, but this ain't it. Bigger picture, we know that you all have paid a lot of money to get this game. Granted, most of the expense is in that beautiful electronic Tower that will sit in the middle of the table. But we want to make sure the rest of the game meets that high bar. Traditionally, a box bottom serves as a marketing piece to attract the eye of someone browsing at the store, and it also has a number of legal requirements, like safety icons and copyright notices. Fine and necessary, but not pretty to look at. So we made the decision to have the traditional box bottom turn into a separate slip sheet that is placed over the box bottom and held into place by the shrinkwrap. When you open the shrink, you can toss the sheet. This meets our needs for the store shelf, but allows you to have a beautiful game box on your shelf at home."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #45", "update_userinfo": "Guest Update: Checking in on the Tower with Tim Burrell-Saward", "update_content": "I know folks like to get a closer look at the manufacturing process, and there's no one better to fill us in than Tim Burrell-Saward, our project manager and lead engineer.\nBefore we jump in, Board Game Geek's annual \"Most Anticipated\" list is underway.

This epic undertaking connected the United States from coast to coast for the first time. Now is your chance to make history!\nIn Pacific Rails Inc, players are the Presidents of their own Railway Company, with a contract to build a railroad from one side of the board to the other.\nWell-known for his work on the games Brass, Nocturion, and more, professional illustrator and game artist Damien Mammoliti joined the Vesuvius Media Team to create the stunning artwork of Pacific Rails Inc. From the box cover all the way to the game board, the artwork is highly-detailed and beautifully  crafted.\n Pacific Rails is language independent. The game's components have no text. As such, with just the rulebook you will be able to play the game in all supported languages.\nInside the game's box, the rulebook will be in English. However, through our website (http://www.vesuviusmedia.com) or the Hive Portal (http://www.hiveinteractive.net) you will be able to download the rulebook for the core game and its expansions in several supported languages (eg. English, Portuguese, French, German, Greek, Spanish, Italian, and more), after the end of the campaign.\nEnd Game Goals are random Victory Point milestones. Every time you play you choose a different combination of them, which will affect your overall strategy.\nAll the upgraded components in this image will be provided by \"Upgrade Your Games\", packaged separately from the core game.\nUsing our Stretch Goals we will try to upgrade the Resources of the Deluxe Edition, from simple plastic to components from the \"Upgrade Your Games\" collection. We have already unlocked the upgrade for wood, metal and gunpowder:\nUpgrade Your Games is a up-and-coming production company that creates high-quality tokens at competitive prices. From metal coins to pre-painted resin components (and more!), its goal is to enhance your gaming experience and help bring your favorite boardgames life! [http://www.upgrade-yourgames.com]\nThe Deluxe Components (and all related Stretch Goals) will be packaged separately. However, there will be room in the core box's plastic tray to fit them.\nLearn how to play by watching the following video:\nClick to download the BETA version of our rulebook.\nKickstarter Previews\nClick on this image for more information about our Retailer's Program\nClick on this image to get more information about our Group Orders.\nWe will charge shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. Payment will be collected via our pledge manager after the campaign. Shipping costs vary widely based on where you will receive your reward. Unfortunately, a one size fits all price isn't manageable.\nWe will pay to ship your rewards to our international distribution centers. Based on your delivery address, we will ship to you from one of the hubs below:\nUK: GamesQuest\nAsia: VFI\nAustralia: Aetherworks\nCanada: Snakes & Lattes\nUSA: QuarterMaster\nGermany, Rest of Europe & Rest of the World: Happyshops\nUK & Brexit:\nThe delivery time of the game is scheduled for September 2020. Right now, the UK is in an unstable and unknown status as far as its relationship with the EU is concerned. There is no way for us to predict how this is going to end and what repercussions this might inflict on shipping. Our goal is to bring the games into the EU and then find the best way to transfer them to the UK. We are monitoring the situation and will let you know more when we do.\nBrazilian Backers:\nWe are going to use VFI so we can give you a customs-friendly shipping solution. We understand that this might mean it will take longer to be fulfilled, but it ensures that there will be NO custom fees or surprise extra charges on your pledge!\nThe following is a list of rough estimates for shipping of the basic pledge. Please keep in mind that these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional add-ons you choose. All prices are listed in US dollars.\nHawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico and other remote states are not part of the USA category. They are included in the Rest of the World category.\nWe expect the shipping box for the Standard Edition tobe 29 cm x 29 cm x 12 cm and weigh around 2.5 kilograms. The estimated shipping rates, which are based on these assumptions, can be seen in the table below.\nPICKUP LOCATIONS\nIf you are close to any of the following locations, you can choose to pick up your reward and not pay shipping costs!\nConference Pickup\nIn our pledge manager you will be able to select as a pickup location one of the conferences that we will be attending. About 10 days before that conference you will receive an email with a special unique \"Pickup Code\" which you can bring to our booth to get your game, without paying any shipping costs! Below you can see a list of conferences that can be used as pickup location for this game:\nSpiel 2020 at Essen, Germany\nPax Unplugged 2020 at Philadelphia, United States\nAthensCon 2020 at Athens, Greece\nHalcon 2020 at Halifax, Canada\n[*] FanExpo 2020 at Toronto, Canada\n[*] GenCon 2020 at Indianapolis, United States\n[*] Conferences marked with the asterisk are still under consideration.

That is why we created a special Loyalty program.\nWhenever you select a pledge that has the Vesuvius Media Loyalty Credit item in it, you will receive a $5 Loyalty Credit for our next Kickstarter campaign. Loyalty Credit can be used to purchase add-ons.\nThis extra credit will be visible during the checkout process of the Hive Pledge Manager and you will be able to use it to buy add-ons (it can not be used for a main pledge nor for shipping costs).\nKeep in mind that the Loyalty Credit is per campaign and not per game. This means that if you backed us in only one campaign, even if you added all three games in a bundle, you will receive a $5 credit. We do this to be fair to backers who have paid more shipping costs by supporting us in multiple campaigns.\nIf you have Loyalty Credit from previous campaigns and choose not to use it in this one, then you will have an additional $5 for the next one.\nTo be eligible for the Loyalty Credit, you must pledge for a reward during this campaign. Late pledges and pledges of $1 will not qualify for any type of Loyalty Credit (credit from past campaigns or credit for future campaigns).\nVesuvius Media is a small (but mighty!), Canadian, indie development company. Starting off by producing online strategy games, Vesuvius Media has branched into new areas of production and currently boasts online games, mobile games, graphic novels and board games in its portfolio.\nWhat makes Vesuvius Media different from all the other companies? Vesuvius Media is community-driven. Whether online or on the table, its game designers and developers interact with players, listen, debate, and continually gather feedback. Its community of players help shape the future of its games!\nTo date, Vesuvius Media has successfully Kickstarted eleven (11) board game projects:\n Centauri Saga (Produced and Successfully Delivered) \n Cosmic Pioneers (Produced and Successfully Delivered) \n Dwar7s Fall (Produced and Successfully Delivered) \n Centauri Saga: Season 1 (Produced and Successfully Delivered) \n Covil: The Dark Overlords (Produced and Successfully Delivered) \n Dwar7s Winter (Produced and Successfully Delivered) \n Dwar7s Fall Collector's Edition (Produced and Successfully Delivered) \n Nocturion (Produced and Successfully Delivered) \n MonstroCity (Production Finished, estimated delivery February 2020)\n Up Your Game (Production under way, estimated delivery April 2020)\n Dwar7s Spring (Production under way, estimated delivery May 2020)\nYou can check out our Kickstarter Projects' history and stats on this cool website:\nhttps://www.tabletopanalytics.com/creator/vesuvius-media-ltd-78\nWe learn from our mistakes, we listen to your suggestions, and we strive to become better.

Supplier shortage, holiday traffic and weather conditions are just a few of the reasons a production could be delayed. Vesuvius Media Ltd should not be held responsible for delays caused by third parties. In addition, some of the items shown might differ from the final product due to supplier/manufacturer error.\n\nMISSING/DAMAGED ITEMS\n\nWhen dealing with a large number of orders, there is always a chance that errors will occur. If after you receive your order, you find that there are items missing, please contact us at support [at] vesuviusmedia.com and we will send you the missing items as soon as possible.\n\nIf your package arrives damaged, please take a few photos of all damaged items and email them to us at support [at] vesuviusmedia.com. We will send you replacements for the damaged items as soon as possible. \n\nDELIVERY DATE\n\nOur current estimation for delivery is September 2020. We want your orders to be delivered on time as much as you do; however, history has shown that despite the best laid plans there is always a chance of delay.\n\nUNDELIVERED ITEMS\n\nIf a package is not delivered due to a backer's fault (wrong address given, backer didn't claim the delivered package from their post office, etc), the backer may be requested to pay additional shipping fees for the item to be sent out again.\n\nBACKER RESPONSIBILITY\n\nIt is your responsibility to check the Kickstarter campaign's updates and the private messages we send you. If a backer does not complete the Pledge Manager in time, then the shipping rates to send you the game at a later time will be a lot higher (because they will not be part of the mass shipping process). If the game can not be delivered because you did not fill out your shipping information and more than 6 months have passed after the deadline, there is a chance we will not be able to deliver you the game. At that point, you will not be entitled to a refund. \n\nDELIVERY ADDRESS\n\nAfter this campaign, you will be requested to complete a survey through which you can let us know which items you have ordered as well as where you would like us to ship your order. Keep in mind that your order may be shipped sooner or later than the estimated delivery date. Please give us an address that will surely not change (If for example you think that you may be moving to a new house around May, please give us the address of a friend or relative to ensure a successful delivery).\n\nSHIPPING\n\nPlease read the Shipping section above.\n\nORDER FULFILLMENT\n\nPlease note that your order may be delivered in multiple packages. This is done due to weight limitations for group shipments. Even though the items you ordered will be shipped at the same time, there is always a chance they will arrive to you several days apart. This may occur due to each country's postal service sort-and-dispatch system.\n\nUPDATES\n\nThrough this campaign you may receive updates about Vesuvius Media's other upcoming projects. Such updates will be rare.\n\nYou will also receive notifications about future projects. These notification will also be very rare and it will be very easy for you to opt-out with on click.\n\nBY PLACING A PLEDGE ON THIS CAMPAIGN, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT THE RISKS & CHALLENGES STATED IN THIS SECTION.\n\nThank you very much,\n\nVesuvius Media Ltd.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "Standard Edition", "descp": "Get a copy of Pacific Rails Inc. and all applicable Stretch Goals.\n*Shipping charged after the campaign (see Shipping section for full details)\nINCLUDES:\nPacific Rails Inc.\nVesuvius Media Loyalty Credit\nApplicable Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["206 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "Deluxe Edition", "descp": "Get a copy of Pacific Rails Inc, a set of upgraded tokens, and all Stretch Goals.\n*Shipping charged after the campaign (see Shipping section for full details)\nINCLUDES:\nPacific Rails Inc.\nUpgraded Tokens\nVesuvius Media Loyalty Credit\nAll Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,341 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 120 or more", "title": "Retailer's Pledge", "descp": "A deposit of 4+ bundles of Pacific Rails Inc.

He first started playing video games when his parents got him his very own NES for Christmas, and the rest was history. Some of his best memories as a kid was playing Chrono Trigger and Earthbound. The thing Michael looks at the most in a game is a theme that\u2019s rich and well integrated into the mechanics. When he\u2019s not gaming, Michael enjoys spending time at his home in the mountains, as well as kayaking and hiking with his family.\nAlan is a software engineer during his day job, that translates into a fascination with game mechanics and the algorithms that power his favorite board games. He has been a life long video gamer and fell in love with the board game renaissance 10 years ago. He enjoys many different board game genres, and a good mechanic above all is his focus.\nBrett wasn't born loving board games like the rest of these nerds, but came to realize an affinity at a much older and saltier age. His appreciation for boardgames was born from a long history of video gaming.

Just wanted to give our backers in Europe the good news that all of the packages have been relabeled and are on their way! Collext was able to identify the problem with their courier integration and had to revert to some older methods to get all of the labels printed correctly. Based on their previous estimate, I'd expect 1-2 weeks for delivery to most folks.\nAs I've mentioned before, we can't thank you enough for all of your patience going through this. There's nothing more frustrating to a publisher than having games ready to get to backers & customers and once things are out of our hands things run into snags. While we hated to be the one that found the issue, I'm glad we helped identify the problem and things are moving again."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #12", "update_userinfo": "Europe Shipping Update!", "update_content": "Hey everyone! We finally have resolution on what the problem was with the non-UK game deliveries. Collext was able to track down that there was an error in the label printing / API integration to their shipping service. So the games are sitting at Heathrow airport and need to be reprocessed and relabeled. Collext is working with their courier to go through and get this taken care of so the games can go out as soon as possible. Luckily all of the packages are consolidated on a couple of pallets and aren't loose so that should help speed things up.

I'm guessing some will get out today & tomorrow and the rest early next week (lots of other fulfillments on their plates too).

There have been some issues with The Fair Youth expansion box & packaging that I wanted to address. \nDuring the planning process our top priority was to ensure the components for the expansion fit into the base game. As a byproduct of that, we decided to go with only a tuckbox in order to keep costs low for everyone. In general we hoped the tuckbox would a) provide some protection for the components in transit and b) provide retailers who backed something in packaging that could go on a shelf for customers. At one point we heavily debated just shrink-wrapping the components and packaging that way but figured the tuckbox would be a happy medium."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "Quick Shipping Update", "update_content": "Hi everyone!

We are raising funds to continue our coverage of board games and the people who play them.\nWe are a group of gamers dedicated to growing and promoting the board game hobby and those who enjoy it. Tom Vasel, Zee Garcia, Roy Cannaday, Mike Dilisio, and many others produce weekly videos covering hundreds of different games both new and classic. Additionally, Eric Summerer, Suzanne Sheldon, Mandi Hutchinson, and Tom produce a weekly podcast all about games and the people who play them.\nBut that's not all! We also provide you with news, variety shows (such as Board Game Breakfast), a series of popular \"Top Ten\" videos, shopping guides, and more! All of this can be found at our website - www.dicetower.com.\nOur show gets a majority of its funding from our Kickstarter campaign each year. We have six full-time employees and two part-time employees. Last year our focus was on producing more live content and increasing our convention coverage.  This year our goals are:\n Continue to produce regular live content on a set schedule \nIncrease interaction with our listeners\nContinue to increase the quality of our current YouTube shows\n Start a regular newsletter \nLots of top ten lists with special guests\n Upgrade our equipment \nWe're asking for your help as we pursue our goal of covering the entire world of board games. We have a myriad of cool rewards but we hope that your main goal in supporting this campaign is keeping the Dice Tower on the air. We are dedicated to keeping the show and our videos free for download and viewing, and appreciate those who join us in reaching that goal.  \n\nWe have a pile of wonderful rewards to send out to you as a gift for backing our campaign.  We know the value of these rewards does not come close to the amount you are donating to the show but they are simply a small \"thank you\" gift that we are sending as a token of our appreciation.\n The following promos each have their own pledge level, but also can be added to a regular pledge.  Simply add the amount to your pledge and you can choose which ones you want at the end of the campaign.

Play as one of five nations and race one a highly customizable track, providing a great experience over and over again\n  \"The chase is on, you have enough stamina to make a long sprint for the finish line, but will it be enough to grab the gold?\"\nWelcome to Ski Tour: Biathlon\nAs a skier representing your nation, do you have the stamina and marksmanship to make it onto the podium? Wax your skies, roll your dice, strategize, hit those targets at the shooting range and be the first to cross that finish line in this heart pumping game of skill, stamina and marksmanship! \nWhat makes Ski Tour: Biathlon a great game?\n Low downtime. The game plays in two phases where all players act simultaneously in phase one and then in turn order in phase two. However you will be able to react to other players actions during phase two, even when it's not your turn.\n High player interaction - Your every move is of uttermost importance for the other players. How do you position yourself? How can you prosper from other players actions?\n High replay value - Each nation has small variations to the others. How can you use your nation in the best way? Furthermore the modular board lets you build a new ski course each time you play. Build it as challenging as possible or easy and quick or make it resemble a course from the world cup!\n\n More reviews will be added during the campaign!\nPLAY\n\n Spielkult.de review of the game 8/10 (In german) \n BoardGameMonkeys article about the game (In german) \nDownload the rulebook using the link below:\nKlick to download rulebook\nIn Ski Tour: Biathlon you play as a biathlete representing your nation. The goal is to be the first one to cross the finish line. \nYour resources - Stamina and Strength\nYour main resource is stamina which is represented by wooden hearts. Stamina can be spent to either increase your speed or to make bold moves to pass opponents. In other words, stamina is what drives your skier forward at a higher pace. At the same time stamina is also the resource that determines the chance your biathlete has to hit the targets at the shooting range. Higher stamina equals a higher chance to hit the five targets. Misses at the range means laps in the penalty lane. A really low stamina also affects your chances of making sprints or building up really high speeds. \nEach round, players will simultaneously roll dice to determine their available strength in the preparation phase. Then in turn order they will perform actions to move their biathlete forward along the track in the race phase. \nWhen all have performed their actions the first player marker is moved one step and again players determine available strength. The game is played in two phases.\nOutsmart your opponents\nDuring the race you must position yourself carefully to take advantage of other players while not providing advantages to anyone else. Players may draft behind opponents to get extra steps or sprint to prevent drafting. You can also position yourself well in downhills so that your opponents cannot take advantage and draft behind your slipstream. You must also save up energy to be able to push the uphills so you dont get lactic acid and take to many turns to get up. Also plan your race so that you have good chances to hit the targets at the shooting range and maybe even in one single turn. \nHow will you plan your race? \nSetup for success\nEach player controls their nations basecamp. This is their player board. During setup, each player place five stamina markers on their player board - wooden hearts of the same color as the nation. \nThey also wax their skies on the bottom of the player board with each nations set of unique wax tokens, a total of 30 tokens.\nEach player will also recieve ten dice colored in their nations color as well as a skeeple (wooden skiing meeple) and five hit or miss markers. \nThe game has 20 terrain tiles that are used to build the course. There are start and finish tiles, uphills, downhills, shooting ranges, straights and two types of turns. \nAlso there is a first player marker and 4 shooting dice in 4 different colors matching the levels of stamina on each players player board. \nDisclaimer: These images are 3d rendered and appearance may be a little different from production..\n\n\n\n\n\">\n\nShipping will be charged after the campaign via a pledge manager.

Protecting your great gamer treasures has never been so easy! With a project guided by you - the Backers! - through regular new product votes, we can make sure that you will receive the protection you need. We are proud to present Paladin Card Protection Season 4!\nPaladin comes in 30 sizes of clear sleeves, with 3 of the most popular sizes as double matte, anti-glare transparent protectors, and topped by 8 types of colored-back double matte CCG-size sleeves!\nDesigned to fit your gaming needs, and with free shipping to all supported locations, Paladin Card Protectors make a glorious return to shield your cards from wear and tear!\nImportant: All our sleeves are available by default as clear gloss. All our solid back sleeves are matte.\nA new technology unlocked by our factory allowed us to create a sleeve of unparalleled thickness and the superior strength of binding. A smaller clearance of 0.5 mm seals the card inside perfectly. The Titan is the toughest and thickest card protector out there - for the true collectors in need of absolute card protection.\nWe have been gathering suggestions of sleeve sizes from our backers to create a list of new sleeves you may need. Four of those suggestions become the contents of the first poll (voted on via comments in an update) . After we close the poll, the highest voted type becomes the newest Stretch Goal on its way to join the ranks of Paladin Protectors forever.\nWhile the sleeve size with most votes automatically becomes the next stretch goal, the runner-up together with the third place get thrown back in the shuffle and may reappear at a later time, while the fourth place will be discarded.\nPaladin Card Protection is made by people who have been active in the hobby industry for a combined duration of over half a century. We play games and we make games! That gives us a unique perspective, allowing us to set a new industry standard for sleeve packs!\nCards for most modern board games are printed on sheets of 110 cards each (which can be easily divided into two 55-card decks). This is why so many designer board games come with a number of cards that is a multiple of 55 \u2013 and this is also the reason why Paladin Card Protectors also come in packs of 55.\nWe know how precious your games are to you - after all, we are gamers just like you! There are many great reasons you should choose Paladin Card Protection - here are just three of the most important ones:\n1. Our protectors are extremely durable. With a thickness of 90 microns, our sleeves will prevail in the harshest gaming conditions, while still keeping the combined height of sleeved decks reasonable.\n2. Paladin Card Protectors are clear, safe to use (no acid, no PVC), and they come in packs of 55, because we know you will need more than 50 with each packet. Why? Because most standard card decks in the industry are made of 55 or 110 cards.\n3. We are gamers, and we listen to gamers! For Season 4 that means YOU get to vote on each stretch goal, effectively choosing every new sleeve size that joins the proud Paladin ranks!\nChoosing Paladin as your personal card protector also means, that you will pay no shipping fee. Let us say this again: shipping is free, wherever you order from!\n\nPaladin Card Protectors will be manufactured in China by the same company which has been producing for us gaming sleeves during the past two years. They are one of the leading companies making card sleeves, and they have proven capable of manufacturing the highest quality product, as evidenced by our happy fans and backers around the globe.\nMore than ever, we want to ensure that Paladin Card Protectors meet the highest quality standards. Thus, production will take place under our direct supervision, and we will have a person present at the factory as Paladin sleeves are coming out of the assembly line. We will check for clarity, binding, durability and size consistency.\nAs a new thing for Season 4, we will add another layer of quality control: we will ask the factory to assign a person to supervise the production process and the assembly process, and to check at random a significant number of sleeve packs for any damage. This way we hope to raise our standard even higher.\nWe have learned from the delays of first season, understanding that sleeve manufacturing will take longer due to the increased quality control measures. Also, we need to allow more time for packing, as manually selecting hundreds of thousands of sleeve packs is an error-prone process which is also very time consuming.\nPaladin Card Protection was created by a team of passionate gamers and game design and publishing specialists, working (and playing games together!) for NSKN Games (now merged and working under the name of Board and Dice). As gamers, we wanted to create the perfect type of sleeve: offering high level of protection, while having an as small as possible influence on your gaming experience.\nMost Paladin Card Protectors are 90 microns thick. This means, that they are thicker than most of the popular brands of Premium sleeves. We offer extremely high durability, and a level of protection that keeps your cards away from harm in any gaming situation.\nWe chose the thickness of 90 microns to maximize binding, making Paladin Card protectors almost unbreakable, while your cards stay well protected, for an affordable price.\nHowever, for the first time in Paladin's history, we are offering a 120-micron sleeve. What has changed? The factory we are working with has developed new technology that allows them to strentghen the binding on sleeves thicker than 100 microns, allowing us to test the new type of super-durable sleeve. While this level of protection may not be needed by most board gamers, it is a superior way to protect collectible items, as well as cards included in out-of-production or rare games.\nFinally, we wanted sleeves that are clear and safe to use. No PVC or acid is an industry standard which we adhere to. We have personally made sure that the materials used guarantee the highest level of clarity, so that you can enjoy the cards you choose to protect the way they you want to enjoy them: in full, vivid and unmodified colour and sharpness.\nPlease read carefully before pledging for this project!\nThe Pledge Manager\nWe will be using a pledge manager after the campaign.

To achieve this, most manufacturers advise against elevated temperatures and high states of charge for prolonged periods of time, yet many of us leave our devices on charge all night. Charging all night causes the batteries in our devices to spend a significant proportion of their lifetime at full capacity and raised temperatures, highly detrimental to their health.\nCharging all night means we wake up to a fully charged device, but in a world where our environmental impact is an ever-growing concern, maximising the lifetime of our device is imperative. As manufacturers move to designs where battery replacement becomes harder, batteries become the first point of failure for many devices. ProCharge delays your device's charge, to maximise its battery's lifetime.\nSolution\nProCharge is compatible with any device that charges using USB (Type A). It sits between your current USB outlet and charging cable to control your device's charge cycle.\nWith ProCharge's default settings, your device will start charging after 6 hours, and stop charging after 2 hours. This significantly reduces the time your device's battery spends fully charged, and at raised temperatures. ProCharge also prevents your device from fast-charging, a technology that should only be used when necessary, due to the increased stress it puts on the battery. With ProCharge's built-in mode button and status LED, you can adjust the delay and charge time to suit your needs.\nProCharge\nFeatures\nProCharge's compact form-factor includes a reversible Type-A USB plug, standard Type-A USB socket, status LED and mode button.\nThe reversible USB input optimises compatibility with USB outlets.\nReversible USB Plug\nThe top and side visibility ensures that the status LED is always visible. Its minimal brightness prevents ProCharge keeping you awake at night.\nTop and Side LED Visibility\nThe raised profile and tactile feel of the mode button allows for easy use, even in the dark.\nRaised Profile and Tactile Feel Mode Button\nThe mode button and status LEDs are used to programme and start the timer. Delay and charge timers can be set, started and skipped.\nThe  disconnected USB data lines enable secure charging from any public USB port, protecting your personal data. Additionally, this disables fast-charging modes.\nThe low power standby mode consumes the same power in a year, that a 50W light bulb consumes in under 20 seconds!\nSpecifications\n Current rating:          2A\n Voltage rating:          5.5V\n Dimensions:              39x16x10mm\n Case material:          3D printed white PA2200 Nylon\n Timing accuracy:     \u00b11s per hour\n Standby power:        30uW (0.00003W)\n Insertion lifetime:    >10,000 insertons\n Button lifetime:        >30,000 presses\nProCharge Internal Hardware\nOperation\nFor safety reasons, ProCharge MUST be used in conjunction with USB outlets and charging cables from reputable suppliers.\nPLAY\n\nStatus LEDs:\n Off - Standby: device will never charge.\n Amber - Delay: device will charge after set delay.\n Red - Charge: device will charge for set time.\nModes: Cycle modes in the above order by pressing button. Delay/charge time flashed in hours between standby/delay.\nSetting Delay: Press button until status LED is off, then hold button for number of yellow flashes (hours) required.\nSetting Charge: Press button until status LED is fading amber, then hold button for number of red flashes (hours) required.\nDefault: Delay 6 hours and charge 2 hours.

Take care though; in a land where the day blends into night it\u2019s easy to lose track of time and you still need to find that special little island to call home. \nTranquility is a co-operative strategy game for 1-5 players suitable for players aged 8-100 and games last around 15-20 minutes. Players must fill the sea with islands and guide the ship home before any player runs out of cards. In the world of Tranquility though, the only way to play is in silence. \nTranquility is the first game by talented designer James Emmerson and features stunning artwork by Tristam Rossin.\nPledges cost \u00a312 (plus shipping charged afterwards in our pledge manager; see shipping estimates below)\nPlease read the following overview to get a flavour of the game or refer to the current full rules here. Alternatively please take a look at one or more of the excellent preview videos below.\nThe goal of the game is for the team to complete the grid before any player runs out of available actions. Cards must be placed so that the grid ascends in numerical order from bottom left to top right. All the players win if they manage to complete the grid and have placed a Start and Finish card. All players lose if a single player can no longer play or discard any cards legally following the instructions given below. The players may not, however, communicate.  \nDemo game in progress at The Great Indoors 2019\n Play is taken in turns moving clockwise with the quietest player going first. On a player\u2019s turn they must do one of the following: 1. Play a card or 2. Discard two cards. Then they must draw back up to a hand of five cards. \nPlaying a card\nThe active player must select an Island card from their hand and may place it anywhere in the grid providing it adheres to the following rules:\n1. Cards must be placed so that the grid ascends in numerical order from bottom left to top right.\n2. If the card is placed next to an existing card then they must discard cards from their hand equal to the difference between the numbers face down in front of them e.g. placing a 5 next to a 3 will require two cards to be discarded from their hand.  \nCard no.63\nDiscarding two cards\nA player may be forced (or may choose) to discard cards rather than playing a card. In this case they must discard two cards face down in front of them e.g. towards the end of the game, when the grid is nearly full, it is possible that players will be legally unable to play any of the cards in their hand. This would force them to discard two cards instead.\nStart and Finish cards\nA player must use their turn to play a Start card if they have one in their hand at the start of their turn and one has not yet been played. As a group, the players must discard a total of eight cards between them. They may discuss how many cards each player is willing to discard but not specifics about what is in their hand or where they might wish to play.\nA player may only play a Finish card once the rest of the grid (plus Start card) has been completed. Finish cards may be discarded using the normal rules but beware: there are only five!  \nIsland, Start and Finish card artwork\n The players win if a player successfully plays a Finish card after the grid is complete before any single player is unable to play. The players lose if any player cannot make a legal move because either: 1. they have only one card left in their hand at the start of their turn which cannot be played to the grid or 2. they have no cards left in their hand at the start of their turn. \n Included with the standard game are three mini-expansions that significantly change the level of difficulty as well as introducing a nice variety of rule changes that make the game even more replayable.\n1. Jagged Rocks: The game begins with the Jagged Rocks card placed randomly on one of the six border cards on the left-hand side of the grid; this row is considered as temporarily impenetrable so no cards may be placed into it.  \nJagged Rocks\n 2. Sea Monsters: The game begins with three, four or five Sea Monster cards shuffled into the deck before it is dealt out to players (depending on the level of difficulty the players wish to add). On their turn the player may play their Sea Monster card into the grid by placing it on top of any previously played card. The Sea Monster destroys the card and then both cards are removed from the game.   \nSea Monster\n 3. Storm & Compass: The game begins with six Storm cards shuffled into the deck. The six Compass cards are placed to the side of the playing area. A player resolves a Storm card as soon as it is drawn. \nYellow Storm: The player places the Yellow Storm card face up in front of them and immediately discards down to three cards which is their new hand limit until the Storm card is removed.\nPurple Storm: The player places the Purple Storm on one of the six border cards on the left-hand side of the grid on a row with at least one empty space. This marks the entire row as temporarily impenetrable so no cards may be placed into it. \nOrange Storm: The player places the Orange Storm card face up in front of them. For all future turns the player may now only 1. Play next to an existing card, discarding the appropriate number of cards as per the usual rules or 2. Discard two cards. \nOrange Storm\n Compass: Compass cards may be played to help the players navigate the Storms and remove playing restrictions. Compass cards may be acquired in three different ways: 1. When the start card is played, the players earn one Compass card to use. 2. By filling an entire row with consecutive cards (e.g. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17) and 3. If a player chooses to discard their whole hand. \nCompass\n Every copy of Tranquility includes:\n80 Island Cards, 5 Start cards, 5 Finish cards, 3+ Reference cards, 25 Border cards, 18 Stormy Seas expansion cards and rule sheet.\n The cards are 400 gsm matte laminate. They feel fantastic and don't need to be sleeved.  \n\n\n\nHairy Game Lords\nRahdo runs through\n Game Boy Geek\nOne Stop Co-op Shop\n slickerdrips\n Board, Deck & Dice\nhttps://www.boardseyeview.net/post/2019/10/15/tranquility\nhttps://thegameshelf.blogspot.com/2019/10/the-game-shelf-previews-tranquility.html\n https://www.kickstartgaming.com/games/tranquility/\nBecause of the uncertainty of shipping costs pre-campaign, we have decided to use a Pledge Manager so we can make sure that neither Board Game Hub nor backers are out of pocket. We do not intend to use fulfillment companies unless the campaign significantly over-funds so any potential import/customs fees will be paid by backers. The game is being manufactured in the UK by Dice Sports Ltd and will likely be shipped by Royal Mail for backers within the UK, EU and the Rest of the World. Depending on the number of pledgers from the EU and rest of the world regions, we estimate the following shipping costs for a single copy:\n UK: \u00a33\n EU: \u00a35 - \u00a38\n Rest of the world - \u00a37 - \u00a312\nNB: The exact location of backers does not seem to affect the prices we've been provided with for shipping. The estimates are all based on how many International backers we have in total, not your location.\nThe cost of shipping will be higher for triple pledges, particularly for EU and RoW (though UK postage cost may remain the same). but we estimate only between \u00a31 and \u00a34. Just to reiterate, this is only an estimate as are the above costs.\nTBC: We hope to offer free collection at AireCon, 13th - 15th March 2020, at Harrogate Convention Centre, UK. This will be confirmed in time for the pledge manager and be available in lieu of shipping for all backers who wish to make use of this option. \nWe welcome the chance to work with bricks-and-mortar game stores in the UK and elsewhere to get Tranquility out into the world. We will not be offering retail pledges as part of the Kickstarter campaign but we intend to offer competitive rates post-campaign once the level of funding is realised. If you run a bricks-and-mortar store and wish to register your interest or ask for more information then please email us.\n After the campaign is complete, we will run a Pledge Manager to confirm shipping costs and offer add-ons such as deluxe playmats manufactured by Patriot Games in Sheffield, UK. These playmats are printed on 2mm neoprene and are 72cm x 72cm in size with rounded edges. Backers will also be able to add more copies to their order. Please bear in mind that postage costs will increase when purchasing add-ons.\nPrototype playmat\nIf you've reached this far, thank you for your interest and support of this campaign.

I can only try to reassure anyone with concerns that although we haven't run a Kickstarter campaign before, we have been advised by a number of publishers with much greater experience than us and so (hopefully) will not suffer any of the pitfalls that first-time publishers sometimes experience.\n\nThe budget is solid and if we reach our funding level we guarantee that we won't be cancelling the campaign. Some companies seem to set artificially low targets so as to achieve 100% funding early, which is attractive to backers.

The SwitchBot Curtain is not affected by such bumps.\nInstall in seconds\n U Rails, retrofitted\nThe SwitchBot Curtain has hooks for U-rail. It is simple to attach the respective hooks to the rails.  \nInstall in seconds\n I Rails, retrofitted\nThe SwitchBot Curtain has hooks for I-rail. It is simple to attach the respective hooks to the rails. \nInstall in seconds\nOpen and close the curtain at your fingertip. We offer intuitive App control for iOS and Android, with weekly/bi-weekly updates following feedback from you. OTA firmware update is also available for better user experience.\nIntuitive UI\nSmart living is powered by your voice commands. Wouldn't it be great to just say it?\n\"Alexa/Ok Google/Hey Siri, close my curtain please\" (Hub is required)\nEven with SwitchBot Curtain, you'd probably still instinctively draw the curtains by hand some times. When it senses you drawing the curtain, the SwitchBot Curtain will kick in and do the work for you. We call this Touch & Go.\nSwitchBot Curtain makes even the conventional way to draw a curtain smarter.\n\nA wireless remote button add-on for you to place anywhere. \nHold it or mount it. Your say.\nDouble-sided curtains are very common and we have been getting a lot of enquiries about how to use the SwitchBot Curtain with these. You could get two units and part the double-sided curtains from the middle. Or, you could try out this tip from the King of Retrofit! Attach the top curtains with a velcro strip or a strong clip so the curtains will move as one. Then install the SwitchBot Curtain on either ends to let it work its magic!\nSo your next question is probably where to find a velcro strip. Good news is, we believe so strongly in retrofitting that we will ship every SwitchBot Curtain with a velcro strip in the box as a standard accessory.\nThe SwitchBot Curtain is so small that it hides nicely behind your curtains. It will work in its own way without getting in your way.  Likewise, we keep the sophisticated mechanism within the body of the SwitchBot Curtain, giving you fast and easy installation so you can enjoy the benefits it brings.   \nSize fits in your palm.\nInstead of a wired system, the SwitchBot Curtain is a wireless solution. It uses a rechargeable battery that lasts 8 months depending on the usage. This means you only need to charge it once or twice a year! \nWhat's more, you can forget about having to charge it by getting the solar power strip add-on. Sunlight will ensure the SwitchBot Curtain is charged up for its daily work routine.\nOur SwitchBot Curtain is very complicated from the inside so it is so SIMPLE for you on the outside.\nOur SwitchBot Curtain is very complicated from the inside so it is so SIMPLE for you on the outside.\nIn the box, 2 types of hooks will be there for your preference.\nSwitchBot Hub Mini\nHub for SwitchBot Curtain and a universal Infrared remote control (Recommended)\nWhy we need your support\nWe have finished the development of the SwitchBot Curtain and we are excited to get it into the market to you. However, we cannot bring this product to life without your support. We need to raise funds for the raw materials and components needed to start mass production of the SwitchBot Curtain.\nFind us on GitHub: https://github.com/OpenWonderLabs/\nA few years ago, we shared the possibility to control SwitchBot on their Raspberry Pi, OpenWRT board, or PC running Linux based system. It has been a fantastic journey since then with contributions by many users who love to DIY! \nMakers who don't want to use Bluetooth controls can now choose to use our RESTFUL APIs. Moreover, you can use Home Assistant!\nTap on the power of IFTTT + Webhook to create and trigger countless incredibly creative scenarios! \nBoost your creativity! \nDoes the SwitchBot Curtain inspire you to use it in other ways? Yes, we thought it would. That's why we are sharing the STL files to build your hooks after the campaign!\nBesides adapting the SwitchBot Curtain to work with any rods and rails, you can also use create hooks to extend the SwitchBot Curtain's function! We came up with wacky ideas such as using it to open and close the door,  and building a cam cable to mounting a small action camera or the OSMO Pocket. We are excited to see what creative ideas can you come up with!\nBe creative with your cat.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nIt took us 2 years to have everything ready. We don't want a bad product for you.\nDevelopment and testing \nThe SwitchBot Curtain is not possible before we develop, craft, and test tirelessly in the past 2 years. We tried and tested thousands of rods and rails, and found every possible way to stress test it. \nWe listen. We fix. We iterate.\nValidated thousands of rods and rails\nThe roller coaster test\nSwitchBot Curtain is strong!\n2017 to now\nChoose one of the add-ons for each add-on pledge\nPress kit is available here. \nThe words\nThank you SwitchBot community!\nSwitchBot has grown since our last successful campaign.

One night after reading before sleeping, he realized that he cannot even turn off his bedroom light and close his curtain on the bed. This led to the team evaluating all kinds of self-proclaimed smart switches and curtains in the market. Our first thought was to have a robot butler. Yet, the reality is that despite years of robots making the news, we have not seen a real robot that in our homes. Thus, we began our adventure to create a useful, simple and convenient bot. SwitchBot is the fruit of our labor.

All artwork may be subject to final changes.\nIn Magnate: The First City, you are a property developer trying to make as much money as you can in a city wide construction boom.\nMagnate: Real final prototype imagery. All artwork may be subject to final changes.\nYou'll have to choose the land you're going to buy and decide what to build there from a range of realistic 3D buildings. You'll collect rent from the tenants you attract to your developments and then, when the time is right, sell your property for a massive profit.\nMagnate: Real final prototype imagery. All artwork may be subject to final changes.\nBut beware, your actions will cause prices to rise. Eventually prices will climb too high and the boom will turn to bust in a game-ending market crash! Don't get caught out when it does.\nAll pledges contain the Magnate core game, which has the following components:\nThe game will come with an English rulebook. But the rulebook and the game's player aids will also be translated into German, Spanish and French and made freely available as a PDF before the campaign is fulfilled. As the vast majority of the game's components are language independent, we believe this will be sufficient for German Spanish and French speakers to learn and enjoy the game. \nWe're very open to having it translated into other languages - if there is enough demand - so feel free to message us or leave a comment!\nIf you want to read the current draft rulebook, you can find it here. \nPLEASE NOTE:\nThis is a draft and hasn't yet been laid out in its final form\nWe expect the production rulebook to be quite a bit shorter and much more attractively laid out\nWhile the rules are now stable, there are still improvements in wording and explanation for us to make\nThere's even more content in the Tycoon pledge!\nThe tycoon pledge contains three mini-expansion modules for Magnate that further enhance gameplay and provide entirely new options. If we hit our stretch goals, there will be unique component upgrades not available in the basic pledge.\nAll of these expansions came out of the same rigorous testing process of the core game, but couldn\u2019t be practically incorporated into core product. We love playing with these expansions at Magnate HQ so rather than let them sit on a shelf, we wanted you to enjoy them too!\nAt present, we have no plans to bring these specific expansions to retail, so this Kickstarter may be your only chance to get them!\n\n\n*Final name subject to approval.\n*Final artwork subject to approval.\n\n\nWe'd love to make Magnate an even better product - and thanks to backers we already have! But with your help, we can make even further upgrade the game's components:\n\n\nLots of reviewers have already played Magnate. So don't take our word for it when we say we love it! See what they have to say:\n\nKey features\nSome of the things we're most excited about:\nREALISTIC 3D MINATURES: Magnate comes with a beautiful set of 50+ lovingly sculpted, plastic building miniatures: all of which are inspired by real world buildings. By having these true-to-life buildings rather than just tokens or chits, the city really comes to life!\nSTRATEGIC GAMEPLAY WITH A SATISFYING GAME ARC: Magnate is a tight game with a very strong power curve. Every decision you make really matters and will subtly force your opponents to rethink their plans. You will start small - often with a single house - but you will end with a huge pile of cash and some very tough calls to make. \nDYNAMIC PROPERTY MARKET: The game's property market is genuinely responsive to what players do, just like a real market. If players sell too much, they'll make a huge market crash more likely. If they stop hyping-up the city with advertising, they'll cause the boom to slow down. If they overbuild and suck out all the tenants... you can guess! When these start colliding with the players aims, the end-game decisions get very tough indeed.\nADVANCED RULES: The core game includes a set of advanced tenants which you can pick from when attracting tenants (if you meet their requirements), hugely increasing your choices and allowing you to make entirely new combo moves with your property. \nAll three mini expansions also greatly increase your options: the slow-burn but super powerful residential tower gives you a new way to use home tenants. The vast array of asymmetric powers you can gain from employees creates entirely new play styles and the blind bidding system makes bids more hair-raising and tense than ever. \nAI MODE: Magnate includes a \u2018Cardboard AI\u2019 that can be used at any player count in place of a human opponent - not just for solo play. The game's structure stays the same - the AI just operates within it (with a bit of cheating!). The AI has been designed to behave like a human player, so that even after you\u2019ve played it against it many times, it remains unpredictable without feeling entirely random.\nTUTORIAL MODE: We know that learning from a rulebook can be the toughest way to learn a game . While we've put huge effort into making the rulebook as good as it can be, we think nothing can beat a teach! That's why the game includes a guided tutorial deck which will teach the players all the core aspects of the game in bite sized chunks over two scripted turns. \nWhy are we launching on Kickstarter?\nFinal prototype art pictured. All artwork may be subject to final changes.\nIt's been ambition to turn Magnate into a game you could one day buy at a store for a long time - ever since the very first version was created. After two years of hard work, playtesting and developing the game and its components, we are finally ready to bring it to market. \nBut we can't do that without the substantial investment required to manufacture the very first print-run of the game. With its strong track record for making tabletop projects a reality, Kickstarter was the best place for us to raise those funds. \nAbout the team \nDesigner & Publisher: James Naylor\nMagnate was designed by James Naylor and will be published by his company, Naylor Games. James is London based board game designer and publisher who is passionate about product design and its role in game experience. His professional background is in product management where he has had multiple roles, including head of product and engineering for a multinational advertising technology company and independent product consultant on numerous startups. He is a passionate board game enthusiast who likes tension, drama and the potential for emergent strategy in his games.\nLead Developer: Jaya Baldwin \nMagnate's core gameplay and AI mode was refined, tested and developed by Jaya Baldwin, who also works with James on the many other tasks involved in publishing games.  Jaya is a game developer/designer and professional actor in immersive theatre. The shows Jaya has performed in and helped design have received multiple 5 star reviews from national newspapers and well reputed theatre publications. Jaya loves challenging games that take players on adventures and provide memorable experiences.\nJames and Jaya are supported by a huge network of professionals, friends and family who are helping bring this project to fruition.\nShipping\nAll shipping will be managed in the pledge manager after the campaign is completed. Please do not add shipping to your pledged amount during the campaign. \nThe following are estimates for the costs to ship to different parts of the world:\nUK/EU: US$10-15 (\u00a38-12 / \u20ac 9-14)\nUS/CA: US$15-20 (CA$20-27)\nAU/NZ: US$15-20 (AU:$25-$30)\nCH/HK/MO: US$10-15\nJP/PH/KR/SG/TH/VN/TW: US$15-25\nROW: US$15-35\nPlease note that for some countries in the 'Rest of World' category, there may be shipping surcharges due to location or additional items or upgrades. Prices will vary depending on location and changes in shipping cost at time of locking the pledge manager.\nWe are still evaluating the best fulfilment providers for this project but have several assessed quotes already. We expect to deliver before the end of 2020 so there should be no additional customs surcharges as a result of the UK's planned departure from the customs union at the end of the Brexit implementation period. \nRetailers welcome!\nIf we are successful enough, our goal is to eventually turn Magnate into a retail game product: This will only happen if we have substantial backer support now. But its familiar themes, high production values, moderate weight and intuitive gameplay make us believe it could be a good retail product. So if you\u2019re a retailer we want to hear from you. \nWe don\u2019t have a retailer pledge level on this campaign but if you're interested in stocking Magnate,  drop us a quick note on this form and we\u2019ll be in touch to work out an approach that works for you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAlthough this our first Kickstarter we've put considerable effort to mitigate the risks inherent to any Kickstarter project:\n\n*General precautions*\n\nBecause this is our first project, we have taken extra time to ensure every detail of the project is correct. The core game was an enjoyable, fun design almost two years ago. The remaining effort since then has been mainly focused on making it a good game *product* (art, testing, production). \n\nWe have sought extensive guidance of numerous tabletop industry veterans during this time, and are ably supported by a strong industry network of experienced rulebook editors, manufacturers, other game designers and marketers with experience running complex Kickstarter projects.\n\n*Game design & development*\n\nThe core's game design is 100% finished, and, according to reviews by well regarded critics is already a fun and engaging title. We've been demoing the game in a form very close to its final development for more than a year at multiple tradeshows and have only been making refinements and minor improvements in that time. This means we have strong validation that the game will be widely enjoyed. Only the expansion content and AI mode require further blind testing to make their rulebooks (not gameplay) the best they can be. We are confident we can execute this before they need to be manufactured given the timescales we have recommended. \n\n*Art and graphics*\n\nThe art and graphical elements of the game (including expansion content) are 90+% complete. We still have some refinement to do, but do not expect the visuals to change much - so there are few risks here.\n\n*Manufacturing, shipping & financials*\n\nWe have put extensive effort into assessing the viability of the product. We have spent considerable time making careful component quality and material choices to make sure this is a product that can be produced for a good price that represents value for backers. We have secured detailed quotes from multiple manufacturers and completed due diligence on them to ensure estimates are not only competitive but realistic.

This includes creating the RetroX emulation frontend for Android, which has 50.000+ registered users, 27 systems supported, and five years of development with Java/ C/C++ code.\nThis Kickstarter project requires the team\u2019s technical knowhow to bring SWOS to the modern day. For Android, it will be necessary to add in a keyboard for the game and overlay it. Bluetooth controller capability will be added in, and further down the line work will begin on creating a Multiplayer mode for SWOS.\nThere is a great deal of coding, re-coding and debugging required, in order for the game to be ported to other devices from its DOS version. Decompiling the game means that the team have to work with code and re-write everything to other languages.\nYour Kickstarter investment will start the journey, bringing SWOS to Android initially, and on hitting our stretch goals, will be ported to other platforms** such as Steam, PS4, iOS and Switch.\nJoin us on a step back in time, kicking a ball around the pitch \u2013 help bring this dream into the future.

You will need to gather allied advisors, manage your workers, recruit armies and, together with other players, raise and defend the Great Wall! As the game progresses, you will often need to negotiate and interact with other players, but make no mistake \u2013 there can be only one winner\n \u201cIts an interesting game (\u2026) I have to play some more, its pretty high for me! Theme is really strong.\u201d-  Tom, Dice Tower\n\u201eDefinitely quality! (\u2026) Theme is super cool and the tension! The tension in this game is real. Very interesting game! \u201c   - Rob, Rob\u2019s Gaming Table \n\u201cAll of this comes together in a very unique way, in which players will continue to work together and against one another to earn they Honor points\u201d- Jeremy, Man vs Meeple \n\u201cThe Great Wall has enough depth to continually enjoy each new play session as you customize your experience and have new interactions with other players.\u201d - Michael, King of Average \n  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkDst2rvGG4&t=  \n\n\nThis fresh worker (and soldier!) placement game for 1-4 players faces them with many difficult choices and often pushes them to interact with each other. You will be assigning your workers to eleven different locations, such as Tea House, Quarry, Messenger Post, or Barracks, using special Command cards that have additional effects. Production in locations activates ONLY when all their slots are filled with clerks, but filling them all by yourself can result in a penalty. On top of that, players can buy overseers who will give additional output every time a location becomes activated. This creates a lot of involving long- and short-term strategies.\n Each player starts with one unique General, characterized by their asymmetric power, as well as the production level. From there, you will further customize your economic engine and fine-tune your strategy by recruiting advisors who provide additional bonuses.\nEventually, a Wall Defence phase beings, where players place previously build armies on Horde Cards \u2013 earning Honor (Victory points) and looting resources from the defeated troops. This requires smart management of three types of units: Archers, Spearmen and Cavalry.

Players will have to roll with the whims of fate as they face a never before seen challenge in the Medici line, of games: dice!\nMedici: The Dice Game is the third game in the Medici family of games, all designed by the world\u2019s best known tabletop designer, Dr Reiner Knizia, and illustrated by the stunning Vincent Dutrait!\nGrail Games has successfully Kickstarted Medici the board game twice (you can see these campaigns here and here), as well as Medici: The Card Game (see here). Both titles are well-respected and regarded.\nThe new Dice Game is a stand-alone sister game to the previous titles. It uses similar ideas, but is powered by dice-rolling and selecting mechanisms.\nOn a turn, players will select dice that depict various goods of different values to fill their ship, before going to market and scoring for both the value of their ship, and for collecting the different types of goods over three rounds (days).\nMedici: The Dice Game is for 2-4 players aged 10 and up and takes about 30 minutes to play.\nTo watch David from Grail Games teach and play the game, please click on the link below.\nAnd if you would like to read the rule book, please click the button below!\nWith your support, each copy of Medici: The Dice Game will include...\n...and more will be added to the game should we meet the stretch goals listed below!\nWith your support we will not only fund the production of this great little game, but also, have the opportunity to make the game even better! Should we over-fund, we will use the extra to add the following to Medici: The Dice Game...\nWoo hoo! Thank you!\n16mm dice are nice, but 20mm are even better!\nWe will add artwork to the inside bottom of the box so you can roll your dice each round within the confines of your square ship hold!\nAfter we reach this funding goal, we can afford to add a purple, velvet-like drawstring bag to the game to hold you 20mm dice! \n...and hopefully we can make the dice bag even fancier, by embroidering the famous Medici family crest on to the bag :) Note: Art not final.\n\nThis cardboard tile (approx 60x40x2mm) will help players keep track of whose turn it is to roll the dice. \n\nCardboard is nice, but wood is even better!\nAND: We also would like to say thank you for your support on social media. If our launch tweet gets 50 retweets, we will add 50 more score sheets to the game! Bonus!\nThanks to your love and support, we are pleased to announce that we will add 50 more score sheets again to Medici: The Dice Game!\nIf required, more stretch goals are planned to appear on this list during the campaign, however, we run streamlined KS campaigns where stretch goals are designed to make the quality of production better for backers, not to add extras that may blow out costs, timelines, and shipping prices. Backers can be confident that any additional game content that we may unlock during the campaign has been tested and budgeted and should not affect our production timetable.\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!\nBut that's not all...!\nIn celebration of this all-new addition to the Medici family, Grail Games is proud and pleased to offer all backers the chance to purchase and add-on (via the post-campaign pledge-manager) many of our previously released games by Reiner Knizia. This campaign is a great opportunity for you to complete your collection at discounted prices!\nMedici\nSince its first release in 1995, Reiner Knizia's Medici has come to be considered a modern classic of board games. By one of the world's most respected designers, and with stunning artwork by award-winning illustrator Vincent Dutrait, Grail Games was pleased to release a new, English edition of this famous auction game in 2016. Medici has become our flagship title and shows better than any other game how we like to \u201cremake it better!\u201d\nMedici is an auction game that takes place over three days (rounds). Players take turns presenting goods to be auctioned. Successful bidders will then load these goods onto the decks of their ships. Once all ships are full, or the deck of commodity cards is depleted, each day ends. Players then receive money for the value of the loads in their ships, and for how much of each commodity they have bought thus far. But be careful - the money you use to bid at auctions is also your end game points! After three days and three scorings, the player with the most money will win the game.\nMedici is quick to learn, smooth to play and full of player interaction.\nThe game contains\u2026\n1 full-color rule book\n1 game board (406 x 406mm)\n36 commodity cards - 7 each depicting cloth, fur, grain, dye and spice & 1 gold card (44 x 67mm)\n6 player aid cards\n6 large ship mats (250 x 100mm)\n2 smaller ship mats - to be used in the 2 player game (98 x 100mm)\n36 wooden playing counters (6 per player)\n5 commodity scoring counters\n2 day tracking counters\n1 start player token\n...all contained within a sturdy two-piece box (305 x 223 x 43mm)\nIf you would like to see what reviewers have thought about Medici, click on the links below!\n Rahdo Runs Thru Medici: \n Joel Eddy of Drive-Thru Reviews reviews Medici: \n Zee Garcia of The Dice Tower reviews Medici: \n\nMedici: The Card Game\nMedici: The Card Game shares the setting and feel of his classic Medici board game, without using that game's auction mechanisms.\nSet in 15th century Florence, players will try to acquire the most valuable goods for their merchant ships by drawing cards from a common deck. It is a set-collection card game with some push-your-luck elements. It is very easy to teach, learn and play.\nMedici: The Card Game is for 2-6 players ages 10 and up and takes 30 minutes, or so, to play.\nAfter re-releasing Medici the board game, Grail Games was very pleased to bring this terrific card game to life - the first to be added to the Medici family of games since Strozzi, released in 2008!\nThe game contains...\n110 commodity cards\n6 player aid cards\n50 shiny cardboard coins\n1 rulebook\n...All in a sturdy 2-piece box (150x150x43mm)\nIf you would like to see what reviewers have thought about Medici: The Card Game, click on the links below!\nRahdo\u2019s Final Thoughts:\n Zee of The Dice Tower reviews Medici: The Card Game: \n David of Grail Games shows you how to play: \nWant more...?!\nIf you would like to pledge for extra copies of Medici: The Dice Game, please add $29AUD for each extra copy you would like to your pledge total.

As the king travels along the road that connects all the major land-marks within his territory, he will allow the most influential noble in each region to govern in his stead. Over time, the most favored noble will win the game.\nKing\u2019s Road is for 2-5 players, ages 10+ and plays in 45 minutes.\nCRISS CROSS\nCriss Cross is a new roll-and-write game from Reiner Knizia that is both simple to learn and great fun to play.\nCriss Cross is for 1-6 players, ages 8+ and plays in 10 minutes.\nTo support our campaign and to help us fund Medici: The Dice Game is simple!

Since our first Kickstarter campaign was received EARLY by backers in January 2015, we have continued to send high quality products to backers on time! We have our systems well in place and use a top manufacturer to produce and ship quality games around the world. Grail Games is beginning to forge a track record of delivering fun games with quality components\u2026 on time!\n\nHowever, unforeseen circumstances can hold up a project. This can happen at the point of manufacture or during shipment. Grail Games has given a time-frame for delivery of Medici: The Dice Game that we believe is certainly achievable. If anything does affect the project, backers will be kept in the loop via regular backer updates at every step of the production and shipment process.\n\nNote that the currency conversions in the pledge level blurbs are a guide only. Currency values may fluctuate during the campaign.\n\nAlso note: Backers will receive the game at the best possible price and will receive their games before retail stores, but Grail Games cannot guarantee that retailers will not sell Medici: The Dice Game at a cheaper price than Kickstarter supporters will \u201cpay,\u201d especially months or years in the future.\n\nFinally, Grail Games will happily send replacement parts of any game damaged in shipment or due to manufacturing mishaps to backers, etc., but if backers fail to inform Grail Games of a change in shipping address or similar, backers may be asked to pay extra costs if they require a replacement copy of the game.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge AU$ 1 or more", "title": "ROLL WITH IT!", "descp": "Stay in touch by receiving all updates, access to the pledge manager after the campaign ends, and our thanks for your support!\n($1AUD = approx $0.75US / \u00a30.55 / \u20ac0.65)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2019"}], "stat": ["86 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 29 or more", "title": "MEDICI DICE", "descp": "Receive 1 copy of Medici: The Dice Game (with all unlocked stretch goals).

It's a bit like Codenames or Taboo, if the friend you were playing with had an encyclopedia and was also very, very drunk. It's a hilarious, smart and strategic game for people who own a Google Home or Amazon Alexa and have no idea what the heck to do with it.\nHey Robot is created by Everybody House Games \u2014 Hilary, Mara, Frank  and James Lantz. We're a family that's been making games for decades, including Universal Paperclips, Invisible Inc and Drop7. We've always been obsessed with board games and the funny ways we interact with technology in our day-to-day lives. Hey Robot is the intersection of those interests and the result of months of trying to invent fun things to do with our Alexa.\nHey Robot plays well with any group size, from 2 players up to as many people as you can fit around a flat surface. \nAt the beginning of the game, you deal out a grid of cards with words on them. Then teams alternate trying to capture a word by asking The Robot a question that will get them to say that word in their response. (They can't say any form of the word in their question.)\nFor example, Team 1 might pick VAMPIRE.  \n After a brief huddle, they decide to ask: \"Alexa, what is a creature that is scared of sunlight?\" hoping Alexa will say the word \"vampire\" in her response. Instead, she'll tell you about heliophobia \u2014 the fear of going out into the sun. Groan. Because they missed with their question,  Team 1 puts a bonus point token on the VAMPIRE card, increasing its value.\nNow it's Team 2's turn. After some deliberation, they choose VAMPIRE as well. They ask:  \"Alexa, who is Dracula?\" Alexa answers, \nBoom! Everyone cheers because Alexa said the word \"vampire\" in her response. Team 2 gets three points -- the two points printed on the card, plus the additional bonus point token. Now they must add a bonus point to one of the four cards touching the card they just captured. \nThey might choose GLASS because they think it's the hardest word to get, or they might choose MARSHMALLOW because they have an idea for how to capture it themselves. Now it's Team 1's turn again, and the game continues in this way until one team has earned 16 or more points and reigns victorious. \nThe game is really that simple. But while the rules are easy to understand, achieving a mind meld with your Robot can take a lifetime. Alexa and Google are both the smartest and stupidest people in the room, so asking the right question in the right way requires knowledge, cleverness and strategy. When you get it right there's cheering. When you get it wrong there's laughter, because the answer is usually hilarious.\n 400 word cards: The main event!  Each card is double-sided for a total of 800 words, painstakingly selected by our highly scientific methodology.* We've also assigned each word a point value in relation to its difficulty to make sure every game of Hey Robot has those dynamic highs and lows. \n 25 bonus point tokens: Stylish cardboard tokens.\n Scoring track: For keeping track of who's winning.\n 2 game pawns: For you to \"accidentally\" knock over when the winning team isn't looking. One black, one white. \n Hourglass timer: 30 seconds worth of sand. You won't have to use this every turn, but it's useful from time to time to keep the game moving along at a steady pace.\n Rule booklet: Tells you and your friends how to play the game. \n*Basically, we started with the entire English language and then narrowed it down to the ones that made us laugh or feel clever and weren't absurdly hard or way too easy. \nHey Robot does NOT include an Amazon Alexa or Google Home! You will need one of your own to play the game. \nHey Robot is easy to set up and explain to your friends, so you can start having a great time right out of the box! You'll laugh, you'll cheer and you'll finally have a use for your Robot that isn't just setting timers. \nA NOTE ABOUT SHIPPING\nOriginally, we only were offering shipping to US and Canada. We realized there was demand for international shipping and were able to open up shipping to many European countries and Australian/NZ.  We know the cost of international shipping is high, but we've tried to get these numbers as low as possible. Believe it or not, the prices we are charging for international shipping are lower than our actual costs. \nWHO ARE WE? \nEverybody House Games is a family company. Frank and James are professional video game developers, while Hilary and Mara chose to become actual productive members of society. But that means they don't get a hyperlink on their names in this Kickstarter, so who's laughing now? \nOur favorite board games have always been simple, fun and social \u2014 games like Hanabi, Codenames and Skull. We made Hey Robot in that tradition--it's the kind of game we always want to have around when we're hanging out.\nHey Robot is our company's first professional board game. Board games have been such an incredible and positive influence in all our lives and we're so pumped that we might get to add one of ours to the world. We're really grateful to be able to share this moment with you guys through this Kickstarter.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've been testing this game for over a year, so we've fine-tuned the design and know that playing the game is super fun. \n\nWe've also spent months working on the physical design of the box and the cards and are confident that we're going to be able to deliver a final product that looks great on your shelf and feels great to hold and play. \n\nThis will be our first time producing a board game but we're looking at various very professional printing and fulfillment solutions including AdMagic and Blackbox who have manufactured and fulfilled huge games like Cards Against Humanity, so we're in good hands. We don't have any complex gimmicks or fragile pieces so our manufacturing process is pretty straightforward.\n\nWe have several lifetimes of experience delivering polished and fun video games.

It also orders these by backers so we can see who's leading the way in their particular niche and who's up and coming.\nProjects from the same creator are grouped together so we can see how they've done through the year and the top 10% most backed projects include details of the top 3 reward levels.\nFor backers this makes Kickstarter much more browseable. Kickstarters search page is like an endless hotel corridor, this report is more like a shopping mall. By grouping projects within meaningful categories like Games Accessories - Dice we get fewer and more relevant recent projects with sufficient information to get a flavour for each one. With around 2000 projects this year it's easy to miss some, this report will help you find what you're interested in and possibly stuff you didn't even know existed.\nFor Creators it provides a useful insight into who your peers are. It's something like aerial photography, it gives you a clearer overview of how you fit within your chosen area. You can see what others are doing and how it's working out for them. It might even help you to explore other areas of the hobby and maybe find collaborators for your next project.\nThe aim of the report is to build a kind of road map of Kickstarter, or at least the little section of Tabletop Games so that projects go into an easily accessible archive and may get a little more exposure after the event itself.

You need to reduce your carbon footprint to the climate target of two tonnes per person before time runs out.\nYou start by selecting where you live which impacts your starting emissions:\nThen you select your lifestyle. This may not only change the starting emissions of the game but it is also a way of setting the difficulty level of the game. You can play at four different levels of difficulty; Normal, Tricky, Hard and Epic!\nThen you choose your characters. There are 16 different characters to play in the game, divided in to two categories; 12 regular Characters and 4 Gamers:\nMore characters will be unlocked if we hit the stretch goals\nYou can play as a group of friends or a family, even a single household. Each character has different abilities and resources that help them to beat the climate target.\nThere are three types of resources that help you reduce your carbon emissions; discipline, environmental commitment and finances. \n By using the resource cards you will try to complete climate missions. They come in four categories; transport, food, housing and other consumption:\n There are also external factors that influence us when we try to live more sustainably. For instance, there are political and financial instruments that try to nudge us in the right direction and help us change our lifestyle choices. And there are mechanisms that make it harder; like advertising, habits and social norms. These external factors are represented in the game by the Encouragement/Resistance cards which are activated during the more challenging climate missions:\nWhen you successfully complete a climate mission you get to reduce the carbon emissions on the board. When you have managed to reduce all emission categories to zero you have won the game. So you compete against the game and not the other players who you instead need to collaborate with to win the game.\n Tiny Footprint offers a great opportunity to have fun together and to cooperate to win the game, at the same time as you get to learn about which actions have the biggest impact on reducing your carbon emissions\nGame set up for a 4-player game\nTiny Footprint comes with an innate solo mode. There is no need for an AI, separate Automa deck or anything like that. You just follow the player count rules in the rule book and gain access to more action pawns and mission cards and play just like you would in a game with multiple players.\nFurthermore, to give the game high replayability there are, alongside the multiple characters to play that all have unique abilities, four levels of difficulty to play; Normal, Tricky, Hard and Epic. This will allow you to replay the game and get a harder challenge each time you play.\nBoth social goals have been reached and the cards will be included in the game\nRule Book in English (German and Spanish versions through Print and Play)\nClick the meeple to go to the full review\nClick the logo to go to the full review\nDo you and your gaming group want to be in the game? Or maybe put a few friends or family members in the game and give it is a gift? Then the Mega Face pledge is for you. When we reach out to you after the campaign ends all you need to do is to send us up to 4 pictures of the faces you would like to get personalized character cards for. And the name of the character and the accompanying flavor text. We will then \"cartoonize\" those faces and you will have unique and personalized character cards for your game nights!\nExample of the \"cartoonizing\" of a photo and how it is put on a personalized Character Card\n We will charge for shipping once the campaign is over. For this, we will use a pledge manager (Gamefound). A pledge manager is a tool that will help us collect all of your shipping information so we can deliver the game to you without any mishaps or delays. Shipping is expensive but we will subsidize part of the cost of shipping to you. Since we will use shipping partners in the EU (and the UK should Brexit happen), Canada and the US you will not have to worry about paying additional taxes or duties in those regions. \nThe table below shows the final shipping cost for one copy of Tiny Footprint. (The personalized character cards in the Mega Face pledge will be sent separately with free shipping).\n If you are a retailer and would like to offer Tiny Footprint to your customers at your store please contact marcus@gaardgames.com.\nThere is no big company behind this game. Really just one person with an idea and a game that I am trying to bring to life. Since making and shipping a board game to lots of different countries is expensive I need the funds to be able to do it and also to ensure that there are enough people who want to play this game. That is why I use Kickstarter to try to raise the funds necessary to make this game a reality.\nA Kickstarter campaign is an all or nothing campaign. This means that the money you back this project with will only be charged in the event the campaign reaches its target. If it does not reach its target no money will be drawn from your card account. \n As I am making a board game about sustainable lifestyles and choices I want to address the sustainability aspect of the product I am trying to make a reality.\nAnd if your question is; Isn't it more sustainable not to buy this board game? And the answer is yes. From a strict resource perspective it would be better not to buy this game. Having said that, I still want to make this game a reality and here are the reasons why:\nFirst and foremost, it is a board game and not a sustainability product. And although this hobby does produce thousands of games every year, the footprint of one board game for one household is extremely small compared to the other lifestyle choices we make when it comes to our diet, how we travel and where we travel. The difference the choices we make is the core take-away from playing this game\nSecondly, my hope is that when people play this game it will generate interesting discussions around the choices we make and how they impact our climate. Hopefully it can inform and help some of the players to make more sustainable choices in the future. That is the real sustainability impact of the game\nWhy the focus on individual lifestyle choices and not governments and corporations? This game focuses on a household and our individual choices. Clearly we need government and corporate commitments alongside technological innovation to meet the climate target. But our individual lifestyle choices will also play a key role in a more sustainable future.\nWe have tried to produce this in the most sustainable way possible but still with an eye on cost. So this means that it is produced with recycled paper and cardboard and almost no plastic. But it is produced in China due to the cost-prohibitive nature of producing it locally in Sweden (where we are based)\nIn conclusion, this product can help people with having conversations around living sustainably but it is a board game and not a sustainability product.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our second Kickstarter project. The first one was a Swedish only Kickstarter which was successfully produced and delivered ahead of time. We have also delivered a retail version of that board game to over 40 stores across Sweden and have run an International consumer goods company from which we have extensive experience when it comes to production, logistics, shipping and customs. \n\nThe art and mechanics for this game are completed and all we need to do is to press go and our partners will start producing the game. We are confident that we will be able to deliver a great product to you on time.\n\nThat said, we will use partners to bring this idea to life; e.g. manufacturing, freight forwarding, 3rd parties like the US Post Office, and FEDEX to ship the games to you \u2013 we don't control everything but will do everything we can to get this game in to your hands on time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge SEK 10 or more", "title": "Tiny Backer", "descp": "(Approximately $1 US) Show us support for the project!\nINCLUDES:\nPrint and Play-version of the game.\nGain access to the Pledge Manager", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}], "stat": ["155 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge SEK 300 or more", "title": "Mega Backer", "descp": "(Approximately $30 US) One physical copy of the Tiny Footprint board game, plus all unlocked stretch goals.\nThis does not include shipping.

We have recently published our 55th Wallet Game and wanted to revisit some favorites that have run low or out of stock. This campaign will work a little differently than our usual campaigns. Here we will start with 3 fan favorites and as stretch goals are hit, we will add more games to the print run. With each stretch goal, we will invite you to help vote for the next game that we add. With each new game, we will add a new reward level allowing backers to get all of the games at these Kickstarter discounted prices. \nTHE FOLLOWING GAMES ARE AVAILABLE AS OF NOW:\n Mint Julep by Dan Letzring\n Pentaquark by Mike Mullins\n Pickpockets by Isaac Shalev & Matt Loomis\n Avignon: A Clash of Popes by John Du Bois\n Avignon: Pilgrimage by John Du Bois\n Stew by Jason Glover\n Twin Stars: Adventure Series I by Jason Tagmire & Mike Mullins\n Twin Stars: Adventure Series II by Jason Tagmire & Mike Mullins\n Turbo Drift by Rob Cramer\n The Maiden In The Forest by Todd Sanders\n  Cunning Folk by Jay Treat\n  Banned Books by Jason Tagmire\nPlus a bunch of expansions! See the latest updates for details on how to add the expansions. \nLet's jump into the available games!\nYou are in attendance of an amazing horse race and your goal is to end up with the most points by the end of the race. In Mint Julep,  players draft cards, place bets and then manipulate the race in order  to ensure the horse that they want to win ends up finishing the race in a  top spot. Be careful where you place your bet because the odds might be against you!\nEach game is played in 3 Rounds that each consist of three phases: drafting cards for your hand, betting on which horse you think will win, playing movement cards to adjust the order of the horses in the race.\nFinal scoring is based on where horses start in the race (horses  starting in lower positions are worth more points), where horses end in  the race (more points earned for higher place finishers), and when a bet  was played (with later bets being worth less than earlier bets). Score the highest points with your bet and you win!\nSome of the biggest questions in the world of science may be answered by  studying quarks, the smallest of particles. The problem with trying to study quarks is that you can\u2019t find just one quark; you need to find them in groups called hadrons, or some other exotic particles, like the Pentaquark.\nIn Pentaquark, you are trying to give  science a little helping hand by collecting the five quarks that form  this particle at the detector of a massive particle collider. Move cards  you need to the detector, discard others so they may come back as  anti-quarks, and try to minimize the number of quarks scattered and  lost. If too many cards are removed from the game, the Pentaquark has  slipped through undetected once again!\nAll  players play as thieves who are pulling bills out of a wallet stuffed with cash. What none of them know, is any player may be an undercover cop, trying to catch as many thieves as possible.\nIn Pickpockets, players will take turns  either drawing or manipulating money cards in a wallet until a player  reveals themselves as an undercover cop, yelling \u201cHands up\u201d. All other  players will reveal their cards.\nThe Undercover Cop Wins if at least one other player has two or more marked bills in their possession. Otherwise the Pickpocket with the most money wins. Alternatively a player can skip town if they have enough unmarked money in their possession.\nAvignon is a quick influence manipulation card  game in which the two players  are rival candidates for Pope in the 14th  century. Players gain  influence by petitioning members of the medieval  Church, such as  Cardinals, Nobles, and Knights, and using the  characters' unique powers  to pull the character cards over to their side  of the table (their  congregation), or force an opponent to push cards  towards them. The  first player to get three characters into their  congregation wins.\nStew is a press-your-luck, partial knowledge game. You and your fellow players take on the role of a farmer collecting items from the garden to make a stew. There are six vermin that want to eat your stew before you do. Draw a card and add it to your stew or feed some of the vermin to protect your pot. Make sure you do not wait too long, or your  fellow farmers might eat your stew.\nTwo cosmic adventurers are in a tricky scenario and must work  together. By rolling and manipulating dice for special abilities and  combos, you can be the one that guides them to victory.\nTwin Stars solo system by Jason Tagmire and Mike Mullins. A session uses just 3 cards and players provide their own dice and  coins/tokens. Scenarios and characters can be  interchanged  with others for a very different gaming experience. Twin Stars: Adventure Series I is a collection of 6 Twin Stars scenarios and 12 characters, making for 396 unique combinations and tons of solo replayability.\nR-R-R-R-Race toward the finish line at ludicrous speed! In Turbo Drift,  you must make your way through an analog racecourse full of obstacles by drafting movement cards from columns or rows or even pushing-your-luck and try to use all the movement cards. Turbo Drift will make a big presence on your gaming table with obstacle cards and  nitro-infused gameplay, yet small enough to put in your pocket for some  lunchtime gaming.\nTurbo Drift is a real-space racing game for 2-4 players that takes  30 minutes to play. Players will take turns picking 1,2,or 3 path cards from a grid to navigate their cars closer to  the goal card. Once per  game, they can go turbo, using all of the cards in the grid to drive. The first player to cross the finish line wins!\nLong ago, a maiden mage was trapped in an  enchanted forest ring. Through her cunning, and with the help of four magic objects, she attempts to escape her fate.\nThe Maiden in the Forest is an 18-card  solitaire game using only cards. The rules are contained  within the 18 cards. The object of the game is to rotate, then turn  over, each of the  twelve tree cards from their blooming to dormant side. If you can do  this before the end of the twelve clock cycles of  day and night, you win  your freedom.\nRival witch covens have been warring for the souls of Ipswich's townsfolk for years, but it ends now. You\u2019ve been tasked to search home by home to find the witches and end this feud.\nCunning Folk is a micro game of bluffing  and deduction. You are townsfolk, investigating the houses of Ipswich for witches, good and evil. Look at a card and tell your friends  which character you see to use its ability. Of course, you could lie.  Your opponents might call you out, but everyone should tread carefully: Wrong  once, and the town suspects you of witchcraft. Twice, and you  are ostracized! Keep your wits about you and\u2014if you lie, do it well.\nIt is the hope of every literary character that their tale will inspire people for generations to come. But how can people be inspired by your story if it\u2019s on the banned books list? Your story MUST be told, and it's time for you to take matters into  your own hands!\nBanned Books is a solo game featuring ousted literary characters  fighting back against the Powers-That-Be to restore their books to the shelves. Each turn you will select actions that will progress your agenda track, hamper the agenda tracks of the Powers, utilize your characters unique abilities or manipulate your tableau. If you can   advance your progress token quickly enough to convince 2 of the Powers-That-Be to remove your book from the banned list, you win. But if the majority of the Powers advance their tokens and make up their minds first, or drain your characters stamina, you will be banished from shelves forever!\nWe normally don't do stretch goals, but it's the entire point of this campaign! Each stretch goal will unlock a new game, which backers will vote for in the comments. When a new game is unlocked it becomes part of the pool of games you can choose from at the end of the campaign. Keep an eye on the updates to vote for your favorites! Here are some potential stretch goal games (and even more that aren't shown here). \nWe will pick about 3 at a time and ask you to vote for your favorite through the updates here. But feel free to start discussing your favorite games in the comments. \nNOTE: With 2 days left, we've locked the Stretch Goals!

Supporters will receive from $1, $2, $5 to $10 off of EVERY WALLET GAME THAT WE MAKE. (See the $1 level here, that's where the members back the projects).\nIn 2019 supporters received Chain Mail (a solo and co-operative dungeon crawl system), Tempus Quest (a not quite roll and write), as well as 9 card micro games, expansion / promo cards for our existing games, and at $20 a month, supporters receive all of the above and a copy of the featured wallet game (or the wallet game of your choice). \nBut we're getting close to 2020 where we shift things a bit.  There are a few new monthly games that will be revealed on December 1st, as well as some of the additional content to expect. I can only say that we have a big long awaited expansion planned for one game, and 4(!) expansions planned for another game. There's also a new line of extra tiny games in the works, which will work their way into the club next year. \nIf that sounds cool to you, check out the Board Game of the Month Club on Patreon!\nhttp://www.patreon.com/buttonshy", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith our method of publishing and using multiple manufacturers, there's always a chance that one part of the game could come in with an error, leading to delays.

Bulk is when we assemble a ton of packages that are exactly the same, print a ton of labels and place them on top. It doesn't matter which label goes on a package, as they are all the same. With these, one person can do about 50-100 an hour. We have a 5 person team, usually 2 per day. So we could get through 300 in a day.

Cover parking lots and abandoned buildings with parks and museums and make sure you have offices in the prestigious skyscrapers at the heart of the Zoned Out metropolis. This light strategy game by Keith Rentz provides a unique gaming experience that is as beautiful to look at as it is fun to play.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nWe've decided to try something a bit different with this campaign.  Due to the nature of the game, there isn't much to be done for stretch goals.  Instead, we have opted to offer the game at a significant discount off of the retail of $39.99.  In addition, we are giving all the exclusive content we have for the game up front.\nThe 6 promotional Secret Goal cards that come with your Kickstarter edition of Zoned Out will not be available in retail.\nCost:  While we would love to offer free shipping, there really is no such thing. Shipping is really expensive and we have tried to come up with pricing that accurately reflects our cost to get the game into your hands without creating a logistical nightmare on our side. There's a lot of plastic pieces and awesome game to pack up here, and that doesn't make it any cheaper. Your shipping will be added in the pledge manager.  We expect that we'll have to come out of pocket a bit based on what we are charging and we are ok with that.\nTracking: We will also be using non-trackable shipments in some cases in order to save on cost as tracking can add 30-50% or more in some cases. So please understand if we do not have tracking with your package we did so knowingly. Rest assured, that we will get you your game and any risk associated with a package not being trackable is on us.\nDelivery time: While we would love to get everyone their games at the same time, it is just not possible. There is a high likelihood that some areas of the world will get their games before others. Our commitment is to get the games ready and printed as fast as possible (we've already done a ton of the prep work). \nThe fine print stuff:\nWhat does \"Exclusive\" mean? You've probably noticed we do not say Kickstarter Exclusive but rather show a logo with our image (or another company image) and the word exclusive.  What this means is that these items will never be available in retail and only through us or the company depicted on the logo.  However, while they may be available from us in the future, they will most certainly not be given away for free.  In most cases, the cost of putting together the same package you might back in our campaign is 50% more or higher afterward.\nOther: Lastly, we will be using fulfillment companies in different parts of the world and while we have done our best to ensure we pick good ones, ultimately, once the games get into their warehouses there is little control we have at that point. We have always done our best to bend over backwards for our customers and if for some reason there are any issues with damages, missing components or missing shipments we will make it right. It just might require some patience.\nWhy back this campaign? While we have had great success with other games like Deception: Murder in Hong Kong and Champions of Midgard, we are still a relatively small company and we just do not have the funds needed to fund every project we do without some help. Your pledge gets you all the exclusive unlocked content which will not be available in retail... only through us.  Plus, if you live in the U.S the game will be in your hands before someone can get it from an online retailer.  Lastly, we expect the standard retail version of the game to be $40 MSRP, which won't get any of the cool exclusives that you'll get on this campaign.  If you live outside the U.S, we will do our best to get it into your hands first.

Originally published by Mayfair Games in 2004, Station Master has long been favored for its high player interaction, clever decisions, and fun gameplay.  We couldn\u2019t think of a better way to continue Calliope Games' 10 year anniversary celebration than by refreshing and publishing one of our favorite games - so we welcome you to the launch of the new and improved Station Master!  \nStation Master is a train-themed card game for 2-6 players.  In the game, players are working at the station, attaching railcars to Locomotives and boarding passengers on trains, trying to score the most Efficiency Points to win!\nWe have restored this timeless train game, creating stunning all-new artwork based on classic locomotives, railcars, and railroad history.  In addition, we have refined and streamlined the rules for modern audiences, as well as adding in upgrades and new material to create the greatest possible Station Master experience!\nPLAY\n\nCalliope Games has used Kickstarter ever since 2012, bringing to life a library of amazing games: Tsuro of the Seas, Roll For It!, Dicey Peaks, The Mansky Caper, Running With The Bulls, Hive Mind, Menu Masters, Ancestree, ShutterBug, Capital City, ShipShape, Everyone Loves A Parade, SpyMaster, and Tsuro: Phoenix Rising!  We love this community and this platform!\nExclusive Deluxe Box and Alternate Passenger Pawns Not Available In Retail Version After The Campaign!\nWe invite you to be the first to board the train and take a ride! Station Master will be available after release through distribution to retailers, but through this Kickstarter campaign, you can pledge for the Executive Class edition of the game, featuring improvements and exclusives not found in the retail version of the game.  The 36 exclusive Passenger pawn shapes and flip-top magnetic-close box in the Executive Class edition of the game will not be available through distribution after this campaign. \nEvery Tuesday and Thursday as we ride the rails through the campaign, we will reveal a FEATURED LOCOMOTIVE POSTCARD that will packaged in with the Executive Class version of the game! These are actual postcards that can be collected or mailed to a train enthusiast you know!  While not a gameplay element, each set of nine postcards is a wonderful free add-on for this beautiful game!\nMan vs Meeple\nNever Bored Gamers\nSAHM Reviews\nThe Dice Tower with Mark & Randy\nWe are offering subsidized shipping costs in order to strike the best balance of value for our backers and actual cost to us. We have strategically partnered with trusted fulfillment partners around the world experienced in shipping Kickstarter rewards.\n10 years ago, Calliope Games began as a collaboration between Dawne Weisman, Jordan Weisman, and Ray Wehrs. All of us are experienced game industry professionals who have worked together since 1999 when we collectively launched WizKids. Calliope Games has been producing and selling quality tabletop games since 2009. Our products are inspired by family for families. To date we have released 24 titles, many of which were brought to life here on Kickstarter!\nAt Calliope Games, we publish fun, affordable, family-style tabletop games for all to enjoy.\nWith gamers in mind, our games make the perfect \"gateway\" or \"filler\" game. They allow you to easily draft your non-gamer friends into your favorite hobby. Calliope games are excellent for starting out game night and are easily played between heavier games. It\u2019s important to point out to our non-gamer friends that we do take a slightly different approach to the games we produce. At Calliope, we focus on entertaining adults; however, the games we produce allow children to compete with their parents without the parents \u201cthrowing\u201d the game. It\u2019s a really a pretty simple concept; instead of having the parents step down into the child\u2019s world, we are inviting the child to step up into the parents' world.\nFor gamers and non-gamers alike, the results of our efforts are games that are accessible by all players regardless of skill level or age, play in under 60 minutes, are affordably priced, and most of all\u2026 are a blast to play!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith any venture, there are risks... those that are seen, and those that are unseen. The biggest foreseeable risks we currently face are manufacturing in China and shipping issues from China to our warehouse here in the US.\n\nEach of these risks is greatly minimized with Calliope Games. Our factories have been with us for many years. They know how we work and the quality we expect. In addition, our freight forwarder and fulfillment teams are world class and have over 30 years of expertise to rely upon. If any issues arise, we will know of them far in advance and will be able to overcome them.\n\nNew tariffs may influence costs as well. Typically these are 10%-25% of our total manufacturing cost. Should tariffs affect prices, these will be reflected in the post-campaign shipping and fulfillment cost.\n\nAs far as the unseen risks... we know they are there and we have built a safety margin into our costs of goods sold to prepare us for the unforeseen. To date we've launched more than 20 games under the Calliope brand, many with a good number of reprints, and we have overcome all major production issues in providing our players quality entertainment experiences.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Grand Central (Retailer)", "descp": "FOR VERIFIED BRICK-AND-MORTAR GAME STORES ONLY.

They require no pocket or belt to provide you with an easy and safe solution for carrying your cards, phone or passport.  \nWe've taken the idea of a running belt and transformed the concept into something completely new and different; then expanded on the idea from a way to carry a phone while running to wallets and passport holders. \nThe One80 Pouch is the first stand alone pouch that can be added to a waistline (with or without a belt) with no need for a belt, pocket, magnets or velcro. This pouch makes it possible for you to carry those day to day necessities with ease. Each pouch lays discretely against your waist with little to no show. \n Compare the old way to the newly reinvented One80 Pouch way!\nCarrying your cell phone, cards or passport has never been so easy. \nIn developing the One80 Pouches we poured over reviews to figure out the good and bad of all comparable items. Zippers are the number one breaking point of running belt and fanny packs. Magnets are potentially dangerous to cell phones and velcro often loses its stick after time. So, we set out to find a way to develop the pouches without any of these to improve user experience and convenience. \n No one likes sitting on a wallet. It's uncomfortable and annoying. \nMinimal wallet are great. Better than a large traditional wallet. Yet the problem remains.  You have have to keep in a pocket. Do you deal with having it in a back pocket and the bother of sitting on it? Or keep it in a front pocket and contend with the front pocket bulge? \nDave, who has been testing testing the card holder wallet prototype said,\n\"I went to using a minimal wallet a year ago. From there I started keeping it in my front pocket to avoid having to sit on it. That was better than a back pocket.                                             But THIS wallet is a GAME CHANGER.\" \nFanny packs and running belts are great; but what if you don't want to carry that bulky thing? Or just want something more discrete? One80 Pouch is for you. Perfect to carry your phone on a run and inconspicuous enough to wear with almost anything out to a movies or dinner. Wearing leggings or jeans? With or without a belt? You can comfortably wear any of these with the One80 Pouches.   \n\nIn front, in back, on the side? Or maybe partially on the side or somewhere in between. Wear your pouch how you like.  \nEven if you're not wearing it on you waist it's perfect for the inner pocket of your backpack or purse. Have you ever lost your wallet to bottom depths of a bag? Use your pouch to keep it attached inside the bag exactly where you need it. \n Inconspicuously wear your One80 Pouch wherever life takes you. \nTrue functionality happens so easily you don't have to think about it. Carrying items can be cumbersome and an obstruction. The One80 Pouch is truly functional. You can wear it to the gym and it won't get in the way of your workout. Wear it running and it will disappear into your running experience. It's time to leave those bulky phone holders that demand continual adjustment behind. \nThe easy attached clips make putting on your One80 Pouch super easy. The clips are smooth and super low profile so they won't bother or annoy you while wearing your pouch. The design was tested over and over to ensure easy attachment and removal, yet tight enough grip and hold securely.\nLess is better, especially when talking about comfort. And that's exactly what your going to get with your One80 Pouch; comfort. So much less to worry about and be bothered by. \nNo belt. No bulky over-sized  bag. No straps covered in velcro. No magnets to hold it on. No zipper to fuss with. Pure and simple comfort.\nWhat makes these pouches so different from every other wallet, phone or passport holder? The easy on easy off propriety clips. So simple, yet made with precision to ensure your pouch will easily slip on to a waistline or belt, will hold secure, and then can be removed easily. \nDoesn't seem that difficult right? That's what we thought at first too.\nWe spent a year trying different ways of making this work and tested hundreds of clip variations. With each rendition removing or adding millimeters at a time and subtle shape modification before finally at what you see today. \nAttach under for extra secure connection\nAdditional backside sleeve can be used as belt sleeve\n\n\nCash Sleeve\n\nSome of first steps were to figure out a pouch or bag system. We went through various types fabrics and materials. Tried velcro, zippers and magnets before ultimately deciding we wanted to simplify the pouch as much as possible and eliminate these different  materials; as most of them were leading causes for issues in other bags and belts. \nWe knew the key to make this concept work would be and effective clip. This proved to be the most difficult part of the building process. After various concepts and the slightest adjustment of 1/2 mm at a time we arrived at the clip we felt accomplished what we had set out to do.\n Lots and lots of 3D printing and design lead us to the clips we came to today. Testing each along the way for it's capabilities and function. Our industrial sewing machine and 3D printer got a lot of use during those months.

Trace connections between the flora and fauna you discover as the Beagle journeys through the islands. Find help from the ship\u2019s crew and uses for the tools in your luggage.  Excel in your research and lead the way among your naturalist colleagues. \nOn the Origin of the Species is a tile laying game that\u2019s simple to learn but driven by deep decisions. Players will take the role of scientist naturalists on the HMS Beagle as it journeys through the Galapagos Islands. On each player\u2019s turn, they may either research the surrounding species in their habitats or discover the natural history of a new species.\nTo Research: a player will place two of their observation cubes on different species found among the islands. These observations contribute to their understanding of how the species relate to their habitats.\nTo Discover: a player must spend observation cubes in play to place a new species tile on an adjacent spot on the board.  The previously observed species help the scientist understand the new one.  The discovering player will receive victory points and the community of scientists gain new research possibilities.\nThe players\u2019 discoveries will also grant them cards that provide extra abilities or scoring opportunities, as they gain help from the crew of the Beagle or their array of naturalist tools on board.\n\nEach newly discovered species causes the Beagle to leave one island for another. The Beagle\u2019s progress will trigger scoring opportunities and, eventually, the end of the game.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter production is complete, we'll be shipping the game worldwide through several fulfillment centers, ensuring that we have \"Friendly Shipping\" (no import taxes) to the US, EU, Canada, and Australia.

You will be building and expanding a human colony on an alien planet. You will experience a new milestone in the fusion of classic board game design, inventive electronic modules, and its companion app.\nNew components in the box - click here!\nIn Beyond Humanity: Colonies, players take on the roles of managers of a new settlement built on a distant exoplanet by refugees from a future Earth that is polluted and overpopulated. As a manager, you will propose and vote on new modules to be built, introduce decrees to define the culture and functionality of the colony, carry out planetary exploration and research to obtain valuable artifacts, gather resources, and gain public support from the colonists.\nThis is a semi-cooperative game, which means you will have to cooperate to keep the colony operational and self-sufficient, while at the same time competing to gain influence and make decisions on the direction of the colony's development based on your individual victory goals. If the colony fails, you all lose, but if it succeeds, there will only be one true winner.\nBeyond Humanity: Colonies is a hybrid board game like you've never seen before: it is an unprecedented combination of a traditional board game combined with electronic miniatures that are supported by a linked app.\nAs board game enthusiasts, our team believes that an app should never take the player's attention away from the board. As engineers and designers, we fought to change the way software is used and can be a part of an exciting tabletop experience.\nDuring the game, the app serves as a self-operating data slate that enhances the classic and traditional board game experience. It displays the status of the colony and its citizens and does not require any interaction asides from clicking \u201cnext\u201d at the end of turn. Instead, the game gathers information about your actions on its own! Thanks to the CPU built into the central piece of the game, the app recognizes when the new buildings are connected to it and it can recognize smart cards with the RFID technology built into modules. The miniature buildings will communicate their status with you by flashing lights of different colors. The application on your smartphone or tablet is connected wirelessly to the colony itself and will display all the important information like the current resource statuses and the status of the residents.\nOn top of it all, hidden behind the scenes, there is a neural network implemented that simulates moods, opinions, and the current feelings of thousands of virtual citizens.\nThe purpose of putting all this tech into this board game is that it does the complex calculations for you, so you can fully focus on what happens above the table - convincing other players to assist your vision of the colonies future and the race for the upcoming presidential election of this newly born colony!\nThanks to many suggestions and feedback, all the cards and module tiles will be made color-blind-friendly by adding special icons, so any part of the game will no longer be color coded only.\nMore videos will be added soon!\nThere are three important aspects you will be able to experience:\nMultiple modes:\nEndless replayability:\n5 difficulty levels\n9 unique Managers to choose from\n34 private and common goals\nOver 500 monthly occurrences\n700 000 exoplanets to visit\nBranching Metagame:\nSearch for new planets between your games\nAfter winning a game, gain Auxiliary Fleets that can be used to colonize more challenging planets\nOutcome of your game is a part of global supply market, that affects the prices of the resources imported in forthcoming games\nPlanned after release: your actions affect every player, not just those sitting around your table!\nThe game design is complex enough, so there is no need to complicate the campaign. We decided not to cut the game into pieces in order to make expansions or partial pledges. There is only one basic pledge with one game box, and there is only one game box configuration that you can get.\nYou will then get the core box, which is the complete game - and this is what you will receive:\nIn Beyond Humanity: Colonies we've strived to make the game feel like a regular board game, where players focus on the gameplay:\nCollecting goods and using various effect cards\nNegotiating and making votes\nPlanning future decisions\nChoosing whether to focus on the Colony or personal goals\nForming and breaking alliances\nSearching for artifacts\nAt the same time, the game CPU along with the companion app will calculate different variables and run the colony simulation, including up to 15,000 individual citizens. Players won't need to worry about this aspect, as the current status of the colony, resources, and population will always be visible on the screen. Other than that, the only time players must interact with an app - is when they press the 'next' button at the end of turn.\nIf you manage to survive long enough, or your Colony will grow over required limits, the game ends successfully and you will feel like winners. Then compare your victory points and you will discover who has won the game individually.\nThe main semi-coop mode is completed, but there will also be a fully cooperative mode, as well as a solo mode. A semi-coop (\u201ccampaign mode\u201d as we call it) is already balanced and tested. For more info on other modes, please visit our social media and sign up for our newsletter on our website.\nWhen making pledge, you add the proper amount of money for the add-ons of your choice to the pledge. Then you will choose it in the pledge manager, after the campaign closes.\nBeyond Humanity is about leaving a dying earth, but it doesn\u2019t mean we want to see it that way anytime soon. Actually we hope that space exploration will be an open-minded path of curiosity, not a necessity to survive.\nTherefore, our team decided to carefully design the product in a way that would have minimal possible environmental impact. Electronics are made according to the RoHS standards, are lead-free, and recyclable. Plastic modules are made with ABS and polycarbonate, which are also recyclable. If after 10 or more years you will decide to throw our game away (although we hope you will not), please put it in the proper recycling bins to give it another life, maybe even as parts for future space colonization.\nSecondly, we decided to keep all production and suppliers in Europe and in the USA. It would affect the price but there are things more important that simple economy. We decided to keep away from producing in and importing from China, because we believe in the value of human work paid with fair wages and that things we buy should be made in a fair work environment.\nFurthermore, European and American manufacturers can give a better guarantee of planet-friendly production process and geographical shortening of the supply line would decrease the carbon footprint.\nAll module minis are to be manufactured and delivered paint ready. You will be able to disassemble the buildings, take out the electronics and the optical fiber, and paint it anyway you wish or ask your favourite artist to do so. \nIt is strongly recommended to express your vision on the colony look and get your minis painted that way, as future galleries on the game website and awarded contests are expected. \n\"Under construction\" - two modules (Cryogenics and Spaceport) which are going to be designed and sculpted during or after the campaign.\nThe players' characters in the game are the Managers of the colony. Each of them has a different approach, with a personal history, individual goals, and unique directives to match their strategies and affect the colony development -  your choice of manager will significantly change your game experience every time.\nThere are currently 4 Managers, fully introduced and balanced. In the final game, there will be 9 of them (or 10 if one of you decide to join by backing the highest pledge).\nClick here to read about Beyond Humanity story and lore.\nTo give you a well-balanced game our team has spent the last two years testing this game. There were hundreds of internal tests performed, but most important and valuable were the tests with multiple gaming groups. We have been at Gen Con twice, visited countless players in Poland, spend many evenings with fellow friends which gave us an awesome and invaluable feedback.\nTHANK YOU!\nFrom mid-2018, subsequent Alpha, Beta and Gamma versions were tested intensively. There were literally hundreds of internal tests and way over 100 full-length games with our supporters. Thanks to that, the game was improved by many gameplay changes and multiple bugfixes. Finally, the game has been balanced - for example, the winning ratio for managers is shown below:\nCurrently we are working on two companion apps: one for Android system and second one for Apple iOS. First one is going to be available in Google Play Store (and also as a standalone APK, see below), the second one in Apple AppStore. We are aiming at giving you comfortable experience with smartphones and tablets - low end to high tech ones.\nInternet isn\u2019t needed to play this game. It is required for updating and using metagame functions, downloading new scenarios, taking part in player-to-player marketplace and community goals. But to play a game you don\u2019t need to use the internet!\nThe short video below will show you how easy it is to start a new colony on an alien exoplanet.\nAs we know that the lack of mandatory companion app will render this game useless we have prepared for unforeseen adversities:\nWe are planning additional version of Companion App (beside of iOS / Android) on Steam for PC platform.\n   APK (Android executable file) will be available for manual download and redistribution from first day of deliveries, and we will keep updating it with new versions.\n  We are planning giving our full description of our API (Application Protocol Interface) responsible for \u201ctalking\u201d with our hardware via Bluetooth, so creation of third party apps will be possible.\n  Thanks to open-minded approach we all should feel secure that Beyond Humanity: Colonies won\u2019t become abandonware in future!\nTo fully enjoy our game and not feel as though you\u2019ll risk your money on a next-generation electronic hybrid board game, you need to feel safe about any possible malfunctions. Although we will do our best in choosing the best quality components, we don\u2019t want you to worry that any misfortune would keep you from exploring new worlds with us.\nThe game will be covered by a two year warranty, according to European Union law. \nWe will also provide you with long-term support, including software updates, app updates for new versions of iOS and Android, spare parts delivery, and a helpdesk.\nOur team members have many years of experience in providing the same support in highly specialized hardware production, so we are confident that you will be served properly.\nFor the pledge fulfillment and game delivery, you will be served by trusted partners that have worked with many big titles and already gained their experience and professional reputation:\nPledge manager\n Game On Tabletop (http://www.gameontabletop.com) the team has been making games possible through crowdfunding since 2013 and have fulfilled/founded over 170 projects to date, with over 50,000 backers satisfied. With their professional care, you can feel safe that everything will go smooth after the project is over.\nFulfillment center\n Green Logistics (http://green-logistics.pl/eng/) known for delivery of such titles as: This War Of Mine: The Board Game,  Lords of Hellas, Tainted Grail, and many other games produced and shipped from Poland and Europe.\nShipping will be charged after the Kickstarter finishes based on actual costs incurred to ship and is collected via a pledge manager system. This allows us to charge each backer fairly and avoid a 'one size fits all' mentality to shipping.\nBelow are our initial rough estimates for shipping the core game (4kg volumetric weight). Please note that these are just estimates - costs may rise due to weight increase as more items are unlocked via stretch goals and add-on purchases you choose. We will be charging these costs based on the actual cost of shipping, and collect it through the pledge manager after the campaign ends.\nThe following list will be updated before the start of the campaign:\n* -Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Cyprus, Ukraine, Japan, South Korea, Singapur, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Mexico, Brasil.\nFull list: USA, Canada, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Cyprus, Ukraine, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Mexico, Brazil.\nIf you are in a country that is not on our available shipping list, please contact us so you can inform us of your country and we can check with our fulfillment manager Green Logistics, on a case by case basis, if we have a suitable delivery system to ensure you receive your package.\nWe are 'Three Headed Monster', a small self-publishing venture of people that we were not game developers before, but a group of gamers with different professional skills: coders, designers, hardware engineers and entrepreneurs. This project is a love child of the entire team. A long and rocky road has lead to this moment when a dream became the real product and happy bunch of friends became a company.\nThere\u2019s more of us!\nMore than a dozen of experts and problem solvers are involved in our project: electronics designers, testers, consultants, graphic designers\u2026 This project is swallowing manhours like a whale chewing through krill!\nWe want to make strong and solid statement that all employees and coworkers are EU or USA citizens.\nThe refund would be possible within 14 days after the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After this time, refunds could be paid minus the Kickstarter fee and payment processing fees, as we cannot claim them back.\nWhen the packaging of your pledge for shipment will begin (around 6 to 8 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds would be possible.\nIf a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we will refund that completely, including fees.\nAll refunds after 14 days from the close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials, and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8-week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. We do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, some specific items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.\nWe regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\nIf you do not accept the proposed terms please do not pledge on this Kickstarter project.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe know that we are a small company and this is our first product. But we can assure you that we are a group of experienced professionals in different fields and many of us have already successfully finalized Kickstarter campaigns in other areas, such as specialized hardware.\n\nWe are perfectly aware of the challenges that might occur in the process.\nMost crucial areas are:\n\n1. Production - our game is a much more complicated product that traditional board games, many things can happen on the electronics parts market, prices can change or CPUs surplus may get depleted. But we know the market, we have chosen a reliable European and American manufacturers and suppliers, and we are as sure as possible that the production will be done as expected. We have experience in specialized product campaigns - for example, part of our team successfully delivered a BeSteady hardware campaign on Kickstarter in 2013.\n\n2. Supplies - Shipping a complicated fragile product to the entire world is not an easy task. Therefore we are not even trying to do it by ourselves - we have chosen experienced and renowned partners as the pledge manager and shipping/fulfillment center. They already made it multiple times successfully, so they will do it again with our game.\n\n3. Manpower failure - we are a small company, more a group of gamers and passionate enthusiasts, driven by a common vision. We have to always remember that we are only humans and our endurance is not infinite. Therefore, we solemnly swear not to overwork ourselves, not to overdose the coffee and to stay reasonably healthy.\n\n4. Over-creativity - we love our game and we want it to be perfect. Every day we have hundreds of new ideas about new features and enhancements. But we consider this offer binding to the point where we have chosen some of our team members to keep us on the tracks and not overcomplicate anything, but to deliver exactly the product that we promise.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Space Cadet", "descp": "Pledge $5 or more and be named in-game, and offering players status messages in-game.\nINCLUDES:\nBe named in-game!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2020"}], "stat": ["90 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 225 or more", "title": "Colonist - one way ticket", "descp": "Core Box with everything what is needed to play!\nINCLUDES:\nGame Box\nAll Unlocked Stretch Goals\nBe named in-game!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2020"}], "stat": ["1,350 backers", "Limited (2850 left of 4200)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 800 or more", "title": "Smuggler's load", "descp": "For retailers and organized gaming groups.

Our musician friends were especially vocal, and their feedback was tremendous, which ultimately led us to develop our mic stand clip. \nMagnetic Ball Joints\nThe system's magic is in it's aluminium rod featuring extremely high quality and high strength magnetic ball joints at either end, allowing the freedom to rotate the mount to almost any shape and any angle you desire, plus detach and reattach modules to customise the exact way you want.\nIndustrial Grade Suctions Cups\nExtremely high quality and versatile, our suction cups will not only hold up to hundreds of uses, but will also suction to many different surfaces such as glass, aluminium, and household walls!

we take pride in engineering the most innovative, stylish, durable and functional boardgame bags and accessories on the planet.\nSure you can get boardgame bags that are cheaper or re-purpose Swedish furniture store totes or drumbags but are they as comfortable, with as much padded protection, water-resistant, reinforced to hold 50 lbs, damn sexy looking and come with a Lifetime Guarantee? \nDidn't think so..       \n The GeekOn! Goal & Guarantee \nPLAY\n\nWe also sent out some samples to some of our previous backers that had youtube channels so we could get some early feedback. Check out their initial thoughts!\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nSure you can find game bags on the market for under $50 but in this case, as in most cases, you really get what you pay for! We believe that your expensive games deserve the most protected and comfortable bags and don't cut corners when it comes to quality as you'll see below. \nThe main objective of any game bag is to be able to carry a decent amount of games, card binders, figures, etc so we've designed our SPACEPAK with 47L of gaming space! That's enough space for 7 Chihuahua's or 48 cans of beer or ... well you get the point, it's a heck of a lot of space!  \n#toxictechno\nNeed room for additional smaller games, cards or your favorite hot sauce because game night is at Peter's house and his snacks are always so bland and boring? We've added two extra large capacity side zippered pockets to handle all of these with ease! \n#toxictechno\nNo need to walk around with bulging pockets when you have the SPACEPAK due to the conveniently located easy access top zippered pocket large enough to hold all your EDC (everyday carry) items such as your phone, keys, wallet etc. This means your phone will be within reach for a quick post-game tweet about how awesome you played and finally lived up to your Game Demon shoulder tattoo. \n\nMy Grandma always said that \"organization is key\" so we've included a set of mesh zippered pockets and pen loops inside the main flap. That ought to keep Grandma quiet for a bit. \n\nYou're game and card load can be worth hundreds of dollars in a single haul so we've added thick foam padding on all sides of the SPACEPAK to keep your game boxes from dents with extra material covering the zippers from the inside to protect your boxes from scratches! This also creates a safe environment for a wrestling match between your two cats just be careful when you unzip the front panel.\nInternal trim protects your game boxes from the zippers!\nOur bags are coated with a DWR (Durable Water resistant) coating enabling water to form droplets and bead off the fabric instead of soaking through to your games inside. This bag is the perfect gift to a friend who loses a lot, the tears they shed after your game will roll right off this waterproof casing. \n\nNothing helps carry around a heavy load of games like having wheels so rather than making a bag that is extremely heavy and expensive with included wheels, we've opted to include a sturdy luggage pass-through section enabling the SPACEPAK to function with any wheeled carrier which are readily available online ranging anywhere from $15+ depending on durability. Another great way to get your SPACEPAK rolling is to just wear it on your back and slide on a pair of rollerblades! - If you decide to try the latter recommendation at a game con please don't tell anyone we gave you the idea!\n\nMost game bags are just huge and a pain to store when not being used so we've designed the SPACEPAK to easily fold up very flat for easy storage or to easily pack in your suitcase to bring empty to a game con where you can pop it open and fill it will all your new game purchases (or the 800 pins you picked up at the Pin Bazaar!)\n\nArriving at game night with sweat stains around your shoulders isn't a pretty sight so we've got extra padding with a moisture-wicking mesh underlining to keep circulating the air keeping you comfy and dry to take on your game-playing opponents with confidence!\nWho needs a sternum strap you might ask? Well, there's a reason they're included in all camping and military backpacks and that's because they significantly reduce the strain on your neck and back by helping to keep your backpack secured at the highest point of your back instead of it dangling behind you and pulling you down with the added weight on every step. Have I ever told you my nickname in college was Sternum Strap? We'll save that story for another time...\n\nThe ShuttleTote is the perfect bag for those looking for a way to protect and easily carry many games but don't need to travel too far. It's also the ideal bag for those whose needs change from carrying a bunch of games to just a few including most of the above-average sized games.\n We designed the SHUTTLETOTE to have more flexibility in terms of sizing making it the perfect bag to use as a large tote with 59L of available space where the sides can roll down to morph into a duffel bag. (I'm not mentioning any names.. but Steve actually uses the SHUTTLETOTE as his daily lunchbox.)...or you can opt to use it for just a few games or as a way to comfortable carry one massive game like Gloomhaven or Kingdom Death Monster 1.5!\nWe've added a zippered accessory section with extra mesh zippered pockets including a dedicated key pocket with an included carabiner that easily attaches to your keys. \nOur bags are coated with a DWR (Durable Water resistant) coating enabling water to form droplets and bead off the fabric instead of soaking through to your games inside. I guess you could always get the same waterproof protection by carrying your games in a heavy duty garbage bag but it definitely won't look as cool. \nPLAY\n\nThe SHUTTLETOTE can easily fold up very flat for easy storage or to easily pack in your suitcase to bring empty to a game con where you can pop it open and fill it will all your new game purchases! The ability to fold flat also allows for you to hide it much easier so your significant other won't find it and get angry that you bought yet another bag for hauling your games around - if they happen to look behind the books on your bookshelf and find it, just remind them that these babies are built to last and come with a lifetime guarantee so it'll be the last one you'll ever need!\n The carrying handle has a snap wrap-around to keep your two handles together so the SHUTTLETOTE can be carried with your arm in the handles like a tote or carried by the handles like a duffel bag. \n\nSHIPPING: \nFor The regions listed below with icons (U.S., EU, Canada, Australia, China) we will have these rewards fulfilled by a local fulfillment hub in your region so you will not be charged additional customs/VAT!\nShipping will be charged through the Backerkit pledge manager after the campaign ends and we send out the surveys to collect your shipping information and order specifics.\nIn the case of the UK leaving the EU we\u2019ll try our best to find a UK fulfillment hub so that no additional customs/VAT charges will be added to your shipment. Since we will be sending quantities to each fulfillment hub based on the survey responses it is imperative that you complete your surveys on time so we send the correct amount. Failure to complete your survey by the Backerkit deadline may incur additional shipping charges and if the hub runs out of inventory we will ship your rewards from the U.S. and you will be responsible for the duties/VAT. \nShipping estimates are based on reward levels but if you add additional items to your pledge it does not mean that you will be charged for the shipping costs of each item added together because we can bundle the shipping of your entire order and the total will be significantly less than the sum of each item added separately! For example if you are in the U.S. and order a bundle ($13 shipping) and an added bag ($11 shipping alone) the total shipping cost wouldn\u2019t be $24 but would rather be apx $19 for your entire order!\nShipping estimates are based on reward levels but if you add additional items to your pledge it does not mean that you will be charged for the shipping costs of each item added together because we can bundle the shipping of your entire order and the total will be significantly less than the sum of each item added separately!

Will we deliver on time? Will our products even resemble what we're displaying on our campaign page?\n\nWe launched our first GeekOn! campaign last year and fulfilled over 5000 Kickstarter orders all over the world with most backers receiving their rewards on time or only slightly delayed by a couple of weeks!\n\nFor this campaign we will be using the same factory for our backpacks located in Vietnam with an exceptional history of top quality workmanship with painstaking attention to every last stitch!\n\nCustomer service and satisfaction is our top priority and our backers were very vocal about their positive experience with our campaign, fulfillment and final products. We've learned a ton from our first campaign from campaign structure all the way through choosing the best international fulfillment partners and feel like we're up to the challenge to live up to our currently stellar reputation. \n\nHere are only some of our favorite post campaign comments:\n\n\"Yea! Got my package today! It looks awesome. So glad I went with the purple. The accessories are fantastic. All in all an excellent kickstarter experience. Thank you so much. Hope everyones' holidays are happy.\" - Sean Overton-Shadowopal\n\n\"I got mine earlier this week, and I can easily fit all of my D&D stuff, including my battle maps and miniatures! And I barely feel the weight of all those books on my back! Congratulation for an absolutely amazing product!\" - Normand Chartier-Prevost\n\n \"Very well-made backpack! I was so excited to get this for the hubby so he has something to use to tote his games to different places. I love the straps, and he keeps the dice tray in his car with his dice for those spontaneous DnD games! :-D Thanks, guys! (((2thumbsup)))\" - Lori\n\n\"Just wanted to say, finally got my hands on my bag after it sat at my parents for a couple of months, and it\u2019s fantastic! It\u2019s making the trips to and from Uni a lot easier. Thanks!\" - MarbleLlama\n\n\"This thing is amazing. I play 4 or so D&D games (I DM them all) and can never be bothered to take only the books I need. As such I'm carrying around 10 books, dice, cards, battle mats, character sheets and even the odd board game all at once and this thing holds them with ease. Far more comfortable than the previous bag I used.\" - Dean Yearsley\n\n\"I recieve my backpack and only have good words to support team, thank you so much Kate for your attention.\nThe backpack is awesome. Great work.\" - Asociaci\u00f3n Jugadores Gaditanos Valhalla\n\n\"This backpack makes me smile whenever I see it. It's reserved for games in my house and that means I'll have a fun time (which is rare enough), which starts when I pack the backpack. Last time that was three days before the actual date ;-). It's the most geeky item I have in my house and I love it.\" - PHOENIX Interactive\n\n\"while I don't know how the bag works with actual games I'm currently using it on a trip from the US to London as my travel carry on bag and I must say it's amazing. very sturdy, superb organization and comfortable with way to much crap shoved in it. Best travel bag ever. Thanks guys!\" - Jonathan Luke\n\n\"Got my bag today. Absolutely amazing. Can't wait to bring it for my next game night!\" - Zayden\n\n\"My full package safely arrived yesterday in Belgium (All-In with with just about all add-on\u2019s, my two caribeners were there, but initially were easy to miss); I\u2019m absolutely delighted with everything - a set of products lovingly created by gamers for gamers.

Thanks for the great service dealing with shipping complications & I look forward to your next project!\" - Ryan Butcho\n\n\"Finally received my last add-on piece in the mail yesterday! Thanks Kate for helping out and fixing the mix up! Now that I have the drybag I tested it out and it's HUGE! It fits my chessex megamat, the huge 34ish X 38 inch one perfectly. This ultimate backpack is out of this world. I've also been using the dice tray for my more fragile DnD minis which holds them snug and tight so they don't bounce around. Which has saved me a lot of headache and glue. There's just so much versatility in this bag, was a great investment for not only board gaming and dungeon and dragons, but also video gaming seeing as this thing can fit a nintendo switch in it's basic case in the top compartment alone!\n\nIn short, I love this bag and I wish you guys had created it sooner so it could grace my life sooner!\" - Brandon\n\n\"Bag is here!! Fantastic! Quality is amazing. Love the quad bag addition, didn't realize how big this would be. Also love the dice tray.

Thank you geekon.\" - Jovanie Rodriguez\n\n\"Just wanted to drop a quick note and tell you the bag is awesome. Used it for the first time last night, it was perfect! Fit: Eclipse, Mage Knight, Clank! + expansion, Arena for the Gods, Bears vs. Babies, You've Got Crabs + crab claws, two drinks, much dice and room to spare*. Great bag!\" - Rusted Portal Games\n\n\"Got my backpack today and all the extras that were included or added. Everything is in great shape with no damage or major issues (the zippers are a little stiff when closing but that should loosen up a bit with use). Checked so see if my largest game boxes will fit and they do (though obviously not all at the same time). All in all, I am both impressed by the quality and pleased with my decision to back this product (13th of 16 projects backed, and 5th fully delivered). Looking forward to seeing what new items GeekOn! comes up with.\" - Gordon Williamson\n\n\"Just got my bag and it is glorious! I am looking forward to using it not just for taking my games around, but also it will be great for traveling because of its size and storage! Arrived at a perfect time because I am going to a get together tonight to play and am going to use it for an upcoming trip!\" - En Sabah Nur\n\n\"My backpack arrived in MA, US yesterday.

This is an awesome backpack.\" - Ansalon\n\n\"Geekon has done an AMAZING job, and this is the fastest KS I have ever been apart of. Half to one month behind is ridiculously awesome for KS. The average is like 3 to 6 months delayed, and 1 i had was 10 months delayed....\" - Michael W\n\n\"Hey guys! I just got my backpack today in Canada and tested it out tonight. I worked great! I almost fit all of my current board games into the backpack tonight and it felt completely secure walking around wearing it even though it would of been very difficult to do so before with my old one! I want to thank you very much for creating such an amazing product and I'm glad that I now have a great backpack that will be using for a long time for my future game nights. :D\" - Eric Valade\n\n\"I received my backpack yesterday, and it is glorious!

If you are new to the game, you can check it out on its Boardgamegeek page! \nEnglish preview by Man vs. Meeple:\nEnglish review by the Dice Tower, with Tom Vasel:\nFrench review by Vin d'jeu (here you can find the extensive written review):\n German written review by Spielkult and videoreview by Die Brettspieltester:\n Italian review by Il Meeple con la Camicia:\nDuring and after the original campaign, a lot of backers and gamers asked us to implement a 5-player mode - since the game already featured 5 different factions. We listened to them and, now, we are proud to introduce you to the brand new Barrage 5th Player Expansion!\nYou'll also discover that the backers from the original campaign will have a lot of great advantages and the possibility to purchase a wide selection of gameplay-improving add ons and goodies at a special price. Let's dive in!\nOUR MISSION\nMake your Barrage even greater!\nPledge now to enrich your game with a brand new 5th Player Expansion. It includes a completely new map, specifically designed for 5 players, and also usable as an alternative map for 4 players, to add more variety to your game.\nPLAY\n\nNew connections have been studied to create original production networks and to allow new placement strategies without altering the game flow.\nFor a 5-player game, there will be additional worker spaces in the new management board; therefore the scalability is still optimal and the competition is not too tight in the common actions.\nAlso, if you are an original backer of the first Barrage Campaign, you will get a full set of redesigned wheels and wooden drops to replace the ones you received in your box, the printed version of the Automa rulebook and 2 new Executive Officers!\nDo you want to try out the 5th Player Expansion?

We want you to let your creativity run wild! \nPROGRAMMING FEATURES\n PRE-SET COLOR MODES: The RGB Critter comes with 8 pre-set color modes (solid color options, fade, strobe, and combinations).\n 24 COLOR SLOTS: Each pre-set color mode can be customized with up to 24 unique colors.\n CHOOSE YOUR COLORS: You can choose from a palette of 33 unique color options (including black).\n SELECT YOUR SPEED: Once you have your colors chosen, you can select your speed (1%-100%). \n SAVE YOUR CUSTOM MODE: When your speed is locked-in, the mode is saved and will remain until you delete it or execute a factory reset. \nADDITIONAL FEATURES\n FAVORITE MODE LIST: If you really like the customized mode, you can also send it to your list of 20 favorite customized modes. \n CUSTOMIZED MEMORY SLOTS: There are 52 memory slots available for your customized modes.\n RESUMES SAME COLOR MODE: The Critter will always turn on within the last mode it was turned off- The mode will pause, then resume in the exact spot you turned it off in.\n BRIGHTNESS CONTROL: Choose from 10 different brightness levels.\n BATTERY LIFE INDICATOR: When the RGB Critter is turned off, you can check the battery level by holding the top button for 3 seconds. The RGB LED will display different colors to indicate remaining battery life.\nThe RGB Critter comes packed with 33 unique color choices.\nSOUND REACTIVITY\nFirst of it's kind, the RGB Critter features a sound reactivity system that allows you to adjust the sensitivity to match the sound intensity of your environment. \nSound Reactivity Feature can be turned on at any point, including on top of other features.\nMOVEMENT REACTIVE (accelerometer)\nWe went even further and added a movement sensor, making the Critter an extension of your body controlled by your movements. You will have the option to either change the brightness of the RGB LED depending on the speed of your movements, or to have the Critter show light when you move.\n\n3 BUTTON TECHNOLOGY\nTired of navigating old lighting tools and toys with only 1 button? Us too! The RGB Critter has 3 illuminated buttons for you to easily navigate all features and functions. \nLight Painters: There is also an option to turn the Critter on with the button lights off (phew!).\nLOCK BUTTONS\nHold the top and bottom buttons for 3 seconds to lock the RGB Critter when on or off.\nCONVENIENT RE-CHARGING\nThe built-in 18650 battery is micro-USB rechargeable. When plugged into a power source, the RGB Critter's battery will fully charge then switch to direct power for continuous use.\nLIGHT PAINTER'S DELIGHT\nThe RGB Critter's Momentary Function allows light painters to turn off the Critter by simply holding a button. When the button is released, the light turns on. When you hold the button (light off), the Critter will pause your current preset or customized mode  and resume the mode once you release the button (light on). You can use the Momentary Function at any point the Critter is on (solid colors, color modes, any other special feature).\nAn example of the slow fade color mode in a light painting.\nTo add to these amazing features, we\u2019ve designed a series of twist-on accessories that you can add to give the RGB Critter even more unique effects:\nPerfect for performance art, the Orbit BitWhip accessory is a 5.5-foot long fiber optic whip with incredible flow and durability. With a low profile and a light weight, the Orbit BitWhip will feel like an extension of your body. Each of the fibers is cut into layered lengths of up to 5.5 ft. with sparkling tips at each end.\nEnd glow fiber optics (tips glow)\n140 fibers\nFiber length varies - Max length 5.5 feet\nBuilt-in bearing for 360 degree rotation\n The layering of the fibers makes for a dazzling light display, and the built-in bearing allows the Orbit BitWhip to flow around your body as you dance.\n We recently caught up with one of the top Light Whippers, Firecat (@firecat_flow), at Quasar Festival. Check out the video below to see her performing with the RGB Critter and Orbit BitWhip accessory.\n Dave Lopes (@ropedartist) is an insanely talented Rope Dart Performance Artist. We put the RGB Critter and Orbit BitWhip accessory in his hands to see how he would interpret the product. The video below showcases some of his incredible performance moves.\nThe Fyber Kit is a fiber optic kit that is perfect for any DIY costume or creative project. It's made up of 360 end-glow fiber optic fibers that are all 6 feet long. You can cut the fibers to your desired length and they will have the same lighting effect where cut.\nPlug the Critter into a wall outlet for continuous use.\nEnd glow fibers (tips glow)\n360 fibers\nAll fibers 6 feet long\nCan be cut to desired length\n The Fyber Kit is similar to the Orbit BitWhip, but it has more fibers (360 vs 140), all of the fibers are 6 feet in length, and the fibers do not rotate.\nThe fiber optics are made of high-grade durable material, so they\u2019ll hold up to all kinds of wear and tear. If you\u2019re a costumer or prop-maker, you\u2019ll love the infinite possibilities of the Fyber Kit. \nThe Sol Saber 2.0 is an incredibly bright 24-inch long saber attachment that\u2019s perfect for both light painting and light saber battles. Lightweight and durable, the Sol Saber emits a smooth and evenly distributed light that will give you an epic look.\n24 inches long \nLight weight at 5 ounces\nSuper durable and designed for full contact\nContact us for any custom length\nThe Sol Saber is made of an impact resistant polycarbonate tube. They are designed for combat and can be hit hard. We have been making light sabers for over 6 years and have gotten wonderful feedback on the durability.\nWe are happy to customize your to needs- Custom length, or weighted end cap, let us know and we\u2019ll take care of it!\nThe Jupiter Rope is a 6-foot long side glow cable housed within a rotating bearing. By directing the light out of the sides of the fiber rather than just through the end, you\u2019ll get a rope that can be used for all sorts of purposes from bicycle lighting to light painting.\nSide glow cable\n6 feet long\nFlexible rubber protective coating\nBuilt-in bearing for 360 degree rotation\nCan be cut to desired length\n The Jupiter Rope is extremely durable, protected by a rubber sleeve resistant to scratching and water damage. It\u2019s also very flexible and can be used as a performance prop.\n\nThe Orb is an incredibly useful tool and prop for a variety of situations, including mood lighting and light painting.  Its made up of a diffused plastic ball that evenly emits light when attached to the RGB Critter.\n The Orb can be used to help you choose colors for your custom modes, as its diffused glow allows you to clearly view the differences between the color blends. \nDouble up any of these effects with the Critter Connector, an attachment that allows you to connect two Critters back-to-back. It screws easily into the back end of the RGB Critter, giving you the ability to mix and match multiple accessories.\n With the Critter Connector, you can turn your one Sol Saber attachment into a Sol Saber staff. You can even connect two Orbit BitWhips together for a dazzling light show that will be sure to blow away your audience. Any color combination you can imagine is possible with the Critter Connector.\nDouble Sided Sol Sabers and BitWhips are customer favorites, but feel free to mix-and-match any 2 accessories with Critters back-to-back!\n The video below demonstrates some of the ways you can use the RGB Critter on your bike. The Critter has an IP54 rating, meaning it is dust and water resistant and you can safely use it on the Playa or in the rain.\nReady to pre-order? Back this project and choose your reward.

See the FAQ section for more information.\n If you miss out on this on-off item, don't worry, you can create your own using the online instructions (see FAQ).\nWe will make sure you have your RGB Critter and accessories before festival season hits! \n The READY insignia is for teams that have taken steps to prepare for manufacturing and delivery. This insignia indicates the readiness of a creator to fulfill Kickstarter campaign commitments. These harder-to-obtain insignia are awarded prior to campaign launch, following a readiness assessment by the Connection team made up of experts from Avnet and Dragon Innovation. There are three levels of readiness indicated by the insignia, increasing from 1 to 3 as a project advances towards manufacturing.\n    What this means:  \nProduct is able to be manufactured at expected volumes and production plans are in place\n  Funding via Kickstarter is needed to purchase production tools and materials, and to certify the product\n  Product has undergone several design iterations based on feedback from user trials and demonstrates refined functionality\n  Master Toy Maker, Joel Pinkham, has hand-made thousands of color changing flashlights using copper pipe parts. Here are some examples of the first flashlights he made back in 2013.\nHand-made color changing flashlights made with copper pipe parts.\nHere's a closer look at how we chose the robotic octopus tentacle design for the Critter's permanent silicone sleeve.\nOriginal hand drawn octopus tentacle (left) design by Zach Pyne. Silicone sleeve design (right).\nFounded in 2012, we are Ants on a Melon, a Springfield, Oregon-based manufacturer of color changing flashlights and fiber optic accessories. We work with electronic music festival attendees and high-tech fashion designers looking to enhance user experience, visual appeal, and 3D artistic displays. \nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 850+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $370M raised between them.\nThe RGB Critter is as powerful as it is durable. We gave it a plastic clam shell and a 2-millimeter thick aluminum housing to protect the electronics from the elements. The Critter is anything but fragile, as its shock-absorbent silicone sleeve can handle the stress from all sorts of impacts.\nWeatherproof and impact-resistant, we built the RGB Critter to last a lifetime.  The RGB Critter is backed by our Limited Lifetime Warranty (see FAQ section for more information).\n Special Thanks From Our Master Toy Maker \nSpecial Thanks \nJennifer Creighton, Pdon Pinkham, Jesse Long, Adam Spencer, Natalie Walsh, Tyler Spades, Daniel Mascarenhas, Lance Ghostkeeper, Lauren Houston, Zach Pyne, Darius Dart, Matty Evans, Curtise Broberg, Dylan Grytness, and Jeremy RisingSun Johnson.\nMain Video Song | Producer: Mark System | Track: \"Waiting for a Meaningful Title\"\nBig Thanks to Funhouse Toronto (@thefunhousetoronto)\nPaul Jackson (@pauljacksonlives), The Broad Bent Sisters (@thebroadbentsisters), Christopher Dela (@christoph.dc), Justin Pape (@jpjustinpape),  Nicole Charles (@nicoledcharles), Ben Johnston (@benjohnstondesign), Casey Watson (@kiwi_up, (@raquelpalis),  (@kylaincreation), and (@mondoforma).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAnts on a Melon was established in 2012, and we have been manufacturing and selling color changing flashlights through our website world-wide ever since.

If you would like to possibly name a planet in This IS Rocket Science leave your suggestions in the comments of the campaign! Remember, nothing vulgar and if you want to make a reference go a little less direct! (Endand vs Endor for example)\nWelcome to the campaign! We have another set of three fun and engaging pocket-sized games for you, each with all the rules printed on a folding box to allow you to bring game night with you almost anywhere! All three games make up the third wave in our F.L.O.A.T. series. It is our goal to release card games that are Fun, Lively, Original, Approachable, and Tiny. These games could find a home on a lunch table or gaming table, at game night or at date night (maybe check with your partner first on that one).\nEach game contains 18 cards and a folding \"hook box\" that has the rules printed directly on the inside. The cards and boxes are made of 320 gsm black-core card stock (sturdier than stock for Magic: The Gathering) with a protective UV coating as well. Keep scrolling for info on each game, reviews, how to play videos and more. We hope you join us on this campaign and look forward to making these titles a reality!\nClick the image above to read the full rules!\n We start off with the Winner of The Game Crafters' Hook Box Game Challenge, Cards of Olympus! \nCards of Olympus is an 18 card deck builder/manipulator; that's right deck building in just 18 cards! Players take on the role of Gods looking to take the charge of the throne of Olympus by building a powerful alliance of Gods and Heroes. Cards are double sided and split top and bottom with each card featuring a Mortal, Hero, God, and Monster. All cards are shared, with players gaining resources and abilities from the half of the cards that faces them. Acquire Tribute and Drachma to use special powers, guide your mortals and heroes to godhood, or add new cards to the deck an insure you gaining an additional leg up on the competition. Any upgrade in your characters helps your future hands but negatively impacts your opponent's; keep a close eye on each others' moves to make sure you come out on top!\nWith amazing artwork by the immensely talented Beth Sobel, this game begs to be played anywhere you take it!\n\"...a clever way to make a small, deck builder card game. Hopefully you can check it out and get it to your table.\"- Brody Sheard, Meeple Mountain\nClick the image to view the Rules and Free B&W PnP\nIn A Wizard's Shelf, players seek to prove they are the most esteemed wizard in the land by filling their shelves with similar types of ingredients and completing spells. Players draft cards from center stacks in an attempt to build out their shelf tableau and unlock new scoring mechanics. Players can also use abilities from spells to change up the game and their collection of ingredients.\nWhen all the cards are drafted players tally up points based on their unlocked scoring and adjacent similar ingredients. Players also lose points if they match up items of the same color.\n\"All in all, I think this is another solid entry in the wallet [hook box] game line, and if you\u2019re looking for a title that will challenge you a bit spatially and you\u2019re into a bit of magic, you might want to check out A Wizard\u2019s Shelf! I\u2019ve had fun with it.\" - Eric Yurko, What's Eric Playing?\nClick the image to view the Rules and free B&W PnP!\nIn This IS Rocket Science, players look to become the most prolific space explorer by landing on or orbiting planets. All game cards serve a dual purpose, acting as both the planets for scoring and the rocket fuel used to reach the planets.\nOn a turn players will draft cards from a central tableau or combine cards from their hands to reach exact target rocket fuel numbers to either land on or orbit a planet in the tableau. To score a planet, a player will discard cards from their hand and multiply the rocket fuel values together to hit the aforementioned target number. Some cards can also be discarded in order to add or subtract from the fuel value.\n\"I thought this was cool. Its basically an 18-card SciFi Point Salad. You're trying to land on a planet (or orbit it) for varying scores & cards double as both rocket fuel and victory points.\" Glenn Flaherty, Boardgames and Bourbon (Via Twitter)\nA Note on Stretch Goals: In previous campaigns we've had a few promo cards that could be unlocked via stretch goals. This time around we wanted to backers to know exactly what they are getting when they back the game and be sure they are receiving the 100% intended experience of each pocket sized adventure. Anything added in or adjusted with the games will be done so organically and because it is for the betterment of the base game experience.\n Below are some quick overview GIFs of the gameplay for each game.

While there is no set \"friendly\" shipping for international orders, the games are small enough that no additional customs fees, etc. were encountered for the vast majority of international backers. Depending on your countries policies there is a possibility of some additional charges, though this is unlikely from our Wave 1&2 experience. Please keep in mind this was also based on ordering 3 or less copies and as the package gets heavier, the chances of a customs fee may possibly increase.

We aim for small boxes that have bigger fun inside so we can make sure you get a quality game without a lot of delays and headaches. We operate with a smaller, US based printer that uses standardized sizes of certain components to make sure we have a consistent quality and faster production times. Our first campaign ended in May of 2018 and fulfillment began August of that same year. Our second campaign ended April of 2019 and started fulfilling towards the end of June/beginning of July. We hope for a similar 3 to 4 month turnaround time, though, it may take longer given this printing will run into the holiday season. Our first two campaigns gave us some solid information on things like fulfillment to help with this next campaign.\n\nRisks and Delays are still possible. We could run into production or shipping hiccups that are unpredictable. We also may have a longer lead time with some of the promo cards we could possibly unlock. With these things in mind I have added just a small amount of time to our delivery dates with the hope of delivering sooner.

Points are earned by visiting different parts of the city, but the various ways of earning them are only unlocked by crossing the city\u2019s seven bridges. The player who tallies the most points at the end of five rounds wins!\nSEVEN BRIDGES stands out from other roll-and-write games because it includes a map of a real-world city created by a professional cartographer!\nBOX AND SHEET SIZE COMPARISON \nThe above graphic shows the size of the Seven Bridges box and sheets compared with other popular roll-and-write games.\nHOW TO PLAY\nDownload the rulebook (PDF)\nYou perform two kinds of drafting in Seven Bridges: dice drafting and map drafting. First you draft (choose) a die, then you draft (draw) its lines onto your map!\nVISITING LANDMARKS\nIn addition to the aforementioned seven bridges, there are eleven landmarks on the map. Whenever you identify a landmark \u2013 by drawing a line that passes in front of its letter \u2013 you get to select a bonus from either the IMMEDIATE USE or RESERVED USE column to the left of the map.\nSCORING\nThere are seven different ways to score points, one for each item in the map\u2019s legend.\n1) Street; footpath - If you drew any closed loops on your map, find the one that will score you the most points: multiply the number of corners (right angles) that it has by the number of bridges that it crosses.\n2) Bridge; river - For each bridge that you completely cross, fill in one segment in the bridges crossed scale bar and score the indicated value.\n3) Landmark - For each landmark that you visit, fill in one segment in the landmarks visited scale bar and score the indicated value.\n4) Building - Color in all the buildings that you saw, scoring one point for each.\n5) Trees - Color in all the trees that you passed in front of, and score one point for each.\n6) Grid squares - Look for all the places where you drew lines to the edge of the map, and sum the value of the coordinates written beside them.\n7) Drafting - Sum the value of all of the bonuses that you used in both the IMMEDIATE USE and RESERVED USE columns.\nTOTAL SCORE\nFor each of the seven bridges that you were able to cross, you earn the points from one of the seven items in the map legend. For example, if you crossed five bridges, you score the five highest values and ignore the two lowest.\nOur player was able to cross six of the seven bridges on the map. Excluding their lowest scoring legend item, their total score was a very respectable 208 points!\nSOLO MODE\nWith nine difficulty levels, the solo player version of SEVEN BRIDGES is an entertaining challenge that is often won or lost on the last turn! The rules are exactly the same as a two-player game, except now you will be competing against an AI opponent named Euler, and he will score points for all the parts of K\u00f6nigsberg that you don't visit!\nAt the end of five rounds, calculate your total score exactly as you would in a multiplayer game. Then calculate Euler\u2019s score:\n1) Street; footpath \u2013 Euler scores 0 points; he doesn\u2019t make any closed loops.\n2) Bridge; river \u2013 Euler crosses all the bridges that you did not. Determine his score using the bridges crossed scale bar: if he had to cross two of the seven bridges, he would score 4 points.\n3) Landmark \u2013 Euler visits all the landmarks that you did not. Determine his score using the landmarks visited scale bar: if he had to visit four of the eleven landmarks, he would score 10 points.\n4) Building \u2013 Euler passes by all the buildings that you did not. There are exactly 100 buildings on the map: if you passed by 55 buildings, Euler would score 45 points.\n5) Trees \u2013 Euler passes by all of the trees that you did not. There are exactly 100 trees on the map as well: if you only saw 30 trees, Euler would score 70 points.\n6) Grid squares \u2013 Euler visits all the edges of the map that you did not. There are 80 points available: if you scored 35, Euler would score 45.\n7) Drafting \u2013 Euler earns all the drafting bonuses that you did not. There are 40 points available: if you scored 20 points, Euler would also score 20 points.\nEuler\u2019s total score is the sum of items two through seven, regardless of how many bridges you crossed!\nIf our player had been competing against Euler in a solo game, they would have eked out a win by just two points, 208 to 206!\n SOLO GAME PLAY REVIEW\nWHAT'S INCLUDED\nA prototype spotted in the wild!

BesoVida does it all with food-grade silicone material. Prepare, cook and serve your food all in one container. Bowl in a bowl design offers minimal footprint, maximal capacity.\n\nBesoVida vs Everyday Kitchenware\nWe've picked some of the most used kitchenware in everyday household and put them head to head with BesoVida to see how they fare, and here's the result.\nUltimately, buying less stuff is saving more. That's why we created BesoVida, to help you take on several roles in the kitchen with just one set of utensil.\nLiving That Plastic Free Life\nMade entirely out of silicone and nothing else. Silicone is recyclable, once it reaches the end of its life cycle, silicone can simply be incinerated and converted into harmless ingredients like silica, carbon dioxide, and water vapor.\n\nHasta La Vista, Takeout Containers\nEvery year, more than 100 million tons of container and packaging waste are generated in the U.S alone.\nSaving planet Earth ain\u2019t gonna be easy, but bringing your own food container is. Together, let\u2019s minimize the use of plastic material and make Earth healthy again. \nThanks to the versatility of the silicone material, BesoVida can withstand the most critical conditions, we\u2019re talking -22\u00b0F (-30\u00b0C) to 392\u00b0F (200\u00b0C). So you can go ahead and heat it, freeze it, cook it and serve with it.\nOven Safe\nWithstand up to 392\u00b0F (200\u00b0C), BesoVida can really take a heat. But don\u2019t grill it though(or making direct contact with fire or heat source), it\u2019s not Adamantium.\nMicrowave Safe\nBesoVida contains no metal, hence it's entirely safe to use in the microwave. Simply remove the lid and you're all set. Making office snacks has never been easier.\nFreezer Safe\nBesoVida can survive under the most extreme temperature, -22\u00b0F (-30\u00b0C) to be exact. You can count on it to preserve your favorite dishes.\nDishwasher / Dryer Safe\nBesoVida is heat and impact resistant. Just throw 'em into the dishwasher / dryer after use, they'll come out just as new.\nFood Grade Silicone\nIt\u2019s free of BPA / BPS / Lead / PVC and other harmful chemicals, so rest assured that your food is gonna be alright with our container.\nClick here to see the material test reports.\nAcid / Alkaline Resistant \nOne of the perks of silicone is its low reaction to chemicals. Fill in whatever food you desire, BesoVida can shake it off with a swipe of a cloth.\nAntimicrobial Mixture\nForget to clean your bowl? Worry not, the silicone material is mixed with Japanese ionic silver particle to provide superior antimicrobial property, reducing 99.99% of bacterial growth.\nWatertight Leak Proof Lid\nOnce the lid is fully closed, shake it all you want, nothing\u2019s coming out. \nSteam Vent Hole\nWe made a tiny vent hole on the lid to allow hot air to escape, preventing food from softening and keep hot liquid from splashing.\nHeat Insulated Base\nWe've thickened the wall of the bowl to provide better heat insulation. You can pour in hot liquid without having to worry about getting scalded.\nNon-Stick Surface\nYour regular rubber / silicone containers are prone to sticking hair and tiny debris. With the antistatic treatment in the production process, cleaning can be spotless. Water droplets would roll like it's been repelled by the surface.\n\nPerfect Curvature\nNot just for aesthetic purposes, the bowl's ergonomic curvature fits in your palm like it\u2019s meant to be there. The rubbery texture offers a secure grip.\nEasy Scooping / Just Swipe To Clean\nNo escape for food residue, no corners are left out. The inward curvature makes it effortless to reach content anywhere in the bowl.\nBowl In A Bowl\nPurposely designed to fit into one another like a \u041c\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0451\u0448\u043a\u0430, Russian doll, BesoVida takes up minimal space while offering maximum capacity.\nMultiply The Fun\nFood tastes better when it's shared together. Invite friends over and enjoy the meal with BesoVida the container.\nThe Cutlery\nFor those who want to go an extra mile with silicone, we offer add-on silicone cutlery including a spoon and fork. The weighted tableware provides a balanced feel, the fat handle offers outstanding grip and comfort.\nMinimalist At Its Finest \nFrom its color scheme, design to functionality, everything about BesoVida screams minimalist. It\u2019s made to complement all styles of interior design, breaking the stereotypes of what a food container is supposed to look like. It's the perfect utensil for any scenario. \nColor Options\nAdd On Menu\nKnown for high consistency and accuracy with our production, we had been mass producing silicone / rubber based products for many prominent brands on the market since 1973. But few knew that we were actually from a small town in Tainan, Taiwan. With the creation of Besovida, we want to spread the words and show the world what we take pride in.\nAs silicone experts, we understand its stable and toxin free properties more than anyone does. Thus we started this journey to create a utensil that is perfect for everything kitchen.\nFrom sketching, prototyping, sampling to finalizing, it took us 18 months to make BesoVida possible. And with your help, we are more than confident that we can bring Besovida to the mass.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are positive that we can and will deliver BesoVida according to schedule, but there are always challenges and unforeseen obstacles that may arise, whether it\u2019s in production, delivery, packaging, etc.\nEven though this is our first Kickstarter, we are no rookies at product launches. During our 18 months of product development, we have refined the design countless times until it finally reached our expectation. We are the manufacturer and we are more than ready to get it rolling. If any issues were to happen, we\u2019ll always be here to assist you.

It slides open to provide three really useful functions:\nA stand, so you can keep an eye on your phone without picking it up.\nA secure and comfortable holder, which makes holding your phone easier and more secure.\nFeatures to enable easy mounting of your phone to accessories like desk chargers, car mounts etc.\nParticularly for people with arthritis or mobility problems with their hands, Ezl provides a perfect solution for comfortable holding your phone.\nIt uses no metals or magnets, so does not interfere with wireless charging. It is thin enough to allow wireless charging through both most cases AND the Ezl.\nWhat problems does it solve?\nAs a stand, it allows you to clearly see an incoming text, call or message WITHOUT interrupting your workflow, putting you in control of whether you interact or not.\nOn most phones, it also works in landscape mode, allowing you to watch a movie on your way home from work.\nEven better, it makes holding your phone more secure and comfortable. Now that so many of us check our phones whilst walking, Ezl adds safety to prevent your phone being knocked or snatched from your hand.  This video says it all!\nPLAY\n\nAnything else?\nYes. Ezl has features so that it can easily be clipped to companion accessories (available soon) such as desk chargers and car mounts.\nEzl also has moulded rubber feet so your phone won't slip around on your desk, both when lying flat and standing up.\nI'm also planning to put together a range of colours and designs to appeal to all tastes - I'd love to know what you'd like to see on your Ezl!\n\nYou may add more Ezls and Plinth tablet stands (myplinth.co.uk for info) to your pledge by adding \u00a36 per Ezl and \u00a311 per Plinth, plus \u00a31 for additional postage. You can list and explain exactly what you'd like when I send out the surveys at the end of the campaign.\nDesigned on an iPad Pro!\nI am really excited that Ezl is the first product I have designed from start to finish on my iPad Pro. Whilst I have been using apps like Procreate and Concepts for years to sketch and details designs, I have never had proper 3D CAD for engineering and detailing designs.\nNow there's a new kid on the block - called Shapr3D, and it has changed the game. For those of you interested in design, take a look on Youtube where you'll find some awesome videos showing what Shapr3D can do. It's a joy to work with.\nWhere will Ezl be made?\nI have chosen an extremely experienced and talented injection-mould toolmaker to build the tooling for Ezl. He will be doing the actual production too, ensuring that the entire process will be monitored and maintained under one roof.\nHis factory is based in a little unit hidden away in the Devon countryside, and which is completely powered by solar panels.\n\n\nThe Plinth Tablet stand\nIn 2014 I raised over \u00a332,000 on Kickstarter to help get my idea for a universal, stable, pocket tablet stand into manufacture. 5 years later, and Plinth is still selling strongly, both on Amazon and my website (myplinth.co.uk).\n In 2016 plinth was featured on the BBC programme Dragons\u2019 Den (called shark tank in the USA). The program has recently been released on the Dragons\u2019 Den YouTube channel, and I attach a link to it here. \nWhy crowdfunding?\nHaving lived with this design for over a year now, I am convinced that it genuinely makes life with our phones better - it\u2019s not a gimmick or a gadget, it is a well designed, durable accessory to perform a serious job.\nUnfortunately, I don\u2019t have the capital to afford either the manufacturing tools, or expensive agencies to promote and advertise Ezl (see my 1st update for more on this topic). I\u2019m therefore hoping to reach a crowd of people through kickstarter - if we all chip in a drop or two, we become an ocean.\nI don\u2019t have the resources or available time to commission marketing agencies.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAlthough Ezl is a very simple product, it is actually quite a complex injection moulding, and poses quite a few technical challenges from a moulding point of view.\n\nHowever, I have many years experience in product design, and am working with an absolute genius of a tool maker, so I'm confident that Ezl will, when finished, perform much better than the 3D printed prototypes I have been testing for months now.\n\nPerhaps my biggest challenge is financial - now that Kickstarter has become the domain of sophisticated marketing agencies, all of whom charge fees which I can't afford (which is why I'm here on kickstarter!).\n\nThis makes getting seen a real challenge.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nAll my designs are guaranteed for life.

But in this town, the villagers don't wait helplessly to be slaughtered by the werewolf. Each must deploy their unique abilities in order to fulfill their own hidden agenda! Whether torching the village, tracking the werewolf by night, or completing a fearful eldritch ritual, 5-16 players will lie, bluff, and kill to seize the night.\nDuring the day, you pretend to be ordinary. Trading goods as a merchant, studying ancient lore as a scholar, or taking confession as a priest. But when night falls, you drop the facade and work toward your own secret agenda. Perhaps you are an initiate of a sinister cult, working with your fellows to usher untold destruction. Or perhaps you prefer the arsonist's insane fantasy of torching half the village...\nPut plainly, Wolves of Mercia features:\nA refreshing reinterpretation of the social deduction genre\nA small footprint with a tight 30-45 minute run time\nUnique, asymmetric win conditions for every player\nNo player elimination!\n For those who would like to read the rules for themselves, click here (PDF).\nWe originally planned Wolves of Mercia as a small boutique release. A lean and lightweight project between major releases. But then we took the game to Gen Con.\nSituated in a game store just a block off the main Gen Con drag, we played dozens upon dozens of games of Wolves of Mercia with groups of five to sixteen eager players, and we felt something special brewing...\nThe game was infectious. So infectious that players wanted to run it back and immediately play another game. So infectious that players came back day after day to play again because they hadn't stopped thinking about it overnight. So infectious indeed that by the final day we had players from the first day running extra game tables for us!\nAfter a wild couple days at Gen Con, what was going to be a small release for us was suddenly getting retailer attention. With the realization that we have something special on our hands, we're turning to Kickstarter to expose our game to a larger audience and raise funds for a larger print run.\nWhat's great about this campaign is that Wolves of Mercia is in an advanced stage of development slated for a late October/early November release. We've prototyped, play tested, and have final assets in place for all components. There will be much less waiting than a typical Kickstarter. We'll need a few weeks for production, and a further few weeks for fulfillment, that's it!\nEach set of of Wolves of Mercia contains:\nA full deck of tarot-sized cards with hand-illustrated artwork\n17 character roles, 18 secret roles, 4 phantoms, and special character action cards including eldritch cultist rituals\nA hand-illustrated, small footprint gameboard with a premium light-diffusing linen finish\nHardy punchboard skill tokens and red wooden counters\nA robust, story-rich 35-page instruction manual\nAs a bonus to all Kickstarter backers, every copy of Wolves of Mercia will ship with a small thank you note that includes a code to download the exclusive Print & Play Character The Emissary.

In the game, they will be developing their own empire by managing resources, expanding their fleet, colonizing planets, and exploiting their enemies' position. \nThe game runs on a clever dice combo-ing mechanic; players roll for their actions and choose the order in which to take them. This can lead to big \"pay-off\" turns, especially when combo-ed with planet abilities!\nThroughout the game, players spend resources to upgrade their empires, re-roll unwanted dice, and even follow the actions of other players' dice! The follow mechanic keeps all players engaged throughout the game for virtually zero down time.\nPlayers will accumulate power (victory points) based on the level of their empire, as well as for successfully colonizing planets.

We are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way.

They always have wasted past in them at the end of there lifespand. This is why we create Zippi a toothpaste squeezer. \nIt allows you to quickly and easily squeeze out the remaining toothpaste from a nearly emptied tube. Combining a sleek design with unparalleled efficiency, Zippi will make a great addition to any bathroom and simplify every early morning routine.\nA Stunning design:\nZippi Squeezer was designed with simplicity in mind. \n\nColors:\nZippi will be available in a multitude of colors including Green, Blue, Red, and black.\nWe are proud to announce to you that Zippi is fully designed and manufactured in our shop, this enables us to have better quality control over our product line to ensure that the product we deliver to you will be top notch.\nAlso we have spent countless hours in our labs testing different types of materials and making sure that Zippi is durable, but most importantly we tested different materials to make Zippi Eco-Friendly, this means that our squeezer is fully biodegradable.\nWe have worked hard over the last few months with the manufacturing partners to make sure every element of the design is well understood before production will begin so that the production phase of Zippi will be fast and efficient. This will enable us to get Zippi to your door as soon as possible.\nWe believe in minimizing our impact on the environment. Our materials are sourced from a trusted supplier, and Zippi will be manufactured in our  shop . Even our packaging is made from recycled and recyclable cardboard that is provided from a reliable paper factory.\nAlso, the squeezer is not only limited to tooth past it can be used on other products like cream or pesto.\nDimensions:\nZippi was designed to fit around all the common toothpaste tubes. Over the course of its development, our team experimented by differing the size of the gap but concluded that 1.8  millimeters is the optimal space for Zippi to effortlessly push the remaining paste out of the tube. Couple this with its compact form factor and you'll never need to ask yourself if you should leave Zippi behind on those long hall trips.      \nThis is the Zippi family. You will be able to purchase Zippi in 4 different colors.\n\nHow it works:\nOur simplistic design is easy to understand and to use. You simply slip our squeezer on any old tube of toothpaste and gently slide up while Zippi  does  all the work for you.\n Shipping:     \nAs you may have read in our reward descriptions, the shipping for Zippi is completely free Worldwide, this will enable us to get Zippi to your door fast and free of charge.\n\n We're expecting deliveries to start towards early August but we're working very hard to speed up the process and ship your Zippi as soon as possible to your doorstep. \nPackaging:\nZippi will be shipping in a small, sleek and eco-friendly packaging. This box will protect zippi during the shipping phase but also provide you with a sleek way to protect your zippi when it is not in use.\n We need your support;\nThe zippi prototype is already completed, we just need your support, to help us fund the first production round that will start right after the Kickstarter campaign ends. \n\nThank you for supporting our project!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are aware that this is a Kickstarter project.

Click on a button below and spread some love for the planet.\nThe tips of LastSwab also have the resilience to be cleaned thoroughly, enabling long-term use.    \nLastSwab comes in several colors, so you can pick the one that fits you best. Standard LastSwab colors to the left and Make-up colors to the right:   \nThe different colors make it easy for you to organize your swabs in your home so they don\u2019t get mixed up!  \n1.5 billion cotton swabs are produced every single day and the average American uses 415 cotton swabs every year. In the UK damage is evident: For every 100 feet of beach there are 9 cotton swabs.  Let's make single-use cotton swabs a thing of the past! \n\n\nTo create LastSwab, we tested dozens of prototypes \u2013 we wanted to get it just right. \nBoth our two innovative designs feature a soft-feel tip made of medical silicone. It is delicate enough to be suitable for sensitive body parts, and so precise that it\u2019ll become a make-up essential. \n\n\nPaper, wood and hemp cotton swabs are bad too. The CO2 emissions from the production and transport of these single use cotton swabs can be avoided with LastSwab.\nEven the case for LastSwab is biodegradable, and the packaging it comes in is made of eco-friendly cardboard. The real game changer is that the swab is designed to last for thousands of uses \u2013 and we really hope the one you buy from us will be the LAST Swab.  \n\nLastSwab comes with a carry case so it's convenient to store and take with you on the go.\nWe have been through hundreds of iterations in order to find the right feel and look for LastSwab - and we're pretty sure we\u2019ve nailed it. \nThe Swab is made up of a stiff, compact nylon core with soft medical silicone on each end, and is both aesthetically pleasant and functional.\n\nChange your habits for the good of the planet in a fuss-free way. Buy LastSwab once, cross cotton swabs off your shopping list forever, and do your bit for the environment. Easy.    \nWe're a small team dedicated to creating sustainable alternatives to everyday products. About one and a half years ago we read that 550 billion cotton swabs are produced every year, many of which are polluting, spoiling and killing our oceans and beaches, this is why we created LastSwab.\nK\u00e5re Frandsen is trained as a cabinetmaker. He is our hands on, built-a-set-in-a-day, i-can-use-all-tools, cleaning expert, never negative, real prototype and photo expert designer.\nNicolas Aagaard has created industrial design for a number of years. He is our the-big-picture, this-can-be-scaled, rendering expert, excel and business shark designer.\nIsabel Aagaard has a background in designing medical equipment. She is our safety-and-quality-first, GIF fanatic, cafe brewing, scissor cutout, eco collaborative designer.   \nWe have wanted to launch this product for a long time, but we had to get it just right.

But The Really Useful CMYK Colour Chart is a low-cost alternative, giving you access to over 1000 vibrant colours you can use in your artwork - as well as something that looks great in your studio! \nEven if you\u2019re not a Designer, The Really Useful CMYK Colour Chart is a great way to add a thousand splashes of colour to your wall! And we ship anywhere in the world, with free shipping options available, making it a great gift for you, or someone you love.\nDesign by numbers\nWhen we first started designing the poster, we were choosing colours by eye. This was not only a long process, but once we\u2019d almost finished the poster - we decided we just weren\u2019t happy with it!\nWe knew we needed a different approach that would give us the 1025 beautiful and unique colour swatches we wanted, but that also displayed them in a uniform and attractive way. So we turned to Mathematics\u2026 \nWorking with a very clever Engineer we developed an Excel program that can accept any 4-colour value, in one of 9 points on a grid (as shown above), and the program will interpolate between those values in the correct way. Every number needed to be a whole, positive number between 0 and 100. The Excel program also needed to check for duplicates (ensuring every one of the one thousand colours was unique), and export the results in a number of formats. \nWhilst the Mathematics behind the program was a little over our head, we loved the results! Once we had a pattern we were happy with, we employed someone else to write a custom InDesign script that would import the spreadsheet of values output by the Excel program, and change the colour of the 1025 squares on the grid accordingly. Both elements were a HUGE time-saver, and proof that there is more than one way to solve a problem!\nFormats\nThe poster is available in a range of formats to suit different budgets and applications. We\u2019ve got you (and your wall) covered.\nDigital - Downloadable, printable PDF version of the poster. This will be sent out immediately after the campaign is over.\nFolded - A1 size poster. Printed on 170gsm gloss paper. Folded down to A4 for easy shipping - which is how we can offer FREE SHIPPING WORLDWIDE. Comes with a FREE Digital copy of the poster as soon as the campaign is over.\nRolled - A1 size poster. Printed on 250gsm gloss paper. Comes rolled in a cardboard tube. This means there are no creases in your poster, but it does cost extra to ship. Comes with a FREE Digital copy of the poster as soon as the campaign is over.\n\nFunding & Rewards\nFunding\nWe've developed the product, designed the brand, built the website and produced the video. Now, all we need is the money to fund our first print-run, so we can get The Really Useful CMYK Colour Chart off the ground and into the hands of those who want it.\nRewards\nWe are offering \u2018Digital\u2019, \u2018Folded\u2019 and \u2018Rolled\u2019 versions of the poster as rewards.\nDownload links to the Digital version of the poster will be sent out as soon as you have given us your email address (by filling in your Backer Survey).\nAssuming you fill in your Backer Survey in time, we will endeavour to ship your physical poster within 3 weeks of the campaign ending. \nConclusion\nThis poster was designed out of a genuine need for an alternative to expensive swatch books. We are really happy with the end product, and genuinely believe it will help many people produce better artwork, as well as brighten up their studio! We love that thought, we love this product and we love our business. We hope you do too.\nPackaging\nDepending on which version of the poster you buy, it will be shipped in different packaging.\nFolded - These A1 posters are folded down to A4 size (the same size as a sheet of office paper) and placed inside a mailing envelope. This means the overall package is very small and light, and therefore much cheaper to ship than the \u2018Rolled\u2019 version (which is how we can offer FREE SHIPPING WORLDWIDE).\nRolled - This version is the same size as the Folded version (A1), but it comes rolled rather than folded (meaning they arrive with you crease-free). They are shipped inside an A1-sized cardboard mailing-tube, which means they are more expensive to ship than the Folded version (which is why we charge extra for shipping).\nCarriers & Transit Times\nAll versions (apart from Folded posters shipping to the UK) are sent via tracked and signed services, meaning you'll receive a tracking number for your order once it has been dispatched, and you'll be required to sign for the package once it reaches you.\nUK\nFolded\nService: Royal Mail 1st Class\nAverage transit time: 1-2 working days\nRolled\nService: Royal Mail Special Delivery\nAverage transit time: 1-2 working days\nEurope\nFolded\nService: Royal Mail International Tracked & Signed\nAverage transit time: 7-10 working days\nRolled\nService: Royal Mail International Tracked & Signed\nAverage transit time: 7-10 working days\nUnited States & Canada\nFolded\nService: Royal Mail International Tracked & Signed\nAverage transit time: 7-10 working days\nRolled\nService: Royal Mail International Tracked & Signed\nAverage transit time: 7-10 working days\nRest of the World (ROW)\nFolded\nService: Royal Mail International Tracked & Signed\nAverage transit time: 10-12 working days\nRolled\nService: Royal Mail International Tracked & Signed\nAverage transit time: 10-12 working days\nShipping Cost\nUK\nFolded - FREE\nRolled - \u00a38\nEurope\nFolded - FREE\nRolled - \u00a311\nUnited States & Canada\nFolded - FREE\nRolled - \u00a315\nRest of the World (ROW)\nFolded - FREE\nRolled - \u00a315", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've developed the product, designed the brand, built the website and produced the video.

You'll reveal a unique and challenging landscape every single time the game is played which will require you to adjust your strategy as you go. Managing resources and battling the other explorers, it's a tense and explosive race to control the Shrines first!\nDon't see what you need? If you\u2019d like to purchase a copy of the KS Edition of the base game or the Thieves expansion only, head to playmonster.com where we have a few remaining copies from the second print run available while supplies last. These will ship immediately upon purchase.\nThe Island of El Dorado - Legend Edition includes every single upgrade that we could think of right from the start. We've pulled absolutely no punches and maxed out our components in every way possible, matching the quality of our previous campaigns from day one rather than using stretch goals to get back to where we\u2019ve already been. Still, we\u2019re always open to improvement and will consider every stretch goal idea you all post in the comments which doesn\u2019t shatter our timeline or budget. Honestly, this is the version of the game we'll be personally using and we want it to be flippin' awesome. Let\u2019s work together to make this thing absolutely insane.\n*Update*: We've heard some great ideas in the comment section already! Here is our list of backer-idea stretch goals! You can help improving the game by sharing this project with your family and friends! Click here to share on Facebook.\nThe Island of El Dorado is defined by the beautiful artwork which makes up its tiles, resources, and characters. Each gameplay element brings a new life and a new application to these 16th century masterpieces which were created by some of the most iconic and gifted painters in the history of visual art. Graciously opened to the public domain by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, we consider it an honor and a privilege to apply these works of indescribable beauty, mystery, and majesty to the narrative of The Island of El Dorado.\nThis is the ONLY time The Island of El Dorado Legend Edition will be available. While the base game, Thieves expansion, and a small box version of the Revenge expansion will be available in retail going forward, the only time you\u2019ll be able to secure a copy of the Legend Edition big box, game organizer trays, and the kickstarter exclusives from this and previous campaigns is RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW.\nWe want you on this journey with us. The feedback we received before, during, and after the first two campaigns from our families, friends, and backers is a huge part of what made the El Dorado universe what it is. We want to hear your ideas, see your islands, and know both the things you love and the areas you think we could improve. Now more than ever, we need your feedback to make the Legend Edition big box the coolest thing any of us have ever seen.\nEl Dorado Games started with three friends just trying to make a game we could play together at game night. With the success of the first and second Kickstarters and overwhelming positive reviews, our new goal is to bring all the fun and excitement we\u2019ve had to friend groups around the world. We\u2019re thankful for every single one of you and we\u2019re excited you\u2019re on this rollercoaster with us!\nWe initially created The Island of El Dorado to be a strategy game that we could play with our friends and family who don\u2019t like strategy games. It was designed to be a tool to bring new people into the hobby; to be the kind of game you could play against your grandma (and she could beat you!). As the game and the community surrounding El Dorado grew, however, we\u2019ve incorporated new rule sets and modes of play that allow you to tailor the gaming experience to the preferences of your group; everything from a casual dice-chucking story to an asymmetric brain-burning strategy showdown!\nCasual Mode - For casual gamers. Thoughtfully incorporated elements of luck keep things balanced to the very end and allow players who may fall behind from inexperienced decision making to catch up - and win!\nHardcore Mode - For strategy veterans. Every action takes thought and could have lasting consequences as elements of luck are significantly reduced or removed altogether. It\u2019s you against them.

Be observant to spot the best cards and be quick to hit them with your hand before your opponents.

QWARKS WANTED it's 15 minutes of fun to renew as much as you want.\nIn addition to the game QWARKS WANTED, you will find in the box a rule to play QWARKS WANTED JUNIOR which is a different game for children from 6 years old (but also for the older ones). To play it, you will only use Qwark cards and Score tokens.\nSimply deal each player the same number of Qwark cards face down, keep the Score tokens within range and the hunt can begin!\nAt the end of the game, the player with the highest score is the winner. It's easy to play, dynamic and fun for the children and their parents (who have no chance against these formidable junior hunters ^_^).\nCheck out the following video or download the game rules below to learn more about how the game is played: \nClic on the picture to download the rules of the game (English & French).\nClic on the picture to read the full review.\n\nCliquez sur l'image pour lire la revue compl\u00e8te.\nCliquez sur l'image pour lire la revue compl\u00e8te.\n\nQWARKS was my first game successfully funded on the Kickstarter platform in 2017. These funny little particles created by Henri Kerrmarec pleased me so much (and at the backers too) that I decided to thematize my second party game with the same wacky theme.\nThere are common points between the 2 games such as the format of the box and the cards. As well as, in both cases, the objective is to score the most points by flattening Qwarks (don't worry, they love it ^_^) but similarities end there. \nQWARKS WANTED is a totally independent game and really different from its big brother. It is not played in the same way because it requires a good sense of observation and less haste from you. Nevertheless, I can always guarantee you frenetic moments. Furthermore, QWARKS WANTED can be played in 2 totally different ways to satisfy both adult gamers and very young players from 6 years old.\n Welcome to the world of Qwarks if you are a new backer or welcome back to the world of Qwarks for my backers of the first campaign. :)\nQWARKS WANTED is more than just a speed game. It's also a game of concentration and memory that requires steel nerves not to act too fast.\nThis game definitively won't exist without your support because, as a one-person company, I can't publish it with just my personal funds. My first game, QWARKS, has been published thanks to the support of 457 awesome backers who trusted me. The game is a critical success and is sold in several French shops. \nFor this new game, I hope to do even better and succeed in establishing myself in as many French and International stores as possible. To achieve this, I count on your support because the more successful the campaign is, the more likely I will be able to establish myself as a serious publisher with the shops. \nIn return, I promise you an irreproachable quality of components (rigid box, poker cards with a linen finish,  3mm thick tokens) and at a reduced price (\u20ac13 / $15 instead of \u20ac15 / $17 MSRP). Furthermore, every backer will receive 2 new Kickstarter exclusive Qwarks cards and each new unlocked Qwark will be exclusive to this campaign too.\nYou may also have the opportunity to see your own Qwark integrated into the game with your full name or nickname on a card. The more stretch goals you unlock, the more new cards I will add in the box and the more chance you will have to see your creation into the game. Don't miss this opportunity and help me unlock all the stretch goals by supporting me and spreading the word.\nAll of this is my way of thanking you for your support, which I hope will allow me to finance this game and why not other games in the future. Once again, thank you very much. YOU are the best! :)\nHow about imagining and drawing your own Qwark and then seeing it in the game alongside all the other Qwarks? Like the idea?

Even worse, if you don\u2019t have a good grip on your items, they can ALL fall back into the sink \u2013 taking your sanity with them.\nThe Equilibric colander reduces the amount of water needed to wash your fruits and vegetables by 60% - all while removing twice as many contaminants! You will never have to worry about items in the sink again because this design saves you time and frustration.\nIts ergonomic design keeps the vegetables upright and safe as the water bowl drains the dirty water away, cleaning your foods and keeping your clean items safe from spillage.\n\nThe colander also serves as a great serving dish for you.  You don\u2019t have to worry about using more dishes than necessary just because you need something to put them in afterwards.  Drain the excess water from your vegetables - and serve your fruits or salads in the same dish.\nTrying to defrost something at room temperature turns into a huge problem for most cooks.  Water often winds up all over the counter creating an even bigger mess, and more work for you.\nWith typical colanders, lots of dirt and other contaminates can transfer to your clean serving dishes.  But with the Equilibric colander, its washing machine motion helps remove 90% of the dirt and bacteria from your foods \u2013 giving you a healthier, more nutrient rich meal!\nAs you can see, the Equilibric colander saves you time and energy.  It\u2019s also incredibly efficient, sanitary, and environmentally conscious.  Moreover it saves extra money on your water bill.\nEquilibric has a very well considered hole slots pattern that allows to drain the excess water fast and simple. Equilibric Bowl is made from a high quality polypropylene which is an unharmful material to dine from. Equilibric Bowl design has a special spin system which uses the force of gravity to speed up all kitchen tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\nStory. Team. Development. Future.\nMy name is Ann and I\u2019ve been working in design for eight years. I\u2019ve graduated twice and worked my way from the position of a common designer to art director. My husband Tim is an engineer and likes inventing. Together we\u2019ve come up with Equilibric.\nMe and Tim were born in the countryside, and despite growing up in an urban area, we always preferred home food over fast food l, which bears no benefit or proper nutrients, often being harmful. So we cook home a lot and try to ease doing so process as much as possible.\nFour years ago I had the idea to improve the typical colander design, after having bought all kinds of them in stores, inspired by design of various items and inventions, from spoons to airplanes. So I took a pencil and got to draw.\n\nThanks to Tim, my sketches and concepts came to life as working prototypes.\n\n\nThe most problematic part was talking to various China-based factories. We were sending the design and info over, but struggled with communication problems. But ultimately, we found a manufacturer and a manager that helped us on this stage after it had stretched on for a while.\nTwo years ago, Sabina joined us as a co-founder, responsible for communications and marketing. Without her, we wouldn\u2019t have been able to make it to Kickstarter and organize everything.\nWe\u2019re really grateful to Inpixel, the company that took care of the video material for us, delivering calmly great results despite my quite extensive list of requests.\nOur future plans is to introduce a brand new type of colander for enthusiasts and kitchen professionals. I promise, you haven\u2019t seen anything like it before, and we\u2019ll be showcasing it on Kickstarter right from the concept stage! We\u2019re also creating a USB-powered heating food container, which might possible have its own battery.\nOur global goal is to create a brand of smart kitchen gadgets and food containers (both with and without heating) for carrying your dishes.\nPlease help us bring our plans to life, and become part of Equilibric!\n\nTIMELINE\n\nApril 24, Project ends\nMay 8, Receiving funds from Kickstarter\nMay 9 - July 10, Mass production\nJuly 10-20, Quality control\nJuly 20-25, Shipping to the fulfilment and logistics centre\nJuly 26, Shipping out\nEnd of August, All backers receive their Equilibric\n\nSHIPPING INFORMATION \n\n+ SHIPPING ADDRESSES WILL BE COLLECTED VIA CROWDOX  \nhttps://crowdox.com\n\n+ LOGISTICS AND FULLFILMENT SERVICES WILL BE PROVIDED BY SFC \nhttps://www.sendfromchina.com\nSHIPPING RATES\n1 piece (Round or Square)\nUnited States - $5\nCanada - $5\nHong Kong - $5\nSingapore - $5\nChina - $5\nKorea - $5\nJapan - $8\nEurope - $8\nUnited Kingdom -$8\nAustralia - $12\nRussian Federation - $12\nRest of the world - $12\n2 piece (Round or Square)\nUnited States - $9\nCanada - $10\nHong Kong - $10\nSingapore - $10\nChina - $10\nKorea - $10\nJapan - $16\nEurope - $16\nUnited Kingdom -$16\nAustralia - $25\nRussian Federation - $25\nRest of the world - $25\n 6 piece (Round or Square)\nUnited States - $20\nCanada - $25\nHong Kong - $25\nSingapore - $25\nChina - $25\nKorea - $25\nJapan - $29\nEurope - $29\nUnited Kingdom -$29\nAustralia - $45\nRussian Federation - $45\nRest of the world - $45\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 650+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $300MM raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSomething can always go wrong especially when we are talking about worldwide shipping.

Activating an adventurer allows you to place search tokens on the board in the shape depicted on your adventurer card. When every square on a landscape card has been searched, the player who did the most claims the card, finding the lost adventurer and adding them to their party. Each adventurer you add to your party gives you points and a new search pattern that you can use.\nWhen searching, you also claim coins, which can be spent to use special actions or purchase artifacts with useful powers.

Using options like screen dimming, screen filter, night mode, and theater-mode apps are hard to read, difficult to use, and lead to embarrassing situations. (see the Science Behind REDtext at the bottom of this page)\n Our app removes all bright light from the phone's screen.  Some apps claim to be usable in low-lit public venues.  However, they all have elements of white brightness that come through the phone's screen. These apps are forgotten because they do not work.\n\n\n\n\n Printed Program Reading Light Detail  \n View plays, concerts, or other printed programs without disturbing others(see demo video below).\nAdjustable brightness\nAuto on when phone face down and auto off when phone face up.\nDiscrete pinpoint light for easy viewing.\nStop the white light given off from most other keyboard displays.

While we respect the cinematic experience and don't encourage this app to be used idly throughout a movie, sometimes you need to be able to check your messages.\nGetting up and walking out of the theater can be just as distracting as turning on your phone, so we've created something we believe will both give you more freedom and create a less distracting environment for other moviegoers.

First, the color red exhibits the least stress on your eyes of all colors in dark places. Second, dimming our screen to lower the white light or using filters makes the text harder to read resulting in the need to bring the screen closer to our eyes. In consequence, it has been shown to cause many people to report headaches or nausea.

As business owners for 20 years they have over 15 years of experience in software development and software team management.\nPLAY\n\nOur Story\nThis app idea originated when my wife and I (Ken) left our children with a babysitter to go on a well deserved date to our local movie theater. Before we left for the movies, we instructed our babysitter to text us if she needed anything.\nMy wife and I settled into our movie theater seats, the lights dimmed, and the movie started playing. Then my phone vibrated. I thought, \"The babysitter is trying to reach me.\" Then again, maybe it was some random notification that I really didn't care about. What do I do now? I felt trapped. Do I turn my phone on, annoy everyone with the bright lights and become the center of attention? Do I ignore my phone and wonder throughout the movie if something has happened with my children. Do I get creative by putting my phone under the seat and bend over to read it (still annoying and embarrassing)? Or, I could stand and leave the theater, still causing a disturbance while others are trying to watch the screen.\nThough it was difficult to read the notification, I opted to do the \"phone under the seat\" trick.\nIt turned out to be a sales notification, which I could care less about.\nI was so frustrated that I had to go through those feelings of not knowing and embarrassment.\nAs I sat there with these thoughts, I just knew there had to be an app for this....why wouldn't there be an app for this? I'm sure I wasn't the only one that has gone through this experience. After that moment I undertook the task to locate an app for this glaring scenario.\nI couldn't find one!\nThis is where the product idea started. I partnered with my brother, who knows software programming and light theory, and we started this journey of creating an app that would remove the stress of looking at your phone for important notifications while in a dark public venue.\nWe wanted to give people the freedom to communicate in dark venues without feeling trapped, anxious, or frustrated.\nTo stay connected when it matters.\nWe worked tirelessly and are very excited to be able to obtain a patent on this use of this new technology.\n\nScience Behind REDtext  \n Why do we use the color red?\nThere are two reasons we use the color red. First, the color red in dark places exhibits the least stress on your eyes of all colors. In the dark, the eye pupils dilate or expand, letting in as much light as possible to see. In turn, certain colors cause more eye strain than others. This is because all colors of light emit pulses of photon energy each at different frequencies. The high-frequency colors like blue and violet produce more eye stress to a dilated pupil (see Scientific Reports). These colors have the smallest close-knit wavelengths in the spectrum of visible light. The shorter wavelengths cause higher strain on the eye and is, therefore, more sensitive and disruptive to others.\nMoreover, there are some indications that prolonged reading in this environment can lead to future eye damage. Conversely, the color red has the lowest frequency in the spectrum of visible color. Namely, red has a longer more gentle wavelength with each pulse of energy and produces little to no eye stress. Consequently, red is not even seen or noticed by others seated around us.\nSecond, dimming our screen to lower the white light or using filters has been shown to cause many people to report headaches or nausea. This is because setting our phones this way reduces the level of contrast between the text we read and the background making the screen much harder to read. (See comparison diagram below) As a result, there is a need to move the phone closer to our eyes. This focusing on close objects in dark places causes higher stress on our eyes. There are internal eye muscles called the ciliary muscle which is located around the lens of your eye. These muscles need to contract to reshape the lens position so that the light coming in is redirected to a focal point at the back of the eye. The low contrast level of a dimmed or filtered screen causes increased and constant eyeball adjusting. (See Reading in the Dark Article ) As a result, this leads to much higher stress on these muscles.\n  Patent granted in 2017 ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're based in Gilbert, AZ, and we enjoy spending time with family and friends.

There is a twinkling lens found in the hole of the curtain rod!\n\nWhat is that near the window?\nOh, there is a camera lens here too.\n\n\n\nHello everyone! My name is David Lee, the leader of this team\nI'm a person who really loves traveling.\nTraveling to different countries every year, meeting new people and experiencing new cultures is one of the most precious parts of my life.\nBut no matter where you travel, no matter what accommodation you go to, one can experience paranoia because of this possible threat\u2026\nThat's the threat of spy cameras\n\nWith the universalization of global travel, traveling became very convenient, and with access to some available services, one has the option to stay in homes at relatively low prices instead of expensive hotels. \nBut we've heard a lot of news about spy cameras that are found there.\nThere will be nothing more devastating than having a video somewhere on the internet which forever exposes my personal life, leaving me forever scarred all because of a journey I left for my happiness. \nSo I made a teamed up with friends in the engineering and designer industry. \nI started brainstorming for solutions where one can quickly and easily get away from the threat of spy cameras. Meanwhile, we were hinted by a security expert with 26 years of experience on TV.\nWhile the service for spy camera detectives are available on the market, if you search for portable infrared detectors they use, most of the devices are worth 300 dollars or more. Having these detectives come for a visit is just as expensive and adding this on top of ones travel expenses is definitely not budget friendly and is time consuming. \nUsing a material called cellophane can be another solution but it is easily crumpled up, making it difficult to carry around. \nSo we decided to make something more efficient and reasonable, and after a lot of research and effort, we made the Redcard. \nWith this Redcard, anyone with a cellphone can easily detect the lens of the spy cameras. \n\n\n1. Let's make it strong!\nA regular cellophane is not suitable because it is hard to cut and easily crumpled.\nYou can bend around all you want with our Redcard.\n\nCellophane is thinner than paper and can be easily wrinkled up. This makes it inadequate for frequent and long term use. One can use the coating method by pasting cellophane to a see through card but cellophane will start to scratch up and moisture will weaken it, making it impossible for semi- permanent use. \nThen a designer who has knowledge of diverse range of materials found a wonderful one. \nAfter testing, Redcard proved that it does not easily wrinkle up or rip because of its thicker attribute. Thickness made it very easy to cut it into the form we originally planned and there was no difference in the performance of the lens detection.\n\n\n\n2. Let's make it portable!\nIt was very important that we made it easy to carry around anywhere. Size too small to cover lenses and flash was not compatible, and too large or too small to cover would reduce portability.\nAs a result, I thought that the most standardized size that I could carry around anywhere in my cell phone case, wallet, bag, etc. was 54mm x 86mm, the size of my credit card.\nWhen I cut it to the size of a card, the edges were very sharp, leaving my hands with bloody cuts. So we rounded up the edges and left them to a professional to make it safe. \n\n\n\n\n3. All in one\nIt's really uncomfortable to carry a manual with you on your trip; therefore we thought it was important to provide a clear explanation. Please scan the QR code located on the bottom corner  for a clear instructional video to avoid any confusion.\n\nHow does it work?\nPLAY\n\n1) Cover both the camera and the flash with a Redcard. \n2) Turn on the flash and keep it on while pressing the video mode. \n3) Move the camera from various angles on suspicious areas for spy cameras. \n4) If you have a small shiny object, it can be a spy camera. \n\n\n\n4. You can save the next victim\nAnd I thought again. it could be a way to protect me from illegal spy cameras, but how can I get one step closer to a world without illegal filming? \nIt has to be cheap first. \nIf its affordable, a lot of people can use Redcard and find more spy cameras. I thought this would reduce the number of illegal shooters, reduce the frequency of installation, and filming of spy cameras. So the world can be a little safer, right?\nWe need your help! I will do my best to make the Redcard affordable.\n\n\n'Principle of the Redcard'\nThis is similar to the principle of infrared detectors. LED light, which is illuminated using Redcard and cell phone flash, have a wavelength of 600-700nm. The superimposed curved surface of the lens reflects the light of this wavelength back and is displayed in white dots on the mobile phone screen.\n\n\n'Target amount and sponsorship plan'\nFunds from Redcard will also be used as a cost to make the site for prevention of illegal filming and support for victims so that the Redcard will not end up just as a card. It will be used to open programs and projects to prevent illegal filming so that Redcard can spread and change the world. And If this project is successful, our next project will be a web webcam cover for $1.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRedcard\u2019s precautions and weakness\n\n1. It is a simple lens detector, not an all-purpose camera detector\n\nIt\u2019s not an all-purpose spy camera detector but a simple one.\nWe believe that it's the easiest way to find a spy camera at a reasonable price.\nThe Redcard does not have the ability to track down frequencies like some expensive equipment and track where a spy camera is literally located. It's hard to find one with your naked eye, but if you use it the correct way, and flash it with the right angle, one will be able to find the spy camera. (Poke it with a pointed object, such as a hairpin or pen, to see what it is.\n\n2. Writing can be erased\n\nThe description and design on the Redcard can\u2019t be erased by hand, but can be easily erased by sharp objects or rough surfaces. This is because the material is smooth and does not have the ability to absorb ink on its own like paper. While the front can be coated to make it more wear-resistant, the coating will reduce transparency and reduce the performance of the product. We will continue our research to find out if there are better alternatives!\n\n3. Do not over bend or fold the card \n\nRedcards are also flexible and recover their original condition quickly, but if one over bend the card to a certain point, the Redcards will not be able to recover its bent sides. We wanted to make this clear just in case someone may be unaware.\n\n4.

Instead carry hot and cold liquids together in one with DUO! \nGet rid of the struggle of two bottles, take DUO with you anywhere, for all your favourite drinks combinations! \nTHE LID  \nNEAT & SIMPLE DESIGN\nThere are just 4 elements to the bottle (lid, straw and two bottles), making it easy to keep everything together. DUO not only ends the struggle of two bottles, but also has the ability to be split into two and used independently, if you so desire! \nBALANCE \nHaving the inner and outer bottle sharing the same centre of gravity ensures greater stability. It allows for one bottle to be empty while the other is full and not cause the bottle to topple over.  \nHIGHEST QUALITY MATERIALS\nRECYCLED PLASTIC (rPET) \nThe outer 1L bottle of DUO is made from rPET (recycled polyethylene terephthalate). This means we use recovered plastic (that would have otherwise reside in a landfill or worse, our oceans). We could have chosen to use virgin plastic, which is cheaper and far easier to source, but we believe we owe it to future generations to do everything within our means to preserve our planet. \nSTAINLESS STEEL\nThe inner 350ml stainless steel bottle is double wall vacuum insulated meaning there is no transfer of heat from the hot liquids to the liquid in the outer bottle. It will keep your hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold. Stainless steel is also reusable and can be easily recycled.  \nBPA FREE & LEAK PROOF\nFrom the lid to the straw and to the outer and inner bottles, DUO is 100% BPA free and of course, totally leak proof!\nONE BOTTLE TO RULE THEM ALL!\nWe carefully considered the best features of bottles available and aimed to improve on them, when we designed what we believe to be the best possible drinking experience. Thats why we came up with the rotating straw nozzle for quick hydration and raised neck design to safely sip hot drinks.\nWe\u2019re Sarah and Ed, and this is the story of how we came up with DUO. \nThe idea was born from our own frustrations. With the plastic epidemic having become increasingly evident, we made the decision to live more sustainably. The starting point for us was to cut out single-use plastics in the form of water bottles and coffee cups, replacing these with reusable bottles. However, doing this wasn\u2019t as easy as we first thought. Being big coffee drinkers, it was common for us to stop by the local cafe en-route to work for our morning coffee fix. This meant, to follow our sustainable living mission, we would need to start carrying a second bottle for our coffee, alongside the bottle we already had for water to keep us healthy and hydrated. We soon found that having two bottles was bulky and required a large amount of space in our bags; it was just inconvenient. \nWe needed an easy solution that would help us carry our coffee and water in a space saving, easy and convenient way. After hours of searching we found such an invention did not exist, so we decided to create our own! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSometimes unintended things happen which can cause delays and so in an effort to be totally open and honest, we have listed below what we believe to be the key risks in bringing your DUO to you within the timeline. \n\nProduct testing: \nBefore we create the final moulds to be used in DUO\u2019s production, we will carry out final prototype testing. While we have a prototype that we think rocks, we won\u2019t begin production until everything is perfect. \n\nManufacturing: \nOur manufacturer is ready and raring to go and in possession of all the information needed. We don't foresee any difficulties, but if moulds need re-constructing this could mean delays. However, we have allowed for such eventualities in our timeline, so without such delays, we should be able to get your DUO to you sooner than November!\n\nFulfilment: \nRest assured, we have a crack team in charge of getting your DUO to you, this being an experienced global logistics company who have a long relationship with our manufacturer. Parcels can go missing or get damaged in transit and if they do, we will send you a replacement. \n\nWe will be sure to update you with any such issues and of course keep you informed as to when you can expect to receive your DUO.

Cannon is just perfect for backyard movie nights, parties, travels and a variety of indoor and outdoor activities.\n ENJOY TRUE WIRELESS STEREO SOUNDS\n If you have two Cannon speakers, you can use the TWS function to pair them together to have one play the left channel and the other as the right channel for full stereo sound. The two speakers can be easily and quickly connected via Bluetooth by pressing the button on the side. What\u2019s more great about this stereo mode is that you can mount either speaker to any location you like, to fill the room much better with a more airy and open sound than any other comparable speaker.   \nCannon is small in size, but powerful in sound. Cannon features a full metal body, which can deliver a much louder and clearer sound. The sleek design makes it not just a powerful speaker, but also a decoration that can be brought anywhere.\n  It doesn\u2019t really matter what you\u2019re doing\u2014partying, hiking, camping, having dinner or hanging out. When a speaker this small sounds this amazing, you\u2019ll never want to leave it behind. You can easily take it along in your hand, pocket, or bag. Wherever you need music, Cannon is ready to keep pace with all of your adventures and delivers unparalleled sound for its lightweight.  \n Cannon features Bluetooth 5.0 for a stable and consistent connection up to 33 feet away and high quality music streaming. You will not experience any connection losses, interference or dips in sound quality within the Bluetooth range. \nYou will be truly impressed with the sound of Cannon, for it pumps out high quality, crystal clear, full-range sound with crisp highs, detailed midrange and punchy bass without even the slightest distortion when cranking up to maximum volume. The enhanced bass response stays where it should be without muddying into the midrange frequencies or overwhelming the other frequency ranges, and you can see the radiator vibrating like mini-subwoofer.  \n Cannon comes with a 500mAh rechargeable lithium battery that provides 6 hours of continuous music playtime on a single charge which is pretty incredible considering the small size of this speaker. You can play up to 120 songs before needing to recharge and the speaker recharges relatively quickly. Cannon has battery life long enough for you to take around outdoors, for travel, or to keep the party going throughout the night.  \n The outer body of Cannon is made of a whole piece of premium steel that forms an enclosure to produce a more genuine sound and deliver it to 360-degree range than the ones made of plastic or wood. The phenomenal audio performance makes Cannon suitable for setting up home theatre to provide cinematic sound. It is your go-to accessory for conjuring the magic out of music. \n Cannon comes with a high-definition built-in microphone which allows you to conveniently take hands-free calls on your mobile device from virtually anywhere without delay. By pressing the button on the side, you can easily pick up/hang up the incoming calls.  \n The LED lights that surround the outer rim of the speaker at the bottom are nice to look at and they flash in different ways depending on whether the speaker is charging, paired or playing music. Cannon is designed to literally rock a party especially at night with its beautiful lighting. \n The exterior metallic finish looks and sharp LED lights of Cannon are incredibly eye-catchy. The minimalist and rugged design is not only cool to look at, but also improves the durability of the speaker. \nCannon is compatible with virtually any Bluetooth enabled device including iPhone, Android smartphones, iPads, tablets and laptops. The speaker pairs with your music sources in a matter of seconds and automatically pairs with the last device when turned on.  \n\n\nPROTOTYPE TEST VIDEO\nPLAY\n\nDESIGNERS' DRAFT\n\n    White    Red      Black\n\nA Special Thanks To\nFeatured on BackerPlanet - IDEAL PLANET FOR CROWDFUNDING ENTHUSIASTS.\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 600+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $300MM raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are now testing the prototype, and will start the production right after the testing is done.

It easily pairs with up to three devices at once and increase your productivity.  \nDesigned for versatility, the K2 connects via Bluetooth or with a cable. It can connect with your phone, laptop or iPad. Connect wirelessly with up to three devices at once and switch between screens for efficient multitasking and increased productivity. You can also use our type-C cable to connect the keyboard to your devices. Switch between the operating systems with just a toggle slide on the K2.\nK2 is perfectly compatible with all operating systems (OS) from Mac/iOS to Android to Windows, and you can easily switch among different OS. \nClick the image to check high resolution K2 layout\nK2 is one of the few mechanical keyboards featuring Mac layout media keys. It allows you to use all the same media keys as a conventional macOS. Every K2 keyboard comes with 3 specific keycaps for Mac and Windows, respectively.\n\nSetting a best example of efficient space usage, K2 has a compact 84 key design by retaining all the essential functional keys like Page Up/Down, Home, End, and Screen capture (command+shift+4) which are important for your productivity. With N-key rollover (NKRO on wired mode only) you can register as many keys as you can press at once without missing out characters.\nWe had a strong desire to design a wireless mechanical keyboard that everyone would love to use for everyday work. The CNC processed streamline aluminum frame and the plastic frame perfectly represent minimalism and protection to K2. \nCurved profile keycaps create an unbeatable finger touch feeling and the 6-degree typing angle is the most comfortable hand typing experience. \nNo matter what you like -- linear, clicky or something in between -- we\u2019ve got you covered with three Gateron switch options (Blue, Brown, Red).

Taking inspiration from artists and thought leaders like Jiri Thyn, Ido Portal and Alan Watts, the brand stands for simplicity. All our garments are designed to create the perfect balance between function and form. Our popular t-shirts are created with Nanoflex, a bespoke performance fabric made to fit like your own skin, while being soft, stretchy and breathable. \nNow, we are proud to present our latest brainchild, the Nighthawk jacket. We have teamed up with expert suppliers from around the world to craft a new, functional bomber jacket for urban living. The features of this jacket have been carefully curated to streamline your everyday city experience without adding bulk. \nWe believe that simplicity has the power to enhance your performance: there\u2019s a reason that Einstein rotated five identical suits and Steve Jobs never deviated from his iconic black turtleneck and jeans. It has been proven again and again that the burden of decision-making wears you down. By minimising lower-order decision-making, energy is conserved for the things that really matter. \nThe Nighthawk jacket was created to streamline your focus by lifting the burden of tiny everyday stressors: deciding what to wear, the feeling of dread when you can\u2019t find your credit card, tangled headphone clumps. At ZELUS LONDON, we believe that simplicity is the ultimate form of sophistication. That\u2019s why we think that Apple\u2019s chief designer, Jonathan Ives, had it right when he said that \u2018design is at its best and its most empowering when it simply disappears.\u2019\nWe hope that Nighthawk appeals to you, the city dwellers that it was created for. Your support will allow us to continue to create streamlined, innovative and beautiful clothing, including a women\u2019s line and winter jacket. \n\n OUR TEAM \n\n FOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've been developing and manufacturing high quality mens clothing for the past 2 years, our suppliers have been our biggest supporters since we started this journey.

Empress Catherine the Great is taking a surprise  trip down the Dnieper River to survey her new kingdom. This will take  her directly past your old, unremarkable village. You don\u2019t have the  time or money to make your village impressive, but with a few pieces of timber and some strategically placed facades you could certainly make  your village seem impressive. \nIn POTEMKIN EMPIRE, up to five players attempt to impress Empress Catherine by convincing her that they have the most prosperous village in the land. You don\u2019t have much time or money, so you\u2019ll just have to set up empty building facades along the river to make your town look impressive.\nDraft and assign interior cards to decide which of your buildings are real or fake. Score points by exposing your opponents' fake buildings, or by passing off your fakes as real. Each building you can add to your town has a unique ability, so choose the buildings you construct carefully. Some will earn you points whether they\u2019re real or not, but beware of your enemies\u2019 spies!\nPotemkin Empire is a strategic city building, bluffing game for 3-5 players that plays in 45 minutes. For more information, we encourage you to view the videos directly below, or simply read our draft rulebook here.\nNote that anything marked with these symbols are: \nKickstarter Exclusive - An exclusive item for Kickstarter backers with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only.\n Potemkin Empire is the 48th project from the combined teams behind Indie Boards and Cards & Action Phase Games. With the successful execution of our first 47 projects, we have become experienced publishers with a reputation for great games (in design and production) that are delivered in a timely fashion. \n Potemkin Empire was a finalist at the Geekway Design Contest which had over 100 entrants from across the country.\n Potemkin Empire was designed by the talented Jonathan Woodard. This game has undergone extensive testing and development to ensure the best possible experience. We are confident that this game will be in your collection for years to come. \n Potemkin Empire is an interesting cross-section between empire building games and bluffing games. The empire you build is three-dimensional, which provides a beautiful table presence that is deeply tied into the historical theme behind the story of Gregori Potemkin. The best part about the bluffing element is that you are never put on the spot to lie about the authenticity of your buildings.\nLike other empire building games, there are several different strategies that can be employed. Since every type of building is always available no matter what cards you are dealt, every strategy is open to every player! The key to winning will be determining which strategy is best to pursue against your current opponents' strategies.\nAll of the art assets are complete and ready for immediate upload after the project funds. \nKickstarter is the world's largest funding platform for creative projects. Every month, tens of thousands of people pledge millions of dollars to creative projects in dozens of categories. \nA person who supports a project is called a \"backer.\" The process of giving money to this project is called a \"pledge.\" \nIn return for your pledge, we (the creators of the campaign) are able to offer \"rewards,\" depending on the amount you pledge. For example, if you pledge $24 to help back the project, we'll offer you a copy of the game along with any stretch goals we achieve as soon as it is manufactured. \nYou can become a backer in just three easy steps: \n Step 1: Read through the pledge levels and rewards we're offering in the right sidebar of this page. \n Step 2: Click the large, green \"BACK THIS PROJECT\" button to the right of the trailer video at the top of this page. \n Step 3: Enter your pledge amount, and complete the steps for filling in your information. This process takes just a few seconds! That's it! It's really that simple! Thank you for backing!\nOnce you've backed this project, we encourage you to share this page on social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, and share with your friends and family. Also, be sure to like Indie Boards and Cards on Facebook and follow us on Twitter for real-time updates about this project and more! \nWe are excited to offer retailer packages for Brick and Mortar stores. For more information, please email us at: retailers@indieboardsandcards.com.  \nEvery backer is important to us, regardless of location, but the reality is that shipping and sales taxes are very expensive and is a cost we all need to share. To offset this, while remaining fiscally responsible, we have included a discount on ALL shipping and taxes, but there is no free shipping. Shipping & Taxes charges will be added after Kickstarter ends, every backer will be responsible for paying these fees in the pledge manager after the campaign ends. Please see shipping & taxes chart below:  \nFor the US, Canada, UK and the EU we have included applicable taxes, your rewards will be sent Duty Free from within your region \u2013 there will not be any additional customs charge. Outside of the US, Canada, UK and the EU, we cannot guarantee customs friendly shipping in these areas. There may be additional duties and/or fees charged by your country's governmental agencies and/or shipping partners. Those fees are solely your responsibility, and we can neither cancel a pledge nor will we pay those fees. In case a package is returned or destroyed due to non-payment of such fees, your pledge will be considered fulfilled.   \n MAYOR: (Pledge $24 or more) One copy of the base game Potemkin Empire including all of the stretch goals. Shipping and taxes are not included in the price. For additional copies in the US and international, check our rates below.\nIt is important that everyone knows that we are using a pledge manager. That means you\u2019ll be able to manage your pledge amount for all the add-ons that you want after the project closes, along with during the campaign. We will post an update to notify backers when the pledge manager email is being sent out. At that time, you\u2019ll need to manage your pledge and enter your shipping address and complete your order. \nOur plan is to have Potemkin Empire available at Gen Con. While our current production schedule looks like Kickstarter rewards will ship out around the time of Gen Con, it may be the case that we have games at Gen Con before the Kickstarter backer copies are sent. It may also be the case that we are unable to get games to Gen Con in time. I wish we were able to absolutely guarantee results, but we simply know that we can't make such commitments when so many other parties are involved in the process.  \nIf you want Gen Con pickup \u2013 DO NOT PLEDGE FOR THIS PROJECT \nAll the stretch goals will be available in the games we bring to Gen Con \u2013 your support is very valuable to Indie Boards and Cards & Action Phase Games and we look forward to seeing you again this year with lots of great new games.

With a global enemy in play, players don't directly attack each other but instead force other players to play cards they might not want to, resulting in backing them into a corner. You'll need to steal, sabotage, skip and trick your opponent to get ahead!\nMisdirection was designed and developed for new-comers and veterans of the tabletop gaming scene that love a small-box theme. Play-tested by players of all ages; from as low as 7 to as old as 60, we've proudly developed a game that is quick to learn, full of laughs and a fun experience for all backgrounds. \nWe feel the game is ideal for travelling and as a gateway game, as well as a filler for games when you're waiting for other people to arrive to your game night or between games to break things up...\nKey Features:\nEasy to learn, teach and play.\nIndirect player-interaction creating a unique game.\nVarying unique global enemies, changing each game.\nBig game, small box.\n\nSmall Box:\nWe're proud of the small box game we've created - we feel there is so much replay value in such a small box, making it ideal for travel. With a tiny learning curve, it's an easy game to get people that aren't into tabletop games to have a play!\nActual box design may vary from picture - the size will not change.\n You can view the rules here! \nThe duration of a game of Misdirection is based on how many players there are, that corresponds to how many life points players get each;\n2 Players = 6 life points\n3-4 Players = 5 life points\n5-8 Players = 4 life points\nPlayers shuffle the enemy card deck, and randomly deal one face up in the middle of the table. This is the enemy for this round, read the enemy details carefully, each enemy plays differently and will force you to change your tactics!\nThe action card deck is shuffled and one card is placed in front of each player. The remaining cards are placed to the side of the enemy in play. \nOn each player's turn, they pick up a card, and chose one of their two cards in their hand to play. You cannot pass, all players must play one card - sometimes this will mean playing a card you don't want too.\nAs you play a card, you must read it out exactly as it's worded on the card and place it on the other side of the enemy in play, then you action it depending on what the card says.\nWhen a player is reduced to no life cubes, they're dead and can't participate in the game any longer. The last surviving player wins the game.\nMisdirection is filled with many different enemies all with different abilities. Each enemy will change the way you play your cards -- what you play against the Skeleton, might not be the same you play against the Brigand.\nAll enemies were brought to life by the amazingly talented Anthea Wright.\nSkeleton\nNot the smartest of enemies, but if you slip up, the Skeleton will certainly let you know with a swift whack with it's sword.\nSkeleton Wizard\nAn unnatural being well versed in dark magic, the Skeleton Wizard is known for attacking not just it's target, but anything it can.\nAssassin\nThe shadows move as the Assassin emerges into light. She's highly trained and deadly with her dagger. She will not hesitate to stab an unsuspecting enemy dealing incredible damage.\nBrigand\nA brute with only one goal, to make as much coin as possible. The brigand is a brute and can attack with great force, but you could use this to your advantage if you knew the language he spoke.\n\nEvil Mage\nNot your normal mage, this cunning spell-weaver uses her dark magic to turns the tables and adapt to any battle with great force. \nConjuror\nThis witch-doctor works with the foulest of ingredients to turn battles to their advantage with each attack.\n\nTroll\nTemperatures drop as this frost giant approaches. While not the strongest of attackers, he is slow and his attacks can be used to your advantage, if you know how.\nDragon\nFlesh, blood and fire; a creature of immense power, with an extremely dangerous attack. You're not the only one in danger when the Dragon strikes. Sometimes it could be a benefit to take a hit yourself. Or two.\nGoblin\nThis warmongering creature has little love for anything but it's own kind. Only tempted by bloodshed, he can't be bribed with shiny objects or be fooled by shifty tactics.\nThe Goblin is only available in the promo pack; free with all Kickstarter backers, purchasable at a later date.\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Games with Teeth on Facebook | Join Misdirection on Facebook!\nArtist: Anthea Wright's Website | Facebook\nWe're proud members of TGDA, an Australian based Tabletop Design community.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n* * * * * * THIS KICKSTARTER IS IN AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS * * * * * *\nPlease note: We've done our best with the conversion rates, but please keep in mind, it may fluctuate through the campaign.\n\nMisdirection as a game is complete and with artwork being majority completed, our main Risks and Challenges lie in adhering to our manufacturer's schedule and any shipping delays that may occur.

This is my fourth Kickstarter campaign, and we've now shipped to over 2,000 backers over the course of our last three campaigns. Thrive presents some additional manufacturing challenges due to the unique components. We're equipped to deliver unique components. Just look at our last project, Swordcrafters.\n\nI'm approaching product development and testing with rigor and will put product quality before timing if needed. My board game publisher and Kickstarter experiences, as well as my day job as a packaging engineer, will be my foundation to deliver a great product and campaign. My money-back guarantee displays my confidence in the game and any challenges that we face.\n\nI will communicate along the way. You'll know if anything unexpected happens and I will do my best to make it right. I am building a track record of delivering games on time meeting project deadlines and avoiding unexpected shipping delays. The gameplay is solid with little to no tweaks expected. The expansion is being rigorously developed which gives you an opportunity to help influence it. The artwork is paid for and final files are on track for completion before the end of the project.\n\nThanks so much for checking out our project. I would be humbled if you back me.

Combining card drafting and set collection, you\u2019ll create out of this world gadgets with hilarious modifications sure to keep everyone laughing.\nDuring 3 rounds, players draft cards to build or modify their gadgets. Completed gadgets earn reputation points as well as bonuses like extra reputation points or special abilities. \nAt the end of the third round, the player with the most reputation points wins.\n\nWords from the Creator\nJoin Justin & Mel \"In The Lab\" to see what they have to say about Area 1851: Express! \n*Final Effect Token design may change during the campaign, this is an approximation of what they will look like.\nBelow is a brief explanation of how to set up, and play a turn of Area 1851: Express. However, if you prefer a video tutorial, we have one of those after the gifs. If you are one of those types that prefer to learn by reading the rules, you're in luck because this is a link to the up-to-date rules.\n\nSetup\nPlace the Reputation and Effect tokens into separate piles where all players can reach them. Shuffle the 6 Thing cards and set them face down near the tokens. Now, shuffle all of the Scrap cards together and deal 7 to each player. Set the remaining Scrap cards face down into a draw pile near the Thing cards. You\u2019re now ready for the first turn!\n\nPlaying a turn\nDuring the turn, each player will be looking at a hand of cards and choose one of those cards to play. Once they have done so, they will place it face down in front of them and wait for all other players to do the same. After each player has \u201clocked in\u201d their selection, all players will reveal their cards simultaneously.\nThe card revealed can be used to start a new gadget, modify an existing gadget, put into a player\u2019s scrap heap or discarded to draw a Thing card.\nAfter all of the revealed cards have been fully played and resolved, players then pass their hand of cards around the table.\n\nDelivering Gadgets\nIf any of the Gadgets being worked on have been completed (all of their attachment points are full) those gadgets must now be delivered. \nWhen delivering, be sure to read aloud the crazy contraption you just made! (Look at this Lead Coated Pony with an Ill Temper that Flies Erratically!) \nTake an amount of Rep tokens equal to the total Rep value of all cards being delivered (Including any bonus Rep from effects on the cards being delivered.) Be sure to activate any extra effects from the icons on the gadget, such as getting scrap for free or effect tokens to be used on a later turn.\nAfter 3 rounds of 7 cards, the game will come to an end. Players add up all of their Rep that they have earned and get a few extra Rep from any tokens that they didn\u2019t end up using. The player with the highest total Reputation has proven just how amazing of a Tinkerer they are, and win!\n\nHow to Play Video\nStella and Tarrant from Meeple University walk you through the process of learning to play Area 1851: Express.\n\nNow that you know how to play, down load the Print and Play version of Area 1851: Express and try it out for yourself.\nDownload the Print and Play\nVideo Previews\n\n\n\n\nWritten Previews\nArea 1851: Express Kickstarter Preview \u2013 Crafting the Craziest Contraptions in the Old West - Josh from Australian Tabletop Gaming Network\n Area 1851: Express \u2013 Aliens Invade the American West! - Krista from The Geek Girl Project\n Area 1851: Express - Five24 Labs - Preview - Matthew from MeepleGamers\n Area 1851: Express Preview - Brad from Pawn's Perspective\n Area 1851: Express Preview - Michael of Expand Your Game\n Area 1851: Express - Mark of The MeepleGamer\n\nWe will be doing stretch goals a little different this time around. We will list out the complete list of goals from the start as well as how much we need to raise to be able to unlock them.\nYou will also notice that there are not as many goals either, this is because we don't want to needle you with a bunch of tiny goals, we want each goal to mean something.\nWe are doing this for a few reasons, first and foremost we like to be as transparent as we can with our campaigns, secondly we only want to include known things that won't delay the project.\nWe are doing shipping a little different this time around. We want our funding goal to accurately represent what we need to produce Area 1851 Express. Because of this, shipping will not be added on to your pledge amount in Kickstarter. This is because any shipping you would add to your pledge, would add on to the funds raised to help create the project, but that's not entirely accurate. You would have contributed a portion of that to the project, and another portion to the shipping of the rewards. This could lead to a situation where we \"Successfully Fund\" by meeting our goal, when in reality we only raised half as much as we need, because half of that money is allocated for shipping costs.\nWith that in mind we've calculated the cost to ship this game to backers around the world and we're subsidizing that to help keep your costs down. We will be locking down the expected shipping cost for you, the backer, depending on where in the world you happen to be receiving your rewards.\nHere is how much shipping you should expect to pay for in the pledge manager after the campaign:\nUSA - $5.00\nCanada, EU, Asia and Australia/NZ - $12-15 (No VAT in our \"Customs Friendly\" countries)\nEverywhere Else - $20-$22 (Potentially VAT as well)\nWe are working to have proper fulfillment centers around the world to deal with keeping the project a little more friendly in terms of shipping. As we get those deals worked out we will let everyone know, and pass the savings along.\nOur friends over at Thing 12 Games have a great idea going on their Dinos Not Assembled Kickstarter campaign so we want to use the same concept!\nWhat we are hearing retailers say: The two big themes were Kickstarter advantages beyond distribution, and not wanting to have funds locked up in a Kickstarter campaign for a long duration of time.\nSo with our 'Retail Pledge', we are hoping to address those issues for our retailer partners. A $50 deposit gets you into our 'better than distribution' program.\nYou'll be able to get the game at better than distribution prices through Five24 Labs as long as you want to carry the game in your store.  You'll also have priority ahead of distributor orders.\nOnce you've backed at this tier let's start a conversation to understand what makes the most sense for your store. You won't need to pay the invoice until we have the product ready to ship out to you.\nThe $50 pledge will be a credit on your total invoice and we will be vetting retailers by their GAMA status. \nPlease email kickstarter@five24labs.com during the campaign for pricing information.\nWe are a small but potent team with an awesome testing group. You will get to know us over the months as this campaign continues on, but here are some faces to go with the names:\nWe would also like to acknowledge and thank our Alpha Testing team. We have an amazing, excellent and dedicated group of players that tolerate our crazy ideas and endless iterations.\nThey are up to the task of attempting to break things, and giving real feedback as we develop projects. We can't possibly thank them enough for all the work they do for the wages of snacks and fun and mild torture (in the form of terrible game ideas.)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHaving now had two successful \"Mint\" game campaigns successfully funding, we have learned even more that I could have ever imagined. The number of things that can come up and lead to delays is staggering, and they are not always entirely foreseeable.\n\nFor example, the cardstock we had planned to use for the Mint Delivery campaign had become damaged, and the factory wouldn't have been able to get more in for several months, delaying the project close to 6 months with that one unforeseeable issue. We were able to dodge it by changing cardstock and letting everyone know what was going on.\n\nNavigating issues like this has taught us a lot about ourselves, the process and you our amazing backers.\n\nThat said, it's always possible for things to get off track, and as we are ever committed to being transparent in our campaigns, we won't hesitate to let you know what\u2019s going on, how we plan to deal with it or even ask for advice from you when the time comes.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read all of this, I\u2019ll see you in the comments section.\n\n-Justin\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Poketto\n8 created \u00b7 170 backed\nPoketto is a small game development and publishing company that is responsible for bringing you the Mint Series games.

Check your posture right now.\n\nDo you feel relaxed? How is your back? And your neck? Do you know how to seat correctly? Probably yes for the moment. But during long hours you start to feel the tension in neck and back. We have that covered. Infinity PAD is an ideal solution to sit in perfect posture effortlessly, easing back pain.\nWe tend to develop poor posture at an early age. These sitting habits stick with us and we fail to realize how much it affects us everyday.\nThe Infinity PAD presents a simple and effective solution to all our sitting problems:\n\nThe Infinity PAD is a seat enhancement that upgrades your existing chair into a posture corrector by introducing dynamic and ergonomic sitting positions. \nIt was created as a one-stop solution for all of the problems associated with sitting.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany professions require more than 8 hours of sitting per day. That means sitting for more than 100,000 hours in one lifetime. \nImagine how this can affect your body, especially if you\u2019re sitting incorrectly... \nIt is impossible for many of us to avoid sitting, which is why the Infinity PAD is the perfect solution.\nThe Infinity PAD also has long-term benefits. It introduces and instills proper sitting habits. When maintained over a sustained period, it will train your sitting muscles to work even when you aren't using the Infinity PAD.\n\n\nSimply placing the Infinity PAD on your existing chair introduces a balance point to your seat. This balance point naturally pulls your body into a position of proper posture. How? The body's natural reaction to the balance point is to sit with your head up, shoulders back, and chest out. \n\nIt tilts the pelvis forward, creating a healthy S-curve in your spine. \nIt also engages and trains key sitting muscles in your body, including your back, legs, and core.\nThe Infinity PAD is designed for use in a variety of everyday activities. \nYou can use it while you work, study, eat, read, watch TV, or meditate\u2014virtually anything that you usually do sitting down. You can even use the Infinity PAD on the floor for yoga or strength and balance exercises. \nThe Infinity PAD is designed for consistent and convenient use. The product can be paired with one designated chair, or it can be easily transferred between multiple areas in your home or workplace.\nIt really is as simple as placing the Infinity PAD on your existing seat and sitting on it. This makes it a versatile product for any office or household. However you choose, sustained use of the Infinity PAD will lead to improved sitting habits.\nThe InfinityPAD comes in one ready-to-use piece. There is no assembly required. \n\nThe InfinityPAD is a lightweight and resilient product that is designed to last. It is made to withstand the same weight as standard chairs. \nSince its height is not adjustable, it pairs best with chairs and/or desks with adjustable heights. It can also be adapted for use with floors and other surfaces.\nHi! My name is Alojz and I am the creator of the Infinity PAD. As a school teacher and adult educator, I've seen every possible variation of poor posture. Observing my students, I noticed that the more fatigue, stress, and pain they felt, the more likely they were to slouch or lean into worse postures.\nI've seen this cycle in my students and I even experienced this myself. \nI tried many other posture-correcting products on the market but what I found was either expensive or involved wearing tedious devices. \nI knew there was a simple and effective solution waiting to be discovered. After researching the market and a careful planning stage, I finally developed the Infinity PAD\u2014a posture-correcting product that was affordable, convenient, and comfortable.\nAfter 2 years of researching and consulting with professionals, I developed the Infinity PAD. \nIt is produced in a boutique workshop in Slovenia and crafted with locally sourced materials. \n\nNow I need your help to scale the production, and help others. \n\n\nWith your backing, I will be able to produce the Infinity PAD with a variety of textiles. This will allow customization of the fabric and color, adding a personal touch. You can choose whether your Infinity PAD blends in seamlessly or stands out and makes a statement.  \n\nThe Infinity PAD is made of just a few key materials.\nThese durable yet lightweight materials have been carefully selected with longevity in mind. Without any overly complicated parts, the chance of any component failure is minimized and, in the event of failure, easily repaired with our help.\n\n\n\nWith the help of your generous backing, I plan to roll out the Infinity PAD following the below schedule. This timeline will allow me to ensure that each InfinityPAD is perfect before we send it to you, our very first backers.\n\nhttp://www.humanics-es.com/ergonomics_movement.htm#ergonomicpostures\nhttp://journals.lww.com/spinejournal/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=2009&issue=03150&article=00021&type=abstract\nhttp://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00140139.2010.544765\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687099000307\nhttp://www.gaitposture.com/article/S0966-6362(99)00026-0/abstract\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10755663", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith the capital raised from this campaign, I plan to assemble the production line that will allow me to produce Infinity PADs per the outlined schedule and bring awareness of the new product to the market. \n\nChallenge will be making designer Infinity PADs which we are looking forward to and be the best as possible to please your expectations.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Alojz Blazic\n2 created \u00b7 15 backed\nWorking on projects makes the horizon bigger.

Both companies have great records of working with Kickstarter campaigns and we have been in close communication with the companies pre-launch.\nShipping\nShipping will not be charged during the campaign. It will be charged through the pledge manager after the campaign based on the actual costs incurred to ship. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will be working with various experienced fulfillment centers. We are offering tax-friendly options for US, EU, Canada, Australia and Mexico.\nThe shipping rates below are an estimate but they will be the maximum possible value charged to the pledge manager at the end of the campaign. We have slightly overestimated some of the rates so as to give ourselves some leeway to work with unforeseen circumstances. \nDelivery is expected to be in October 2019.\nPledge Manager\nWe will be working togther with CrowdOx. For those who are new to Kickstarter, a pledge manager will help us to manage the orders and information more effectively.

This includes injection molding for the box, manufacturing costs for the cards, rulebook and tokens, and shipping.\n\nWe have done our best to accurately gauge our costs by building relationships with our future manufacturers and suppliers. \n\nWhile printing, shipping, and processing delays are always a possibility, we have set a reasonable delivery date based on our experience.\n\nFun Guaranteed! \nWe want you to love your experience with Lord of the Chords. If you don't enjoy the game after you've received and played it, just send it back to our headquarters and we'll issue you a full refund, no questions asked.\n\nRefunds \u2013 Kickstarter \nIf you'd like a refund before your item ships, you have until one week before the scheduled ship date to request one. We can offer you a 90% refund since Kickstarter retains about 10% of your pledge for various fees. If there is something wrong with your item, we appreciate the opportunity to replace or exchange it. If a refund is preferred and there is no defect with the product, you'll be responsible for shipping it back to us. Upon receipt of the returned item, we'll issue you a 90% refund. Refund requests must be made within 30 days of the date the item was delivered to you.\n\nReplacements \nWe are always happy to replace defective or damaged tokens, cards, or other components. Just send us photos of the damage, and we will ship a replacement at no additional cost to you. If your item needs to be returned, we will cover the cost of the return shipping. We provide replacement pieces while titles are active in our catalog, which is typically at least a year after their initial printing. Replacement requests must be made within 30 days of the date the item was delivered to you.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge S$ 2 or more", "title": "Support the Lord of the Chords!", "descp": "As a show of ultimate gratitude for your generosity, the Lord of the Chords blesses all your future practice sessions, exams, auditions, recitals and performances!\n(Also keeps you updated on our progress)\nINCLUDES:\nThe Lord of the Chords blesses you", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["70 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge S$ 55 or more", "title": "Minor Edition!

We're No Pun Included, professional board game reviewers, and thanks to you we've been making board game reviews for five years. We need your help to make our sixth year a reality.  At NPI we put you first, working hard at helping you decide whether a board game is right for you and showcasing some of the best that board games have to offer.\nBut don't take us for our word - just watch one of our videos to see for yourself. \nWe're incredibly proud of everything we've managed to achieve so far, but making informative, entertaining reviews takes a lot of time and effort. Whilst board games are constantly on the rise, it is still a niche hobby. Long ago we made the choice to be independent from board game publishers which means we rely on you to keep us going. Your kind contributions will help us produce:\nMore Board Game Reviews\nBoard Game Play-throughs (with our very first launching in just a few days!)\nSide-projects such as the What Board Game is this Song About show\nThis year we've chosen not to offer board game promos as rewards because they feel impersonal. Instead, we wanted to create some truly special rewards that we hope you'll appreciate. \n Newsletter: Backers at all levels that include rewards will be eligible to receive our excellent newsletter packed with sneak peaks at our upcoming reviews, board game musings and our general goings on.  \n Gloomhaven Adventure: Gloomhaven fans rejoice! Not only will backers at \u00a315 and above receive a brand new digital Gloomhaven adventure designed by us and the game's creator Isaac Childres, but folks who missed out on last year's adventure will gain immediate access to it after they pledge to our Kickstarter at any level (you'll find it in the updates section). \nElaine's Album of Comedy Board Game Songs: By far the most requested feature for our Kickstarter campaign is that we release an album with Elaine's wonderful songs about board games. So we're going to do just that. Expect a lovingly, not-at-all professionally produced, very digitally delivered set of songs that will be available exclusively only to backers of this campaign. \nIf you want to hear some of Elaine's songs, you could do much worse than watching our panel show that we filmed at UKGE 2018. \nBehind the Scenes Vlogs: Ever wanted to know what it's like to film NPI videos? This year you can. Through the course of the next season we'll make four videos letting you take a peek at how we do what we do. You're helping us make this journey a reality so we want you to come along. \n Your Name on Our Wall: Let's be frank - you're making us happen and we want to credit you. So you know those fast scrawls with people's names at the end of a video? Right, OK.  We're not doing that. We want something more personal and more meaningful. So we commissioned the wonderful Rachel and Heinze from Semi Co-Op to create a piece of art comprised entirely of your names (or whatever you choose to go by - within reason). It might be our logo or something else that represents us but we'll leave the specifics up to them. Then, we'll get a large print and hang it on our wall to be featured in all our reviews. Finally, we'll get lovely A5 prints mailed to you as a nice memento. \n A Bad Joke: What if No Pun Included made a video just for you? I mean, really. Just for you. You'd be the only person to see this video and maybe there's a good reason for that. Maybe this video is not meant to be seen. And you'll be the guardian of its secret. Note: lack of quality and length guaranteed. \n Play Games with Us: If you ever wanted to play a game with us whilst simultaneously putting a big donation into our campaign - this is your chance. There's two reward levels that let you do that. You can either play a game with us this year at UK Games Expo in Birmingham, UK in June (which naturally would require for you to already be at UK Games Expo) or, if you're feeling particularly generous, you can spend the entire day playing games at our house (although it would require for you to figure out travel and accommodation to United Kingdom). \nA Bag of Junk #2: Last, but definitely not least is the world renowned bag of junk, version 2.0. Yes, to you, our true fan, we will send a bag loaded with useless tat that just happened to have been used as props in our videos. Upon reception last year's proud owner described their prized possession as \" why did I do this?\" Words of praise indeed. And this year the bag is bigger and better. \nThis year we only have three goals. If we reach our funding, NPI can continue as it was for another year. However, if we reach \u00a335,000 - Elaine can take a step back from her full-time job to only work part time and spend more time on No Pun Included. This means more Elaine in videos, more songs, more zany skits - more everything that makes us good. Finally, if we can reach \u00a350,000 - that's both of us working on No Pun Included full time - essentially the dream scenario. Let's make it happen!

Of course, our work entirely relies on just us two and it specifically relies on us being healthy and well. We take care to look after ourselves and make sure we're mentally and physically fit.

The worst destruction has devastated the San Francisco Bay area. It is a time of rebuilding to restore this area to its former glory.  \nIn Aftershock: San Francisco and Venice, players will spend money to acquire planning cards, which are used to increase population, build bridges, and determine where aftershocks occur. Spend money wisely to acquire aftershocks that will allow you to move people into and out of the demolished areas. Planning and careful negotiation are essential in order to maintain your population and score your best-planned cities and bridges. \nAftershock: San Francisco and Venice is an area control and resource management game for 2-5 players that plays in 60 minutes. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins!\nIf you aren\u2019t familiar with Aftershock: San Francisco and Venice, you can check out the BGG page for more details.\nFor more information, we encourage you to view our How-To-Play video directly below, or simply read our draft rulebook here.  \nPlay now on Tabletop Simulator thanks to Overboard Games!\nEvery pledge of the Aftershock: San Francisco and Venice pledge level will include everything here! \nEvery pledge of the Aftershock: San Francisco and Venice pledge level will include the District 6 expansion - six player support and area tokens for increased replayability!\nAftershock: District 6 Overview:\nDistrict 6 brings all the swinging and swaying strategy of Aftershock: San Francisco and Venice to six players (an extra player screen, player board, 25 meeples, 16 bridges, 5 houses, player tokens, etc) and introduces 21 area tokens, a brand new board mechanic. \nExplanation of Area Tokens:\nArea tokens are effects placed randomly on different city sections at the beginning of the game.  During play Area Tokens present challenges or rewards to the meeples placed within that region - creating a different game play for that region during this game. \nArea tokens create a totally new, unique play experience for each replay.\n AFTERSHOCK: (Pledge $45 or more) One copy of Aftershock: San Francisco and Venice and with all of the stretch goals and the sixth player expansion. Shipping pledge rates based on location. For additional copies in the US and international, check our rates below.  \nWe are excited to offer retailer packages for Brick and Mortar stores. For more information, please email us at: retailers@indieboardsandcards.com.\nIt is important that everyone knows that we are using a pledge manager. That means you\u2019ll be able to manage your pledge amount for all the add-ons that you want after the project closes, along with during the campaign. We will post an update to notify backers when the pledge manager email is being sent out. At that time, you\u2019ll need to manage your pledge and enter your shipping address and complete your order.\n Aftershock: San Francisco and Venice is the 47th project from the combined teams behind Stronghold Games, Indie Boards and Cards, & Action Phase Games. With the successful execution of our first 46 projects, we have become experienced publishers with a reputation for great games that are delivered in a timely fashion. \n Aftershock: San Francisco and Venice  was designed by the talented Bobby West and Alan R. Moon, the designer of Ticket to Ride. This game has been tested in-house, ensuring that every part of the game is of the best possible quality. We are confident that this game will be in your collection for years to come. \n District 6 expansion is included with every pledge, a $20 retail value which will be sold in stores.\nAll of the art assets are complete and ready for immediate upload after the project funds.   \nKickstarter is the world's largest funding platform for creative projects. Every month, tens of thousands of people pledge millions of dollars to creative projects in dozens of categories. \nA person who supports a project is called a \"backer.\" The process of giving money to this project is called a \"pledge.\" \nIn return for your pledge, we (the creators of the campaign) are able to offer \"rewards,\" depending on the amount you pledge. For example, if you pledge $45 to help back the project, we'll offer you a copy of the game along with any stretch goals we achieve as soon as it is manufactured. \nYou can become a backer in just three easy steps: \n Step 1: Read through the pledge levels and rewards we are offering in the right sidebar of this page.\n Step 2: Click the large, green \"BACK THIS PROJECT\" button to the right of the trailer video at the top of this page. \n Step 3: Enter your pledge amount, and complete the steps for filling in your information. This process takes just a few seconds! That's it! It's really that simple! Thank you for backing! \nOnce you've backed this project, we encourage you to share this page on social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, and share with your friends and family. Also, be sure to like Stronghold Games on Facebook and follow us on Twitter for real-time updates about this project and more!  \nRetailers: Please direct message us for more information. \nEvery backer is important to us, regardless of location, but the reality is that shipping and sales taxes are very expensive and is a cost we all need to share. To offset this, while remaining fiscally responsible, we have included a discount on ALL shipping and taxes, but there is no free shipping. Shipping & Taxes charges will be added after Kickstarter ends, every backer will be responsible for paying these fees in the pledge manager after the campaign ends. Please see shipping & taxes chart below:   \nFor the US, Canada, UK and the EU we have included applicable taxes, your rewards will be sent Duty Free from within your region \u2013 there will not be any additional customs charge. Outside of the US, Canada, UK and the EU, we cannot guarantee customs friendly shipping in these areas. There may be additional duties and/or fees charged by your country's governmental agencies and/or shipping partners. Those fees are solely your responsibility, and we can neither cancel a pledge nor will we pay those fees. In case a package is returned or destroyed due to non-payment of such fees, your pledge will be considered fulfilled. \nOur plan is to have a limited number of Aftershock: San Francisco and Venice available at Essen with all the stretch goals from this project. We will not be taking reservations as in years past, everything will be first come, first served at Essen. If you would like to get the rewards from this project, we suggest you back through kickstarter! \nWhile our current production schedule looks like Kickstarter rewards will ship out well before Essen, it may be the case that we have games at Essen before the Kickstarter backer copies are sent. It may also be the case that we are unable to get games to Essen in time. I wish we were able to absolutely guarantee results, but we simply know that we can't make such commitments when so many other parties are involved in the process.  \nIf you still want to try Essen pickup \u2013 DO NOT PLEDGE FOR THIS PROJECT ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the 47th Kickstarter project from the combined teams behind Stronghold Games, Indie Boards and Cards & Action Phase Games.

Our previous experiences will enable us to also deliver this project on time and we have every confidence that Aftershock: San Francisco and Venice will be on schedule and of the highest possible quality.\n\nThat said, there are always complexities and considerations in a project of this scope that may cause delays. Stronghold Games, Indie Boards and Cards & Action Phase Games will use contract manufacturing to make this game, freight forwarders to get games through customs, and 3rd parties like Amazon, the US Post Office, and FEDEX to ship the games to you \u2013 we don't control everything and there are lots of opportunities for delay. We have a track record of making everything work out for backers in the end \u2013 so please be confident and supportive of our efforts to get this great game into your hands.\n\nREFUND POLICY \nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus 20% for Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible.

This is the second title in the West Kingdom trilogy of games, following on from Architects of the West Kingdom.\n*Tax-friendly shipping to Canada and Portugal is only for English editions, not French or Portuguese.\nPaladins of the West Kingdom is set at a turbulent time of West Francia's story, circa 900 AD. Despite recent efforts to develop the city, outlying townships are still under threat from outsiders. Saracens scout the borders, while Vikings plunder wealth and livestock. Even the Byzantines from the east have shown their darker side. As noble men and women, players must gather workers from the city to defend against enemies, build fortifications and spread faith throughout the land. Fortunately you are not alone. In his great wisdom, the King has sent his finest knights to help aid in our efforts. So ready the horses and sharpen the swords. The Paladins are approaching.\nKey Features:\nUnique gameplay experience with interesting and tough decisions to make each round\n12 unique Paladins and more than 60 Townsfolk and Outsider Cards provide a huge amount of depth and replayability\nMultiple paths to victory, thanks to the Suspicion system, Attribute Tracks and wide array of potential Townsfolk and Outsider combinations\nJust the right amount of player interaction, with no take-that mechanisms\nIntuitive and easy to use solo play mode\nOver 250 cards and 240 wooden tokens\nAim of the Game\nThe aim of Paladins of the West Kingdom is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at game's end. Points are gained by building outposts and fortifications, commissioning monks and confronting outsiders. Each round, players will enlist the help of a specific Paladin and gather workers to carry out tasks. As the game progresses, players will slowly increase their faith, strength and influence. Not only will these affect their final score, but they will also determine the significance of their actions. The game is concluded at the end of the seventh round.\nClick here to download the rulebook\nClick here to visit the Steam page\n\nComponents\nTotal card counts for sleeving (including promos) :\n54 x 86mm - 126 Cards\n43 x 67mm - 129 Cards\nFor this Kickstarter we have decided not to offer any stretch goals. Instead, all components will be upgraded from day one! Linen finish, black core cards, premium wooden tokens, thicker box, thick player boards, solo mode, etc, etc. On top of that, we are also giving away 4 free promo packs with each copy of Paladins: \nTo add-on additional copies of Paladins, Architects or the metal coins, simply add the extra cost to your pledge level. This will need to be done during the campaign, as there will not be a pledge manager. All pledges are in NZD. There are no additional shipping costs for add-on items.\nNote that you cannot have multiple languages as part of the same pledge.\nTwo weeks after the campaign ends, we will send out surveys where you will have the chance to confirm what add-ons you included in your pledge.\nNote that each copy of Paladins will come with all 4 free promo sets and each copy of Architects will come with the 4 free promo sets from last year's Kickstarter campaign (excludes the Tax Stand promo).\nGroups:  Over the past 5 years we have always looked to improve how we handle larger group pledges. We want to offer the best prices, while keeping everything running smoothly for fulfillment. This year we have decided to keep things simple. Each add-on copy of Paladins or Architects is only $60 NZD. There will not be any further discounts beyond this.\nGerman Edition Add-ons: Due to fulfillment restrictions, Schwerkraft cannot offer add-ons for any reward levels. Only the 3 set reward levels are available for German editions.\nRetailers: For retailers interested in pledging for English versions of the games during the campaign, please send us a message for prices.

It comes with 6 colors in 1 unique sneaker, so you can switch between the rich LED colors that fully light up your feet.    \nFor the rebels and trendsetters, we created a true head-turner that doesn\u2019t compromise comfort for style. GLOW combines unique LED footwear that looks ridiculously cool with wearable, comfortable, well-made sneakers.\nWe created everything you wished for but never expected from LED shoes. You need sneakers that go with everything. Like, really. GLOW are so versatile that with only 1 pair, you get 6 colorful looks with vibrant LED colors. Plus the classic minimalist unlit style.\nTHE PROBLEM\nIn today's fast paced life, buying a pair of sneakers for every one of your outfits can cost you a small fortune. Plus all the environmental waste we cause because we go through so many pairs every year.\nTHE SOLUTION\nWith Glow, the 7 styles in 1 sneaker saves you the headache, cost and wardrobe space of buying multiple pairs of sneakers for all your different outfits! GLOW is also cruelty free, vegan, and sustainably produced.\nTo flawlessly combine functionality and style, we have partnered up with the top leading developers in LED technology. This patent-protected material allowed us to find a perfect balance that ensures your feet feel fresh and comfortable all the time.\nThe top part of the shoe is made of three main layers. First, a super comfortable liner that protects the most sensitive feet and then a forming cloth that gives your sneakers structure and keeps them looking great. It\u2019s all wrapped up in a high-tech optical fabric that looks like a million bucks, night and day.\nWe made sure your sneakers are easy to clean. You only have one job: keep the switch away from water. Other than that, you can soak and brush them lightly to keep yours looking great. \nFull disclosure: you can\u2019t swim while wearing GLOW. But then again, no one would see how lit (pun intended) they are underwater, so there\u2019s no point really. But they\u2019re so well built, that your LED sneakers are weather resistant and you'll be worry-free if you\u2019re caught out in the rain. The switch and charging port are securely covered so you know you\u2019re always safe. \nGLOW look and feel comfortable\u2026 because they actually are! Imagine stepping on a white, fluffy, ridiculously comfortable cloud. That\u2019s how wearing these sneakers feels like. The high tech memory foam insoles hug your feet and keep them cozy for as long as you need, so you can focus on enjoying life.\nAt only 10 oz (300 grams), your GLOW are as lightweight as regular everyday sneakers, yet they include all the LED tech! Take them anywhere you want to make an impression at - from the next festival you\u2019re attending, to the championship final your team is playing in.\nGLOW are versatile sneakers that adapt to your active lifestyle. If you're on the move all day or occasionally do some parkour, you'll be surprised to see how great of a friend your new sneakers are.\nRunning, cycling or even just walking at night can sometimes feel so dangerous, you might stop going out. At GLOW, we believe that you should be free to explore the world. Simply put on your GLOWs and you won\u2019t even have to hear the honking cars - everyone will see you in the darkest of nights and you\u2019ll feel safer than ever.\nWith GLOW, your creativity can be effortlessly expressed with a touch of a button. We celebrate being unique, escaping the ordinary and we definitely like to light up the world (but we usually start with a party).\nFor the parties that seem to and do last forever, the nights you get lost in your thoughts while running and the special moments you just can\u2019t stop having fun. GLOW makes the party in your feet last up to 14 hours. Fully recharged in only 2 hours, you\u2019ll be ready for an encore in no time!\nAt GLOW, we have a commitment towards sustainability. Our sneakers are made with high quality vegan leather and we are proud to announce that we are 100% cruelty free. We feel it's our responsibility to do our part to light up our world.\nFrom day to night, you can wear your GLOWs anywhere. Turn them on and change the colors on the go to transform your outfit from work to after-hours fun. Dare to be different and all your friends will love to gather around you. You\u2019ll be the superstar who brings people together.\nAs a parent, you would do anything for your kids. We love to see them smile, hear their delighted squeals of joy and feel their excitement - so GLOW comes in kids sizes. Now you\u2019ll have another thing that connects you and get to enjoy your precious time together even more.\nScroll down to the Sizing section to see the Shoe Sizes for kids!\n WATCH THE DEMO \nPLAY\n\nAre you unsure of how to pre-order on Kickstarter? Have no fear, we're here to help. \nHow To Add To Your Pledge\nIt's really simple! First select your reward and your country for the shipping destination. Then add up the Pledge amount displayed (includes shipping cost, if applicable) with the price of the add-on you want. Replace the pledge amount with the total cost you just added up. Click Pledge and you're done!\nLet's give you an example. Robert from the US wants to add:\n2 Glow Bags + Glow Sneakers (Super Early Bird reward)\nHe selects the reward, the country and adds up. \nCA$119 + 2x CA$55 = CA$229. \nHe types in 229 in the Pledge amount field and clicks \"Pledge\".\nWhen do I tell you my size? Your size info will be collected through a survey after the campaign ends. But you need to measure your feet before then, to make sure you can get GLOW in your size.\nOur community is at the heart of everything we do. We\u2019re building an awesome community where heroes like you, who like to stand out and be unique can connect. You\u2019ll always have a say in our brand\u2019s future. \n\nWe\u2019re a bunch of sneakers-loving freaks that got hung up on a pair of LED shoes that didn\u2019t exist. So we created it ourselves, after a year of trial, error, meetings, samples and countless prototypes. But we never gave up on our dream and we won\u2019t give up on yours. We\u2019re here to bring some real light in your life, in the form of high quality LED shoes!\nWe're the dream-and-do team: we dream of creating solutions that help heroes like you shine and we do our best to achieve that!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have spent the better part of the past year working on and refining the Yes We Glow shoes. Just how sneaker-loving freaks like to spend their time! We know them inside out and we have teamed up with a respected manufacturing partner that uses patented materials and has years of experience in the field.\n\nWe have set a realistic timeline so we can bring light(ness) to your feet as soon as possible, but also took into account the time needed to manufacture high quality shoes. That\u2019s something we are passionate about.\n\nSometimes, unforeseen stuff may happen. Sometimes, lights go out, that kind of stuff. While we can\u2019t possibly account for situations like these, we are committed to keeping you updated every step of the way. With YesWeGlow, you\u2019ll always be in the know.
