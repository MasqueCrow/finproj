[{"backer": "GreaterThanGames", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Mobile Support detailed in Update #9 \nPlayable demo expanded to include tier 2 cards - try it now at SIMMER \nNew mechanics for promos detailed in Update #9 \nMechanics for NighMist detailed in Update #3 \nMechanics for Xae detailed in Update #2 \nThe Game:\nAeon's End is a cooperative deck-building game where you struggle to defend the city of Gravehold from The Nameless and their hordes using unique abilities, powerful spells, and, most importantly of all, your wits. We are excited to be working with designer Kevin Riley from Action Phase Games, as well as Indie Boards and Cards to bring Aeon\u2019s End to Steam, with your help!\nAeon\u2019s End is right at home at Handelabra Games. The combination of deep strategy and cooperative gameplay will feel familiar to fans of our other games like Sentinels of the Multiverse and One Deck Dungeon. Like other deck-building games, you begin a game of Aeon\u2019s End with a basic deck and gradually improve it with new cards as you play. Aeon's End distinguishes itself by adding several innovative mechanics. Randomized turn order simulates the chaos of battle, and deck management rules invite careful planning of every discarded card.\nThe Project:\nWe are adapting Aeon\u2019s End into a digital tabletop game you can play on your Windows, macOS or Linux PC via Steam. As with our previous projects, we are working in Unity.  \nThe digital version of Aeon\u2019s End will cost $19.99 (USD), but backers can get the game for just $15. The 1.0 retail launch on Steam will include all Aeon's End base game content and features:\n8 playable mages, each with a unique starting card\n4 nemeses to defeat, each with their own mechanics\n27 unique player cards (gems, spells, & relics)\n22 general nemesis cards\n53 nemesis-specific cards\nLocal co-op play with 1-4 mages\nInteractive tutorial so you can learn the game while you play\nBrand-new music composed by Jean-Marc Giffin\nSteam Achievements\nSteam Cloud Saves\nAll unlocked promo cards and mages from stretch goals\nThe Kickstarter Edition delivered to backers at the $20 level or greater will also include the following:\nFree digital download of the Original Soundtrack ($5 value)\n Kickstarter Exclusive Digital Player Card Sleeves and Playmat - Alternate in-game background and card backs that show your support. More info here.\nAeon's End is already a huge success on the tabletop. It was Kickstarted in 2016, with standalone expansion War Eternal, and a new Legacy version in 2017 and 2018.  \nAlready familiar with Aeon's End? Visit this link to try the 5-minute demo now! Or read on for a preview of gameplay.\nAeon's End is a deck-building game. That means you start with a basic deck and gradually add cards to that deck as you gain new relics, gems, and spells to play.\nDuring the main phase, players typically begin by playing gems to gain aether. \nAether is the currency of Aeon's End that allows you to gain cards from the supply.\nAdd gems, spells, and relics to your hand to build your deck. \nYour goal is to defeat the nemesis while protecting the city of Gravehold. You damage the nemesis by using your spells. Spells must first be prepped to opened or focused breaches. Then, you can cast these spells on subsequent turns to deal damage.\nOne innovation in Aeon's End is variable turn order. After each round, the order of turns is shuffled, keeping you on your toes and echoing the chaos of battle.\nAnother innovation of Aeon's End is in deck management. Since you never shuffle your cards, you can carefully manage your deck by planning the order in which you discard your cards.\nOn the nemesis turns, watch out! The Nameless have many ways to turn the tide of battle, including dealing damage to your mages, attacking Gravehold itself, discarding your cards and more. \nIf your mages become exhausted by reaching 0 life, or if Gravehold is destroyed, you have lost. \nTo win, you must either reduce the nemesis to 0 life, or survive the entire nemesis deck and eliminate any remaining minions or powers in play.\nThanks to a new service called SIMMER, we can offer you a short demo of Aeon's End in your browser right now! This is a 5-10 minute experience aimed at giving you a feel for how the game will look and play in a general way. This is a pre-alpha build of the game and covers the first few rounds of a 2-mage game vs the Rageborne nemesis.\nYou can try the demo embedded below, but we recommend you click here to play the demo on SIMMER. Click the full-screen button below the lower right-hand corner of the game for the best experience. The demo works best on an up-to-date desktop browser that supports WebGL such as Chrome, Firefox, or Safari. Enable hardware acceleration in the options for best results. \nSIMMER is a great tool for developers to host builds of their Unity games for others to try out and play. Visit SIMMER.io for more info.\nYou can also check out a playthrough of the tabletop game here.\nDevelopment Streaming Schedule:\nWant to see how the game gets made? We\u2019ll be doing live development streams every Wednesday at 1 PM Eastern on our Twitch channel during the campaign to give you a peek behind the curtain. If you can't watch live, don't worry - we always post our stream to our YouTube channel afterwards. See below for the schedule of topics we will be covering each week:\n Wednesday November 7th: Spell-crafting - See how we implement a spell in the engine, hook it up in the UI, and create a damage effect animation! (Watch it here.)\n Wednesday November 14th: Making a Mage  - Watch us bring a mage to life by implementing their ability and starter card in the engine and UI. (Watch it here.)\n Wednesday November 21st: Tier 2 Arrives - Join John with special guest designer Kevin Riley to chat Aeon's End digital and see John bring tier 2 cards to the demo. (Watch it here.)\n Wednesday November 28th: Nameless Nemesis - Join David as he begins implementation of the Nemesis Carapace Queen.\nAeon\u2019s End will be delivered to backers as a Steam Key, redeemable on the Steam Service for 1 copy of the game. All Kickstarter backers will receive their Steam Key when the game first becomes available in Steam Early Access. All rewards will be delivered via BackerKit, a great service that streamlines the process of post-campaign surveys and fulfillment.   \nWe are planning to ship Aeon\u2019s End to Steam in the first half of 2019.\nWhat is Steam Early Access? \nEarly Access allows people to play games during their development and give feedback to the developers. We plan to bring Aeon\u2019s End to Steam Early Access several months before the game releases to retail.\nAll backers who choose a reward level that includes a copy of the game will be able to participate in Early Access if they choose.\nSame price as retail, but includes a copy of the Soundtrack + Kickstarter Exclusives!\n* What does it mean to become a member of the beta team?\nBecoming a beta team member means you will get access to the private beta of the game via Steam ahead of any retail or Early Access launch. You will play the game to help us discover bugs, report them, and help us make sure the game is as good as it can possibly be. \n* What does it mean to be a member of the alpha team?\nBecoming an alpha team member means you will get access to our alpha testing interface. This is a text-based, rules-only implementation of the game, used to test mechanics. You will play the game to help us discover bugs, report them, and help us make sure the game is as good as it can possibly be. The alpha testing interface will become available to backers shortly after the Kickstarter closes.\nMembers of the alpha and beta teams will be instrumental in helping shape how the new, digital-exclusive promos and mages will play! All content is tested first by the alpha team, then by the beta team before being released to the public.\nWe\u2019ve secured 2/3 of the development budget for the base game already, but we need your help to get version 1.0 completed and shipped in the first half of 2019. \nBut fully funding isn\u2019t the end of the story. The other reason we are using Kickstarter for this project is content. The base game provides countless hours of replayability with its 8 mages and 4 nemeses, but there\u2019s plenty more where that came from!\nAeon\u2019s End has lots of existing promo and bonus cards that we hope to bring to the digital game. We\u2019re also working directly with designer Kevin Riley and our other partners to craft brand-new exclusive content for the digital game. Kevin is taking full advantage of the digital medium to make new content that would be tricky (or impossible) in physical form.\nAnd finally, expansions. The world of Aeon\u2019s End has grown tremendously through expansions like The Depths, The Nameless, The Void, and The Outer Dark as well as the full-sized expansion War Eternal. Through stretch goals, we hope to secure enough funding to bring all that content to the digital game as quickly as possible.\nAs we mentioned above, we will be using BackerKit as our pledge manager for this campaign, which will help us manage add ons. Available add ons:\n $5 - One copy of the Original Soundtrack\n $15 - One additional Steam Key for the game\n $20 - One additional Steam Key for the Kickstarter Edition.\nUnfortunately, the higher levels cannot be added on, as they are limited. If you know someone who would like to become a member of the Alpha or Beta teams, you should have them back the campaign themselves.\n Promo-Packs include 1 Player card and 1 Nemesis card. Some cards are existing promos, while some will be brand new!\n Into the Breach: In her search for the domain of the Nameless, Mist has opened a breach to a strange world known as Mynerva, but someone has returned in her place!\n Xae from One Deck Dungeon joins Aeon's End as a new, digital-exclusive, playable mage, designed for digital Aeon\u2019s End by Kevin Riley. (More info in this update.)\nAlthough she longs to return to Gravehold, for now, Mist joins the heroes of One Deck Dungeon as they battle in Mynerva! Mist for One Deck Dungeon is being designed by Chris Cieslik of Asmadi Games and will be a FREE addition to the game!\n First Expansion: The Nameless will be added to the development schedule! This expansion adds 2 nemeses and 1 breach mage to the game, as well as new gems, relics, spells, and minions. You will be able to add to your pledge to receive this expansion. \n OblivAeon's End: After tapping into the power of the Void, NightMist found herself pulled in and trapped for what felt like eons. So, when she felt a weakness in the fabric of the Void, she lept for it, tearing her way into a new reality and leaving what she knew behind. Now, the Void-powered creature who was once Faye Diamond has materialized in a new place called \u201cGravehold\u201d. (More info in this update.)\n NightMist from Sentinels of the Multiverse joins Aeon's End as a new digital exclusive playable Mage, designed for digital Aeon\u2019s End by Kevin Riley.\n Second Expansion: The Depths expansion will be added to the development schedule. This expansion adds 1 nemesis and 3 breach mages to the game, as well as new spells, relics, gems, and minions. You will be able to add to your pledge to receive this expansion. \nCheck back for more stretch goals as the campaign continues!\nShow your Aeon's End spirit with custom avatars! Check them out here.\nThis is just a sample, more at the link!\nHelp us spread the word on social media to unlock Bonus Packs! Each bonus pack will contain:\n1 new digital player card sleeve\n1 new digital nemesis card sleeve\n1 new digital playmat\nThese items are alternate card backs and backgrounds that let you customize your Aeon's End experience.\nShares, retweets, likes, new follows and subscribes, we'll be tracking them all through the campaign!

Now it's time to have a friendly competition with your fellow homebrewers and see who can become the club's best brewer!\nHomebrewers is a competitive game for two to five players designed by Ben Rosset (Brew Crafters, Brew Crafters Travel Card Game, Between Two Cities) & Matthew O'Malley (Diner, Between Two Cities, The Princess Bride: A Battle of Wits) and illustrated by Adam Rebottaro, artist of the award-winning game Sentinels of the Multiverse, and SaRae Henderson.\nHomebrewers comes with a \"chalkboard\" scoring board, custom screen-printed action dice, \"garage\" player boards, flavor cards and more! Check out the complete list of components below!\nHomebrewers is an engine-building and dice-trading game where your dice represent the actions you can take: buying ingredients, participating in monthly events, adding flavors to your recipes, and of course, brewing beer! Homebrewers is played over eight months (represented by the eight rounds of the game). Each month you meet with your homebrewing club (trade phase) and then work on your brewing (action phase).\nYou\u2019ll be crafting your own unique beer recipes in four categories: Ale, Porter, Stout, and IPA. Each time you brew a particular recipe, your quality level for that recipe will increase.\nYou\u2019ll gain reputation in two main ways. First, by moving up the quality tracks for the four beer categories, in order to win medals at Summerfest and Octoberfest. \nAnd second, by crafting your recipes to meet the particular tastes of a panel of judges at Octoberfest.\nAt the end of eight months, if you\u2019ve gained the most reputation as your club\u2019s best brewer, you win!\nCheck out these Kickstarter Live Stream play-throughs!\nEager to get brewing?

They provide players with unique abilities that will give them a leg up on the competition and influence strategy and gameplay.\nMeet this year's homebrewing competitors, learn their stories, and marvel at their player abilities!\nTony Hendricks\nEveryone loves Tony. He\u2019s the kind of guy that can be identified in a crowd by his laugh alone. It\u2019s the kind of laugh that starts as a quiet chuckle and erupts into an infectious roar that leaves the whole room laughing. When you share a beer with Tony, you\u2019re guaranteed to have a good time. And if you ever need a helping hand or just want someone to go out on a limb with you, Tony\u2019s the guy you call. So of course when his friend wanted to learn how to brew, he jumped in with both feet and it was one of the best decisions he ever made. Though he may be humble, his hard work and delicious brews speak for themselves. As last year\u2019s champ, Tony\u2019s back again to defend his title.\nDefending Champion: Once during the action phase, you may pay $1 to raise the quality of your lowest beer by 1. \nKatherine Montgomery\nAs the CEO of a successful business, work never stops for Katherine. After learning about the homebrewing competition while visiting the local beer festival, she decided to enter to keep work from taking over her every waking moment. She runs her garage like she runs her business - with pride, passion, and serious organization! Not a drop of beer is ever spilled and her equipment is as clean as the day it was bought. She\u2019s been having so much fun that if she wins the championship, she just might retire and start up a microbrewery!\nCleanroom Standards: Once during the action phase, you may pay $1 to fully sanitize your track. \nAndrew Lucas\nFor Andrew, brewing beer is more than a pastime; it\u2019s an opportunity to craft memories. As a stay-at-home dad, Andrew relishes any opportunity to spend time with friends and family while brewing. You\u2019ll never find an empty keg at these backyard BBQs! He\u2019s even been close to winning the homebrewing competition a few times, but the chance to meet new people and learn new recipes is really what it\u2019s all about for him. Still, it would be nice if his family could see him holding that trophy high!\nFill the Keg: Once during the action phase when using a brew action, you may pay $1 to keep the ingredient token in that beer instead of moving it to the sanitation track.   \nColt Roberts- character art sketch\nColt Roberts\nColt brings his experience as a life coach into each brew he makes. He sees brewing as a chance to bring happiness to others, one brew at a time. Within just minutes of meeting you, Colt can calculate and cultivate the perfect beer palette to match your personality. Just like every personality has different traits, every beer he brews has traits that makes them individual and unique. To ensure that he captures every nuance, Colt is very methodical with his brewing process. He hopes that this year he can gauge the plans of his competitors and the palette of each judge to craft the perfectly balanced blend of flavors to win him the gold.\nWork the Crowd: Once during the action phase, you may pay $1 to take any 1 revealed top calendar action. \nGabriel Ruiz\nGabe's been active and ambitious his entire life. He started working for his father's construction business right out of high school while also teaching wrestling for his younger brother's middle school and joining a business fraternity at the local college. Last year, one of his fraternity's favorite alumni, Tony Hendricks, won the local homebrewing competition. When he heard about it, Gabe knew had to give it a shot. With his indefatigable attitude, he's bound to give Tony a run for his money. \nThe Contender: Once during the action phase, you may pay $1 to brew your lowest quality beer at 1 quality, ignoring ingredients and sanitation. \nEvie \"O'Brewin\" O'Brien- character art sketch\nEvie \u201cO\u2019Brewin\u201d O'Brien\nEvie may be this year\u2019s youngest competitor, but she\u2019s full of fire, spunk, and creative concoctions. While some call her methods chaotic, she calls them exciting. You may not think those flavors belong together, but Evie will certainly give it a go and when she\u2019s done, you\u2019ll be back for more. When she\u2019s not brewing beers, Evie can be found brewing coffee at her cat caf\u00e9, Meow We\u2019re Brewing. With the help of her faithful feline companions, Evie is poised to dazzle this year\u2019s judges with some brew combinations they never thought possible.  \nRisk Taker: Once during the action phase, you may pay $1 to draw the top 2 cards of the flavor deck. Keep 1 and discard the other. \nDr. Ananya Patel\nWhen Ananya decided to follow in her father\u2019s footsteps and become a doctor, her family tried to talk her out of it. She \u201cdidn\u2019t have the grades\u201d, they said. Three years and a LOT of studying later, she started med school with her head held high. When Ananya decided that she wanted to save lives as an ER doctor, her colleagues tried to talk her out of it. Four years later, she finished her emergency medicine rotation with offers to join three hospitals and two clinics. When Ananya asked about joining the homebrewing competition, other brewers made the mistake of telling her that she was too old to take the pressure. Two months later, her garage was full of equipment and her first test beer ready. Though her competition is usually with herself, this time she\u2019s ready for some friendly competition with others. \nExtra Mile: Once during the action phase, you may pay $1 to roll one extra die. This die cannot be sold or changed.\nHomebrewers can be played with as few as two people. If playing this way, we've included a third, automated brewer for you to compete against, named Charlie.\nCharlies Cards - Not Final Art\nCharlie is a \"homebrewer\" who only comes into play in a 2-person game. Charlie receives 3 dice, 4 quality markers for each of the beers, and their deck of shuffled Charlie Cards. \nThe first player will deal 5 Charlie Cards face-down next to the game board, returning the remaining cards to the box. At the start of the trade phase the first player for the current round rolls Charlie's 3 dice and sets them beside Charlie's card. Starting with the first player and taking turns, everyone may trade a single die with Charlie or pass. Once both players have consecutively passed they are free to trade with each other. Next, first player will reveal the topmost card from Charlie's deck and advance Charlie's player token(s) on the recipe(s) shown equal to the number of quality levels shown. \nCharlie cannot win the game, which is why they don't get a scoring token, but they do compete with you for medals and honorable mention so keep your eye on the prize, and the judges! \nNow that we've mentioned the items in each pledge level, and we've explained the story and gampley of Homebrewers, let's talk about the mini-expansion!\nHomebrewers: Getting Equipped is a mini-expansion for Homebrewers that pumps up the engine building aspect of the game and increases the game\u2019s depth and replayability. \nHomebrewers: Getting Equipped is a deck of 25 unique pieces of equipment, each one giving the brewer who installs it a special power. At the beginning of the game, players will draft the equipment cards, with each player selecting five that only they can chose from to install. Each player can only install four out of their five equipment cards, though. During the game, you can pay the dollar cost shown on an equipment card to install that piece of equipment in your garage. Installing the right mix of equipment and making good use of them can make all the difference in the battle for title of Best Homebrewer! Each game that you play will see you drafting and installing different equipment. With over 53,000 different combinations of 5 equipment cards that you can draft, every game you play will provide a unique challenge and strategy. \nTo read more about the mini expansion and the Start Cards, check out this update!\nBelow, we have some images and details about the various add-ons we are offering as part of this Kickstarter campaign! However, if you are new to Kickstarter, it might not be clear what we mean by \"add-ons\" or how they work, so here's a quick overview!\nBasically, these are items that you can add to your basic pledge level. All that you have to do when you back this campaign is increase your pledge level by the appropriate amount for each add-on that you would like. Then, once the campaign ends, all of the money you pledged will be added as a credit to our pledge manager software. You'll be able to log in, look at how much you pledged during the campaign, and select the specific pledge level and all of the specific add ons that you would like to receive!\nFor example, if you decide to back this campaign at the \"Ale\" level, you'll pledge $35 and receive Homebrewers as well as the Homebrewers: Getting Equipped mini-expansion. Say that you also want a copy of the \u201cMarketing Basics\u201d promo pack for your copy of Brew Crafters that you picked up at your local gaming store last year, as well as a single pint glass. You would then add $5 to your pledge for Marketing Basics, and $30 for the pint glass, for a total pledge of $70. However, you would keep your Reward selection at the $35 \"Ale\" level, since that is the base level that you want to receive.\nMICROBREWERS\nSome of you might be wondering why this box looks a lot like Brew Crafters Travel Card Game. You're not wrong! This is a new and improved version, now titled Microbrewers. There are three main differences between the new Microbrewers and the original Brew Crafters Travel Card Game.\nFirst, we've added two new card types: The Research Lab and the Tasting Room. The Research Lab encourages you to brew specialty beers that use fruit and coffee and balances out the number of worker and equipment cards in the game. \nMicrobrewers: Research Lab\nThe Tasting Room scores you end-game points for having a variety of different ingredients showing on your brewery upgrades.  Adding these two new card types means you\u2019ll see a greater variety of cards in your hand, making the decision about which card to play on each turn more interesting.\nMicrobrewers: Tasting Room\nSecond, instead of passing being the third option for the main action of your turn, you now have the option to draw 1 additional card, meaning you can add 3 cards to your hand on your turn instead of 2. This can be crucial late in the game, giving you the 1 additional card you need to make an epic brew or install a critical brewery upgrade on your last turn.\nThird, the game lasts one additional round. Now, when the game's end is triggered, players finish the final round and play one more full round. This provides a more satisfying feeling of completion. It allows you to better plan for the end of the game and avoids the game ending abruptly without giving you the chance to take a final turn.\nBREW CRAFTERS\nBrew Crafters components\nBrew Crafters is the first in this line of brewing games designed by Ben Rosset. In Brew Crafters, you are the owner of a local craft brewery. Each brewery has access to a variety of equipment upgrades, local farms, markets, and a plethora of specialty workers, ensuring a high level of replayability and numerous strategic avenues. Work hard to manage resources, use your workers wisely, and develop your brewing line to create the finest beer recipes. It won't always be an easy task, but with some hops and hope you can craft the sweetest suds and build the best brewery in town. \nCUSTOM HOMEBREWERS PINT GLASSES\nWhat better way to enjoy the creation of unique brews than in custom pint glasses? They are custom made in Wisconsin and etched with the Homebrewers logo.\nThe render of the glass on the left is an example of what the final product will look like. The full pint glass to the right is a picture of our sample glasses. (Please note the logo will be updated to reflect the final Homebrewers logo on the box.)\nYou may ask, what\u2019s so cool about these pint glasses that you\u2019d pay $25-$30 each for them? Well, as pint glass connoisseurs, we\u2019ve got a ton of opinions about custom glassware, and these are among the best we\u2019ve ever seen. Most small production runs of glassware are light-weight, low quality glass and are printed instead of etched. Those glasses break easily, feel unsatisfying in the hand, and the image washes off after a few trips through the dishwasher. These glasses, on the other hand, are sturdy with great weight, and the logo will be etched into the glass and non-removable. Several of us have glassware made by the same supplier, and it has held up and still looks great after several years and hundreds of trips through the dishwasher. We love them, and think you will too! \nMARKETING BASICS PROMO PACK\n\"Marketing Basics\" Brew Crafters Promo Pack\nThe \u201cMarketing Basics\u201d promo pack was offered on the original Brew Crafters Kickstarter way back in 2013! We recently reorganized our warehouse and found a box of them, so we\u2019re happy to offer them as a $5 add on to this Kickstarter if anyone is interested!  \nWhat does the \u201cMarketing Basics\u201d promo pack add? It introduces three alternate BASIC recipes that advanced players can use instead of the original recipes of Everyday Ale, Simply Stout and Pleasantly Porter. They're a bit harder to brew, which means players will have to pump up their brewing prowess! It also ads one new Skilled Worker, the Marketing Manager.  \nJust to be clear, this is a promo pack for the original Brew Crafters game, NOT for Homebrewers. Also, if you were a backer of the original Brew Crafters Kickstarter campaign, you already have this and don\u2019t need to add it on.\nBREW CRAFTERS UPGRADE STICKER\nBrew Crafters 1st Ed. Upgrade Sticker\nThe \u201cBrew Crafters 1st Edition Upgrade Sticker\u201d lets you upgrade the \"Market Action Board\" in your 1st Edition of Brew Crafters to match the version in the 2nd Edition (current printing). We have added it here by popular request to help some people who want it save on shipping!  \nNote that this is an upgrade for the FIRST printing of Brew Crafters. If you are getting a copy of Brew Crafters through this campaign (or have bought it in the past year or so), this sticker is of no use to you at all!\n If we exceed our funding goals we will create these awesome custom components and art:\n$35,000 - If unlocked, each copy of Homebrewers will include 5 custom beer glass quality track markers (5 custom shapes, 4 markers per player)!\n$40,000 - If unlocked, each copy of Homebrewers will include a custom beer bottle first player token! \n$45,000 - If unlocked, each copy of Homebrewers will include 16 custom molded dice!\n$50,000 - If unlocked, each copy of Homebrewers will include unique art for each and every flavor card, from Kimchi to Gingerbread! \n\"Every action in Homebrewers feels incredibly satisfying. You're always moving towards something, and the strategic element of moving up the tracks is very rewarding.\" - Ryan Schoon, Man vs. Meeple.\n\"Homebrewers  feels big and dynamic, with interesting ways of making heavier concepts work with an approachable package. I really dig this game!\" - Jack Eddy, The Cardboard Herald.\n MeepleGamers Homebrewers Preview \n\"I really liked what I saw from Homebrewers...a very enjoyable engine builder with a unique theme and a quick play time.\" - Kevin Billman, MeepleGamers.\n  Here are the shipping charges for this campaign! We've got a lot of details below if you want to know why your particular country has the shipping charges that it does.\n US: $0\n Canada: $5\n Australia: $35\n Europe (EU+Norway+Switzerland): $10 + VAT\n Other: $45\nInternational shipping charges will be charged after the campaign ends via our pledge manager. This is to make sure that we have two separate transactions from everyone (one for the pledge, and another for the shipping), which makes it easier to do various accounting things and to submit VAT paperwork.\nFor US backers, we are offering free shipping. This is not because we have invented a teleporter, and shipping is suddenly free. We will still pay a substantial amount to ship each parcel to US backers, both in actual shipping charges, and in labor & materials. However, we know that everyone likes the idea of free shipping (including us!), and has come to expect it in Kickstarter campaigns, so we are subsidizing shipping enough to make US shipping free.\nFor Canadians, we are offering $5 shipping. This also covers import taxes and customs duties, which we will pay at the point when the products enter Canada. Of course, $5 is not the actual cost of shipping and import duties to Canada. It is not even the difference between the actual cost of Canadian shipping and the actual cost of US shipping, which is more like $7-$8. This means that US backers are subsidizing Canadian backers slightly, in the amount of $2-$3 per parcel. However, we really want to make our games as accessible as possible in Canada, and $5 is a nice, low, round number.\nFor Australians, we are offering $35 shipping. This also covers import taxes and customs duties, which we will pay at the point when the products enter Australia. Even though it might seem high, $35 is not the actual cost of shipping to Australia. It is not even the difference between the actual cost of Australian shipping and the actual cost of US shipping, which is more like $40-$45. This means that US backers are subsidizing Australian backer in the amount of $5-$10 per parcel. However, we really want to make our games as accessible as possible in Australia because we know how hard it can be to get US products in AUS.\nFor Europeans (including EU countries as well as Norway and Switzerland, but unfortunately not Russia or other non-EU countries), we are offering $10 shipping + VAT. What does this mean? Well, it turns out that the EU has been really tightening the rules on VAT and import duties recently as a result of widespread VAT fraud on the part of foreign companies. You can read some of the details here, but the summary is that, according to EU law, any items imported into the EU are subject to VAT charges (generally 24% in the case of board games) based on the actual sale price PLUS the actual shipping cost. That means that, for a $35 game with $10 shipping, the 24% VAT will be assessed against the total $45 price, and will come out to approximately $10.80.\nNote that this law applies no matter how we fulfill the games. If we ship from the US, each parcel is subject to the VAT charge once it enters the EU. On the other hand, if we ship a bunch of games to a fulfillment center in the EU, the whole shipment is subject to VAT when it enters the EU, and, even though the games are arriving in bulk, the VAT is based on the actual sales price to consumers (in this case, on Kickstarter), not the lower wholesale or manufacturing cost, so this method doesn\u2019t actually save any money on VAT charges (though there can be other benefits).\nEuropean Shipping Questions\nQ: So, why are you charging VAT separately from shipping charges for Europeans?\nA: For two reasons. First, as we mentioned above, the VAT charges are based on the sale price + shipping. If we include VAT as part of the \u201cshipping\u201d charge, EU customs is likely to consider that whole charge to be \u201cshipping\u201d and charge VAT based on the full amount, including what we already charged for VAT! Second, the exact VAT rate is subject to a lot of fluctuation right now, both due to the ongoing EU crackdown on internet retailers, and due to the ongoing low-level trade war between the US and the EU (which we think is incredibly dumb but can\u2019t do anything about). Fortunately, we should be able to ship the games to Europe directly from China and avoid any US-EU tariffs.\nQ: Ok, so, how much am I going to pay to get this game in Europe?\nA: There is a fixed $10 fee for shipping, which you will pay when the Kickstarter ends. Then, before the campaign is fulfilled, we will calculate each European backer\u2019s VAT and charge you for VAT before shipping out your parcel.\nQ: Will I have to pay any customs clearance fees or anything when I receive my shipment?\nA: No, you will not! We will have Spiral Galaxy Games in the UK fulfill this Kickstarter for European backers, which means that, after we charge you for VAT through our pledge manager, we\u2019ll pay all of the VAT and import duties on the games. Then, Spiral Galaxy will ship all of your parcels out from within the EU and avoid any weird delays or further charges.\nQ: Where are you getting all of this information? It seems dumb and wrong and I don\u2019t like it.\nA: We talked to a lot of shipping companies, attorneys, and other professionals about the implications of EU law and how, exactly, VAT works. For a decent summary, the government of Finland has a pretty helpful website (and the information is, for the most part, broadly applicable across the EU).\nQ: Wait, but [insert other Kickstarter here] shipped stuff to Europe for way cheaper than this. Why can\u2019t you just do what they did?\nA: They either lost a ton of money on shipping, or they committed customs fraud, and we don\u2019t want to do either of those things. \nQ: You say above that you are subsidizing shipping to Canadians and Australians. Why don\u2019t you subsidize shipping to Europeans?\nA: We do! The $10 we are charging for shipping is not the actual cost of shipping and import duties to Europe. It is not even the difference between the actual cost of European shipping and the actual cost of US shipping, which is more like $12-$20 (there is a lot of variance, because it depends on the size of the shipment we are importing to Europe, and to which country in Europe the shipment is heading). This means that US backers are subsidizing Canadian backers slightly, in the amount of $2-$10 per parcel.\nQ: Wait, why is the shipping price the same for every backer level? Shouldn\u2019t larger parcels cost more to ship?\nA: That is a very astute observation. Yes, they do! However, to make things easier, we are charging a flat rate. We have based all of the examples in this section off of the smallest parcel on this Kickstarter. For any of the larger pledge levels, our shipping costs will be higher, but you will not pay any extra for shipping (VAT will be higher based on the higher pledge).\nQ: Why do Norway and Switzerland have to follow these rules? They aren\u2019t in the EU!\nA: That is true! However, the customs regimes in Norway and Switzerland are very similar to those of the EU, by design.\nQ: What about Brexit?\nA: Brexit could complicate a lot of things, but what, exactly, it might complicate about this depends on the final form it takes. We\u2019ll cross that bridge if/when we come to it, and let you know about anything we wind up doing to work through it.\nQ: I hate VAT; is there anything I can do about it?\nA: Us, too!

Check out the FAQ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project that involves the production and manufacture of a good to be delivered, there is certainly a real chance for hiccups, delays, and more than one or two gremlins gumming up the works along the way. Many boardgame projects on Kickstarter have been seriously hampered by art production delays, problems with an overseas factory, missing units, and one shipping snafu after another.\n\nLuckily, we have a few projects under our belt, and have dealt with many of those snags along the way. We try to plan for all contingencies, and we've been fairly successful with that in our past projects.\n\nWe won't lie - stuff happens. Delays can occur. Sometimes you have to go back and forth on color samples six times just to get the color right, and even then the color isn't perfect. But what we do promise is that we will hold ourselves to the same high standards we expect from other board game publishers and our previous projects, and we will be completely honest and open with each of you every step of the way.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "Ale", "descp": "The perfect base brew for your Homebrewing experience.\nINCLUDES:\nOne (1) Copy of Homebrewers\nFREE Shipping to US!\nPLUS One (1) Copy of Homebrewers: Getting Equipped mini-expansion", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["193 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "Porter", "descp": "A generous amount of pale ale malt (and a dash of Microbrewers) make this an award winning brew.\nINCLUDES:\nOne (1) Copy of Homebrewers\nFREE Shipping to US!\nPLUS One (1) Copy of Microbrewers (at a $5 discount)\nOne (1) Copy of Homebrewers: Getting Equipped mini-expansion", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["380 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 80 or more", "title": "Stout", "descp": "This robust addition to our lineup includes even more brewing action with both Microbrewers and Brew Crafters!\nINCLUDES:\nOne (1) Copy of Homebrewers\nFREE Shipping to US!\nPLUS One (1) Copy of Brew Crafters (at a $20 discount)\nOne (1) Copy of Homebrewers: Getting Equipped mini-expansion\nOne (1) Copy of Microbrewers (at a $5 discount)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["118 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 130 or more", "title": "IPA", "descp": "Whether using East Coast or West Coast flavor profiles, IPAs are great beers for trying new, complex recipes!

What seems like a typical bank heist reveals itself to be just the tip of a much more sinister plan! Create your hero, lead your team, and save the world!\nBuild your Team - select from the many available heroes and unlock more throughout \nCharacter Personalities - heroes will have likes, dislikes, and preferences which influence the mission \nFull story campaign - writers and creators from Sentinel Comics \nFreeform movement - Turn Based game that allows you to move anywhere \nSquad dynamics - heroes or villains can work together for more powerful actions \nLiving Environments - multiple objectives, interactions and dangers \nAdaptive AI - enemies will start to adjust to current tactics and also make long term changes to strategy\nWhat kind of hero will you be? \nCreate your Hero - choose backstory, archetype, powers, and appearance \nSentinels of Freedom is a single player turn based tactics game for PC and Mac. The game will feature Episode 1 \"Cold War\" - as a self contained story - on release. Episode 1 will feature 4 core chapters, each with many levels, new heroes and villains, along with hero upgrades.\n During initial design, we wanted a blend of classic turn based games along with some new mechanics to enhance the genre. We spent a lot of time talking about our experience playing the physical games and how to bring some of those feeling into the digital space without simply copying these game. The goal was to create a fresh experience with strong roots within the amazing universe of Sentinel Comics. The team is excited to share a couple mechanics in particular. \nChoose the character's backstory, personality, power source and archetype - each heavily impacting your final character. Heroes have \"stances\" that provide boosts to certain stats like enhanced dodging or even flight along with powerful sets of abilities and can be fully customized to fit your play style.\nRead more about Hero Creation\nWhen customizing your own hero or one of the many pre-made heroes, players can set up different stances. A stance has a theme which will influence the characters stats and available abilities. Stances are typically set once a character's turn is complete to prepare them for the next activation, although other stances are still available during a character's turn by spending available action points.\nBunker Operation and Turret Mode\nFor example, Bunker may have Operations, Recharge, and Turret mode stances. While in Operations mode, he has full movement and access to moderate damage attacks. To deal some massive damage, Bunker will need to switch to Turret Mode, which will make Bunker immobile but give him higher defence and access to super powerful attacks. \nLearn more about stances on our blog!\nSupport and Vigilance actions add life to the battlefield when characters perform additional actions out of sequence, triggered by special conditions. When a character performs an action, support actions allow other characters to take part or enhance that action, like a character creating a distraction to reduce the target's dodge ability before an attack lands. Positioning your team to take advantage of these extra actions can be critical to the success of a mission.\nVigilance allows an inactive character to react to the active character based on various triggers, such as moving through their line of sight. Each character has a \"vigilance zone\" around them which sets the chance of the vigilance action happening. These actions can go much further than the standard overwatch with actions like \"keep cover\" which allows a character in cover to try and find new cover when flanked.\nThe \"learning AI\" allows the enemies to change their tactics over the course of the game. This could mean introducing resistances to certain types of attacks through new armor or new attacks helping them break through your defenses. Keeping a diverse and ever-changing strategy will help combat the learning AI.\nWill you be able to rescue the hostages in time? Can you survive the chaos until more defensive actions are taken? Initiative can have a major impact in situations like these. In Sentinels of Freedom, initiative determines the turn order for all characters and events in a round.  Actions from previous rounds can have a major impact on initiative.\nTake a closer look at Initiative on our blog\nPledge Levels...\nSideKick \nGet a reduced cost digital copy of the Sentinels of Freedom game DRM Free for Windows and Mac\nINCLUDES: Digital Copy of Sentinels of Freedom\nHero \nAlong with the Digital Game, stay up to date with early access to the character builder and get more digital content.

The team has spent several years honing our skills by building games for a variety of people and companies. Our latest released game is Super Dungeon Tactics on Steam. Over the past few years, we have made a myriad of strong friendships and unique game ideas which have lead to developing Sentinels of Freedom. Underbite Games will continue to develop games that bridge the game between the analog and digital gaming. \nAbout Super Dungeon Tactics: http://store.steampowered.com/app/463160/Super_Dungeon_Tactics/ \nSince Super Dungeon Tactics released, we have continued to add and improve the game. We are also releasing the game on Xbox, PS4 and Switch summer of 2018. \nAbout Greater Than Games, LLC\nGreater Than Games, LLC is a leading tabletop game developer and publisher based out of St. Louis, Missouri. Established in 2011, Greater Than Games is well-known for delivering engaging, richly-themed, highly-replayable card and board games. \nLook for Greater Than Games titles in major markets worldwide.\nComposer: Jean-Marc Giffin of Sentinels of the Multiverse The Video Game\nTo help reduce cost, bugs and time to release, Underbite is using the Unity3D game engine. Our team has been working in Unity for many years allowing us to focus on gameplay and design instead of developing or struggling with a game engine. \nUnity3D also allows us to potentially reach other platforms through  future updates more efficiently. \nWork began September of 2017 on design, prototypes, and art style discovery. During this time we also created a physical version of the game with an attack simulation software. This allowed our designers to iterate very quickly without having to constantly change code. Once the design was solid, we then started digital prototypes but still referenced the physical version to try out new ideas. \nCurrently, we have a strong start to the initial game in all areas. Here is a brief estimate of where the project stands: \nDesign: 75-80%\nArt: 20-30%\nStory: 70-80%\nDevelopment: 30-35%\nWe are looking for help from the community to make Sentinels of Freedom go beyond what we can achieve through self funding. Underbite has taken the 1st step and risk by developing a strong playable prototype and design documentation. We will continue to develop the core of the game in anticipation of a successful campaign. \nUnderbite Games has committed resources to developing Chapter 1 of Episode 1. This will end up representing a majority of the core development (coding) tasks that are used throughout the rest of the game. Along with development, design for the entire game will be complete to ensure the game scales correctly. Also during this time, art for the entire Episode 1 will be at around 50% complete.\nThe funding goal allows us to finish the remaining development and art tasks to complete Episode 1 and ship a complete game with no compromises to the core design. \nWith your help, we can not only reach our goal of Episode 1, but continue into more episodes along with additional heroes, missions and features. \nWe greatly thank you for taking the time to review our Kickstarter and hope you will support us :)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGame development has its challenges but most of the team at Underbite Games has had over 7 years in the industry including the release of our own title Super Dungeon Tactics. \n\nOne of the big challenges is creating strong core gameplay that is also fun from start to finish. To minimize this risk, we took it upon ourselves to design and develop this core gameplay experience along with a significant amount of content before coming to Kickstarter. \n\nWith any story driven game, the writing itself is also a major challenge. In order to address this, we are working with the masters of story telling, Christopher Badell and Adam Rebottaro of Greater Than Games.\n\nWe are ready for the challenge.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Citizen", "descp": "Thanks for your support.

This meant I felt like I really shouldn\u2019t take heroes with me who primarily didn\u2019t do one (preferably both) of those, preferably in the same stance.

The reason this is is that the reward promos are donated by publishers and they only have the ability to provide a certain number of them to us - roughly 1500. We cant exceed those limits. So we have those limits imposed on all the levels that receive promos.

Shuffle the deck, then battle with monsters, claim your loot, and continue deeper until you defeat the boss. We're bringing this nail-biting tabletop adventure to your computer via Steam. We plan to also launch the game on iPad and Android tablets (see the Mobile section below).\nCurrent Status:\nFor more info on tablet support, see Update #6\nFor more info on the Treasure Chest, see Update #12\nOne Deck Dungeon Wallpapers in Update #5 and Update #13\nWe are adapting One Deck Dungeon into a game you can play on your Windows, macOS or Linux PC via Steam. Already a success on the tabletop, One Deck Dungeon was Kickstarted in 2016 and a full expansion called Forest of Shadows was Kickstarted earlier this year. \nOur goal with any adaptation is to preserve what makes a game great, while bringing the fun into the digital realm. We have been working on the game for some time now, but we need your help! Our $20,000 goal is enough to complete development on the core game and launch it on Steam. But the more money we raise, the better we can make One Deck Dungeon! Stretch goals include additional heroes, dungeons, new features, and even the Forest of Shadows expansion. \nWe plan to also launch the game on iPad and Android tablets. You can help launch the game earlier by backing at the Mobile Dungeon level. See the Mobile section below for details!\nOne Deck Dungeon begins when you choose your party: a single hero or a pair of two heroes. Each hero is equipped with the ability to vanquish all of her foes in the dungeon. The base game comes with 5 varied choices: \nMage - There's rarely a problem in the dungeon she can't solve with a spell.\nWarrior - Her favorite dungeon activity is squashing her opponents immediately.\nRogue - Watch in awe as she dispatches monsters with style.\nArcher - Accurate, brilliant, catastrophically deadly.\nPaladin - She seeks out danger and shields her allies from deadly enemies.\nNext you choose the dungeon and boss you will be facing. Each dungeon has 3 floors you need to battle through, with a unique set of dastardly effects which are added to every encounter. Finally (if you endure all the dungeon throws at you) you will reach the boss, who you then must defeat to win the game. The base game comes with 5 choices here as well: \nDragon\u2019s Cave - The thick-skinned wyvern who occupies this dungeon prefers her heroes on the crispy side.\nYeti\u2019s Cavern - If you can survive the freezing winds and biting cold, an abominable snowman awaits.\nHydra\u2019s Reef - Chop off one head, and another appears! This regenerating venomous monstrosity is a slippery foe.\nLich\u2019s Tomb - Hordes of undead foes, evil curses, and magical wards. What could possibly go wrong?\nMinotaur\u2019s Maze - Abandon all hope, you who enter here! \nThe deck of 44 encounter cards contains all the other challenges you'll face in One Deck Dungeon:\nThe doors you must open to progress \nThe encounters, with monsters to defeat or perils to surpass \nThe loot you earn as either items, skills, potions, or XP\nAs well as the time you spend to do all of the above! \nIt's time to enter the dungeon and explore: \nEverything you do costs time, discarding cards from the encounter deck and advancing the hourglass. When you enter a room, you are then faced with an encounter which can be either a combat or a peril. \nCombat encounters pit you against the monsters and denizens of the dungeon. You roll dice based on your hero's attributes and cover the challenge boxes on the card.\nPeril encounters are traps or other environmental obstacles you must overcome. You'll have to decide which of your attributes to use - for example, either climbing around a pit of spikes using your raw strength, or jumping over it with your cat-like agility.\nEither way, you'll want to cover as many challenge boxes as possible. Any left uncovered will cause damage and time lost, but you'll still make it past (if you aren't reduced to zero health). And then it's time to claim the loot!\nEach encounter card gives you 3 options for loot, and you can only choose one. XP levels up your heroes, and items increase your attributes. Or you can learn a new skill or potion to use for powerful combos!\nEvery time you run out of time in the hourglass (by emptying the deck), you come upon a set of stairs that will take you deeper into the dungeon. Once you have completed the 3rd floor, you take on the boss!\nThe boss battle works like a combat encounter, but with multiple rounds. Unlike a regular encounter, a boss has health just like a hero, and it will take a minimum of 2 rounds to defeat any Boss.\nLike any good roguelike, One Deck Dungeon will be a new challenge every time. Just shuffle the deck, and set off on your next adventure!\nStreaming Schedule:\nJoin us on our Twitch channel every Wednesday at 1 pm Eastern during the campaign to watch One Deck Dungeon come to digital before your very eyes!\nWednesday November 8th, 1 pm ET - Coding the Rules Engine with Jean-Marc\nWednesday November 15th, 1 pm ET - Creating the UI in Unity with John \nWednesday November 22nd, 1 pm ET - Q+A with Chris from Asmadi and animation with Jennifer\nWednesday November 29th, 1 pm ET - Making the engine talk to the UI with Jean-Marc and John\nFriday December 1st, 12:30 pm ET - Campaign end countdown stream!\nThe first retail release of One Deck Dungeon will be $10 (USD) and will include all the content from the base tabletop game. The rules and card effects will be carefully adapted and thoroughly tested by expert players, including the designer, Chris Cieslik.\nIncludes 5 heroes, 5 dungeons, and 44 encounter cards\nSolo play with 1 or 2 heroes\nLocal co-op play with 2 heroes\nCampaign mode allows you to build up a hero\u2019s power over multiple plays\nChoose your hero & dungeon, or face a randomized challenge\nLearn the game while you play with an interactive tutorial\nOriginal music for each dungeon by Beatscribe (some tracks adapted from the tabletop soundtrack, others brand new)\nCompatible with Windows, macOS and Linux (system requirements)\nSteam Achievements\nSteam Cloud Saves\n             Item And Delivery Details:\nOne Deck Dungeon for Steam - This item will be delivered as a Steam Product Key to be redeemed via the Steam Store.\nThe Treasure Chest - This item will be delivered as a Steam Product Key to be redeemed via the Steam Store.\nSteam Early Access - Details on playing the game early will be delivered via BackerKit to Backers at levels that include Steam Early Access.\nOne Deck Dungeon Digital Lore Book - This item is a Digital Book designed by Asmadi Games with information about all the monsters in One Deck Dungeon. It will be delivered via BackerKit.\nJoin the Beta Team - Backers who join the beta team will be contacted via the email provided to Kickstarter once the campaign closes with more details. \nOne Deck Dungeon will be available on iPad and Android tablets 1 month after 1.0 launches on Steam.\nWhile we cannot offer keys directly for mobile versions of One Deck Dungeon (See the FAQ), we really want mobile players to be able to participate in the campaign. The Mobile Dungeon backer level is $1 and officially registers your desire to see One Deck Dungeon come to mobile. Your name will be listed in a special section of the credits dedicated to the mobile backers.\nBut there's a better reason to back at that level! For every registered mobile backer, we will release One Deck Dungeon for tablets 1 hour earlier. There are 720 hours in a month, so if 720 people back it at this level, tablet support will launch day and date with One Deck Dungeon for Steam.\nFor more info, check out Update #6 and watch this space to see how many Mobile Backers we have!\nAdd-Ons\nWe will be using BackerKit to manage pledges once the campaign closes. This allows you to add money to your pledge to get additional items. See below for the add-ons available for this campaign.\n    Our initial goal for this project is $20,000 which will cover the rest of the development budget for a 1.0 Steam launch. However, the more money we can raise, the better we can make it! There is additional content, more features and even a full expansion pack that we would also like to bring to the game. That\u2019s where you come in! Help spread the word because the more people we take with us into the dungeon, the more we can do! \nSome of the stretch goals add features that enhance every copy of One Deck Dungeon. But others are a little different. Anyone backing at the Dungeon Collector level or above will also receive the Treasure Chest. \n  What is the Treasure Chest? It\u2019s a place to store your loot of course! It starts with a copy of the digital soundtrack: a $5 value. As we strive to push past our initial goal, we hope to achieve stretch goals that add more loot to the Treasure Chest. \nEvery time we achieve a Loot Stretch Goal, it will go into your Treasure Chest, making the chest more valuable over time. The current contents of the Treasure Chest are below:\nSoundtrack for One Deck Dungeon Digital featuring original music by Beatscribe - $5 value\nPhoenix's Den - $1 Value (when released)\nFanatic - $1 Value (when released)\nCaliana Asmadi - $1 Value (when released)\nThe Witch - $1 Value (when released)\nSmoldering Tunnels - $1 Value (when released)\nTotal value = $10\nThe items in the Treasure Chest will be sold separately after launch - none of them are Kickstarter exclusive.\nForest of Shadows\nThere is one other Special Stretch Goal: the Forest of Shadows Expansion. Forest of Shadows is huge and actually doubles the amount of content in the game, while adding some new mechanics! If we raise enough money to fund the development of Forest of Shadows, we will offer the ability to add a copy of the expansion to your pledge for $10.\n    Watch this space for more info about Stretch Goals and Loot as funding progresses!\nSocial Sharing Goals\nThere's lots of new content coming if we can keep funding past our goal. Those are some lofty numbers so we\u2019re going to need your help to make it happen. In support of that, today we are also announcing we will have some social sharing goals. The first goal is:\n500 shares/retweets - A free batch of One Deck Dungeon wallpapers will be released. Achieved! Check out Update #5 for your free wallpapers.\n750 shares/retweets - We revealed the Witch Hero stretch goal.\n1000 shares/retweets - We revealed the Hellhound Boss, master of the Smoldering Tunnels stretch goal.\nHow can you help spread the word?\nHere's some Avatars to show your One Deck Dungeon love.

During the game, players will use their action pool to move around the evocative maps, investigate mysteries, interact with their environment, and unleash powerful attacks and abilities unique to each character. Once selected, however, these abilities will be unavailable until that character\u2019s action pool has emptied \u2014 a process that becomes more challenging as that character gains fear.\nStory maps for Chapters 1 & 2 - Click to enlarge\n  Players live the adventure of Legends of Sleepy Hollow over eight chapters filled with mystery, suspense, and a deeply rich story. Each chapter is kept separate from the others so players will discover the secrets of Sleepy Hollow as they play. There are seven distinct maps in the game and each chapter unfolds and plays different than the last, so playing Legends of Sleepy Hollow feels much like playing eight different board games!\nNow that we've achieved our base funding goal we will be able to publish Legends of Sleepy Hollow at the quality that we all have come to expect. The base game of Legends of Sleepy Hollow is priced according to our initial funding goal; if we are able to exceed that then we can afford to upgrade some game components and add in a lot of other really cool stuff, like a stand-alone scenario and more Chapter game mats!\nThe mats will introduce the Heroic and Legendary difficulty levels so that players who have completed the game can try again with beastlier baddies and special conditions! The mats will be produced at the same factory as the base game, and on the same stock as the base game Standard mats. We've now unlocked enough of them so we will produce a whole mini-expansion that Kickstarter backers will get for free!\nBackers at the \"Defender of Sleepy Hollow\" pledge level receive the core game of Legends of Sleepy Hollow, complete with 39 custom sculpted miniatures, nearly 200 cards, dozens of wooden tokens, premium player boards and maps, and more! Backers also receive the stand-alone game Lost in the Woods, which tells the prelude to the Legends of Sleepy Hollow story. Finally, backers at this level receive the Kickstarter set of promotional Hero Totem cards, and all applicable stretch goals!\n  Backers at the \"Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" pledge level receive all of the \"Defender of Sleepy Hollow\" rewards, as well as a special hardcover book, American Gothic: The Art of Legends of Sleepy Hollow, filled with over 50 glossy, full-color pages of awesome art! Inside this book you'll find a ton of behind-the-scenes information on the art production process, including preliminary sketches and final pieces for the Heroes, Foes, miniatures and more. Also, American Gothic will include the original short story by Washington Irving with special illustrations!\n      Three days after the disappearance of Ichabod Crane, four Tarry Town residents with strange ties to the supernatural venture into an ever-darkening Sleepy Hollow to uncover its mysteries.\nAs our story begins, the townsfolk of Sleepy Hollow have grown increasingly frightened by tales of dark creatures and ghouls haunting the hillsides. Some of the newer residents scoffed, calling it myth and superstition, but older settlers felt that something was out there lurking. Elijah Kappel could feel it, and he knew the elders were wise; he'd spent the past decade studying the old ways and customs, and could now interpret the hushed whispers of Old World folklore.\nElijah feared that Ichabod's disappearance was only the beginning of something sinister. He knew that even if it was old Brom Bones cavorting around the forest on horseback, his head tucked into his vest, that Elijah might need more than his faith and a trusty walking staff to confront such headstrong opposition. What he needed was someone more imposing than the town bully - perhaps someone who walked softly and carried a big shovel...\n  The Legends of Sleepy Hollow is an adventure game for 1 to 4 players featuring cooperative tactical missions and some \"legacy\" elements.\nChapter 1 set-up - Click to enlarge\n  Watch our rules video for an overview of gameplay:\nOr download our \"print and play\" version of Chapter 1, and try it out for yourself! Just be careful - there are SPOILERS! Please read the file marked READ_THIS_FIRST_Seriously before you look at anything else.\nIf you don't mind spoilers and you just want to see how Chapter 1 of the story plays out, check out our official playthrough:\n  Legends of Sleepy Hollow is a game of mystery and secrets, so many of you may wonder if the game is replayable after completing the game and revealing the story. The answer to that is a resounding YES. While players who have experienced the full story will know the surprise twists throughout the game, each Chapter is designed to be a variable experience each time you play. \nFor instance, during set-up in Chapter 1 the Discovery tokens are randomized so players may find the journals in different places each game. Each Chapter's game mat also has variable conditions such as unpredictable creature spawns, or random event actions.\nFinally, we have created advanced \"Heroic\" (hard) and \"Legendary\" (very hard) versions of each map! We will be offering PDFs of those maps after the game is produced, and sending professionally printed hard copies to each backer for free if we unlock those stretch goals!\nLegends of Sleepy Hollow comes with 7 different Chapter game maps, custom screen-printed dice, thick, layered player boards, tons of cards, 39 gorgeous miniatures, and more! Here\u2019s a complete run-down:\n16 thick, interlocking punchboard map tiles \n4 sculpted plastic Hero miniatures \n10 sculpted plastic Gobkins \n10 sculpted plastic Schrikroots \n15 sculpted plastic other miniatures (shhhh, it\u2019s a secret!)\n Over 140 Euro mini-sized cards with linen finish (for the Legends story deck, character Skills, Skill upgrades, Foe cards, more)\n Over 50 bridge-sized cards with linen finish (character equipment and proficiency upgrade cards) \n4 thick, layered player mats with wells for Action/Fear tokens and equipment/proficiency upgrade cards \n20 wooden Action tokens \n25 custom wooden Fear tokens \n6 custom screen-printed dice \n1 regular six-sided die \n40 thick punchboard Damage rings (attach to bottom of the miniature bases to track damage) \n12-page full color glossy rulebook \n24-page Storybook with thick card stock pages (contains Chapter details, story elements, and game mats) \n1 amazing box - check it out!\nAs a story-driven game, theme and atmosphere are key elements in the experience of playing Legends of Sleepy Hollow. We want you to feel as though you're a part of the world from the moment you pull the box off the shelf. We created this box to replicate an 1800s Dutch-style dresser chest, but with the unique whimsy and beauty that Abigail's art brings to the game. It's as if this relic was lifted directly from the in-game world to your game table. The box lid lifts open to reveal the game contents inside - just as if you were in the game unlocking Ichabod's chest to see what mysteries it holds. The box lid hinges with support from ribbons connecting the inside of the lid to the base. Double-walled interior elements make the box extra sturdy and create a smooth, tight seal when the lid is dropped down. We even included artistic details such as hinges and a front lock!\nSamples of Legend deck, Foes, and starting Hero Skills - Click to enlarge\n  Legends of Sleepy Hollow will have more awesome features inside the box - and we can't even show you all of them... that'd spoil the story and half the fun!\nFirst up, the game will include 39 highly-detailed miniatures designed by Francesco Orr\u00fa and based on character artist Abigail Larsen's concepts. You can check out the four main Hero sculpts below, and get a closer look at the Gobkins and Schrikroots that will be battling our heroes - at least in Chapter 1!\nHero mini samples - click to enlarge\n            Each Hero and Foe miniature has a punchboard ring that attaches to the bottom of the figure and is secured by a plastic base. Tracking health is as simple as turning the ring to the appropriate amount. Some Foes may have special damage track rings that activate abilities - but you'll have to wait and find that out on your own!\nAnother great feature is the Hero player boards. These are made of layered punchboard with recessed wells for Action/Fear tokens, equipment and weapon proficiency upgrades, and a raised surface with room to tuck Skill and Item cards underneath!\n   All backers of Legends of Sleepy Hollow will get some awesome extras!\nFirst off, backers at both pledge levels will also receive the fully-produced solo card game Lost in the Woods, designed by Robert Johnson! The game will retail for $9.95 after the campaign, but it will be sent for free to all backers!\nLost in the Woods is set on the eve of Ichabod Crane's fateful ride home at the end of the original story of Legend of Sleepy Hollow. Players must guide Ichabod from the Van Tassel mansion through the forest to the covered bridge before time runs out and the Headless Horseman chases him down. Players will need to push their luck, avoid frights, and keep their wits to get Ichabod safely home!\nIf you'd like to try Lost in the Woods yourself, you can download the print-and-play files right here!\nHere's an overview of how Lost in the Woods plays!\nNext, every backer will receive a set of personal Totem cards that will not be available in the retail version of Legends of Sleepy Hollow. \nPromotional personal Totem cards - Click to enlarge\n  If the players wish, each character may start the game with their personal Totem card in Inventory. The card may be played from Inventory at any time to resuscitate the character if they have been incapacitated, returning them to full Health and with 2 Fear on the next turn. These cards are useful for lowering the difficulty of the game for more casual groups, or for when things get really heated around Chapter 4!\nKevin and Melissa Delp of Tantrum House took a look at Legends of Sleepy Hollow, and they loved it!\nBeasts of War plays the first chapter of Legends of Sleepy Hollow in Legendary mode!

With its goth horror storytelling and the tension created by the game\u2019s turns, your group will soon be overwhelmed by creatures who move with zombie-like relentlessness. You may not complete your quest on your first attempt, but like any good game, you\u2019ll be quick to try again.\" - Ruel Gaviola, Geek & Sundry \n\"The Legend is real! Story-based gameplay and replayability combine into one mythical gaming experience in the Legends of Sleepy Hollow. Your gaming table will thank you for this one... it definitely earned a spot on my game shelf!\" - Becca Kaufeld, Game Trade Magazine\nHaving played Chapter 1: \u201cAsymmetrical powers? A story to uncover? Secret envelopes to open? And a dude dropping baddies with a shovel!?! What's there not to be excited about???\" - Rob and Christina Rouse, Blue Peg Pink Peg podcast\n\"If you like classic horror, if you like intrigue, and if you have been looking for a well-done campaign game that doesn\u2019t pull any punches and keeps you engaged throughout the entire story, then you want to go look at their Kickstarter page and back it.\" - Marti Wormuth, Open Seat Gaming\n\"When I played solo, however, the game felt like a turn-based tactical video game, such as Final Fantasy Tactics or Fire Emblem, where I was the tactician, in control of the actions of all of the heroes. Despite controlling multiple characters, playing Legends of Sleepy Hollow solo gave me a similar feeling that I had playing Arkham Horror: The Card Game, and I feel it will likely appeal to those that play AH:CG solo for its story-driven, exploratory horror experience.\" - Eric Buscemi, The Cardboard Hoard\n\"I won't spoil the events that take place after completing the team's objective, but if it's anything close to the events of the other seven missions, I expect Legends of Sleepy Hollow will provide ample opportunities for twists and exciting storytelling. Another thing driving story and replayability is once a mission is accomplished, players can choose an additional skill or upgrade their equipment to progress their character and make them more valuable for future missions. I love this inclusion, and I think it will add a lot to keep players engaged, ready to test their new skills on new foes.\" - Chris Hecox, Geeks Under Grace \n\"By the end of our play through, I was genuinely impressed with how well Sleepy Hollow seems to add new content and challenges, and will continue to do so into later chapters.\" - Wyatt Krause, Sprites + Dice\n\"I like how the players have to make their choices with limits, forcing each player to carefully consider possible outcomes. I also like that you can see doom approaching. This helped me and the rest of the players make better choices, while not ever feeling like the game was going easy on us.\" - Father Geek Approved!\n  More to come!\nFor US and Canadian backers, we are offering free shipping. For Canadians, this also covers import taxes and customs duties.\nUnfortunately, we can't offer the same outside the US and Canada, because it is simply too expensive.

However, based on our recent experiences delivering Kickstarter campaigns, we have come up with what we believe is a realistic timeline for this campaign. It doesn't mean that nothing will go wrong, but it will give you a guideline of what to expect. If anything comes up that causes this timeline to slip, we'll explain it in an update.

Many boardgame projects on Kickstarter have been seriously hampered by art production delays, problems with an overseas factory, missing units, and one shipping snafu after another.\n\nLuckily, we have a few projects under our belt, and have dealt with many of those snags along the way.

Sometimes you have to go back and forth on color samples six times just to get the color right, and even then the color isn't perfect.

(We will provide a link to the rulebook once it has completed its second draft)\nMore Players!\nClubhouse will come with 20 brand new players with new tricks and Traits!\nEquipment Cards\nEach Equipment Card belongs to one of three categories. \u201cTools\u201d are items that a player may use, like bats, balls, or even gum. \u201cGear\u201d describes wearable items, such as jerseys or cleats. Finally, there is \u201cClubhouse\u201d Equipment, which affects every player on your roster.\nBefore a game begins, each team may spend $1000 on Equipment Cards. Beginning with the Away team, each player drafts one card that they can legally equip and subtracts the cost from their budget. The icons at the bottom of the card indicate whether a piece of equipment is usable by a pitcher, a hitter, or both. When both budgets are exhausted, each player sets their roster, allocates their equipment, and gets ready for the first pitch!\nTokens & Shift Abilities\nPeanuts! Getchya peanuts Heeeeere! Clubhouse also introduces two new types of abilities - Token and Shift. When a card with peanut icons is put into play, place the indicated number of Peanut Tokens on it. These tokens can be removed to power abilities, or even used to track the effectiveness of an effect.\nShift is a new way to manipulate a die roll. When a player rolls a number depicted in a Shift arrow, they may change that number as shown by the arrows. For example, a Shift 3 up would let the player change a Natural 3 to a Natural 4, whereas Shift 4 down lets the player make a Natural 4 into a Natural 3.\nEquipped Player Example: There are 2 Balls and 2 Strikes in the pitch count against Dan Martini, when Dan is completely fooled during the Stare Down. The pitcher then throws a B3 Pitch. Dan rolls a 4, and with no red or white abilities would normally swing and miss. However, he can remove a token from Pine Tar (Left Equipment Card) and shift the 4 to a 3, laying off the pitch to take a Ball.\n $30 - Bottom of the 9th Playmat\nThe Bottom of the 9th playmat measures 36 x 24\" and is built for playing all versions of Bottom of the 9th, including full 9 innings! Made of highly durable neoprene, this mat will be the centerpiece of your game table.\n$5 - Season 1 Promo Pack\nThis is the Season 1 Promo pack that was given to backers of the original Bottom of the 9th campaign. It includes 2 Players, a Game Condition card, and the beloved (and wildly popular) Pitcher Meeple.\nReview of Bottom of the 9th, from Tom Vasel of The Dice Tower!\n\"Baseball can be exciting in real life; it's certainly exciting in this game!\" -Tom Vasel, The Dice Tower\nReview of Bottom of the 9th by the Game Boy Geek\nAnother review of Bottom of the 9th by Steve Tower from After Further Review\n\"Bottom of the 9th is a fantastic game that has a really fun solo variant. I play a lot of solo board/card games (Mage Knight, Friday, LOTR, Death Angel, Onirim, and so on) and this happens to be my current favorite. The cards are \"heavy\" and sturdy like a real baseball card, and the playing field is nicely done. Recommend this game for sure! - Fredrick T. Matson \n\"I\u2019ve found my new favorite filler game, and its name is Bottom of the 9th.\" - Mark Meredith\n\"My wife and I will be playing this for years to come. We have already been talking about using the official variants to play full games and have gotten very attached to specific players. I honestly cannot imagine a better baseball game.\" - Sam London\n\u201cBottom of the 9th is the best baseball simulation I have ever played.\u201d - Mike Fitzgerald, veteran designer of Wyvern, Mystery Rummy, Hooyah, and Baseball Highlights: 2045\n\u201cBottom of the 9th is exactly what I wanted it to be - a tense and exciting showdown between pitcher and batter with everything on the line.\u201d - Ben Pinchback, co-designer of Fleet and Eggs & Empires\n\"Love how much tension was crammed into such a small game. The selection of pitch location and then the die roll really had you on edge. I also really enjoyed the nostalgia you incorporated with the layout/design.\" - Dan Halstad, League of Nonsensical Gamers\n\"Bottom of the 9th hit me from out of left field. It's a little game that does a LOT of everything. From the large section of players that have wildly different specials to the tense feeling of a neck and neck ball game, Bottom of the 9th  is one of my go-to games at the start of each game night\". - Jason Tagmire, Buttonshy Games. (Maximum Throwdown, Seven 7s)\nBottom of the 9th is a distinguished alum of the Unpub program - a series of public and private playtest events held each year to help designers present, hone and polish their game designs with the gaming public, as well as board game production professionals.\nFor US and Canadian backers, we are charging a flat $5 for shipping. For Canadians, this also covers import taxes and customs duties. Furthermore, if you back at one of the top two tiers and live in the US or Canada, you will get FREE SHIPPING!\nUnfortunately, we can't offer the same outside the US and Canada, because it is simply too expensive. However, any EU orders will be \"EU Friendly\", in that they will not incur VAT or customs fees on delivery.\nThis means that the shipping charges for this campaign are as follows:\nUS: $5\nCanada: $5\nEU: $29\nOther: $39\nWe know that international shipping is annoyingly expensive; believe us, we are just as annoyed as you are! However, to help offset the shipping costs a bit, we have a work-around. For those of you living outside of the US and Canada, if you have a bunch of friends who want to support this project, just make one group pledge for as many games as you\u2019d like, and you'll all receive every stretch goal! Just send us a PM first letting us know what you are doing so that we can watch for it and help you out.\nFirst off, welcome back baseball fans! The reception for the core game of Bottom of the 9th has been nothing short of phenomenal since our successful campaign last spring, and that has been absolutely awesome. Much thanks to all of you who supported this big little game the first time around on Kickstarter.\nWhen we first started talking about doing a baseball game, a lot of industry insiders mentioned that they weren\u2019t sure it would sell. Traditionally, sports board games have been hit or miss in the market. I knew we had something special from the very first time Darrell and Mike showed the base game concept to me, and it\u2019s wonderful to see it be played and enjoyed by so many of you. You all proved that not only could a sports game be successful, but there was also a huge demand for something like Bottom of the 9th!\nThe base game of Bottom of the 9th already has incredible replay value, but the Clubhouse Expansion boosts that variable to incalculable realms. With a huge host of new players, the addition of Equipment, and the introduction of Tokens and the Shift mechanic, you\u2019ll truly never play the same game twice! I am so proud of the work from Darrell and Mike on this, and I guarantee everyone that backs will be satisfied. So oil up those gloves, take a few practice swings, and claim your seat on the bench in the Clubhouse!\nAll the best,\nChris", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project that involves the production and manufacture of a good to be delivered, there is certainly a real chance for hiccups, delays and more than one or two gremlins gumming up the works along the way. Many boardgame projects on Kickstarter have been seriously hampered by art production delays, problems with an overseas factory, missing units and one shipping snafu after another.\n\nLuckily, we have a few projects under our belt, and have dealt with many of those snafus and gremlins along the way. We have a good working relationship with our overseas manufacturer and have become accustomed to their protocols, communication styles and general idiosyncrasies. We try to plan for all contingencies, and have worked through - and learned from - kinks we may have encountered in our past projects.\n\nWe won't lie - stuff happens. Delays can occur. Sometimes you have to go back and forth on color samples six times just to get the color right, and even then the color isn't perfect. Sometimes even personal life events can blindside you. But what we do promise is that we will hold ourselves to the same high standards we expect from other board game publishers, and we will be completely honest and open with each of you every step of the way.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #36", "update_userinfo": "Playmats Have Been Re-Sent!", "update_content": "Greetings Backers!\nAfter going through *two* new batches of playmats from the manufacturer, we finally got a set that are properly printed and undamaged!

We have discovered that, for some reason, the factory packed the playmats in a strange way that resulted in damages. Specifically, instead of folding them or rolling them from the end, the playmats were folded in the middle before being rolled. Whatever temperature or pressure environment they went through on their way to our warehouse in this configuration resulted in permanent creases to some of the mats.

Deck Building: The Deck Building Game and Unpub: The Unpublished Card Game ran on Kickstarter on April 1st, to huge success. \nWell, we're back with more joke games (which are also real games)! Earlier this year, Greater Than Games ran a competition to find the best real games - which are also jokes - and we were overwhelmed by the response, with more than 150 entries submitted! \nWe narrowed it down to the two best joke games (which are also real games), and are delighted to present you with Time Management: The Time Management Game by Nat Levan (creator of New Bedford, a real game that is not a joke game) and Trick-Taking: The Trick-Taking Game by Bob West and Tovarich Pizann (creators of a real joke game which is both real and a joke).\nAs well as that, we have the new game from Christopher Badell and Peter C. Hayward: Traitor Mechanic: The Traitor Mechanic Game! Totally a joke, but also an amazingly real and fun game!\nNow, for the first time, you have the opportunity to get all three games. They're real - they're jokes - and they're all really great games! \nThe clock is ticking. Your boss is breathing down your neck. Wouldn't it be great if you had just a little more time? Fortunately, you just got a job in the office of Time Management, and so, manipulating time is exactly what you do. How many hours can you get out of an 8-hour work day? Rearrange the office to increase efficiency; utilize workers from the Past, Present and Future; make time to face-time and in time you'll hit the big time! The company is depending on you to save time by saving time! Get it? It's all in a day's work! \nTime Management: The Time Management Game is a 1-4 player tile-laying game of puzzles and patterns. Each player takes turn playing cards as office cubicles, projects to be finished, or actions to rearrange the office, attempting to earn the most hours on the clock by completing simple and complex patterns... all while the other players attempt to disrupt them and finish projects of their own.\nThe game can be played in a number of different ways: with 2 or 3 players, each manager is competing for individual scores. At 4 players it becomes a team game, with two teams of two showing off their management prowess and working together to out-maneuver the opposing team. And the game can be played as a solo game, or with up to 4 players as a co-op in Time Crunch mode; projects have started to stack up at the Office of Time Management, and you have to get them back in order before time runs out!\nCheck it out here!\nAstound your friends! Confuse your enemies! Compete to be the most impressive magic performer in Trick-Taking: The Trick-Taking Game! Over a week of rehearsals, keep a close eye on your rival magicians - if they show off a particularly impressive trick, it's up to you to out-do it... or steal it, if you can't. Build up your collection of pilfered magic, and then blow the audience away at the final performance.\nTrick-Taking: The Trick-Taking Game is a card game for 2-4 players. The game takes place over 7 tricks of 7 cards each, with the winner taking all cards played and adding them to their repertoire. The final trick involves each player using cards that they've won across the course of the game, with the finest performance during the Ultimate Trick being the overall winner. \nEach round, one magician plays a trick for their rivals to emulate. Whoever can perform that style of trick best is the winner. After seven tricks, take the card set aside at the start of the game - it reflects the audience's taste, and ensures that every game is different. Do they want a subtle illusion, or are they after the most magnificent levitation trick the world has ever seen? It's up to you to deliver!\nCheck it out here!\nLife is always busy at Slim's Mechanic Shop. But ever since a rival repair store opened up across town, things have seemed even more chaotic than usual. Simple repairs have started going wrong; instead of new headlights, that old Jeep was sent out with six new belts. The bus with four broken windows was cleaned up and given diamond-studded tires. Is it possible that someone is deliberately throwing a wrench in the works? Could one of your co-workers be... wait for it... a Traitor Mechanic? \nTraitor Mechanic: The Traitor Mechanic Game is a social deduction game (using a traitor mechanic!) for 4-10 players, most of whom are loyal mechanics trying to complete three jobs and save the shop's failing reputation. However, some players just want to see the shop burn - if the auto repair shop ever runs out of money, the traitors win. Each round the boss chooses a job for everyone to work on, and players can either contribute parts or remove another player's efforts. If the job requirements aren't met, the shop loses money and the traitor (or traitors) gets closer to victory. \nThe game scales based on the number of players - when playing with fewer mechanics, the traitor makes more of a difference when contributing to each job... but they're easier to find. In a large game, the traitors can blend in easier, but their chances at sabotaging a fix is much slimmer. It's up to you to unmask the traitor before they bankrupt the shop... or blend in seamlessly if you've been hired to bring the place down!\nCheck it out here!\nFor each game you back in this campaign, you'll receive promos - cards which change up the gameplay and won't be available in the retail version of the game!\nFor Time Management: The Time Management Game, you'll get a brand-new cubicle: the Department of Company Time Or Relativity (or \"D.O.C.T.O.R.\" for short). This new cubicle acts as a wild-card, and - of course - it's bigger on the inside! It can be used to complete any project, but messing with the stream of time has consequences: any projects completed this way score you 1 fewer hour.\n---\nTrick-Taking: The Trick-Taking Game will come with a pack of SEVEN promo cards + instructions on how to use them: the \"New Tricks\" promo pack! There are new magicians on the block, and they've brought some new magic! When playing with the promo cards, shuffle them into the deck and randomly discard 7 cards. With New Tricks, every game is different!\n---\nFor backing Traitor Mechanic: The Traitor Mechanic Game, you'll have a brand new job available to you: an Alien Spaceship, with very specific requirements. Can you help this intergalactic visitor get home again? Just shuffle the card into the job deck, and hope that you can fix a vehicle which is truly out of this world!\nAll three of these games will offer the same hallmark replay value as other Dice Hate Me titles from Greater Than Games, with thick punchboard bits, high-quality components, and sturdy 310 gsm cards. Here's a list of what you'll find inside each box:\nTime Management: The Time Management Game\n54 square cards (like the ones used in Deck Building: The Deck Building Game)\n3 clock-shaped score tokens \n1 score track \n1 rulebook\n1 \"Rabbit\" sized box\nTrick-Taking: The Trick-Taking Game\n50 trick cards\n1 double-sided hat card\n Reminder cards\n1 rulebook\n1 \"Rabbit\" sized box\nTraitor Mechanic: The Traitor Mechanic Game\n65 Part cards (including 12 Expensive part cards and 5 \"Service With A Smile\" cards)\n15 Job cards\n10 Role cards (8 Mechanics, 2 Traitors)\n1 large \"Boss\" token in the shape of a clipboard\n1 \"On Break\" token\n Money tokens\n1 rulebook\n1 \"Monkey\" sized box\nFor US and Canadian backers, we are charging a flat $5 for shipping. For Canadians, this also covers import taxes and customs duties. Furthermore, if you back at the $37 level and live in the US or Canada, you will get FREE SHIPPING! \nUnfortunately, we can't offer the same outside the US and Canada, because it is simply too expensive. However, any EU orders will be \"EU Friendly\", in that they will not incur VAT or customs fees on delivery. \nThis means that the shipping charges for this campaign are as follows: \nUS: $5 (or $0 for the $37 tier) \nCanada: $5 (or $0 for the $37 tier) \nEU: $19 \nOther: $29\nWe know that international shipping is annoyingly expensive; believe us, we are just as annoyed as you are! However, to help offset the shipping costs a bit, we have a work-around. For those of you living outside of the US and Canada, if you have a bunch of friends who want to support this project, just make one group pledge for as many games as you\u2019d like, and you'll all receive every stretch goal! Just send us a PM first letting us know what you are doing so that we can watch for it and help you out.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are launching a Kickstarter for three games with humorous themes on April Fools Day with only a 1-week funding window. There is a real danger that some people will believe that this Kickstarter campaign is a joke, and that the games are either not real, or just \u201cjoke games\u201d. However, we believe that the entertainment value outweighs that risk. The games *are* humorous, but they are also very real, very fun games, and we hope that everyone enjoys them as much as we enjoyed designing and playing them during the development process!\n\nFurthermore, as with any project that involves the production and manufacture of a good to be delivered, there is certainly a real chance for hiccups, delays and more than one or two gremlins gumming up the works along the way. Many boardgame projects on Kickstarter have been seriously hampered by art production delays, problems with an overseas factory, missing units and one shipping snafu after another.\n\nLuckily, we have a few projects under our belt, and have dealt with many of those snags along the way. We try to plan for all contingencies, and we've been fairly successful with that in our past projects.\n\nWe won't lie - stuff happens. Delays can occur. Sometimes you have to go back and forth on color samples six times just to get the color right, and even then the color isn't perfect. But what we do promise is that we will hold ourselves to the same high standards we expect from other board game publishers and our previous projects, and we will be completely honest and open with each of you every step of the way.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #18", "update_userinfo": "The Final Rewards have Shipped!", "update_content": "As of this morning, all of the outstanding orders for old Metagames (Deck Building, Unpub, BBQ Grill) have shipped!

Petty Experience, where you can be a part of two very special games from one of the greatest game designers of our time!\nWe could include a short biography of the Ion Award-winning T.C. Petty III here but there's really no need. Surely you've heard of his exploits at this point, and even if you haven't, all you really need to know is that his name is often mentioned in the same breath as Alan Moon, Reiner Knizia, Stefan Feld, and Salvador Dali. That should be more than enough to force those fingers over to the \"Pledge\" button.\nDON'T GET EATED\n Don't Get Eated is a social game of survival of the fittest. Players take on the roles of totally cute animals that are tired of the boring life on the farm and want to escape into the world. The only problem is, the world is a dangerous place! In the game, players will work together and against each other to survive in the wilds. Failure to meet the challenge presented each round results in a vicious attack, until only one animal remains standing.\nIn Don't Get Eated, each round will call for players to simultaneously play a numerical card from their hand attempting to survive a certain precarious threat - for example, play over a certain number, play under a certain number, and so on. Every player that plays the same numbered card forms a squad for that round, and their played value is increased by the number of animals on the squad. Any player or squad that does not meet the challenge takes a bite, and they are closer to losing the game. Players may be knocked out (or eated) by taking two bites.\nEated animals are never completely out of the game, though; they become part of Teh Eated who are tired and beaten and really just want to go back to the farm. Teh Eated exist for only one purpose: To moan and whine and annoy the living and make them Eated as well!\nDon't Get Eated is for 5 to 9 players and takes about 30 minutes to play, featuring art by Kwanchai Moriya. Inside the box you'll find 99 Animal cards (9 different animals, 11 cards each), 12 Threat cards, a punchboard Wheel of Doom with plastic spinner, and punchboard Point and Bite tokens. Don't Get Eated will come in the Dice Hate Me Games \"Monkey\"-sized box - the same size as Bottom of the 9th and The Great Heartland Hauling Co. What's this crazy talk? Take a look here for more information on our box sizes and game categories!\nWant to know exactly how to brave the wilds and not get eated? Then check out this video for a survival guide!\nAfter you've checked out the rules, if you want to see what a full game of Don't Get Eated can be like then check out the video playthrough! We've got a full game with six people - and plenty of them get eated. Exciting!\nCLUB ZEN\nEast meets West in Club Zen, a relaxing worker placement game where the goal is to plan out your seven-day working vacation in the most Zen way possible. Manage your work and emotional stress, make new friends, attend exciting events such as Hang-Gliding or Rock Climbing, collect stones for your personal Zen Garden, or take a nap! How will you spend your time at the 5-star resort, Club Zen? The most relaxed or \"zen\" player at the end of their one week stay will be the winner.\nUnlike traditional resource management and worker placement games, Club Zen encourages players to visit the same locations together, many times for an increased benefit for all players involved. Because of this, the game encourages a measure of cooperation and meaningful positive interaction, while still having only one winner. The game is a sandbox of strongly thematic and relaxing environments to explore, with each element tuned to be both strategic and evoke a real sense of immersion.\nClub Zen is for 3 to 5 players and takes about 90 minutes to play, featuring art by Adam Rebottaro. We can get that down to 2 players if we fund high enough; check out the stretch goals below! \nInside the box you'll find a high-quality resort game board, 35 Emotional Stress cards, 10 Work Stress cards, 35 Friend cards, 30 Event cards, 5 thick punchboard player \"Hotel Room\" boards, punchboard player score track, 5 player aid cards, 15 player placement tokens (1 each of morning, noon, and night for up to 5 players), 50 wooden Work Stress cubes, 50 wooden Emotional Stress cubes, and several punchboard Zen Rock, Karma, and Money tokens. Club Zen will come in the Dice Hate Me Games \"Dragon\"-sized box - our biggest box and the first of its kind! What's this crazy talk? Take a look here for more information on our box sizes and game categories!\nWanna know how to play Club Zen? Then check out this relaxing tutorial! Just bear in mind that the game in the video is a prototype, and some art and bits aren't final.\nClub Zen is all about the experience in playing. If you'd like to see what that experience might be like, take a look at the video playthrough below with three players. It's your chance to see how Friends work together, the joys of dining with others, and even witness a group Volleyball Tournament!\nThe designs of both Don't Get Eated and Club Zen revolve around the concept of Positive Player Interaction, a core design philosophy that T.C. has developed since his first published games VivaJava: The Coffee Game and VivaJava: The Coffee Game: The Dice Game. If you'd like to know more about why the sweet genius of Positive Player Interaction can make games more fun for everyone, be sure to check out T.C.'s series of blog posts on Designer Ego.\nThrough the glorious joy that is the internets you can download, print, and play Don't Get Eated and Club Zen today! All you need are the files, a printer, some scissors, and some time, and you'll soon have a little piece of T.C. right inside your home.\nDon't Get Eated print-and-play files are here.\nClub Zen print-and-play files are here.\nIf this project funds, we will be able to make two totally awesome games from one of today's seminal designers. By way of thanks, we will be sending backers of each game certain promos not immediately available in retail that will add even more awesomeness to the games!\nDon\u2019t Get Eated\nWhen we absolutely fund - Each backer of Don't Get Eated gets The Mole animal deck (11 new cards used when the game is played with less than 9 players). Incremental stretch goals after that will include:\nPunchboard Animal Markers\nExtra Animal 1 (We'll vote!)\nExtra Animal 2 (We'll vote!)\nAdvanced Threats Pack (things get really dangerous!)\nClub Zen\nWhen we absolutely fund - Each backer of Club Zen gets the Crowdfunding promo pack (a set of special Event and Emotional Stress cards) + 10 extra friends (and you can be one of them, check out the Friends Pledge Level!). Incremental stretch goals after that will include:\nUpgrade track markers to wood\nUpgrade player tokens to wood\nAdd extra bits to upgrade the game for a two-player variant\nIf you add $1,000 to your PIZZA PARTY pledge, then Compounded and Bottom of the 9th designer Darrell Louder will fly out, too! That's three for the price of two and a half!\nGREAT NEWS! For this campaign, we are going to try something new. We are now shipping in enough volume that we think we can manage to pay for free shipping for backers in the US and Canada. That's right, for the first time ever, Greater Than Games is offering free shipping!\nUnfortunately, we can't offer the same outside the US and Canada, because it is simply too expensive. However, any EU orders will be \"EU Friendly\", in that they will not incur VAT or customs fees on delivery.\nThis means that the shipping charges for this campaign are as follows:\nUS: $0\nCanada: $0\nEU: $35\nOther: $50\nWe know that international shipping is annoyingly expensive; believe us, we are just as annoyed as you are! However, to help offset the shipping costs a bit, we have work-arounds. You can add additional copies of Club Zen or Don't Get Eated, including all stretch goals, to your pledge for +$49 or +$19, respectively, (or +$64 for both) and the shipping rates are fixed regardless of the number of games. If you have a bunch of friends who want to support this project, just make one group pledge for as many games as you\u2019d like, and you'll all receive every stretch goal!\n\"I played Club Zen a few Origins ago, and it was the most fun I ever had trying to convince Matt Riddle to come have breakfast with me. (That is legitimately something that happens in this game) The game somehow manages to have a genuine euro-game core while also having surreal and serious negotiations. It's my cup of tea all around, and I'm excited to see it in print. My only regret is that I lost my first game so badly, but that is likely because I spent the whole time trying to get T.C.'s autograph.\" - Scott Almes, decorated designer of the Tiny Epic series of games, Loop, Inc., Best Treehouse Ever, and more\n\"When I first heard about Don't Get Eated, my first thought was to unleash my many, many lawyers on T.C. Then, once I played it, I found a game filled with tough decisions and exciting surprises, with ingenious gameplay for animals banding together or betraying one another. Player elimination is handled in a way that keeps everybody in the game while keeping the tension in every round. Plus, it included a spinner (not seen since the games of our childhood) integrated in a way that made sure that every game was different. I still might sue TC out of existence. But for now I highly recommend Don't Get Eated. It is, without a doubt, the second-best simultaneous-play card game about animal mastication with player elimination by an award-winning game designer.\" Dave Chalker, award-winning designer of Get Bit, Heat, Thief's Market, and more\n\"Club Zen is simply one of my favorite thematic Euro style games of all time. The way the game encourages players to team up to make certain actions better is genius.\" - Ben Pinchback, co-designer of Fleet, Eggs & Empires, Morocco, and more\n\"Club Zen is legitimately different from any other game I have ever played. Mechanically, it is 'just' worker placement but the thematic feel and the way you accomplish your goals both together and alone are clever and fun and completely unique.\" - Matt Riddle, co-designer of Fleet, Eggs & Empires, Morocco, and more\n\u201cWhen we play games, winning or losing doesn\u2019t matter near as much as having a good story to tell when it\u2019s over. Don\u2019t Get Eated is GREAT for that! Now, I\u2019m normally a mild-mannered, nice, honest guy. Reliable and fairly predictable when it comes to being nice and honorable. But I\u2019ll never forget Ben\u2019s face when, after a careful negotiation, I didn\u2019t follow him after all. OMG, the poor guy was CRUSHED! I won that game, it\u2019s true. Later that day, I apologized to Ben for the \u2018betrayal.' Gotta keep him thinking I\u2019m mild-mannered and nice and honorable \u2026 at least until our next game!\u201d - Josh Tempkin, game designer for Tall Tower Games and founder of Table Treasure Games design and playtest group\n\"The only actual way to NOT get eated in the game of life is to purchase Don't Get Eated. It's a social gaming experience truly unlike any other, and I've had the delicious pleasure of playing it several times from inception to publish-ready. I know what you're thinking. 'But, Stephanie, it's not grammatically correct,' and to that I simply say 'You're not grammatical correct. Buy this game.' \" - Stephanie Straw, boardgame internet personality\n\"Like Zen, this game is simple. It is so simple, in fact, that it's difficult to intellectually grasp because human intelligence and wisdom are too limited. I have had the pleasure of experiencing this game firsthand and all I can say is that my eyes are finally open and the world is not the same. At Club Zen, nothing matters save experience. Club Zen is not a system of philosophy, nor of psychology, nor of standard worker placement mechanics and when it tries to explain itself in these terms it ceases to be Club Zen. I highly recommend you embark on this path to enlightenment. As you do, let your unconscious mind and ego melt away (even if TC\u2019s won\u2019t). This is Club Zen.\" - Dan Halstad, League of Nonsensical Gamers\n\"Club Zen doesn't just feel different from any other worker placement, it has an amazingly original theme that really immerses you in its world. I want to visit Club Zen as often as I can!\" - Clyde Wright, gaming legend\n\"Don't Get Eated fits that social game spot where you can be social yet not the center of attention, so there is no feeling of anxiety like you might get in a game like Spyfall or Resistance.\" - Dan Patriss, The Geek All-Stars\n\"Club Zen, like the designer himself, is equal parts quirk, pretentiousness, and cool calculation. T.C. Petty III specializes in positive player interaction and palpable-but-tongue-in-cheek thematic consonance, and Club Zen has both of those in spades. Or diamonds. Hearts at a minimum. My favorite bits are the details I told him to add... those are clearly the best parts of the game. That and the quotes on the Emotional Stress cards, I hope they remain. If you like euro-style worker placement games with uncommon themes, then Club Zen is well worth the hours you'll spend playing it instead of taking an actual meditative vacation. And it's much cheaper to boot. Also (and this is legitimately true), my fiance wanted to play it again and again. I'm a little disappointed in the lack of colons (:) in the title, but other than that I think it's safe to say: Playing Club Zen is better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick - for at least 90% of the sharp sticks out there.\" - Seth Jaffee, game developer for Tasty Minstrel Games and designer of Isle of Trains, Eminent Domain, and more\n\"I like (Club Zen). Well, I like it as much as I like 'The Cool Petty'\" - Michael Mindes, owner of Tasty Minstrel Games\n\"Looking forward to upgrading my PnP of this T.C. Petty III joint to Dice Hate Me quality! Excellent party game (Don't Get Eated)\" - Lanier Wexford, some guy on Twitter.\n\"Club Zen is everything you liked about Rococo and fixes everything you didn't like about Rococo.\" - Christopher Badell, designer of Deck Building: The Deck Building Game\n\"Don't Get Eated is a gem of party game design. Everyone who plays games with 6-8 people needs this one.\" - Jay Treat, game designer and playtester extraordinaire\n\"When I first played Club Zen back at Unpub 3, I immediately could tell that it was several years from publishing, and would only make it if bundled into a Kickstarter with several other games. Much like great art, Club Zen will only reach full appreciation among the tabletop community once the designer has passed away. I expect this to give Pandemic Legacy: Season 12 a run for its money\" - Matt Morgan, internet guy\n\"Don't Get Eated is a game where you work together. I don't like working together. So ya. But I am prolly wrong and I am sure it's good cause T.C. is smart.\" - Matt Riddle\n\"Club Zen perfectly shows that even though you may go on vacation, the stress from real life doesn't. I've never had a game make me seriously consider if I should I go SCUBA diving or finish filing my TPS reports and I assume I never will again. It has a lot of interesting choices and ways to win... but only if you can just sit back and relax.\" - Derrick Vidal, game designer for Baked Fresh Daily Games\n\"My first exposure to Club Zen was at the majestic, and entirely un-relaxing, whirlwind-of-an-event: Unpub 5. I heard that Ion Award Winner TC Petty III had created a worker placement game, but with a 'TC Twist,' and I knew that I had to play it. I abandoned my table, and my responsibilities, to sit down to one of the most engaging, brain churning, and meditative game sessions that little bits of cardboard could offer. The game and I just \"get\" each other. This is why I will be getting it as soon as I possibly can. Club Zen has quickly become my favorite worker placement game, ne\u00e9 experience. Everyone should back this game!\" Greg Miller, game designer for Baked Fresh Daily Games\n\"Don't Get Eated is Resistance fixed. No, better than that, it's Secret Hitler fixed. No better than that still - neither of those games include the brilliance or sophistication of a spinner. Social games with never be the same in your life!\" - Darrell Louder, designer of Compounded and Bottom of the 9th\nI'm not sure there's much I can say about T.C. Petty III that T.C. hasn't already said about himself in many, many forums, podcasts, convention panels, blog posts, and public orations in town squares. But I will say that T.C. really is one of our national board game treasures, and he can turn an ordinary game into an exceptional one. I've been a huge fan since the early years - heck, the second game ever produced from Dice Hate Me Games was VivaJava, and it still remains my personal favorite in our library (just don't tell the other designers - they're tired of hearing it from T.C.). \nTruth be told, Don't Get Eated and Club Zen really are exceptional games that have been in development for over three years. But as good as T.C. is we can't make these modern classics a reality without your help. So go ahead, grab one of those pizza party pledges - after all, you deserve it.\nAll the best,\nChris", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project that involves the production and manufacture of a good to be delivered, there is certainly a real chance for hiccups, delays and more than one or two gremlins gumming up the works along the way. Many boardgame projects on Kickstarter have been seriously hampered by art production delays, problems with an overseas factory, missing units and one shipping snafu after another.\n\nLuckily, we have a few projects under our belt, and have dealt with many of those snags along the way. We try to plan for all contingencies, and we've been fairly successful with that in our past projects.\n\nWe won't lie - stuff happens. Delays can occur. Sometimes you have to go back and forth on color samples six times just to get the color right, and even then the color isn't perfect. But what we do promise is that we will hold ourselves to the same high standards we expect from other board game publishers and our previous projects, and we will be completely honest and open with each of you every step of the way.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Dice Hate Me Games\n20 created \u00b7 2 backed\nDice Hate Me Games, LLC is a division of Greater Than Games, LLC, committed to bringing entertaining, innovative, and challenging games to...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #12", "update_userinfo": "I Won't Back Down", "update_content": "Greetings T.C.

Gather resources to add buildings with new actions, and launch ships to go whaling. Go out longest for the best choice, but wait too long and the whales become harder to catch. And don't forget to pay your crew when ships return! Carefully balance risk management and timing to earn the most points in this medium-weight worker placement and resource management game.\nNew Bedford is a game for 1-4 players, ages 13 and up, and designed by Nat Levan. New Bedford is a distinguished alum of the Unpub program - a series of public and private playtest events held each year to help designers present, hone, and polish their game designs with the gaming public, as well as board game production professionals.\nIf you'd like to know more about the design process behind New Bedford, designer Nat Levan has extensively chronicled the game's development on the Oakleaf Games blog. Nat also sat down with the Dice Hate Me crew on episode 74 of The State of Games podcast to talk about the game; the New Bedford portion begins at the 25 minute mark.\nA bit more detail: Over twelve rounds, players take turns placing their two workers. The town board and whaling board contain basic game actions: Taking goods (food, wood, and brick), selling goods, constructing buildings, docking ships, and launching ships. These actions can be used multiple times per round, with the first player to do so in a round receiving a bonus of more goods or reducing the number of goods paid.\nMost buildings add extra action spaces with new actions, combined actions, and more powerful versions of basic actions. You own whatever you build, with others needing to pay you to use them and you earning points from them at game's end.\nYou need to spend food to send ships whaling, choosing how far out to send them. At the end of the round, ships move closer to shore and whale tokens are drawn randomly. Ships that are farthest out have first chance to pick the valuable sperm whales, but as they move in, others have the opportunity to launch farther out and get a better pick, possibly leaving you with only empty seas. Over the course of the game, whales become more rare and empty seas more common - an historical reflection of the toll that whaling had on the environment. Once a ship reaches shore, a percentage of the profits (the \"lay\") must be paid in order to keep the gathered whales.\nIf you'd like to dive deeper into New Bedford, you can download the print-and-play version of the game right here: (Components and Rules).The PnP includes all the buildings, whales, the town board, the player boards and the whaling board. You'll need to provide bits to represent the wood, food, brick, meeples, ships, and money (cubes, coins, toy boats - whatever you'd like).\nNew Bedford will offer the same hallmark replay value as other Dice Hate Me titles from Greater Than Games, with high-quality components, thick punchboard bits, and lots and lots of wood. Here's a list of what you'll find inside the box:\nBase Game Components\nNew Bedford will come in the Dice Hate Me Games \"Rooster\"-sized box - the same size as Compounded and VivaJava Dice. What's this crazy talk? Take a look here for more information on our box sizes and game categories!\nIn addition, backers at any level may add $6 to their pledge to receive a copy of Nantucket. This is a small, 2-player game with a whaling theme also designed by Nat Levan.\nNantucket takes you to \"The Little Grey Lady of the Sea\" during the early American whaling industry. You need just a few cards and coins to play in whatever port you find yourself. Mix and match two cards to form the modular board. Then use your single action each round to carefully build the town and send out ships. After performing your actions, flip the coins on your ship to catch a whale. Play until the town is fully constructed, supplies run out, or the last whales are taken. Between buildings and earned coins, may the best captain win!\nIt will be available after the campaign for $9.95, but is available to backers of this campaign only for $6, and will not increase your shipping charges. Check out this update for more information, or click here to access the Print and Play!\nIf this project funds, we will be able to make an incredibly fun game. By way of thanks, we will be sending every single backer a copy of the White Whale Promo! This promo pack adds four super-rare items to the whaling bag, including The White Whale, which destroys a ship if caught!\nIn addition to this promo pack, which will be sent to every single backer, we have some additional awesome content that we'll be able to include free of charge to every backer if we exceed our funding goal:\n$25,000 - Funded! All backers also receive the White Whale Promo!\n$30,000 - Two-tone ships unlocked!\n$35,000 - All backers receive the Additional Buildings Mini-Expansion!\n$40,000 - Custom resource shapes unlocked!\n$45,000 - Unlocked!

We've planned stretch goals out through $80,000, which will be the final stretch goal point for this campaign. Thanks for supporting New Bedford!\nAs with previous campaigns, we unfortunately have to charge shipping on this campaign, but are continuing to work to minimize the shipping cost to you. Shipping on this campaign is priced as follows:\nUS: $9\nCanada: $14\nEU: $35\nOther: $50\nFor customers in Canada, the EU, and Australia, this includes customs duties and import taxes, but it does not for other countries.\nWe know that international shipping is annoyingly expensive; believe us, we are just as annoyed as you are! However, to help offset the shipping costs a bit, we have work-arounds.You can add additional copies of New Bedford, including all stretch goals, to your pledge for +$29, and the shipping rates are fixed regardless of the number of games. If you have a bunch of friends who want to support this project, just make one group pledge for as many games as you\u2019d like, and you'll all receive every stretch goal!\nBy 1848, the city of New Bedford in Massachusetts had become the most powerful city in the whaling industry and was soon to be one of the richest cities in the world. Whale oil exported from New Bedford helped to fuel the world and, eventually, usher in the Industrial Revolution; in time, it would be referred to as \"the city that lit the world\".\nIn 1841, Herman Melville sailed out from New Bedford working as a whaler on the ship Acushnet. His experiences in whaling eventually lead him to write the novel Moby-Dick. It was published in 1851, and New Bedford is the initial setting for the novel.\nHistoric New Bedford\n\"The theme is wonderful and absolutely fitting. It\u2019s well integrated and unique... The bottom line... New Bedford is a town worth visiting.\" - John Moller, Cartrunk Entertainment (click to read his full review)\n\u201cBefore I even had the chance to crack open New Bedford, the game caught my attention because someone had mentioned that it was like a more concise and elegant version of Le Havre. While I\u2019ll agree that the two games do share some similarities, saying that New Bedford is essentially Le Havre light does it a great disservice. New Bedford offers its own unique experience that feels fresh and not borrowed.\u201d - Kyle Chivers, Euro Board Game Blog (click to read his full review)\n\"New Bedford does a lot of things right - but the best thing about the game is that it is one of those games that is easy to both learn and teach, but will surprise you with its depth after you dive in for subsequent plays.\" - James Flemming, Board Game Reviews by Josh (click to read his full review)\n\u201cBeyond the theme, I like New Bedford for several game-play reasons. I am reminded of Puerto Rico from the standpoint that players can score through the staple process of whaling as well as from buying buildings to augment the town of New Bedford. Likewise, New Bedford includes the worker-placement-building quality of Le Havre with buildings that facilitate collecting materials, constructing buildings, or sending out whaling ships. I actually find New Bedford cleaner and more elegant than Le Havre.\u201d - Paul Owen, Man Overboard (click to see more comments)\n\u201cSolid worker placement game. The two different elements to the game, building the village and the whaling, complement each other nicely. I got to play this at Grand Con at an Unpub event. Multiple victory paths and some interesting combos can be made with some of the village tiles. Can't wait for this one to come out.\u201d - David Taylor, To the Table\n\u201cWhen I played New Bedford when it was printer paper and glue I fell in love with the concept and game play. Now that I see the final product the game has been brought to life in a whole new way and still sits in my top five to play as two player with my hubby or with a group of friends!\u201d - Lesley Louder, The Chalkboard Gamer\n\"New Bedford has all the strategizing of a game like Agricola without the stress. It wonderfully meshes worker placement, town building, and tile drawing in such a way that it plays fast without comprising any depth.\u201d - Scott King, game photographer and blogger\n\"Such a smooth, engaging gaming experience. New Bedford is a great low-cost-of-entry euro that has enough game for game night, but is still completely accessible for my family.\" - Matt Riddle, co-designer of Fleet and person of no consequence\n\"When I played this game at an Unpub over a year ago, I was unsure if I would like a game about whaling. That was quickly proven wrong, and I told Nat when he was done with New Bedford I wanted a copy of it.\" - Derrick Vidal, Baked Fresh Daily Games\n\u201cFrom the moment I sat down with New Bedford and took my first turn, I knew that I was seeing something special. While I\u2019ve had the privilege of playing several games in the Unpub program, only a few of them make me want to drop money on the spot. New Bedford was exactly that. The cool thing is, I\u2019ve only seen it get even better! Take my money now!\u201d - Greg Miller, Baked Fresh Daily Games\n\"One of those rare occasions where everyone at the table was lost in the world and loving every minute.\" - Josh Mills, game designer\nNew Bedford\u2019s design was influenced by a time when whaling was a part of daily life - and that eventually lead to a modern crisis for many species of whales. To make it clear, we don\u2019t condone modern whaling. But we think that the history of New Bedford and the whaling industry is an important subject. Just like our chemistry game, Compounded, we believe that games designed for entertainment can also be educational - and, in this case, foster discussion about a controversial topic. For more information on modern whaling and conservation efforts, please check out this overview from the World Wildlife Fund.\nNat & Chris\nWe knew that the theme of historic whaling could be considered a bit controversial by some, but we believe in New Bedford and in the theme. As Herman Melville once wrote about his novel, Moby-Dick, \"To produce a mighty book, you must choose a mighty theme.\" We think New Bedford is a mighty little game, and we are proud to present it to all of you. Thanks, as always, for the continued support for Dice Hate Me Games from our Kickstarter family. You continue to amaze and humble us.\nLet's keep sailing,\nChris & Nat", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBefore the merger of Dice Hate Me Games and Greater Than Games, a previous version of New Bedford was on Kickstarter, only to see its campaign canceled. There were many reasons for the decision to cancel the project at that time, which was discussed on episode 76 of the State of Games podcast. However, we believe that the most important reason was to make the game much better. We believe that we have done so, and are thrilled to re-launch the game at this time. However, there is a risk that people will not be willing to take another look at this fantastic game.\n\nAdditionally, as with any project that involves the production and manufacture of a good to be delivered, there is certainly a real chance for hiccups, delays and more than one or two gremlins gumming up the works along the way. Many boardgame projects on Kickstarter have been seriously hampered by art production delays, problems with an overseas factory, missing units and one shipping snafu after another.\n\nLuckily, we have a few projects under our belt, and have dealt with many of those snags along the way. We try to plan for all contingencies, and we've been fairly successful with that in our past projects.\n\nWe won't lie - stuff happens. Delays can occur. Sometimes you have to go back and forth on color samples six times just to get the color right, and even then the color isn't perfect. But what we do promise is that we will hold ourselves to the same high standards we expect from other board game publishers and our previous projects, and we will be completely honest and open with each of you every step of the way.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #38", "update_userinfo": "Errata Tiles", "update_content": "Greetings Backers!\nBy now, all of you *should* have gotten your errata tiles if you selected that option in BackerKit.

Obviously, this shouldn\u2019t happen.\nAfter a Kickstarter campaign has funded, a majority of monitoring and communication is handed over to our Community Manager, Craig McRoberts. Craig is fantastic at trying to keep everyone in the know and keeping up with conversations via email, BGG, and several other forums. Craig also helps to manage our booths and volunteers at conventions, so GenCon and PAX prep and operations ate up most of his available time for a whole month. We should have been more proactive in creating redundancies for communication during this period, as well as checking to make sure that replacement and order requests were being monitored for the warehouse.

SUNDAY! SUNDAY! Monster Truck Mayhem is invading the SuperMegaDome! Brought to you by Ridback Pub, 101 The Animal, and Big Al\u2019s Sound Emporium, this thrill show spectacular will BLOW YOUR MIND! All your favorite trucks and more will be there\u2026 AND SO SHOULD YOU! Car crushing, mud sliding, bus jumping, and general mayhem for only $39! Less than FORTY BUCKS gets you the whole seat... but you will only need the edge Edge EDGE!\nMonster Truck Mayhem is a real-time dice-rolling racing game, designed by Ben Pinchback & Matt Riddle, creators of the award-winning games Fleet and Eggs & Empires. Players simultaneously roll their dice to race around the SuperMegaDome track, and the winner is the first player to cross the finish line!\nPlayers use custom dice to move 1, 2, or 3 spaces at a time. The numbers, \u201cTire\u201d and \u201cBoost\u201d die faces are used to navigate course obstacles like the Car Crush, Bus Jump, Death Chasm, and more! Three \u201cBoost\u201d is an instant movement bonus. Three \u201cTires\u201d causes another player to spin out!\nCrush obstacles AND the competition, and be the first monster truck to cross the finish line to take home the SuperMegaTrophy!\nMonster Truck Mayhem will offer the same hallmark quality as the other Dice Hate Me titles from Greater Than Games, with fine components, thick punchboard bits, and lots of replay value. The projected MSRP for Monster Truck Mayhem is set at $40.\nHere's a list of what you'll find inside the base game box:\n6 thick punchboard Monster Trucks, with stands\n6 punchboard Monster Truck player boards, with special Mayhem Bonus abilities\n6 double-sided, interlocking track boards for variable set-up\n15 custom-molded Racing Dice\n1 Special Truckdor custom-molded Fire Die\n4 Drive Angry! punchboard tokens for Big D\n3 Insanity Roll! punchboard tokens for Cthulhu Crusher\n8 Sunday! Sunday! Sunday! cards\n6 blank Sunday! Sunday! Sunday! cards for adding your own special announcements\n2 Sunday! Sunday! Sunday! punchboard pieces for variable set-up\n2 1-2-3 Burst Wall punchboard pieces for variable set-up\nFull-color rulebook\nMonster Truck Mayhem will be the first official title to come in the Dice Hate Me Games \"Dragon\"-sized box - a box that's almost a foot square and three inches deep, so it's truly monster-sized!  What's this crazy talk about box sizes anyway? Take a look here for more information on our box sizes and game categories!\nThe Monster Rally expansion pack will be sold separately in retail stores, but will be included for free with every Monster Truck Mayhem pledge (a $15 value). This expansion pack will provide rules and a points system for playing multi-lap races and campaigns where players can purchase awesome upgrades for their trucks! \nHere's what's included in the expansion:\n1 custom-molded green Hood Scoop Die \n1 custom-molded purple Sweet Spoiler Die \n2 punchboard Icy Track tokens \n2 punchboard Smokescreen tokens\n12 Monster Upgrade cards\n2 thick punchboard Monster Trucks, with stands\n2 punchboard Monster Truck player boards, with special Mayhem Bonus abilities\nRules sheet for playing rally and campaign races, with points system for purchasing upgrades between races\nWe'll be revealing more details on the extras included in the Monster Rally expansion as the campaign goes on!\nAbove is a shot of the prototype base game with beginner track boards in action, which is very close to what the final production copy will look like!\nBig D is the flagship truck for the Dice Hate Me Monster Racers team. Four times during a race, Big D can activate the Drive Angry! Mayhem Bonus and move forward three spaces without rolling the dice. As any good Dice Hate Me fan knows, if there's a chance not to rely on the dice for a good result it's probably in their best interest!\nCthulhu Crusher brings a special colour out of space to the SuperMegaDome, filling his opponents' hearts with sheer terror! Cthulhu Crusher can make three other racers go insane during a race, forcing an opponent to roll their dice and move backward double their highest die roll. The Insanity Roll is a great way to keep the race leader in check, and help guarantee that this racer crushes the competition!\nThis wicked spirit of war from Norse mythology is one of the fastest racers in the SuperMegaDome! Whenever Valkyrie rolls three \"Boosts\" on her Racing Dice, she can choose to speed forward 5 spaces. The other trucks better watch their rearviews, as just when it seems Valkyrie may be left in the dust she's suddenly a quarter track ahead! \nTruckdor is here to burninate EVERYTHING!!! This fierce dragon uses a special Fire Die with a wild side that can be used as a 1, 2, 3, Tire, or Boost. With Truckdor's flames heating up the SuperMegaDome, the other trucks are TOAST!\nThe tracks of the SuperMegaDome can often be treacherous, with incredibly muddy slick spots that can keep trucks tied up without traction for a long, long time. Cap'n Crabby only laughs a mighty YAR HAR at the slick spots since he gets traction with only one Tire on his Racing Dice! Full speed ahead!\nWe have three more trucks to unveil over the course of the campaign (1 in the base game, and 2 in the Monster Rally expansion). We'll be back with more on those in future updates, and we'll have some new art to show off from artist Benjamin Raynal, as well!\nThe videos shown below were shot at Origins Game Fair 2015. Many of the components are prototypes (albeit close to the final production), and the demo board was built as a mounted, one-sheet poster using the beginning tile set-up. It's important to note that the game will include double-sided, interlocking tiles for variable play instead of one big board.\nEveryone should take a moment to note that Ben Pinchback, co-designer of the game, snuck in all quiet-like with Valkyrie for the win in this video. You can also notice him using his veteran skills to calmly count out spaces to make sure he wasn't spun out in the last stretch of the race to take the win. Ben holds the record for wins in Monster Truck Mayhem, so he's kind of a ringer. Then again, he did design the thing.\nYeah, we said it: NO STRETCH GOALS. And we mean it! We decided to unlock all of them for you from the start.\nWhen we first started planning the Kickstarter campaign, we had broken the game down into several stages. The box was initially going to be smaller, the overall components fewer, and the funding goal a bit lower. Our first stretch goal would have been to monster-size the game once we reached a comfortable funding level, then add additional track pieces. We knew we wanted to provide the Rally expansion bits because that would turn an already-great game into an incredibly-awesome game, so those would be next, broken into two stages. Then we'd dig into some extra trucks if the campaign did well.\nAfter all that, we finally took a step back and realized that we wouldn't want to produce a game without any of that awesome stuff, so we decided to just \"unlock\" all those stretch goals in the beginning, be realistic in our pricing and funding goal, and rev up the engines from the start. Every backer will now automatically get the absolute best of everything in Monster Truck Mayhem without having to wait and see how things progress through the campaign.\nOne pledge level, no stretch goals, just the biggest, baddest, maddest, monster truck racing game ever. Let's do this!\n\"Monster Truck Mayhem is a ton of fun in a few minutes. They say the Kentucky Derby is the most exciting sport in under 2 minutes, and if so, Monster Truck Mayhem may be the most exciting game in under 10 minutes.\" - Richard Launius, designer of Arkham Horror, Defenders of the Realm, Elder Sign & more\n\"Aside from the fervent yelling and screaming coming from the players, the art from Benjamin Raynal might just be the first thing to grab your attention. Vibrant colors on stylized, chunky cartoon monster trucks make the game feel big and in-your-face. The interlocking, modular track tiles (yep, you heard correctly \u2013 modularity = replayability!) have a wonderful amount of detail, from the individual cars waiting to be crushed, to the thick grime of a muddy oil slick that will have you spinning your wheels while your friends catch up. The design of the game makes you feel like you\u2019re there at a monster truck rally.\" - Matt Halstad, League of Nonsensical Gamers\n\"You don't have to wait for Sunday Sunday Sunday to enjoy monster truck racing. You can enjoy it any day with Monster Truck Mayhem. This is a frantic dice rolling game that is loads of fun. Lots of yelling, screaming and laughing as you try to get your truck around the track as fast as possible without spinning out. Great art fits the theme perfectly. Easy to learn, plays fast. Wonderful adrenaline-pumping game.\" - Marty Connell, Rolling Dice & Taking Names\n\"You just aren't prepared for the levels of over-the-top fun that MTM brings. Matt and Ben have created the anti-Feld we've needed for sooo long. MTM is the smartest stupid game I've played in ages, and I'm backing it on Day 1.\" - Paul Imboden, Split Second Games\n\"Monster Truck Mayhem is a frenzied dice fest that's bound to bring out the inner child in anyone. Blowing past your opponent as they shout \"Sunday, Sunday, Sunday!\" at the top of their lungs makes for a raucous fun time. If you want a wildly addictive game that could potentially double as a workout, look no further!\" - Tiffany Bahnsen, Socially Inept Gamer and League of Nonsensical Gamers\n\"I played 3 games of Monster Truck Mayhem at Origins. It is my favorite live-action dice game I have ever played. The game actually IS a race as you are rolling and making decisions as fast as you can. The variable truck powers make the game even crazier and add even more replay value to the package. I don't have any affinity for monster trucks, but this game is awesome. I can't wait to get my own copy.\" - Keith Collins, @MajMalfunction\nWe won't lie, like many other Kickstarter projects, some Dice Hate Me Games projects have been delayed a couple of months beyond their expected release date. Just to be safe and to project a more realistic timeline for our manufacturing deadlines, we decided it would be best to place delivery of this project about a year out. Our hope, however, is that we will deliver much sooner than this anticipated deadline. Based on previous projects, we feel that this is an extremely safe timeline for production. However, we'd much rather surprise all of you with an earlier delivery than a late one - and we're aiming to race this one out fast!\nGame Design: Ben Pinchback & Matt Riddle (Fleet, Eggs & Empires, Floating Market)\nArt: Trucks and box art by Benjamin Raynal (King of Tokyo), base track art by Jeff Brown (Fallen, Monstrous)\nGraphic Design: Chris Kirkman (Brew Crafters, VivaJava, Sunrise City)\nWithout our Kickstarter Backers, Dice Hate Me Games would not be able to bring quality games to market. To show our respect and appreciation, DHMG promises that backer copies of Monster Truck Mayhem will be shipped out before copies are available for purchase at retailers or conventions. DHMG also pledges to keep all backers informed at every step in the development, printing and delivery processes. We love staying in touch with all of our supporters, so please never hesitate to contact us with questions and concerns.\nShipping, in particular international shipping, has been a perpetual headache for us. Amazon and other dedicated online retailers offer free or heavily discounted shipping that we are unable to compete with without enormous losses. As is, we price shipping lower than our actual cost to ship to a given destination, and pledge that your rewards will actually arrive safe and well-protected in shipping, or we will re-send them. Below are our shipping charges for this campaign:\nUS: $10\nCanada: $15\nEU: $35\nOther International: $50\nEU Friendly\nEven though we recognize that the international shipping fees are ridiculous, they will by no means cover all of our international shipping + customs charges. However, we hope that they will at least allow us to not lose money on international rewards. We would rather charge a high shipping fee than get rid of international delivery all together - we love our international backers!\nIf you want to back for multiple copies of the game, you can, and you won\u2019t have to pay for additional shipping! For instance, if you live in Ireland and you and your friends want to go in together and pledge for four copies of the game, you can have one person pledge for $191 \u2014 $39 + $39 + $39 + $39 + $35 for shipping. That would ultimately break down to $8.75 per person for shipping\u2026 much more reasonable! We know international shipping is crazy expensive, but we hope this option helps out a bit.\nFor Christmas in 1983, I asked Santa for a motorized Bigfoot\u00ae monster truck. It had a key in the truck bed that you turned to make it go go go over anything, and that truck went everywhere with me.\nBy the time I was 13, I had just about forgotten Bigfoot\u00ae. Other things started catching my attention, such as, well... girls. Every Fourth of July week in my youth, my family always vacationed in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. There was a particularly fetching young woman staying with her family at our motel. I worked up the courage to ask her for a walk on the beach and a grand night at the local arcade, likely spending a romantic evening duking it out on an old copy of Tapper or Karate Champ. Her simple response: \"Sorry, but I'm headed to a monster truck rally.\" \nBelieve me, I've never forgotten about Bigfoot\u00ae or the other legendary monster trucks from that day forward. \nWhen Ben & Matt first showed me Monster Truck Mayhem I immediately felt like that nine-year-old turning the key in the bed of my awesome Bigfoot\u00ae toy, and I was reminded just how cool - and alluring - monster trucks can be. There's just something about this game that grabs your inner kid. I have witnessed that transformation in so many adult gamers when we've put this game in front of them, and the joy many of them have found in introducing their kids to the fun. I'm so proud to be able to offer this bit of bottled magic to everyone, and I can't wait for each of you to rev up the engines, crush some cars, and feel young again.\nAll the best,\nChris", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project that involves the production and manufacture of a good to be delivered, there is certainly a real chance for hiccups, delays and more than one or two gremlins gumming up the works along the way. Many boardgame projects on Kickstarter have been seriously hampered by art production delays, problems with an overseas factory, missing units and one shipping snafu after another.\n\nLuckily, we have a few projects under our belt, and have dealt with many of those snafus and gremlins along the way. We have a good working relationship with our overseas manufacturer and have become accustomed to their protocols, communication styles and general idiosyncrasies. We try to plan for all contingencies, and have worked through - and learned from - kinks we may have encountered in our past projects.\n\nWe won't lie - stuff happens. Delays can occur. Sometimes you have to go back and forth on color samples six times just to get the color right, and even then the color isn't perfect. Sometimes even personal life events can blindside you. But what we do promise is that we will hold ourselves to the same high standards we expect from other board game publishers, and we will be completely honest and open with each of you every step of the way.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Dice Hate Me Games\n20 created \u00b7 2 backed\nDice Hate Me Games, LLC is a division of Greater Than Games, LLC, committed to bringing entertaining, innovative, and challenging games to...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "Monster Truck Mayhem is Back!", "update_content": "Greetings monster fans!\nJust popping in with a reminder that the new campaign for Monster Truck Mayhem is now live on Kickstarter!

Deck Building: The Deck Building Game and Unpub: The Unpublished Card Game are just these sorts of jokes - um, we mean games. \nNo joke, these really are games. Good games. Fun games. Games that, when we first heard the pitches, we almost felt dared to publish them.\nAnd, so, here we are. Spring is in the air. Flowers are blooming and Rabbits are multiplying. It's April 1st again, and that means some mischievous fun. Welcome to our very bold, very meta experience. Happy card gaming, everyone!\nDeck Building: The Deck Building Game combines the thrill of building your deck with the excitement of building your deck! It comes with 50 artisanally-crafted 70mm square cards, 15 translucent plastic \u201cstain\u201d tokens, and a rules sheet.\nDeck Building is a 10-20 minute game for two players, and is also its own expansion! For each additional copy of Deck Building, you can add one or two players to the game for an ever-larger deckstravaganza!\nHere are some handy videos on how to set up, play, and score a game of Deck Building: The Deck Building Game:\nAnd now you're ready to build a deck!\nUnpub: The Unpublished Card Game is inspired by the spirit of Unpub - an organization devoted to helping game designers craft their unpolished, unpublished stones into sparkling, publishable gems! \nUnpub: The Unpublished Card Game is a 20-30 minute party game for 3 to 8 players. The game comes with 54 cards, each featuring a possible game theme, a core mechanic, and game components that the players will use to craft a game idea. Each round, one player acts as publisher and uses an element from one of their cards to inspire the designers to pitch a game using two of the other three elements on cards in their hand.  The best game pitch gets a publishing contract!\nWell, not a real contract, just in the game. But it could inspire you to create a game that later gets an actual contract. Really. It could happen.\nCheck out the totally polished video below to see it in action!\nTake your game from Unpub to Published!\nDice Hate Me Games titles are broken down into five categories based on both box size and, typically, depth of play. The line is made up of Rabbits (smallest, typically simplest games), Monkeys, Roosters, Tigers, and Dragons (our biggest and most complex - yet to come). As mentioned, the Rabbits are our smallest games, and typically have the simplest rules and fastest play times. You can take a look at our previous Rabbits titles by checking out the previous Kickstarter campaign page here.\nSome examples of each category are The Great Heartland Hauling Co. (Monkey), Compounded and VivaJava: The Coffee Game: The Dice Game (Rooster), and Brew Crafters (Tiger).\nSince this campaign is such a short one, we\u2019re focusing on the products and making them the best they can be, rather than spending resources on additional stretch goals. However, Handelabra - the company that makes the Sentinels of the Multiverse video game - wanted to get in on this project. So, if we manage to reach $250,000, then we have to do this:\nSo, if you\u2019re really excited about that, we suppose that\u2019s an option if we reach that ridiculous level.\nWhile we're waiting to reach the $250,000 stretch goal, how about we go for a noodle?\nACHIEVED! Thanks to everyone's support, we can now add a 4-inch tall punchboard blue noodle to each box of Unpub: The Unpublished Card Game. We think the noodle would be a fun way to indicate which player is acting as publisher for that round. For those who may be unfamiliar with the history of Unpub, a blue pool noodle on a stand has always been used by Unpub participants to indicate the unpublished games areas at conventions. It was a cheap and unique way to signal that playtesting was happening, so the blue noodle became synonymous with Unpub.\nNEW GOAL AT $16,668! In celebration of our final 24 hours, we have one more stretch goal to announce while we wait for that $250,000 to come rolling in, and this time it\u2019s for our woodworking fans! If we can reach $16,668 by the end of the campaign, we\u2019ll produce a custom scorepad for Deck Building: The Deck Building Game! This score pad will not be included in the box, but for each copy of Deck Building that is in your pledge, you\u2019ll receive a custom score pad.\nFor US and Canadian backers, we are charging a flat $5 for shipping. For Canadians, this also covers import taxes and customs duties.\nFor EU customers, we are charging $20 for shipping, and for all other international customers we are charging $30. For customers in the EU, this includes customs duties and import taxes, but it does not for other countries.\nWe know that international shipping is annoyingly expensive; believe us, we are just as annoyed as you are! However, to help offset the shipping costs a bit, we have two work-arounds. First, you can add additional copies of either game to your pledge for +$10, and the shipping rates are fixed regardless of the number of games. If you have a bunch of friends in the UK who want to support this project, just make one group pledge for as many games as you\u2019d like!\nThe other option is our Print and Play pledge level. While you won\u2019t get fancy bits like a box or the cool translucent stain tokens from Deck Building, you will receive high-quality PDFs of both games suitable for professional color printing, and will, of course, incur no shipping charges.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are launching a Kickstarter for two games with humorous themes on April Fools Day with only a 72-hour funding window. There is a real danger that some people will believe that this Kickstarter campaign is a joke, and that the games are either not real, or just \u201cjoke games\u201d. However, we believe that the entertainment value outweighs that risk. The games *are* humorous, but they are also very real, very fun games, and we hope that everyone enjoys them as much as we enjoyed designing and playing them during the development process!\n\nFurthermore, as with any project that involves the production and manufacture of a good to be delivered, there is certainly a real chance for hiccups, delays and more than one or two gremlins gumming up the works along the way. Many boardgame projects on Kickstarter have been seriously hampered by art production delays, problems with an overseas factory, missing units and one shipping snafu after another.\n\nLuckily, we have a few projects under our belt, and have dealt with many of those snags along the way. We try to plan for all contingencies, and we've been fairly successful with that in our past projects. \n\nWe won't lie - stuff happens. Delays can occur. Sometimes you have to go back and forth on color samples six times just to get the color right, and even then the color isn't perfect. But what we do promise is that we will hold ourselves to the same high standards we expect from other board game publishers and our previous projects, and we will be completely honest and open with each of you every step of the way.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #10", "update_userinfo": "Want some more jok...

A game of Bottom of the 9th can easily be played in 5 to 15 minutes.\nBottom of the 9th will feature 20 player cards with beautiful custom art from artist Adam McIver that capture the look of classic baseball trading cards. These cards will even feel like classic trading cards since they will be printed on 1mm punchboard, just like vintage cards.  \nEach player card features abilities that can be used when they gain an upper hand on the opponent, allowing them to manipulate dice. Pitchers have an ace pitch that will activate when they choose to throw it as long as the batter doesn't predict both of the pitch variables (High, Low, Inside, Outside).Batters will have a unique MVP ability that activates whenever the player is able to accurately predict the type of pitch thrown. Most players also have a latent trait that can affect the game, alter their play style - or even give an advantage to the opponent!\nWith myriad customizable line-ups, the possibility of two added expansion packs in the stretch goals, and rules for advanced league and solo play, Bottom of the 9th will keep gamers wanting to play ball time and time again.\nBottom of the 9th will offer the same hallmark replay value as other Dice Hate Me Games titles, with high-quality components, thick punchboard bits, and lots of wood. Here's a list of what you'll find inside the box:\n20 punchboard player cards, full-color front and one-color back, in a foil-wrapped pack\n2 reference cards\n2 playing field pieces in card stock\n1 custom silk-screened Pitch Die\n1 Pitching Control Die\n1 Swing Die \n4 wooden base-runners\n4 wooden Pitch Tokens (2 red, 2 white)\n3 wooden Out markers\n2 wooden Strike markers\n3 wooden Ball markers\n2 wooden Fatigue markers\nPunchboard \"stick of gum\" batter ball and strike count tracker\n15 Event & Scenario mini cards for solo play\nFull-color rulebook\nSticker sheet (for Pitch Tokens and Fatigue Markers)\nBottom of the 9th will come in the Dice Hate Me Games \"Monkey\"-sized box - the same size as The Great Heartland Hauling Co., Belle of the Ball, and Carnival. What's this crazy talk? Take a look here for more information on our box sizes and game categories!\nBottom of the 9th is a distinguished alum of the Unpub program - a series of public and private playtest events held each year to help designers present, hone and polish their game designs with the gaming public, as well as board game production professionals.\nHow to play Bottom of the 9th, from Rodney Smith of Watch it Played!\nWatch a full game of Bottom of the 9th! \nWant to try out Bottom of the 9th for yourself? You can download the print-and-play files right here! You'll need to provide a few components of your own (like some tokens and three dice), but we'll give you the board, the rules, and a sampling of enough pitchers and batters to really get a feel for the game.\nFor those wanting a video how-to-play, here's a great overview of game play by Steve Tower of After Further Review.\nRodney Smith of Watch It Played is also preparing one of his excellent gameplay videos that should be available later this week. Stay tuned, and we'll post as soon as it's ready!\nAnd for those wanting to know more about the development of the game and a discussion on gameplay, you can listen to designer Darrell Louder talk all about it on Ep. 80 of The State of Games podcast! It's a great episode, all about the Dice Hate Me Games and Greater Than Games merger, but for those just wanting jump straight into the Bottom of the 9th action, that starts at the 1hr 11min mark!\nBottom of the 9th was originally designed as a head-to-head competition between two players - that is, until veteran game designer Richard Launius (Defenders of the Realm; Arkham Horror; Run, Fight or Die)  caught baseball fever after playing the game. \nRichard has been a fan for much of his life - the Chicago White Sox adopted his uniform design for the ball club back in 1981, after all - so when the veteran game designer dropped us a line and said he had an idea for solo play? We were all ears.\nThe man, the myth, the legend - Richard Launius, ace fielder.\nRichard's design concept pits one player, controlling the batting lineup, against a randomly-controlled ace pitcher. Scenario and event cards control the game state, creating managing decisions during the game for the player-controlled team. Mike Mullins has been developing and refining Richard's core concept through tweaks and tests, and we are very excited to offer this solo play option inside the box.\nStay tuned to future updates for a link to the refined solo rules!\nAchieving our base funding goal ensures that Dice Hate Me Games will be able to publish Bottom of the 9th with the quality that we all have come to expect. The base game of Bottom of the 9th is priced according to our initial funding goal; however, if we exceed that funding goal we will be able to add more to the game!\nHere is a list of potential stretch goals that would allow us to upgrade components and help us add expansion decks to the game!\nACHIEVED! Folding Playing Field game board - One goal we're super excited about, which is why we put it first! We can now upgrade the Playing Field from cardstock to a thick, dual-fold game board!\nACHIEVED! Laser-etched Pitching Die - We can now afford to upgrade the custom Pitch Control Die from silk-screened to laser-etched.\nACHIEVED! Big League Support expansion pack - This stretch goal introduces 12 new player cards to the game in an expansion pack outside the box (some of which you can see above). There'll be some new pitchers and batters, but with this pack we'll also introduce support personnel such as general managers, a trainer, and even mascots. It'll even be foil-wrapped like baseball cards! The retail value of the expansion pack will be $4.95, but each backer will receive the Big League Support pack for free as part of their pledge!\nACHIEVED! Silk-screened Pitching Tokens - We can now do away with the sticker sheet and silk screen the information right onto the wooden Pitching Tokens!\nACHIEVED! Custom Base Runner Meeples - With this stretch goal, the base runners will be wearing little hats and sprinting for the next base!\nACHIEVED! Sentinels of the 9th expansion pack - In case you missed the news, Dice Hate Me Games and Greater Than Games (makers of the awesome Sentinels of the Multiverse line of card games) have merged! That means we can easily combine resources and do crazy things like put superheroes in our baseball games! In this expansion, you'll be able to bring some familiar Multiverse heroes and characters like Legacy, Haka, Tempest and Mr. Chomps to the field. This would be another expansion pack added outside of the box and retailing for $4.95 - but, of course, backers will receive it for free, adding even more value to your pledge!\nACHIEVED! Custom Pitcher Meeple - This stretch goal will be a little meeple for the mound! It serves no in-game purpose, but it's still amazingly cool. This will be a Kickstarter promotional not included in the regular retail version of the game, and will only be initially available as convention or contest promotionals.\nPlease help spread the word of Bottom of the 9th to family, friends and anyone else you think would enjoy the game so that we can reach our funding goal and roll out those stretch goals!\n\u201cBottom of the 9th is the best baseball simulation I have ever played.\u201d - Mike Fitzgerald, veteran designer of Wyvern, Mystery Rummy, Hooyah, and Baseball Highlights: 2045 (and not to take anything away from Mike's own Baseball Highlights: 2045 which is one of the best baseball games we've ever played)\n\u201cNot since APBA have I enjoyed a baseball game as much as Bottom of the 9th. Suspense, strategy, getting into your opponents head, and dice make this a game that is a Must Buy on the Rolling Dice & Taking Names game scale.\u201d - Tony McRee, Rolling Dice & Taking Names podcast \n\u201cBottom of the 9th is exactly what I wanted it to be - a tense and exciting showdown between pitcher and batter with everything on the line.\u201d - Ben Pinchback, co-designer of Fleet and Eggs & Empires\n\"I could give you a longer review \u2013 yes, but this is a meeple-sized one. And in the end, it really boils down to this \u2013 Bottom of the 9th feels like a game that Dice Hate Me Games would put out, not just in its classic Americana theme, but also in its gameplay. Games published by Dice Hate Me seem to have their own rhythm and cadence in their gameplay, and Bottom of the 9th fits that \u201cDice Hate Me Games feel\u201d to a tee. If you are a fan of baseball or even a fan of games published by Dice Hate Me Games, Bottom of the 9th really should be a game you take a closer look at.\" - Ryan Sanders, The Inquisitive Meeple \n\"Bottom of the 9th is reminiscent of the old, pure, luck-based dice-rolling baseball games. It adds strategy and replayability while retaining enough of a luck mechanic to keep you twitching for your d6 when that pesky batter manages to catch a piece of a pitch and you need to throw him out at first. Quick, fun, and addicting. Best sports game you don't play with a ball.\" - Brian Gerdwagen\n\"This game is tons of fun. It offers up the same feeling of tension as you would while playing (or watching) a real game when it is all on the line. Each game you play will tell a different story.\" - Steebin, The League of Nonsensical Gamers\n\"Love how much tension was crammed into such a small game. The selection of pitch location and then the die roll really had you on edge. I also really enjoyed the nostalgia you incorporated with the layout/design.\u201d - Dan Halstad, League of Nonsensical Gamers\n\"Loved this game. Instant backer when it hits Kickstarter!\u201d - Steve Seebode, Unpub designer and playtester\nFor those true ball fans who want the very best, we're proud to offer a limited amount of ALL-STAR GAME pledge levels. When you pledge for this level, you'll receive one full copy of Bottom of the 9th signed by Darrell and Mike with all applicable stretch goals, as well as a special clipboard field, signed and numbered, complete with several sheets of box score tracking pads to record your games and league play! You'll also receive a limited promotional Bl\u00fcdle the Noodle mascot card - the official mascot of the Unpub Network! Bl\u00fcdle was given away as a promotional at Unpub 5 in Baltimore, so only attendees of that convention own an official Bl\u00fcdle.\nThese promotional items will only be available for purchase during this Kickstarter campaign. However, you may still be able to find Bl\u00fcdle through certain convention giveaways, or by using Sentinels Points at the Greater Than Games booth at conventions. The clipboards will be given out as prizes for winners of upcoming Bottom of the 9th tournaments at conventions. So if you don't grab the ALL-STAR GAME pledge level here, keep an eye out for these possible promotions at conventions throughout the year!\nAnd if you still really, really want Bl\u00fcdle and can't get an ALL-STAR GAME pledge level, you can add on a promotional Bl\u00fcdle card to any pledge for an additional $5! This card is slightly different than the limited card given out at Unpub 5, but it'll still enable you to easily add Bl\u00fcdle to your games of Bottom of the 9th!\nWithout our Kickstarter Backers, Dice Hate Me Games would not be able to bring quality games to market. To show our respect and appreciation, DHMG promises that backer copies of Bottom of the 9th will be shipped out before copies are available for purchase at retailers or conventions. DHMG also pledges to keep all backers informed at every step in the development, printing and delivery processes. We love staying in touch with all of our supporters, so please never hesitate to contact us with questions and concerns.\nGreetings ball gamers!\nIt\u2019s officially spring training time and I am super excited for this Kickstarter campaign! Since we started developing and showing off Bottom of the 9th a year ago, so many board game and baseball fans have been expressing enthusiasm and support for the game. Honestly, I can\u2019t remember a game that we\u2019ve announced that has generated more buzz and excitement than Bottom of the 9th, and that is humbling and amazing!\nIt\u2019s also an exciting time for Dice Hate Me Games, as we recently announced our merger with Greater Than Games, which you can read all about here and listen to us talk about here. Some of you who have been supporters of Dice Hate Me Games for a few years now have asked if this will change anything about what DHMG is known for or what we love to do. The emphatic answer is absolutely not - this can only make things better! Dice Hate Me Games and Greater Than Games will be able to work together to bring you the absolute best games out there, guaranteed. This is an amazing opportunity for us - and an incredible time to be a fan of both companies!\nAs always, I appreciate the continued love and support from our Kickstarter family. You\u2019re the absolute best in the game!\nHappy ballgaming!\nChris", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project that involves the production and manufacture of a good to be delivered, there is certainly a real chance for hiccups, delays and more than one or two gremlins gumming up the works along the way. Many boardgame projects on Kickstarter have been seriously hampered by art production delays, problems with an overseas factory, missing units and one shipping snafu after another.\n\nLuckily, we have a few projects under our belt, and have dealt with many of those snafus and gremlins along the way. We have a good working relationship with our overseas manufacturer and have become accustomed to their protocols, communication styles and general idiosyncrasies. We try to plan for all contingencies, and have worked through - and learned from - kinks we may have encountered in our past projects.\n\nWe won't lie - stuff happens. Delays can occur. Sometimes you have to go back and forth on color samples six times just to get the color right, and even then the color isn't perfect. Sometimes even personal life events can blindside you. But what we do promise is that we will hold ourselves to the same high standards we expect from other board game publishers, and we will be completely honest and open with each of you every step of the way.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #30", "update_userinfo": "The Clubhouse Expansion is live!", "update_content": "Hey, everyone!

Basically, everything about the game stays the same except for a slight change to \"The Stare Down.\" In that phase, you set the pitch (i.e. low and away) in the normal manner. Then you take the counters for the batter, cup them in your hands, and roll them like dice to get a random outcome. Play then continues as normal. Essentially, this means you are playing the pitcher's side of the game - setting the pitch purposefully without knowing where the batter will swing. But that makes sense since the pitcher has strategy factors in \"The Stare Down\" (fatigue and an ace pitch) where the batter does not. I've also found the decision-making that follows in \"The Pitch\" and \"The Swing\" to be pretty straight forward. Whether the pitcher or batter should +1, -1, roll again, etc. is fairly obvious within the game (that is NOT a complaint), no matter who you are rooting for to win. So it is not difficult to be honest in how you play even thought you are controlling both sides.

We believe that there are a great number of Gay, Lesbian, Transgender, Gender Queer, and Bisexual folks out there, of every color and creed, that at the end of the day, love to geek out. Geek about video games, tabletop games, tech, comics - all that fun stuff. And we believe that creating a community for these folks, Gaymers as they are affectionally dubbed, is important to help shape a more tolerant and safer space in gaming. After all, everyone games.\nThe stereotypes about gamers are many, but the core is the perception that gamers are usually straight white guys in dark rooms furiously mashing at a controller. That\u2019s not the reality. Gamers come in all sizes, genders, races, and sexual identities. Unfortunately stereotypical bias among gamers does exist and it can make a hostile environment for minorities in the gaming community. Hang around an online game long enough and you\u2019ll start hearing homophobic, racial, and misogynistic slurs slung around without a second thought. Gamers, as a whole, have had to make space for themselves in a society that, for a long time, treated them as outsiders. They have come together and created a real community of people, but one that is not always welcoming if you don\u2019t fit into the mold. Just like most gamers, queer geeks and gaymers want that same sense of community and belonging. Therefore we intend to create a space where all gamers and queer geeks can come together in a welcoming and safe space.\nThis space is GaymerCon.\nWe are creating a convention where all types of geeks can come together, meet others like them, and have a blast without having to worry about what their peers think of them or being discriminated against.. We will have exhibitor space, cosplay, guest speakers, live music, panel discussions on topics that are directly relevant to our interests, gaming industry professionals who support including queer content in their products, social events, and of course\u2026GAMING!\nWe will also have events and activities that target other areas of geek and tech culture besides gaming. From tabletop gaming to geek chic, from panels by tech leaders to cosplay and live music- we hope to have something for everyone.\nWe want to be clear this isn\u2019t just for gay white dudes either. We want all genders, races, and sexual identities including our straight friends and allies to come together and have a gay, geeky good time. We believe very strongly that creating a space like this is not only important for building a strong community, but also showing new generations of gaymers that there are others like them out there, they are not alone, and there is a welcoming place for them, not just at GaymerCon, but as part of the larger gaming community. \nWHAT THE MONEY IS FOR\nGaymerCon is going to happen no matter what in the late summer of 2013, but big events like this don\u2019t happen by magic and certainly aren\u2019t cheap. This is where you come in. Without any donations we will create a great space for gaymers to come together, build community, and have fun. WITH your donations however, we can reserve swankier and more centrally located venues, book more geeky bands to play for you, have more consoles and games to play on, have cool prizes for contests, and more. Basically the more you give, the more you get out of the con when you come. If we raise lots and lots of money, it will get the attention of the gaming industry, making them more likely to come to the show too so you can see their awesome stuff, but also let them know there is a market out there for gaymers and maybe they should pay attention to you. All this for what it costs for a day pass to most other conventions....oh and did we mention that almost all pledges come with a free pass to the con? Yup. That\u2019s a thing. Go ahead and go donate. We\u2019ll wait.\nCan't come to GaymerCon? We also have sticker packs and Blue/Red GaymerCon Bitroms, for those supporters who want a little more Gaymer in their lives.\nBitroms are entirely original hand-made cartridge necklaces - choose from either Fire Red Conway, Cool Blue Turing, or (at higher levels) you can get the limited Kickstarter-edition Turing & Conway's Adventure.\nHOW DO YOU KNOW WE WON\u2019T JUST SPEND THE MONEY ON MOUNTAIN DEW AND CHEETOS\nWe know we can make Gaymercon a success because we are already experienced in being successful. We have a team of extremely talented, connected, amazing folks on the team including engineers and business folks at top startups here in San Francisco. These include Jack DeVries out of IGN, Zach Weiner from SMBC Comics which is one of the largest comics and websites in the world and Matt Conn from the founding team of BandPage, as well as other visionaries and leaders from the LBGT & fundraising world.\nAlso: Cheetos and Mountain Dew? Ew.\nPlease consider contributing and we hope to see you in August 2013.\nWait...you\u2019re still not convinced? Alright. Fine. Time to bring out the big guns. What if I told you that a certain evil computer from a certain video game that starts with a \u201cP\u201d and ends with an \u201cortal\u201d thought you should? You really going to say no to her?\nSee you at GaymerCon 2013!\nTweet at us at @GaymerCon or follow us at facebook.com/gaymercon to stay up to date. We won't camp at your spawn point. Promise.\nFAQ\nWho are you?\nWe are a bunch of geeks and allies based mostly around the Bay and Seattle areas. Most of us work in the tech or gaming space.\n\nWhy isn't there a venue set?\nThat's one of the main reasons why we're holding this Kickstarter - depending on demand and the amount raised, we'll be able to find a location that fits the expected attendance. The more we raise, the more awesome the space we can get, and hopefully get some awesome panels and bosses of honor, too!\n\nWhy is it in San Francisco? Why isn't it in ______?\nSan Francisco is where the highest concentration of gaming, geekdom, tech, and gay communities all coincide, and for year one, we want to make sure it is in an area where there is already, what we hope, is strong demand.\nWho are Conway and Turing?\nConway and Turing are based off of two LGBT geek heroes that we wish to honor as well as help educate the young folks on:  Alan Turing, with whom we would not all the amazing technology and toys that we have to today, and Lynn Conway, engineering pioneer and activist for the transgender community.\n\nI'm under 18 - Can I go?\nFor at least the first year, GaymerCon will be an 18+ event. Although we understand that helping create a safe space for youth is just as important to our mission, for year one, there are a lot of insurance and liability issues to take into account with minors. If you'd still like to come, please let us know so we can gauge demand!\nI'm Straight! Can I come? \nOf course! We want to create a gaming and tech event that focuses on queer issues and themes, not the other way around. Similar to Gay & Lesbian film festivals and cultural events, we welcome all and hope to provide a fun, exciting, vibrant community that is in no way closed off from the rest of the gaming community.\nI don't think something is a good idea becuase of [valid reason]/I would like to see [something cool]\nWe are always down to discuss and help explain our point of view and also listen to, and learn, from others. We are forging new ground with GaymerCon and a helping build a new community - and we want to hear what you think. Please drop us a line on fb or @gaymercon\nI would like to troll you because... \nBe nice, please. We're trying to create something that we believe can help make the lives of gay geeks around the world a bit more interesting and more social. We can take the heat, but we'd prefer if you could please keep it civil.\nWait, I'll only sponsor this if I can get in the field reccomendations from my peers set to Japanese chiptune music.\nGot it.\nNEW! \nSTRETCH GOALS!!\n35K - GAYMERCONCERT! (UPDATE: WE DID IT!!!) GaymerCon will hold a GaymerConcert on Saturday night, bringing in musicians and bands that appeal greatly to the Gaymer community, for a night of drinking, dancing and socializing! Chiptune slow dance, anyone?\n50K - GAYMER BRUNCHFAST FOR THOSE PLEDGING $100+! (UPDATE: WE DID THIS TOO!!!!) Many of you have said that you wish you could have lunch with us on Sunday, but we wanted to make sure that that was special to those who donated at that level. However, we really want to meet with everyone one of you, soooo... if we hit $50K, everyone who has donated $100 or more will be invited to have free breakfast with us the Sunday morning of the con. This will be a bigger group, but we'll still try to make our way around to thank each one of you in person. It will be our honor to do so. If you've already pledged below $100 and want to join...just up it to $100 and you're in.\n60K- CELEBRITY BOSS OF HONOR: (UPDATE: SUPER FINAL BOSS MODE UNLOCKED!) GaymerCon will bring in a real awesome celebrity to be an official BOSS OF HONOR. Think of all the gay, lesbian, trans, and allied geek celebrities out there - who would YOU like to see?\n100K: GAYMERCONNECT: We want to build an app - web first, then mobile, called GaymerConnect. The idea? That you can easily go in and find other Gaymers to play your favorite games with. Playing Call of Duty? Here are all the Queer Clans. Looking for someone to fight against in Street Fighter 4? Here are 20 awesome geeks to play against.\nThe best (and most relevant) part: we can coordinate GaymerConnect with GaymerCon itself, setting up an easy and instant way for you to connect online with all the awesome people you meet at the con.

Next, we achieved our first set of stretch goals in under 1 week! Now we have met our second set of expanded goals in just 2 weeks!\nRead Update #4: OMG! 1000 backers! (and about that harassment stuff)\nAbout this Project:\nI love playing video games but I\u2019m regularly disappointed in the limited and limiting ways women are represented.  This video project will explore, analyze and deconstruct some of the most common tropes and stereotypes of female characters in games.  The series will highlight the larger recurring patterns and conventions used within the gaming industry rather than just focusing on the worst offenders.  I\u2019m going to need your help to make it happen!\nAs a gamer, a pop culture critic and a fan, I\u2019m always working to balance my enjoyment of media while simultaneously being critical of problematic gender representations. With my video web series Feminist Frequency,  I look at the way women are portrayed in mass media and the impact they have on our culture and society.\nTHE PROJECT\nWith your help, I\u2019ll produce a 5-video series (now expanded to 12 videos) entitled Tropes vs Women in Video Games, exploring female character stereotypes throughout the history of the gaming industry.  This ambitious project will primarily focus on these reoccurring tropes: \nDamsel in Distress - Video #1\nThe Fighting F#@k Toy - Video #2\nThe Sexy Sidekick - Video #3\nThe Sexy Villainess - Video #4\nBackground Decoration - Video #5\n1st Set of Stretch Goals Achieved!\nVoodoo Priestess/Tribal Sorceress - Video #6\nWomen as Reward - Video #7\nMrs. Male Character - Video #8\nUnattractive Equals Evil - Video #9\nMan with Boobs - Video #10\nPositive Female Characters! - Video #11\n2nd Stretch Goal Achieved! \nLet's Bump up the Production Quality!\n3rd Set of Stretch Goals Achieved!\nTropes vs Women in Video Games Classroom Curriculum \nVideo #12 - Top 10 Most Common Defenses of Sexism in Games\nEach video will be between 10 and 20 minutes long and available online for free for everyone and anyone to watch, share and use.\nCreating these videos take a lot of time and money to produce. I will be researching and playing hundreds of titles from across the gaming industry (including some truly awful games that I wouldn\u2019t wish upon anyone!). Your support will go towards production costs, equipment, games and downloadable content.\nPlease pledge any amount you can and become a backer of Feminist Frequency\u2019s Tropes vs Women in Video Games!\nFeminist Frequency is an ongoing web series of video commentaries focusing on representations of gender, race, class, sexuality and ability in pop culture. \nLast year I released a video series called Tropes vs Women analyzing female representations in the mainstream media.  This previous series was highly successful and shared all over the web.  Not only did it provide people the language to understand the media they were engaging with, but it's even served as a guide for some professional writers and media creators to actively avoid gendered character stereotypes and create more in-depth, and more engaging female characters.  \nHelp me create another successful video series that will contribute to and help amplify the existing conversations happening about female characters in games and maybe even get the attention of the gaming industry to start creating more interesting, engaging and complex female characters, that avoid the standard boring cliches.\nVisit FeministFrequency.com to see examples of my previous video work.\nKickstarter doesn't have subtitle integration with their videos so I've posted a full transcript of the video here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #43", "update_userinfo": "Free Classroom Curriculum is here!", "update_content": "Hi everyone!\nWe are thrilled to announce that an outstanding curriculum supporting the Tropes vs. Women in Video Games series is now available!

Having only played one of the older Tomb Raider games back in the day, and none of the Uncharted series, I don't know much of the history we're discussing here. I do think that the complaints you're seeing are probably coming for three different reasons, despite the similarity you rightly point out between the two game series and why Tomb Raider might seek to emulate Uncharted. First: Players who stick with a game series even when it doesn't change are often fond of the formula as-is. I remember Tomb Raider being the kind of game where Lara was generally a wisecracking badass, more directly comparable to Indiana Jones than anyone else. Like Indiana Jones, she was completely in control, but it seemed that inevitably, one of her helpful contacts would betray her in the middle of the adventure, causing an annoying setback. If this formula may be lost in the new game, which seems to take on a more serious tone, the old fans who liked things as they were might be disappointed, feeling that something is being fixed that wasn't broken. Second: I've watched a youtube video showing the demo and the trailer, and in one spot of the demo when the guy grabs Lara's leg, she shrieks in rising terror and eventually kicks him off. I think the way in which this was portrayed may feel to many like the threat that Lara can get raped is being introduced at all, even though she gets herself out of the situation. So the complaint might just be that if it was Nathan, he wouldn't be wriggling and shrieking in the same way because he'd be portrayed as responding to the same assault differently. This could be the characters being different, but we're agreed that Lara Croft and Nathan of Uncharted are really similar in personality, so why should she act differently (frightened and shrieking) than he would in this situation? It's suspicious. Third: I also think people might be concerned since this is the first Tomb Raider game published since Eidos was acquired by Square-Enix (though there was a game lacking the name Tomb Raider according to the timeline I've found on Wikipedia). Square-Enix's handling of the character is bound to be a little different than previous games', and the creative team on the project may be totally different. That's a legitimate concern for the character being treated in a different way, and could lead people to worry about how it will turn out based on what little they've seen so far.", "time": "about 9 years ago"}, {"username": "Rebecca Richards", "content": "Please continue your great work.

Final Fantasy X-2 is seen as more of a comedic diversion and fanservice to those who didn't want Final Fantasy X to end. And while that is okay, female characters deserve better than that. Final Fantasy over the years hasn't done much to do that. I would also say, yeah, that's the problem with Final Fantasy VI, Terra wasn't made clearly a female protagonist.

How many bars are there here for those of us who would rather watch Battlestar Galactica than a football game? None that we could think of.\n\nWe decided that St. Louis nerds and geeks NEED a place to congregate and know that they are in good company- the company of fellow individuals who share an interest in the less mainstream pursuits, such as science fiction, technology, video games, anime, intellectual pursuits, and almost anything else \"geeky\" one can imagine.\n\nOur dream is to create a social hub that brings people together in an environment that enables them to use their common interests and passions to build relationships with the business, the community and each other. \n\nThat said, in the spirit of fostering such a community, we welcome any and all ideas, suggestions, and help in realizing this dream of ours. We want YOU to be a part of creating this safe-haven for anyone and everyone who relishes in the unusual, the imaginative, and the geeky.\nSpecial Abilities\n20 Beers on Draft - $3.00 PBRs Always Available\nOver 180 Barchievements to experience with rewards at milestones\nCreate Your Own Dining Experience by Bringing in Food From Wherever You Want\n15-20 Classic Arcade Games - Think Ms. Pacman, Galaga and Donkey Kong with a consistent high-score leader board in the bar and online\nFree Wi-Fi\nTONS of Power Outlets for Your Electricty-Hungry Portable Devices\nWeekly Presentations from Local Scientists, Researchers, and Professors\nA Free Library of Books For You to Enjoy\nA Selection of Awesome Board Games - Think Chess, Settlers of Catan, Risk, Puerto Rico, Battlestar Galactica, Munchkin, and Game of Thrones\nPartnerships With Local Theatre, Comedy Troupes and Cultural Institutions\nParnterships With Local Universities\nPartnerships With Local Restaurants\nGeeks United Can Make this Happen\nWe have over 1200 enthusiastic Facebook fans ready to walk through our doors . Everyone involved in this project has contributed large amounts of pro-bono time and talent to get the project this far. Literally, this has been a labor of love for everyone from the designers and architects, to our artists, musicians and videographers. Now we need your help to make what will be an awesome place a reality which is why we're going to Kickstarter for your help!\nWhat Your Money Will be Used For\nDesinging, building and opening a Geek Bar (while fun!) isn't cheap. Collaborating with local architects and designers, we've estimated the total costs to start the bar will be around $68,000.00. While this wouldn't cover all our costs, it would help to cover the following expenses:\nPlumbers and Electricians.\nMaterials and build out.\nCapital equipment - think: coolers, refrigerators, ice machines, dishwashers and sinks\nPoint of Sales System \nProperty improvements - think: flooring, lighting, painting and other upgrades.\nHow you can help\n1. Donate generously. We are on the cusp of creating something great for St. Louis, PLEASE help us realize our shared dream.\n\n2. Invite everyone you can possibly think of to donate even if it's just $5.\n\n3. Share our Kickstarter page, our website, one of our updates, tweet about us or just re-post on your wall.\n\n4. Tell friends and family members who you think might also be interested;\n\n5. Promote us to the media!  We're underdogs and we're doing something that is unique.  These are precisely the the type of stories that get covered.\nThank you for taking the time to read through our Kickstarter campaign.  We are greatly appreciative for you taking the time out to read about your project.\nRemember that we ONLY get the funding if we reach our goal, and likewise you only get your rewards if we reach our goal - this is ALL OR NOTHING. \nBe a part of making St. Louis a cool place to live!

An alliance of Dwarves and Men are pitted in a battle of survival against the evil hordes of Goblins and the nefarious Undead. To win, players recruit massive armies, build cities, develop technology, and conquer territory in an effort to defeat their opponents by ultimately capturing their homeland. Beyond the mere battling of armies and world conquest, players direct the development of heroes to explore dungeons, battle fierce creatures, and gain valuable treasure and spells that can be used to turn the tides of war against their foes.\nWarparty allows challenges and immersion for new players as well as seasoned veterans, offering the possibility for many different strategic avenues for players to master. Each army is compiled with many unique units that offer each army not only it\u2019s own flavor by it\u2019s own diverse set of strategies.\nThis will be a beautiful, high-quality game. Two mounted game boards, lavishly drawn playing pieces and cards.\nCounters\n244 Full Color Army Counters\n34 Misc.

Night of Man is a card-driven, tactical board game. Set in a post-alien-invasion-of-Earth universe, the squads, heroes, and tanks of Earth's Militia battle against powerful aliens with enhanced power armor, hover tanks, biped robotic tanks, and spider-like robots. Gamers have a four card hand and may play a card, sometimes more, in each impulse. The cards activate units to move, fire, assault, and use special powers, such as explosive rounds, telekinesis, and more. Special cards, such as critical hit or bullet storm, can also enhance a unit'sattacks. Each turn continues until three end turn cards have been drawn. Players then choose one card from their hand to keep, the administrative markers are removed from the board, and a new hand is dealt to each player. The players use that new hand, or the card kept from the previous turn, to bid for initiative in the new turn.
