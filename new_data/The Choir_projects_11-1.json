The title has personal meaning for me, but it is just a clever way of saying \"without a word\".   \nTO BE HONEST, I didn't mean to make an instrumental record, never mind a jazz album.  I just had the itch to record with some friends.  I'm not a trained musician, but whenever I sit down to play the piano, something like jazz happens.   When I played some of this music for a few intimate friends, the response was unanimous- \"This music needs to be heard\".  \nSO, HERE IT IS- \"CRICKETS\"!\nThe band is smoking on these 10 self penned songs, and I'm excited to share the music with my fans, old and new.  All backers will receive the digital download before Christmas!  \nThe record is finished, but I need to pay costs of manufacturing and marketing, and that's where you, the listener, come in.  Most of you know the drill- this is how we get a lot of our music these days, and I'm so grateful for the opportunity to work with you to get my music in your hands.  $10,000 is the bare minimum to meet most of my expenses, and I'm happy to say we have met that goal.\nSo here are the \"STRETCH GOALS\",  which need to be met by December 14th, less than two weeks away:\nAt $15,000 EVERYONE will receive a free download EP of me playing Holiday songs on piano- funky, jazzy, heartfelt renditions that no one has ever heard!  \nMercyland: Hymns For The Rest Of Us, Volume One\nAt $20,000, EVERYONE will receive \"Mercyland: Hymns For The Rest Of Us\" Volume 1, which includes Emmylou Harris, Buddy Miller, John Scofield, CIndy Morgan, Mat Kearney, North Mississippi Allstars, Shawn Mullins, and more!  (At $20k, digital only backers will receive a download of Mercyland; physical backers will receive the CD and the download!).\nI've got backer rewards that have been popular in past campaigns- a limited edition T shirt, my hand-painted postcards, songwriting sessions, CDs, Vinyl, and more.  But the most exciting thing to me is the music.  Long after your T shirt gets worn out, these grooves will keep spinning.  \nThanks for your support!Meanwhile, below you can see some postcards I've painted that exemplify the span of ideas if you wish to order the custom painting from me.\nPhil's handpainted postcards", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my 5th Kickstarter campaign.

Then life happened. \nThe past few years have felt like wandering in the desert, in a myriad of ways. I had to face some hard truths about myself and ask some hard questions, about who I am, what I believe, and what I'm called to do.\nThese questions led to my podcast, The Pivot, which has been a real joy to produce. It also led to this new project, \"The Painted Desert\".\n\"The Painted Desert\" is, I pray, the album version of conversation with a friend where you have the freedom to be real with doubt, fear AND hope.\nI wanted this record to be beautiful. I wanted it to have space for listeners to think, feel, and remember.\nThis is absolutely my favorite thing I've ever done and I'm so very excited for you to hear it.\nI'm also excited that streaming and social media can allow my music to reach new people. That's why the funds raised here on Kickstarter, after they pay the folks who worked on the record, will go towards marketing and playlist promotion. I really want as many people as possible to get to hear these songs.\n\"The Painted Desert\" will officially release in its entirety in October. I'll put songs out on Spotify and iTunes one or two at a time, so that I can tell the story of the record throughout the year, not just release week. \nThat means THIS WILL BE THE ONLY TIME to get the full record for a while. (Unless you come to one of my shows.)\nMy last Kickstarter took a lot longer to complete than anticipated, and I hated that feeling. That's why this time the record is done beforehand. Support today and you'll get an immediate download of the album. CDs, hats, books and such will all be made as soon as the Kickstarter is done so you'll get the rewards quickly, as well.\nDeep thanks to the amazing people who have already worked on this project: Shane Wilson, Josh and Becca Wilson, Joe Causey, Zach McNair, Paul Eckberg, Laura Preston, Kim Fisher, Randall and Amy Goodgame, Jeremy Casella, Nathan Johnson, Cason Cooley, Greg LaFollette, Russ Ramsey, Chris & Jenna Badeker (Wild Harbors), and most wonderfully, my wife and daughters. These are amazing people whose work on the record was a real gift.\nI'm so proud of this project and so thankful to have had the opportunity to make it. It feels special to me and I hope it connects with you in a unique and helpful way.\nThanks for checking this out and for your support.

I'm looking forward to sharing the music with you all later this year. Just a reminder for those of you who backed the campaign to please check the updates section for backers only and download a couple of the songs from the forthcoming album when ever you have a chance. I am so grateful and offer my sincerest thanks. \nNew to the Campaign- Hear a Song from the album:\nListen to Let You Be Mine, a new song from my album by clicking on the image below:\nAbout Me\nMy story is probably not much different than many of those who have worked closely in the music and film industry. I started with a love for music, guitar, songs and playing in bands through High School and College, and somewhere along the way got drawn into helping some wonderful artists and friends bring their music to the world. \n\nSome of you know me as an artist manager and advocate, a concert promoter, a record producer, or possibly as the co-founder of The Soulfest (New England), Fingerprint Records, New Sound International, or perhaps to some of you I\u2019m just another Harley Davidson rider.\n\nOver the past 35 years, I\u2019ve had the honor, privilege, and good fortune to work closely with many inspiring artists, including the late Michael Been and Mark Heard, as well as The Call, U2, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Sam Phillips, Vigilantes of Love, Bruce Cockburn, Switchfoot, Ramona Silver, Rachel Taylor, The Violet Burning and many others.\nI grew up in a home surrounded by and filled with music. Music brought life into focus and was the primary way I related to my family, my friends, and to my world.\n\nWhen I was about 13 years old I started playing the drums on a classic Ludwig drum kit, which I traded to one of the guitar players in a High School band. I took a few lessons on guitar to learn the songs everyone at my school wanted to hear and that\u2019s where my foundation was poured. The Rolling Stones, Allman Brothers, Dylan, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Eric Clapton, Led Zeppelin, The Clash, The Band, Neil Young and so many others.\n\nIn College, going to shows and seeing every new band that came through Boston or anywhere close, was my number one priority. So many shows had a powerful impact on me.  As one thing led to another I worked in various support capacities with more artists then I can remember, but essentially ended up touring throughout the world and experienced first hand how powerful music impacted and changed lives.\nSome artists asked me to help with tour management, others with record production and a few with career management. Putting my own musical and artistic dreams aside, I worked for and with artists that impacted me deeply which motivated me to share my experience and their music with the world. \nRecently I decided to work less on the business side of music and to start writing songs again. With my son, Jesse\u2019s encouragement, along with the rest of my family and a new friend, Michael Pritzl, I decided to record a few old songs, finish some new ideas and make an album.\nLife has been a big circle for me, but here I am ready to complete something I intended to do many many years ago. I hope that you\u2019ll consider helping me complete this circle of mine.

This film explores the toxic side effects of the entertainment industry within the family structure set against the backdrop of a classic New England ghost story.\nSet over the course of a single evening at the Reynolds\u2019 Family home in suburban Connecticut, Clara\u2019s Ghost tells the story of Clara Reynolds who, fed up with constant ribbing from her self-centered showbiz family, finds solace in and guidance from the supernatural force she believes is haunting her. \nThe Elliott Family home and our filming location\nStarring Chris, Abby, Bridey, and their mom Paula Elliott in the lead roles and to be shot on location at their home in Old Lyme, Connecticut, Clara\u2019s Ghost offers fictionalized but personal insight into one of America\u2019s favorite comedy dynasties. When you think of the Elliotts, you think: wacky, attractive, wealthy, successful, but you never think: sad, bitter, alcoholic, egomaniacs... or do you? \nAbby, Bridey, their grandfather Bob, and Chris\nA NOTE FROM THE DIRECTOR \nThis film is about family. It\u2019s about our capacity to love and understand each other while reconciling the inevitable alienation that sets in as families grow up. My parents have been empty nesters for almost ten years now, my sister will soon be starting her own family, and I, well I\u2019m not there yet, but I do have a cat. We are on our own journeys. \nYes, this is my real family, in our real home, but we are playing characters\u2026or caricatures of ourselves. Clara\u2019s Ghost takes place in one night in our family home. It\u2019s a drunken hullaballoo of an evening set against the backdrop of a traditional New England ghost story that explores the traps set by familial love\u2013the ways that unconditional attachment and intimacy can restrict us as well as set us free. The goal of casting my family and filming at our house is to bring you into the fold. I want you to feel like you are really hanging out with us, experiencing the comfortable claustrophobia that is intrinsic in being a member of the Elliott Family, the Reynolds Family, or any family really.\nPLAY\n\nChris & Paula on Letterman in '86 (edited)\nWHO ARE WE? \nThe Elliott Family has been doing comedy on TV since the 1950s. Starting with Bob Elliott, who was a prolific radio and TV star with his comedy partner, Ray Goulding. Bob and Ray had their own Broadway show, as well as their own show on NBC. Chris, Bob's son, was a tour guide in Rockefeller Center when David Letterman walked into the elevator where Chris was conducting his tour. Naturally, he hammed it up for Letterman and was soon writing and performing on \u201cLate Night with David Letterman\u201d. Also working on the show was Paula, a talent coordinator with a great set of gams. Soon the two were married, Paula quit her job and on the night that Letterman won an Emmy, their first child Abby was conceived. Three years later, Bridey, was born and the Elliott family foursome was complete. All having fought depression at one point or another, there were as many dark times as there were happy times growing up, but this only drew the family closer. As a result their sense of humor became stronger... but not smarter. To be clear, the Elliotts are not smart. If you're looking for smart, they're not right for you.\nLike the Barrymores or the Baldwins or the Obamas, The Elliotts are a family of talent and style that America looks up to, but doesn't necessarily understand just how TALENTED they really are. Clara's Ghost will finally give the family a platform and voice to whine about Hollywood, and to collect your accolades for doing so.\nBridey Elliott (writer/director) and Sarah Winshall (Producer) first met when they were two of the only female clerks working at Kim\u2019s Video & Music, New York City\u2019s most beloved video store. When both of them relocated to Los Angeles, they teamed up to create their first short film, a microbudget, character-driven comedy, Affections. The film premiered at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival and gained popularity as it played at several other film festivals nationally and internationally. It was released theatrically as part of the Sundance Shorts Tour in June of 2016, screened on the Opening Night of the Maryland Film Festival, received the Best Short Film award from the International Film Festival of Boston and the Jury Award for Best Short Film from the South Dakota Film Festival. Affections premiered online at NoBudge.com in November 2016. Clara\u2019s Ghost is their next collaboration. \nPLAY\n\nWhat people thought of Affections:\n\u201cWriter/director/star Bridey Elliott is a triple threat in this intentionally cringe-worthy comedy about a lonely and desperate young woman adrift in the City of Angels.\u201d \u2013indieWIRE\n\u201ca beautifully bittersweet comedy.\u201d \u2013The Moveable Fest\n\u201ca lighthearted [film] that finds unexpected emotional weight\u201d \u2013Filmmaker Magazine\n\"Affections is a soft-spoken musing on isolation in the modern age...This is a really beautiful film... Keep your eyes and ears open for more from Bridey Elliott, she\u2019s the real deal and primed to breakthrough.\" -Film School Rejects", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFilmmaking is by nature collaborative, and involves a lot of moving parts. But by keeping our budget modest, our cast & crew populated with trusted friends & family, and hitting the ground running to make this film, we hope to minimize those risks and rise to the challenge. \n\nAs a team we are used to working quickly with minimal means. In fact, we thrive on these restrictions! Our first film together, the short comedy \"Affections\", was made on a microbudget of $3,000. That went on to premiere at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival. If we can do a 16 minute short for $3,000, we can do a 90 minute thriller-comedy for $300,000+...\n\nEvery feature film presents a certain degree of risk and challenges. This is, for us, an especially exciting and scary prospect. It is our first feature film, and aside from the fear that \"Clara's Ghost\" will haunt our set, we also are challenged by our compulsion to make this movie be the best movie it can be. We are lucky to have a cast of seasoned actors who are so reliably talented and with invaluable advice. We will inevitably rely on their vast experience to help guide us through the unknown.\n\nAdditionally, we are lucky to have YOU, our fans. Your impeccable sense of humor and excellent taste won't falter. YOU hold us accountable to make the funniest, nuttiest, most sensitive ode to Clara we can. And with your support, we will! And of course, as we roll along, we'll keep all you posted with the latest news. If we hit any snags, we'll let you know. But you can be assured that we WILL make this movie, no matter what.

Thank you...and now a word from Derri...and Chris Taylor on stretch goals!\nSo here's how this works: If we hit $25k before the end of the campaign, everyone will receive a bonus ambient instrumental mix of the new album. This means if you pledge for a download or vinyl/download level, you'll receive the bonus ambient mix album via download as well. (We won't be pressing the ambient mix on vinyl.) If you pledge on any level that includes a CD, the ambient mix of the album will be included on CD with your order.\nIf we hit 30k before the end of the campaign, in addition to the ambient mix, everyone will receive a bonus album of covers, chosen by the fans that have pledged in the \"Song O' Matic\" level of this campaign. This also means if you pledge for a download or vinyl/download level, you'll receive the bonus covers album via download as well. (We won't be pressing the covers album on vinyl.) If you pledge on any level that includes a CD, the covers album will be included on CD with your order.\nLet's see if we can hit those stretch goals before the project wraps on June 30th!\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhen you start a record you have ideas floating around in your head about what it might sound like. I\u2019m a dreamer. I tend to think in terms of color, space and sound. Lyrical adventures that transport people to another place and time. Whenever Steve Hindalong and I would start a Choir record we would talk about what kind of record we wanted to make. I would go on about this kind of sound, that kind of vibe, and at some point Steve would always look at me and say,  \u201cShouldn\u2019t we write the songs first?\u201d Of course he was right. When I talked to Steve about this record his response was \u201cThis needs to be your voice. Your stories.\u201d So I\u2019m going to bring in my great songwriter friends and share my stories with you. I can\u2019t really say what kind of record it will be in the end but I\u2019m going to share my heart with you. I can tell you it will have a lot of moody guitars! And I can tell you that I\u2019ll give you my best. I\u2019m looking forward to all of you hearing it and sharing this journey with me. ~ Derri\nMy guess is you have questions. Hopefully we have answers....\nWill you be releasing the album on vinyl? ~ Yes, we will be pressing 250 copies of the album on 180g vinyl.  150 copies will be black, and 100 will be color. (Color tba.)  This is a one time pressing.\nWhat kind/size of T-Shirts are being used in the campaign? ~ For this campaign, our manufacturer will use pre-shrunk, 100% cotton, heavyweight Fruit Of The Loom shirts in mens sizes Small through 5XL. We will also produce the design on \"Ladies Cut\" t-shirts in sizes X-Small through 2XL.\nIf we meet the goal, how long will it be before I get my order? ~ Great question. The moment we reach goal (assuming we do), everything will go into production. Our projected schedule is that Derri will turn in a finished record in December of this year, and everything will be manufactured and shipped by April of 2017.  He will be recording the album primarily in Southern California (vs his studio in Nashville) while he also cares for his Dad, and he believes this setup will allow him to meet recording deadlines.

This has been three years of growth, change, and a whole lot of life experience. I have wrestled with fear, self-doubt, and writer's block, but I have come to the other side with music that I can't wait to share. \nThe most prominent lesson that God has taught me in this time is that his love and grace are more rich, vibrant, and colorful than I could ever imagine. \nFrom that truth comes The Color EP. \nI have never been more eager and excited to share songs before, and I need your partnership to make it happen. \nHere is what you can do. \n1. Check out all the packages under the \"rewards\" tab. Give as much as you want to give, and I will send you some pretty special things in return. More info below!  \n2. Make your pledge by clicking the green \"Back This Project\" button at the top-right. You won't be charged until the project is completed. \nTHIS IS ALL OR NOTHING. If I raise all $7,000 in 30 days, I get to make this project, you get to hear it, and we all walk away winners! If I raise any amount short of that goal, your credit card is never charged, and I never see a penny. \nWhat are you supporting? \nThe Color EP is a 5 song project. 5 songs that I have written with other wonderful songwriters who are also dear friends. 5 songs that represent universal truths that God has taught me in recent months. 5 songs that I can't wait to share. \nStylistically, this has elements of the acoustic, quirky vibe from my first EP. But this project is more mature, more developed, more sonically interesting, and more pop. \nIt is being produced by the talented Seth Penn. Seth and I have written together many times over the years, and he brings amazing creativity to the music. He is able to take the ideas in my head and make them sound even better than I imagine. \nWhat do I need? \nI need $7,000 to create this album. Here is the breakdown. \nProduction = $4,200. This goes to pay my producer, studio time, musicians, mixing and mastering. \nArtwork/Design - $100 \nCD Printing: $500 \nKickstarter cost & fees: $600\nRewards: $600\nMarketing/publicity: $1,000\n$7,000 is the base number. The bare minimum to make this happen. If we can raise even more, we will get to do even more! \nStretch goal #1: $8,500 \n$8,500 will allow us to hire a publicist and really get the word out to more people. I would love to make this happen! \nStretch goal #2: $10,000 \n$10,000 would allow us to make some awesome video content! And this benefits YOU, too! \nWe are already halfway through with the recording process. We have finished pre-production and some of the instrument tracking. Your funds are needed to finish this out and make it a reality! \nWhen is this happening?\nThe EP is scheduled to release late January or early February. More details will be coming soon! \n What are the rewards? \nFor full reward details, check out the \"Rewards\" tab. But here are a few more details on some of the fun things you could get for your donation! \nIt starts at just 5 little dollars. You can receive anything from an early download of the full album to a signed physical copy of the CD to exclusive \"bonus demo\" content to some fun merch items. \nCheck out the beautiful cover of the new EP. All photography by Sydney Goodwin Photography (www.sydneygoodwinphotography.com)\nOne of the items you could receive is an art print of one of the lyrics to my song \"Fight Your Fear.\" \nIt's an overlay of my own handwriting and a beautiful photo taken by the talented Madeleine Bonin (www.madeleinebonin.com). \nYou could also get a The Color EP mug. Photo coming soon! \nHuge shoutout to Kate Allen (www.uncommonkate.com) for helping me design the cover art, art print, and mug. \nIn Closing...\nThank you in advance for every bit of support on this project. Every bit means so much to me. \nI also ask that you pray for us as we continue to make this music. Pray that God will use these songs to affect someone in some way. \nFor more information about me and my music, visit: \nMy website \nFacebook\nInstagram \nTwitter", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith any musical project, there is potential for setbacks and delays; however, we have created built-in buffer time to make sure this is accomplished and ready to send to you in January (official release in February).

If we can reach $130,000 total on Kickstarter, the plan is to kick off the tour with our special event Nashville concert and party on April 25th (see reward #10), then cover the USA in 30 days. Unless your home is in certain sections of Montana or the Dakotas, we hope to play a show within at least a 400 mile radius of wherever you live within the Continental U.S. And for those of you living in a major metropolis, we should be a whole lot closer \u2014 maybe even within walking distance.\nWe did a quick budget for a 20 city tour, and it breaks down like this: Transportation and fuel: $20,000 / Lodging and meals: $20,000 / Crew and equipment rentals: $20,000 / Keeping the home fires lit: $25,000 (Because some of us have kids. Who love to play with matches.) / Cheeto & Trail Mix allowance: $800 / Nightly cucumber mask (to keep our youthful glow): $1,200 / Insurance: $3,000 (Peter\u2019s amazing sense of groove is insured by Lloyd\u2019s of London.) / TOTAL COST: $90,000 \nStretch Goal #2 ($150K) = Break Out The Suit. If we hit $150,000... I will wear the On The Fritz suit live onstage each night during the encore. Although the reflective glare from this suit can cause temporary blindness, know this is going to hurt me a lot more than it hurts you.\nStretch Goal #3 ($170K) = Break Out The Dress. If we hit $170,000... I BREAK OUT THE DRESS for a second encore that includes \u201cLifeboat.\u201d Those of you who have seen the \u201cLifeboat\u201d video from 1985 know that this is a very bad idea, so please save my last shred of dignity and stop giving before we reach this particular goal. \nStretch Goal #5 ($200K) = International Showtime. And what about those of you living abroad in places like Australia or New Zealand or the U.K. or the wilds of Europe? (Is Canada a foreign country?)This goal will allow us to fly economy class to your fair shores and play select international dates.\nStretch Goal #6 ($250K) = We Want To Play Latin America. Because we want to play Latin America. And even if Our Friends To The South don\u2019t want to hear us, this would allow us the abilityto rent our own venues. So there.\nDear Backers-In-Waiting,\nWhy should I tempt fate and do another Kickstarter project when the last one (\"Save Blue Like Jazz\") was so wildly successful it can never be repeated?\nBecause before I became your 11th favorite filmmaker I was your 8th favorite recording artist, and I know you've missed me making music because you wrote and told me on Facebook and why would you lie?\n\nAnd while it's true most recording artists get worse as they get older \u2014usually much worse \u2014 isn't it at least statistically possible I may have gotten better?\nYes. And here's how:\n1. Form a band with Jimmy Abegg, John Mark Painter and another longtime collaborator who was supposed to remain secret due to contractual restrictions but he/she enjoys drumming, surfing and running through photos cloaked in camo-net. Commence recording album's worth of suitable material.\n2. Write lyrics culled from two decades of Life's Rich Pageant. Judge each line harshly. Refine until satisfied.\n3. Discover to your surprise that your singing voice may have improved with age. Make note to record vocals asap before the onset of any potential throat-debilitating illness.\n4. Return to Kickstarter community with outstretched palm. Include money back guarantee. Try not to reek of desperation.\nAnd in anticipation of your frequently asked questions...\nWhat will the music sound like? \nYour favorite color + your favorite candy + rock = the sound of STATPF \nIs there a deeper meaning behind the band moniker? \n\"Steve Taylor\" sings lead vocals and writes the lyrics / \"And The Perfect Foil\" write and record the music. And yes, those four words just happen to comprise an acronym of the band members' surnames. Coincidence? Yes, actually. \nWe've been hearing about a new Steve Taylor album since the Clinton Administration. How do we know this is real?\nI've played the demos for the neighbor kids. They will confirm that 1) It's real; and 2) It's weird when a grown man asks you to listen to his demos.\nWill there be a tour?\nIt depends. Will you bring your friends?\nAren't you rich, Steve Taylor? Why don't you fund it yourself?\nI was, in fact, reasonably well off at one time from a thriving music career that included writing songs you love, singing some of them, and producing a world-wide hit that rhymes with \"Kiss Me.\" But five years into the New Millennium I developed a filmmaking habit that has required constant infusions of personal cash to the point where I can no longer fund anything beyond the occasional date night.\nBut don't you have a bank and/or rich friends who would loan you the money?\nYes, I do. And yes, they probably would. But thanks to certain principles laid out in a certain book given to me last year (authored by a certain Mr. Ramsey), I'd rather pre-sell the new album to all of you than borrow money to make it. And an even bigger reason is this: I have no idea how many people even care. Are there 100 of you? 1,000 of you? More? I can't think of a better platform than Kickstarter for finding out how many fans are interested in a new album, then expanding those plans accordingly, including whether or not it makes sense to go on tour. \nHow will the money be spent?\nRecording=$12,000 / Mixed and mastered by professionals=$10,000 / Artwork=$3,000 / Music Videos & P.R. to feed the promotional juggernaut=$7,000 / Estimated cost of backer incentives & Kickstarter fees=$8,000 / Grooming for the band photo=$1.50 / Grand Total = $40,001.50 \nWill you go back to making movies after this?\nThat's the plan, God-willing. I've even got the screenplay I'm working on open in a separate window on my laptop. But making movies is hard\u2014much harder than making music\u2014and it takes me ten times as long (3-6 years) to make a movie as it takes me to record an album (3-6 months). Is my math accurate? Plus it's almost fifty times more expensive: $1-2mil for me to make a movie vs. $30-40K for me to record an album. And yes, I just did the mental math on that last statistic, which is why you can trust me with your money.\nYour friend,\nSteve Taylor\nP.S. Some of you will want to know that the long-in-gestation Chagall Guevara live album is at the ready. My Guevarian bandmates felt it would be better to keep its release separate, so we hope to further press our luck by launching that campaign in January...\n\"Portrait of Ben Pearson\" by Jimmy Abegg\nThis just-completed Jimmy Abegg original can be yours with a simple click o' the mouse.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBarring any unforeseen hubris (I just re-read Luke 12:16-21), we hope to pull this off with minimal delays or mishaps.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #62", "update_userinfo": "Happy Thanksgiving!

Fun and laughter are guaranteed, as these two live out their dreams and hopefully learn something along the way. In front of a camera.\nWe have been given the opportunity of a lifetime: To set sail around the world with 500 other college students. The program is called Semester at Sea (http://www.semesteratsea.org) and in a nutshell, consists of 500 college students on a cruise ship for two months.\nHi, we\u2019re Riley and Dan, the nuts in the nutshell!\nOK, sure\u2026we\u2019ll be earning 9 hours of school credit while on the ship, so it\u2019s not all fun and games. But there will be fun and games. I mean, come on! It\u2019s a big boat and when the boat pulls into port at various coastal towns around the world, our only job will be to explore and experience\u2014to take it all in.\nGENIUS MOMENT\nA thought occurred to us: We need to document this. THIS IS KIND OF A BIG DEAL! We could do the typical iPhone videos and slideshows\u2026but we can do better than that. Riley has been dabbling in filmmaking since he learned to hit a red record button and has been wanting to make a documentary but hasn\u2019t been able to come up with a good subject. Ummm\u2026ok. How about 2 GUYS ON A BOAT WITH A BUNCH OF COLLEGE STUDENTS?\nHATCHING A PLAN\nWe want to take you with us. No, you can\u2019t fit in our suitcases. Maybe some of you could\u2026but there\u2019s going to be some pretty foul-smelling clothes in there. What we hope to do is create a weekly web show called \u201cTwo Guys, One Boat, and a World of Adventure\u201d which will feature our exploits and adventures from the past week. We\u2019ll pack it all in there\u2014embarrassing encounters with locals, awkward pauses, jumping off things into stuff (the \u201cthings\u201d and \u201cstuff\u201d will change from week to week, but the concept is genius, right?), learning about life in other cultures, and a highlight music video at the end of the trip. We want to take you along for the ride, make you laugh, and maybe discover some new things about people and life along with us\nTHE CATCH\nWe\u2019re college students. Read: we\u2019re broke. It's hard enough to scratch enough money together for a taco, much less pay for a 2 month Semester at Sea AND fund a documentary on top of it. Besides deferring some of the travel costs associated with a semester abroad, we also need to purchase 2 GoPro Hero HD cameras (www.gopro.com) along with all the requisite mounting devices, several 32G SD memory cards, and travel cases. Plus, to really get the best footage around these countries, we need to take as many adventure excursions as possible (scuba diving, scooter rentals, bail money, etc). \nTHE PLEA\nKickstarter is an all-or-nothing platform. We set a goal of $5,000, but if we don\u2019t reach that goal, we get nothing. Zero. Zip. Nada. However, if we reach the goal, we also get to keep anything above the goal. So really, the goal is much higher but we set our Kickstarter goal lower than we actually need. We\u2019ve come up with what we believe are some really funny and unique awards for you when you donate.\nTHE WRAP UP\nWe are two 19 year old guys living life to the fullest and living out our dreams. It\u2019s all going to be good, clean fun because we\u2019re good, clean, fun guys. We will take you with us as we travel to beautiful and amazing places, try new things, see amazing sites, and do a lot of laughing and learning in the process. Come with us as we visit Spain, Italy, Croatia, Greece, Turkey, Morocco, and Portugal. We will be updating you along the way every week, keeping you updated on the two month voyage. So help me go on this trip of a lifetime, and let me share in our experiences along the way. 2 Guys, 1 boat, and A World of Adventure.
