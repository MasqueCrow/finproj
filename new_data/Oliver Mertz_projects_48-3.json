[{"backer": "Oliver Mertz", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "BIG PROGRESSIVE IDEAS AND GORGEOUS, GONZO, GENRE COMICS\nI'm Aubrey Sitterson and if you read my previous Kickstarted comic \u2013 Tyrell Cannon and my instant classic BEEF BROS \u2013 you know what I'm all about: Joining forces with the best artists around to use outrageous, bombastic concepts to explore and ruminate on world-changing, community-based ideas. That's why, when Chris Moreno (Zombie Dickheads, World War Hulk: Front Line) decided to follow up our beloved The Comic Book Story of Professional Wrestling, we developed Stoned Master, a blend of stoner comedy, kung fu action, and sun-drenched Los Angeles vibes chockablock with anti-gentrification rumination.\nStoned Master #1 is a 32-page, full-color comic book, the first of a planned five-part series cocreated by Chris and me, with letters by Taylor Esposito and logo by Tim Daniel. You can find out more below, but first and foremost\u2026CHECK OUT HOW DOPE THIS THING LOOKS!\nTHC chocolate in your peanut butter\nBlazed Fist vs Drunken Fist\nWelcome to Chavez Heights\nHonestly: What's better than this?\n Keep on scrolling to check out our rewards, including stickers, prints,  and original art and commissions by Chris!\nGIMME THOSE DEETZ\nStoned Master is set in the fictional Los Angeles neighborhood of Chavez Heights, where the rapacious conglomerate RepCor is corporatizing and gentrifying everything in sight. And the only ones standing in their way? Burnout kung fu savant Frankie Wong, his drunken master, and his pals from the local cannabis dispensary. \nImagine Kung Fu Hustle meets Pineapple Express. Or, for the old heads, Drunken Master meets Cheech & Chong. It's all the intense, artful fight scenes you expect from a martial arts epic, combined with gut-busting stoner comedy laughs, then fully baked in the Southern California sun.\nWhile working together on The Comic Book Story of Professional Wrestling, Chris and I found ourselves jonesing for an opportunity to cut loose, free of the restrictions that come with nonfiction work. We wanted space and freedom for big, intense, outlandish action and hilarious visual comedy.\nStoned Master is our opportunity to show off, demonstrating all our strengths on a truly gonzo comic, all in service of actual good politics. With your help, we're going to make it happen, with any additional money raised spent how it rightfully should be: Paying the team more.\nCHARACTER DESIGNS\nAs part of his efforts to make Stoned Master's Chavez Heights setting feel real, authentic, and lived in, Chris put in a ton of design work, creating characters that feel unique and visually distinct while remaining authentic and familiar.\nREWARDS!\nSlap it on your bong\nDare you to hang it up at work\nSample Chris Moreno commission\nSample Chris Moreno commission\nWHAT IF YOU RAISE MORE MONEY?\n$25,000: Everybody gets raises\nIn order to make Stoned Master happen, everyone's agreed to a lower rate; Aubrey isn\u2019t taking a page rate at all! If we hit our first stretch goal, that changes, with Chris and Taylor getting raises and Aubrey getting a page rate.\n$35,000: Stoned Master #2\nThe entire five-issue Stoned Master series is outlined and we yearn to make it happen. If we pull in enough cash on this campaign, we\u2019ll be able to get a head start by funding the creative costs of issue #2!\n$45,000: Everybody gets raises\nSame as before, if we make $45,000, the entire team gets their increased rates on Stoned Master #2!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAubrey's previous Kickstarter campaign \u2013 for the leftist superhero comic BEEF BROS \u2013 saw rewards delivered safely and on time to all backers. In addition, not only is Aubrey an experienced comic book writer, but he's also a former editor at Marvel (Punisher War Journal, Ghost Rider, etc.) and Image (The Walking Dead, Invincible), so he knows a thing or two about putting together great-looking books.\n\nChris is a seasoned, 20-year comic book and animation pro, well-versed in the world of self-publishing, having written, drawn, colored, lettered and published two printings of his comic Zombie Dickheads.\n\nWe have confirmed that our printer is operating at full capacity despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We have also researched multiple shipping options in order to have back-up delivery plans in place. While additional challenges may arise, we will always be communicative and upfront with our backers about the status of our project.\n\nInternational backers: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant delays in international shipping and customs clearance.

In her mind, only a Great House has the right to such power, but who will listen to a poor Irish woman? House Lowell will. For Alice Lowell has inherited an old Puritan journal which describes how to find and enslave a demon, but she needs a psychic to do it. Kidnapping Caitlin is the first step in a plan to rid her husband\u2019s House of debt. But with a demon to do their bidding, her ambitions will be limitless.\nThe Book of Demons can be read as a standalone, but it is a continuation of Ghosts and Demons.\nFirst Three Pages:\nNEW TO BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY?\nIf you are new to the series, the original six issue mini-series is about an ex-Pinkerton detective, a spirit photographer, and a genius scientist who battle supernatural forces in late 1800\u2019s Boston. They  live in an alternate steampunk history where ghosts and demons are a normal part of life. Families known as the Great Houses control the economy of the Great States of America while the middle class and lower classes sole purpose are to serve the Great Houses.\nThe original trade paperback is available in several reward tiers.\nWHAT'S IN THE TRADE?\nI'm glad you asked. Not only does it include all six issues from the  original mini-series as well as the cover art, but it also contains a  ten page  short story called, Hunter-Killer,  and additional bonus pages.

I introduce three new characters: Gwen Warrick - Captain;  Emmet Rochester - Navigator; and Joaquin Medina - Engineer.\nThe complete sequential art version of Hunter-Killer will ONLY be available in the trade.\nWHAT ELSE IS THERE?\nOur three previous standalone sequels will be available as well. And they are:\nTHE SCOURGE OF THE MECHANICAL MEN \nSTORY: Granville and Tesla are in a race for time to save Boston from a mysterious disease that turns human beings into machines.\n\nTHE SPIRIT OF REBELLION \n STORY: Caitlin flees to Philadelphia only to discover a ghost, a rebellion, and perhaps, her destiny.\n\nGHOSTS AND DEMONS \n STORY:  A disturbing dream leads Caitlin and the team to face off with a new enemy.\nTHE BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY COLORING BOOK:\nTwenty (20) gorgeous illustrations for you to relax  and color away to your heart's content.

Inspired by fantasy and the art of storytelling,   Holly-Rosing uses her imagination to create a fantastic story that is   both well-written and fearless.\" - Valerie Complex (Fansided)\n\"If you have a taste for an intelligent, well written, elegantly   illustrated award winning independent book, you can't go wrong with   Boston Metaphysical Society!\" - Alex Yarde (The Good Man Project)\n\"This very inventive series posits a totally believable Steampunk   world that is populated by appealing characters who act (and react) in   believable manners to the extraordinary events that swirl around them.\"  -  Robert Sodaro (Comic Reviewer at Examiner.com)\nTHE STORY BEHIND THE STORY\nI love writing BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY.  Not only does it bring my  love of science fiction and history  together, (which by the way, equals  steampunk), the steampunk time  period allows me to address the themes  of classism, sexism, and racism  in America in a thoughtful and engaging  way. For at its very core,  BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY is an American  story.

This campaign is aiming to fund these two issues in order to complete what we hope will be only the first arc of a much longer series. \nPage 36 of Young Offenders! #1\nIn issue two, it's time for this make-shift team to figure out where they stand before the attack reaches earth. We'll see the urban vigilante and knife aficionado Jane teaching that spoiled rich boy Colin how to actually throw a punch, Victor stepping into the role of reluctant \"team dad\" even as his own personal life and music career is in danger of falling apart, and Elaine and Esperanza unexpectedly bonding as investigating a \"routine\" power outage puts all of them right in the villainous Hun-Came's crosshairs.\nIssue #2, page 2\nIssue three is where everything explodes after the shocking events of issue two. Villains will be confronted, reality will be altered, and our self-involved young adults... might actually take a big step into growing into their more realized selves.\nAlong the way, each issue will have a back-up dedicated to exploring the background of one of our central characters. Issue two will feature a back-up focused on armored super-teen Elaine aka Whiz Kid, and issue three will have a back-up focused on that master of caustic arts, Esperanza aka Bruja!\nIssue #2, Page 3\nCreative Team!\nWriter Mark O. Stack is a Chicano comics writer based in New Jersey who has been self-publishing comics since 2016. His work includes editing and writing the lead feature for the inclusive superhero comics magazine Weekend Warrior Comics (successfully funded on Kickstarter!) and scripting the critically acclaimed graphic novella The Scent of May Rain, the latter of which Scott Snyder (Undiscovered Country, Dark Nights: Death Metal) praised for Stack's \"ability to create a whole superhero mythology.\" He is currently writing an unannounced middle-grade graphic novel. \nIssue #2, page 4\n Artist Mike Becker is a cartoonist based in Philadelphia. After graduating from the Savannah College of Art and Design with an MFA in sequential art, Mike has been working as an independent illustrator since 2016, and recently began self-publishing his creator owned superhero webcomic, Empyrex Adventures on Instagram (@Empyrex_Adventures).\nH.E.R.C. on page 30 of #1, and page 1 of #2\nLetterer and designer Jodie Troutman is a comics creator based in Arizona.

Stack to create your own teen superhero character. You'll be able to provide Mike with your character's name and description, and he'll sketch various design possibilities. After up to three rounds of notes, you'll finalize the design with Mike and you'll get to work with Mark to create a one-page origin/introduction for your new hero!\nMike Becker's early Demon Boy sketches\nWhen you're happy with the script, Mike will draw the page traditionally and finish it digitally. You'll receive the original art for the page, sign an agreement stating your ownership of the character, and receive a high resolution file of the completed (colors and letters) page for your own personal or professional use.\nIf you'd like, we can also include the final page in Young Offenders! #3 and discuss a future appearance in a later issue with your consultation on the writing of the character. Ultimately, this character will be entirely yours! The Create Your Own Young Offender! is limited to two backers at the $1000 level.\nMike with a page of original art from Young Offenders! #1\nCreating a character that a backer will own entirely is a lot of work, but you've seen how much work we've put into this book from Mike's design work to the characterization we both strive for so we think the cost of this tier (which comes with all our other amazing rewards) will be worth it to anyone who selects it. This is a chance to create something that you'll be proud of and, if you want, spin-off into your own comic!\nAdd-On's!\nPrint copies of The Scent of May Rain, Weekend Warrior Comics #1, and Young Offenders #1.\nIn addition to the rewards offered above, you can also add-on a limited number of items after you select your pledge: \nprint copies of issues one through three! \nprint copies of The Scent of May Rain, praised by superstar comics writer Scott Snyder (Nocterra, Batman): \"The Scent of May Rain is a stunning debut.

All the scripts are written, so now we just need the funds to make sure Mike has the space to comfortably complete the work on these two issues.\nOur goal of $10,000 is largely made up of production costs (art, lettering, design, etc.) as well as printing and shipping these books to our backers.\nStretch Goals!\n $12,000: Print copies of the ongoing spin-off web serial, The Lark: Birthday Wishes by Colt Hoskins and Mark O. Stack, will be collected in print and made available to backers as an add-on as well as added to the Digital Archive tier.\n$15,000: TO BE ANNOUNCED\nShipping Schedule!\nTo clarify the release schedule of these issues, all PDF copies of Young Offenders #1 along with the Digital Archive will be sent out to backers immediately once the campaign is funded and charges have cleared. PDFs of issues two and three will be sent out to backers as they are completed in July and September, respectively. \nTo keep shipping costs down for our backers, we are planning to mail out the print copies of all issues together once #3 has been printed (with a goal of shipping no later than November), but backers can message us about paying an additional shipping charge to receive print copies of #2 (and whatever additional books/items they've selected) once they are finalized.\nI have personally run three successful Kickstarter campaigns in the last two years with very fast fulfillments. My latest campaign to reprint The Scent of May Rain was printed and shipped to backers within weeks of me receiving the Kickstarter funds.

Well here's a chance to see all the nuts and bolts of how one is put together...\n My name is Declan Shalvey, an award winning artist/writer from Ireland. I've been a freelance artist for over 10 years working for publishers such as Marvel and DC Comics on characters such as Moon Knight, Wolverine, Batman, Hulk and many more. I have also developed creator owned projects at Image comics, on books such as Injection, Savage Town and Bog Bodies.\n\nTIME BEFORE TIME is my latest creator owned series, debuting May 12th. The series begins in the year 2140, and to escape that world with no future, many turn to the  Syndicate, a criminal organization who, for the right price, will  smuggle you back in time to a better life. After working for the  Syndicate for years, out main characters Tatsuo and Oscar decide to steal one of their  boss\u2019s time machines\u2014but soon find that the one thing you can\u2019t run from  is your past.\n\nThis series is a new ongoing image series from myself and the creative team behind the recent and excellent WRITE IT IN BLOOD graphic novel. The Final Order Cutoff (FOC) to order #1 is soon; April 19th. To celebrate this new project, I'm doing something a little different... I want to pull back the curtain on the creation of an original series, for process junkies everywhere.      \n TIME BEFORE TIME: Process Edition is a 48 page process book, about making the new Image series, revealing the creative process behind developing the first issue of the series.  This is not the Image comic book that will be in comic stores; this is a book about how the comic was made. It's a rare opportunity to see all the raw elements of a comic develop into a finished piece of work.\nWhy Kickstarter? Well, this is an experiment for me, I've often been told that I should make some process projects though I haven't been sure how to release them. I also felt a companion process book would be a great way to dig deep into process material in a way that wouldn't be possible in a regular comic or trade collection.

The bodies will mount, loyalties will be tested and no one will come out of the bush unscathed.\nCreative duo Matthew Soall (Weird Crap in Australia Vol. 1) and Ignacio Di Meglio (Hyper Epics: The Ace, Body and Soule, The Last Battle, Graphic Mundi: Covid Chronicles and Critical Role sizzle reel: Strength) offers a forty-eight page, full-colour comic telling one complete story. Matthew has incorporated real-world locations informed by research conducted for the Weird Crap in Australia podcast to give the book a conspiratorial flare, while Ignacio breathes new life into the Australian bush and presents KILLEROO like you have never seen him before.\nThere's also a definite influence of the classic film PREDATOR, which is one of our favourite films.\nKILLEROO: SEMPER FI will reward long-time readers with a brand new adventure, while introducing new readers to Australia's favourite indie comic marsupial in all his brutal glory.\n\n\nNot only do we have a great cover for the book by Ignacio, but we're very lucky to have an awesome alternate cover by one of my mentors, Jason Badower (fresh off his run on JOKER/HARLEY: CRIMINAL SANITY from DC Comics!) - how cool is that!\n\nIgnacio has made a solid start on the book, having drawn the first 5 pages and several key battle sequences already. He has also adapted his style for this book, adopting a heavy blacks and texture style with a strong colour palette. Take a look:\n\nIf you've never heard of Killeroo before, he is an Australian comics character, created by myself (Darren Close) way back in 1995. \nI have since published over a dozen comic books about him, working with some of the best writers and artists in Australia and abroad.\nHe is a kangaroo/human hybrid created by the Australian military in a secret facility back in the 1970s. Bred to be the ultimate soldier for the harsh Australian outback, for a war that never happened. Since he escaped that facility (and termination), he has formed a bond with the Aboriginal community, and is often found fighting for them and the environment against the destructive encroachment of industry and corporations.\nTo the general public, he is a myth - something akin to Bigfoot or the Loch Ness monster. This is because few of those who encounter him live to tell about it.\n\n\nWe're looking to finance a brand new 48-page full colour comic book.\nGetting an artist of Ignacio's calibre for a project like this isn't easy, and can't really be done without some assistance to pay his page rates. So while he was gracious enough to produce the sample pages you can see here, payment is needed to complete the rest of the book. That's why this project has a larger goal than I've sought for previous campaigns, to make sure both the artist (and the writer) are properly compensated for the work they've done.\nI've also structured the campaign so that they will receive a significant percentage of the funds raised if we exceed our target. So the more funds I can generate, the better the deal for them as creators. Because they deserve it.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe've partnered with some other great kickstarter campaigns running right now, which means if you back both this campaign and theirs, you get some extra goodies!\n\nDustin Brunell's GREED\n\nBen Slabak's AHMOSE Book 1 \nOur second double-backer print comes with the newly launched GORILLA MY DREAMS campaign from Big Tim Stiles. This one gets you two DIFFERENT prints - a colour one by Ignacio, and a B&W piece by Samir Simao!\n\nAdd-ons are a new feature to Kickstarter, and they work by enabling you to choose some extra items to add to your pledge, after you've selected the reward you want. \nYou can add other Killeroo comic books, t-shirts, and even slabbed and graded editions of this comic. Take a look at the full selection below:\nDIGITAL ADD-ONS:\nPHYSICAL ADD-ONS:\n\n One of the signature components of my Kickstarter campaigns is the extra goodies you get, for the more funding generated! So if you help to spread the word about this campaign, you'll reap the extra rewards!\n There's a bunch more physical rewards to be unlocked over the next few weeks! \n\n\nMATTHEW SOALL / WRITER\nMatthew is a co-host of the Weird Crap in Australia podcast and co-author of the companion novels Weird Crap in Australia Vol.1 and Vol. 2 (Vol. 2 releasing in September 2021). Raised on a healthy diet of aliens, superheroes, and serial killers, he developed an undying passion for all things pop-culture, paranormal and macabre.\nMatt currently lives in Queanbeyan, New South Wales, writing, working, and producing podcasts with his creative partner and wife, Holly Soall, while executive cat producers Talia and Joker constantly mock him for procrastinating.\n\nIGNACIO DI MEGLIO / ARTIST\nIgnacio Di Meglio has been a freelance cartoonist for more than a decade and has been drawing and telling stories for as long as he can remember. He has made comics, illustrations, and character designs for a variety of projects.

He has also produced several autobiographical stories to critical acclaim, his Ledger Award-nominated STRUGGLE book was named Best Original Comic Book of 2015 by ComicOz.\nHOLLY SOALL / SCRIPT EDITOR\nButcher by day, author by night, Holly spends her days off writing, playing in her garden and watching superhero cartoons. Holly lives with her husband Matthew and her cats Talia al-Kitty and The Joker, in a two-bedroom flat crammed with comics, video games, books and movie memorabilia.\nHolly is the researcher and co-host on the Weird Crap in Australia podcast, which releases every Monday on all good podcasting platforms. \n\n\nThe Kickstarter Campaign: 30 Days (April 1 - April 30)\nRemaining 30 pages completed (May 1 - September 1)\nShipping Survey Goes Out (September)\nBook Goes to Printer: (mid-September)\nDigital Rewards Released: (mid-September)\nShipping & Delivery to Australian Backers (October)\nExpected delivery to International Backers - (late October)\n\n\nNothing is more important than getting your goods to you in perfect condition!\nWe've been making comics and doing mail orders for decades, so we make sure to make our packaging just about bullet-proof. Not only do we bag and board our books, but we also make use of bubble-wrap, hard cardboard backing and waterproof envelopes.\nThe shipping costs are a little more expensive because we also insist on parcel tracking, so we can make sure that your books are delivered as quickly and safely as possible.\n\nFor those who are looking for a more technical outlook on where their money is going when backing this project, here is a pie graph and percentage breakdown. The second graph shows how funds generated after reaching target goal will be distributed.\n\n\nThis is the third Kickstarter campaign I've run, the first being just a few months ago, which was frankly a HUGE success - hitting almost $17k in total, a staggering 676% of the $2500 I was asking for.\nNot only that, but it took less than two months for everyone to receive their kickstarter pledges and rewards. And when I say rewards, there was a LOT of swag thanks to all the unlocked stretch goals!\nBut don't take my word for it, hear it from Corey Wyer who backed it:\nThe second Kickstarter campaign I ran was a full colour edition of the Killeroo origin story. While a smaller campaign, it still reached a total of over $6.2k in total, being 249% of the target goal.\nI've just completed fulfilment for that second campaign last month, getting books to backers several weeks earlier than I had originally planned.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the third Kickstarter campaign that I have run, and I have been self-publishing comic books for over 20 years - so I know what I'm doing.

I won't see any money myself until the target goal has been surpassed, so I'm not looking to make this a big money-making exercise - I just want to get the book printed and into the hands of Killeroo fans. There's also a generous royalty payment built into the campaign, so once it surpasses the target goal, an extra 50% will go to the creators onboard.\n\nI've also included enough to cover the Kickstarter fees and any other transactional fees and charges.\n\nLastly, I have made sure that all shipping costs include individual item tracking, to ensure that when the book leaves my hands, this will make sure that it gets into yours as soon as possible.\n\nThank you!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge AU$ 9 or more", "title": "DIGITAL COMIC", "descp": "Get the digital version of the comic, emailed to you upon completion.\nINCLUDES:\nComic (digital PDF)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}], "stat": ["90 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 20 or more", "title": "COMIC", "descp": "Get the comic book (your choice of cover), the digital PDF, and all unlocked stretch goal rewards.\nINCLUDES:\nComic (choice of cover)\nComic (digital PDF)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["137 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 40 or more", "title": "COMIC COMBO", "descp": "Get both covers for the book, the digital PDF, and all unlocked stretch goal rewards.\nINCLUDES:\nComic (cover A)\nComic (cover B)\nComic (digital PDF)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["36 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 55 or more", "title": "TRIPLE COMBO", "descp": "Get all 3 covers for the book (including the new homage cover), the digital PDF, and all unlocked stretch goal rewards.\nINCLUDES:\nComic (cover A)\nComic (cover B)\nCOMIC (homage cover)\nComic (digital PDF)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["10 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 75 or more", "title": "T-SHIRT COMBO", "descp": "Get yourself a Kickstarter exclusive t-shirt (your choice of size and colour) and a copy of the comic book (your choice of cover).\nINCLUDES:\nT-shirt\nComic (choice of cover)\nComic (digital PDF)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["20 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 75 or more", "title": "QUAD COMBO", "descp": "Get all FOUR covers A, B, C & D.\nAlso gets you the PDF Bundle of 12 bonus comics (an extra $11 in value), and the Digital PDF\nINCLUDES:\nComic (cover A)\nComic (cover B)\nCOMIC (homage cover)\nComic (cover D homage)\nPDF Bundle (12 DIGITAL COMICS)\nComic (digital PDF)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["6 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 90 or more", "title": "COMIC & SKETCH", "descp": "Get yourself an A5 original sketch, all the way from Argentina!

Her writing has a Neil Gaiman quality,  storytelling infused with a playful whimsy overlying a deeper sadness  that begs for a resolution...\" -Newsarama\nIf you're a fan of cult Halloween classics like Coraline or The Nightmare Before Christmas, you will fall in love with the hauntingly lovely Nenetl of the Forgotten Spirits.\nThis graphic novel is a Limited Edition Exclusive and it will collect all 4 completed issues + extra art in a beautiful hardcover book, with an all-new cover by our precious and talented Laura M\u00fcller. The book will be 8in x 11in (quite a bit larger than the original issues), 92 full-color pages printed on a lithograph, and if the stretch goal is achieved, it will sport a UV spot lamination on the cover! After this Kickstarter is finished and the books are sold out, Second Edition will have fewer special features, so if you're a collector this Kickstarter is the only way to get this edition of Nenetl of the Forgotten Spirits!\nNenetl of the Forgotten Spirits is a spirited horror story about a ghost searching for her family during the festival of the Day of the Dead, while dodging ambitious young exorcists. Vera Greentea (Grimoire Noir, My Parallel Life) and artist Laura M\u00fcller create an autumn-friendly tale of skulls and hope.\nEvery year, Mexican families gather to celebrate and welcome back the souls of the dead. They decorate graveyards with marigolds and introduce their beloved spirits to their children. But when the dead ones are forgotten, their spirits are never seen again. Until one early morning on the Day of the Dead, the shroud between our worlds were opened long enough to let one forgotten spirit out\u2026\nWhen the lost forgotten soul of Nena discovers that she is out in the Living Realm, she makes it her mission to find a single living person who might remember her and invite her to the festival of the Day of the Dead every year. But things aren't so simple, and while she has a full day to find that person (the span of the festival), she is also hunted by several ambitious exorcists who know that she shouldn't be in the Living Realm. \na page from Nenetl of the Forgotten Spirits\nVera Greentea writes spooky fantasies for kids and grown-ups. She's best known for GRIMOIRE NOIR (a YALSA Great Graphic Novel of 2020) and her Victorianpunk series Recipes for the Dead. You can find her comics at her website greenteapublishing.com.\nLaura M\u00fcller (aka Laumii) is a fulltime concept artist from Germany with a passion for visual development and children's books. She is currently developing her gorgeous work on the German fairy tale MOTHER HULDA. You can find more of her art at https://www.artstation.com/laumii/profile. \nOur lively Kickstarter campaign will be up from March to April, during which time  we hope to collect enough money to pay Laura for her marvelous comics and cover work, print the book and ship it to you cheery Halloween and spooky fans, as well as the usual heres-and-theres (aka Kickstarter fees, buying  packaging supplies, all relevant merchandise, ISBN &  barcodes, etc.). This is going to be Greentea Publishing's first Hardcover graphic novel, of beautiful quality in full-color and large font format. We are spending everything we make on this beautiful book! As always, we will certainly and proudly be using an American printer to save on any damages to the environment. \nWhile we are concentrating on making the most beautiful book we can, we are adding some adorable extras that will be only available with this Kickstarter!\nEveryone who orders the hardcover will also receive 2 special gifts; a beautiful Greentea Publishing/Nenetl bookmark and a Kickstarter exclusive Ex Libris sticker, onto which you can write your name and stick to the book. This way, unlike our dear little Nena, your book will never be lost or forgotten.\nA Note for Acknowledgements: If you've been acknowledged in one of the previous issues of Nenetl, there will be a page for \"those who have helped us along the way.\".

Don\u2019t let its  self-published status fool you; this book is as good as any published by  a larger press, and has a ton of heart behind it...\" -Hidden Gems:  Panels on Pages\n\n\"...Nenetl of the Forgotten Spirits fits right in  with independents like Yi Soon Shin, the works coming out of India that  focus on the Hindu Gods, and some of the more interesting comic books  coming out of Denmark and Finland. There is a large tradition to uphold  here, and Nenetl of the Forgotten Spirits does so brilliantly.\" -Comics  Forge\n\"...Cute characters interact in a world of magic tinged with  just a little darkness, capturing the playfulness of Halloween... I  admire anybody that can create this kind of dark material in a package  that children can also enjoy, and there\u2019s something decadent and creepy  about Nenetl of the Forgotten Spirits.\" -Starbust Magazine\n\n\"...Laura  and Vera have also really worked on a stylistic flair to her characters  who are individual, quirky and have a dash of cheekiness in each panel.  It\u2019s got sequential motion that\u2019s ever whirling through from panel to  panel. Just darn cute as well.\" -downthetubes\n\"...I absolutely  loved the artwork in this book, which reminded me of an excellently  animated film and really immerses the reader in a world of magical  realism.\" -Whatcha Reading?", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGreentea Publishing has now been creating projects on Kickstarter for over 7 years.

Especially C\u00e1ssia Costa.\nAn ancient cult and their army of demons have stolen C\u00e1ssia\u2019s home, Apex City.  When a magical dragon bracelet rockets into her life and affixes itself to her arm, C\u00e1ssia\u2019s the only person equipped to stop the cult from offering the entire city to their dark lord.\nThere's just one catch...\nInferno Girl Red by Nicola Scott (w/ Annette Kwok), left, and Valeria Favoccia, right\nThe magical bracelet is powered by belief, and C\u00e1ssia \u2014 an intensely pragmatic, rational girl \u2013 doesn\u2019t have much to spare. She\u2019ll have to find something to kindle her faith, though, and fast \u2014because she has a secret legacy to live up to. Because her mother's life is on the line. And because Apex City needs Inferno Girl Red.\nHi! My name's Mat Groom. And this story, INFERNO GIRL RED, is one I\u2019ve been working on for about three years now. I\u2019ve always thought it was worthwhile, but I was never certain it would work\u2026 until I met Erica D\u2019Urso. Erica is just wickedly talented. You can see that in her work on JAMES BOND, CAPTAIN MARVEL and XENA: WARRIOR PRINCESS. But it was her energy, her tremendous passion, that made me believe. Erica loves C\u00e1ssia, and C\u00e1ssia\u2019s world\u2026 and that love infuses every part of this project. There\u2019s nobody I would rather be co-creating this world with.\n\nInferno Girl Red Character Design\nTogether with colorist Igor Monti (who has a ultra-modern and vibrant style you'll recognise if you read MEGA MAN: FULLY CHARGED), letterer Becca Carey (a real star-in-the-making) and design agency For The People (a Top 10 Global Agency, according to D&AD), Erica and I are so excited to bring you this all-new 100-page superhero graphic novel.\nINFERNO GIRL RED Creative Team\nKyle Higgins is editing this book. Kyle and I have been friends for half a decade, at this point. He has mentored me, in many ways (he edited my first comics series SELF/MADE), and more recently we\u2019ve worked as a writing team on ULTRAMAN for Marvel Comics. We share a passion for the Japanese tokusatsu genre (which was a big influence here, along with British boarding school dramas and American superhero comics). And there\u2019s little coincidence that C\u00e1ssia was first introduced to the world in the back of the first issue of Kyle\u2019s series, RADIANT BLACK. In fact, the connections between RADIANT BLACK and INFERNO GIRL RED may run deeper than you think\u2026\nC\u00e1ssia\u2019s not shy\u2013 but bouncing around from city-to-city as her Mom bounced from job-to-job meant it was hard to make friends... and any friends she did make disappeared pretty quickly once they found out who C\u00e1ssia\u2019s mother was. So instead of socialising, she focused on learning\u2013 showing a particular aptitude for science.\n\nC\u00e1ssia Costa Character Design\n \n                     Now C\u00e1ssia has a chance for a fresh start in Apex City. Her impressive test scores have earned her an invitation to the world-famous entrepreneur Doctor Janine Caro\u2019s prestigious boarding school for promising young minds. There, C\u00e1ssia starts to settle in. She starts to make friends. She starts to see a future for herself.\nBut when a magical bracelet blasts through a window while C\u00e1ssia is studying late one night, everything changes. C\u00e1ssia's quickly drawn into a strange war that she previously only heard about from her mother... \nConcept Art \u2013 The Griffin and Other Manifestations of Darkness\nConcept Art \u2013 C\u00e1ssia's Mom, and Other Mentors\nConcept Art \u2013 New Friends\n\nReady to experience some of the story?

Winter Solstice. \nBefore the soda drinking bears, before the bright red suit, and before the litany of saccharine films & music that saturate every holiday season, there was cold and night and fear.  \nCover Image by Donna Black, Yule Logo by LetterSquids\nThis collection of short horror comics will examine Yule, Winter Solstice, Saturnalia, and a slew of other terrifying folklore from around the world, from well-known tales of Krampus to the lesser-known Mari Lwyd, and all the bizarre traditions in between. \nArt by Meredith McClaren\nTHE TEAMS\nContributing to this book is an all-star lineup of talent, with each team producing tight-and-terrorizing tales based on 14 different pieces of worldwide folklore:\nMARI LWYD from Justin Jordan and Val Halhovorson \nKRAMPUS from Umar Ditta, Elliot Balson, Mike Maynard, and Rob Jones \nKARANKONCOLOS from Frankee White, Fell Hound, and DC Hopkins \nBELSNICKEL from Dillon Gilbertson and Matt Battaglia \nCAGA TIOS from Heather Vaughan and Jason Piperberg \nSMEE from Malissa White and Anastasia Longoria \nELF ON THE SHELF from Kacey Flynn and J Schiek \nHANS TRAPP from Alex Schlitz and Grant Stoye \nMIDNIGHT SPEECH from Meredith McClaren \nTOES from Jack Foster \nGRYLA from Ian Mondrick and Kam White  \nHUITZILOPOCHTILI from Jarred Lujan and Gregery Miller \nSATURNALIA from Joe Corallo and Elena Gogou \nPERCHTEN from Jenn St Onge \nLogo Design by LetterSquids \nCover Art by Donna Black \nLettering and Book Design by Toben Racicot \nForeword by Heather Antos \nWe'll also have incredible pin-up pieces from Minerva Fox, Marie Wolf, and Marie Enger.\n\nBUDGETING\nThe $15,000 goal is the largest I've ever pursued, but it is to meet the compensation that each creator involved deserves: $9,000 will be going directly to the teams that made this book, with around $4,500 going to printing and shipping.

We're honored and humbled by your support, and can not wait to put this groovy tale in your hands. \nFor the latest please follow:\nHeroTomorrow.com\nHero Tomorrow Facebook\nInstagram.com/tedsikora \nTwitter.com/tedsikora\nThe year is 1969. Ramsey is an aspiring comic book artist who is trying to find inspiration for his femme fatale. When he meets wild dancer, Regina, at a street fair he invites her into the woods for a character photoshoot where she begins to break on through to the other side. Witness the psycho-delic origin of the most powerful character in the Hero Tomorrow Comics universe. A mind-bending 4 issue journey to reshape your reality!\nSecond issue 32 pages full color, glossy paper.\nAll physical orders will include a signed Regina print by Ted Sikora. This is the second of four to accompany each release created in an Andy Warhol homage style.\nShipping in June 2021.\nSurvey will give you option to have them signed for FREE.\nExclusive Publisher variants not available elsewhere.\nAll four issues of this series will release in 2021.\nTed Sikora (writer/creator/colorist/letterer) is a Cleveland/Akron based comic book writer and filmmaker. He is the president of Hero Tomorrow Comics, and the creator/writer/letterer of Tap Dance Killer andPunchline & the Vaude-Villains, and creator/co-writer/colorist/letterer of Apama The Undiscovered Animal. As a filmmaker he directed the indie feature Hero Tomorrow and  hundreds of shorts in realms of documentary, music videos, and  education. He wrote the libretto, principle music and lyrics for the  horror show musical Nothing Like Vaudeville. \nButch Mapa (artist) is a professional illustrator and graphic novelist with a decade of experience, currently illustrating Marvel's Action Avengers through IDW, He's done work for Zenescope, Top Shelf, Image, Upper Deck, and many others.\nWhy Crowdfunding?\nFirst, there's nothing better than having a direct connection to  readers. I'm honored to have had that experience through conventions and  Kickstarter over the past decade. Some of the most touching moments in  my life have come from people telling me they see themselves in a  character that I created. Also the interaction online with you helps  shape these campaigns. It undoubtedly makes me a better creator, which  hopefully  enhances the experience for you with each go 'round.\nSecondly, BLOOM was actually solicited in the Previews Guide catalog in April of 2020, but due to the massive covid shutdown, that  particular catalog was barely distributed. We had to pull it because it  would have had no chance. Our business model relies heavily on comic  conventions, and without cons we would simply lose money on every  release. The Kickstarter platform is like a virtual comic con, and we can do things on it we can't even do at conventions. (like pick your shirt color and CGCs.)\nAs the industry changes we're trying to change with it.  I heartily  thank you for supporting the indies and making this moment possible.\nThank you so much for checking out our campaign.\nTed Sikora \n PREVIEW PAGES\nThe Bloom #1 campaign has a preview of the first eight pages of the series. I'm still coloring issue #2. Here's some new ones: \n\nSTRETCH & MILESTONE REWARDS\n $5000 Unlocked (Interior pinup by Pietro)\n 200 Backers (Unlocked) Super #6 PDF from Unlikely Heroes & Oxymoron The Loveliest Nightmare #1 PDF from Comix Tribe)\n $7000  (Unlocked} Interior Pinup by Fabio Nahan \n 250 Backers (Unlocked) Apama #9 PDF (Featuring a certain psychedelic guest star)\n $9000 (Unlocked) Staunch Ambition #1 PDF \n 300 Backers (Unlocked) Regina #1 4\" Sticker Bong Dazo \nBong Dazo Issue #1 four Inch Sticker Unlocked\n $10,000 (Locked) Regina #2 4# Sticker Benito Gallego \nBenito Gallego Four Inch Sticker Locked\n 393 Backers (Locked) Why 393? This would break our previous Kickstarter backer record. If we do that, ALL physical backers will receive a bonus PHYSICAL surprise comic back issue from the Hero Tomorrow Comics library. Digital backers will get a digital surprise back issue too.\nDigital stretch and milestone rewards will be given to all backers ($5 and over) at campaign's conclusion.

So, essentially, you're now getting about 16+ comics for this one pledge.\nTHE JUMP is a comic book series from screenwriter Rylend Grant, artist Fabio Alves, colorist Edson Ferriera, and letterer HdE... the same twisted team that brought you Action Lab: Danger Zone's critically-lauded superhero noir BANJAX. Banjax was nominated for FOUR Mike Wieringo Comic Book Industry Awards in 2020 including BEST SERIES (along-side BITTER ROOT, SOMETHING'S KILLING THE CHILDREN, & BLACK HAMMER: AGE OF DOOM).\nThe first Issue of THE JUMP - launched via Kickstarter last year - received RAVE reviews. This campaign will fund the pulse-pounding second issue and hopefully we'll hit a few stretch goals along the way so we can give you more bang for your Kickstarter buck.\nAfter a series of crippling personal tragedies, Thomas Northrope retreats from his everyday life and finds comfort in an online community dedicated to the art of astral projection. When he demonstrates a unique aptitude for the practice, Thomas becomes the target of a mysterious corporate/political machine \u2013 known as AJAX \u2013 bent on using promising young practitioners to win a centuries-old war on the astral plane.\nAstral projection is the process of willfully separating one's consciousness from his or her physical body and moving it freely through the universe/the astral plane. A key philosophical concept in many Eastern cultures and religions, astral projection is regularly practiced by yogis and by devotees of certain Hindu & Buddhist sects.\nAstral projection can happen spontaneously \u2013 like in near-death experiences \u2013 or it can be made to occur with practiced conscious effort. During projection, people have reported flying, passing through solid objects, seeing into the past and future, communicating with the deceased, and visiting far away planets.\nThe astral plane is a division of existence postulated by classical (particularly neo-Platonic), medieval, oriental, and esoteric philosophies and mystery religions. It is a dimension beyond the physical\u2026 the realm of dreams, spirits, and psychic phenomena, the substance and vehicle for contact between the material and the mystical. Some writers/philosophers conflate this realm with heaven and/or hell, with union with God itself.\nIn the world of The Jump, the astral plane amounts to psychic real estate\u2026 another proverbial mound of dirt to be carved up, claimed, and fought over by politicians, influential businessmen, and the cultural & religious elite.\nFROM RYLEND: I\u2019m a screenwriter by trade. For over a decade, I\u2019ve made my living writing smart psychological thrillers for directors like JJ Abrams, Ridley Scott, Justin Lin, John Woo, Luc Besson, and F. Gary Gray, so I can\u2019t help but think of things in cinematic terms. The Jump is a smart, high-concept sci-fi thriller full of meaty twists and turns. It is Inception meets The Bourne Identity\u2026 if it were dripping with macabre and directed by David Fincher. Now tell me that doesn\u2019t sound cool?\nNot ready to make THE JUMP with us just yet? Well, then check out this free preview of Issue 2:\nI know what you're all thinking now. \"That was BADASS, but what do we get if we pledge?\" Well, I'm glad you asked. First, there's--\nWe print THE JUMP on a heavy 80 lb paper stock with a 100 lb glossy cover. Top quality, all the way. When you pick up one of our books, you'll feel the difference. This is very much a Cadillac. A heavier stock also makes the comic less likely to be damaged in transit.\n\nTHE REGULAR COVER - ALVES & FERREIRA\nWe're also offering three UBER-limited variant covers you'll only be able to procure here on Kickstarter. Feast your eyes on these:\n\nB2TF HOMAGE VARIANT - ALVES & FERREIRA\nTrust us... this one's heavy... and if our calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 mph, you're gonna see some serious shit.\n\nMANDO HOMAGE VARIANT - ALVES & FERREIRA \nYou can run from this cover... but you'll only die tired.\n\nMAGNUM P.I. VARIANT - ALVES & FERREIRA \nBetter snatch this pretty little thing up before Higgins releases the Dobermans.\n\nGREAT covers, right? Having trouble choosing just one? Well, why not GRAB THEM ALL?!\nDid you miss out on Issue 1 of THE JUMP? No worries! We've got you! All four Issue 1 covers are still available (Regular cover and the Ghostbusters, Ice Cube/\"Good Day,\" & Risque variants) RIGHT HERE!\nFor more info on the Issue 1 covers, check out the ISSUE 1 KICKSTARTER PAGE.\nNOTE: Special \"Early Bird\" tiers are available for ONLY the first 48 HOURS of the campaign.

ALL backers of this Kickstarter will essentially receive THREE badass comic issues for the price of one AND...\nA MEATY PREVIEW OF THE PEACEKEEPERS #1\nAgain, we're still getting to know each other here... so why not check out our last book/the book that just took Kickstarter by storm?

These are A5 format (roughly 6x8 inches) and feature characters from THE JUMP. \n\nORIGINAL ART - B&W COMMISSION FROM FABIO ALVES \nGot something you want drawn? Well, then why not commission JUMP/BANJAX artist Fabio Alves (2020 Ringo Nominee for BEST COVER ARTIST) to draw you an original B&W pin up? You pick the subject matter.\n\nORIGINAL ART - FULL COLOR COMMISSION\nGot something you want drawn? Fabio will still do it, but why not go the extra mile and have your piece rendered in full, beautiful color by JUMP/BANJAX Colorist Edson Ferreira (2020 Ringo Nominee for BEST COLORIST)?

We starting building out this set (we made cards 1-3) during the Peacekeepers 1 & 2 campaign and they were a big hit. Score three more bonkers (cards 4-6) here!.\n-STRETCH GOAL #2 - $16,000 - (to be revealed)\nTHE JUMP has sprung from the wicked minds of Hollywood screenwriter/Ringo Award-winning comic creator Rylend Grant, artist Fabio Alves, colorist Edson Ferreira, and letterer HdE... the very same team that brought you the dark and decidedly wicked superhero noir BANJAX (published Action Lab: Danger Zone).\nBANJAX made over a dozen ten-best lists in 2019, it was nominated for FOUR Mike Weiringo Comic Book Industry Awards (including BEST SERIES) and the critics raved:\n\u201cThis is the most amazingly well done first issue of a series I have ever seen. Point blank. Period\u2026 You cannot read this and come out if the same way you went into it\u2026 So effin\u2019 good.\u201d (Steven Leitman, Reading with a Flight Ring)\n\u201cBanjax has all the action, violence, grit, and heart of a classic.\u201d (David Pepose, Creator of Spencer & Locke)\n\u201cQuality, engrossing material embedded with a cinematic feel. Gifted storytelling and breathtaking artwork. Banjax will instantly have you screaming for more!\u201d (Jason Bennett, PopCultHQ)\n\u201cBanjax hits incredibly hard. Intense, thought-provoking, wildly entertaining. It\u2019s near perfect. For those looking for something unique, Issue #1 is a must-read.\u201d (Charlie Chipman, The Brazen Bull)\n\u201cRiveting. Refreshing. Heart-breaking. Ultra-violent. Honestly, a bit unsettling. The artwork of F\u00e1bio Alves is everything a dark and gritty comic should embody. Edson Ferreira\u2019s color work adds an extra punch to really emotional panels. Don\u2019t miss out on this bloody good time! A+\u201d (Andrew Huard, You Don\u2019t Read Comics)\n\u201cHoly crap this is good. This book hits all the right notes. It\u2019s marvelously done, such a compelling story. It\u2019s the best comic I\u2019ve read in a long time. Honestly? Bendis could take some notes here.\u201d (ComicCast Podcast)\n\nAnd Rylend's previous book - ABERRANT - won a prestigious Mike Wieringo Comic Book Award (\"Ringo Award\") in 2019 for BEST VILLAIN and was nominated for two others... BEST SINGLE ISSUE and BEST WRITER (alongside Jeff Lemire, Scott Snyder, Brian K. Vaughn, and Brian Michael Bendis).\nAnd here's what the critics had to say about ABERRANT:\n\u201cGo home, other comics people. Rylend Grant and Zsombor Huszka just killed the game\u2026\u201d (Charles Pulliam-Moore \u2013 i09)\n\u201cABERRANT offers an intense, near-cinematic reading experience that incites excitement and inspires interest for issues to come.\u201d (The Brazen Bull)\n\u201cAberrant flat-out works. You have visceral action scenes. Personalities practically ooze out of the page. Honestly, this is the kind of storytelling that the big publishers are missing.\u201d (Big Comic Page)\n\u201c\u2026a bleak, dangerous and serious story with a lot at stake\u2026. If you like revenge tales, military thrillers, and superheroes, \u2018Aberrant\u2019 has it all.\u201d (Spartantown)\n\u201cABERRANT #1 is a game-changer at Action Lab: Danger Zone. You\u2019ll become captivated almost immediately\u2026 The creative team put together one of the most seamless, cohesive, and dynamic collaborations I\u2019ve seen this year on the indie scene.\u201d (PopCultHQ)\n And ABERRANT was quickly optioned for television by 24 & FELICITY Executive Producer Tony Krantz! \nAnd our last Kickstarter effort, THE PEACEKEEPERS, took the site by storm... \n\"THE PEACEKEEPERS is going to make everyone on the indie scene step up their game. This is some next-level s*** that is destined to be snagged by Hollywood. The theatrical feel, the brilliant delivery, the character development, and the remarkable comic book experience you\u2019ll get \u2013 THE PEACEKEEPERS is going to make a lot of new fans, impress current fans, and is destined for a lot more than we can possibly know. You want greatness, look no further.\" (Jason Bennett - PopCultHQ)\nMUCH MORE LOVE TO COME ON THE JUMP!\n\nAs you can see THE JUMP was put together by one hell of a team, guys whom have already been around the block a few times together... joining us this go round, though, is an army of astral projectionist gurus \u2013 shepherds of the real-life communities upon which the one in our book is modeled. While we work to make sure The Jump appeals to a hungry American action thriller audience, these folks will be making sure we keep things authentic, grounded, and true to the astral traveler\u2019s experience.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTHE JUMP is brought to you by a team of steadily working professionals that has collaborated previously and delivered an exceptional, critically-acclaimed, Ringo Award-nominated book.

This book is a full color 36 page story and the black & white artwork without word bubbles or other distractions. There will also be back-matter explaining the world of War Priest and more!\nThis story is a love letter to every creator and story that has ever excited me. You may see something that reminds you of something you love too!\n\nChapter 1:\nWar Priest is a story for anyone who likes swords and sorcery, monster hunting, dystopian futures or anything action packed with a little thought provocation.\nIn the distant future, North America has changed in every conceivable way. Several separate nations have been formed and Kingsland is one of them. Kingsland is a Theocratic/martial nation ruled by High Father Solomon III. King Solomon was divinely chosen to rule and has taken Solomon as his name. The nation is divided into 12 Wards and each is ruled by a War Priest who answers directly to the High Father. Each War Priest is chosen by the High Father and takes the name of an Apostle of Jesus.\nMatthias is the War Priest this story focuses on. (Matthias was the Disciple chosen by the other 11 after Judas Iscariot betrayed Jesus.)\nHe is sent to the 9th Ward in search of its War Priest, Thomas.\nWhat he finds may change everything...\n\nWar Priest: Enhanced Edition Chapter One\nPage 1\nPage 2\nPage 3\nPage 4\nPage 5\nWhat are people saying?\n\"It\u2019s a gruesome, bloody brawl from beginning to end, and it\u2019s wondrous to read. It falls somewhere between a manga and a western comic: more visual, moving quickly without much dialog or exposition. Kemp gives you everything you need and plenty of blood to dirty your blade.\" - Blake Morgan\nhttps://blaketmorgan.wixsite.com/blakesbuzz-1/post/war-priest\n\"The world-building was fantastic, as Kemp thought of some great ways to show some unique magics. For instance, Mathias faces off against a demon that can control the properties of the plane around him. With such a popular, time-worn genre like fantasy, new and unique magic is a must.\" - Ryan Shimek\nhttps://www.comicbookyeti.com/post/war-priest\n\"In the end, we get an epic showdown between good and evil, where both sides of the coin question the virtue of their foe\u2019s actions. Across the 9 page battle spread, we see an epic combination of fight dialogue, multi-environmental battles, and bloodshed.  There is a big cliffhanger at the end of the book that leaves me with so many questions hoping that War Priest #2 comes out quickly! What does the outcome of the battle in the 9th ward mean for Kingsland? What are other War Priests doing at this time? Are there scarier and more powerful magic users we have yet to be introduced to?

Their mother, Jasmine, was the daughter of Nazi hunters, and indoctrinated into La R\u00e9sistance after WW2. After moving to the U.S., Jasmine settled down and had three daughters, but her hard-lived past caught up with her. \nThe Deadliest Bouquet explores what happens when Rose, Poppy, and Violet have to put their resentment toward each other aside in order to find Jasmine's killer.

She resents her sisters for leaving and having lives of their own.

ABYSSAL ALBION takes place in a GREAT BRITAIN where both cosmic and folk terrors are a commonplace and chilling truth.  \nRavaged by death and madness, the series follows the continuing journey of two siblings, SISTER and BROTHER, as they try to survive a world teeming with savage cults and sanity shattering beasts.\n If you are a fan of nightmarish post-apocalypses, doom-laden horror,  and mind bending cosmic dread, this is the series for you! Where our first issue dove head-first into the nightmare filled depths of the British woodlands, the second takes us to its now less than idyllic coastlines.\nThough it\u2019s not only overly aggressive seagulls, and the unpredictable British weather our pair will have to contend with.  In their search for Sisters estranged partner the pair face the horrifying and  grotesque -  DEEP ONES.\nHalf-man, half-fish hybrid,  worshippers of the colossal ancient deity DAGON, Deep Ones now inhabit and control the worlds coastal towns and ports.\nContinuing on from our previous 28 Page issue, we shall continue to deliver a unique look at a very weird apocalypse, stunningly drawn in B&W.  \nWith your support we are set to deliver another quality issue, delving even further into the unknown world of ABYSSAL ALBION.\nWritten by cosmic horror aficionado, screenwriter, and creative producer for the DEADBOLT Films, THOMAS J CAMPBELL (BEYOND, AND NOTHING HURT) and with artwork by accomplished artist WAYNE LOWDEN (PLAINER JANE, NOCTURNE), lettering by KEN REYNOLDS (COGNITION, HERE AND THERE) and cover colours by TRILBY BLACK.\nABYSSAL ALBION is filled with exciting and spine-chilling homages to the CTHULHU MYTHOS and hopes to continue the tradition of the originators of weird fiction, H.P Lovecraft, Ambrose Bierce, Robert W. Chambers, Charlotte Gilman Perkins, Arthur Machen, amongst others.\nDrawn in striking and suitably atmospheric Black and White by WAYNE LOWDEN, with art that perfectly captures the strange and chaotic world our protagonists now find themselves in.\nThe book itself will be printed on 120gsm uncoated paper to give the pages a slightly rough, more visceral texture, and will feature a 200gsm full colour gloss laminate cover.\n\n\nBIG COMIC PAGE\n\"Imagine if you will a story that is similar to The Walking Dead, but instead of zombies shambling across the pages, you have the creeping, insidious horrors spawned by Cthulhu and the rest of his star-spawned family. Okay, I\u2019m not saying that this is another Walking Dead, but it definitely has a similar vibe, and the same potential to be an epic saga given half a chance.\"\n3 MILLION YEARS\n\"This is a real page turner, with some excellent scenes, art, lettering and storytelling. Hopefully, there is more to come from this world \u2013 those with little knowledge of the Lovecraft mythos will enjoy this as much as those who have more.\"\nCOMIC BOOK NEWS UK \n\"Wayne Lowden  really delivers something special here. It\u2019s art that oozes with unsettling qualities, encapsulating the darkness literally and metaphorically. I like it, I like it a lot. There\u2019s a tangible menace that leaked off the pages for me. Panel after panel delivers incredible detail and emotional weight. It\u2019s a heavy sketch style of monochrome brilliance, rich in shading that just sets a wonderfully dark atmosphere.\"\nTHE CONVENTION COLLECTIVE \n\"As can be expected, a story in the horror genre deserves some parental discretion. There is cursing and some violence as well as some scary imagery that skews this title towards older readers.\"\n MIDLIFEGAMERGEEK.COM \n\"The intriguing events of the issue set us up nicely to learn more about the siblings and their surroundings as we continue to follow their struggle for survival. With the first issue having come to life with the aid of a successful crowdfunding campaign, I shall be keeping a very keen eye out for the second issue\u2019s launch on Kickstarter.\"\n Of course you'll need supplies if you're to survive in the harsh world of ABYSSAL ALBION - so by backing us here is just some of what you can get!\n25mm CTHULHU Pin Badge\n25mm ABYSSAL ALBION Pin Badge\nBookmark\nFull Colour Cover Art Print\nLogo T-Shirt (Limited!)\nOriginal Art Prints\n\n As we hit our target and issue two becomes a reality, we'll be releasing a bunch of stretch goals. \nFirst of which being a unique A4 Mythos Inspired art print commissioned specially for ABYSSAL ALBION from the fantastic Davey Jebadiah Sewell - A master of occult and gothic horror imagery, a couple examples of his beautiful work can be seen below below.\nShould we go beyond even further then we have an art  variant by Canadian horror artist and illustrator Trevor Henderson.\nKnown most famously for his unsettling \u201cSIRENHEAD\u201d creature,  as well as a myriad of other terrifyingly creepy cryptids and weird imagery. As anyone who is aware of Trevor's incredible work will attest, expect something truly uncanny and horrifying.\nKeeping with the tradition of a unique campaign video that gives a glimpse into the setting wider ABYSSAL ALBION setting via short film,  SOLITUDE was shot alone during lockdown to serve as further worldbuilding into the world of ABYSSAL ALBION. \nDirected & Written by Thomas J Campbell\nScreenplay by Thomas J Campbell\nProduced & Edited by Jon Payne\nSound by Gav Chuckie Steel\nFemale Voice \u2013 Corinna Jane\nMale Voice -

Thanks for taking a look at \u201cTales of the 399.\u201d \nWe\u2019re students at Moravian College, a small liberal arts school in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. We are a class of English majors and minors, and we all have passion for writing. Some of us have made comics before, while others have not. Throughout this semester, we\u2019ve learned a lot about the creative process of comic-making in our Comics and Graphic Storytelling class, or English 399. This collection showcases our new skills.\n\u201cTales of the 399\u201d is a collection of memoirs, each written by one of us. When choosing a personal experience to illustrate, we focused on the theme of family. Some of our stories are lighthearted, while others are more serious, but each of our unique views of family bind them together.\nWe\u2019ve never attempted to publish a book on this scale before, and we\u2019re excited for others to see and read our work! We\u2019d greatly appreciate your support, as this means a lot to us as students and as authors. Our ultimate goal is to be able to print full-color copies of our collection, to distribute copies directly to you, and to gain meaningful experience in promoting and publishing our creative labors. Putting our work out into the world for the first time is scary and exciting at the same time, and we would greatly appreciate your contribution to our journey.\nPreviews\nHere's a look at some of the eight stories included in this inaugural issue:\n\"The Art Kids\" by Grace Gilbert\n\"Luke 15:20\" by Sam Riley\n\"The Half-Beating Heart\" by Evan Yandrisovitz\n\"Same Old New Year's\" by Anna Litofsky\nRewards\nOur best reward, we hope, is the book itself!

Well I spoke with F-Stop the Visionary today to come up with a fair price to create a stand alone add-on backers can add and have officially created the add-on.

In other words, it would be a whole lot like... \nWHAT IS THE SOLAVORE?\nThe Eater of Dawns\nLike a vampire needs blood, so the ancient evil known as THE SOLAVORE needs the energy of a sun. Absent for centuries from the far-off galaxy of the Morrigen people, the Solavore had disappeared into the realm of myth. But now, with one of their solar systems facing a cosmic loss, the Morrigen are learning that the Solavore is not only real... but hungry.\n\n WHO IS HUNTING IT? \nFor years, the Galactic Kingdom of the Morrigen had been protected by its latest ruler, the brave and brilliant KING THEOSIS. Committed to the freedom and safety of his people, King Theosis has lead the Morrigen through decades of darkness, striving toward a future of progress and peace. But after so many battles, Theosis's beard has gone white; the grip on his sword has grown weaker.  And after a devastating personal loss, Theosis must summon a strength he's never known to defeat the worst threat the Morrigen have ever seen.\nFortunately for Theosis, his husband ABBINOIR will be there to help. Wise and compassionate as any ruler his people have served, Abbinoir is Theosis's personal strength. While the king is looking out for the kingdom, Abbinoir looks out for its king. And though he's been doing it for all of Theosis's reign, every new threat weighs more on his mind, none more so than the Solavore. After all, how can you protect a man who must protect a kingdom?\nNot that he won't have help. In facing this unheard-of crisis, Theosis will have at his command some of the best warriors in the entire galaxy: his own royal guard and the elite female warriors known as the VALKINAE. Together, they make up the best defense the Morrigen have.\nBut will they be enough?\n\nSNEAK PREVIEW\nCheck out some of the (not finalized) pages of HUNT FOR THE SOLAVORE.\n(Pages not final)\n(Pages not final)\n(Pages not final)\n WHO IS CREATING HUNT FOR THE SOLAVORE? \nLANE LLOYD - Creator of the weird and zany, Lane is an up and coming artist with an energetic, off the wall style. After being featured on Comic Book Yeti, Outright Geekery, and The Driving Creators Network, Lane's comic GOD-PUNCHER smashed its way onto Kickstarter, receiving more than double the projected amount of funding.  With HUNT FOR THE SOLAVORE, Lane uses their skill of designing strange, larger-than-life characters to tell a story that's both firmly planted in the horror genre and stretched to the outer limits of science fiction.\nGRANT DeARMITT - Grant's tales of the sinister and strange have been published at Haw Creek Horror, Crystal Lake Publishing, and Black Hole Entertainment.  A lifelong fan of weird fiction and fantasy epics, Grant hopes HUNT FOR THE SOLAVORE will present the human side of cosmic terror; an otherworldly story that hits home.\n\nWHY ARE THEY CREATING IT?\nKing Theosis's ship. For interplanetary travel... and beyond.\nLane and Grant have spent two years developing the shocking showdown of Theosis and the Solavore. They made this Kickstarter to bring that story to life in the form it deserves: the comic book format.  But there is another reason. \nHUNT FOR THE SOLAVORE is just one story of thousands set in this all-new universe that Lane and Grant have cooked up. Getting it created, printed, and into the hands of readers like yourself is the first step in telling those tales. We believe that comic fans are hungry for new worlds and new terrors, and we believe we have some great ones to offer.\nSo by backing this project, you're not just helping us make a comic. You're opening a door to another galaxy, and all the heroes and horrors that live there.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIt takes time and a whole lot of effort to put together a story as ambitious as HUNT FOR THE SOLAVORE, which is why we're making sure our creative team gets funding to do so! $4200 will go to Lane for his brilliant work drawing, inking, coloring, AND lettering each gorgeous and terrifying page of HFTS, while $2100 will go to Grant for his plotting, several edits, and writing of the script.

So, once we hit the goal, the book can hit the presses, and be in your hands post-haste.\n\n\nWHAT FOLKS ARE SAYING ABOUT THOUGHTSCAPE...\n\"ThoughtScape Comics is the quintessential, beautifully packaged and expertly made serialized sci-fi anthology that comics needs right now.\" -Liana Kangas: Trve Kvlt, She Said Destroy, Black AF: Devil's Dye\n\"Fantastic, artistically diverse and engaging stories of a cool far future world, all tied together with prodigious panache by writer Matt Mair Lowery.

She uses her magic to be a hero, to fight the good fight, and to defend humanity from the world\u2019s greatest evils\u2026 or does she?\nThe story begins as a mysterious figure collapses at her door in fear. The figure begs Occulus for her help, claiming that he is being chased by a terrifying hound larger than any dog he has ever seen, with eyes that burn like fire.\nWill our hero be able to protect the weary traveler from the nightmarish hellhound that pursues him? Or will the monster prove too formidable of a foe? Will Occulus live up to her moniker as London\u2019s greatest magician, or will her arcane power reveal that there is far more to this tale than even she may have expected?\nOcculus #1 follows our protagonist, Esme Eldritch. The self-proclaimed master of mystery and sovereign of sorcery known as Occulus, who has been fighting monsters and evil forces for millennia. The first issue of the series focuses on how she became such an iconic name in the world of magic, and what sorts of threats hide in the darkness waiting to be unleashed.\n The action pact first issue deals with the character's origins, how she obtained her powers and how she uses them for good. But as time goes on, it becomes apparent that the stranger is not the man he says he is, but rather, a powerful warlock. But why the disguise? Why the decoy? Why Occulus? All these questions and more will be answered in the pages of Occulus #1.\nOcculus is A 28-page comic book featuring a modern twist on one of storytelling\u2019s most ancient genres, Magic. Our new Sci-Fi / Fantasy / Superhero comic series is set in the bustling heart of London. The Big Smoke has seen its fair share of heroes and villains, but on one fateful night, a storm tears its way through the city, unleashing a monster straight from the depths of hell.\nWe're thrilled to be offering art prints by three different artists for this campaign! So if you select our Art Print pledge level then you will be receiving all three of these amazing designs, or on our standard physical pledge level, you will get one of your choosing! \nPrint A - Guillermo Villarreal\nPrint B - Domenico Pagano\nPrint C - Kevin Bouchard\nOcculus is the second series in Broadcast Comic's 'Superhuman Universe', following on from Diamond #1 that launched on Kickstarter in 2020. \n\nWhile both series are set within the same universe, their stories run parallel, meaning that if you haven't had the chance to check out Diamond #1, you can still start right here with Occulus.\n\nHowever - If we have piqued your interest, both Physical and Digital copies of Diamond #1 are available as pledge rewards, meaning you can get caught up in all of the superhuman madness that is rocking our fictional London. \n Matthew Hardy makes his writing debut for Broadcast Comics with Occulus #1, but those familiar with the UK Indie Comics scene are sure to recognize him from his amazing work over at Mad Robot Comics.\nKieren Stevens returns to Broadcast Comics as the co-writer of Occulus #1, after a successful Kickstarter campaign for Diamond #1 in late 2020. \nAnother new face to the Broadcast Comics team is Guillermo Villareal. This hugely talented artist has done an incredible job of bringing the world of Occulus to life, and we can't wait for you to see everything that he has been working on.  \nRob Jones also makes his return to Broadcast Comics reprising his role as Letterer Supreme. Those familiar with Rob's work will know how much impact his work adds to a story, and if you haven't seen him in action, then this book will blow your socks off!

The doctor readily accepts the position, but goes about the work with much trial and error. \n\nDoctor Caim encounters patients from all walks of life, experimenting with treatments while monitoring his own health and watching the stars for omens...\n\nInterior Pages\nResearch is the integral foundation of both the script and design of The Plague and Doctor Caim. Each medical treatment Doctor Caim tries and every situation Doctor Caim finds himself in is based on historical facts. \n\nWith the aesthetic of a medieval illuminated manuscript, this graphic novel finds macabre comedy within the history of the bubonic plague.\nThe plague doctor has fascinated all sorts of people with his instantly recognisable costume and beak mask, but many are unfamiliar with the history behind them. The plague doctor appears in many supernatural-themed comics, is a favorite among numerous cosplayers, and can be found adorning many bodies as tattoos\u2026 but none of these glimpses of the sinister silhouette delves into the reality of the plague doctor\u2019s life, as The Plague and Doctor Caim does.\nThe Plague and Doctor Caim Hardback Book\nG.

Since I began working on my graphic novel trilogy The Poet and the Flea, about the poet-painter William Blake (1757 \u2013 1827), I have often thought of Blake\u2019s illuminated manuscripts (his illustrated poems) as a precursor to today\u2019s comics in their uniquely Blakean combination of word and image.\nWhile working on The Plague and Doctor Caim, which takes place 100 years or so before Blake\u2019s time, I hit upon a connection between Doctor Caim and the illuminated manuscripts that must have inspired Blake. Illuminated manuscripts date as far back as the year 400 up through the 1600s (and perhaps beyond, if we include Blake and other artists). The quintessential illuminated manuscript is a book from Europe during the Middle Ages handwritten in blackletter and painted with vibrant pigments by monks. These books were mostly Christian texts such as the bible or a book of hours."}, {"status": [{"Project funds successfully": "263 backers pledged \u00a36,594"}]}], "comments": []}}, {"backer": "Oliver Mertz", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Down below the abandoned skyscrapers and crumbling colonial architecture, beneath the buzzing lights and ragged billboards, is a fading, floundering city propped up by vice, extortion, and fear.

There\u2019s magic, mystery, personal drama, and an accidentally carnivorous plant.\nWitches have been a part of the political fabric of Washington D.C. since it was founded. It\u2019s only since the 1960s that witches stood together and fought to take back the word \u201cHexed\u201d. A movement was ignited when witches came out of the shadows and proudly showed off their broomsticks.\nThe witch-hunt for Charlie, Jaya and Florence continues as they find themselves on the run from malevolent forces both inside and outside the government. The three witches must harness their powers to defend themselves, while unraveling a mystery that could save the entire witching community.\n\nKirsten Thompson is a comic writer and editor based in the Pacific Northwest.

That being said, some of the things that rely on external production (The manufacture of rewards, logistics of packing & shipping individual rewards) may cause some delays. \n\nDepending on the print quantity, we may choose to print our books in Canada or overseas. If so, there could be problems such as our books being held in customs, and longer shipping times. \n\nI have spent the past eight months planning and refining this project. I have accounted for these potential problems and worked them into our schedule. \n\nEveryone will be updated every step of the way, throughout the entire production process.

Jaded after millenia of destruction and death, Xolotl hid away and watched his family sacrifice themselves in the name of hope for life beyond themselves.\nXolotl, alone and ashamed, became racked with guilt, causing him to weep so intensely that his eyes fell from his head and descended to the center of the newly forged universe: the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan.\nSeeing an opportunity to redeem himself, to honor the sacrifice of his family, Xolotl guided the Aztecs to forge two macahuitl, imbued with a piece of his own godhood. The Left and Right Eye of Xolotl, entrusted to twin siblings to wield together in defense of the Fifth Sun, became known as...The Twin Blades.\nArt by Julio Suarez and Rocco Langg, logo by Andrea Rosales\nNow in the year 2108, the blades are entrusted to twins Xiomara and Basilio Gutierrez who inherited them as children. Xiomara is strong willed, determined, and believes in herself. She's committed to her role as wielder and her sworn purpose of defending the Fifth Sun...but Basilio? Well, there isn't exactly a bunch of threats to the Sun running around and he's ready to move on with his life. Leaving his role as Wielder behind to pursue his goal of becoming a teacher, Basilio strains his relationship with his sister. \n\nUnfortunately, things are rarely so simple. The Lord of the North himself TEZCATLIPOCA sees a distracted pantheon and a set of divided Wielders as an opportunity to mobilize his pawn YAOTL: a resurrected traitorous Jaguar Warrior now obsessed with never returning to Mictl\u0101n, the land of the dead. Yaotl is bestowed with a blade forged from the primordial Black itself and sets out to destroy the Fifth Sun and create a new universe for Lord Tezcatlipoca.\n\nCan Xiomara and Basilio stop arguing long enough to stop Tezcatlipoca's champion? Even if they can...will it be enough?\n\nTHE TEAM\nThe Twin Blades is a latine story and is proudly produced by an entirely latine team of creators:\nWritten by Jarred Luj\u00e1n: Jarred is a Mexican-American comic writer from the promised land of Texas. A 2019 Mad Cave Studios winner, he broke onto the comics scene with the four-issue mini-series Dry Foot. He likes the Wu-Tang Clan and existentialism. \n\nArt by Julio Suarez: Julio Suarez is a Mexican illustrator, having worked his whole life towards becoming a comic book artist, his passion for drawing has allowed him to work for companies such as Upperdeck Ent. and Cryptozoic Ent. as a sketch card artist, working with licenses such as Marvel and DC Comics, as well as freelance illustration work the last couple of years, now making his debut in the comic industry with \u201cThe Twin Blades\u201d as an artist, he is ready to show the world what he can do!\n\nColors by Rocco Langg: Based in Mexico City, she has worked on several comics ranging from commercial work for Mexican companies to her interactive IG comic Goodbye and Fuck You! She has a passion for sci fi and vibrant colors.\n\nLetters by Gabriela Downie: From California, Gabriela has been in the comic industry for 7 years. She's done a little bit of everything including production art, cover art, and lettering. Her work includes Harleen, Beast Boy Loves Raven, Punchline, and Batman '89.\n\nTHE SWORDS\nThe LEFT EYE of XOLOTL, wielded by main character XIOMARA\nThe RIGHT EYE of XOLOTL - Wielded by main character Basilio\nThe blades of THE TWIN BLADES\nTHE PREVIEW PAGES \nTHE PRONUNCIATIONS\nWhile you wait for THE TWIN BLADES to hit your eyeballs, learn to pronounce some of the more intimidating words for English speakers:\nXolotl\nTezcatlipoca\nMacuahuitl\nXiomara", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks are minimal.

Dance is something that is seen as beautiful, but many don\u2019t think about the pain that is done to one\u2019s body to truly be a dancer. Martial arts are thought of as violent because it\u2019s a form of \u201cfighting\u201d, but there\u2019s also a dance like quality to this work of art.\nBut once you dig deeper, the reader will quickly realize that The Dancer is actually a story about mental health. Mia is forced to face her own childhood trauma of witnessing her parents\u2019 murder when she becomes the enemy that she once dedicated her life to fight against. The Dancer is a morally gray story that shows that good and evil aren\u2019t so black and white.\nWith They Call Her...The Dancer #1, you get...\nA 22-page, stapled, standard sized comic book printed by Comic Impressions,\nincluding a Black & White edition\nand FOR THE FIRST TIME also in COLOR! \n 5 Covers to choose from, including a limited Kickstarter Exclusive FOIL cover!\n Here's what comic book critics and pros are saying about THE DANCER:\nKat at comic conventions way back when those were a thing...\nThey Call Her...The Dancer #1 COVER A\nCover B - Perfect Blue Homage - Saw Nai Mon\nWhen brainstorming variants for The Dancer, I knew I wanted something to showcase the shattering of 2 identities.

The anime film Perfect Blue goes through similar themes of identity, and its movie poster was a perfect homage for our premiere issue.\nSaw Nai Mon is an Animator/Illustrator and has graduated from LASALLE College of the Arts (Singapore) with a Diploma in Animation.

Unfortunately, he's been reincarnated as this guy...\nVictor's an unemployed millennial slacker who can't even get his life together much less slay a dragon.\nCan Mooney and Hazel prepare Victor for the battle of a lifetime?\nBeowulf is an epic tale that spans centuries, with heroes and villains fighting across time itself. Characters who are heroes in one lifetime may end up villains over the centuries. Lovers in one lifetime may become sworn enemies in the next.\nIf this all sounds overwhelming. Don\u2019t worry \u2014 there\u2019s also a lot of humor.\nSample pages below.

In a world where most animals have been hunted to extinction, technology now allows people to create whatever monster they want for their bloody entertainment. Hunters from all over the world rise to the challenge to earn a spot in the world finals of The Preserve! For the former champion, Winston Abara, and his artist, Rachel Lin, their journey to victory will for more than glory and riches, but the chance to save their home. Yet the primal allure of the game is powerful, and despite going against Winston's belief in the natural order of life, will he succumb to the evil influence of...The Preserve.\"\nCharacter Designs by Taylor Keith\nThe Preserve is a 5 Issue mini-series, starting with this first one being 28 pages. Set in the not so distant future, where the largest sporting event in the world has become The Preserve, a live game where hunters enter a prepared terrain to hunt a creature designed by the \u201cArtist\u201d of the other team, which then gets brought to life and released into the stadium. The game is controlled by the biggest corporation on the planet, Packard Industries, whose CEO runs the game. Our heroes (Winston and Rachel) enter the game to win the world finals and save their home from becoming the next Preserve! \nThe story explores the gentrification of these major sporting events, as well as the sanctity of life while criticizing hunting as a sport and the disrespect society has for animals. Tone-wise, this is like Running Man meets the Hunger Games in a sports movie with the feel of Jurassic Park. Those who love those movies, as well as science-fiction, action, and deep characters fighting for what's right will enjoy this comic!\nPage 1 (Art & Lettering by Taylor Keith, Coloring by Crystal Pandita)\nPage 2 (Art & Lettering by Taylor Keith, Coloring by Crystal Pandita)\nPage 3 (Art & Lettering by Taylor Keith, Coloring by Crystal Pandita)\nPage 4 (Art & Lettering by Taylor Keith, Coloring by Crystal Pandita)\nPage 5 (Art & Lettering by Taylor Keith, Coloring by Crystal Pandita)\nPage 6 (Art & Lettering by Taylor Keith, Coloring by Crystal Pandita)\nL.A. Chavez is the writer of The Preserve! His first project was Frontier-0, a self-funded space opera comic with an animated pilot! Then recently, he funded the first issue of his fantasy comic, Santa Fae, right here on Kickstarter! Now he's looking to expand into new territory with a more grounded sci-fi story, which became this comic.  When not writing, he enjoys reading, cooking, and talking with his friends online. Check out his work at:  www.wickedsuitproductions.com\nTaylor Keith is the amazing artist bringing this comic to life! Based in North Carolina, US, she is an illustrator and comic artist with a passion for sci-fi, fantasy, and all things horror. \nCrystal Pandita is the colorist and cover artist for The Preserve! Hailing from Jakarta, she began her artistic career 2 years ago, honing her craft and working on comics like String, which you can find on Tapas. She loves horror and has a fondness for sci-fi technology.\nLettersquids is a letterer and graphic designer who has worked on several amazing indie comics, including projects with Scout, Action Lab, Advent Comics, Insight Comics, and many others. His comic Antares Finest (with art by ErrorBound) won the titles of \"Best Comic\" and \"Best Lettering\" on r/comicbookcollabs' 2019 Untold Worlds Anthology. He's jumping in as the official letter for The Preserve and doing the entire comic with his unique skills!\nSwamp Monster Design\nThis whole endeavor is so that we can fund the rest of the comic, we keep none for ourselves.  All our costs go into the project, to the artist, colorist, and letterer, as well the printer and the shipping costs, so we need your help to help us finish it and see it become a reality! ^^\nBy just pledging $6, you can get the digital PDF of the entire first issue of The Preserve! And for $12, you can hold the physical copy in your hands! However you choose to read this story, we know you'll enjoy it! It's 28 pages of top-quality work by the amazing team of artists we've assembled to tell this tale, rooted in our main characters coming together. I really like to think of it as a slice-of-life sports movie that meets a John Wick-style horror story about monsters! ^^ \nAlternate Version of Cover\nAnd for $20, on top of those, you'll also get the 36-page digital PDF of the first issue of my previous comic, SANTA FAE (complete with bonus short)! A fantasy crime drama about two elves knights looking to solve the murder that could shake the entire city of Santa Fae to its core! I like to describe it as Batman meets Lord Of The Rings, and if you're a fan of either (or both), you will LOVE this comic! ^^\nSanta Fae # 1 Cover by Kal Huset\nAnd for those of you who like to collect really cool art pieces, we offer one of the two awesome exclusive posters for The Preserve for those who pick the $30 tier! Each done by a different and talented artist, showcasing our two protagonists in their element. Winston Abara (The Hunter) by Ahmed Raafat and Rachel Lin (The Artist) by Lindsy Silva.\nWinston (The Hunter) Exclusive Print by Ahmed Raafat\nRachel (Artist) Exclusive Print by Lindsy Silva\nAnd finally, for those who are generous enough to donate $50 or more, we will give you a special producer credit and put your name at the end of the comic for your contribution. And for those who pledge $100, our amazing artist will draw you a special monster commission of your choosing designed to your specifications like the official ones you see below, which you can name! We'll make a special offer to the first 5 who pledge, to include their monster somewhere in the comic itself if they want!\nNOTE: All our shipping rewards are limited to the U.S., Canada, and the U.K, but if you are from somewhere else in the world and are interested, message us directly and we could work around it.\nMonster Designs by Taylor Keith\nMonster Design by Taylor Keith\nAs much as we'd be happy with simply reaching our goal, if you guys want to see more content from us, then if we can cross the goal by an extra 600$ over the amount we set, we'll make a short bonus comic expanding on the world of The Preserve and my favorite supporting character, Contessa Francesca \"La Benelli\" Urbina! A badass hunter from Italian nobility looking to prove herself on the world stage of The Preserve!  It will be drawn by the amazing artist Jenny Odio, and I'd love to be able to include this short at the end of Issue 1!

Badass, am I right?! ^^"}, {"status": [{"Project funds successfully": "313 backers pledged $5,449"}, {"Project launches": "MARCH 10, 2021"}]}], "comments": []}}, {"backer": "Oliver Mertz", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Follow the continuing exploits of the Next Generation of Great Detectives. See the new stretch goals in the Rewards section below!\nLondon, 1914 - Major Sheffield Holmes, nephew to the great detective, and his mysterious American partner Capt. Imogen Watson have uncovered a secret society known as \"The Moriarty,\" a dark cabal that has vowed revenge on the Holmes family. Joined by the gruff Det. Inspector Agamemmnon J. Brick of Scotland Yard and the resourceful mechanic Juliette McKinnon, the new Holmes and Watson must defeat the zealot known only as \"The Scholar\" and prevent Europe from descending into war!\nMAJOR HOLMES & CAPTAIN WATSON #3-4 picks up right where we left off and completes the first arc of the series, known as \"The Adventure of the Vengeful Scholar.\" Having discovered the existence of the villainous cabal known as \"The Moriarty,\" fanatical followers of the long-dead Napolean of Crime, the new Holmes and Watson must rely on their friends and their skills to uncover their nefarious plan and rescue someone very important to Sheffield Holmes.  But will the dark secrets in each of their pasts unravel the nascent 6th Special Intelligence Service? Issue 3 is a 24-page thriller that continues the tale, and the jam-packed 36 page Issue #4 brings the shocking conclusion to life. That's 60 pages of comics, what a deal!\n\nMajor Holmes & Captain Watson is a true labor of love for me, as a writer. I've wanted to tell this story since I was 9 years old when my Grandmother gave me a copy of The Complete Sherlock Holmes. I fell in love with the Great Detective then, and have reread his adventures over and over.  When (most of) the Holmes canon became public domain, I decided I wanted to put a new twist on the old tales, to create a new Holmes and Watson that shook up old ideas. Sheffield Holmes and Imogen Watson are equals, more than anything else, real partners and friends who rely on each other. They are both great detectives and skilled spies as well, and England will soon need them. They also each old dark secrets about themselves...\nCheck out a preview of Issue #3 below. \n\u201cI could tell from the first page of the preview art that I'd be into this\u2026 take(s) well-worn characters and remix(es) them in surprising ways\u201d - SYFY Wire.\n\n\"Stepping out from the shadow of giants is hard, but Jeff and Ismael have done a tremendous job in doing just that. A story that feels Sherlockian, but steps onto its own path with its own characters in its own story\" - Jarred Luj\u00e1n, writer - DRY FOOT (Mad Cave Comics)\n\n\u201cMajor Sheffield Holmes is not the Holmes you\u2019re expecting\u2026 Like his famous uncle he\u2019s intelligent, inquisitive, and quick-witted. Also like his Uncle his secrets run deep\u2026 Ismael Canales makes excellent choices regarding character expressions and level of detail.\u201d - WhatchaReading.com \nissue #3 cover by Ismael Caneles and Roger Sorruca\nIssue #4 cover, by Ismael Canales and Roger Sorruca\nSTRETCH GOALS ADDED!\nWe breezed past the goal so quickly we barely got time to tease these, but they have been added now! \nTHIRD STICKER DESIGN / PHONE CALENDAR WALLPAPERS ADDED!\n We'll be adding the third sticker to every tier that gets the pack. Every physical tier that doesn't include the whole pack will get at least one random sticker! And the digital tiers will be getting very cool digital phone wallpapers as well.\nThe NEW Major Holmes Sticker pack. Check out that Brick sticker!\n\nTHIRD NEW INTELLIGENCE PRINT ADDED, ALL PRINTS INCREASED TO FULL 8\"X10\"\nIn addition to intel on the villain known as \"The Scholar\" and Holmes & Watson's famous motorcycles, we'll add the detailed file on the Armaments of the 6th S.I.S. to the Special Dossier.  We're also increasing the size of these prints to full 8x10!\nWe're adding two VERY LIMITED EDITION Artists COMMISSION TIERS to the campaign. \nSeries artist Ismael Canales will provide FOUR one-of-a-kind 8x10 Commissions for lucky collectors! Each will feature one character of the backers choosing, be it a favorite from Major Holmes & Captain Watson, or any other character you're a fan of. Each Commission will feature ONLY a single character and, to quote Ismael \"I always add something in the background, to add context; I don\u00b4t like the character to be \"floating\" in the blank of the paper.\" Check out the image below to see something similar Ismael did for me personally!\nClick the image to see a higher-resolution version. It's really quite something.\nThese tiers have a slightly higher shipping cost, as all the commissions have to be shipped from Spain to Florida to be added to packages and then shipped on to backers. They will also deliver a little more slowly, as Ismael will wait to ship them to me until they are all complete. We'll keep backers updated on shipping dates, we think we've overestimated so as not to disappoint.\nAt this level, we're upgrading all the physical books to an upgraded 80# Premium Covers Stock. This will give every issue a premium look and feel beyond a typical floppy comic and make these Kickstarter Editions true collector's items. This is the same grade cover stock we upgraded to for #1-2, but we MAY go with a less glossy page and more of a matte to make them easier to sign! THESE BOOKS WILL ONLY BE AVAILABLE in this format from us!\n This is really something special. At this level, we're unlocking PHYSICAL printing of the 2nd Major Holmes & Captain Watson prose short story available in our top TWO tier sets. This will come in a collectible 5.25\" x 8\" booklet with a 10pt gloss cover with special cover! But we're not just giving cool things to the top-tier folks. The DIGITAL PDF of the short story, written by series writer Jeff Rider, will now also be available in EVERY DIGITAL REWARDS PACKAGE. That's right, every single backer will get some version of this story now! In addition, every package that includes all 4 issues will get the digital version of the FIRST Sheffield Holmes prose short \"The Adventure of the Errant Slipper\" by Jeff Rider. \nCheck out our latest update for all the details on Add-Ons, now available directly on the Kickstarter platform!\nNew Swag!\nWe've got some really great stuff planned, both for folks who've already read our first two issues and newcomers who want to get hold of the entire first arc.  There are also early bird tiers and some special add-ons and new stretch goals coming.  Here's a quick peek at the prototype 6th S.I.S. pocket notebooks! \nThe 6th S.I.S. Officers Field Notebook, lined on the inside (pen for scale only, final product may vary)\n The \"Brick Series\" alt-covers return!\nWe're excited to have two new alt-covers featuring fan-favorite character Agamemnon J. Brick, Scotland Yards biggest, baddest Detective Inspector! With art once again by Michael Dorman, these rare editions will feature colors by Anthony Lee. They'll be previewed here and added as stretch goals and add-ons once the campaign is live. Here's a  preview of the Alt Cover for #3, it's a work in progress, and we'll update this as it develops, but this is pretty close to the final version!\nBrick got SHOT, and he is NOT happy about it!\n Check out the Special Dossier packaging and print sets, with new prints for this campaign.\nPLAY\n\n Here's the full list of Rewards! Plus we'll open the Add-On store with more awesome stuff like the Alt-covers once the campaign has funded!\nJeff Rider - is a writer living in Orlando who publishes his comics in print and digitally at CloudwranglerComics.com and on ComiXology. Jeff has been telling stories since he could talk and loves collaborative art in all its forms. In addition to Major Holmes & Captain Watson he\u2019s the writer of the urban fantasy series The Arcane Cocktail Enthusiast with artist Davide Puppo (successfully funded via Kickstarter), the sci-fi adventure Gravity Matters with Sean Dillon (also a successful Kickstarter), and many more comics to be collected in an anthology of shorts coming this year.\nIsmael Canales - Ismael has worked with independent publishers both from the USA and Spain (ECV Press, Diabolo Ediciones, NowEvolution, Marauder Film), mainly in comic book anthologies with short stories. He started collaborating with Butxido Agency, and since then he has worked in the comics Athena Voltaire (ActionLab) and The Catch (Kickstarter) and is also currently working on a graphic novel for Dolmen Editorial (Spain). He lives in his hometown with his lovely girlfriend and their little (and evil) bunny, Guantes.\nRoger Sorruca - Roger Sorruca is an Illustrator, digital artist, and comics colorist living and working in Barcelona, Spain. In addition to Major Holmes & Captain Watson, he is the colorist for Athena Voltaire (Action Lab.)\nJustin Birch - Justin Birch is a  2018 Ringo Award-nominated letterer born and raised in the hills of West Virginia. Lettering comics since 2015, he is a member of the lettering studio AndWorld Design and has worked with DC, IDW, Dynamite, Lion Forge Comics, Mad Cave Studios, Action Lab Comics, DMC Comics, Source Point Press, Z2 Comics, and numerous indy publishers. Justin still lives in West Virginia, only now it\u2019s with his loving wife, daughter, and their dog, Kirby.\nEveryone knows that comics don't get made cheaply. When I created these books, I wanted to make sure that the artists got paid for their work upfront, and at a fair market rate. The majority of the money raised during this campaign goes to cover those artistic costs, cash that goes straight to Ismael, Roger, and Justin plus all the talented artists making art for Alt-Covers and stretch goals. They're the folks who made this story so awesome to read and look at. The rest are costs associated with the physical production of the books and other rewards like packaging, prints, etc. As the creator of Major Holmes & Captain Watson,  I don't take a page rate for myself on these books. Rather, as with every other campaign, any money raised beyond our goal goes to fund future issues of Major Holmes & Captain Watson! Rest assured, while these books are the end of this story arc, this is only the beginning of their adventures. \n (This is subject to change, and we'll update this section as the campaign progresses.)\nFeb 16\n\u2022 The campaign launches, with issue #3 already complete. \n\u2022 Issue #4 writing and line art also already complete.\nGoal reached\n\u2022 Orders for swag and other non-book rewards go out to suppliers as SOON as we hit our funding goal! These are sometimes slower than printing, so we don't want to wait.\nBeginning of March\n\u2022 Coloring work on issue #4 begins.\nBeginning of April\n\u2022 Issue #4 lettering begins.\nMid-April\n\u2022 Issue #3 and #4 go to the printers.\nEarly-Mid May\n\u2022 Rewards begin shipping!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSo far the risk and challenges to Major Holmes & Captain Watson #'s 3-4 are very few. As you can see from the timeline above, the books are already very nearly complete. Coloring and lettering of issue #4, back matter creation, and layout are the only things left to complete before the books go to the printer. Some additional digital and comics perks like prints, custom packaging, and stretch goal rewards will be the only items to be created after the project ends, due to needing to know the total number of backers and so forth.\n\nThese orders will come while we're still in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic, but we're working with a printer we trust, and they assure us delays are unlikely. This is our second time with this particular printer and they were great back in Nov 2020, so we expect more of the same.\n\nThis is also my fifth Kickstarter and the second for the Major Holmes series and is similar in scope to our previous projects. Those projects funded quickly, and all digital and physical rewards were shipped within the promised deadlines, less than three months after the end of the campaign. I've learned the value of making sure that the comic is almost entirely complete before launching a campaign means a really quick turnaround time and rapid rewards delivery. The few hiccups from our earlier endeavors became teachable moments for this one, so I expect even more smooth sailing. As always, should the unexpected happen, we'll keep everyone updated.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 8 or more", "title": "See, and Observe", "descp": "Get a DRM free PDF of Major Holmes & Captain Watson #3 and #4.

I have a largely volunteer team of incredible creators working with me to record all aspects of Daniels\u2019 life, and we\u2019ve received permission to capture some of the most amazing things you\u2019ll ever see on film. We're talking everything from SWAT courses to one-on-one armored combat trials in a literal ring of fire.\nI've also gathered - and am working with a team to professionally scan - thousands of pictures, along with archiving countless hours of old footage of Daniel's life and travels. \nDaniel's favorite photograph.\nThis is a story that deserves to be told. \nI've spent almost half a year building the team, outlining the 2021 schedule and shooting tests for SOLDIER... and we are ready to launch! Our budget includes everything to make the film I want to make: multiple field and interview days, storage drives for an extraordinary amount of 4K footage, archival still and video clean-up, editing, audio mixing, an original score, color correction sessions... and even an initial round of film festival submissions. It ALSO includes the 10% that goes to Kickstarter and charge fees, as well as taxes. Come join us on this adventure. We can't do it without you.\nPrototype t-shirts tested for maximum softness by my kitty, Miyazaki.\nSpeaking of you...\nI've prepared a number of reward tiers that reflect my commitment to local businesses. From hand-illustrated silkscreen t-shirts (with Endgame Clothing) to Portland printed DVD covers, post cards and poetry sheets (with StevensIS), you'll not only be backing an important film, you'll be backing family owned shops and receiving exclusive items. And as far as the t-shirts go, you'll get multiple design options. (Kitty not included.)\nThe team.  \nJustin, Jordan and Scott.

Each issue features complete, stand-alone stories that are always exciting, sometimes humorous, and occasionally downright scary.\n(Okay,  it's not that scary. There are no nightmares here. But we've learned that young readers love the idea of reading comics their parents think are too scary for them.) \nWe're using this Kickstarter campaign to raise funds to print the 33-page issue, House of Fear: Rubber & Glue, and hopefully, we'll hit a couple of Stretch Goals along the way for some additional items. \nWhat's it About?\nOur first story, \"Rubber & Glue,\" introduces us to a couple of students from Savini Middle School.\nCaden and Isaac aren't exactly friends. \nAnd everything is most certainly not okay here. \nCaden thinks he has the upper hand, as always. But this time, he's in for a shock. Isaac isn't just repeating a childish retort...\n...but instead is casting a curse. One that will force Caden to live a day in the life of the bullied. \nThis story isn't the Monster-of-the-Month fare you've come to expect from House of Fear, but instead, examines the roles we play in middle school, and shines light on just how easy a harmless prank becomes something worse. It's as if Stephen King wrote an after-school special. \nThis issue also features a backup story, \"The Trees Have Eyes.\" This one starts peacefully enough, with Tosh and his dad out for a pleasant hike in the woods. \nWell, maybe not so peaceful or pleasant for Dad. And when they venture off the trail...\n...and into a copse of aspen trees, things take a turn for the worse.\nTrust me, you'll never look at Aspen trees the same again. \nWhat to Expect\nHere's what you can expect when you back our latest campaign:\nOne issue featuring two complete, stand-alone stories.\n33 pages of full-color thrills.\nFun, exciting comics suitable for (almost) all ages.\nBagged/boarded comics shipped in sturdy packaging.\nWe print House of Fear domestically, which means a faster turn around time (within 2 months of the campaign end).  \nWe're now printing on a heavy 70 lb paper stock with a 100 lb cover stock.  A heavier stock means the comics stand up to multiple reads and make the book more suitable for sharing. \nStretch and Milestone Goals\nWe recently had our 175th backer, which means every backer gets a set of print-at-home activity pages. This set includes prompts for kids to draw their own monsters and comics, and of course, also includes coloring pages. \nIf we reach 200 backers, all backers will receive a PDF of the B&W version of The Trees Have Eyes. See Jethro's line work in all its glory in this special version of the story. \nIf we reach 225 backers, I'll upgrade the Digital Deluxe PDF to a full, behind-the-scenes, making of book. I received lots of feedback after our last campaign for this style of book, and I'm excited for the opportunity to do it again for Rubber & Glue.\nOur First Kickstarter Exclusive Variant\nWe're big fans of the old EC comics, so for this campaign, we created our first variant cover as an homage to those horror comics from the 50s. Those are James Hislope's lines, and Josh Jensen's colors, with Matt Krotzer on letters and design. They absolutely nailed it, didn't they?\nAs a way to reward backers with a piece of House of Fear history, the variant is an exclusive to Kickstarter. We'll print to order (with an overage of 10% to cover possible damage during transit), so don't expect too many of these to make it to my online shop or to convention tables. \nThe Rare, Serialized Variant\nWe've also got a rare variant for this campaign. This one features art by Jethro Morales and colors by Josh Jensen. There will be no House of Fear trade dress on the cover. Just the frightful artwork. \nEach copy will be individually serialized to only 31 copies. \nBoyle Minifig\nWe've partnered with Justin at Saber-Scorpion to produce a limited-edition Boyle minifig. The look and accessories are specific to this issue and will only be made available during this campaign. \nThe image below is a prototype of what you can expect.\nExclusive, Crossover Print\nOur first House of Fear crossover is here! Anyone who backs a physical reward for this campaign and the one for Phil Falco's Haunting 1-3 will receive this exclusive print, signed by the writers on both books. (Digital backers who back both will receive a digital version of the art.)\nStunning art by Jethro Morales and Josh Jensen\nHaunting is a solid, supernatural horror comic for teens and adults. So if you have older kids in your house or if you like to sample new horror for yourself, now's the time to try something new!  \n The Rewards \nAdd Ons\nIf you've backed a print tier, you can add additional print copies of House of Fear: Rubber & Glue. You can also catch up on all of the House of Fear comics with the Digital Catch Up add on. We have stickers, too!\nAfter you select a tier to back, Kickstarter will take you to the Add-On page. If you see another issue you'd like to have, simple select it from the Add-On page. \nOther print issues of House of Fear will be available as add-on options after the campaign has ended.\nPreview Pages\nBelow are pages from House of Fear: Rubber & Glue.\nShipping and Delivery\nOur young readers aren't overly concerned with mint comics. All they care about is reading the story....and rereading it as many times as possible. \nBut there are a lot of collectors reading House of Fear, too. We know true horror is getting a Kickstarter package in the mail and finding a crumpled comic inside.\nWith that in mind, we pack our books with the same care we used in making the book and the love that we have for our backers.\nAll comics come bagged and boarded. \nAny order that consists of 1 or 2 comics will be shipped in a sturdy, oversize envelope (stay flat mailers from Pratt Plus). \nAll orders of 3 or more comics will be shipped in a Gemini Mailer for added protection. \nAll packages will be sent via USPS Media Mail, First Class, or Priority Mail, depending on weight.\nTimeline and Budget\nThe comic is 100% complete, so all we need to do is send the issue and sticker sheet to the printers. After 2-3 weeks, I'll start shipping everything to backers. \nBut where do the funds go?\nAbout half of the funds we earn through Kickstarter will be used to print the comic and other rewards. Shipping will take approximately 40% of the funds we receive, and 10% goes to Kickstarter for hosting the campaign.\nAny extra money we earn from the campaign will help pay for future issues of House of Fear.\n Meet the Creators \nWill You Help Us Make Comics for Kids?\nIt's simple: We love making fun, exciting comics, and we want to get them to as many readers as I possibly can. We can't do that without support from readers like you.\nThank you for checking out our latest project. We hope you find a reward that suits you well, and when you do, that you back the campaign and help us continue making exciting, action-packed comics for kids.\nThank you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my FIFTH Kickstarter campaign! The comic is already complete, and all we have left to do is print the comic and other rewards. \n\nWe're big fans of the Kickstarter platform, and we know how important it is for backers to get their rewards in a timely manner.

Details below. ]\n This week's cover story in Comic Shop News! \n The year is 1969. Ramsey is an aspiring comic book artist who is trying to find inspiration for his femme fatale. When he meets wild dancer, Regina, at a street fair he invites her into the woods for a character photoshoot where she begins to break on through to the other side. Witness the psycho-delic origin of the most powerful character in the Hero Tomorrow Comics universe. Issue 1 of a mind-bending 4 issue journey to reshape your reality!\nDouble sized first issue with 48 pages (40 story pages) full color, glossy paper.\nAll physical orders will include a signed print by Ted Sikora.\nPage production is complete - Shipping in Late March 2021.\nSurvey will give you option to have them signed for FREE.\n Exclusive Cover variants only available through this campaign.\nAll four issues of this series will come out in 2021.\n\nTed Sikora (writer/creator/colorist/letterer) is a Cleveland/Akron based comic book writer and filmmaker. He is the president of Hero Tomorrow Comics, and the creator/writer/letterer of Tap Dance Killer andPunchline & the Vaude-Villains, and creator/co-writer/colorist/letterer of Apama The Undiscovered Animal. As a filmmaker he directed the indie feature Hero Tomorrow and hundreds of shorts in realms of documentary, music videos, and education. He wrote the libretto, principle music and lyrics for the horror show musical Nothing Like Vaudeville. \nButch Mapa (artist) is a professional illustrator and graphic novelist with a decade of experience, currently illustrating Marvel's Action Avengers through IDW, He's done work for Zenescope, Top Shelf, Image, Upper Deck, and many others.  \nWhy Crowdfunding?\nFirst, there's nothing better than having a direct connection to readers. I'm honored to have had that experience through conventions and Kickstarter over the past decade. Some of the most touching moments in my life have come from people telling me they see themselves in a character that I created. Also the interaction online with you helps shape these campaigns. It undoubtedly makes me a better creator, which hopefully  enhances the experience for you with each go 'round.\nSecondly, BLOOM was actually solicited in the Previews Guide catalog in April of 2020, but due to the massive covid shutdown, that particular catalog was barely distributed. We had to pull it because it would have had no chance. Our business model relies heavily on comic conventions, and without cons we would simply lose money on every release. The Kickstarter platform is like a virtual comic con, and we can do things on it we can't even do at conventions. (like pick your shirt color and CGCs.)\nAs the industry changes we're trying to change with it.  I heartily thank you for supporting the indies and making this moment possible.  \n\n PREVIEW PAGES\nThank you so much for checking out our campaign. \nTed Sikora\nSTRETCH & MILESTONE REWARDS\n $5000 [Unlocked] - Holy Waters (song MP3) by Captain Future \n 100 Backers [Unlocked] - Deadskins #1 PDF \n$7000 [Unlocked] - Eder Messias interior Pinup Page\n 200 Backers [Unlocked] - Nook #1 PDF \n $8000 [Unlocked] - Apama The Undiscovered Animal #1 PDF (With Hero Tomorrow Comics Cover Gallery) \n$9000 [Unlocked] Up From The Skies #1 PDF\n $10,000 [Unlocked] Tap Dance Killer #1 and #2 PDF Origin of Punchline \n 300 Backers [Unlocked]  Voodoo Nations #1 Deluxe PDF \n $11,000 [UnLocked] Neil Zaza MP3 \n $12,500 [UnLocked] Photocover Variant will have a second cover image of Alicia Lynn as Regina on the back!

My name's Jeff McClelland, and I write books like The Tick and the Kickstarter-funded Black Terror: Social Insecurity. In 2020, I funded the just-shipped Planet Comics #1 right here on Kickstarter.

You can order just the regular cover, or both at the same time.\nIn addition, everyone who pledges at the $8 level or above will get a copy of an electronic \"making of\" publication, with a behind-the-scenes look a the creation of this issue.

It tells the story of high school senior Elliot Morgan: a massive comic fan with graduation and Major Voltage Adventures on his mind, when he's astonished to discover he has superhuman abilities of his own. \nWhen he almost immediately goes out and makes a public display of his new superheroic abilities, he's amazed to be confronted by his favourite comic book characters staring him down in the real world. As if that wasn't crazy enough, they reveal the truth about themselves - they're his parents and they reveal that they are refugees from the world of his favourite comic book escaped to this world when he was just a baby. \nWhat follows is revelation after revelation, after more and more of the family's secrets come to light. Just how many secrets can one family be keeping?\nThe Miracle Family by Luciano Vecchio\nElliot Morgan aka Miracle design by Vince Underwood\nElliot Morgan a.k.a. Miracle - Elliot is an average teen boy, and a bit of a geek. He\u2019s an outward optimist but harbours within him some anger. Elliot's anger seems to revolve around the idea that so much about himself was kept secret from him, but there's more that he's keeping inside himself. He is a believer in taking a responsibility for his home with his new capabilities, and with those newfound reality-warping abilities, there's little that he can't do.\nAyden Morgan a.k.a. Empath design by Vince Underwood\nAyden Morgan a.k.a. Empath - Elliot\u2019s younger in age but bigger in size brother, Ayden is much more quiet, introverted and sullen than Elliot. Ayden has been dealing with intense mental health issues, that may be connected to his empathic abilities, and he has to learn to come to terms and learn to live with them.\nEvan Morgan a.k.a. Major Voltage design by Vince Underwood\nEvan Morgan a.k.a. Major Voltage - Elliot\u2019s father, Evan was his world\u2019s leading superhero. Proud, tough, but with a warm, open heart, he\u2019s always been troubled by the fact he and his wife kept their kids\u2019 true nature from them. Defending his family has been his sole purpose since taking refuge in this world, so he now has a less ostentatious profession than 'superhero' to help stay hidden. However, he holds some pride in his son taking up his old line of work.\nKate Morgan a.k.a. Ms Phantom design by Vince Underwood\nKate Morgan a.k.a. Ms. Phantom - Kate is Elliot and Ayden\u2019s mother, and is the one responsible for hiding their true natures from them using her telepathy. She\u2019s almost the opposite of Evan in that she\u2019s quieter, seems sadder, and the escape to their new home and what it led to took its toll. However, she is fiercely protective of her family, and would go to any length for them.\nJessica Lectron a.k.a. Superia design by Vince Underwood\nJessica Morgan a.k.a. Superia - Elliot\u2019s cousin, Evan\u2019s niece, Superia was another great hero of their home reality. She was bright, bushy tailed and brash, but in the \u2018real\u2019 world has become more serious, grimmer and reserved. Much of this comes from the trauma of the move over to the new world, and she has withdrawn from the main family significantly, implying there might be more to her pull away from both the family and from her previous life as a superhero than is known.\nElliot Morgan is your average teenage outcast, keeping his head down as best he can to get through High School. One thing that's been a source of comfort to him all his life has been his love of comic books, particularly one comic book: the mysterious final issue of Major Voltage Adventures. An issue written by a reclusive British comics writer, that sees the heroes in a tense stand-off with their arch-nemesis Maestro during a reality-shattering Catastrophe. The story is left unresolved and is a major topic of debate and theorising for decades. Elliot doesn't know why he's so obsessed with it, but it's the one comic he comes back to read again and again. \nThen one day, the strangest thing happens: Elliot starts exhibiting unnatural, superhuman abilities. From there, Elliot's world is turned upside down, with revelation after revelation, not least of which being his parents are Major Voltage and Ms Phantom, and his family came to this world from the fictional world of his favourite comic book. \nSuperia designs by Andrew Sebastien Kwan\nNow deciding to use his great gifts for good in the 'real' world, just how will that work for a superhuman refugee from a comic book? And what other skeletons are the Morgans keeping in their closet?\nWe're going for a mix of soap opera drama and large scale superhero action adventure. Think The OC crossed with The Incredibles. Fantastic Four mixed with 13 Reasons Why. This Is Us meets X-Men, by way of Invincible. \nEmpath/Ayden design by Zoe Thorogood\nThe Miracles is a story I've been working on and wanting to tell since I started writing The Pride. The Miracles has been a comic series, a book, a mini-series, and over the years I've worked with numerous artists to develop the idea including Gavin Mitchell, Kris Anka, Zoe Thorogood and Andrew Sebastian Kwan. Now, having found the perfect team to finally make this project a reality, we'll bring it out as an Original Graphic Novel so everyone can finally have this tale of families, broken realities and the secrets we keep. While we touch on a number of issues including refugees, the role of a hero in the world, personal responsibility to one's home, whether born there or found, the main core remains family and secrets. \nOriginal Character Designs/Sketch by Kris Anka\nJoe Glass - Writer\nJOE GLASS - Writer - Joe is the writer and creator of LGBTQ+ superhero team series, The Pride. Originally self-published, The Pride was the first ComiXology Submit title that got upgraded and continued as a ComiXology Originals series. He's also released superhero political thriller Acceptable Losses and glitter noir, queer grindhouse revenge fantasy, Glitter Vipers. A staunch advocate for inclusion and representation in comics, Joe does whatever he can to make that happen. Joe lives in South Wales, UK with a belligerent cat named Oliver. You can follow him on twitter and YouTube. \n\nVince Underwood - Artist\nVINCE UNDERWOOD - Artist - Vince is an American comic book artist. His credits include Elk Mountain and Page Turn (both available on Comixology). He has also done comics work for transmedia horror company Cold Room Entertainment and illustrated for NBC Sports and the San Francisco Giants. Vince lives with and by the grace of his wonderful wife Hannah, their two dogs Cassie and Millie, and their cat Derek. You can follow him on twitter. \n\nHARRY SAXON - Colours - Harry is an illustrator and comics colourist from Greece. He is currently 38 years old and irreversibly trans. You might know his work from titles such as Vault Comics\u2019 Vagrant Queen and its successor Vagrant Queen: A Planet Called Doom and Test and Black Mask\u2019s Sex Death Revolution. If you don\u2019t know his work, this is an excellent way of getting started. You can check his website and follow him on twitter. Friendship and discounts offered if you\u2019re into Doctor Who.\nHASSAN OTSMANE-ELHAOU - Letters - Hassan is a British/Algerian letterer of comics. He's worked on things like Quantum & Woody, Undone by Blood and First Knife. He's also the voice behind Strip Panel Naked, and the editor of the Eisner-winning PanelxPanel magazine. You can follow him on twitter and YouTube. \n\nWe'll also have a cover by amazing artist, the fabulous Kevin Wada, and the logo has been designed by the incomparable Dominic Xavier Crewe.\nCover Artwork by Kevin Wada\nThe book is still being made as we speak and raise funds, and we are planning/expecting to have it ready for release and posting to backers for the third quarter of 2021, looking at October 2021. We're about 10% complete as of now, and are on schedule to hit this goal. \nWe want as many people as possible to be able to get and read The Miracles. As such, we are keeping a cheaper digital option available for those on a budget who still want to read our action-packed, amazing superhero family story. \nMock-up for the Kickstarter Exclusive Hardcover edition\nWe also want collectors to feel like there's something extra special for them too. As such, there'll be a very limited edition hardcover version of the book, for those that want something a bit more special to sit on their shelves, that will be exclusively available to Kickstarter backers. Containing the 120 pages of story, plus further behind the scenes pages and designs, creating an overall book size of 160 pages!\nSPECS:- 282 x 185mm hardcover, 160 pages plus end pages and cover, matt lamination outer cover, 170GSM uncoated endpapers, 130GSM silk main pages, full colour throughout\nMock-up for trade paperback edition\nOn a larger print run, we'll have a trade paperback version available too, filled with the 120 page story, plus extras and more, such as design work and sketches making for a 140 page book. \nSPECS:- 282 x 185mm trade paperback, 140 pages, 300GSM silk and matt laminated cover, 130GSM silk internal pages, full colour throughout\nSticker\nWe'll also be making a sticker of the main The Miracles logo, so this will be available on a number of rewards tiers.\nEnamel Pin\nThere's also an enamel pin, of a stylised version of the series' emblem. A nice, shiny little mark of being in The Miracles Family. \nThere are also a couple of retailer tiers too, so if you are a store and would like five or even ten copies at a discount price, please check out those tiers! NB: It will be the TPB version of the book in those tiers, the hardcover is Exclusive to the Kickstarter only. \nWe even have been given access by Kickstarter to allow ADD ONS, which will include some of my back catalogue of titles, including superhero political thriller Acceptable Losses; glitter noir queer grindhouse revenge fantasy Glitter Vipers; and the last few copies of the original, limited edition self-published The Pride collection, collecting the first ten comics made before the series was picked up by ComiXology Originals. \nThis is a BIG project, possibly one of the biggest I've ever done, and so we need all the help we can get to cover this. The total of this campaign goes to paying the creative team to make the art and design, and to cover printing costs and delivery. It's a high goal, but with enough support, we can do it.\nWe're also teaming with a fulfilment company in the US to help bring down costs for international backers, and speed up fulfilment too! White Squirrel will be helping us deliver speedily and cost effectively, handling the US backers. I've found that the largest part of my audience is based in America, so I've taken this measure to help keep postage costs as low as possible for the region, as well as helping me keep costs down for all other regions too.\nA rough breakdown of how the funds are distributed\n\nMost of the money raised is going on production on the book, specifically the art team. The next biggest chunk will be for printing and postage. These are big expenses, and always increasing, but with your help, we can do it. \nIf we manage to surpass our goal, we'll look into Stretch Goals too, but for now, our main focus is hitting our goal. \nI am so excited about this story and bringing it to you all, I think it's one of the strongest stories I've ever created. \nBut don't just take my word for it! Check out some early pages below!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be my third campaign run during the pandemic, as well as my ninth campaign overall, so by now I have a lot of experience with running these things. \n\nThat being said, postage/shipping is something that can often catch people out, myself included in the past. So, for this campaign, being my biggest campaign to date, I've partnered with a fulfilment company to handle the US backers, which will also mean we can keep the price down for those international backers that are the most expensive to ship from the UK too. \n\nLife factors can sometimes delay production, even in the midst of lockdowns and the like.

Were you into college radio? Were you even born? Were you a college DJ, or a student station manager? Experience the era that ignited a new music revolution thanks to the blood, spit, and bravado of college radio. Post-Punk! Synth Pop! New Wave! & Indie/Alternative get the 4-color comic book treatment in HEAVY ROTATION, a love letter to '80s college radio.\nPOWER. CORRUPTION. COLLEGE RADIO!\nIn the mid \u201880s, a group of reckless teenagers converged on an upstate New York college town to study the fine art of Communications. These shy social misfits & miscreants became DJs at the perfect moment in college radio history: when album-oriented Top 40 rock was kicked to the curb. \ncover art & logo by Philip Bond (not final)\n Armed with neon rubber bracelets, exploding tubes of black eyeliner, and big hair, this cadre of culture vultures ushered in \u201cNew Music,\u201d a combination of punk, new wave, new romantic, goth, and indie/alternative. They played the hell out of Adam and the Ants, Violent Femmes, The Clash, The Smiths, New Order, and The Cure. Their lives -- and the upstate NY college town of Ithaca -- were forever changed.  \nDJs Heather, Brother Mike (animated), Glenn and Barbra circa 1985.\n30+ years later these college DJs (still music-obsessed but, strangely, not much older) have reconvened to celebrate '80s college radio in HEAVY ROTATION, a 48-page anthology of short comics, prose & single illustrations, essays and interviews with an impressive lineup of comic book artists.\nPage 1 of a 5-page short story written by Shelly Bond and illustrated by Mark Stafford.\nYou'll find out the answers to these burning questions and more:  \n+ What\u2019s up with the ancient analog tech like reel-to-reel machines and promo carts?\n+ What is the FCC and how did it impact our fun on college radio?\n+ What's the perfect segue?\n+ Why do audio majors run around campus with razor blades?\n+ What is this \"dot\" rotation system and who determined these maddening rules?\n+ Does \"Dead Air\" actually kill you?\n+ What does a college DJ actually do?\n+ How did we find out about cool new bands \u2013 and old ones who had a huge catalog that was an undiscovered planet waiting to be explored?\n\nA lot of the time, the answer was college radio.\n92 WICB ITHACA, THE STATION FOR INNOVATION\nIt was, and is, the FCC licensed radio station operated by students from Ithaca College, broadcasting 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\nDJ Mike Sauter and an illustration of Brother Mike Cohen by Rodd Perry.\nProse story in progress written by Barbra Baker with illustrations by A.D. Puchalski.\nIt was indeed an aural adventure to have access to a local college radio station, where you could hear British punk & new wave, '70s era Bowie, Kate Bush, Heaven 17, and local bands you couldn\u2019t see live if you were underage.\nBut even better: being a DJ on a college radio station during the golden era of college radio--when indie was truly indie and before \u201calternative\u201d was a cash cow.\nCollege DJ Glenn Raucher showing off a favorite album on his specialty show, The Musical Box.\n\u2019There was something reassuring about placing a needle on a record,\" says college DJ Glenn Raucher. \"And, if you did your job right, hearing sound, even with the pops, clicks, and hisses that it often entailed.\"\n\nTHE REWARDS\nTHE COMIC BOOK\nChock-full of short comics, single illustration and prose, essays, and other illuminating tales, this anthology comic is 48 full-color pages.\nAvailable digitally and in print.\n\nTHE SWAG BAG\n2 pin badges! 2 postcards! 2 vinyl stickers! \nArtwork not final.\nTHE BREAKDOWN\nIf we go beyond our modest target goal, we'll be able to add and unlock stretch goals and hopefully pay our contributors what they're worth.\nHere's how the funds will be allocated:\nWhere the money goes...\nTHE FADE OUT\nHEAVY ROTATION is a 48-page love letter to '80s college radio, collecting the shared experiences of a group of people who grew up together left of the dial \u2014 and are still connected three decades later. It will appeal to anyone whose favorite band eluded the mainstream, anyone who loved the \u201980s, and everyone who loves someone who loved the \u201880s.\n\nSpearheaded by veteran DC/Vertigo and Black Crown comic book editor and former college DJ Shelly Bond, HEAVY ROTATION is brought to you by former WICB DJs/current professional writers, DJs, tech ops directors, teachers, home schoolers, and an all-star lineup of artists including Philip Bond (Kill Your Boyfriend, Eve Stranger), Michael Allred (Bowie: Stardust, Rayguns & Moonage Daydreams, Silver Surfer), Kitty Curran (Taylor Swift: Girl Detective), A.D. Puchalski (Insider Art),  Mark Stafford (Lip Hook), and Rachael Smith (Quarantine Comix), who are connected by one thing: \nA mutual admiration for cool music and the power, corruption and glory of being an FCC-license toting college DJ.\nPage 2 work-in-progress of \"Seventh Dream of Heavy Rotation\" by Shelly Bond & Mark Stafford.\n\"I've spent my life caught in a tumultuous war between my love for comics and music,\" said editor Shelly Bond, \"Which is why my indie work often combines the two. I hope you'll join us in creating this 4-color sequential portal back to the mid \u201880s, when the only music that mattered was the music we played on our radio shifts.\"", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAssembling a comic during COVID isn\u2019t difficult if you know how it\u2019s done.

Most tend to be concerned not with creating a better world but merely defending the status quo, not to mention all the flat-out reactionary takes on the genre!\nThe solution? BEEF BROS, an eye-searing, gonzo comic about Huey and Ajax Beef, a pair of neighborhood heroes willing to brawl with sadistic police, cruel landlords, and predatory corporations not because of any complicated college-boy theorizing, but because helping people out is simply the right thing to do. \nImagine Noam Chomsky\u2019s Heroes for Hire meeting Peter Kropotkin\u2019s Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure.

Wild adventures I could get lost in as I followed the heroes along on their journey. Middle Earth, Hyboria, The Young Kingdoms, The Dying Earth. To me, it's not escapism to want to dwell in worlds like that for a little while. The wonderful thing about fiction, especially genre fiction is that it gives you a taste of the impossible - a window into another world. And that feeling, that exhilarating feeling of cracking open a book and getting lost in it, even for a moment, is something that I've always wanted to create for someone else. And I believe that Wailing Blade is a book that will.\nIt's often said that you should make the comics that you want to see in the world. In that respect, Wailing Blade is everything we've ever wanted to see in a comic. It's got action, it's got adventure. Compelling characters, and a lush, vibrant world for them to inhabit.

Now, there seems to a cult dedicated to following the killer's methods and believing that the killer is some kind of messiah meant to free them and bring judgment to others. \n\nWhat's the story?\nDON'T EVER BLINK Chapter 2 is the second issue of a 5-issue limited horror comic book series about a woman who survives a harrowing and horrific ordeal, the massacre of her fiance and his family, but not without her being scarred for life in more than one way; Tinsley Marissa Grace is found alive but her eyelids have been sewn shut -- a calling card of a killer that has eluded authorities before and now has returned. \nThe Second Chapter is about Tinsley looking for answers and the lengths that she will go to find them. However, the small town of Billesbrooke, VA is less than giving, and the detectives on the case may no more than their letting on as the killer's cult becomes more of a problem. \nWho will like this?\nHorror comic book fans.\nHorror/Slasher/Psychological thriller movie fans.\nB-movie enthusiasts.\nBefore you back DON'T EVER BLINK Chapter 2, check out some of the rewards that we have to offer.

Murder books typically include crime scene photographs and sketches, autopsy and forensic reports, transcripts of investigator\u2019s notes and witness interviews. They chronicle the life of a case, from the time the murder is reported until an arrest is made.\nCATCH & RELEASE: A MURDER BOOK STORY is an original graphic novel about crime and consequence. It\u2019s written by me, Ed Brisson (Old Man Logan, Uncanny X-Men), and lusciously illustrated by Lisandro Estherren (Redneck, Strange Skies of East Berlin). This stand-alone graphic novel will be published in an exclusive hardcover edition for Kickstarter backers.\nCover by Lisandro Estherren\nAfter nearly half a decade away from writing crime comics -- a genre I love more than any other -- I\u2019m making a return with the Kickstarter Exclusive Hardcover edition of CATCH & RELEASE: A MURDER BOOK STORY. This book is near and dear to my heart, and probably the most pure distillation of the kind of book that I want to write.\n\nCATCH & RELEASE: A MURDER BOOK STORY is about a thief who concocts a plan to sell a stolen car not once, but several times, by luring unsuspecting buyers to a remote location and robbing them at gunpoint. His plan hits a snag when he encounters a student, who needs a fresh set of wheels to travel to his new life out West. When things go south, they go south hard, and now our car thief stands on a precipice where he has to make a choice that will affect not only his life, but that of his co-conspirator and their two victims. The story is an examination of one man\u2019s guilt and how far he\u2019s willing to go to stay out of jail. \nArt by Lisandro Estherren\nWhen I started writing the script -- the longest MURDER BOOK story to date -- I knew that there was only one artist who could do it justice: Lisandro Estherren. He and I had previously worked together on THE LAST CONTRACT for BOOM! Studios and have been looking for an excuse to team up once again. Thankfully, he was into the story and happy to come aboard to breathe life into this story about a deception and redemption.\nArt by Lisandro Estherren\n\nTHE TEAM\nEd Brisson has been creating comics in one form or another since 1994. He\u2019s best known for his work at Marvel on books such as UNCANNY X-MEN, IRON FIST, GHOST RIDER, OLD MAN LOGAN and X-FORCE. He also has a long history of writing creator-owned books such as COMEBACK (Image), SHELTERED (Image), THE LAST CONTRACT (BOOM!) and THE VIOLENT (Image).\n\nEd first started to gain recognition from his self-published series MURDER BOOK, which was collected and released by Dark Horse in 2015.\nLisandro Estherren is a comic artist based in Argentina. His work includes graphic novels, series, and illustration for publishers and magazines such as Editorial Pictus (Argentina), Aurea Editoriale (Italy) Di\u00e1bolo (Spain) and Mojito (Uruguay). In the US, he has produced series for Red5 Comics (Spook) and BOOM! Studios (The Last Contract). He is currently working on REDNECK for Skybound Comics.\nHassan Otsmane-Elhaou makes Strip Panel Naked, a YouTube series focusing on breaking down comic art. He also does this a lot on his twitter (@HassanOE). He might make films that you'd like.\nLinney Incorporated is run by editor/writer/producer Nate Cosby, who's worked on Cow Boy, Thor The Mighty Avenger, Red Sonja, Jim Henson's The Storyteller, World War Hulk, Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane, James Bond, The Wonderful World Of Oz, Flash Gordon and sooooooooo many more books.\n\nWHY KICKSTARTER\nI\u2019ve been a fan of the Kickstarter publishing method for years now and have always wanted to bring a project here, where we can cut out the middleman and create a book for readers, backed by readers.\n\nKickstarter allows Lisandro and I to maintain complete control over the story and production of the book, creating a work that is as purely a product of our love for the genre and medium.\n\nThe money raised through this campaign will be used to pay the creative team and for printing of the hardcover book.\n\nWHAT YOU CAN GET\nWe are delighted to print this stand alone story in a Kickstarter exclusive deluxe hardcover, as well as a digital edition of the book. CATCH & RELEASE: A MURDER BOOK STORY is a 72 page book, printed at standard comic size (6.625 x 10.25 inches).\n\nAside from the book itself, we have plenty of fun rewards including commissions from Declan Shalvey and Micheal Walsh; script reviews from Matthew Rosenberg and Kelly Thompson; original artwork; and even a chance to appear in the book yourself!\n\nA NOTE ON SHIPPING\nBecause of how quickly shipping rates can change and the unexpected nature of the world, shipping costs will be added on later, when we ship the book out to you in 2021. You will get a survey from BackerKit where you will be asked for your address, and shipping costs will be calculated at that point. We will do the best we can to make shipping as affordable as possible. Our current shipping estimates are as follows (but these may change if shipping rates increase): $4 US  / $10 Canada / $25 EU, GB and elsewhere. \nCanadian orders will ship from Canada, all other orders will ship from the US.\nTHANK YOU!\nThank you to our families and readers for getting us this far!\nKickstarter Campaign Manager: \nLaser Malena-Webber lasercampaigns.com\nMusic credit for video:\nDoomsday Clock by Rafael Krux\nLink: https://filmmusic.io/song/5402-doomsday-clock-\nLicense: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAny project has its risks in creation, manufacturing delays, and the unexpectedness of the world.

My name is Jeff McComsey! I am a cartoonist, writer and educator making comics for the past 13 years. \nYou fine backers have always helped me print a mess of these Thumb Books for a lot of cartoonists, designers, students... and, well I ran out of them... again.  \nWith your help I hope to finance a new run of Thumb Books and share them with OG backers and new backers alike.\n\nWHERE IT ALL STARTED:\nLike most cartoonists and comic artists, I did my thumbnails on loose paper and I would inevitably lose them in the sea of paper in my studio. My initial solution was an improvised thumbnail template stapled together. I\u2019ve been refining Thumb Book over the years and this will be the fourth official printing.\nSPECS:\nThe THUMB BOOK is 4\u201dx 5.5\u201dand is currently 60 pages.\n-Designed to be a pocket sized sketch book with a template on each page that corresponds to the layout of a standard comic page, but one that is adaptable to other formats as well.\n Originally created to help me keep all my preliminary work in one spot, I also like them because I can grab a script, pencil, Thumb Book and hit a coffee shop if I need a change of scenery.\nHOW I USE THEM:\n Some of my finished pages I ink and pencil digitally, but I always start with a pencil and Thumb Book.\n BREAKDOWNS \nOnce I have a script in hand I do small breakdowns four up on the Thumb Book page. Here I'm mostly focusing on leaving enough room for lettering and making sure speaking order is reflected in layout.\nTHUMBNAILS\n After that each breakdown gets taken to a full (Thumb Book) page layout. I try and make those thumbnails as tight as possible. I then scan those thumbnails and enlarge them to begin the penciling stage.\nSCANS\nOnce I scan in my thumbs and make a spread out of them, I'll share them with editorial or any other creative partners on the project. This also let's me look at stories as a whole and see if I'm repeating a layout too much.\n\nWHO ELSE USES THESE?\nThe Thumb Book is pocket size and perfect for anyone that needs a handy sketch book for that crucial design stage where you brainstorm with a pencil. \n-3D piece concepts\n-Storyboards (there's board/ratio conversion specs in the back of the Thumb Book)\n-Landscaping concepts\n-Good for comic writers to help visualize pages while scripting.\n\n\n REWARDS:\nI've added some of my original art and signed books to help make this a successful campaign.\n **NOTE: Backers will select their book via the survey section after funding.\n FRIENDS OF THE CAMPAIGN!\n\nCLICK HERE TO CHECK IT OUT!\nWailing Blade is high-adrenaline fantasy adventure, set in the dark future of mankind.

He hit skid row, but was starting to make a comeback when he was kidnapped by a bizarre troupe of scoundrels calling themselves the Vaude-Villains.

For the entire year he was in prison, I sent him postcards where I talked about the weather, being free to go outside whenever I liked, how nice New York was in the Spring, and sometimes snarked at him for how bad things were going in the country - but the one thing I always included were movie and TV spoilers, knowing he probably didn't have access to new movies and premium TV shows (everything from HBO to Netflix to Amazon Prime.)  And I decided to put them all together in a book for you to see.\nTruth be told, I took pictures of the cards before I even decided I'd collect them into a book for you fine folks.  When I showed them to Sean Von Gorman, my longtime friend in comics, he decided we should probably imagine how Michael was probably reacting to the spoilers, hence the artist renderings.  This added a whole new element of humor to the idea for the book, and schadenfreude, in general.\nSo, obviously, spoiler alerts abound for everyone (except Michael Cohen.)\nsample page from the book\nIn retrospect, maybe I did him a favor by spoiling the God-awful rushed ending of Game of Thrones.\nWhy this?  \nFor years, I did prisoner support for folks arrested for political activism, and what I learned is this:  by far the main drawbacks of US prison life are the boredom and the loneliness; and I learned mail is cherished as a lifeline to the outside world.  So I figured there was a better than average chance Mike was reading my cards, despite the spoilers.\nWhat do you have against Michael Cohen?\nI know he's trying to clean up his reputation now that he's been caught, but Michael Cohen is a big part of why we are where we are now in the United States.  I land on the political spectrum somewhere around \"polar opposite of Donald Trump\", and I saw Cohen lie, cheat, and bully his way for Trump during the 2016 campaign cycle.  He's no friend of ours - but because his attempts to throw Trump under the bus were admirable (and backfired spectacularly) I went a gentle-trolling route, rather than invoking the churning cauldron of anger in my gut I have for this administration.\nsample page from the book\nThis is so dumb.\nI know.  But it helped me cope a little with what's going on in the country, and I think it's more dumb fun than just dumb.  In fact, I think it's a lot of fun.  I hope you agree.\nWho are you people?\nI'm a comic book writer and animal rescuer based out of NYC.  Sean is a comic book artist, also from NYC, and Matt Krotzer is a graphic designer and comic letterer who lives out in Amish country in PA.\nI've run several successful Kickstarters both solo and as collaborations with others - between us all, we've run and fulfilled over 10 book Kickstarters, so pledge with confidence.\nsample page from the book\nWhat can I get?!  I want to spoil myself (and/or others!)\nimage for example purpose only - everyone's \"Sad Michael Cohen\" art will be a one-of-a-kind imagining, original piece of art.\nWhat'll the money be used for?\nThe money will be used for paying everyone who worked on the book, like artists, editors, and designers - plus printing, shipping, and more.

This is particularly important for people of marginalized genders who might not have access to other inclusive places with like-minded individuals, which means it's specifically important to provide assistance to comic book stores owned, operated, and staffed by women and people of marginalized genders.\nThat's where INSIDER ART came in. Developed by Shelly Bond, INSIDER ART assembled 150 women and non-binary comics creators from around the world. This 270-page digital anthology raised over $5K on Gumroad, with all of the proceeds benefiting 28 retailers who reached out for support. And now with your help, we want to bring a softcover version of the book to everyone. \nWhile the digital version of INSIDER ART will remain exclusively on Gumroad, we've had many requests for a softcover for people who prefer a paperback reading experience. With your help, we'll be able to provide this astounding 4-color compendium for print-lovers to enjoy and as a bonus, pay the 150 creatives who generously donated their time and talents.\n\"...a joyous celebration of graphic narrative in a multiplicity of forms...much of the appeal of INSIDER ART is in rooting through its eclectic treasure chest of graphic gems...INSIDER ART could be considered one of the key releases of 2020.\" \n \u2014Andy Oliver, Broken Frontier\nChock-full of comics, crafts, and cats, INSIDER ART was designed to entertain readers of all ages who are stuck indoors or just in search of new creative outlets.

Each room is filled with comics, prose, and projects individually curated by a team of eight editors designed to inspire readers and remind everyone why being inside isn't so bad.\n From recipes for comfort food and quarantine bread...\n...to attic treasures and a brief history of Garage Rock, INSIDER ART is guaranteed to conquer the tedium of the great indoors.\nIntroducing our 150 amazing contributors:\nAbby Jame Abs Bailey Anna Puchalski Amalia DeGirolamo Aimee Garcia AJ Mendez Amanda Gonzalez Andrea Rosales Andrea Shockling Angela Cleland Anja Venter Anne Toole Annie Wu Arlene Lo Ashley Ribblett Becca Carey Becky Cloonan Beth Wood Billie Temple Caitlyn Yarsky Carolyn Carter Carrie McNinch Casey Gilly Cat Sims Cathy Brett Cecil Castellucci Celeste Bronfman Ceridwen Gale Brown Chiara Bautista Chrissy Williams Christa Miesner Chynna Clugston Flores Cindy Whitehead Corinna Bechko dANI!

MSB fans from all over the world clamored for more stories, more adventures staring the Church's swift arm of justice that protected the flock from the gathering wolves!   \nSo Metalshark Bro co-creators Kevin Cuffe and Bob Frantz put their heads together and cooked up a few ideas for short stories. The duo invited Metalshark Bro editor Chas! Pangburn (who is a great writer) to submit a story and wa-la! The dudes had 30 some odd pages of Ninja Nun Stories broken into 4 short stories. Scripts are cool but ART is better! Kevin, Chas, and Bob contacted a few of their favorite artists and BAM! They got themselves a comic book.\nNow that you know a bit about the backstory, we can tell you about the book. Ninja Nuns: Bad Habits Die Hard will feature a Kickstarter exclusive cover By Dann Franco and will only be made available via this campaign. This version of the book will not be made available in comic book shops. \nEach book will be signed and numbered by co-creator and writer Bob Frantz. \nThe amazingly talented and dare I say handsome writer Chas! Pangburn (too many credit to list because Chas! is so prolific, RIP you and ME on webtoons), artist Tony Gregori (Vault, Dark Horse, Lucha Underground), and colorist Josh Jensen up to tell the tale of a hard-luck fellow meddling with forces he doesn't understand.\nLines by Tony Gregori colors by Josh Jensen\nLine by Tony Gregori/Colors by Josh Jensen\nLines by Tony Gregori/Colors by Josh Jensen\n\nDann Franco, Bob Frantz, and Gabriel Calfa kick out the jams in a short story about a spooky DJ looking to throw a party of biblical proportions. \nLines by Dann Franco/Colors bt Gabriel Calfa\nLine art by Dann Franco/Colors by Gabriel Calfa\nLines by Dann Franco.

You may (or may not) know me from such comics as GRUMBLE (from Albatross Funnybooks), MODERN FANTASY (from Dark Horse Comics), HARBINGER or ARCHER AND ARMSTRONG (from Valiant Entertainment), or the internet-famous THANOS AND DARKSEID: CARPOOL BUDDIES OF DOOM. But, right now, I'm here to tell you about NIGHTMARE THE RAT.\nNIGHTMARE THE RAT is a mischievous little monster who preys upon the populace of Hell City by stealing their teeth. I began drawing his comics in 2010 and released a collection in 2014. Since then, I've been working diligently to complete Nightmare's tale. That day has finally arrived.\nThis Kickstarter is meant to raise the funds to publish the second, and final, NIGHTMARE THE RAT collection. \nNIGHTMARE THE RAT - The NEW collection!\nAbout the collection:\nNIGHTMARE THE RAT is an homage to early 1900s comics and the collected editions reflect that influence. This 32-page collection will be printed oversized (10.5\"x16\") on good old-fashioned newsprint with bonus comics and a sketchbook. It's the same format as the first collection, so they'll look great together! \nPut them side-by-side! They look great together!\nThis second collection completes Nightmare's tale, concluding with a finale that might be the most messed-up thing I've ever drawn. It is creepy and hilarious and unlike any other comic you have ever read.\nSeriously. What the hell is this about?\nNightmare the Rat is a demon who steals people's teeth, forcibly sometimes.\nHis nemesis is a tiny owl named Morningbreath who poops in people's mouths.\nThe mayor and his goon squad are always trying to take Nightmare down!\nAlso, there's a cult and some kind of apocalyptic prophecy???\nYou can currently read most of Nightmare's adventures online, however, the collected editions are the intended reading experience. \nWhat kind of rewards are there?\nBeyond the collection itself, we are also offering...\nEnamel Pins! \n1\" enamel pin, complete with collector card!\nMini-Prints! \nNINE postcard-sized prints! By Kelly Williams, Giles Crawford, Jason Axtell, John Shine, Matt Dembicki, Steve Becker, Brett Uren, Jacob Warrenfeltz, and Chris Maranac!\nSketch-covers! \nI have a ton of blank covers to draw on. Let me draw something for YOU!\nOriginal art! \nNightmare the Rat \"daily\" strips. 2 strips per 14x17\" page!\nThe cover illustration!? Wow!\nHow far along is this project?\nAll  of the comics are drawn and ready to go. I still need to put together the back cover, but that'll go quick. By the time this campaign ends, all I'll have left to do is send the files to the  printer.\nHow will this money be used?\nI'm the only creator involved with NIGHTMARE THE RAT, and I don't expect to make much off of this. All of the money raised will go towards printing the newspaper collection and shipping out your rewards. Anything extra will go into printing more copies and possible stretch rewards. (More info on stretch goals and rewards  is forthcoming.) ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs mentioned before, all the comics are drawn and the bonus material is almost finished.

This anthology title featured futuristic stories of heroic adventurers with a mid-century aesthetic, and it is well-loved to this day, often for its lush, high-quality, imaginative covers. Just look at this winner from issue 71: \nPlanet Comics #71 from 1953\nHey everyone! My name\u2019s Jeff McClelland, and I write comics like The Tick and the 2019 Kickstarter-funded Black Terror: Social Insecurity. With this new iteration of Planet Comics, I\u2019d like to tell fun, imaginative stories under a sci-fi umbrella. To that end, I\u2019ve asked some of my friends to help out and I\u2019m really happy with the result. If you agree, then I hope you\u2019ll help us send this issue to print! If the campaign for this first issue is successful, I\u2019d like to publish a total of four issues on a (roughly) quarterly schedule.\nAs an added throwback, this issue will be presented in an oversized, magazine format, leaving lots of room for wide landscapes and immersive action!\nThe book\nSo what\u2019ll be included in this first issue? First, we\u2019ve got \u201cThe Bulwark\u201d, from myself and artist Andrea Schiavone. This story will be the book\u2019s continuing feature, told in serialized chapters along the way. Here\u2019s a quick preview!\nThe Bulwark preview\nThe Bulwark preview\nNext up is \u201cThe Old Man and the Agean Sea\u201d from my good friend and frequent collaborator, writer/artist Jeff McComsey (Honcho; Grendel, Kentucky). Jeff brings an aesthetic to this tale that is somehow both foreboding and warm, and this complete story features some of his best work yet.\nThe Old Man and the Agean Sea preview\nThen we\u2019ve got \u201cThe Night Tanya Tucker Uncancelled Earth\u201d from Jennie Wood (Flutter; A Boy Like Me) and Duane Redhead (2000AD; The Tick), both wonderful, creative people. I\u2019m thrilled that Planet Comics will be the venue for their first collaboration, and this complete story is so wild \u2013 I can\u2019t wait for everyone to see it all! \nThe Night Tanya Tucker Uncancelled Earth preview\nAlso included is an article by Diana Krueger on one of the pioneers of the original Planet Comics: Lily Ren\u00e9e! Diana highlights the life and times of Ren\u00e9e, one of the most prominent female artists from the mid-century run.\nI\u2019ve got a few more (secret!) plans to add some pages to the book if we get past our initial goal!\nREWARDS\nIt's a space ship!\nThe biggest reward for this campaign is, of course, the book. Whether you go in for a physical copy or electronic, I hope you\u2019ll feel that your pledge is well spent on these new sci-fi tales.\nThis first issue comes with two covers: a regular cover with art by Pietro, and a Kickstarter-exclusive variant cover by Matthew Dow Smith! You can order just the regular cover, or both at the same time.  \nPlanet Comics #1 Kickstarter exclusive cover by Matthew Dow Smith\nIn addition, everyone who pledges at the $8 level or above will get a copy of an electronic \u201cmaking of\u201d publication, with a behind-the-scenes look at the creation of this issue. You\u2019ll also get your name printed in a \u201cthank you\u201d section at the end of the book, and you'll get an electronic copy of an original Planet Comics issue from the 1940s!\nThere are a few additional, limited, physical rewards that you can get in this campaign. The first is a neat vinyl sticker of this updated Planet Comics logo, designed by Alan Gallo!\nI\u2019m also offering up prints of Matthew Dow Smith\u2019s variant cover image, sans logos or other text.\nAnd you'll have a chance to get one of the last few copies of Black Terror: Social Insecurity and maybe a few other books I've written!\nThe Black Terror: Social Insecurity\n*Also! The first 30 backers - at any physical level - will receive a signed copy of The Tick 2020 FCBD Special!* \nFree to the first 30 physical backers!\nTHE CAMPAIGN GOAL\nMy first goal with this campaign is to be able to pay the creators a decent rate for their work. After that, I hope to offset some of the printing and shipping costs that otherwise might be prohibitive.\nIf this campaign exceeds its initial goal, all of the extra funds will be funneled directly back into the book, adding pages and helping us get started with issue #2!\nFollow me online!\nIf you\u2019re looking for more content, progress reports or just to see pictures of my dog, you can always follow me online by clicking the images below:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019re currently about 75% finished with the art for this book.

So they strap up, hit the streets and are ready to fight back against bigotry with a sequin baseball bat and some bad ass righteous fury! \nThe fabulous Bi Phallicia\nFollow the most fabulous street gang in the world as they patrol the Gay Village, step up to bigoted politicians and bash down the bashers. And in the midst of it all, they discover there's a conspiracy behind it all!\nThey're sick of being seen as victims! Sick of having crimes against them ignored! The Glitter Vipers are here to fight back!\nThe story is a brisk 60 pages, with a few behind the scenes extras thrown in too to give you a great little package in a glitter grindhouse revenge fantasy!\nThe gang's all here! Art by Katie Fleming\nWho Are the Glitter Vipers?\n Bi Phallicia  - Bi Phallicia, real name Jason Filson, is a Manchester drag queen of some repute, who as well as her weekly shows runs a support group for those that have been victims of abuse, bigotry or hate crimes. Unfortunately, she finds herself becoming not just the organiser but also one of the members. She takes on the lead in the Glitter Vipers gang when they decide to fight back. \nJesus Moretti - Jesus is a Colombian immigrant living in Manchester, UK and close friends with Bi and her group. He's dating Anton Bakunin. He's a broader, tougher looking man who came to the UK to live a more open and free life as a gay man. \nAnton Bakunin - Anton had a rough upbringing, finding it a lot harder to hide who he is as a gay man. An Eastern European immigrant who fled his home where being gay can result in being 'vanished', Anton came to the UK to try and find peace. Unfortunately, homophobia isn't just something that happens 'somewhere else'. \nMelissa 'Mel' Carter - Mel is a garage worker in Manchester, and is dating Bri. They are attendees of the support group after the pair were attacked by homophobes on a tram.  Mel is very tough, and has been harbouring a lot of anger over the surprise attack they suffered, and is eager to make sure nothing like it ever happens again.\n Bryony 'Bri' Stonehouse - Manchester born and bred, Bri has been dating Mel for nearly two years now. She also felt more anger than anything else after they were attacked, but she abhors violence entirely. Instead, Bri uses her smarts and community spirit to build the community support group stronger than ever before. \nCallum 'Cal' Wilkes - Cal came out much later in life, as his life in a biker gang didn't feel like the safest place to be openly gay. In fact, it turned out he was right when he did get outed to his gang and he wound up kicked out and alone. Struggling at first to find his tribe after this rejection, Cal is now a regular of Manchester's leather scene and brings his gruff, take-no-guff attitude to the local queer community. \nQueenie Iwobi - Queenie is a trans woman from a Nigerian family, she moved from her home in London to Manchester for council work years ago. Now, she takes part in the support group as a way of managing the daily micro-aggressions she faces as a proud trans WOC in this world, and to help support others like her. Also not a fan of violence, she joins Bri at the homebase, creating a helpful, safe space for the community and using her skills as a community support worker. \nAlbert 'Alby' Prince - a 16 year old trans masc kid, Alby has been sneaking out to the gay scene for a while to find a safe space to be their authentic self, away from their home where they are not out. Alby became a big fan of Bi's shows, and Bi took them under her wing so she could make sure Alby was having a safe experience. Alby prefers he/him or they/them pronouns, but is not yet out to their family.\nPage of inks by Katie Fleming\nContent Warning\nWe are aware that the topic of hate crimes, bigotry and assault are sensitive topics, that we as a queer community often face far too often. Sensitive to this, the book will contain content warnings so that readers can be aware going in what to expect. \nWe are also aware that it can be annoying to be seen as just the victims all the time. And while there can be a lot of emotions that are discussed after these kind of things, one emotion is often overlooked or swept-under-the-rug: anger. \nPage of inks by Katie Fleming\nSometimes when we see these things happen, or when they happen to us, there can be a strong sense of justified anger, and we look at that through the medium of revenge fantasy grindhouse action and explore what sense of resolution or satisfaction can be found there. \nAll the while telling an entertaining, thoughtful action story in a very modern world. We'll have fun, but won't be making fun. \nWho's It For?\nHave you ever seen the news and just felt so angry? Then you, for sure. \nBut seriously, I think anyone who has felt that kind of strong reaction to things that happen in the world, whether it be a story of injustice they've seen in the news, or an article of a hate-fuelled attack, or worse, have had personal experience with that; I think anyone who relates to that will find something to relate to in Glitter Vipers. \nQueenie Iwobi by Katie Fleming\nAnyone who has stood up to or is aware of organised hate, systemic violence and bigotry in this world can maybe find something in Glitter Vipers that speaks to them. We've all felt angry: this is about our right to that rage, and finding an outlet for it.\nWe all get told that we should not let that anger rise, that we don't have the right to our anger or how lashing out is wrong, but see the same things happen again and again. Glitter Vipers will explore that anger, it's justification and how it too can have a role in recovery, for good or ill.\nGenerally suitable for teens aged 16 years of age or older, the book has some light use of course language, violence, and as mentioned, sensitive topics around bigotry, hate crimes and assault. If you are buying for someone else, please do bare that in mind. \nCover by James Gifford\nWho's Making It?\nOne thing that we wanted to achieve with this book was the keep the whole creative team as queer identifying people. It's an LGBTQIA+ focused story, so it only felt right to have it be made by LGBTQIA+ people. \nThe team is as follows:-\nJoe Glass - Writer\n Joe Glass - Joe is the writer and co-creator of popular LGBTQ+ superhero adventure series, The Pride, now a successful ComiXology Originals series. He's also the writer of Acceptable Losses, a mature, political thriller with a dark edge. Most recently, he's worked with RuPaul's Drag Race star Manila Luzon on a countdown Instagram comic for her single, Robbed! Joe lives in South Wales with his family, and a petulant cat named Oliver. You can find his website here. \nKatie Fleming - Art\n Katie Fleming - Katie Fleming is a queer artist from Dublin, Ireland.  She began creating comics with her Partner with their LGBTQ+ comic '100 Times' and '100 More Times'.  since then she's worked on numerous anthologies and comics, such as 'Heart of Steal', 'The Black Rubric' and the webcomic, 'Ship Wrecked'. Glitter Vipers is her first graphic novel and she's super excited. When she's not making comics she's spending her time as a Werewolf. Her work can be found here. \n Kelly Fitzpatrick - Kelly Fitzpatrick is known for her work on books such as: Bitch Planet, Supergirl: Being Super, Wonder Woman: Tempest Tossed, Shade the Changing Girl, DC: Bombshells, Archie, and Josie and the Pussycats. Nominated for the esteemed Hugo awards, she is also a past nominee for Autostraddle, Ghastly & Prism awards and has worked on titles nominated for the GLAAD and the Harvey awards. Her client list is available on her website and includes such prestigious publishers as DC Comics, Archie Comics & Dark Horse Comics. \nLucas Gattoni - Letters\n Lucas Gattoni - Lucas Gattoni is a seasoned graphic designer and typesetter now pursuing his dream job of comic book lettering. He has lettered GLAAD nominated Liebestrasse for ComiXology Originals, Twin Worlds for Action Lab, Eskimo Kisses for Scout Comics and is currently lettering the Spanish version of Sonic The Hedgehog for IDW. He lives in his home country of Argentina with his husband and their three unnamed goldfish (oops, make that two now). His website is here.\nTed Brandt - Editor\n Ted Brandt - Ted Brandt is best known as an inker, working with his partner Ro on the Eisner- and GLAAD-nominated CROWDED from Image Comics. He likes long walks on the beach, and eating too much pizza. Ted is using his editorial hat on Glitter Vipers to help make the book the best it can be. \nJames Gifford - Cover Artist\n James Gifford - James Gifford is a cis gay illustrator and storyboard artist who lives in London. He's a wayward pirate, plundering whatever illustration jobs he runs ashore on, never resting in one spot for long. A lone creative, a side-spitting gunslinger. The moment you think you have him pinned, he slips through your fingers like smoke. He's earned coin from Cartoon Network and Marvel comics and is currently creating content for Dungeons and Dragons in his spare time. You'll chip your teeth on his tough exterior, but deep down his heart is gold. His website is here. \nSpire Eaton - Spire is a graphic designer, artist, animator and comic creator based in Florida. He designed the Glitter Vipers logo for the book. That fabulousness is all down to him! You can check out his work here.\nHow Far Along Is It?\nAt time of launching the campaign, the book is entirely written, final inks are done for about roughly 20% of the book, with a further dozen pages ahead prepped too, and colours and cover work is starting in conjunction as the rest of the pages are drawn.\nAlby Prince by Katie Fleming\nWe estimate that by the end of the campaign the book will be half way or more complete, and have allowed a roomy space of months between campaign end and delivery in an effort to ensure prompt delivery of the finished product. \nBy following and/or backing the campaign, we will keep you updated with new pages and art as they happen, so you'll be the first to see more as it comes!\n How is the Money Spent?\nA Breakdown of How the Goal Amount is Split\nThe majority of the goal amount is to pay for the art production of Glitter Vipers: this includes the drawing/inking, the colours and the design elements of putting the book together. \nThe next biggest elements are the printing costs (currently based on a modest-to-large print run) and the shipping costs of sending copies out to those who back for physical reward tiers. Costs of shipping have been worked out based on impending Royal Mail price changes taking effect on July 1st 2020. Due to COVID-19 and changes in legislation for USPS in America, international shipping will be rising significantly, but we are baring this in mind in the planned goal amount and postage prices. \nThe smallest element is to go on extra rewards elements, like the stickers. \nAs such, the greatest overall chunk of the the goal amount we are asking for is to cover the production cost and to make sure our art team get a good, speedy payment for their hard work. \nSample colours by Kelly Fitzpatrick\nWhat Can I Get?\nWell, naturally we are looking to provide both digital and print options of the book as reward tiers. In this day and age, there's no excuse to not offer both options to backers, so both will be readily available. \nThere is also a tier to get multiple copies of the book, at a discounted price! This is primarily for comic stores that would like to support and stock the book, but also libraries and heck, if a group of friends all want to support but are on a budget, or you think you know a group of friends or family who'd all be interested in a copy, you can back at that level to get multiple copies at discount. This level is limited.  \nThere are options to get signed copies of the book, signed by writer Joe Glass, but again these are limited due to the time and energy taken in signing a lot of books can take.\nWe also have Glitter Vipers stickers available, so you can grab reward tiers with those included. \nSample of the Embroidered Patch\nOr, why not grab an embroidered Glitter Vipers patch! This is a very limited reward tier, so once it's gone, it's gone. Get it while you can! \nPlus, there's just the positive energy of knowing you've supported a great, queer focused comic project by queer creators, and that's worth everything, right! \nFinally, we have been sure to include the price of postage so when you back, you'll know exactly how much it will be in total. We've based the postage prices on the updated Royal Mail pricing coming into effect on July 1st, 2020, based on the planned sizing of the book and estimated weight.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSometimes life gets in the way, and unforeseen obstacles pop up causing a delay in getting the products shipped in time. In this campaign, we have estimated a lot of time for completion and printing, so all things being equal there shouldn't be a delay to the books going out, but as ever, it is an estimate. \n\nLikewise, as far as postage goes, we have sourced good, strong, tough packaging that should withstand any handling from delivery services. Similarly, we have taken into account the new postal rates for sending to the United States from the UK, and have priced accordingly. This does mean International postage costs are higher, but with the changes in USPS and increases in general post costs due to COVID-19, it is worked out to be as fair and cheap as possible, while still maintaining a relatively speedy and well-handled delivery. \n\nThe biggest challenge is the goal amount: while it can seem large, the goal is what it is to allow for making sure the team are all paid fairly for the books production, the printing of a good sized print run and shipping. The biggest help to overcome this challenge is to share and spread the word of the campaign, so for all of you deciding to support, we hope you can help us in spreading the word too.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Thank You!", "descp": "Our unending thanks for helping us on our fight back!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2020"}], "stat": ["11 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a36 or more", "title": "Digital Copy", "descp": "A digital copy of Glitter Vipers\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Copy", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}], "stat": ["195 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a312 or more", "title": "Print Copy", "descp": "You'll get a print copy of the book and a digital copy too!\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Copy\nPrint Copy", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["165 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a314 or more", "title": "Sticker!", "descp": "At this level, as well as your print and digital copies of Glitter Vipers, you'll be able to mark your membership to the GV gang with a shiny holo-sticker!

All the while, Conrad combats his consuming alcoholism and fading faculties.\nWe're confident that you'll love this book as much as we do. But why take our word for it? \n \u201cBlacking Out is as dark as the smoky California skies that fill its pages. And like smoke, this noir clings to you.

Take the narrative familiars: bad cop seeking redemption, small town with big secrets, people wanting what they can\u2019t have. Toss them in the spin cycle.\u201d - Betsy Willeford\nWhy the oversized hardcover format?\n(Case cover proof direct from the printer. Check out the spot gloss! SoCal foliage in the background not included.)\n\nHaving the privilege to attend the Angoul\u00eame International Comics Festival in France this past decade, writer and co-creator Chip Mosher has not only fallen in love with the oversized European hardcover format (~12.5\" x 9.5\"), but also the creative aesthetic of what the French call bande dessin\u00e9e or BD. Whereas American comics release on a monthly basis and demand tight deadlines, the standard 48 page BD album is drawn over 6 months or longer, allowing the creators to spread their wings and put their best work forward. \n \u201cBlacking Out is a hard drinking, hard boiled mystery with a finale that lands like a ton of bricks\u2014do not miss it.\u201d  - Gerry Duggan, Dead Eyes, Deadpool, Marauders \nWith this approach in mind, co-creator and artist Peter Krause worked on BLACKING OUT over several years, toiling over each page to create a tight 56-page graphic novel. (Note: Chip needed some extra pages, so not keeping it to the standard French 48-page standard is his fault! - Pete.) Working \"Marvel-style\" (the writer providing the artist a script with no panel breakdowns), Peter was able to exercise complete artistic control over the pacing of the story, a rarity in American comics. Chip then followed with a final lettering draft after Peter finished drawing all of the pages. This creative process ensured a deep collaboration between writer and artist... true co-creators in every sense.\n \"Blacking Out is a taut, nasty thriller about people you don't want to know, but will love watching. The slow burn (pun intended) leads to a gut punch that will leave you reeling. Well-done.\u201d -Marc Andreyko, Supergirl, Manhunter, Torso \nEd Dukeshire then lettered the project with Scalped alumnus Giulia Brusco providing colors. Finally, Tom Muller designed the logo and the cover, working directly with Peter. In the spirit of the project, each contributor was guaranteed as much time needed to provide their best work.\nIn total, the team spent more than three full years creating this graphic novel. No expense was spared, no shortcuts were taken. This graphic novel was crafted without compromise; an unrushed, immaculately sculpted book with few peers. \n( Letterer Ed Dukeshire crafted hand-drawn, custom balloons and manipulated fonts for word mood and emphasis.)\n \u201cHardcore characters in search for what they can\u2019t name on a road they shouldn\u2019t travel. A gut punch of crime fiction by Mosher and Krause.\u201d -Gary Phillips, The Be-Bop Barbarians \n(Giulia Brusco's amazing color work on one of Chip and Peter's favorite pages.)\n \"A rural crime tale with more twists and turns than a backcountry road.\u201d - Ed Brisson, Sheltered, Old Man Logan \n(Tom Muller's distressed logo for the graphic novel.)\n \u201cThe writing is sharp like a razor, the sort of sharp that you don\u2019t feel when it cuts you. It\u2019s only when you see the blood begin to pool that you realize that you\u2019re reading a really good book.\u201d - Shannon Wheeler, Too Much Coffee Man, The New Yorker \nDigital Rewards\nWith the book completed, a PDF of BLACKING OUT will be immediately available to those who backed tiers including a digital copy of the book; all backers who receive any digital reward will immediately be able to read BLACKING OUT as soon as the Kickstarter is funded and complete.\n(Cover for PDF version of BLACKING OUT ready to send to backers once the Kickstarter ends.)\nThere are two additional digital items available: the Blacking Out Photo Reference PDF and a PDF of Chip's previous graphic novel, Left On Mission, co-created and drawn by Francesco Francavilla.\nWhile writing BLACKING OUT, Chip Mosher took numerous pictures to serve as inspiration for the book. Traveling around Southern California, Chip took pictures of active forest fires in and outside Los Angeles and he then created collages of places that he imagined would serve as the setting for BLACKING OUT. This PDF served as inspiration for the art and coloring of the final work.\n(Photo collage by Chip Mosher for inspiration in the making of BLACKING OUT.)\nAs a special bonus, Chip Mosher\u2019s previous graphic novel with co-creator Francesco Francavilla, Left On Mission \u2014which debuted in 2008, and is currently OOP \u2014 is included digitally within certain most tiers. Left On Mission recently reverted to co-creators Chip and Francesco, who are excited to get this critically acclaimed, but little seen, work in the hands of more people. \n(Title page for LEFT ON MISSION co-created by Chip Mosher & Francesco Francavilla. Colors by Martin Thomas. Letters by Marshall Dillon.)\nChip and Peter wish to thank Francesco for letting them include Left On Mission as part of this Kickstarter.\nThe Lobby Cards\nThe BLACKING OUT Kickstarter allows Chip and Peter to celebrate the traditions of film noir by offering 12 cinematic lobby cards from today's most acclaimed artists, with a special card drawn by Peter himself. Lobby cards are miniature movie posters used to promote films in the lobbies of theaters in Hollywood's golden era. Noir films historically offered some of the most vivid imagery of the medium, inspiring this reward tier. Chip and Peter reached out to some of today's greatest comic artists to provide their interpretations of scenes within BLACKING OUT. These artists include:\n Francesco Francavilla (Afterlife with Archie), Eduardo Risso (Moonshine), Mirka Andolfo (Mercy), Dan Panosian (Slots), Emma R\u00edos (Pretty Deadly), Jacob Phillips (That Texas Blood), Patric Reynolds (The Mask), Ryan Kelly (Saucer Country), Jamal Igle (The Wrong Earth), Elise McCall (Spy Island) and Peter Krause. \n Our lobby cards will be a smidge smaller than the book (~12.5\" x 9.5\").\nUPDATE: Since hitting $29K we've added an additional card by Peter Krause, inspired by Robert Fawcett. See below.\n(Lobby Card by Francesco Francavilla)\n(Lobby Card by Eduardo Risso)\n(Lobby Card by Jamal Igle.

And unlike many kickstarters who are self-publishing, this book has already found a publisher: Floating World. They have agreed to publish, distribute, and market the book, however, there's one hitch. Comics is hard. And drawing a four issue mini-series is a full time job. Unfortunately, Floating World isn't in a position to pay advance page rates at this time. So, we need your help. Dave and Alexis are chomping at the bit to make this bizarre cyberpunk comic. However, we need to raise enough money to make Alexis' page rate. \nThat's where you come in. \nSynopsis: \nIn Gran Caracas the only way to get ahead in life is to become a police officer. You want to live in one of the state-controlled high-rises? Become a cop. Want to own property? Become a cop. Want to run for public office? Become a cop. \n In the year 2131, Venezuela is a post-apocalyptic military state, governed by a ruling class of brutal elite and their enforcers: the police force. We follow childhood best friends, and ostensibly adoptive brothers, Julian and Ezekiel as they attempt to navigate the seedy underbelly of this cyberpunk dystopia.\nThe boys have been raised as street urchins by Julian\u2019s father, Juan, who refuses to enlist and become an officer. They scavenge trash and steal, endlessly attempting to squeeze something from nothing. Gran Caracas is plagued by corruption and greed. This hits our characters the hardest when, during a routine police drug raid, a riot breaks out destroying their make-shift home.\nTheir lives will never be the same. Julian is almost killed in the riot. Juan takes his son's body to a trans-humanist doctor and pleads with him to give his boy a cyborg body. The doctor agrees, however there's a catch. The planned obsolesce of many of his vital organs means he's perpetually trapped in an upgrade-or-die indentured servitude existence.\n In order to make enough money to support himself and his now-largely-cyborg father, Julian enlists in the police force where he's convinced he'll be able to make enough money to leave Gran Caracas. \nObviously that never happened. Julian worked his way up through the force and was eventually recruited into Gran Caraca's newest cyborg paramilitary division Project: Night Hunters. They've been tasked with cleaning up the gangs who are trafficking Yopo through Venezuela. After a shootout, Julian discovers that the leader of the gang is none other than... Ezekiel. \nFrom this point on, Julian and Ezekiel live parallel lives. Julian enlists in the police force, both to make enough money to finance both his and his father\u2019s cyborg implants, and to, in his mind, stop this cycle from happening again to someone else. Ezekiel, however, ends up falling in with the fiercely anti-cyborg gangs who run Gran Caracas\u2019 underbelly by trafficking in Yopo. He works his way up through the hierarchy until he becomes one of the main bosses\n\nSample Pages: \nNight Hunters Cover by Alexis Ziritt and Vanesa Del Rey\nBy backing this kickstarter you'll be able to enable us to make this crazy book that most other publishers were to scared to publish. Anti-authoritarian genre stories about the real effect of living in a police state? That sounds... risky, right? Floating World believes in taking chances and publishing interesting works from creators who are pushing the boundaries of what comics can be. And this book checks all those boxes. \nBy helping us reach our goal you'll be insuring that a completely unique and idiosyncratic work is produced with zero compromise.  \nBudget:\n$20,000 raised\n$3000 - 10% fees\n$17,000 - $xx page rate paid to Alexis for 94 pages of comics\nPatch:\nNight Hunters Patch\n Enamel Pin:\nNight Hunters Pin\nAnd Action figures:\nSombra aka Julien from Night Hunters\nSombra aka Julien (Standard and Stealth Variant)\n\nSombra aka Julien (standard)\nSombra aka Julien (Stealth Variant)\nExamples of commissions by Alexis Ziritt: \n\nOther books we're offering:\nAction hospital is kind of like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind meets Men in Black set in a hospital. It's about grief, trauma, and existential despair... as well as laser swords, anthropomorphic shark people, and super-intelligent talking vegetables. \n There are three volumes, each around three hundred pages. \nAction Hospital Volume 1:\nAction Hospital: The Future Is A Strange Place\n Action Hospital Volume 2:\nAction Hospital: Half-Light Bleeds\n And Action Hospital Volume 3:\nAction Hospital: No More Walls\nCreatives:\nDave Baker - Writer,  Originally from the drug-infested wasteland that is Arizona, Dave Baker writes and draws things. He's written everything from infomercials to feature films. He writes the comic books Fuck Off Squad, Action Hospital, Suicide Forest, and Professor Cuties.\nAlexis Ziritt - Illustrator of such projects as Space Rider, Tarantula, and many more. \nVanesa Del Rey - co-cover illustrator, she began her career doing concept art for animation. Her work in comics has been described as dark, gritty and mysterious with great dominance of figurative work. She has illustrated Scarlet Witch, Spider-Women Alpha, and Daredevil Annual (2016) for Marvel Comics.\nRobert Negrete - letterer, illustrator in his own right. Robert has worked on such comics as Action Hospital, Brickleberry, Captain Omega, and Scions of War.

In the past you helped me print a mess of these Thumb Books for a lot of cartoonists, designers, students... and, well I ran out of them.  Thusly I'm here to do it again!\nWHERE IT ALL STARTED:\nLike most cartoonists and comic artists, I did my thumbnails on loose paper and I would inevitably lose them in the sea of paper in my studio. My initial solution was an improvised thumbnail template stapled together. I\u2019ve been refining Thumb Book over the years and this will be the third official printing.\nSPECS:\nThe THUMB BOOK is 4\u201dx 5.5\u201dand is currently 60 pages.  \n-Designed to be a pocket sized sketch book with a template on each page that corresponds to the layout of a standard comic page. Originally created to help me keep all my preliminary work in one spot, I also like them because I can grab a script, pencil, Thumb Book and hit a coffee shop if I need a change of scenery.\nWHAT'S NEW:\nSEQUENTIAL ART TEACHERS:\nIn addition to working in comics, I am also an adjunct at Pennsylvania College of Art and Design. In this coming Fall semester I\u2019ll be teaching a Sequential Art class and I want to incorporate these sketchbooks into the curriculum. If this campaign is successful, I\u2019ll be providing all 20 students with THUMB BOOKS.\n-If you teach a sequential art/comics based art class and think these books could be helpful for your students, please shoot me a message.\nPics from my original Thumb Book design before incorporating the grid.\nHOW I USE THEM:\nOnce I have a script in hand I do small breakdowns four up on the Thumb Book page. After that each breakdown gets taken to a full (Thumb Book) page layout. I try and make those thumbnails as tight as possible. I then scan those thumbnails and enlarge them to begin the penciling stage.\nBREAKDOWNS\nOnce I have a script in hand I do small breakdowns four up on the Thumb Book page. Here I'm mostly focusing on leaving enough room for lettering and making sure speaking order is reflected in layout.\nTHUMBNAILS\nAfter that each breakdown gets taken to a full (Thumb Book) page layout. I try and make those thumbnails as tight as possible. I then scan those thumbnails and enlarge them to begin the penciling stage.\nSCANS\nOnce I scan in my thumbs and make a spread out of them, I'll share them with editorial or any other creative partners on the project. This also let's me look at stories as a whole and see if I'm repeating a layout too much.\nThere are more than a few steps between these two, but I like to figure everything out compositionally in my Thumb Book before hand.\nREWARDS:\nIn addition to offering the Thumb Books I'm cracking open my original art vault for rewards. Original art reward backers will receive THREE pages of original 11x17 original art. I'll be pulling from SMEDLEY, HONCHO, SON OF HITLER, FLUTTER and a few other shorts.\nI'll also be offering a limited Post-It note commissions!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nVery excited to see who outside of comics connects with the Thumb Books and what uses they might them to.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "3 THUMB BOOKS", "descp": "THREE 60 page THUMB BOOK sketch book.

I enjoyed the story and the characters so much that I decided to create a whole book about them. And so was born Social Insecurity, continuing the story of these (mostly) forgotten superheroes as they near the age of 100.\nIf the name \"Black Terror\" sounds familiar, it's because he was first published in the January, 1941 issue of Exciting Comics from Nedor Comics; for a time, he was a very popular character, but like many of his contemporaries, the Black Terror soon faded into obscurity (and the public domain) after the end of World War II. Other companies, like Eclipse, Image and Dynamite have since published this character in one form or another, often trying to reinterpret him in modern ways.\nThis book, though, follows the Black Terror as if he had aged in real time since his 1941 debut! No longer an active superhero, The Black Terror and his fellow heroes face old age as they each near their own personal centennials. Accompanying our title character are other public domain heroes such as the Silver Streak, the Fighting Yank, the Mentalist from Mars and Mr. Q!\nSmall press publishing can be both time consuming as well as expensive, so I'm here on Kickstarter asking for your help to push us all across the finish line with our book. In addition to the book itself, we're offering some great rewards, which I'll detail below, along with links, previews and a look at our creative team!\nThanks for checking us out! If you enjoy superheroes, comedy, and stories about really old people, I hope you'll pledge and help us reach our goal!\nTHE BOOK:\nSocial Insecurity will run at least 90 pages long - longer if some stretch goals are met! It collects the \"Wednesday at the Diner\" short story with Rafer Roberts, and it includes a brand new, full-length story with artist Ryan Howe. There'll also be several pinups by different creators and \"making of\" material to round out the volume, all with a brand new cover from Rafer Roberts.\n Click the image below to read the original \"Wednesday at the Diner\" short story: \nClick the image below to read a preview of the full-length \"Social Insecurity\" story:\n THE REWARDS:\nHopefully, the biggest reward for this campaign is, well, the book itself. But we've also put together some really neat extras, too!\nThe pin: a 1.5\" soft enamel pin with featuring the classic Black Terror, with art by Dani G.!\nThe stickers: a set of two grumpy superheroes on 4x6 vinyl stickers, with art by Mark Welser!\nThe print: an 8x11 art print on sturdy stock, with art by Duane Redhead!\nThe bookplate: get a personalized bookplate for the inside of your book, signed by the creators of the book and with an original sketch (of your favorite Golden Age hero) by Ryan Howe!\nBe in the book: get drawn into the book as a character by artist Ryan Howe! If you choose this option, we'll be in contact to get reference photos.\nStretch goals: I've got a few stretch goals planned in case we exceed the original $3000 goal. First and foremost, I'll make the book longer by adding new stories and other material! More info on these to come!\nTHE CREATORS:\nTHE CAMPAIGN GOAL:\nMy first goal with this campaign is to be able to pay the artists on the book a decent page rate so they can, you know, eat and stuff. After that, I hope to offset some of the printing and shipping costs that otherwise might be prohibitive.\nIf this campaign ends up exceeding the $3,000 goal, all of the extra funds will be funneled directly back into the book, adding pages and stories to bulk up and add value to the comic!\nFollow me online!\nIf you're looking for more content, progress reports and to keep up, you can always follow me online by clicking the images below:\nThanks for looking!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're currently about 50% finished with the art for this book.

My name is CW Cooke and I've been working in independent comics since 2007. I've worked with companies like Big Dog Ink (Joan of Arc), Image Comics (Spread short story), Devil's Due (hit series Solitary with a soon to be released second volume which began as a Kickstarter), Action Lab (Stillwater), Pilot Studios (Always Punch Nazis vol 1 and more to come), Arcana, Viper, and Bluewater as well as in the self-published realm of comics.\nMy first series, Solitary (which many of you helped fund a few years back), has recently entered a development deal for film and television. Here's a link to see more about that and follow that progress as it happens: \nhttps://graphicpolicy.com/2018/10/04/nycc-2018-devils-due-comics-and-cw-cookes-solitary-gets-a-development-deal/\nCo-created with artist Travis Hymel and with colors by Jeremy Kahn and letters and logo by Micah Myers, we're working hard to bring our newest idea, L.U.C.H.A., to life. And Agente needs your help! \nA HORROR WRESTLING EXTRAVAGANZA:\nL.U.C.H.A. is the story of Agente, a luchador detective who spends his life solving low level crimes and murders, taking on any job that falls in his lap. He just so happens to get wrapped up in a murder campaign that involves vampires, wrestlers, and other notorious figures before the rug gets pulled out from under  him...and the readers!\nL.U.C.H.A. is one of the most fun things I've worked on in comics. Born from a simple idea as part of the Kayfabe anthology (a wrestling comic anthology put together by comic creators and wrestling fans alike, with the emphasis on wrestling as real), this story about Agente took on a life of its own because of the incredible working chemistry Travis and I had and the unbelievably insane story we came up with. The first ten pages will rock your socks off and after that it will swerve and take your breath away.\nPin, available at $50 level\nI've wanted to make a comic that was this insane for a long time, and I've found the perfect partners in crime. And we need your help because this beautiful work will require a lot to deliver the goods.\nBy pledging you're helping us see the series through to issue four. We're keeping our rewards focused around issue one, to keep this campaign simple, but we'll be sure to update you whenever new issues are available as well, and try to come up with some extra perks down the line to remember the backers who helped make this book's launch possible.\nWe have a lot of plans for stretch goals, but before we get there, hit that pledge button please! The rewards are at the bottom of this page.   \n WRITER: CW Cooke\nARTIST: Travis Hymel\nCOLORS: Jeremy Kahn\nLETTERS/LOGO: Micah Myers\nEDITS: Shawn Gabborin and Shawn Pryor\nSPECIAL THANKS: Jay Huwer, Shawn Pryor, Jeremy Mohler, Kit Caoagas, Shawn Gabborin, Trevor Mueller, Steve Ekstrom, my wife, my wonderful friends, my team, and so many others that I'm probably forgetting that helped keep my mind at ease as I built this thing. \nREWARDS:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe first issue is completely drawn and in the process of being colored.

One of the first of mankind to discover his super powers, Dynamo for years used his uncanny super strength to save lives and change the world. Dynamo was one of the first of the super powers to join, and the SFC, as it was called, became a house hold name for wrestling entertainment and with it Dynamo\u2019s fame and legacy grew... However, it all seemed unreal for Dynamo. And underneath all of the bravado, Dynamo, the strongest man in the world, felt as if none of his life was actually his, that somehow it has all been meant for someone else, and that somehow, I\u2019m some cruel way, he was living a lie...  \nYears have gone by, and with the waning of time, countless heroes and villains have fought, inside the ring and outside. Now, as Dynamo has tired and nears time for retirement from the squared circle, he begins to have strange feelings and then visions of another life and of an unspeakable action that makes him question who he really is and has been for years. Dynamo is a story about what it truly means to be the world\u2019s strongest man and the fight it takes to accept who you truly are.\nI was excited when asked to write this series for Dynamo. I love everything that Marcel Dupree and Evoluzione Publishing is doing. They are fighting the good fight. I also loved that Dynamo is part of the SFC Universe, a world that is very diverse and full of interesting, dynamic characters.\nAs excited as I was to write Dynamo, I did have one hesitation. Pop culture is filled with white male protagonists. That\u2019s always been the case. I grew up surrounded by them from Luke Skywalker to Indiana Jones. As a kid, I saw so many movies and read so many books where the protagonist was a white male, and the director / writer was also a white male. That\u2019s how I learned to see the world \u2013 through the lens of a white male. With Dynamo, I wanted to do something different, something that sets him apart from the usual white male protagonist. \nThat\u2019s when I started thinking, what if Dynamo becomes woke and realizes that everything he is, all the success he\u2019s had, came at the expense of someone else. Not just anyone else, though. It came at the expense of an African American wrestler.\nThis opened the door to write about racism, patriarchy, and white privilege at a time when our country so desperately needs to have this discussion and confront our own racism and white privilege once and for all. Suddenly, I had to write this series. Dynamo was a story that needed to be told. \nYour support will allow us to tell it.

If we hit $8,000 I will add in a few of my favorites.

If we manage to get this far I will be able to extend the book with comics written and drawn by guest creators that expand and flesh out The Creators universe!

This power, fueled by adolescent emotion, is simultaneously awesome and extraordinarily dangerous as Creators are only limited by their imaginations. The series follows a group of young creators and their fantastic creations as they try an carve out their place in a world that hates and fears them. \nIn 2016 I successfully kickstarted The Creators, Volume 1: Imagination Is Power which began the story of Maya and her creation, Kardunn as they were brought to the Creator Academy under the nefarious headmistress, Morgan Etain.\nNow, two years later, I am back with the conclusion of this story arch and am proud to bring you The Creators, Volume 2: Strength in Unity which will complete the story arch I began 6 years ago!\n The $5000 I am trying to raise with this campaign will be used to fund the printing of the full color, print edition of Volume 2 of The Creators. It will include chapters 7 through 12 of the comic - over 200 pages - that I have been working on for the last few years. I have put together a few really exciting rewards for you to help me get to this goal\u2026\nstretch goals\nAnything raised over the $5000 will be put towards some exciting stretch goals that will improve the print quality or extend and add content to the book\nSTRETCH GOAL #1: $6500: COVER UPGRADE + SPECIAL PINUP! If we can hit this first stretch goal I am going to upgrade the covers to have spot UV and make them all extra special! We got to do this for volume 1 and it really made the cover something special! In addition I will take my 5 year old daughter's drawing of Mr HugZ and color it in the style of The Creators and add it as a pinup in the back of the book.\n(left) Amelia's Drawing of Mr HugZ - (center and right) Cover and Spot UV location (PINK)\n STRETCH GOAL #2 - $8000: SKETCHBOOK AND PINUPS. Over the years I have gotten to work with some incredible artists and some of them did some incredible pinups inspired by the creators universe.  If we hit $8,000 I will add in a few of my favorites.  On top of that I will compile all of my favorite sketches from the production of volume 2 and create a sketchbook section for the book.\nHere are Pinups by Nick Difabbio (L), Erin Laue (C), and Jamie Noguchi (R)\nSTRETCH GOAL #3 - $10,000: Guest Comics!  If we manage to get this far I will be able to extend the book with comics written and drawn by guest creators that expand and flesh out The Creators universe!  These take place in times and scenarios well outside what is covered in my narrative within the book so it gives a good global sense to the book.\nSAMPLE PAGES\nSample spread from chapter 8\nSample spread from chapter 9\nSample spread from chapter 10\n Thank you all for taking a look at The Creators.

This live parody of professional wrestling asks artists to dress up as weird and amazing characters and draw funny responses to topics given to them by our famous WHEEL OF DEATH! Topics like: Kitty Twister, Giants with Baby Arms, Babe Lincoln, and Cute Animals on Fire. Hey\u2026weird. Kind of like the title of this game! At the end of every match a winner is chosen by the audience by applause, hollers, screams. We have been putting this crazy show on for a decade and finally found a way to turn it into a game that you can take home and play without involving any of us, effectively making the live\u2026show\u2026useless.   \nTHE GAME\nIt\u2019s simple really. You get a deck of cards, filled with carefully chosen topics from Super Art Fight\u2019s WHEEL OF DEATH! You also get a REF card and some directions. To start: \nAssign someone to be the ref and put the REF card in front of them. Then have them turn over the first topic card and read it aloud. \n Set a timer for 2 minutes on your phone to give everyone time to draw. Now I know what your thinking\u2026You can\u2019t draw. Well that doesn\u2019t really matter! Use stick figures, label the drawing, hell, write something down if that is the only way you know how to communicate. Just come up with some sort of funny, clever, or unexpected response to the topic. \nAt the end of 2 minutes, everyone stops and takes turns presenting their drawing to the ref. The ref then chooses the winning drawing based on ANY CRITERIA THEY CHOOSE (so y\u2019know, pander to them) and then it\u2019s on to round two. \n Just pass the REF CARD clockwise and go again. \nBUT WAIT! There\u2019s a twist! Some of the cards are COMBO cards. If one of these cards comes up, grab someone else\u2019s drawing from a previous round and draw on that. You can change, cover or do anything you want to make this old drawing fit with the new topic. \nThe game ends\u2026well, whenever the hell you want. I mean, it\u2019s a party game. We\u2019re all winners here.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nIf we are lucky enough to pass our $2,000 goal then we want to make it worth your while to really push us over the edge so here are some stretch goals to really get you excited...\nIf we hit $4,000 - We will expand the deck with 8 new topics with 8 new illustrations, extending the fun for all!\nIf we hit $6,000 - We will design, print, and include stickers for EVERY backer who chooses a physical reward.  These will include a Super Art Fight Logo sticker and a few character stickers from our roster.\nIf we hit $8,000 - well...let's just go bigger...AGAIN!

Well into your eyeballs anyway as this campaign is for a DIGITAL VERSION. What we're really trying to do here is get this beauty colored and that's where you come in. I'm hoping to raise $1560 to cover Marissa's fantastic color work on the next chapter, The Ballad of the Two Headed Dog #3, and also cover a very, very small print run.  \nShould we exceed our goal and hit our $2800 stretch goal everyone who donates $5 or more gets a PDF of BALLAD OF THE TWO HEADED DOG #4 for free!  So while that entry price of $5 may seem steep for a 28 page comic (it really isn't if you look at what some publisher's are charging for digital), if we hit our stretch goal you'll end up getting two comics for that $5. Math fans have already figured out that means you'd only be paying $2.50 each!\nSo if this is a story you want more of please consider supporting Phil, Marissa, and myself as we near the ending of our unique little tale of keys, sleep walkers, and bird headed people. \nSo what is DEADHORSE? \nDeadhorse is a comic book about a man with nothing who finds the key to everything. It is witten by me (Eric Grissom), drawn by Phil Sloan, and colored by Marissa Louise and David Halvorson. Phil and I started this comic way back in 2010 and it was the first comic I had ever written. Critics have been very kind to us and people seem to dig this weird world we've created. The first book and the first chapter of Ballad of the Two Headed Dog was colored by David Halvorson. With the release of our last issue, Ballad of the Two Headed Dog #2, Marissa Louise took over as colorist.\nThe story revolves around a reclusive man named William Pike who comes into possession of a strange key and finds himself the target of an evil industrialist. When William learns the key may solve the mystery behind his father's death, he embarks on a journey into the farthest reaches of Alaska in search of the truth. It's a strange little tale that is part comedy, part adventure, part mystery. I'm very proud of the work and I think if you give it a chance you'll dig it too.\nSTRETCH GOAL!\nIf we can fund the project, you'll receive a PDF of Ballad #3. If we hit our stretch goal you'll receive Ballad #4 as well.\nThe rewards are digital\nI wanted to keep the cost of this campaign as low as we could which is why you'll see only digital rewards with the exception of the print tier.  That reward level will be super limited so if you need to have a print copy get on that right away. I may or may not ever print it again as a single issue so be sure to jump on that right away if you need it in your life.  Phil and I will both sign them.\nDeadhorse Cover Gallery. Art by Phil Sloan.\nWe will be sending everyone PDF files as well as using ComiXology to fulfill the digital version of Ballad #3 and potentially all of the other digital titles as well.\nBut what if you want to read the older DEADHORSE in print? Order it here!\nWho is making this thing?\nArt/Covers by Phil Sloan\nPhil is an artist who has done work for IDW's War Of The Undead and Weird NJ.

Through the perspective of a young person of color trying to join a new and intriguing community, It addresses cycles of violence recurring throughout American history since Congress\u2019 abolishment of slavery in 1865. The work is influenced by Chris Law's upbringing as a black man during hip hop's explosion in the 1990s and it features an innovative blend of modern dance and hip hop movement. The piece evolved as Chris and Ama Law both became frustrated with the volume of police brutality being reported in the news. \n   Full Circle allows audiences to explore issues that are affecting American citizens. It is our intent that this production empowers both the youth and adults in our community to feel welcome to share their views regarding our heavy social and political climate. We are encouraging dialogue that will lead to a better future.\nPhoto: C. Stanley\n   The concert is performed in the round to pay homage to hip hop's practice of the \"cypher\". The cypher is a performance circle in which there is an exchange between and among performers and observers. Performers have a responsibility to jump in and dialogue through dance, spoken word and other expressions of artistic ability. Full Circle invites you into the cypher, building a community where we not only have fun, but stay present for the harsh realities as well.\nPhoto: C. Stanley\n   We feel it is important to present at Dance Place because it lives in a diverse neighborhood where it has supported the Brookland/Edgewood area and it's surrounding community since 1986. Even as the city continues to grow, thrive and build new establishments, Dance Place has continued to reinvigorate itself, maintaining a mission to support the youth in the community through dance education and youth programing. It will be very inspirational and important to put art in front of young audiences and bridge this discussion between generations.\nPhoto: C.

Years after their breakup, the two continue to battle about spiritualism, the belief that the living can communicate with the dead. Doyle, creator of the great detective Sherlock Holmes, believes in ghosts, mediums, even photos of fairies. Houdini spends his time debunking the seances and the frauds who run them. The two are at war, two ideological armies whose battle of words is about to become a battle to the death for the very fate of humankind.\nHoudini \u2014 with his wife Bess and an entourage that includes bodyguards, operatives, agents provocateur and the creepy, aspiring writer HP Lovecraft \u2014 heads off in pursuit of Doyle in search of answers after an attempt on his life by Spiritualists is ascribed to the man of letters. \nSir Arthur and his wife Jean, in league with crooked medium Margery Crandon, demonologist Damascus Boring and infamous occult madman Aleister Crowley, are busy racing to hasten a coming invasion of the dead by opening the \"Gates of Hell\" that hold the veil between our world and the next.\nAs Houdini tries to stop Doyle from ushering in a spiritual and literal apocalypse, The Death Defying becomes a battle of wills, words, faith, science, fisticuffs, handguns and magic that stretches from the windswept menace of Stull, Kansas to the small apocalypse of Tungaska, Russia. Beliefs will be tested, lives will be threatened and the scariest specter of all is whether or not any of this is real.\nThis Kickstarter is to fund production and printing of The Death Defying #1, the first in a series of four 30-page issues. It's an historical occult adventure and it's only made possible via this Kickstarter campaign.\nThe First Six Pages\n          The Rewards\nThe Death Defying #1! Available as either print or digital. Over 30 pages of comics plus backmatter including essay from Terry Tyson, mentalist and magician.\nThe Variant Cover! Available only as a print reward, the variant cover provided by Tyler Crook, artist of Petrograd, Harrow County, Bad Blood and cover artist for The Dark and Bloody. Some examples of how good he is--\n Enamel Pins! Exclusive set of 3 spooooky pins including the Spirit Altar, the Spirit Box and the Crystal Ball. Pick one or buy all 3.\nT-Shirts! It's a t-shirt.

Impress your friends by being drawn into the first issue and waving it around as you brag \"Hey, that's me in this comic which takes place in 1925. Now you have to admit I'm cool.\" They will have no choice but to admit that you are, in fact, very cool.\nCommission! A 9 x 12 commission by series artist Gavin Guidry for you.

We're making this book because we believe in it and we think people will like it.\nThe Money\nWe are looking to raise $8,000 minimum to pay artist Gavin Guidry, colorist Marissa Louise & letterer Micah Meyers for their work on the book. At this minimum amount, they are working at reduced rates and I am writing and running/fulfilling the campaign for free.\nThere are no unnecessary costs in the mix, this is the absolute cheapest we can make this issue while still paying everyone a proper rate for their work. Here is how the money breaks down, percentage wise:\nWhy one issue & not the whole thing at once?\nTwo reasons: 1) The team is assembled and eager to work and it's hard to get a team together and have momentum, so we'd like to follow that momentum and get started right now rather than wait a few months. 2) I don't want to get crushed on taxes. I already owe taxes on the Short Order Crooks campaign and adding the amount that this book would cost for all 4 issues would throw my already confusing finances into deeper peril. We'll be back in January to fund the remaining 3 issues in a single campaign. \nStretch Goals\nAny extra money raised will go towards paying contributors full page rates and possibly a page rate for myself. Once that level is exceeded, money will be rolled forward to production costs for Issue #2.\nBut if you go nuts and get us past 10K, we'll think of something special to do for you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll of us are experienced in our respective fields in comics. We've hit deadlines for all kinds of publishers on all sorts of timetables and we've worked on personal projects with similar swiftness and focus. We know what we're doing.

Our goal is to complete production on the issue before the end of the year and have books sent out to backers before the end of January.\n\nThis is my third Kickstarter and I do my best to be fully transparent as far as where money goes and how it is spent, down to the nickel. So far I have delivered 3 out of the 5 issues of SHORT ORDER CROOKS and we are on schedule to finish and deliver the entirety of the book before the end of the year, 6 months from when the book was funded.\n\nThis being comics and life being life, a delay or two might possibly pop up, but updates and explanations will be quickly provided via Kickstarter as to any changes in delivery dates of issues and/or rewards.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "The Assist", "descp": "You're helping!

Check out what, with your help, we can add to the entire book!\nThe 4th Monkey is a comic book anthology featuring stories to raise awareness about environmental and social issues. Brought to life by 20+ comic book creators, each team will be creating a story about something that is near and dear to their hearts... or just something that's been bothering them. The 100 page book will feature 8 short stories revolving around the following topics: Online Bullying. Poaching. Political Polarization. Mental Abuse. Ocean Pollution. Pesticides. Alcoholism. Suicide.\nThere are A LOT of problems in the world, and we can\u2019t possibly tackle them all. The 4th Monkey is our attempt to do something about the ones pulled right out of the hearts of the contributing creators. Sure, you may feel stronger about some than you do others, but the quickest way to someone\u2019s heart is through story. So, if you finish this book with even the slightest thirst for more knowledge, or were simply entertained, then I like to think that we did our job.\nMyself and Co-Creator/Writer, Daniel Farrand, have personally funded much of the artwork you'll see on this page in order to bring you the best possible preview to the anthology and to show how dedicated we are to making this book a reality. With this Kickstarter we're looking to fund the completion of the artwork and a print run in order to get the book into the hands of backers and fellow creators.\nCover Art by Jose Johann Jaro - Logo by Kenneth Matthews\n \nBut... The 4th Monkey? What does that even mean?\nPlaying on the 3 Mystic Monkeys proverb, \u201cSee No Evil - Hear No Evil - Speak No Evil\u201d, The 4th Monkey is one who is not blinded. It is aware and wants the world to take notice, before it's too late.\n***The \"yes, we know all primates aren't monkeys\" disclaimer***\nWhen the 3 Wise Monkeys proverb originated, there was no distinction between apes and monkeys - hence much of the past (and current) artwork done as chimps. Scroll down further - we even have gorillas!\nWe need to all come together... right now... over this Abbey Road inspired pin-up by Salomon Farias!\n \nTHE STORIES!\nDue to the heavy subject matter of some of the stories, the tones range from serious, to sad, and even funny. There's action, drama, hijinks, and even super heroes. We're hoping that every story locks you in and takes you for a completely different ride from the next.\n\nNow, without further ado, here's a 1 page preview from each of the current stories featured in The 4th Monkey. Every story is lettered by the great and powerul HDE.\n'Dark Waters' - Ocean Pollution. (W) James E. Roche (A) Hus Ozkan\n (Video trailer for Dark Waters)\nPLAY\n\n   'Painted Prey' - Poaching.

We are also open to any ideas you might have for extras we could include. Just send an email to stealingfirecomics@gmail.com.\nThis Project  \nWe are collecting the first four chapters of Dream Crasher into a single printed 130+ page Volume One. After successfully Kickstarting the print edition of Chapter 1 in March 2016, we went on to self-funded small print runs of Chapters 2 & 3. We will be digitally releasing Chapter 4 with this Kickstarter and later on comiXology. With Chapter 4, our story completes the first of three major arcs. In addition we are including the digital edition of Chapter 5 with every reward tier, which will be released this coming winter.\nDream Crasher is a story about survival and creating a new world from the ashes of the old. It was also inspired by a very real experience of grief. Beneath its dystopian exterior, Dream Crasher is about finding the last bit of light in a world that's gone dark and protecting it with every fiber of our being. Even when the powers that be are stacked against us. Even when the cause seems hopeless.\nDream Crasher Volume One [Not Final Cover]\nThe Story\nFollowing a bizarre cataclysmic event, a group of children struggle to survive in the world filled with angry ghosts, beasts made from human parts, and interdimensional parasites.\nExcerpt from #4: Dearest, the Shadows\nOur story opens with Amalie: a girl who lives alone with a strange beast she calls Creature. She doesn't know what Creature is or where he came from, but she knows that he has her Papa's eyes. The two have been working together since The Long Winter started, but everything changes one day when Creature brings home something that Amalie hasn't seen in a long time: a living human boy.\nExcerpt from #1: Creature's Keeper\nPraise for Dream Crasher:\n\"Like a nightmare dipped in a candy shell\"\n- Ben Beaury, GeeksOUT\n\u201cDream Crasher is a truly unique piece of art.\u201d\n- Comicbooked.com\n\u201cThe start of a fascinating new horror series.\u201d\n- PlayNicePlayNow (PN2)\n\u201cWhen it comes down to the action sequences\u2026 there\u2019s truly no bounds to Olsen\u2019s work.\u201d\n- For the Love of Indie\nExcerpt from #2: The Land Vomits Ghosts\nPrimary Rewards\nPrimary Reward Tiers\n*Signed Copies are price higher primarily due to the fact that Daniel and Reed live on opposite sides of the country (Brooklyn and Seattle, respectively).

It took years of careful planning and perseverance to complete the first chapter, which was published digitally in June 2015. Despite numerous personal and creative setbacks along the way, we have created something we are incredibly proud of. We have been sharing our story with the world one convention at a time. This next step will allow us to enter the graphic novel market while we continue publishing 2 chapters a year until we're finished.\nReed and Dan at Saratoga Comic Con\nIn My Own Words: Daniel\nIn the summer of 2011, Reed and I were on track for releasing Chapter 1 in early 2012. The first chapter was drawn and painted and the second chapter had been started. We still hadn\u2019t thought about lettering, logos, or print budgets - but we had momentum. Then everything came to a screeching halt when my boyfriend died.  \nThe unexpected trauma, the weight of the grief, and the subsequent depression and healing all took their toll in various ways. It was more than 6 months before I was able to return to the project again, and it would be another year before I finished the next chapter. This was in no small part because I gained a whole new perspective on what I was making happen to Amalie.   I was following Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s sixth rule to a T. I was being a sadist and making awful things happen to my main character, but I hadn\u2019t given a second thought to how it was affecting her. I hadn\u2019t thought about how she processed the world around her, or who she was because of it. Through my own grief, I understood her on a whole new level. In many ways, Amalie is a representation of how strong I wish I could be. She\u2019s a survivor, but she makes it look easier than I know it to be.\nDan working on the Chapter 1 Lettering\n While Dream Crasher is a bleak dystopian tale on it's surface, I began to think of this new world less like a graveyard and more like fertile soil. It\u2019s not a story about the world that\u2019s been destroyed. It\u2019s about the new world taking root in its place. It\u2019s about the children who have an opportunity to shape it. Beyond the horror of the present, there is hope. There is a future worth fighting for.  \nUltimately Reed and I made the decision to completely redo the artwork for Chapter 1. It set us even further back, but I can confidently say that we have a better comic because of it. Reed\u2019s patience, understanding, and empathy throughout this project has been instrumental in my sticking with it. There were plenty of opportunities to give up quietly and walk away, and yet we stuck with it. I can\u2019t thank him enough for that. We\u2019re still pushing on, and I believe now more than ever we will see it through to the end.  \nExcerpt from #4: Dearest, the Shadows\nIn My Own Words: Reed  The Dream Crasher story, and Chapter 1 in particular for me, personally represent that relentless monastic fortitude that I have continuously needed to be happy and achieve what I have so far in my life. It is about recognizing the excuses for not drawing after a long day of biking to work and packing CSA boxes with your best friend, but knowing that an excuse does not ink a page, and that I can always sleep later. I hope you enjoy what we have here, it is just the tip of one colossal nightmarish iceberg.\nReed working on the Chapter 1 Prototype\n Our Budget\nGoal: $4500\nThis will cover a full print run of 500 copies plus the production costs of making the book (lettering the fourth chapter,* book design, copyediting, and commissioning original art) and shipping rewards to our backers.\n*Lettering costs for Chapter 1-3 were covered by our first Kickstarter.\nCreature tours the New York City subway.\nStretch Goal: $7000\nThis will allow us to double our print run (1000 copies) as well as include a free Dream Crasher bookmark with every physical reward.\nWe will unveil further stretch goals upon making this one, but the possibilities include: funding the production of Volume 2, original sketch cards for backers $35 and higher, Stealing Fire t-shirts, and even a hardcover edition. We may even ask you (backers and potential backers) what you would most like to see. But in the meantime we'll try not to get too far ahead of ourselves.\nExcerpt from #3 Welcome Home\nPosters & Original Prints\nKeep in mind some available as both posters and original paintings, some are available as only one or the other.\nCreature's Keeper\n--Poster - $55 Tier\n--Original Piece - $100 Tier\nCreature's Keeper\nThe Land Vomits Ghosts\n--Poster - $55 Tier\n --Original Piece - $100 Tier\nThe Land Vomits Ghosts\nThe Dreamer's Parasite\n--Poster - $55 Tier\n--Original Piece - $100 Tier\nThe Dreamer's Parasite\nDearest the Shadows\n--Poster Only - $55 Tier\nDearest, the Shadows\nWelcome Home \n--Original Artwork Only - $100 Tier\nWelcome Home\nVolume One\n--Original Artwork Only - $100 Tier\nVolume One - Original Painting\nCreature in a Red Dress\n--Canvas Painting (by the author) - $100\nCreature in a Red Dress\nSigned Original Proofs\nChapter 2 - Original Proof Copy.\nDistinguishing characteristics: Internal pages darker than final copies, missing Keness logo on the back.\nChapter 2: The Land Vomits Ghosts\nChapter 3 - Original Proof Copy.

If you dig it, he's releasing while we are running this campaign. You check out more of his music on soundcloud.\nStealing Fire Comics\nStealing Fire Comics\nStealing Fire is a name derived from the myth of Prometheus and his act of bringing fire to humankind. It is a metaphor for taking what is needed but not given; for challenging the power dynamics of our present and envisioning new ways forward. It's about eating from the tree of knowledge even though it is forbidden; accepting that banishment from paradise is more honorable than ignorance. We're writing with pictures and drawing with words to rattle the cage of a complacent world.\nThe imprint Stealing Fire Comics was created to launch Dream Crasher in 2015. It was always intended to be a vehicle for multiple creative endeavors, and 2018 will be a year for such things. The first of these was Soulless Golem (Stealing Fire #1), which is available now in our gumroad store. \nExcerpt from Soulless Golem\nSouless Golem is the first of an annual zine series (Stealing Fire #1, if you will). The Soulless Golem drawings began after white supremacist Richard Spencer gave a speech likening non white humans to soulless golems. Drawing on Judaic mysticism and witchcraft, as means of us collectively conjuring a force (golem in this case) to fight back against oppression. The drawings are in direct respond to the Trump administration and the rise of hate as mainstream.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our second Kickstarter. All of the artwork has been completed for the story. All that's left to be done is the book design itself, which we already have scheduled.\n\nWe are doing a print run of 500 (1000 if we hit our stretch goal). By doing a small print run we are able to work within a more reasonable budget, but run the risk of the full amount being a bit small after rewards are distributed.\n\nWe are also shipping heavier books this year. We have less rewards than last time, so the process should be a lot simpler after we send the surveys out. Getting everything packaged and weather proofed while being economical can be a challenge in itself, but we are prepared and already have most of the materials.\n\nAlthough the book is longer, the parts are almost the same as our last Kickstarter, and we were successful. There are stil plenty of challenges, but we have a road map and past experience to guide us.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Digital #1 + New Zine", "descp": "NEW - For just $1 we will send you a digital copy of our first chapter, plus a pdf of a new zine featuring 2 short comics by Daniel & Reed.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2017"}], "stat": ["3 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 4 or more", "title": "Digital 1 & 2", "descp": "A digital download of Chapter 1 (33 pages) and Chapter 2 (25 pages).

The inhabitants of distant planets and moons are finally free to roam the stars again. Only one destination location in the galaxy still stands...\nWelcome to THE STRIP!\nTHE STRIP is a futuristic travel mag, full of speculative stories of \u201cThe Vegas that Was or Could Be!\u201d Intergalactic travelers flock to the ruins of the once-great VEGAS to learn about the ancient culture that lived there, and each story is a special stop on the tour that re-imagines the original city of sin. The tour guides \u201ceducated guesses\u201d are a real hoot, and each story is a flashback or historical re-enactment. Part drunk history, part whacked out re-interpretation to please the alien rocket-set.\nTHE STRIP, A Twisted Vegas Anthology, will be a collection of 100+ pages of weird and warped comics, inspired by the original city of sin, Las Vegas! It is the sixth entry in the Red Stylo Presents anthology series.\nLast year, we hit the jackpot with the Harvey Award-nominated The 27 Club. As a follow-up, we\u2019re letting it ride with The Strip! Strange tales from Las Vegas are the theme, in the form of 8-page comics.  Creators were asked to draw inspiration from the music, mob, casinos, luck\u2013whatever visions Vegas conjured for them!\n#VegasTwisted\nOnce betting closed, we emerged with eleven short stories that painted a wonderfully warped vision of Las Vegas.  The pieces inspired us to turn THE STRIP into a trippy travelogue filled with \"What ifs?\" and \"WTFs?!\"  Stops along the way include stages where magic is more than an illusion, a slightly off-kilter vision of the future, and the deserts around Vegas where something hungry lurks.  The book will be a full-color trade paperback and deluxe digital package. Even tourists from off-planet are flocking to our casinos, so we hope you'll join us on this strange ride!\n  James McGee, editor/heart-throb behind The Strip\nThe Strip marks James McGee's first time behind the editor's desk for the Red Stylo Presents anthology series.  James joined Red Stylo as the writer of \"Star Crossed\" in the Shakespeare Shaken anthology.  He went on to stage a hostile takeover under the guise of  the evil \"Snidley McGee.\" These days, his alter egos are kinder and gentler, but still snappy dressers. His work has also appeared in Unfashioned Creatures, The 27 Club, This Mutant Life and Fireside Fiction.  James lives in West Virginia with his wife, Laura, and an ever-growing army of cats.\nTHE STRIP includes stories from:\nScott Bachman and Matthew Sparks\nDavid Booher, Pedro Mendes, and Sara King\nDino Caruso and Jan Velasquez\nMoll Green and Alex Clark\nMike Hall and Declan Fitz\nMartin Hayes, Michael Ellis, and Bram Meehan\nSherezada Kent and Y.C.

Watch this video to learn about the importance of preserving diaries, the focus of the Museum\u2019s first-ever Kickstarter campaign. \nWe\u2019re thrilled by the response to this Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for cataloging and digitizing over 200 Holocaust diaries and translating and transcribing three of them. \nAfter reaching our $250,000 goal we\u2019re excited to announce a new stretch goal: An additional $50,000 to translate and transcribe 10 more diaries. Back this project today to help Save Their Stories!\nPLAY\n\nThis is no ordinary map.\nUS Holocaust Memorial Collection, gift of the family of Joseph Strip\nIt\u2019s a deeply personal illustration of one family\u2019s harrowing escape and survival during the Holocaust. It\u2019s included in a diary\u2014one of over 200 diaries the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has in its collections waiting to be cataloged, translated and published online.  \nWe\u2019re in a race against time to do this specialized, expensive and time-consuming work, and we urgently need your help.  \nWe know first-person accounts are powerful. Most people are familiar with the diary of Anne Frank, and her personal account is often the first introduction that many have to the devastating history of the Holocaust. But it\u2019s not the only diary of its kind.  \nEach of the diaries in our collection has an important story to tell, of suffering and strength, persecution and perseverance. Written by people young and old, from diverse backgrounds and countries, they bring to life a broad spectrum of individuals\u2019 experiences during the Holocaust. Now, in the face of growing Holocaust denial, we must bring more stories to light before we lose the firsthand memories of survivors and witnesses who can shed light on the context of these diaries and other priceless artifacts in the Museum\u2019s collection.  \nAs the survivor generation passes, it is our responsibility to make sure their voices live on so that their experiences will not be forgotten. You can be a part of preserving history: Back this project and Save Their Stories.\nFor this project, we'll catalog, preserve, and make available online over 200 Holocaust diaries in the Museum\u2019s collection -- for the first time ever. The handwritten pages and notes are in 17 different languages and will need to be transcribed and translated into English. While we would love to raise enough funds to complete the translation of every diary, reaching our project goal will enable us to translate into English three diaries written by Jewish refugees who fled their homes to escape the Holocaust:  \nThe diary of Joseph Strip, a young boy who wrote about his family\u2019s harrowing experience over the grid-lined pages of his math notebook. \nThe papers of Lucien Dreyfus, a journalist and schoolteacher from Strasbourg, France, who was deported to Auschwitz in 1943. His collection includes letters to his daughter, son-in-law, and granddaughter who escaped to the United States in 1942.\nThe diary of Hans Vogel, who fled Paris with his family while his father was interned, which contains hand-drawn and colored maps of their journey. \nEach of these three diaries will be published in its entirety online so that people everywhere can view the original pages and read the translations. Like Anne Frank\u2019s personal record, these stories expose the truth of Holocaust history -- so that ever more researchers, authors, teachers, students can learn from them and help fulfill the promise of Never Again. \nHere is our estimated timeline for this project:  \nSummer/Fall 2018: Cataloging complete for all 200+ diaries \nWinter 2018: Digitization complete for all 200+ diaries \nSpring 2019: Collections for all 200+ diaries published online at ushmm.org  \nSummer 2019: Translations and transcriptions for 3 feature diaries added to ushmm.org collections listings\nThe Museum has collected millions of pages of historic documents containing details on the individual experiences of Holocaust victims and survivors. Although we are committed to making our entire collection available online, the sheer size of it makes this a lengthy, expensive project. \nEach additional first-person account or piece of evidence made available on the Museum\u2019s website--which is visited by millions of people every year--has the potential to reveal a new aspect of Holocaust history or highlight its relevance to the world today.\nThese three are just some of the many accounts we hope to bring to the public:  \nJoseph Strip (formerly \u201cStripounsky\u201d)\nUS Holocaust Memorial Museum Collection, gift of the family of Joseph Strip\nJoseph Stripounsky awoke early on the morning of May 10, 1940, to the sounds of aircraft and gunfire. The Germans had invaded his town of Antwerp, Belgium. He was just 17.  \nJoseph fled with his parents and younger brother, leaving almost everything they owned behind. He carried with him a math textbook and two math notebooks, one of which became his diary.  \nThey joined thousands of others heading south through France, making a slow and arduous journey with very little food or money. In France, they spent a year trying to get farther away from the ever-encroaching Nazis. They managed to secure American visas through Joseph\u2019s father\u2019s employer and finally landed in New York in May 1941\u2014just six weeks before Joseph\u2019s 18th birthday, when he would have been legally required to stay in France.  \nJoseph tells the story of his family\u2019s harrowing exodus through everyday details and extraordinary sketches.\nLucien Dreyfus\nUS Holocaust Memorial Museum, Gift of Monique Allen\nLucien Dreyfus was a dedicated journalist and professor of modern languages in Strasbourg, France. In 1940, anti-Jewish legislation was passed in France, and he was dismissed from his teaching position because of his faith. \nAs persecution against Jews intensified, he fled his town and sought safety in southern France. Refuge did not last long. In October 1943, he and his wife were arrested and just one month later, they were deported to Auschwitz and murdered. \nLucien had kept a diary since 1925, but his writing became more frequent during World War II, recording the realities of day-to-day life, the experiences of his students, and what he knew about Jewish persecution in other parts of Europe. \nHis diaries also contain deeply personal messages he wrote to his daughter, son-in-law, and granddaughter who were able to escape France in 1942 and eventually made it to the United States. Lucien knew he might never see them again, but continued to write with the hope that they would receive his diaries. Miraculously, they did years later. \nHans Vogel\nUS Holocaust Memorial Museum Collection, gift of Eva Vogel\nAt the age of seven, Hans Yakov Vogel fled Germany with his parents and elder brother in 1936, settling in Paris where they remained until the outbreak of war. His father was separated from the family and interned by the French as an enemy alien at Lisieux, and later at Gurs in the south of France. In May 1940, just 24 hours before the invading German forces reached Paris, the rest of the Vogel family fled south. They traveled among a stream of other refugees, mostly by foot, as the Luftwaffe shot machine guns at them.  \nThrough the help of friends, the Vogels were reunited and settled in Oloron-Sainte-Marie in the unoccupied zone near the Spanish border. They remained there from June 1940 until April 1941, when they received papers from the United States Consulate allowing them to immigrate. They arrived in New York via Lisbon on the steamer Nyassa in August 1941. Two years later, Hans Vogel died at the age of 16 from an illness.  \nHans kept an extraordinary diary of their flight, including photos and hand-drawn and colored maps tracing the family's journey from Germany through France and eventual immigration to the United States.\nYour pledge doesn\u2019t just get you access to behind-the-scenes updates on the work (and often the discoveries made) during the process of cataloging, translating, and publishing these stories.

USHMM is unable to recognize your gift unless the informational survey is completed.  \nPlease allow an additional 4\u20136 weeks for your reward to ship internationally. Note: we are not responsible for international custom fees.  \nSome of the rewards are experiences (tours, events, lectures) offered at a specific time and place. USHMM is not responsible for any backer\u2019s travel or costs to participate in such experiences. Further, if a cause beyond USHMM\u2019s control requires rescheduling or cancellation of an experience, USHMM is not responsible for any additional travel or costs a backer may incur in order to participate at the new time. USHMM cannot guarantee that experiences occurring on dates yet to be announced, or that must be rescheduled, will occur on a date that is convenient for all backers.  \nA living memorial to the Holocaust, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum is located on the National Mall in Washington, DC, and inspires citizens and leaders worldwide to confront hatred, prevent genocide, and promote human dignity.  \nSince its dedication in 1993, the Museum has welcomed more than 41 million visitors, including 99 heads of state and more than ten million school-age children. Its website, the world\u2019s leading online authority on the Holocaust, is available in 16 languages and was visited in 2016 by more than 19 million people.  \nAll photos unless otherwise noted: US Holocaust Memorial Museum", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nChallenges: No matter the outcome of this Kickstarter project, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum will remain committed to its mission of rescuing Holocaust evidence, confronting hatred, and preventing genocide.\n\nAnd, the Museum will continue to work to find funding for Save Their Stories\u2014but the more than 200 diaries featured in this project will not be made accessible until the financing is secured. Without Kickstarter funding, there is no immediate date for being able to do this work and bring these first-person testimonies to light for students, teachers, scholars, and those wanting to learn more about the Holocaust and preserve the memory of its victims and survivors.\n\nRisks concerning rewards: As always with manufacturing a product, it\u2019s possible to come across production delays. We are confident that with successful funding, the Museum will be able to deliver our tangible and experiential rewards within the times stated for each. However, our rewards that feature live events are subject to change, given availability and circumstances outside of our control.\n\nShould any changes be made to availability of rewards and events, the Museum will communicate these to backers as soon as possible.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Thank You Starter Pack", "descp": "Every gift helps!

This book details its effects on my life, my loves and my career. It\u2019s the most personal story I\u2019ve ever told but I hope that many of you will be able to relate to it. I\u2019m hoping it helps you because making it has helped me. It has given me a brand new perspective on my illness.\nIt\u2019s not a subject of shame. It\u2019s a symbol of strength.\nWe don\u2019t have to let anxiety drown us. We can float.\nFloat is told from the perspective of three characters which act as symbolic stand ins for my personality. Their tales all converge with a confrontation of the glass ceiling overhead.\n In its discussion of anxiety, this graphic memoir also reinterprets the glass ceiling. While the term is generally associated with women and minorities in their careers, it easily applies to those who deal with mental illness in their profession, and the stigma it carries. In the book, I have illustrated the ceiling as a physical threat.\nWe are now unlocking some amazing stretch goals on our way to the Float hardcover edition!\n    I am excited to present this book to the public, as it is a departure from my previous work and a personal testimony of mental illness. I am an award-winning graduate of Pratt Institute and a freelance illustrator. My first graphic novel, Mr. Scootles, was published in 2008 by Alterna Comics. In April of 2009, my series Tara Normal launched as a popular weekly webcomic. It was awarded the 2009 WRCA Reader\u2019s Choice Award for Best New Comic and appeared in TAPS Paramagazine, the official publication of the show Ghost Hunters on SyFy. I won the 2016 Spacie Award for Best Independent Comic Artist. In addition to illustration work for clients such as CBS Radio, T-Mobile, and two holiday themed pieces for the official Walking Dead website, I have also illustrated stories in the comic book collections Nightmare World, Tales of Mr. Rhee and Love Stories (To Die For) written by Dirk Manning and published by Devil's Due Entertainment. \nDuring this exciting new art project, I\u2019ve collaborated with my friend, musician Victor Guest. Victor is a brilliant artist and working with him to expand the dimensions and scope of this project has been a dream come true. He\u2019s creating a soundtrack to accompany this book. It will allow readers to experience Float in a unique way.\nAs part of this art project, my wife Shelley has created YourGlassCeiling.com. The website gives people the chance to really see into my life and how it's shaped this project. We're even giving people the chance to share their personal experiences on the Breakthrough Moments section of the site.\nYou can also view full pages of artwork from Float at this link: http://yourglassceiling.com/category/making-of/the-art-of-floating/\nWith your help, Float will become a unique visual and audio artistic presentation. \nAll of our rewards are Kickstarter exclusives and will not be available anywhere else. We have set up multiple rounds of stretch goals so that if we raise the necessary money Float will become a Kickstarter exclusive prestige format hardcover edition just for Float backers! We have to unlock all of them to achieve this ultimate goal.\nHere are some of the great rewards we are offering. \n               ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs I'm writing this, the artwork for Float is 90% completed so any risk is minimal.

On the wrong side of 40 after turfing out of the military, he\u2019s drifted from town to town and a series of dead-end kitchen jobs and quasi-legal freelance work. But his longtime dream of owning his own restaurant has finally come true, back in his hometown of Portland. Rock should be happier than ever, but the reality of his dream has a nasty habit of dragging him down. His customers are uncultured savages, he's not making enough money to pay back his loan sharks and they\u2019re forcing him to do something morally iffy or they'll take his truck. And possibly his thumbs. \n Harper Marbury isn\u2019t exactly a thief. She works half a dozen side hustles to pay her rent at the Split Apple Co-Op Loft where she shares overcrowded floorspace with dozens of spare changers, young families, traveling musicians, burnouts and scam artists. Developing a love of cooking by throwing the random ingredients found in the Co-Op\u2019s fridge every day together to feed her roommates, Harper\u2019s been nurturing a dream of what she could do in a real kitchen, with real ingredients. When she breaks into Rock\u2019s truck, mostly it\u2019s to get out of the rain, but when he doesn\u2019t show up, she opens up for business. Just to try it out. Just to see what it's like to cook in a real kitchen, with real ingredients.\nWhen Rock busts Harper, he hires her on instead of kicking her to the curb, inducting her into the arcane rituals of food cart society, a land where every cart collective is a gang vying for territory and rivalries are resolved with food truck duels rolling down the middle of Hawthorne with baseball bats. While Harper learns the ropes, Rock begins his job for the Bardems, searching for the identity of a rogue food truck operator who\u2019s invading the Bardem\u2019s territories. Together with Harper, as his conscience and helping hand, they\u2019ll navigate a world of secret menus, food pirates, culinary femme fatales, curmudgeonly dads, shadowy figures, creeps, foodies and 5 star ratings, trying to uncover the secret before the Bardems burn Rock\u2019s world down.\nSHORT ORDER CROOKS is a 5-issue, full-color comic that\u2019s equal parts comedy, crime story and cooking comic. The first issue is due out in June 2017.  We have future arcs we would like to do to tell the complete story, but we need your help to fund this first arc and help us find an audience for our weird little book.\nThe Creators \nEisner-nominated writer Christopher Sebela (High Crimes, Heartthrob, Injustice Ground Zero, We(l)come Back, I Live in A Clown Motel) \nArtist George Kambadais (Grave Lilies, The Double Life of Miranda Turner) \nColorist Lesley Atlansky (Kid Sherlock, Team Spirit, Baroque Pop Anthology, High Crimes)\nShort Order Crooks was initially created with Kelly Sue DeConnick (Bitch Planet, Pretty Deadly) back in 2010. After many years of other work getting in the way, Kelly Sue giving me her blessing to carry on without her and publishers reacting in mild confusion at the pitch, it is a comic that can only happen if we do it ourselves. We're asking for your support. Which is where Kickstarter comes in...\nThe Kickstarter\nAll money raised will go towards paying artist George Kambadais and colorist Lesley Atlansky's page rates for all five issues (120 pages) of SHORT ORDER CROOKS and to give backers some unique rewards. Since this is 100% creator-owned, there's no publisher's financing propping us up. The 15 pages we've done so far have been made on faith and spare time. Our Kickstarter goal is the bare minimum needed to bridge the gap that allows George and Lesley to be paid enough to commit to working on pages full time and to get copies of all five issues in the hands of readers. If you've liked any of our previous work or you support indie, creator-owned books or if you're looking for a comic that is a little off the normal path, we have a book (and some rewards) for you.\nThe Rewards\nDIGITAL COPIES\n- We'll send you a link to pdf/cbr files of each issue as we complete them.\nPRINT COPIES- The print issues of SHORT ORDER CROOKS will only be available during this campaign as part of a Kickstarter-based print run. All copies will be signed by writer Christopher Sebela and numbered and mailed out upon completion of the issue.\nTHE SECRET MENU\n- A digital pdf/cbr with almost 100 pages of behind-the-scenes process and artwork of issue #1. The Secret Menu will include the full script, as well as George\u2019s inks and Lesley\u2019s colors without lettering. Concept and sketch art, the original series pitch, character descriptions, a digital copy of issue 1 with notes and commentary and more. Almost all this material is exclusive to the Secret Menu. Perfect for completists or anyone interested in digging deeper into the comics creative process.\nVARIANT COVERS- Each issue will be released with a variant, with cover art provided by a different artist every month. Our amazing roster of artists includes Claire Roe, Brian Level, Jonathan Brandon Sawyer, Robert Wilson IV and Chris Visions. These variants will never be made available again except as possible bonus material in whatever collected edition we come up with.\nBOOKMARKS\n- Cardstock, nice as heck, perfect for a large comic or a cookbook.\nSHORT ORDER COOKS PRINT\n- A two sided cardstock print, 6x9, by series artist and co-creator George Kambadais. Sometimes you're a Rock, sometimes you're a Harper.\nENAMEL PINS\n- Everyone loves them, you want them, we're going to make them. These pins are still being fine-tuned, but they will look like this. Except smaller:\nRETAILER PACKS\n- For retailers only. 3 or 5 issue packs of Issue #1 or all 5 issues, with a retailer-exclusive cover. We'll thank your store in the back of the book.\nPAINTINGS OF YOUR FAVORITE FOOD\nArtist Kelly Williams will paint your favorite food in watercolors, 9x12. Your food will look like this:\nSHIRTS\n- 2 kinds to choose from, the Rock-o's Taco's shirt by George Kambadais or the Short Order Crooks logo by designer Dylan Todd.\nDUMBSTRONAUT SPECIAL\n- Get signed print copies of the runaway smash zines I LIVED IN A CLOWN MOTEL and POOL DISASTER. Or get them as digital copies, expanded with new content not available in the print versions, as well as the Kickstarter prose book I LIVE IN A CLOWN MOTEL.\nFULL DUMBSTRONAUT- Sign up for the Full Dumbstronaut package and get the Clown Motel and Pool Disaster zines, the Clown Motel prose book and be among the first to get a pdf/cbr copy of my upcoming zine COFFEESHOP. DOG.\nCOMICS\n- Get signed copies of books by writer Christopher Sebela such as Heartthrob, We(l)come Back v1 & 2, Demonic, Dead Letters, High Crimes or Injustice Ground Zero. Can be personalized for future gift giving.\nCAMEO\n- Your likeness will be used for one of the many people who populate the Crooksiverse. Will try to get you a line if I can, but no guarantees.\nART COMMISSIONS\n- Series artist and co-creator George Kambadais will draw a commission for you and only for you. Make your friends jealous.\nSCRIPT CONSULTATIONS\n- Series writer and co-creator Christopher Sebela will work with you on a script or pitch of your choosing. Will provide notes, suggestions, have skype calls if you want to talk things out more directly. No OGN scripts. Don't have a script to go over now? Don't worry, this reward doesn't expire.\nTHE BIG NIGHT\n- Get all 5 issues, regular and variants, the bookmark, the enamel pin, the print, the Secret Menu digital insider, a shirt and get thanked in the book.\nTHE IDIOT'S SPECIAL\n- Since my last Kickstarter was about the Clown Motel and people keep bringing it up, I'm offering this as a rare chance to be an idiot and have the king idiot at your side. I will stay in your room or we can go separate. No weirdos. No murderers.\nIF YOU WANT TO BUNDLE SOMETHING WITH ANOTHER REWARD LEVEL, PLEASE MESSAGE US AND WE WILL MAKE IT HAPPEN.\nSOME FINE PRINT\nDue to ordering requirements possibly leaving us with leftover stock, that stock will be sold after the campaign with preference given to retailers and then backers, all profits made going back into the book.\nPrint versions of Issue 1 will go out within a month of the campaign's completion, while we await the money to reach us and begin making orders. The remaining 4 issues will be coming out every 4-5 weeks with an eye towards completion around October or November of 2017. Updates will be provided on Kickstarter on a regular (no less than monthly) basis. \nThe Money\nWe are looking to raise $16,000 minimum to pay artist George Kambadais and colorist Lesley Atlansky for their work on the book. At this minimum we raise, they are working at reduced rates and I am writing and lettering the book for zero money. If we can reach our stretch goal of $24,000, everyone will get paid their full page rate. \nThere are no unnecessary costs in the mix, this is the absolute cheapest we can make a 5-issue comic series for while still paying everyone a proper rate for their work. Here is how the money breaks down. It's pretty simple.\n  The Stretch Goals\nStretch goals are where campaigns get into trouble. We're doing our best to avoid that by not promising anything crazy. To be completely transparent, we would love to go above the goal not so we can get gold edges on our pages or embed holograms into the pdfs, but so that both George and Lesley can be paid their full working rates and I, hopefully, can be paid some compensation for writing, lettering and running the campaign. So we're trying to make this fun, but also not something that we actually have to pay a ton of money to make happen. In that spirit...\n$18,000 - George, Lesley and I will record a director's commentary for all five issues, where we talk over each other and maybe bring up an interesting factoid every now and then. Listen to us slowly get tired of each other since we all spend most of our time working quietly by ourselves. Everyone who has given at the $5 and up levels will get mp3s of this to listen to as you read along. George and Lesley will get paid more.\n$20,000 - Everyone who gives at the $5 and up level will receive a pdf book of recipes from famous comic book creators. Eat like the stars! George and Lesley will get paid more. I will get a small payment.\n$22,000 - An illustrator will be hired to fancy up the comic creator's cookbook.George and Lesley will get their complete page rates. I will get a little more money.\n$24,000 - Wow, we totally don't have to worry about anything at this point. Thank you. That's very nice of you. We will hug you at a con. The entire creative team will be properly compensated for their time, which hardly ever happens.\nFuture Stretch Goals\nAny money raised beyond the 24k stretch goal will go strictly to paying the creators and put towards production of the 2nd arc of SHORT ORDER CROOKS. Rewards at this level and above will mostly be digital, perhaps with some slightly nicer paper stock for the print issues.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll three of us are experienced in our respective fields in comics. We've hit deadlines for all kinds of publishers on time and we've worked on personal projects with similar swiftness and focus. We know what we're doing. We've got everything set on our end.

This will be a limited print exclusively for the kickstarter. Thanks to Chris Lewis Lee for the beautiful illustration.\nGalahad and the Far-Off Horizon is a 130 page collection of five stories, set in a fantastical world of witches, golems, and magical creatures. I've had the pleasure of working with some of my favorite artists over the past two years in bringing these stories to fruition, and - with your help - we'll be all set to take this anthology to print.\nI owe many thanks to Chan Chau, Julian Adkins, John Adkins, Maria Frantz, Julie Godwin and Devin Kraft for helping make this project a reality. Their hard work and dedication can be seen in every single page of this book. Each of them brings a unique art style to the book, and it's fascinating to see their different interpretations of the character designs. I have linked their names to their previous work, so you can have and idea of what to expect in the anthology.\nBelow is a small preview of what they've created for Galahad and the Far-Off Horizon. As our campaign progresses, we will showcase each artist and what they've brought to the project.\n   The beautiful wrap-around cover was painted by Julian Adkins, and Emily Osborne designed the vibrant endpapers. \n    The Garden of Galahad is a story about love and dedication. Galahad, an enchanted suit of armor, carries out the wishes of its master until the young witch Brynne interrupts its peaceful routine. Over hills, by seasides and past the ruins of old castles, the pair embark on the journey of a lifetime. Julian Adkins beautifully illustrates these pages with flatting assists by John Adkins. This story is 49 pages long and introduces the world in which all the following stories are set. Click here for a preview of the first ten pages.\n   The four short stories, illustrated by Chan, Devin, Maria, and Julie, explore the backgrounds of key characters before The Garden of Galahad and help flesh out the world they live in. \nThe Witches Laugh (8 pages) introduces us to a powerful coven.\nBroken Keep (14 pages) looks back at the early life of Galahad's creator, Lance.\nTougher Than The Hills (26 pages) uncovers a mistake Brynne made in her youth.\nWhen Magic Was Free (14 pages) details the tragic beginning of the series antagonist.\nAlong with the five stories that comprise the anthology, there are companion illustrations and a character gallery featuring artwork from some amazing folks. I'll be posting a few of these as the campaign rolls on. \nDigital and printed versions of Galahad and the Far-Off Horizon, as well as several different digital bundles are available now. \nThere's also some extra goodies to choose from - postcards and posters - if you'd like even more of Galahad and the Far-Off Horizon in your life.\nThe wonderful Meredith McClaren has donated 20 hardcover copies of Hinges Book 1: Clockwork City. This is beautiful book collects the first chapter of Meredith's webcomic and each copy is signed and sketched.Grab one while you can! We are so very greatful for Meredith's donation and her support of our project.\nAs a thank you for your support in this project I am making two mini comics I've written, Adventures in Nate's Perilous Challenge illustrated by Jack Gross and Mother Made us to Die illustrated by Marek Jarocki available to all physical backers at $5 for the pair. You can click through on the titles and see a preview. Just add $5 to your pledge with a physical reward and both of these comics are yours!\nWe also have two original art tiers from Christa Dippel and Kristeen Parmeter and one digital commission from Julian Adkins, so be quick to jump on those if you're interested. These are available for international shipping as soon as the campaign launches.  \n  As you can see, most of the Kickstarter funds will be dedicated to printing, with a couple thousand going to Kickstarter fees and shipping out rewards. We are not relying on funding to pay the artists; they have been compensated prior to the campaign. However, if the Kickstarter is funded beyond all of the stretch goals (i.e. past $20,000), a portion of the excess funds will be divided among the creators.\n   Thank you so much for reading all the way through this. I appreciate your support and I cannot wait to have these print copies in my hand and in the mail to you.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe art for this book is almost complete. By the end of the campaign, all pages will be ready to hand over to the printer. We will post updates throughout the Kickstarter.\n\nThis fundraiser is strictly to pay for a print run, and the shipping to get these books out to you fine people. If we do go above our goal, there are a few stretch goals in mind, outlined above.\n\nThere's always the risk of printing errors and delays, but I will keep everyone posted on a regular basis.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Digital Collection One", "descp": "Digital collection of the anthology.\nINCLUDES:\nGalahad and the Far-Off Horizon PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}], "stat": ["59 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Digital Collection Two", "descp": "Digital copies of the Anthology and the Making of The Garden of Galahad.\nINCLUDES:\nGalahad and the Far-Off Horizon PDF\nMaking of The Garden of Galahad PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}], "stat": ["27 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Print Edition One", "descp": "Printed softcover trade sent to you anywhere in the US.

Thank you for your support!\nWe started our journey with the purpose of offering a better pet food \u2013 one that\u2019s nutritious and also reflects our ethical values as animal lovers.\nIt\u2019s easy to forget where the food in our pets\u2019 bowls comes from, and we believe the humane treatment of animals should extend to those that make up your pet\u2019s diet.\nEach Purpose Dog Food formula is made of real, locally sourced ingredients. It's a healthy diet based on what dogs eat in the wild. \nPurpose Treats for Dogs & Cats contain just one ingredient: a free-range or grass-fed protein sourced from American family farm. \nAt Purpose, we believe you shouldn\u2019t have to worry about what\u2019s in your pet\u2019s bowl or how the ingredients got there. \n  Purpose is 100% committed to providing the highest quality and healthiest freeze-dried dog food products and treats for dogs and cats. \n  Freeze-drying is an innovative process that locks in the nutritional value, taste, color and freshness of each ingredient, allowing your pet to enjoy the same great taste as regular raw food without safety issues.\nBecause the process removes moisture, it doesn't have to be kept frozen. Very convenient!\n  PLAY\n\n  Our food and treats are passionately prepared using humanely raised and human-grade, antibiotic-free and steroid-free meats, poultry, organic produce, minerals and vitamins in a human-grade food production facility.\nThere is no denying it! Feeding solely freeze-dried food to pets over 40 lb. can be expensive. That's why we suggest using our products as a topper or mixer with kibble if your dog is over 40 lb. This will dramatically increase the nutrition of the meal. \nPurpose Dog Food and Purpose Treats for Dogs & Cats are manufactured under the supervision of a USDA inspector who oversees and matches package claims.\nWe source vegetables, fruit and meats from suppliers who have passed an extensive vendor program required by the USDA and our manufacturing kitchen is USDA inspected and approved.\nWith Purpose, you are not only feeding your dog or cat top quality pet food and treats but you are are also supporting humane farm animal practices and American family farms. \n        Purpose Dog Foods are formulated to meet the nutritional levels established by the AAFCO Dog Food Nutrient Profiles for All Life Stages.\n                     At Purpose, we believe in giving back to our communities. Since we are based in Queens, New York, backers have the option of donating Purpose products to the following local New York City animal rescues. \nOr, specify a rescue of your choice and we'll ship them your donated products! \nRescue Dogs Rock NYC\nWaggytail Rescue\n  Know someone who might like our freeze-dried diets or want to support our mission? \nShare the campaign with your friends and family so that they can also get this special deal.\n \nThank you very much for your support. \n    ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are awaiting our order of Purpose bags and will go into production as soon as we receive them.

The host of an exceptionally popular Youtube channel, Neck Beard travels the world putting the hurt on all creatures great and small.\nAided and abetted by his cameraman Buck, Neck Beard tackles all manner of paranormal monsters, from werewolves to zombies to vampires. Nothing is out of bounds for Neck Beard, Hillbilly For Hire!\nWHY YOU SHOULD CARE\nNeck Beard is a brand new 4-issue mini-series from creators Mark Bertolini, Joe Koziarski, Ellie Wright, and Micah Myers.

Which means that we've got enough to finance our film's opening sequence, in addition to the visual effects.\nHuge thanks to our generous backers!\nAnything else we can raise before the doors close will give us more flexibility in how we can achieve our ambitious workload. In the extremely unlikely scenario that we raise 60K, we will make training materials based on our visual effects work, release all of our Blender assets creative commons (BY-NC) after the film's release, and ship every backer who pledged $100 or more an extra print - of a full resolution frame from the film.\nThank you for getting us to this incredible milestone!\n--Colin & the SKYWATCH team\n----------------------\nTHE FILM\nIn the near future, a pair of mischievous friends hack into the infrastructure of a drone delivery system. As they reroute orders zipping through the sky, they set off a chaotic series of events and soon find themselves on the run from forces they can barely see.\nSKYWATCH is an original sci-fi short that I\u2019ve been working on for the past couple years. This project is designed to stand alone as a fun and gripping piece of entertainment, but is also intended to serve as a proof of concept for a mid-range live-action feature. Our goal is to build a world, set a tone, and introduce characters that could form the foundation of a compelling feature film. \nThis has been a passion project for me and my core team. Throughout the process, we have relied heavily on the generosity of friends and volunteers. Now, we\u2019re in postproduction - with over 150 visual effects shots to execute. We\u2019ve got a good head start, but we need your help to complete the remaining shots. \nThis Kickstarter campaign will fund the visual effects and remaining production to get this project across the finish line. When the short is finished, we will be releasing it for free online - for the world to watch!\nTHE TEAM\nOur two young leads are rising stars Uriah Shelton (The Glades, Warrior\u2019s Gate, Girl Meets World) and Zach Callison (Steven Universe, Mr. Peabody & Sherman), who deliver excellent performances. \nOur talented leads Uriah Shelton & Zach Callison\nOur core creative team has made up of longtime friends and collaborators: myself (writer/director Colin Levy) producer Andre Danylevich, VFX Supervisor Sandro Blattner, and DP Adam Habib. The short was production designed by Julie Chen, Morgan Johnson is supervising the sound, and Jasper Blunk is composing the score. The talented Mike Sundy is co-authoring the feature screenplay, based on the short.\nPREVIOUS WORK\nBefore dedicating myself to SKYWATCH, I worked at Pixar Animation Studios as a Camera & Staging Artist, working on several features including INSIDE OUT and FINDING DORY, and serving as the Camera DP for the animated theatrical short LAVA.\n  I also have directed several short films in the past, including THE SECRET NUMBER, which was successfully funded on Kickstarter, and the animated short SINTEL, which has over 4.5M views on YouTube - and was made entirely with the Open Source software Blender.\nVisit my PORTFOLIO SITE for more.\nWORLD & THEMES\nSKYWATCH takes place in a future defined by immediacy and convenience. In the world of our short film, you can order anything - anytime, anywhere - and have it delivered into your home in minutes. A physical pipeline now exists in every home, building and skyscraper - pneumatic tubes that funnel products right to your fingertips. But at what cost? Our short explores themes of voyeurism and surveillance, privacy, identity, and control. In some ways, we\u2019re telling a cautionary tale about the sacrifices we make in the name of convenience - in a future where corporations have immense power and control over how and what we consume.\nTHE VISUAL EFFECTS\nOur VFX team has high standards. Our lofty aim is for SKYWATCH to be visually indistinguishable from a Hollywood blockbuster. Of course, working without the resources of a studio has meant making sacrifices \u2013 in our case, time. Our small but dedicated international team started modeling, shading and rigging our assets in early 2015. Now, our key assets are complete - and it\u2019s time for the animation, lighting and compositing of shot work. We\u2019ve made it through two of our six sequences, but we still have over 150 shots to complete.\nWe chose to use the Open Source 3D software Blender for the CG work in this project. Even after using Pixar\u2019s Presto for years, Blender remains my favorite tool for 3D. Partially due to the thriving community of artists and potential collaborators, we have developed a Blender-centric pipeline that also includes Nuke and Houdini - and we\u2019ve been very pleased with the results.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nRaising $35K is literally the bare minimum we need to be able to bring on freelance VFX artists to finish the film. This figure doesn't include the additional photography that we still need for our film\u2019s opening, nor any funds for the final tasks of music/color/sound design. For a variety of reasons, it would be phenomenal to have a bit more wiggle room in the budget. \nWe know it's a longshot, but better to be overambitious, right? Here are our Kickstarter STRETCH GOALS:\n$45,000 - PRODUCTION: In addition to sound, music and color, we will be able to finance production for our film's \"cold open.\u201d Although it was in our original shooting script, we\u2019ve simply not had the bandwidth to tackle it - which I think is a daggone shame! This stretch goal would pay for actors, food, crew, and the same high end film gear that was used for principal photography. Help me make my original vision a reality!\nIf we reach this stretch goal we will make some of our HERO ASSETS available to our backers in .blend format. Play with the rigs, examine our node trees, or create your own animations!\n$60,000 - VFX VENDOR: At this level, instead of hiring individual freelancers for visual effects, which requires a huge amount of coordination and overhead, we can consider working with a small studio or VFX vendor. Which would be awesome! With these additional resources, we could get the work done in less time - and perhaps achieve a couple additional dream shots while we\u2019re at it.\nIf we hit this stretch goal, we will make training materials based on our visual effects work, release all of our Blender assets creative commons (BY-NC) after the film's release, and ship every backer who pledged $100 or more an extra print - of a full resolution frame from the film.\n$100,000 - IDEAL BUDGET: To be honest, even 60K is chump change for most VFX vendors. With this stretch goal, we would assuredly be able to find a suitable studio, and could accomplish all our goals for VFX and remaining production without sacrificing quality - or asking people to work for free. And while I\u2019m dreaming, I'd love to develop a website and produce a fictional TV commercial for our near-future drone delivery service, which I feel could be a great companion piece for the short!\nTHE REWARDS\nWe\u2019re excited to finally share a glimpse of the film with the world! If you like what you see, we hope you consider backing the project. \nWe have some nifty rewards - but you'll notice that a lot of 'em are digital. For this campaign, I\u2019d like to really focus on putting as many dollars on the screen as possible - and make sure we can deliver our rewards in a timely fashion. Thank you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSKYWATCH is an ambitious project and while we are confident in our abilities and our track record, we have a lot of work ahead of us! As with every film project we've done, there will be bumps in the road - challenges and unforeseen circumstances that will affect how we move ahead. But in bringing the project to this point, we have already had our fair share - and have gotten pretty good at rolling with the punches!\n\nIt's probably worth saying that there has been an incredible amount of sweat, blood, time and money invested in this project already - so there's no way we're *not* going to get it done.\n\nPerhaps a more relevant concern is the Kickstarter rewards themselves - that takes a lot of work too!

Inspired by the music of Lana Del Rey, Baroque Pop is a carefully curated selection of short form comics and illustrations celebrating love, loss, success, and change by comic creators who came together after finding mutual solace and inspiration in her music.\nCover by Jim Towe\n Baroque Pop is both an homage to Lana as well as a testament to the imagery and symbolism this modern day muse draws out of artists and writers. Her melodies invoke a sense of longing and wonder and endless hope. Mixed with instrumental tracks that feel cinematic in scope, her tunes practically invite the imagination to run wild painting tiny pictures with the emotions released in every bar, in every hook, until each album resembles a mosaic reflecting our deepest desires and secrets with each subsequent listening\nIn keeping with the music theme, the book itself will be printed at 7x7 inches to physically resemble a 45 RPM record cover.\nSince production on the anthology is close to being wrapped, this campaign is to help fund a modest printing run so we will be able to start shipping out the books right away.\nThe book features seven short stories by:\n\u2662 Chuck Harrison & Luke Marrone\n\u2662 Daniel Charles & Ashley St. Lawrence (with Scott Ewen)\n\u2662 Jennie Wood & Chris Goodwin\n\u2662 Enrica Jang & Jan Velazquez\n\u2662 Mario Candelaria & Katarzyna Witerscheim\n\u2662 Michael Lynch & Mira Mortal\n\u2662 Eric Palicki & Daniel Earls\nAnd five portraits by:\n\u2662 Jim Towe\n\u2662 Adam Ferris (feat. Lesley Atlansky)\n\u2662 John Keaveney\n\u2662 Hoyt Silva\n\u2662 Fabian Lelay (feat Lesley Atlansky)\nWe are coming to Kickstarter because this is a small creator owned passion project that was put together entirely by fans of Lana. While we have high hopes, anthologies are still a very niche market that many mainstream publishers will not take a chance on unless there are big rewards in it for them. This is a book by the fans for the fans and we have known this from the project's conception.\nPutting this anthology together ourselves means we have direct control of how the final product looks. A painstakingly large level of detail has gone into designing this book. From the beginning we set out to distinguish ourselves from other anthologies. From the 7x7 square shape of the book to the higher quality paper to the perfect gold foil on the cover, everything was designed to put quality over quantity and that expense is reflected below in the goal.\nSince the book has been completed it will still be released if we do not make our goal, but it will remain in a digital format until the collective can raise the funds to produce a modest print run -- and given this age of pirating, that would likely take a while. This is a passion project and it needs passionate support.\nGoal breakdown.\n                             UPDATE: NEW STRETCH GOALS ADDED\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe anthology has already been produced and is ready for the printing phase.

I\u2019m usually here asking for your support on a new comic project, but this time I need your help with something a little different.\nI'm here seeking funds to produce my pocket size thumbnail sketch book for cartoonists: THUMB BOOK. \n ALL REWARDS WILL SHIP IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS 2016!\n WHERE IT ALL STARTED:\nLike most cartoonists and comic artists, I did my thumbnails on loose paper and I would inevitably lose them in the sea of paper in my studio. My initial solution was an improvised thumbnail template stapled together. I\u2019ve been refining this template and booklet for the past two years.\nThumbnails from last year's prototype Thumb Book.\nLast year I made a prototype Thumb Book that I shared with some of my cartoonist friends and got some great feedback. I\u2019ve incorporated that feedback into this final version of the THUMB BOOK.\nThumb Book cover and inside template.\nSPECS:\nThe THUMB BOOK is 4.25\u201dx 5.5\u201dand is currently 66 pages - I'm hoping to add pages via stretch goals if possible - designed to be a pocket sized sketch book with a template on each page that corresponds to the layout of a standard comic page. Originally created to help me keep all my preliminary work in one spot, I also like them because I can grab a script, pencil, Thumb Book and hit a coffee shop if I need a change of scenery.\nSEQUENTIAL ART TEACHERS:\nIn addition to working in comics, I am also an adjunct professor at Pennsylvania College of Art and Design. In this coming Spring semester I\u2019ll be teaching a class called Visual Storytelling and I want to incorporate these sketchbooks into the curriculum. If this campaign is successful, I\u2019ll be providing all 20 students with THUMB BOOKS.\n-If you teach a sequential art/comics based art class and think these books could be helpful for your students, please shoot me a message.\nHOW I USE THEM:\nOnce I have a script in hand I do small breakdowns four up on the Thumb Book page. After that each breakdown gets taken to a full (Thumb Book) page layout. I try and make those thumbnails as tight as possible. I then scan those thumbnails and enlarge them to begin the penciling stage.\nMy two part Thumb Book process.\nI believe that minutes spent refining thumbnails will save hours on the finish of the final page. \nTHUMBNAIL THEATER:\n24 page, same size thumbnail mini comic reproduction of my one-shot issue: THE BANG. Hopefully the first in a series of thumbnail mini comics.\nWHO ELSE COULD USE THESE?\nThe Thumb Book is designed for cartoonists, but I have writer friends that used them to do rough layouts they pass along to the art team with their scripts. The Thumb Book can also be used for story boarding and includes a page in the back that details how to make various aspect ratios from the existing template.\nREWARDS:\nI\u2019ve included reward tiers where you can just try out one book, order multiples or sponsor a class and provide them with Thumb Books.\nPost it note commission examples\nI\u2019ve also got a bunch of original art rewards in case any non-cartoonist friends would like to support the project. \n-If there\u2019s some combination of rewards you would like and don\u2019t see on here, just drop me a message and we\u2019ll get it sorted out!\nOriginal thumbnail examples.\n  MOTHER RUSSIA mini series reward.\n   MOTHER RUSSIA sketch cover examples.\n  11x17 original art and thumbnail examples.\nTHANKS FOR LOOKING! \nI've found these little books to be very helpful and have designed my comic making process around them. I hope they might be helpful to other creators too.

But you have to accept it, because your other option? Kill yourself...or stop looking in mirrors.\nSleep Inertia Pilot Slicing Through the Foam of the Days Like a Radial Saw on a Stone Heart is a very personal story for Valentin, and is unlike anything he has created before. It is a unique and sublime reading experience, one we want to share with readers. We will use the funds raised to create this 100-page masterpiece, print copies and ship them to backers, so everyone can experience this once-in-a-lifetime graphic novel.\na Graphic Novel by Valentin Ramon\n  In a future that is just around the corner, people have given up on living their own lives and have allowed governments and corporations to dictate their fate. \nWhy people leave their lives in the hands of fate and the day-to-day inertia of living is still a mystery for everyone.\nSIP is the story of a 100-year-old woman who refuses to die at a time where the average lifespan ends at 70. She has been waiting for a long time to die, but demands to control the moment and manner that she dies in. If you knew you were going to die, wouldn\u2019t you want to choose the time and place and reason it happens, and make your death worth something?\nSIP is about how everything that is around us makes us who we are and how the reality that surround us can sometimes not be what it seems to be. This book has a pacemaker made of sad drama at its heart, and a brain tumor of black comedy plaguing it.\n  Page 1\n  Page 2\n  Page 3\n  Page 4\n  Page 5\n  Page 6\n  SIP is a 100-page original graphic novel with a fixed 8 panel grid per page. It's a story about love, loss and melancholia written and illustrated by Valentin Ramon, best known for his work as the illustrator of D4VE and Hot Damn (IDW), with co-writer Mark Bertolini, creator of Scum of the Earth (Action Lab Danger Zone), and Micah Myers (Action Lab, Zenescope, Scout) on letters.\n  We choose Kickstarter for the freedom that it gives us as creators. To have total freedom on the creative side with a project like this is always the most important thing a creator can ask for. While we love to work with publishers, sometimes having someone overseeing the project and asking you to take this out and put that in will change the sense of the book, especially when it is such a personal story. We want to create something unique for readers. After the cost to print and ship the book, plus Kickstarter's fees, the remaining funds will be used to buy time for the authors to create the book.\n  We have all been working in the comic book industry for a long time, and we have never missed a deadline, and we don\u2019t plan on missing this one either.

It\u2019s a dark and moody fairy tale that we\u2019re telling through 82+ pages of sequential art and verse. It\u2019s half poetry, half comics and appropriate for all ages.\nThe good news about this project is it's already done. The only thing that remains is for a beautiful hardcover edition to be printed up, but in order to do that we need money - specifically $5500 to cover the cost of printing the book for our backers, covering Kickstarter and CC fees, and meeting the minimum quantity required by our printer. Any left over copies of the book we'll have we'll be able to sell at shows, to book and comic stores, and on places like Amazon. \nWe\u2019re selling the hardcover for 25 bucks which we feel is the ideal format to read this story in, however if digital is more your thing we\u2019re offering that too. \nSo here we are. Asking for your help in making this book a reality. If you look over our reward tiers I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find something that works for you.

That chaos continues in Volume Three: Hey Mom, Why So Tense? \n In Volume Three, while shapeshifting, Lily gets stuck in a body, but not just any body - her mother's. Forced to see the world through the eyes of her estranged mother, Lily must accept that she'll never live a \"normal life\" in order to fulfill her true destiny. \nFlutter is a comic series that began over five years ago in a writing class at Grub Street, Boston's independent writing center. Since then, Flutter has been featured on Law & Order: SVU, in The New York Times, and in the Boston Globe. Flutter is one of the best LGBT graphic novels of 2013 and 2015, according to The Advocate. Bleeding Cool lists it as one of the 15 best indie comics of 2014. \nMost recently, the Virginia Library Association named Volume Two a 2015 Graphic Novel Diversity Award Honor Book. Volume Two was also named a 2015 INDIEFAB Book of the Year finalist by Foreword Reviews. For me, though, the biggest thrill of all was when comic legend Gail Simone described Flutter, Volume One as \"a truly thrilling graphic novel.\"\n I have always envisioned Flutter as a three volume graphic novel series, so this is the final volume of this story arc. I'm a 'never say never' person, so I'm not saying that this is the very end of all things Flutter. There's a chance that it will show up in another format, but this story arc, this graphic novel series published by 215 Ink, is ending with Volume Three.\nTo celebrate, we're combining all three volumes into THE FLUTTER COLLECTION, a 300+ page full color book, and offering it as a reward in this Kickstarter campaign. Only a limited number of THE FLUTTER COLLECTION will be printed. This campaign is the only place where you can guarantee that a copy is yours. \nThe Flutter Collection combines all three volumes in one 300+ page full color book\n Who Is Flutter?\nFlutter is Jeff (FUBAR) McComsey, Chris Goodwin, Jeff (THE TICK) McClelland, and me. \nFlutter, Volume One started with me writing the script and Jeff McComsey doing everything else: art, colors, and lettering. Jeff and I met through a mutual friend who was teaching the comic / graphic novel writing class that I took at Grub Street. \nMcComsey and I decided to expand the team for Volume Two, adding Chris Goodwin as colorist and Jeff McClelland as letterer. The way Chris got involved was pretty funny. Chris and I both had day jobs at the same publisher. When he stopped by to tell me he was leaving his job, I told him that McComsey and I needed a colorist for Volume Two. When I mentioned the date we needed the pages by, Chris said, \"That's crazy! That's impossible!\" \nHe came back to my desk twenty minutes later and said he wanted to try to meet the crazy, impossible deadline. The result was Volume Two. \nJeff McComsey and Chris Goodwin, NYCC 2015\nAll four of us are back for Volume Three. As well as lettering, Jeff McClelland will also be handling the editing duties of both Volume Three and THE FLUTTER COLLECTION. \nMcClelland has been in the trenches with me at comic conventions and with print deadlines. He is always there with a bottle of Cheerwine and a solution for making any situation, any page of Flutter better. \nJeff McClelland and Me, SDCC 2016\nWhy We Need Funds \nFlutter is an indie comic on a very small press. We prefer it that way because we get to tell the story we want to tell, how and when we want to tell it. However, that means the burden of the production and printing costs falls on us. \nProducing and printing full color 100+ page graphic novels is expensive. Like with our previous Flutter, Volume Two Kickstarter campaign, we need funds to produce and print enough copies of Volume Three to distribute it to comic stores. In addition, for this campaign, we also want to print a limited number of THE FLUTTER COLLECTION, a full color 300+ page book. \nRewards, Stretch Goals, and Add-Ons \nAlong with all the books, we have lots of other reward options. Jeff McComsey will draw you as an extra in Volume Three - you can even have a speaking role! There's also original and commissioned art by McComsey. The original art available for this campaign has been in multiple art exhibits this year. \nFlutter Original Art at Aviary Art Show, May 2016\nThere are special Cheerwine reward tiers, tributes to the soft drink from my hometown. The Cheerwine rewards include all the books and comics where the soft drink is mentioned. \nPage from a mini-comic in Honcho 3 Cheers\n  Part of the Jennie Wood Collection rewards\n  Part of the Cheerwine and Jennie Wood Collection Rewards\n We also have limited edition Flutter guitar picks and t-shirts. The Volume Two t-shirts from our last campaign will be available along with new options. You'll get to pick which one you want when we send out surveys. \nThese T-Shirts and More Will Be Available to Backers\nThere are Volume Three scripts with commentary, a writing class with me, and limited edition bookplates from McComsey. And the first 100 backers of this campaign get an extra reward! If you have any questions about the rewards or this campaign, please email me at jrnayslayer@gmail.com.\nBookplate Rewards by Jeff McComsey\nWe have stretch goals planned, so stay tuned for those. We'll also be offering Add-Ons later in the campaign. For example, if you're torn between a T-shirt and an original art reward, you'll get a chance to add-on items to the reward you've selected at a later date. More details on all this soon. Thank you for your time, consideration, and support! \nCheers,\nJennie\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nJuggling four different schedules can be tough, but members of this team have worked together now on multiple projects.

My name is April, I'm a self taught artist in Maryland. Art and creating have always been a passion of mine and through a lot of hard work I've been able to make it my full time job.\nSucker\n For the past 3 years I've focused all my energy on illustrating and creating art based goods, in order to share that passion with everyone. To keep this dream alive I have been traveling nearly every weekend to promote my work. While I am grateful for the adventures, I would also love a home base to truly call my own.\nChicago for C2E2\nMy work at an outdoor show, plus bonus stranger!\n\nMy dream has always been to open a retail store. I'm thinking Hampden, Baltimore. Having this space would allow me to keep my products readily available and give me more time to just WORK. Spending less time on the road will give me the opportunity to create more and become faster at my craft. Pretty soon, all this free time will allow me to take on more commissions (hooray for more portraits and tattoo designs!). But what makes my retail space so special is that this won't just be a space for my work or for just for my use. In this space I would invite other local artists to come hang out and draw with me. We can bounce ideas around, collaborate, learn, and motivate each other. Or to simply have company while we create. In return, creators can promote and sell their work through my shop. But my shop won't just be supporting local artists. I intend to regularly bring in international artists work to keep the shop new and exciting for shoppers and artists alike.\nIn order for me to put this together I need the space, advertising, supplies and just a whole bunch of other stuff. This is where I need your help. I've put together some pretty exciting rewards, including personal notes, handmade goodies, and original art! Let me break down some of these rewards for you. \n$10 donations get a randomly selected art postcard with a love note, hand written by me.

If we can hit this first stretch goal I am going to upgrade the covers to have spot UV and make them all extra special! It'll be great to have Maya and Kardunn's tail really pop on the cover + a THANK YOU PAGE for every backer at the $25 level and above.\nTHE STORY...\nThe Creators is a story about a small portion of the world's young population who suddenly develop the power to bring their imaginations to life through their drawings.  This power, fueled by adolescent emotion, is simultaneously awesome and extraordinarily dangerous as Creators are only limited by their imaginations.\nThe story of The Creators is told through the eyes of a young girl named Maya. After suffering a traumatic loss, Maya brings forth a very special creation named Kardunn, who serves as her protector and friend as they run from the Bureau of Creative Enforcement, a government agency developed to hunt down and deal with all young creators.\nTHE CAMPAIGN...\nI am proud to say that the book is completely finished. If you'd like you can check it all out at www.creatorscomic.com where it has lived for the past 2 years. The $5000 I am trying to raise with this campaign will be used to fund the printing of the full color, print edition of Volume 1 of The Creators. It will include chapters 1 through 6 of the comic - over 200 pages - that I have been working on for the last few years. Anything over the $5000 will be put towards stretch goals that will extend and add content to the book.\nREWARDS\u2026\nAlong with the book itself, I have come up with what I hope are some really exciting rewards and incentives for backing the campaign including...\n   STRETCH GOALS\u2026\nSTRETCH GOAL #1: $6500: Cover Upgrade!  If we can hit this first stretch goal I am going to upgrade the covers to have spot UV and make them all extra special!  It'll be great to have Maya and Kardunn's tail really pop on the cover\nSTRETCH GOAL #2 - $7500: One of my favorite parts of any graphic novel is the sketchbook section that highlights the character development process of a book. If we can hit $7500, I intend to go through the pages and pages of creature/creation sketches and hand pick the very best ones and make a sketchbook section to extend the book. It will include early sketches of characters that ended up in the book and sketches of creations that never made an appearance at all.\nSTRETCH GOAL #3 - $8,500: An 8 page guest comic illustrated by Kelsey Wailles of Super Art Fight and Doctor Kawai and written by yours truly will be added to the book. There are so many stories in the Creators universe that I just can't tell within the confines of the narrative but wish I could get out there. This short comic will look at a creator who is in a very different environment than any we see throughout the book. On top of that, Kelsey's lighthearted and animated visual style mixed with my darker storytelling makes for a really interesting collaboration.\nSTRETCH GOAL #4 - $10,000: Another guest comic! A 6 page comic written and illustrated by Alex Kazanas of Super Art FIght and the One Piece podcast. This story finds a way to cleverly explore ancient mythology and a troubled father and son relationship while fitting in beautifully to the creators universe.\nSTRETCH GOAL #5 - $12,000: A Pinup section will be added to the book! The final stretch goal will collect all of the amazing pinups I have gotten from colleagues in the comic and illustration world and add them to the book. This includes work from Nick 'Ghost Free Hood' DiFabbio, Jamie Noguchi (ypcomic.com) and more!\nProducing this book has been a labor of love and a dream that I have followed for the past 4 years and I am excited to continue on with it. For anyone who has read and supported the comic so far, I thank you. To anyone about to take the leap and support this campaign, I hope you love this book as much as I loved making it.

He identified the marks and she fleeced them for millions. But when Julia walks into their empty New York penthouse, she realizes she only has a few minutes before Adrian's set-up puts her away for all their crimes. Julia makes a breathtaking escape and sets about her revenge by recruiting a team of thieves to steal Adrian's big scores before he can disappear to a life of ill-gotten luxury.\nWhat's Your Angle?  \nLet's turn this:  \nFancy script pages\nInto this:\nFancier comic pages\nWith your help, we can turn Girls Heist Out from a collection of witty banter, assorted script pages and scenes in my head into a limited comic book series. Our goal nets us four digital issues that will be collected and printed into a physical trade paperback. You can follow along digitally when each issue releases or wait to read the whole story in one binge read.\nWe have a great artist on board to breath life into the characters of Girls' Heist Out. Manuela Soriani nailed the look and feel of the text. You see some examples throughout this page with new samples slated for sharing with backers throughout the fundraising campaign.\nWhat's In It for Me? \nThe script: As a backer of this Kickstarter, you become a player in this saga as it unfolds. You will receive a PDF of the first issue\u2019s script \u2013 giving you a first hand look into the Girls\u2019 Heist Out world before copies hit the shelves. Backers at any level can check out the working script for issue #1 right here.\nDigital Issues: We'll be offering individual issues digitally. Single physical issues are out of my budget, but we expect regular digital releases to tide supporters over until the whole book comes out. \nTrade paperback: If we hit our funding goal, we'll print a trade paperback collecting all four issues of the mini-series. Stretch goal materials may include sketches and other add-ons that won't be repeated in subsequent printings of the book. \nPlay games with the designer: Rob's worked on dozens of tabletop games over the past two decades. He will run a session any of those games over an internet chat client for you and your friends.\nProduct placement: Ever notice how in the movies, certain brands have prominence in the shot, while others are covered up or minimized? We'll work with you to integrate your business into a panel or two of an issue. \nAliases: Seeing your name in print is a rare treat. Backers at these levels will work with Rob to see their names (or the names of their loved ones) used in the comic. You might get a chance to be an alias or even have a minor character named after you!\nCameos: There are plenty of thugs and security guards that will challenge the girls during their heists. Manuela has agreed to put some backers into the comic in these minor roles. All you have to do is pledge high enough and send up a couple of photos for her to use as reference. \nThe mastermind (SOLD OUT!): Our BIGGEST reward is to be the bad guy pulling the strings at the end. This villain features prominently in the last issue. There's only ONE of these rewards available to a very generous backer.\nWhat About Stretch Goals?\nAll part of the plan.

Too many horror stories from other Kickstarter creators leaves me in a bind. Either I don't offer shipping to countries outside the US and lose a large source of potential backers or I watch as I send out packages that get damaged, destroyed or lost after international backers are already reeling from high shipping costs. Should Girls' Heist Out fund, I will look into international options after the Kickstarter, but I can only offer digital goods for those backers outside the US at this time.\nWhat About Add-Ons?\nTo add one of these items on to your pledge, just increase the pledge by the amount of the add-on.\n$10: An additional copy of an art print available to all backer levels receiving physical rewards.\n$20: An additional copy of the comic book available to all backer levels receiving physical rewards.\n$80: Rob will run one of the many games he's worked on as a game designer in one four hour session over an internet chat program for you and up to five other friends.

I've been telling stories on tabletops for twenty years. I've worked on big licenses like Shadowrun, Firefly and Star Wars. I've worked on small games like Our Last Best Hope, CHILL 3rd Edition and The Edge of Midnight. My own worlds include CAMELOT Trigger and Save Game. \nComics mean a lot to me. My grandfather taught me to read using comic books. I want to step out from tabletop game writing into creating comic books and Girls' Heist Out is the first story that's demanded to be told. I believe that creative people should consume what they create and it is a great time to be a comic book fan. This is a story inspired by my love of Darwyn Cooke and Ed Brubaker's Catwoman run, Gail Simone's Batgirl and Kurtis Wiebe's Rat Queens. \nManuela Soriani: Artist, colorist, master of bubbles\nManuela Soriani lives in the same small town in northern Italy where she was born in 1979, in the heat of summer and fog in winter, near the river Po. Manuela studied to become an accountant but Art asked to be part of her life. So she answered the call, found a teacher (and later, friend), and became an artist.\nAfter six years in comic books for the Italian market (including Jonathan Steele for Star Comics), Manuela began creating both traditional paper books and animated apps for electronic devices. In early 2016, she ran a successful Kickstarter for her first illustration book \u201cButterflies\u201d and is working on the comic series TIN (by Ilya Dvilyanski) and BoyLord (by Nathan Peabody). She loves cats (she has two), the colors pink and orange, cooking, tabletop and roleplaying games (she enjoys some game design from time to time), videogames, and all forms of art.\nWhy Is It So Important To You?\nGrowing up as a kid in the 80's, I got to see movies and TV shows full of strong women kicking ass and taking names. Characters like Princess Leia, Ellen Ripley, Wilma Deering and Marion Ravenwood didn't swoon in the face of danger and got to play just as dirty as the boys did. I always admired clever heroes the most and these women always seemed to be one step ahead of the game. There are modern day equivalents, of course, like Furiosa, Rey and Starbuck, but we can always use more women who can think on their feet, talk their way out of (or into) trouble and throw down when there is no other option.\nThis idea became even more important to me at the beginning of this year. Girls' Heist Out is a couple years old as a project, but my daughter was born in January. She's already made this year a runaway smash success, but if I can help bring these characters to life and show her women not afraid to fight for what they want, I will feel like Dad of the Century. With your help, we can be holding these books in hand by her first birthday.\nAlready plotting something.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nManuela and I have been involved in several Kickstarters in a variety of capacities, but this is our first foray together.

Stanley landing in what was once North Carolina on a mission to reach the stronghold of Charlotte.   \nHe claims to be on a mission for a president no one has heard of on behalf of a country that hasn't existed in 15 years.  \nThe central question of the story: Just how crazy is Captain Stanley?\nHONCHO will be 75 pages to start but I hope to add pages for stretch goals.\nIs he a damaged veteran of a nuclear world war finally returning home or a man on a top secret mission for the sitting president of a United States government in exile?  \nUpon his arrival, he discovers a weird tribal structure made up of orphans from the civil wars that broke out in America post WWIII.  \nThese tribes have formed up around local baseball teams and team pride is perhaps the most important thing to this new way of life. If you\u2019ve got a good arm then the sky\u2019s the limit. If not, then you\u2019re in deep shit.  \nSTRETCH GOALS!\n   THE BANG!\nCOVER ART BY BRETT WELDELE\nWe\u2019re also offering a 24 page one shot prequel to HONCHO called THE BANG which will be available with all reward tiers at $30 and over.  \nThis one-shot lays out the events that led up to the short and brutal Third World War that takes place in 1983, fifteen years before the events in HONCHO.\nTHE TEAM!\nHONCHO will be co-written by myself and FUBAR Story Editor Jeff McClelland( THE TICK). I\u2019ll be handling the art with colors by Mr. Paul Little( MORNING GLORIES, SONS OF ANARCHY).\nWe\u2019re asking for funds to set aside the time and make these stories a reality.\nREWARDS!\nTo get there we have a bunch of cool rewards where you can own both books, original art from either HONCHO or THE BANG, T-shirts, prints and a bunch of other sweet merch including some of my previous work like MOTHER RUSSIA and the AMERICAN TERROR series. We also have the kickstarter packages from our previous campaigns which both contain out of print books and comics!\nIf successful we plan to add pages on to both HONCHO and THE BANG through stretch goals as well as adding some other fun one shots too!  \nKickstarter remains the best place to offer new books to old fans first and make some new ones along the way.\nAs always, thank you for your time and thank you for your support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my sixth campaign so I know a lot of the pitfalls and how to avoid them when it comes to Kickstarters.

At $3,500 I could have the interiors be spot color. I really dig a lot of books that have used this and the digital version looked great this way... So LETS GO!!!!\nAll My Ghosts is FINISHED!!! \nIt's been published by ALTERNA Comics digitally through Comixology and other platforms now we need funds to print physical copies. It's 110 pages and it's dimensions are 7x7.  It's even going to be in Diamond and all that jazz we just need to cover the printing costs. There's a release date for February so let's get rolling!!\nTHE STORY\nAll MY Ghosts is about a newspaper man named Joe Hale. He owns and operates a local newspaper in a small Appalachian town a lot like mine. Times are tough and the economy is down the tubes so Joe is forced to sell the paper to an outside company that flips dying newspapers. The newspaper has been in Joe\u2019s family for four generations so naturally there is a lot of guilt over his decision. Once the deal is made strange things start to happen\u2026 Joe starts slowly slipping out of control and writing abrasive opinion columns that start to piss off his readers and the community. Even Joe's friends and family start to drift away. Not only that but the building itself seems to be reacting to the changes brought on by the buyout. Strange possibly supernatural occurances become more frequent and eventually all of these events snowball into a jarring climax that will change Joe forever.\nTHIS PROJECT IS VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO ME \nI wrote the story, drew the pages and lettered the whole book. While doing this comic my family and I went through a lot of stuff, the death of both of my wife's parents, the birth of my second kid and on and on, and despite that I still finished it myself. The book is about the place I grew up and still live in, the Appalachian Mountains of Virginia. Like in the comic my town is in the middle of a harsh economic recession. The coal industry that once thrived here is all dried up and unemployment has skyrocketed. I wanted to do a book about the area and my experiences in this modern, southern, mountain town. \nTHE ORIGIN\nI struck on the idea of using a newspaper as a backdrop from my own experiences. I worked for a few years at a local newspaper as a graphic designer. Shortly after I started there the company was sold after being in the family of the owners for a number of decades. I also heard stories about noises and disturbances at night from the people who worked there late. Now we could chalk it up to exhaustion but I myself once saw a pretty freaky apparition out of the corner of my eye that rattled me working late one Sunday night. The idea for the book came from this time in my life.\nREWARDS!!\nAt every level you get THE BOOK! There are also some cool prints available, a t-shirt, this B-horror slasher flick based on a comic I did and of course original page art!! Cool stuff!!!\nPrints\n T-Shirt \n DVD", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf everything is printed on time all of the rewards and books should get to you guys no later than the end of FEBRUARY 2016.

Jane drank more than she wrote, worried more than she worked, and had more epically disastrous love affairs than completed books. By almost any measure, Jane led a fascinating life filled with literary giants and great adventure and I want to bring her story to life.\nSketches of Jane at various ages by Tyler Jenkins\n\u201cAlthough unknown to the general public, the Bowleses were famous among those who were famous.\u201d \u2013 Gore Vidal \n\u201cMy only complaint against Mrs. Bowles is that she publishes so infrequently. One would prefer larger quantities of her strange wit, thorny insight. Certainly she is one of the really original pure stylists.\u201d \u2013 Truman Capote \nThis Kickstarter is going to help fund the creation and publication of chapter one of an original graphic novel written by me, Katy Rex, about Jane\u2019s life. This book will be published as a standalone issue and follow Jane\u2019s life from childhood up until a freak accident on a horse that led her to be diagnosed with tuberculosis of the knee. It includes art from Tyler Jenkins (Peter Panzerfaust, Neverboy) on the main biography, and June Vigants on the short story, in full color with a stunning and evocative palette from Kelly Fitzpatrick (Sensation Comics). Editor Kirsten Thompson contributes a unique perspective on history and feminism. It will also include Jane\u2019s short story, A Stick Of Green Candy, about the nature of love and childhood innocence and the death of imagination. An inset medical diagram art piece from artist Kate Lacour will detail the intricacies of joint tuberculosis. This campaign will allow the project to continue and build into a full length book, and will be an opportunity for backers to get the exclusive rewards that will not be available once the book is fully produced. This single extra thick issue, coming in at a full 28 printed pages, will also feature an essay from Lauren Spohrer, editor of the online magazine Two Serious Ladies, which publishes original poetry and prose from women around the world.\ntuberculosis of the knee as rendered by artist Kate Lacour\nThis original graphic novel will follow Jane Bowles' life in ten chapters. In each chapter, there is an adaptation of one of her short stories, and each short story is adapted by a different artist. The artistic team adapting short stories includes art from Dom Sole, Betsy Peterschmidt (Boys with Wings), Ines Estrada (Ojitos Borrosos, Lapsos), June Vigants (Chainmail Bikini, Tales of the Night Watchman), Joshua Hixson (The Rebel Gun), Anne Maxson, Beatrice Penco Sechi (Lady Doll), Ryan Kelly (Lucifer, Local), Adam Gorham (Zero, Kill Shakespeare), and Sean Von Gorman (Toe Tag Riot, Pawn Shop), with a Kickstarter-exclusive cover by Marguerite Sauvage (Thor, Ninjak, The Wicked + The Divine). In order to tie together her life and stories, colorist Kelly Fitzpatrick (Sensation Comics) is creating a unifying palette and letterer/designer Taylor Esposito (Ghost Glyph Studios) will be facilitating the flow of the work.\nbacker reward: Strange Wit flask, art not final\nVery few accounts of Jane\u2019s life exist in the realm of public consumption. Some things are broadly and culturally agreed upon: She had many sexual relationships with women, she wrote sparsely and strangely but with genius and style, and when she met her husband, she said to a friend, \u201cHe is my enemy.\u201d But the cultural mythos about Mrs. Bowles does very little to capture the very real and very unique person behind her strange persona.\nChapter one is completely scripted and the art is nearly complete. Help us get it printed, and YOU (yes, you!) can be eligible for a number of exciting rewards, including: \n\u2022 Digital and physical copies before they\u2019re available anywhere else \n\u2022 Set of 10 Postcards limited edition/numbered \n\u2022 An exclusive limited edition (numbered) print of Marguerite Sauvage\u2019s portrait of Jane \n\u2022 Thank-you letter, handwritten \n\u2022 Thank-you letter, handwritten while drunk \n\u2022 A mini-comic written & (poorly) drawn by Katy: cocktail recipes of the artistic elite \n\u2022 Options for original art from the creative team, including pages from the book and full color commissions\nOne of the cool things about working with a creative team of this scale is that we are able to collect work from each one of the short story artists in a unique set of 10 postcards. Each postcard comes from a place where Jane lived and worked at the time of the chapter in which that artist's short story is featured.\nTitle page by artist Tyler Jenkins\nSince the chapter is nearly done, rewards will be printed and shipped within a few months after the campaign ends. The money made in this Kickstarter, first and foremost, will be going toward fair page rates for the excellent and high-quality work from this diverse and unique creative team. With the full length graphic novel coming in at around 240 pages, it's not a small budget, and starting to fund it through Kickstarter brings it one step closer to being a reality. While this campaign primarily funds the production and printing of chapter one, if we surpass our goal we will be able to use the additional money to speed up the production of the final book.\nSample page from A Quarreling Pair artist Joshua Hixson\nThis book is fun to read, beautiful to look at, and covers a crucial topic in the marginalized history of LGBT artists. Thank you for considering pledging!\nUPDATE: After our awesome Comicosity interview, we decided it was probably a good idea to clarify some of our financial goals.\nThis Kickstarter is to print Chapter One of the book, and also to fund the artists' costs for the rest of the book. All backers WILL be getting a discount code for the finished graphic novel, but since that is still in the tentative future and being worked out logistically, it's not being formally included in this project. We know that $12,000 is steep for a single issue, and we're happy that so many of you are being so understanding about the rest of the creative team's needs, even though their work isn't being included in this issue. To make up for that, we're trying to pack as much unique and exclusive content into this mega-issue, including an essay and some concept sketches that will never make it into the final book and will only be available here on Kickstarter.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main obstacles this book faces are the size of the creative team and the legality of printing a book based on licensed intellectual property.

Yeah boyie!\nCheck out this sweet ass cover!\nMock-up of the final 6''x9'' 280 page book! Gonna be epic!\nHi, this is Ryan Browne, writer artist of the highly questionable comic, God Hates Astronauts (published first on Kickstarter, then by Image Comics). Off and on over the years, I have been producing Blast Furnace: Recreational Thief as a quick and silly improvisational comic book exercise, and now that it's an almost finished 280 page story, I need your help to print it. \nSay hello to Mr. Furnace!\nBlast Furnace is about a recreational thief named Ernest Furnace who steals just about anything in the name of fun and not for financial gain. BUT his story is constantly derailed by flashbacks, dream sequences, and side stories of owls on the run from the law, hideously deformed men who look just like a horse, lil' Draculas, and electricity shooting handlebar mustaches. It's totally bat $#!t crazy and a ton of nonsensical fun! \nIf you liked God Hates Astronauts, yet wish it featured more light-hearted thievery, then you will LOVE Blast Furnace!\nBlast Furnace has been a free webcomic since 2012. I've started updating the online version with fancy, full color pages which you can read by clicking this link!\nREAD THE FIRST TWO CHAPTERS OF BLAST FURNACE HERE!\nIn 2012, I Kickstartered the first six black and white issues of Blast Furnace into a small graphic novel. This new collection features all 12 issues of Blast Furnace (six old, six new) now presented in 280 pages of shockingly amazing full color.\nCheck out the old crappy version on the left, and the new super awesome full color version on the right!\nHere are some random pages full of goofs and gags. This thing is 280 pages so this is just the tip of the iceberg of hilarity!\nWith Blast Furnace, I wanted it to have a true improv feeling to the story. A collection of WTF moments all drawn together with a certain understandable logic. In order to do this, I have a certain set of rules I must follow\u2026\n1. NO PLANNING OR WRITING AHEAD: When I start a page, I have no idea what's going to happen on the next page and so on and so forth. I force myself to live within the page when I work on it and not look ahead to the next 10 or something.\n2. SPEND NO MORE THAN ONE HOUR ON EACH PAGE (not including the colors which I do later): That's right. I start with a blank page and no real idea what's going to happen, and then, an hour later, I have a fully written, penciled, and inked page of comicbookness.\n3. LET IT GO WHEREVER I FEEL LIKE: Blast Furnace is 280 pages. Knowing that ahead of time, I realized I was going to have a whole lot going on in this book. So anytime it interested me to divert from the story, via flashback, dream sequence, or even flash forwards, I did it. The end result is very wacky and stream of consciousness--but I swear it all kind of makes sense. Sort of.\nAND PLEASE ENJOY SOME MORE RANDOM PAGES FROM BLAST FURNACE, WON'T YOU?\nSo that's Blast Furnace. It's a comic that celebrates jokes, possibly offensive jokes, nonsense jokes, and flaming tie jokes. Nothing is overly crafted and nothing takes itself too seriously. Unlike God Hates Astronauts which is heavily planned and revised, Blast Furnace is my brain presented without a filter. If you like vengeful owls, flaming tie wearing master thieves, and hideously deformed men who look just like a horse; then you are in the right place.\nThere are so many pages in this book! It's just about done... here's a shot of 120 of the 280 (that's all I could fit on one screen!)\nCHECK OUT DEM REWARDS, Y'ALLS! On top of pre-ordering the 280 page book, I've got a bunch of other fancy reward levels on the right side, so check 'em out! Also, I've got some sweet stretch goals planned, so let's get this mother funded! Your money will be going directly towards printing the book, paying my color assistant, and paying for the shipping and materials. \nUPDATE! If you want to add a shirt to your backer level, simply add $25 for US orders, $30 for Canadian, and $35 for all other countries. At the end, you will fill out your survey and it will ask if you added money for a shirt. It'll work smoothly, don't worry. WOOT!\nThis super cool American Apparel shirt can be yours--if you dare!\nSimon, my wonderful cat, once graced the cover of God Hates Astronauts. NOW you can have a signed 4x6 Kickstarter exclusive photo of him to adore/scare people with!\nHere is a work in progress of the Blast Furnace 4'' figure by ManOrMonster Studios! Hand cast and painted, the final one will come carded in a blister pack. So fancy!\nUltimate God Hates Astronauts Combo Pack! The Hardcover, plus every issue, plus Blast Furnace!\nThe original art for the T-Shirt can be bought with monies!\nOriginal art pages from the book!\nThe original 11x17 cover drawing can be yours? Hell's yeah, it can!\nUnlike some Kickstarters, Blast Furnace: Recreational Thief will be finished and ready to go off to the printers at the end of this campaign. That's right, a 280 page print file will be ready to go as soon as I get the funding for the book. I have successfully produced both the first black and white Blast Furnace and the God Hates Astronauts hardcover through Kickstarter and fulfilled all orders within three months of the Kickstarter's conclusion. Basically, what I'm trying to say here is that I've put in the work and I've got my $#!t together. When, and if, this project gets funded, you are getting your book. It's only fair that I reward your pledge with an actual project ;)\nOh, and if you were lucky enough to back the first Blast Furnace book, I thank you so much for making the book happen back then and hope you don't mind having to buy the first six issues again--now with a huge color upgrade!\nHere's a wonderful segment from chapter 9 (That's right. This book is long as hell! What value!). Enjoy?\nWasn't that fun!? Hope ole' Pornupiss is okay!\nI've worked on books for Image Comics like Manhattan Projects, Bedlam, and a ten issue run of new God Hates Astronauts for the last few years, but now it's time for me to go back to the amazingness of direct funding through wonderful people like you.

You haven't seen enough? FINE! Check out some more pages in no particular order from Blast Furnace. This thing is freaking 280 pages long!

In the Grab \u2018N Go Guide, we leave the history to history, and give you information you will need \u201cOn the Go\u201d. The Grab \u2018N Go Guide is broken up into 7 sections:\nThe 7 Sections of the Guide\nThere is so much to the Grab \u2018N Go Guide that we are so proud of, but one of the key differences between our guide and other vacation planning guides is the laminate. \nFor years we struggled with different vacation planning guides getting ripped, spilled on, or soaked from the Florida rains. We have tested all kinds of paper and laminate to make sure we have the best protection for your guide while still making it light and easy to carry around. \nGetting the expert Inside Tips\nWhen it comes to Disney Tips, the Grab 'N Go Guide is full of them!  Whether you are looking for the perfect place to see the Illuminations Fireworks show, or want to be a \"Galactic Hero\" on Buzz Lightyear's Space Ranger Spin, the Grab 'N Go Guide has you covered!\nBuzz Lightyear's Space Ranger Spin - Double Max Points\nThe 7 tip categories you will find in the Grab 'N Go Guide:\nExpert Tip Categories\nHow is the Grab 'N Go Guide different from all of the other Disney guides out there?\nThere are a lot of things that make the Grab 'N Go Guide different from all of the other Walt Disney World guides. A few of the key things that set us apart are:\nQR codes, designed to link you directly to the source of the information you need\nQR Scanning\nThe Grab 'N Go Guide simplifies everything about a Walt Disney World vacation so that you can get back to having an amazing time\nExample of the Attraction Key\nOur guide features an easy-to-read and understand rating system of the best resorts, restaurants, attractions and dining\nExample of rating system that we use\nRelative wait times (good for ANY season)\nThe exact location where you can find EVERY Disney character on property in an easy to read chart\nExample of Character List\nComparisons of each resort side-by-side \nExample of Resort Comparisons\nThe best rooms in each resort for the best view, best for convenience, and best for privacy\nExample of Best Rooms\nEasy to navigate on the go with our helpful tabs\nEasy to create your own schedule of events, based on our suggestions (or not, you have the power!)\nExample of the Schedule creation\nCustom made Walt Disney World maps by our Chief Graphic Designer. The maps are so easy to use, and fun to draw on\nCustom map laminated maps\nThe wet-erase marker gives you the opportunity to take notes and write in the guide. To remove your notes when you\u2019re ready, simply use a wet napkin to wipe it away.   \nWe have tested several standard dry erase markers, and it just wipes off the pages too easily. Instead, we provide a wet erase marker that dries in seconds and will stay on the page until you wipe it off with any damp napkin or cloth.\nWet Erase Pen - Included!\nOur book features a special 6-ring binder, so you can replace the pages easily. This way, you can buy a new guide each year without having to get the binder again!\nAllowing you to customize your guide is so important to us, because there is no one-size-fits-all plan for everyone. The laminate that covers every page of the Grab \u2018N Go Guide has been tested, and is weather proof. Not only that, but you can also draw on it with your Expo wet erase marker. The best part is, the Expo Wet Erase marker is included with the Grab 'N Go Guide! \nExample of Drawing on the Custom Map\nOur Timeline\nThe guide is complete and undergoing a few cosmetic tweaks (to make it look great)! As soon as the Kickstarter campaign ends, we will take a few days to review every detail of the guide to make sure it is just right. We hope to have the Kickstarter rewards shipped by October.\nIf you are asking yourself why you should support our project, there are a lot of good reasons. One great reason that we want to highlight is the opportunity to have your picture (or name) in the book for generations to come.\nWe wholeheartedly believe that the Disney community is an extended family. We all come from different backgrounds, but we can all share our love and passion for Walt Disney World. \nWe want to offer you the opportunity be able to preserve your pictures (or name) in the book forever! \nCategories for backers\nBelow are the different reward categories. Don't forget you can be a part of multiple categories. (example: If you back us with $75 you can request the $65 reward plus the $10 reward. Be sure to specify this when you are submitting your total)\nBy backing us with $200, $300, or $400, you will preserve your name in history.

With every edition of the Grab \u2018N Go Guide that is printed your picture will appear.\n$500 & $2,000 Backer Pictures *Not actual size\nNote: Every year you can update your picture. All pictures will be reviewed and the authors may decline a picture and request a new one.\nExplained: Our Kickstarter Campaign Goal\nWe have looked for the best balance between quality and value with the Grab 'N Go Guide and we are thrilled with what we have come up with.\nOur hope is to offer a high quality product that everyone can enjoy, without breaking the bank. By offering it for a retail price of $34.95, we open up the opportunity for everyone to enjoy Disney World in a whole new way!\nWe have worked with the printers and manufacturers to get the best price possible. We found that we had 2 options, raise the price to our customers, or order a larger quantity. Rather then raise the cost to you and all of our customers, the best way to keep our cost low is to get a larger quantity.\nThe Importance of Quantity\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to raise the price for our extended Disney Family.\u201d - Michael\nHow we will use the Money\nWe have thought through how we will use every penny of the money that our backers use to support us.

Goal.\nFront of the Backer Shirt\nBack of the backer shirt\n Information about Kickstarter   \nSome of you may not be familiar with Kickstarter, so let's take a minute to talk about how this works.\nKickstarter is a \"crowdfunding\" platform. It works by bringing together crowds of people to help developers fund the completion of their project. Funds aren't exchanged until the end of the campaign has been reached and only if the pledge goal is reached.\nHere's how it works for you:\nYou make a pledge to support our campaign. You will receive a confirmation and be added to the pledge list. When the campaign ends, if the pledge goal is met, your card will be charged for the amount pledged.\nAfter the campaign is over, you will receive a survey that asks for details about shipping and other information that is needed to get your rewards to you. Be sure to be very careful when you fill out this survey so we can get your pledge reward to you.\nWhen the printing and manufacturing is done we will ship your reward out to the address on the survey.  \nYou can make multiple pledges and pledge more than the suggested amount.\nWe really do need your help\nWe are SO excited about the Grab \u2018N Go Guide to Walt Disney World, but we need your help to make it a reality. The cost of the weatherproof binder + the cost to print, laminate and ship the pages of the guide comes to $108,000 (minus Kickstarter fees). To get us on the road to success we need your support.\nWe can\u2019t express how much we appreciate your support!  Every little bit helps and we really thank you for helping us! \nNo matter how much you can support us, we would greatly appreciate it if you would share a link of our project on social media so we can get the word out.\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/GrabNGoGuide \nWe are really looking forward to making this project a reality, but without your support, we won\u2019t have the funding to get it rolling.\nA special thanks to our \"Friends of the Guide\":\nNate Tonnessen - Disney Dorks \nJessica Skowronski Kutcher Vasalos - We are ADDICTED to DISNEY WORLD\nSigris Lopez - Disney Vacation Club\nBrenda McGuire - 1,000,000 Disney Super Fans \nRich MK - Disney Obsessed\nRen\u00e9e & Dave - Addicted to Disney World - Advice, secrets and insider information\nWant to become a \"Freind of the Guide\"?

But their legacy remains.\nLike the smoky haze of a \u201870s arena show, a cloud of mystery and intrigue surrounds music\u2019s infamous \"27 Club.\"  Its members\u2014including Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Kurt Cobain, and Amy Winehouse, to name just a few\u2014revolutionized music in their youth, only to die at the age of 27. Is it a conspiracy, or merely a coincidence? \nUsing the music and mystery as inspiration, an all-star band of fifty-four creators were challenged to add a few new grooves to the mythological record of the 27 club. These stories are not adaptations of songs or a particular club-member\u2019s life. That\u2019s not how Red Stylo rolls! This isn\u2019t a cover-band\u2014it\u2019s a free-form jam session where our writer and artists use familiar melodies to create something entirely new!\nThat \u201csomething\u201d is 27, A Comic Anthology--212+ full color pages of original comics, art, and illustrated essays, all inspired by the music and rock stars of the 27 Club. Tracks run the gamut from hard-rockin\u2019 horror, dramatic dirges, classical comedies, and even a few outrageous outtakes that you just have to see!\n27 is the latest in Red Stylo\u2019s annual anthologies. For the last five years, we have hosted a face-melting festival for veteran artists and up-and-coming acts to unleash their comic arsenal on a roaring crowd of readers. But this year, we have a stronger lineup than ever before, and a theme for the ages. It\u2019s time to #ROCKHARD or stay home!\nWith this Kickstarter, we're going to leave it all on the stage with our very first premium hardcover: 27, A Comic Anthology: Rock Hard Edition.\nStretch goal #1 acheived! The #ROCKHARD Edition will be a signed, numbered and foil-stamped hardcover!\nThis will be a limited edition run: only 1000, signed and numbered copies of the #ROCKHARD Edition hardcover will be printed! The stories will live on in digital and trade paperback formats but, just like the rockers we\u2019re singing about, once they are gone, they\u2019re gone forever! Even if we shatter our initial goal, any extra money will go towards stretch goals to sweeten the sound of our rewards. The number of ROCK HARD Edition hardcovers printed by Red Stylo WILL NOT CHANGE!\nJim Morrison, Amy Winehouse, Brian Jones, Kurt Cobain, Janis Joplin...the names in the \"27 Club\" are of course famous. We have our own incredible team of creators in this collection:\nEdited by Red Stylo's EIC, Enrica Jang, joined by contributing Nix Comics Editor, Ken Eppstein, with introduction by \"27 Club\" scholar Dianna Kenny (featured in The Guardian, Vox and The Wall Street Journal.)\nOur contributors (and pieces) include:\nMario Candelaria and Sean Dillon (original story inspired by Janis Joplin)\nClub meeting, artist A.I.

I'm Glenn Fabry and welcome to my Kickstarter Project! This will be my first Kickstarter and the the 3rd Sketchbook I have created, compiled of commissions and unpublished work. This book will have 64 pages minimum and a minimum of 40 pages full color!\nImages in this sketchbook will include many previously unpublished Preacher, Hellblazer, Batman, Sandman, Slaine, Marvel, DC and horror images, there is even a sketch of Alan Moore in there! Also this time uniquely and thanks to the wonderful medium of Kickstarter I will have the chance to collaborate with you as the commissions you can make via the rewards will also be included in Sketchbook 3!\nMy overall goal is to one day make a giant art book with my own work and ideas inside. This all unfortunately takes quite a long time and a lot of effort. I cannot do it on my own I need help from you guys!! Money from this campaign will go towards producing this 3rd Sketchbook, hopefully full of your great pledged commissions. It will also buy me some breathing room to finish my current project \"Mute\" written by Director of \"Moon\" and other great movies, Duncan Jones. It's a brilliant project, I can't wait to  get it done and just want to finish it to the best standard I can.\nIf my goal is surpassed I will set new milestones and stretch goals based around getting me some time in the studio where I can start work for myself for the first time in my career! Constant bills and constant work for other companies under deadline has always stopped me being able to create what I want and I think this also damages the quality...I'm BIG into detail as anyone following my career would know and I've also decided I'm too old to hack stuff out any more!\nAhhhhh!...Finally I might be able to create work at a standard I will be happy with and hopefully you will be too!\nCommission and Stretch Rewards:\nAll paid for reward commissions will come first, as the major priority and will be published to Sketchbook 3. This will be printed and distributed in two shakes of a lambs tail, maybe three depending on unpredictable \"acts of God(ess)\" or environmental factors such freak tornados or the \"El Ni\u00f1o\" effect.  \nSketchbooks with requested sketches (done on the specially designated inside blank page) will come second on the to do list. Some of theses (the really unusual ones) will be scanned and published in Sketchbook 4!...yes, we forsee a Sketchbook 4!\nYour commission or sketch can include a dedication which you should also include initially.\nWe will contact you for details on your commission or sketch.\nCommissions: After your initial response to our request for details (remember, be specific about what you want) I will provide you with three thumbnails to choose from. After that you will also be allowed to make an alteration to the thumbnails before the commission will proceed.\nSketchbook Pictures: Remember to think carefully when specifying what you want as clearly as you can when we contact you. I won't be making alterations...I ain't got all day ya know!\nCommissions can be anything from a basic Batman or other popular (or unpopular) character to something fantastical invented completely from your own brain!\nTop Ten Things I've Been Asked to Draw for Money:\n1. Zombie Bob Marley on horseback impaling a dragon with a ten foot reefer.\n2. Ganesh on a skateboard.\n3. Batman kissing Superman.\n4. Fifty pictures of hands holding drumsticks.\n5. Myself committing suicide.\n6. A painting of someone's dog coming back to life.\n7. Tommy Cooper as a vicar marrying two people.\n8. Caricature of some guy for his 21st birthday with his foot on an elephant he'd killed (in fantasy) with an air rifle.\n9. Chew baca in wrestling costume.\n10. Pictures of naked women to avoid getting hit at school - not money exactly but useful all the same.\nAbout Glenn Fabry:\nI've been a comic strip artist fo over 30 years now, starting off with some stuff for the Stranglers (British Punk Rock Group), then went on to 2000AD where all the Brits in comics started at one time or another. I used to draw and paint the characters Slaine and Judge Dredd and ended up working for DC and Marvel doing mostly cover art. I'm well known for my cover work on things like Preacher and Hellblazer, picking up some some award nominations and wins along the way. I have collaborated with publisher and agents Berserker for many years taking on a varied and often bizzare range of commissions. I'm working on \"Mute\" and contemplating my future with writer and best friend Alan Mitchel as we join forces to write the greatest story ever told.

This is where real comic book magic happens.\nExperience has shown that some of the best stories out there originated from creator-owned efforts. Without a few talented and brave individuals to take the necessary risks there would be no Hellboy. No Saga. Nothing like The Walking Dead. Here is your opportunity to help add to this list of exciting titles.\nThe Broken Frontier anthology firmly puts comic creators in the driver\u2019s seat and allows them to go to exciting, uncharted territory. As such, this book is a celebration of the endless storytelling possibilities only found in comics.\nHow will the money be spent?\nThe biggest chunk of the money we\u2019re raising goes to our creators: about 60% of your pledge goes directly to the writers, artists, colorists and letterers aboard.\nOf the remaining 40%, a large chunk will go toward the print run of 1500 copies of the book, the other physical rewards, and the shipping costs and supplies needed to carefully ship everything to you, our awesome backers!\nThe remainder is used to cover the Amazon/Kickstarter fees of this campaign.\nWhy should I pledge?\nIn this anthology, our creators are given an opportunity rarely found in the comics industry: a chance to explore new, creator-owned stories and to get paid upfront for their efforts.\nYour pledge is a direct expression of your belief in the power of creator-owned comics.\nWhat is more, for every $10,000 raised above our goal, each and every creator gets a 10% increase on their page rate. So, the more successful this Kickstarter becomes, the more they get!\nA huge thank you from all of us for your support!\nWith your help, this project will be a success. Please join the Broken Frontier campaign and share it with your friends, wherever in the galaxy they may be. Thanks so much from all of us for your time, your generosity and your support.

You may know me from...well, okay, you've probably never heard of me before in your life (sorry about that), but suffice it to say that I'm a fan of \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, and if you're reading this, then maybe you are, too!  I'm looking to bring Al's 1989 movie \"UHF\" back to theaters for a one-time-only show on Sunday, May 31st, before the Mandatory Fun tour stop in Greensburg, Pennsylvania.  (NOTE: you don't have to come to the screening or even order tickets to get the rewards!)\nI'm asking for your assistance in bringing this screening to life by helping to offset some of the costs associated with licensing and rental fees in exchange for some cool rewards!  Let's hear about some of the important details for this screening, shall we?\nWhen?\nWe are looking to show the movie on Sunday, May 31st at 1:00pm.  We'll watch the film, chat, and revel in the magic that is UHF.\nWhere?\nThis screening will be held at Latrobe 30 Theatre & Cafe, an intimate, two-screen, locally-owned theater located just a few miles from Greensburg.  You can check out their website here: http://latrobe30theatre.com.  Here's a map showing the direct route from the movie theater to the Palace Theater, where Al's Mandatory Fun concert will be held later that evening (the movie will be over in plenty of time to head over to the concert):\nClick on the map to see an interactive version!\n It's a straight shot on Rt. 30!\nWhat's \"UHF\"?\nUHF is \"Weird Al\" Yankovic and director Jay Levey's 1989 sendup of the film industry.  The movie stars Yankovic, Michael Richards (\"Seinfeld\"), Fran Drescher (\"The Nanny\"), Victoria Jackson (\"Saturday Night Live\"), David Bowe (\"Transformers\"), Gedde Watanabe (\"Gung Ho\") and more, as characters George (Yankovic) and Bob (Bowe) try to save a struggling UHF station.  The movie has spoofs galore and even a full-length, in-movie music video!  Read more about it here: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098546/?ref_=nv_sr_1\nIf you're a fan of the movie (or just Weird Al in general), I hope that you'll be able to find something here that you'll enjoy.  First and perhaps most obvious, I'm offering up tickets to the show.  The movie will be shown in a very small theater, so there will be only 60 tickets to be had at this time.\nArt by Rafer Roberts\nThere are four different tickets, each featuring a different character in the film.  The tickets, selected at random, can be had in three different reward tiers:\nOne ticket\nTwo tickets\nOne ticket bundled with a bunch of the other rewards\nWhat if I'm not from the area but still want some of that cool swag?\nWell then, you are in luck!  I realize that most people who see this won't be from the Pittsburgh area, but there's still an opportunity to get the other rewards mailed directly to you.  Let's look at what else we've got!\nArt by Pietro\nScreening information will be printed on the back.  This image will also be used as the basis for the wallpaper reward, which will be available in a number of different desktop and smart phone sizes.\nArt by Randy Riggs\nYou get all six 1.25\" 8-Bit UHF buttons in one reward tier! \nWe've got three 11x17 art prints up for grabs, either separately or as a bundle.\nart by Joe Badon\nIn addition to being awesome, t-shirts will be available in men's (S-XXL) and women's (XS-XL) sizes.\nComing in at 27x40, this image is gigantic at full movie poster size!

Over the course of the series, she learns that being a guy has its own difficulties and pretending to be someone else has consequences. \nFlutter is a collaboration between Jeff McComsey and me, Jennie Wood. We published Flutter, volume one, a full color graphic novel in 2013 with indie publisher 215 Ink.\nThis year, again working with 215 Ink, we\u2019re publishing the second volume of Flutter. 215 Ink is a small press fighting the good fight. They've used all of the resources they have available to support Flutter. However, the one thing we've yet to accomplish with 215 Ink is getting enough copies of the full color graphic novels printed so that we can get them into comic shops.\nThis is where you come in. With your help, we can print enough copies of Flutter, Vol. 1 & 2 to work directly with a distributor and get them into comic shops. All of the money raised by this Kickstarter will go towards printing copies of Flutter, Vol. 1 & 2. Any money over our initial goal will go toward printing more Flutter.\nComics and graphic novels are more popular than ever. The success of mainstream books such as Young Avengers and Ms. Marvel proves that the demand for diverse storytelling is growing. Making Flutter available for anyone who needs or wants to read it is our goal. Not only will you be helping us accomplish this dream, but you\u2019ll be supporting 215 Ink, an indie press that provides a nurturing, supportive publishing home for comic artists and writers. \nThe Flutter Story So Far \nWhile the root of Flutter comes from my childhood -- growing up in a small, conservative town, thinking my life would be easier as a boy -- this project is a complete 50-50 collaboration with Jeff. \nJeff & Me at New York Comic Con, 2013\nOne of my favorite examples of how Jeff and I work together is the evolution of the character Penelope. \nPenelope was only supposed to be a minor character, but I fell in love with how Jeff drew her. Even in Jeff's early sketches, he gave Penelope so much personality that she jumped off the page. Over the course of vol. 1, Penelope developed into a major character. \nNow she's on the cover of vol. 2. \nCover of Flutter, Vol. 2: Don't Let Me Die Nervous\nSTRETCH GOAL #1 - UNLOCKED!! $10,000\nHitting our initial goal of $8,000 means that every backer receives a limited edition 28 page FUBAR mini comic featuring all three of my FUBAR stories.  Now that we've reached our first stretch goal of $10,000, that mini comic will include a brand new FUBAR story!\n\nSTRETCH GOAL #2 - $12,000\nShould we, could we, CAN we??? 36 hours to go and ONE MORE STRETCH GOAL! Can we do it? If we hit our second stretch goal, all backers will receive an exclusive, limited edition 5'X7\" FLUTTER print, art by Jeff McComsey, signed and numbered. \nRewards, Rewards, Rewards\nAlong with copies of Flutter, Vol. 1 & 2, we also have copies of other books by us as rewards, including my YA novel, A Boy Like Me, and Jeff's graphic novel, Mother Russia, tons of original art rewards, and limited edition Flutter T-shirts.\nA BOY LIKE ME Cover art by Sarah Pruski\n\nAn INDIEFAB Book of the Year finalist, A Boy Like Me is also published by 215 Ink. It's edited by Kelly Ford and 215 Ink's Editor In Chief Mike Perkins. \nCover art by Steve Becker\n\nMother Russia is a graphic novel by Jeff based on one of the first two stories that originally launched FUBAR.\nI\u2019m offering a one on one version of the graphic novel / comic writing class that I teach at Grub Street, as well as various manuscript consultations, including a novel manuscript consultation by both writer / editor Kelly Ford and me. Read more about Kelly's work here. Below are some testimonials for my classes, seminars, and consulting. \n\"Not only is Jennie Wood a talented writer, but she is also a gifted teacher. Through her examples and experience, Jennie did a fantastic job in teaching the formatting and technique of comic writing. She also provided informative feedback on my short comic script, \"The Most Beautiful Girl He'd Ever Seen,\" from improving dialogue to expanding the script in order to add to character development.\"\n- Kevin Lewis, writer  \n\"Jennie Wood's classes combine her talent, experience, marketing skills, and professionalism. I'd urge anyone who wants to further their knowledge of the graphic novel art form and create a pathway to success to take her classes. You'll be very happy you did!\" \n- Richard Salvucci, artist\n\"Jennie Wood doesn't just know how to write a great graphic novel; she knows how to teach others how to do so. That's an even rarer gift.\" \n- Leslie Lehmann, Board of Directors Friends of the Brighton Branch Library, lifelong comics enthusiast, retired teacher\n\"There's an old adage that talent is nothing without craft - meaning that no matter how much raw talent you might have, it's practically useless without an understanding of the tools and craft that you must use to *focus* that talent. Not only is Jennie Wood wildly talented in her own right, she's also a master of her craft - and one who can creatively and compassionately teach you how to be better at doing what you love.\" \n- Matt Hurd, writer & founder of Breakwater Industries\nWe also have some fun rewards if we hit our stretch goals. On behalf of 215 Ink and Jeff, I thank you for your time and support.  \n- Jennie ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWorking long distance with Jeff and 215 Ink on multiple prints runs, as well as getting all rewards signed, sketched, and shipped can be challenging, but we will get your rewards out to you ASAP!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "Last Call for Flutter, Volume Three", "update_content": "Hey,\nJust a quick last call for anyone who wants to back our current Flutter, Volume Three Kickstarter and hasn't had a chance to yet.

Hamlet, Juliet, Othello, Falstaff and Captain Cesario search for a reclusive wizard who may have the ability to assist them in their battle against the evil forces led by the villains Richard III, Lady Macbeth and Iago. That reclusive wizard? William Shakespeare.\nIn Kill Shakespeare, you and 3 of your friends will join together to free the kingdom from the clutches of the forces of Richard III. You will compete to liberate cities, remove his influence from the land and complete quests to wrest control from the vile King Richard.\nYou will use your own influence to grow your army and steal troop movement letters and city plans in order to liberate the cities that have been occupied by Richard and Lady Macbeth\u2019s forces. You must be careful, however, because not all of your companions can be trusted. You must beware that the vile Iago will steal your own plans and report your troop movements to your sworn enemies.\nThroughout the game you will be given quests by the likes of Puck, Shakespeare and other favorite characters from the pages of William Shakespeare's great plays. These quests and events will weave a deep narrative created by the writers of the Kill Shakespeare comic book that bring you even deeper into the engrossing world of the award-winning comic.\nWhile only one of the heroes can rule the day, you will need to work together to ensure that Richard doesn't overrun the realm, that Lady Macbeth doesn't ensnare your rebellion and that Iago doesn't gain the knowledge of Shakespeare\u2019s whereabouts.\nIn this world, your enemies have a single goal.

It stars Kane, Bodie (both graphic designers), and Ally (a project manager) who navigate the treacherous tedium of corporate life while trying to balance the chaos of their love lives.  It's my answer to the distinct lack of Asian American sit-coms on television, like The Office but with more swearing. In 2011, I self-published book 1, Back to the Grind: A Yellow Peril Collection, which collects the first year of strips.\nTHE BOOK\nI'm hoping to raise money to publish a print edition of book 2, The Client is Always: A Yellow Peril Collection.  The strips collected in this volume follow Kane, Bodie, and Ally as they contemplate striking out on their own as a small start-up.  Included in the book is an extensive strip commentary section with notes on specific scenes, panels, and the many local restaurants that pop up throughout the comic.\nTHE REWARDS\nEvery backer will get PDF Digiditions of books 1 and 2 because you are awesome.\nHead Sketches\nIf you choose a tier with a sketch, you can choose any of the characters listed on the cast page.  Some of them will be smiling, some of them will be grimacing, some of them may have glasses, some of them may look like Kamen Rider.  It depends on how I'm feeling and how many I have to get through.\nShirt Design\nThis is a Kitsuneruma which makes its first appearance in the comic here.\nThere are many Daruma wishing dolls that appear throughout Yellow Peril.  Traditional Daruma dolls are modeled after Bodhidharma, the first Zen Buddhist practitioner.  It is said that he meditated in a cave for so long that his limbs atrophied.  That's why Daruma dolls have no limbs.  They are usually hollow with a low center of gravity so if you knock them over, they roll back upright.\nDaruma dolls come without any eyes.  When you make a wish, you color in the right eye.  If/when your wish comes true, you color in the left eye.  Some Japanese corporations use these to motivate their employees to succeed.\nI've sort of taken the idea of the Daruma doll and come up with slight variations.  Throughout the comic, you'll see Lovarumas, Deatharumas, and Kitsunerumas.  Lovearumas are for romantic wishes.  Deatharumas are for endings, like if you want a relationship to end. Kitsunerumas are inspired by the Japanese fox spirit which is known for mischief which makes the Kitsuneruma for mischievous wishes.\nFive Deadly Venom Pickguards\nThe guitar body was instantly picked up when the project launched, so I wanted to produce some other guitar related things. I'm currently painting some Stratocaster style pickguards in the theme of the classic Shaw Brothers film, Five Deadly Venoms.  Depicted are four of the five, Toad, Snake, Lizard, and Scorpion.\nI'm posting photos on my instagram as I work on these pieces so you can follow my progress.\nGuitar With a Dragon Tattoo\nThese photos were taken before it was clear coated, but this is the top tier reward.  Note the lack of neck, pickups, bridge, tone and volume knobs, or pickup selector.  If you would like to play this beast at a show, you'll need to buy a few bits and take it to a luthier who can wire it all up for you.  Or you can just display it in your home as an art piece.\nCustomizing guitars is something I've always wanted to do so I thought this would be a really fun way to dip my toes into the waters.\nGOAL STRETCHING\n$2000 - Every backer will get a sticker! Actually, two stickers. One to stick, one to keep. ACHIEVED\n$3000 - All book orders will receive two mini prints. ACHIEVED\n$4000 - All book orders will receive a bag of five YP branded guitar picks. ACHIEVED\n$5000 - All book orders will receive a YP 11x17 poster of the cast as Super Sentai (Power Rangers).

After the success of those first two volumes I'm beyond proud to announce our third and most ambitious volume:\nFUBAR: American History Z.\nThe 32 stories that comprise FUBAR: American History Z Span the entire American experience from the discovery of the new world to the present day.\nSo replace zombie Nazis and zombie Kamikazes with zombie George Washington. Add in a helping of crazy zombie Civil War dudes, zombie Jimi Hendrix, zombie Teddy Roosevelt and you get the idea.\n\nVolume three clocks in at over 300 pages and contains the work of over 45 writers, artists, letterers, and is *just* about complete and ready to go.\nThe logistics are all locked in except for one important part and that's what brings us to Kickstarter. We're here  to ask you ladies and gents once again for a little help getting this third volume off to the  printer.

Each backer that selects any or all volumes for a reward gets their choice of ANY custom World War II or historical American zombie head sketch right on the first page of each book!\nINTERNATIONAL REWARDS\nWe've added international shipping rates to each reward to compensate for International backers.

Click to check out the webcomic!\nI will warn you ahead of time that Blast Furnace is a non-stop romp of comic joke-ology the world has never seen. Prepare yourself for horribly burned criminal owls, melted adulterous security guards, dragon bartenders, 70's turtles, lil' draculas, evil rabbit police chiefs and a Native American warrior who looks just like a horse, but actually he's just a hideously deformed man.\nOur hero, ladies and gentlemen.\n\nBlast Furnace is an improv comic. It was created a page a day, an hour per page, five days a week for six months. Every work day, I would sit down with little to no idea what was going to happen on the page, I'd start the clock, and just start making it up. An hour later, I had a finished page of the story. The only thing that I started the book with was the name of the character and approximately what he looked like. I decided to break the story into six 22 to 24 page chapters, basically one a month, so that I would have to control the story and make it have actual climaxes in the narrative.\nBehold, a giant robot business man made out of smaller robot business men.\nAs a reaction to how long it took to do each page of my other web-comic, GOD HATES ASTRONAUTS http://www.godhatesastronauts.com Blast Furnace was all about making the story as quickly as possible. I knew I had a lot of ideas that I wanted to get down on paper, so this was my way of making it happen faster and with more energy. I decided to put it online as a page a day web-comic, so that people could click on the site, say every Friday, and there would be five pages waiting there for them to read. You can read all of Blast Furnace recreational thief for free online at http://www.blastfurnacecomic.com to check out what the book is all about. BUT the real goal is to read it in print. I've done a very limited printing that I have been selling at comic shows locally, but I'd love to fund a printing large enough that everyone can get their own copy.\n144 Pages of improv comic goodness!\nThe Blast Furnace MUSTACHE SHIRT!\nBlast Furnace is truly a labor of love for me. Possibly the most fun I've ever had making a comic and I'm excited to have you along to be a part of getting this book out into the world. If all goes well, I'll see you all again for \"Blast Furnace Two: The Search For More Money\".\nThanks everyone!!!\n-Ryan Browne\nBLAST FURNACE TESTIMONIALS:\nChris Burnham (Batman Inc., Officer Downe) says\u2026\n\"By flipping through this comic, you run the risk of spoiling any number of indescribable and unforgettable surprises that await within. Just buy it. If you don't like it, feel free to re-gift it to one of your cool friends. They'll LOVE it.\"\nZander Cannon (Top Ten, Replacement God) says\u2026\n\"There are a couple sections in your brain where you should just close the door and turn off the lights before sitting down to a helping of Blast Furnace. In fact, most of them; when the only section left is the one populated by talking ostriches, guys with flaming ties and electro-staches, deformed horse men, ghost owls with peculiar sexual appetites, touching interspecies friendships and subsequent betrayals, and robot businessmen made out of several smaller robot businessmen, you know you're all set for a good read. Oh, but then, quick, set that part of your brain on fire. It helps.\"\nB. Clay Moore (Hawaiian Dick, Battle Hymn) says\u2026\n\"Blast Furnace is pure stream-of-consciousness comics, featuring one of the most inventive imaginations in the biz (we call it \"the biz\") running wild at 200 miles per hour. It's probably the greatest story featuring robot businessmen built out of other robot businessmen that I've ever read. Also? Triple flashbacks! Owls and bears! Dragon bartenders! Turtles with afros!

However, we've set a new goal now with the time remaining. We've also added a new reward! \nOn December 28, at the Black Cat in Washington, DC we'll be hosting an event to end all events! DC punk legends Dag Nasty (original line-up), Government Issue, Black Market Baby and Kingface will all play together to celebrate the filming of \"Salad Days.\" See below for a limited set of tickets! \nRemember, every dollar that is pledged beyond this point will go towards making \"Salad Days\" the best possible film it can be\u2014it's a subject we're passionate about and we know you are, too! \nThank you, really.\nScott Crawford\nJim Saah\nABOUT THE MOVIE\nSALAD DAYS  is a documentary-in-progress that examines the fertile Washington, DC punk scene of the 1980s. This was a particularly important time in the evolution of punk and independent music, with DC based bands like Minor Threat, Bad Brains, Black Market Baby, the Faith, the Slickee Boys, Void, Government Issue, Marginal Man, Dag Nasty, 9353, Gray Matter, Beefeater, Scream, Rites of Spring, Fugazi, Shudder to Think, Nation of Ulysses, Jawbox and others defining the DC aesthetic. Local record labels like Dischord, Fountain of Youth, Teen Beat, and Simple Machines would become standard-bearers for the DIY revolution. \n\nWHY NOW\nMuch has been written about the pre-Nirvana period of American punk\nrock, but there's never been an examination of DC's \ncontribution. We've spent the last year interviewing dozens of\nthe participants who helped create the local music scene in the 1980s\u2014 musicians, photographers, DJs, activists, and writers\u2014to tell the story of one of the most inspiring (and misunderstood) decades in independent music. We've also sorted through hundreds of photos, live videos, flyers and zines for inclusion in the film.\nLike countless others, I discovered punk rock as a kid. Growing up in the Washington, DC area I was so taken with what I was witnessing that I started a fanzine and began to document the local scene. Almost 30 years later, I wanted to revisit the people and places that have informed my life and so many others. It's been a hell of a journey so far\u2014but we're not done yet.\nWHY WE NEED YOUR HELP\nAs we finish up the pre-production phase, we need your help. Your donations will offset the upcoming costs of editing, animation, graphics, mastering, color correction, sound editing, travel and more. We have a daunting task ahead of us\u2014and yet we\u2019re so passionate about telling this story that we\u2019re anxious to share it with the world as soon as we can. We hope SALAD DAYS will see a Q3 2013 release and we have high hopes for its festival run. Thanks in advance for your support\u2014we can\u2019t do it without you!\nWith Ian MacKaye during his interview for SALAD DAYS.\nWith Dave Grohl during the filming of SALAD DAYS\nWHO WE ARE\nAn August 1985 Washington City Paper article on Crawford entitled \"Punktrepeneur\"...\nSALAD DAYS Director/writer SCOTT CRAWFORD is a music journalist, musician and graphic designer. As a teenager in the DC suburbs, he started a fanzine called Metrozine that documented much of what was happening in the DC hardcore punk scene in the 1980s. In 1985, Metrozine (and WGNS) released a 7\" compilation called \"Alive & Kicking\" that featured unreleased tracks by DC area bands Gray Matter, United Mutation, Marginal Man, Beefeater, Cereal Killer and Mission Impossible (featuring a 16 year old Dave Grohl). He was quoted in both Dance of Days and Banned in DC\u2014the two most definitive books on the early DC punk scene. In 2001, he launched Harp magazine and served as its Editor-in-Chief for over 7 years. Crawford also launched the online music portal Blurt (blurt-online.com) in 2009.\nServing as Director of Photography for SALAD DAYS, Jim Saah (jimsaah.com) is a native of Washington, DC who has worked professionally in photography and video for over 25 years. He has shot for a variety of publications and websites ranging from the Washington Post to Rolling Stone.\nHe's also an experienced videographer whose credits range from union organizing films to music documentaries. Recent films he has worked on include movies about the bands Wilco, Death Cab for Cutie and Eddie Vedder.\nHOW KICKSTARTER WORKS\nKickstarter is an amazing funding platform for creative projects like ours. However, it's an all or nothing process\u2014if we don't reach our goal, we lose EVERYTHING. We've given ourselves 30 days to fund this project. Please help us in any way you can. We have something for everyone\u2014regardless of how much you give. \nCAN WE EXCEED OUR GOAL?\nAbsolutely! Every penny we receive is going towards making the best film we can possibly make. Therefore, anything we can make beyond or goal can be put towards covering all of the many unexpected costs that will no doubt occur along the way. \nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!\nScott Crawford\nDirector/writer SALAD DAYS\nFOLLOW OUR PROGRESS:\nSALAD DAYS on Twitter\nSALAD DAYS on Facebook\nInterviews include:\nIan MacKaye (Minor Threat, Embrace, Fugazi, Evens, Dischord)\nHenry Rollins (SOA, Black Flag, Rollins Band)\nDave Grohl (Scream, Nirvana, Foo FIghters)\nJohn Stabb (Government Issue)\nPete & Franz Stahl (Scream, Wool)\nHR (Bad Brains)\nJoe Lally (Fugazi)\nKenny Inouye (Marginal Man)\nDante Ferrando (Iron Cross, Gray Matter, Ignition)\nJeff Nelson (Minor Threat, 3, Dischord)\nMary Timony (Helium, Wild Flag)\nAlec MacKaye (the Faith, Ignition, the Warmers)\nFred Armisen (SNL, Portlandia)\nDave Smalley (DYS, Dag Nasty, All, Down By Law)\nSteve Niles (Gray Matter, 3)\nMonica Richards (Strange Boutique)\nBruce Miles Hellington (9353)\nJon Wurster (Superchunk, Mountain Goats)\nJenny Toomey (Tsunami, Simple Machines) \nBoyd Farrell (Black Market Baby)\nBobby Sullivan (Soulside)\nJason Farrell (Swiz, Bluetip, Retisonic)\nJ.

I can't wait to see how it turns out.", "time": "over 8 years ago"}]}}, {"backer": "Oliver Mertz", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "The Model\nPeople don't like advertising almost as a general rule; Advertising is simply The Way It Is. People who make content learn to like it, because they want to make content, and they also want to eat food and sleep under a roof, and the opportunity to do both at the same time seems like a pretty good idea. \nAfter the \"dot com bubble,\" we ran the site entirely on donations for over a year. The word crowdfunding hadn't been invented yet; back then, people simply called it \"begging,\" but I think it's clear that those days are long past. We look back on that period with incredible fondness, and I don't think we're the only ones. It was just two of us then, not the juggernaut that it is now; we have mouths to feed, as it were. I think we had assumed it wasn't possible to do it that way anymore - to operate a site at this scale without advertising dollars - but it occurred to us that we'd never actually asked. People often want to know how they can support the site in a way that doesn't involve t-shirts or looking at advertising, and I think we may have a way. What I'm saying is that we want to sell out, and we would love to sell out to you. \nHow Do You Intend To Do That\nBy doing this. \nLeaderboard Ad Removed, $250k Goal\nThat's for the amount you see on the right. If it turns out to be something people want to see, or not see as the case may be, we'll add stretch goals to restore old services we used to offer, convert the entire site to a Creative Commons license, and ultimately remove every ad from the site for an entire year. We intend to be a company that succeeds by making things, specifically things for you, and are orienting ourselves toward that goal. \nAll ads on homepage removed. $525k goal\nSo, we're turning to you. Would scouring ads from Penny Arcade, with everything that entails, be something you\u2019d be willing to reach into your pocket for? The more we considered it, the more we agreed it might just be. Not only would you no longer have to look at advertising when browsing Penny Arcade, but not having ads would create a chain reaction that would lead to a bunch of other interesting stuff. Without the almighty \"pageview\" to consider, why not populate the RSS with full comics and posts? Why not enable and even encourage apps, first and third party, for people to read it however they damn well please?\nThat seems pretty compelling to us, but in keeping with Kickstarter tradition we\u2019ve greased the wheels with a buffet of backer rewards and stretch goals. This is an amazing experiment in our opinion. If it doesn\u2019t work Penny Arcade will be fine. We\u2019ll keep going just like before with no interruption in service and nothing will change. But if it did work, I mean, wow.\n\nThat would be something. \nStretchgoals:\nUpdate #1: $550k Stretchgoal\nOne of the things that excited us most about the idea of trying an ad-free model was the amount of time it would give us to actually make comics. Currently, we do all kinds of creative services projects that are part of the existing model, but in their absence, that's all time we can put to work for you. We have a ton of weird settings, and ideas for more, that are simply not possible with the schedule the current system imposes. What we're talking about would be new projects, in settings you already like, that run ALONGSIDE the week's comics, not in their place. Like, oh, I don't know... THIS?!?\nWe have quite a year planned, if you're game.\nCW(TB)\n-----\nUpdate #2: $325k Stretchgoal\nAdditional Revelations! \nWe're just revealing things right and left around here. It would be our great pleasure to acquaint you with Automata: Silverside in lieu of our typical \"creative services\" work. The first of these projects unlocks at $325,000, and we're chomping at the bit. Or champing at it; I can never remember if you chomp or champ. In any case, there won't be anything left of this bit by the time we're done. We're going crazy on it!\n(CW)TB\n-----\nUpdate #4: Penny Arcade Leaderboard Stretch Goal Unlocked! Stretchgoals up to $999k revealed.\nIt's unbelievable, but the campaign has reached our first funding goal of $250k in four days. We've been blown away by the support thus far, and the interest from people outside the industry makes us think we might be on to something here.\nAs promised, we are revealing the stretch goals up to $999k ... behold! (check out the updated list up top!) The new goals we've revealed are:  \nJerry Cosplay: Jerry has agreed to Cosplay as the character of the community's choice (by vote) for one day at both PAX East 2013 and PAX Prime 2013. \nStrip Search Web Show: Discussed in a flurry of tweets, Penny Arcade: The Series Season 4 will be our version of America's Next Top Webcomic titled... STRIP SEARCH. This incredibly ambitious and expensive production will bring together over 10 up and coming webcomic hopefuls for a week of grueling challenges and horrifying social experiments, hosted by Mike and Jerry. For what? A considerable cash prize and integration into the Penny Arcade offices for one year. \nTwisp & Catsby Children's Book (free online): Mike and Jerry will create and publish online (for free) a Twisp & Catsby Children's Book. \nOriginal Tabletop Adventure: Mike and Jerry will write a completely original tabletop adventure, not tied to any particular system, to be released for free. \nFree PA Comic Reader developed for iOS and Android \nPA Blanks/Creative Common License: We will release, with each Monday, Wednesday and Friday strip, a blank version of the comic (art without word balloons) for your editing and remixing enjoyment. In addition, we will open the ENTIRE PA archive to a Creative Common License under CC BY-NC-SA. \n-----\nUpdate #5: Automata Project Unlocked, More Lookouts Info, Comic Sketch Reward and Additional Q&As!\nWe\u2019ve just crossed the $325,000 mark, meaning the Automata strip for 2013 is LOCKED IN. As a teaser, Mike created this image to give you an idea of what\u2019s in in store:\nOur next goal is to make Jerry cosplay as whatever you want him to, which for those in the office is VERY EXCITING. If that goal is met, we\u2019ll first open submissions via an online survey, and then select the top 5 choices by raw #s. From there, we\u2019ll have another online vote-off.\n\nLooking down a bit further on the stretch goal list, Jerry also wrote this piece to go along with a new sketch by Mike for the Lookouts, Daughters of Eyrewood:\n\ndaughter, daughter,\nkilled her father\nlook at what her\nblood has bought her \nNew Reward - Original Comic Pencil Sketch\nThis isn\u2019t a reward you\u2019ll find on the right side but is actually one that applies to ANYONE that contributes more than $2,500. You will receive in the mail, one of the original pencil sketches from the Penny Arcade archives (and for those donating $5k, you\u2019ll receive two, and so on). \nThese sketches are what are scanned in and digitally inked, so each online strip has ONE pencil sketch associated with it. These are the ORIGINALS. (please note, the strip you receive will be at random) Since Mike no longer does the pencil sketches ahead of time, this part in the process no longer exists making these extra rare.\nWe've also updated the FAQ with some additional questions. Please check them out below!\n-----\nUpdate #6: $350k reached, new rewards added!\nWe crossed the $350,000 mark over the weekend, so it looks like this thing has some legs. After listening to a ton of feedback, we have a few more rewards that may interest you!\n\nPrecipice Promotional 1 GB Flash Drives - $250 (30 available)\nWhen we made Precipice of Darkness, Episode 1, we had manufactured 50 USB Credit Card drives (seen here) for media kits, etc. With this reward level you\u2019ll receive this Flash Drive in the mail filled with the digital versions of Books 1 and 2 and the remastered Jerry tracks! We have two versions of the drive (Gabe and Tycho) \u2013 which you receive will be picked at random. Add $10 for International addresses.\n1 lb of Jerry\u2019s Coffee Roast - $300 (10 available)\nJerry will ship to you a one pound bag of his signature coffee beans that he roasts himself. Add $10 for International addresses.\n\nLogo Design by PA Design - $1500 (10 available)\nGive Kiko and Erika the name of your company and a synopsis of what exactly it is you do, and delivered to you will be the one-colour AI/PDF/PSD files for your further manipulation. This is the team that designed the PAX Logo, the Trenches Logo, the Child\u2019s Play logo, etc.\n\nBrew with Jerry - $2500 (4 available)\nIt\u2019s no secret Jerry loves brewing, and this reward gives you the opportunity to brew with Jerry in Seattle. You only need to handle your transportation, and Jerry will take care of the rest. Must be 21 or older.\n\nPing Pong. Your Team vs. Team Inferno - $5000 (1 available)\nInvite you and up to 9 of your friends for an officially sanctioned match against Team Inferno in Seattle, WA. The most expensive pizza you have ever purchased will be included. You just need to handle transportation.\n\nPA will crash your birthday party - $5000 (1 available)\nMike and Jerry and possibly some other people will crash your party and totally eat all of your food and drink everything in your fridge. Must be in the Seattle area.\n\nKhoo will plan your bachelor party - $7500 (1 available)\nThis is for planning and day-of execution only. Robert Khoo will take whatever your pre-determined budget is and plan a\u2026 uh\u2026 experience for you and your friends. A more detailed description to this reward would be against the code. See PA:TS S02E28 for reference.\n\nMike and Jerry DM - $8000 (1 available)\nMike and Jerry will be your DM for you and 3 of your friends, running an adventure just for you. You just need to handle transportation to Seattle.\nWe\u2019ve also been getting some really interesting ideas for stretchgoals from readers \u2013 if you want to suggest some before we announce our next set of them, send an email to ks@penny-arcade.com. Thanks!\n-----\nUpdate #8: The Final Cosplay Vote + More details on Strip Search\n(Note: Skipped #7 since it was just the initial cosplay vote)\nWe've crossed the $375k mark, meaning Jerry is on the hook for cosplaying as the character of your choice. We did open submissions in Update #7, and after over 15,000 suggestions, here are the top 5 to vote on:\n\n1. Bayonetta\n2. Sailor Moon\n3. The Fruit Fucker\n4. Tycho\n5. Yummy Chan\n\nHonorable mentions go to Strawberry Shortcake and Lollipop Chainsaw. ;)\n\nAlright, vote here!\n\nGabe also just posted an update on Penny Arcade about Strip Search, but you can read it here as well:\n\nI admit to being a huge fan of reality tv style game shows. I love shows like So You Think You Can Dance, Hell\u2019s Kitchen, and Master Chef. I even watch shows like Ink Master and Shear Genius. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s singers, chefs, fashion designers or gardeners. I love watching groups of people pushed together to compete at something they are good at. I don\u2019t know a thing about cooking or dancing but I can\u2019t get enough of these game shows. I\u2019m always amazed when the challenge is something like \u201cmake a fruit tart\u201d and one guy says \u201cshit I\u2019ve never made a fruit tart before\u201d and then he proceeds to make a fucking fruit tart. I could never do that and maybe that\u2019s why I love watching it so much. Could you pull a theme out of a hat and then write and draw a comic strip about it? Probably not, but I\u2019m guessing you might like to watch people who can.\n\nThat\u2019s the idea for our new show Strip Search. It is the next goal in our Kickstarter and It is a reality game show for web cartoonists. Like any of these other shows I mentioned it is about watching incredibly talented people face off in a competition with a reward that could change their life.\nIn the case of Strip Search we are talking about ten people. Each one of them a talented cartoonist. They will all live together in a house here in Seattle. They will compete in a series of challenges that will test their skills and we will slowly whittle them down until we are left with one winner. This cartoonist will win a cash prize along with integration into the Penny Arcade machine. That means a studio in our office but it also means access to our business people, our merchandising operation, our designers, and our ping pong table. The winner will get plugged into the Penny Arcade family for one year. We will not own any of their work, and there will be no evil contract to sign. We will just be there to support them and help grow their comic in a way that very few other organizations could.\n\nTycho and I will be the hosts and participate in the judging but we won\u2019t be alone. We are very lucky to have friends in every corner of the industry from syndicated newspaper comics to book publishers, and web comic pioneers. We\u2019ll be bringing these folks in as guest judges and mentors throughout the competition. You\u2019ll also see everyone here in the office working with these contestants. It\u2019s a huge undertaking for us but incredibly exciting I think.\nThere is something magical about watching a comic strip come together. I think Strip Search is a show that could appeal to a much bigger audience than anything we\u2019ve done before on PATV. So if you could help us get the word out I\u2019d appreciate it. Tell your friends who like reality TV and tell them to tell their friends. I\u2019d love to see Strip Search get funded and if it does we are very close to the goal of all ads removed from the home page and our Daughters of the Eyrewood Lookouts comic.\n------\nUpdate #9: More Lookouts Art, a New Reward, FAQ Update, Jerry Cosplay\nWith 15 days left, we've raised almost $400,000, which is nearly a half-a-million dollars, which is basically a million! Right? Or...? Listen. We don't have time to thrill you with our incredible mathematics right now. It's time to reveal the terrifying revelations of Kickstarter Update 9!\n\nMore Lookouts!\n\nGabe drew more concept art for Daughters of the Eyrewood to further entice you:\nI know this level seems out there, but we still have 15 days! We are also adding another reward level at $50 for a hi-resolution, 8.5\u201d x 11\u201d print of the above Lookouts image sent to your door. Please add $5 for international addresses. (this level also includes all previous rewards!)\n\nJerry Cosplay Poll Results!\nI'll be honest, I'm actually a little shocked at the result. The winner is... the Fruit Fucker? I just feel like... that doesn't have a lot of shame-factor to it. This was an opportunity to really get some ridiculous photos of Jerry, and the community chose the Fruit Fucker? All right, we'll try to do something with it that will maximize embarrassment.\n\nOh! And I forgot to mention in the last update with honorable mentions that we also got a lot of Dr. Bunsen Honeydew suggestions, which would have also been really funny.\n----\nUpdate #10: Kickstarter Shirt Revealed!\nWe\u2019re less than $40k away from hitting our Strip Search stretchgoal, and we figured you would want to see the Exclusive Kickstarter T-Shirt commemorating the campaign! \nThis is at the $150 reward level and also includes The Dickstarter Print, Digital Versions of Books 1 and 2, Remastered Digital Singles of Jerry\u2019s PA musical works, an 8.5\u201d x 11\u201d print of the Lookouts image from Update #9, a copy of Rainslick 3, names for your band AND your pet by Jerry, thoughts of you during coitus from Mike, and of course, the glue that holds this whole campaign together, Mike chasing a duck around while he shouts your name.\n----\nUpdate #11: Strip Search UNLOCKED! Call for entries begins NOW.\nWe\u2019ve just hit the $450k/Strip Search stretchgoal! We move fast, so it\u2019s time to get the process rolling. May I present to you, the initial call for entries.\n\nAs mentioned in previous updates, the winner will get office space (for free!) at Penny Arcade HQ in Seattle, WA AND access to all of our facilities and resources (Mike, Jerry, Biz Guys, Merch Guys, etc) for one year on top of a $15,000 cash prize.\n\nThe deadline to submit is midnight, 8/24/2012 (TWO WEEKS FROM NOW). What you\u2019re applying for is to be on our new reality show, Strip Search, later this year. The process to get to our final participants will be incredibly thorough, so please know this is only the first of many steps.\n\nSome quick notes on the show:\n\nThere will be no cost to you, other than your time.\nYou will be asked to sign a video release.\nYou will be asked to sign an NDA.\nYou will NOT be asked to sign anything regarding the rights to your existing or future works.\nYou need to be 18 or older and legally be able to enter the United States.\nYou will need to take about two weeks of your life later this year for this and this alone.\nIf there are any other questions, please ask them below, and I'll get them answered.

In all of these cities new screen based sign systems are putting TV-style advertising into the public domain. These electronic signs are re-shaping urban environments and re-defining areas of public space by intensifying the commercialization of the public sphere. In addition to the explosion of screens in public spaces, screens are ubiquitous in workspaces and in our daily life activities. These seamless, illuminated electronic surfaces are becoming the devices through which we frame our experiences. ELECTRIC SIGNS explores this new screen culture as it unfolds in the global city.\nWHY DONATE?\nELECTRIC SIGNS explores vital issues related to our urban environments and the visual and media cultures that shape today's global cities. This film is created for the educational market, so by contributing to this film you will be helping to spark awareness and discussion in the fields of media studies, visual culture, and urban design and policy.\nHOW THE FUNDS WILL BE USED\nThe 6,000 dollars we hope to raise through this Kickstarter campaign will be used to hire a sound editor, a music composer (Genji Siraisi) and a voice over artist. Thanks for your help in getting this film seen on screens around the world.\nFor more information go to: www.a2studio.org/eSigns.html or email me: alice@a2studio.org.\nHOW KICKSTARTER WORKS\nKickstarter is an innovative online platform to help fund creative projects. It's an all-or-nothing funding method where we either reach our goal and get all the funds or don't reach our goal and get none of them. In other words, if we don\u2019t raise $6,000, we lose everything. Once we reach our goal, we'll be in touch to get your address so we can send you your reward.\nHOW TO PLEDGE\nJust click the green \u201cBack This Project\u201d button in the upper right-hand corner. You will be asked to input your pledge amount and select a reward. From there, you will go through the Amazon checkout process. You must finish the Amazon checkout process for your pledge to be recorded.

The Fictory has logged hundreds of hours in pursuit of finishing this project. We\u2019re close, but we can\u2019t finish this project with out YOU!Our modest goal is to reach $12,000. Not a lot by animation budget standards but it\u2019s just enough for us to wrangle in the last batch of work needed to complete the project.\nWATCH THE TRAILER\nThe Fictory is an independent animation studio comprised entirely of life long story tellers, artist and other miscreants. Over the years our group has created all sorts of entertainment content specializing in independent  comics, games, film and animation. Atomic Robo: Last Stop is our most ambitious project yet.\nI ran into Scott Wegener at a comic book convention right as The Fictory was in search of a new animation project to take on. Robo seemed a natural fit for animation and after we worked  out the details production got under way.\nSoon after production began at The Fictory. Late August of 2010 the Atomic Robo: Last Stop Teaser Trailer was released. The studio was energized and ready to charge forward. Unfortunately/fortunately for the Staff our creative endeavors were beginning to get noticed. Before long we found ourselves busier and busier. Up to this point our schedules allowed us to band together one day a week and volunteer our skills for the good of the  project.\nAs time marched on, we found ourselves buried in work and unable to devote the time Atomic Robo needed and deserved. Neglected, Robo faded quietly into the background biding his time.\nUntil now.\nWe\u2019ve sunk countless hours into this project already. Recently we\u2019ve developed a new found urgency and sense of responsibility to complete and share the animation with the Atomic Robo community.\nSo we acted on our collective gut, dug in and finished some new shots for an all new Trailer! We\u2019re locked and loaded, we just need a little help from the community to bring Robo to the screen. That\u2019s where you come in.\nATOMIC ROBO: Last Stop facebook page: Lots of production art and general project info.\nATOMIC ROBO: Last Stop animation blog: Even more production art and animation info.\nHere\u2019s closer look at some of our pledge awards!THE OFFICIAL ATOMIC ROBO PRINT\nNab the official print of Atomic Robo: Last Stop.

This is a limited reward and my personal favorite.\n\nSPEAKING ENGAGEMENTS AND WORKSHOPS\nHere are two reward types that we\u2019ve geared towards educators.\n\nSpeaking Engagement Reward\nAs well as being founder of The Fictory I am also an adjunct professor at Pennsylvania College of Art and Design where I\u2019m very comfortable with the classroom setting. For this pledge reward I\u2019m available to come in to any animation/art department and talk about what goes into producing Independent animations. Main topics include running a staff of talented artists and designers with a heavy emphasis on how one goes from a student to a professional in a constantly evolving job market. Any questions on specifics and logistics, send them to info@thefictory.comIndependent  Animation Crash Course Reward\nIn addition to the offering speaking engagements I am also available for workshops style engagements. The idea is to offer curriculums a crash course in how The Fictory executes a project. At The Fictory one of our biggest axioms is doing more with less.\nIn other words, how to organize a small group of dedicated artists into a studio capable of producing quality animation to rival a studio twice its size. To that end there will be a heavy emphasis on getting the most out of a small team of artists. This workshop would put students together to produce a small animated project. Instead of the individual producing a short piece alone the emphasis is on distribution of talent, working out group dynamics and pooling creative resources to accomplish goals. For specifics and logistics, send inquiries to info@thefictory.com\nCAMPAIGN ACHIEVEMENTS/UNLOCKABLE PLEDGE REWARDS\nOver the Hump -  Reach $6001\nReward - UNLOCKED!

It is created entirely by over 140 women of all experience levels, including top industry professionals such as:\nBarbara Kesel (Writer/Editor Marvel, DC, Crossgen, Image, Dark Horse)\nGail Simone ( DC writer, Wonder Woman, Birds of Prey, Secret Six)\nAnnie Nocenti ( Marvel writer, Dardevil, Editor for Uncanny X-Men, New Mutants)\nMing Doyle ( Boom, Image, Marvel artist)\nDevin Grayson (DC writer; Batman, Nightwing, New Titans)\nLauren Montgomery (Director & Storyboard Artist - Justice League, DC)\nFiona Staples (DC, Wildstorm, IDW , Vertigo artist)\nJune Brigman  (Creator; Brenda Starr, Power Pack)\nSamantha Newark (Voice of JEM, Singer/Vocals - God of War, Hook)\nBonnie Burton( Grrl.com)\nMany, many more! See Full List of Contributors HERE\nClick the pic to check out some amazing artwork from our contributors!\nThe purpose of the book is to show support for female creators in comics and media. There will be multiple short stories, \"how to\"s & interviews with professionals, and features showcasing iconic female comic creators that have passed, such as Nell Brinkley and Tarpe Mills. A Kids & Teens section will also be included, showcasing their work, and offering tips & tricks to help them prepare themselves for their future careers in comics. Overall, this is pretty much a huge book showcasing what women in comics have accomplished, and what we are capable of :) We are also hoping that by doing this book, it will encourage a new generation of women to pick up the pencil and create!\nPart of what's special about Womanthology is its equal opportunity aspects. Big- name professionals like Gail Simone are paired up with new and upcoming talent to promote opportunity and chances for those newcomers to learn, and give them a stage to show what they can do. For instance, Gail will be paired up with extraordinary new artist Jean Kang! Or for, another example, legendary artist Camilla d'Errico will be paired up with up and coming writer Raven Moore! Check out the Womanthology site for more exciting team ups!\nHow do we plan to do this?\nThe book is currently in production. There is a tentative release date for Womanthology of December 7th, 2011, which may change. We will keep everyone updated as things develop. Please check the FAQS for notes on rewards and when they will be sent! :) Please watch for unlocked rewards that will include a special password to a place where you can preview the works from the many talents of Womanthology!\nWhat is the money for?\nThe current Kickstarter goal amount would help us print a small run (1500) of books. This will be a 300 page, 9x12, hardcover, full-color book. All money earned goes directly to printing costs and other fees such as postage/production of rewards.\nOur current goal is $25,000. If we, by some miracle, make OVER that goal we have some very special plans! Please see the FAQS below for more information!\n\nWhy should I pledge for this project?\nWomanthology is the first of its kind. Never before have women in comics & media come together in such a huge way to create something like this. Never before has there been a publisher willing to give so many people a chance. By pledging, you are helping to create a piece of history itself, and being there to support a massive, positive movement of people into the right direction.\nThank you so much if you even considered helping! It's very much appreciated by all of us!\n... You mentioned special unlocked rewards?\nWell fine sir/miss, I sure did! The closer we get to our goal, and the more special rewards taken up, the more I can offer!

Into the Woods is about a girl's journey through childhood and her experiences to becoming a woman, and triumphing in the end.

There are so few left who are in need of their book still, that I feel it best that I update you individually from now on through email. :)\nCharity...\nWomanthology has been an incredible experience. When I launched it last year, half expecting failure, I had no idea the huge amount of happiness, difficulty, stress, and joy I would experience, or the sheer amount of positivity it would create. Being my first Kickstarter (one that was overly successful) I was caught unprepared by the huge amount of work required to take care of it all. That as well as my months of illness, created a few months of delays, which I wish more than anything could have been avoided. Despite that, I hope most of you are pleased with the final product, and are overall satisfied with the level of dedication I've tried  to give to this project and all it's backers.

In return for your hard earned money, we offer graphic novels, custom artwork, zombie shooting targets AND our unwavering gratitude.\nHello! My name is Jeff McComsey and I\u2019m the editor in chief of the World War II zombie anthology called FUBAR.\nThis anthology chronicles a zombie outbreak right in the middle of World War II, just prior to the d-day invasion. Originally FUBAR started out as a small side project of mine and like side projects tend to do, it took on a life of its own and then took over mine.\nWe released our first 188 page volume last year Entitled FUBAR: European theater of the Damned. We set the 15 stories of volume one in the European theater of WWII. Classic zombie Nazi smashing fun for the whole family in that volume.\nThe 20 stories that comprise FUBAR volume 2: Empire of the Rising Dead all take place exclusively in the Pacific theater of World War II.  Replace zombie Nazis with Zombie Kamikazes and add in a helping of crazy zombie Jarheads and you get the idea.\nBoth volumes are stand alone and don't need to be read in order so choose whichever volume strikes your World War II zombie smashing fancy... OR you could get both.\nFUBAR VOLUME 1 PREVIEW!\nFUBAR VOLUME 2 PREVIEW!\nVolume 2 clocks in at 194 pages and contains the work of over 35 writers, artists, letterers, and is 100% complete and ready to go.\nThe logistics are all locked in except for one important part. We're here  to ask you ladies and gents for a little help getting this second volume off to the  printer.\n If funding is successful we intend to use the money exclusively for the offset print run of FUBAR Volume 2: Empire of the rising Dead.  \n CUSTOM SKETCHES!\nThere's a lot of the custom art and sketching we only ever get to do at conventions and signings like: our choose your own historical/fictitious WW II character and we draw them in the front page square of your newly purchased book sketch.  We're very excited about sharing these type of pledge rewards with any supporters who purchase Volume 1 or Volume 2.\nAND ZOMBIE SHOOTING TARGETS?\nBelow you will find links to examples of some of our pledge rewards including a gallery of Steve Becker's Zombie Combat targets that you get to choose from for those specific rewards featuring an 11x17 print. You will also find links to view some of the custom zombie sketches we do in the front pages of both Volume 1 and 2. We've also included links to the zombie portraits and the Medal of Honor portrait so you guys get a better idea of what we mean in the pledge rewards.\nZOMBIE COMBAT TARGETS\nCUSTOM FRONT SKETCHES\nZOMBIE PORTRAITS\nMEDAL OF HONOR PORTRAITS\nSIX PANEL CINEMA\nYou guys are awesome...\nIn the comics community there's always talk about whether or not the medium's day has come and gone. Looking around at the caliber of new creators and projects In the Small-Press community alone as well as remarkable outlets like Kickstarter, We feel like there's never been a better time to make comics.\n This series contains inspired work by over three dozen writers, artists, letterers and is to date the project of which I am most proud to have been a part of.  Your support of Indie comics in general and FUBAR in particular makes it possible for these project to exist and thrive. I know I can speak for all the creators involved when I say thank you.

I've always been behind the scenes but i've never had a chance to do something of my own. \nNow I'm asking my fans to support me upfront so that i can make a cartoon. they have been waiting for this since Adult Swim and mc chris came into existence in 2001. The production will be split into three segments of five minutes, each for 50,000 dollars. So it will be a long haul before we're done, but if we all put some effort into it then maybe we can see something by Christmas. The schedule will become clear as we start to get our hands dirty.\nI will be keeping the backers more than informed while we're in production. There will be a website this summer detailing each phase with all the stuff i would have liked to have seen when i was young animation geek: blogs, clips, and videos about the process. \nTitmouse will be making the cartoon. They make all the shows you love on Adult Swim: Venture Brothers, Super Jail, Metalocalypse. I've gone after the best of the best in my opinion and i'm confident they will deliver a top rate toon.\nI will be busy fundraising and planning the second episode as well as finishing and promoting race wars this fall, communicating on the road with Titmouse via skype. :) There will be lots to do but like I said this dream will come true if we put the effort in.\nThanks again to all the loyal fans that have been waiting for this specific opportunity to help support an mc chris cartoon. we've all been waiting for this and now it's up to us to make it a reality.

We had recorded songs a year earlier, but we were still feeling our way around our sound at that time.\nIn January, we sat down and looked at albums that inspired us: Ziggy Stardust, London Calling, Bruce Springsteen's Nebraska. All albums worked well as a whole and carried a distinct feeling throughout their entirety. This is what we strove to do with our debut.\nWe made a list of all our songs, and eventually whittled it down to nine tracks that played well off each other, shared similar moods and spoke to the listener on an emotional level.\nBeing fairly handy people, and blessed to have talented friends, we took a DIY approach to recording. Jim Orr did the heavy lifting in his home studio; the rest of it was recorded in our homes using protools. To accomplish this, spouses often helped out with kid duties and babysitting to free up other members of the band.\nAs of now, we're happy to say the album is completely recorded - done on a shoestring budget without sacrificing any quality. But this is where we need your help.\nWe were planning on mixing ourselves, but Michael, the guitarist, called up his brother-in-law, Scott Greiner, a professional sound engineer who has worked with Liz Phair and most recently, The Posies. With a nice brother-in-law discount, Scott agreed to produce and mix our album.\nAt the same time, Michael's work offered to shoot a professional music video for the band while only charging for basic costs, food and some beverages. This is what adds up to our $2,000 goal - helping to cover some of Scott's costs, mastering, CD production and shooting the video.\nAny donation you can make to our cause is greatly appreciated. We're offering some great gifts for those kind people who donate, and we've tried to keep our main offerings at the $25 and below line, as we all understand how tight extra funds can be. And if by the grace of good fortune we exceed our $2,000 goal by double, we'll be able to do something extra cool - numbered vinyl records to all who donated $15 or more!\nThanks for checking out our pitch and visiting kickstarter.\nSincerely,\nThe Black Marks", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #6", "update_userinfo": "The Video Is Done!", "update_content": "Hey everyone!\n\nThank you so much for your contributions.

We're Vantage Point Productions, the crew behind Season 2 of Penny Arcade: The Series.\nAfter the huge fan response to the PA:TS episode featuring Scott Kurtz and Kris Straub (\"The Takeover\"), we thought it unfair to the universe not to create a web series featuring the comedic stylings of this dynamic duo. We approached Scott and Kris and we all agreed that this should happen.  However, after emptying our pockets on the table we realized that it would be difficult to produce the show on a handful of lint-covered Runts, two nickels, and a rupee (?).  So, in need of capital to make this show a reality, we humbly come to you.\nWhat, you ask, would a Scott and Kris show entail? We're looking to produce a ten-episode series (like the pilot episode above) in addition to a three-disc DVD featuring outtakes and behind-the-scenes material. When we reach our goal, the show will air on PATV starting Summer 2011.\nThe budget from Kickstarter will go solely towards the cost of production: cameras, microphones, editing, travel, soundtrack music, audio mixing, DVD authoring and duplication, Kickstarter and Amazon fees, and so on.\nBy backing this project, not only will you be helping us produce the show, you'll have access to unique and exclusive rewards including signed copies of the DVD, your name in the show credits, original art and books from Scott and Kris, extra footage of the production and much more.\nWe're excited about this project because we get to work with Scott and Kris. You might be excited about this project because you get to see Scott and Kris. Most importantly, Kris is excited about this project because he believes it's one step closer to reuniting with his estranged father. Scott's just always \"excited.\"\nSo let's make it happen.\nHelp spread the word: http://www.tinyurl.com/scottkristv\nThank you so much for your support!\n- Vantage Point Productions", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #18", "update_userinfo": "Final Rewards", "update_content": ""}, {"status": []}], "comments": [{"username": "Daniel Vidana", "content": "I hope everyone got what they wanted by now.", "time": "10 months ago"}, {"username": "Matt Woods", "content": "I come back to this garbage dump once every 6-8 months to remind myself to never back anything on KS again. $100 well spent I guess.", "time": "7 months ago"}, {"username": "Andr\u00e9 Leclerc", "content": "I got my sketch and book from Kris late 2014.

That is two updates in 8 months with the series finishing just under a year ago. Again, I understand that DvD vendors and such are fickle and it has been hard, but still....2 updates in such a time span is appalling.

See more here: \nField Notes book as a Thank You card\nUPDATE:\nWe've rebranded RDTN as Safecast. Here's an in-depth explanation behind the name change:\nhttp://blog.rdtn.org/2011/04/24/rdtn-is-now-safecast/\nAnd for some information about how the funding will be applied, see this post:\nhttp://blog.safecast.org/2011/04/24/first-safecast/\nAbout:\nSafecast.org (formerly RDTN.org) is a website whose purpose is to provide an aggregate feed of nuclear radiation data from governmental, non-governmental and citizen-scientist sources. That data will be made available to everyone, including scientists and nuclear experts who can provide context for lay people. In the weeks following launch, it has become evident that there is a need for additional radiation reporting from the ground in Japan. This Kickstarter project will help us purchase up to 600 Geiger Counter devices that will be deployed to Japan. (The project minimum will fund about 100 devices). The data captured from these devices will feed into our website and will also be made available for others to use via Pachube, an open-source platform for monitoring sensor data globally. Our field members will be trained by ouradvisors to properly use these devices. The field members will be required to report to the website 8-10 times per day.\nOpen-Source Underpinnings:\nWe will make the raw data available from our network for anyone to use under Creative Commons 0 dedication. It is our goal that providing this data to non-profit organizations, governments and scientists will keep people and societies more informed in the current crisis as well as future incidents where data might otherwise be scarce. \nPhase 1 and Phase 2:\nWe want to eventually build our own network of devices. We recognize, however, that there\u2019s an immediate need to get devices on the ground now. So our project has two phases. Phase 1 is about getting devices out to the areas with the least amount of data. Phase 2 will focus on  building a larger network of devices that will help governments, citizens and organizations understand immediate and long-term implications of radiation levels.\nWhere will they be deployed?\nIn looking at a map of radiation detection in Japan, there are many holes where no data is being captured whatsoever. Some of those are very close to Fukushima while others are well outside of Tokyo. The initial set of devices will be utilized in areas where coverage is sparse. We will deliver these devices to people on the ground who have been trained in how to use them. It could be a teacher, a university student, or a citizen scientist looking to contribute to the project.\nWho will be using these devices?\nWe want to provide the device to someone who has an above-average understanding of technology, but not necessarily an expert. This should be someone who knows how to install an app on their iPhone or Android device, and is familiar with filling out forms on websites. No programming skills or engineering degree is required. Knowing how to set up a wifi-router is a plus.\nDevice List: (UPDATED)\nWe are currently working with a distributor of detection devices in order to get them at a discounted cost. Due to the ease of use of the CRM-100, we have decided to focus on this unit for our volunteers in Japan.\nCRM-100\nThe CRM-100 is a general purpose geiger counter that measures alpha, beta, gamma, and x-radiation. It is intended for personal safety and educational purposes, not for professional applications. Like the popular Radalert 100, the CRM-100 features a 3-second update on its digital liquid crystal display (LCD). The LCD shows the current radiation level in your choice of milliroentgens per hour from .001 to 110 or counts per minute (cpm) from 0 to 350,000. When SI units are selected, the LCD shows readings in microsieverts per hour from .01 to 1100 or counts per second (cps) from 0 to 3,500. This instrument also offers an accumulated total and timer function, up to 9,999,000 counts and 40 hours. A red LED blinks and a beeper chirps with each count (the chirp can be muted).

Someone calls your name; this person is dressed as a businessman with the face of a pig. He leads you into a room where you have to crawl through a tunnel. As you enter the next room, you are met by wise creatures who tell you stories and give you gifts to aid you on the journey you are about to embark on. You eventually find yourself faced with strange challenges where you must answer riddles and appear on weirdo talk shows to discover that without you and your decisions, this world would not exist. In this journey, YOU become the hero, YOU are the main character.\nThe Rooms Play is a collaborative, immersive theatrical experience that asks the viewer to become a participant in the performance. There are twenty- two rooms to walk through, and each one is directed by a different team of 2-5 local artists and musicians. Each space in The Rooms Play functions like a scene of a play, and the audience members are integral to the scene\u2019s unfolding.\nThe narrative bases for the first rooms play (the video shown above) were Joseph Campbell\u2019s Mono-myth and the digestive system. The mono-myth refers to a basic pattern found in stories around the world; it is the skeletal story arc of a hero\u2019s journey. Combining these two \u201cstorylines\u201d we crafted a unique written proposal, which defines both the conceptual basis for the play and the architectural structure corresponding to each room. This was then presented to at least 60 different artists in Baltimore, of which over 40 participated. What resulted was an immensely collaborative, vividly transformative experience for those involved and those who participated (the audience).\nA huge aspect of this project is to create a form of art where artists can empower one another through collaboration, recognizing their importance and voice as culture-makers. The basis of our conversation is the artists proposal, which incorporated social issues such as immigration and racism as the foundation of the story that the artists will follow. With over 20 artists already on board, regular bi-weekly meetings and conversations with the artists through the entire process will be extending the conversation of immigration outside of the play itself.\nFor this year\u2019s Rooms Play immigration will act as our inspiration for movement. We are encouraging artistic meditation on what it means to be faced with the challenges of legal, ill legal, alien(nation) and othering. This year, the play will focus more specifically on issues of power, control, and choice. The theme of freedom and its guises are being explored through a re-writing of the heroes journey to reflect contemporary uses of power and control.\nHow this takes place?\nRooms Play is going to be a part of the 8th annual Transmodern Arts Festival here in Baltimore, Maryland. You can explore the website if you go here: http://www.transmodernfestival.org\nEach of the 20 rooms will be constructed in a large warehouse space. The rooms are mostly made of lumber and fabric, with individual installations determining the exact configuration and size of the spaces. The installation and performances in each room are created by a different team of artists, who serve as the creative directors for that room. The installations are created with all sorts of things - lightbulbs, plastic paper bags, huge sheets of colored paper, plants, paint, loft spaces, you name it - the materials needed for the construction of an environment and costumes vary with each participant artist's imagination. We think BIG.\nThis is where the budget comes in!\nIt is important for us to pay the artists involved, we want the artists to be able to do what is important to them while also being able to afford their rent. We also need to buy the materials such as lumber, fabric, nails and staples! We aim to be ecologically conscious - buying and using resourced materials - while maintaining safety; thus we are buying as many of our materials as possible from local businesses that sell resourced material.\nAlthough we are asking for $5000, the calculations call for a higher number of funds. Every little bit helps!\nBudget Description\nPERSONNEL: based on stipend for time and materials Room (split among artists per room) $200 x 21(rooms)= $4200 Videographer $150 Photographer $150 Poster designer $150\nMATERIALS: based on average prices and approximations.

All involved musicians give freely of their time to rehearse and perform the music of some of the world's most cherished artists. To date our tributes have included the work of: Nils Lofgren, Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Nick Lowe, Allen Toussaint, Warren Zevon and Neil Finn. These shows have exposed new generations to the music of these fine artists and their amazing catalog of work.\nLast August, in celebration of the 40th Anniversary to Woodstock, over sixty musicians performed an inspired tribute celebrating the music performed at the historic festival (culminating in the finale of \"With a Little Help From My Friends,\" pictured above) at Strathmore Music Center. We are asking those who have enjoyed and supported our shows to help us raise money to produce our next tribute CD, The British Invasion music from 1964-1966. By becoming a backer, you not only get a copy of our British Invasion CD, you support the hundreds of musicians who have been on our collective shows. Our CDs provide widespread exposure for new musicians on the local scene by introducing them to the world playing the tunes you know and love.\nSome of the musicians who have performed on our shows include Stueart Smith (The Eagles), John Jennings (Mary Chapin Carpenter), Jon Carroll (Mary Chapin, Peter Wolf), Bill Dannoff (Starland Vocal Band), Skunk Baxter (Doobie Brothers), and national acts like Eddie From Ohio.

They are going through this discovery together. The five main characters, Luke, Mark, Jayce, Corey and Sam, are in a hardcore music band together called Hand of Blood.
