Note that the Ant-Man and Wasp Stretch Goals can only be found in the standard retail Core Box.\nWe will be offering backers the option to choose 2-Wave Expedited Shipping for their pledges! By selecting this option, we will separate your pledge into two shipping Waves. The First Wave will contain only the Marvel United: X-Men Core Box (however many copies you get) and it is estimated to deliver around September 2021, about the same time as the Core Box goes to retail. Then, the Second Wave will contain everything else in your pledge, including the box of Stretch Goals and all Optional Buys, and it is estimated to deliver around May 2022. Of course, by separating the shipping, the total cost of 2 different shipments will be charged, so by selecting this option you should notice an increase in your shipping cost and VAT if applicable. The finals costs will be calculated on the Pledg.it Pledge Manager system, however estimates for both waves are listed under 'Shipping Information'. Backers who select Single Wave Shipping will get their full pledge in the estimated May 2022 delivery date.\nPlease take note that once the system launches they'll also have different deadlines to confirm the pledges, with the Expedited shipment having a much earlier deadline. After the deadline to confirm the Expedited shipment pledges, all pledges (and extra pledges) containing the First Wave Core Box will be locked and will no longer be editable. However, everything related to the Second Wave will be editable up until the Second Wave deadline. This means that backers that confirm a 2-Wave Expedited Shipping order will still be able to add/remove pledges/add-ons related to the Second Wave after the First Wave deadline.\nNote: 2-Wave Expedited Shipping will not be available to backers in the UK.\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes, based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our Pledg.it pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal or Stripe. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more promo goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nDepending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the EU (European backers), UK (UK backers), Asia (Asian backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic Mutant pledge, for a 1 or 2-wave shipment. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address and that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose.\n>>> Note that, in compliance to the EU and UK laws, VAT will also be charged on the pledge manager system for EU and UK backers. At this time we cannot estimate the cost as the charges vary from country to country and it is based on the price of the order plus the actual shipping costs (which can only be properly determined in the system). However, rest assured that the full VAT to be charged on each pledge will be clearly displayed in the pledge manager system before final confirmation. European countries that are not part of the European Union or UK will not be charged VAT.\n**Latin America, Africa, and ROW estimates are based on USPS rates. If USPS is not available, these rates may change. \nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the Asia Hub at a later date, likely incurring increased shipping costs and possible customs fees. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, the content offered on Kickstarter. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\n To learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.\n                                                          \u00a9 2021 MARVEL", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 48th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as:\nProduction delays\nShipping delays\nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is May 2022, for single wave pledges, and for Expedited Shipment pledges, September 2021 and May 2022 for wave 1 and 2 respectively, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others. We've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in to the Pledge Manager and confirm your pledge in that system within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. All \u201cNo Reward\u201d pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms please do not pledge on this project, but instead wait for the retail release.\n\nTo make sure you have the best gaming experience, all CMON products are warrantied against manufacturing defects for 2 years from the of date purchase from CMON (proof of purchase required).

It is NOT an option for the '# or more Pins!' tier choices, and is only available as an add-on or by itself.\nHard enamel pins are decorative art pins that can be worn or otherwise displayed. They have raised metal lines forming the 'line art' and the recessed sections between the lines are filled with colorful hard enamel.  Then the whole thing is polished smooth!\nAn example of a pin I previously designed, the Kitty Reaper\nAbove you can see the front, side and back of the Kitty Reaper, a pin I designed and had produced last year!  The back of the pins have pointed posts with rubber clutches to hold the pins in place when worn. \nPins I have designed worn on a jacket, a lanyard and a small backpack\nPeople wear pins on jackets, bags, lanyards and other articles of clothing.  Some people prefer to display their collections in shadow boxes or on cork boards.\nI also like to put them on my dice bags!\nSeries 1\nIn January 2020 after my wife and I had our third child I was taking the night shifts with the new little one so that my wife could try to get some rest.  Most nights I had a sleeping newborn cradled in one arm and a sketchbook within reach of the other. Magic was happening between 2 AM and 5 AM and I ended up designing little black cats dressed as all 13 5e classes, plus a DM. \nI ran a Kickstarter to turn them into hard enamel pins and it grew well beyond my wildest dreams!  Over 1,100 people backed that project.  I ended up with 25 pin designs and nearly 15.000 individual pins produced in total!\nThe Series 1 designs in the green box will be available as add-ons in BackerKit when you are filling out your backer survey after the campaign is finished.\nSeries 2\nThis year I created all new designs for each of the classes and the Game Master!  I also switched the genders from what I did last year, so if a class was male last year, it is female this year. (You can choose to see whatever gender you like in the designs, as cats tend to look like cats regardless, but in my mind the pointy hands and feet are the girls, and the rounded hands and feet are the boys.)\nI may also have a few additional design surprises in store depending on how well this campaign does. \ud83d\ude09\nBut perhaps you had something more specific in mind? \nFor those with more specific taste, at the Custom Kitty reward tier I will work with you to design a Custom Kitty and have it produced as hard enamel pins.  Once they have been produced you will receive twenty-five (25) pins of your choice from this Series 2 campaign.  Get 25 of your Custom Kitty or swap some out for other pins from this project, it is all up to you!\nI, Joshua Pinkas, will retain all rights to the resulting design and will be able to sell and distribute additional pins or any other derivative work in perpetuity.  \nCustom Kitties doesn't have to play by the 'rules'.  While it could be inspired by a DnD player class it doesn't have to be.  Maybe a brightly colored witchdoctor is more up your alley, or perhaps a two headed ogre kitty!  If it generally can fit under the banner of the Fantasy genre it is fair game!\nThe resulting design will be similar in size and style to the other designs in this campaign and will also become selectable as a reward for other backers of this campaign.\nNo nudity, lewdness, gore, or obviously offense concepts will be allowed.  I reserve the right to refund your pledge in full and cease work on the custom kitty if for some reason we are unable to come to an agreement on the final design.\nIf you pledge at this tier and want pins in addition to the 25 described above please add an additional $8 US per pin you would like.\nI designed these awesome pins, but it is expensive to have them all produced as pins. Think of Kickstarter as a place for you to pre-order these pins to help me fund production.  It also helps me understand which designs are more popular than others.\nYou pledge money to this campaign, then when the campaign is over Kickstarter collects the money from you and gives it to me.  I will then send you a survey through a tool called BackerKit to find out which designs you want, and where I should ship them.  I then use the money to pay my production partner to make the pins.  Then when I receive the completed pins form my production partner I inspect them for quality, package them up and ship them out to you!\nIt will take several months for all of that to happen (especially for larger projects like I hope this one will be), but at the end of it we have brought something awesome into the world that didn't exist before, and I cannot do it without your support!\nThank you for helping me in my creative journey!\nBecause of the logistics involved with running a project such as this we have built in what we believe is a reasonable cushion time to handle any unforeseen complications.  If all goes well and we don't need the cushion time we will be shipping the pins out as early as we are able.  Having said that we greatly appreciate your understanding and support as we work to deliver you the highest quality we can.   \n My name is Joshua R. Pinkas and I am the creator and owner of Frost Dragon Designs, LLC.

Many of my previous designs are available for sale through my online shop, frostdragondesigns.com.\nAll of my designs are my own original creations. I start my creative process with traditional drawings in sketchbooks. Even the simplest of designs will usually go through a dozen or more revisions before I recreate it digitally and prepare the files to send to my manufacturers.\nI love launching new projects and designs on Kickstarter because this is where I got my start with my company, and because I have found a wonderfully supportive community here who genuinely care about creatives.\nEvery pin you back helps fund the production of new original designs!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI am a designer, not a manufacturer, so I have to trust my manufacturer to execute my designs at a high level and on time.

Over the decades, the tone, content and form of the stories told have evolved; shaped by the times in which they were created. As we carve out our corner of the setting, we strive to pay homage to the past, while being responsible in the present. To that end, we worked closely with a Native American history and cultural consultant who lives and works in his Native community. Under his guidance, we designed Native American survivor characters who stand against the undead hordes, and we ultimately chose not to portray Native Americans as zombies in the game. These characters will be revealed as the campaign progresses.\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes, based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal or Stripe. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more promo goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nDepending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the EU (European backers), UK (UK backers), Asia (Asian backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic Dead West pledge. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address and that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose.\n>>> Note that, in compliance to the EU and UK laws, VAT will also be charged on the pledge manager system for EU and UK backers. At this time we cannot estimate the cost as the charges vary from country to country and it is based on the price of the order plus the actual shipping costs (which can only be properly determined in the system). However, rest assured that the full VAT to be charged on each pledge will be clearly displayed in the pledge manager system before final confirmation. European countries that are not part of the European Union or UK will not be charged VAT.\n**Latin America, Africa, and ROW estimates are based on USPS rates. If USPS is not available, these rates may change.\nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the Asia Hub at a later date, likely incurring increased shipping costs and possible customs fees. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, the content offered on Kickstarter. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends.

However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline.

These cards provide keywords to spark your imagination and example phrases for their use. Written by novelists and organized by dungeon-masters, the cards are designed for quick on-the-fly use and inherently add randomization. The list of monster parts uniquely depicted include, but are not limited to, the following:\n Horns\n   Teeth\n   Claws\n   Protrusions\n   Bodily Forms (Hides, Ears, Eyes, etc.)\n   Tails\n   Wings\n   Tentacles \nBetween great heroes and great monsters lies the pinnacle of drama \u2014 Combat. The unrelenting tension that comes with knowing blood will be spilled, and life may be lost. Monster Description Cards will guide you while you detail these moments, providing keywords and examples for horns that PIERCE, claws that SLASH, tails that BLUDGEON, and more. Hundreds of new ways to describe monster strikes in these familiar categories: \nSlashing\nPiercing\nBlunt\n\nWhat happens when a monster is cornered, heavily injured, or both? What if the creature is smart enough to be deceitful, spiteful, or vindictive in its last moments? How can you subtly share that your monster is on its last legs, but there is still a worrisome hint of malice in their eyes? These questions are all answered by the LAST STAND section of the cards. Where examples help illustrate the response of creatures facing overwhelming odds and perhaps displaying heroism, sacrifice, or wickedness of their own.\n\n\n \u201cWRITERS OF ALL LEVELS LOVE THE IMPACTFUL NARRATIVE EXPERIENCES DESCRIPTION CARDS ADD TO THEIR WORKS\u201d \nThere are common composition principles that ask writers to \"show and not tell .\" That is, allow the reader to experience the story through actions, words, thoughts, senses, and feelings rather than through the author's summarization and cliches. The Monster Description Cards reinforces this principle by providing keywords to spark the imagination and elegant examples chock-full of distinctive story-building concepts.\n\"Cliche Busting Cards\"\nThere are three cliche busting writer's tools within the Monster Description Cards.\n\n 1. Above all else, the \"core descriptions\" provide brilliant creature concepts. They share unique ways to introduce or explain distinct physical features to an audience. These \"core descriptions\" allow writers to stay far away from monsters, terms, phrases, or even ideas that are now unoriginal and thoroughly overused.\n   2. The second tool in the deck is the Combat Sections. These areas focus on drawing an audience into the sheer violence of monstrous combat, exploring unsettling concepts like great height and length, great strength, even preternatural abilities. They touch on the tension that lingers with the threat of a hero's death. These cards collect these concepts and inherently randomize them for writers to literally draw inspiration.\n   3. The LAST STAND is a fresh and new idea for our card tools. Whether you write horror, sci-fi, or fantasy fiction, your creatures and oddities will need to be compelling and memorable, particularly in their last moments. The LAST STAND helps by offering depictions of your monstrosities on the verge of defeat while adding a bit of doubt in the reader's mind with one last defiant moment.\n  AS A STORYTELLER, HAVING A MEMORABLE ANTAGONIST IS A KEY INGREDIENT TO SUCCESS. SO JOIN US! WE BELIEVE YOU WILL LOVE THESE CARDS.\nFor GameMasters (In-game Play)\nThe cards will melt right into your game, and your players will think you are brilliant. They will provide idea after idea on improving monster encounters. But more importantly, they will also drive you to new, full-blown campaign ideas. The type of campaign that players will reminisce about for years to come. The Monster Description Cards archive these feats by offering up concepts over statistical modeled stat-blocks. The cards narrate one-of-a-kind characteristics that you can easily add to existing monsters, creatures, or oddities. \n\nIntroduce extraordinary creatures to your players, giving them clear signs of why they might be unique, even among their kin. \n\nImprove combat by focusing on the right adjectives associated with the body part landing the blow, such as claws, tails, or fangs. Not only are there specific narrations for specific body parts, but they are also broken down by blunt strikes, slashing strikes, and piercing strikes. With these multiple combinations, you can keep your combat fresh game after game. \n\nLastly, there are always moments in the game where a GM would like to subtly provide hope to their players by indicating the monster is nearing defeat. These epic final moments are depicted in the LAST STAND sections of the Monster Description Cards.\nWriting advice on worldbuilding typically leads towards lists of 'rules' and 'tips' which are either too general to be useful or downright wrong. The Monster Description Cards instead provide concepts and implementations of ideas capable of driving your imagination to discoveries about the world you want to create. Alongside the Magic Description Cards, the Monster Description Cards can immerse you in creative ideas and concepts that are anything but clich\u00e9.\n\nIF YOU'RE A GM, THIS IS AN EASY BUY, BUY, BUY DECISION.\n\nFamiliars and Animal Companions: Your Familiars and Animal Companions are cool as hell. Let me make them sound cool as hell. Select a few cards that match the combat style of your familiar or animal companion and hand them to the Gamemaster to describe their attacks with style. Critical hits made by your Familiars or Animal Companion should be magnificent, and these cards provide that strike description that can be so satisfying. You can even have a LAST STAND card ready for your Familiars or Animal Companion just if things come down to that. Moreover, the cards' descriptions can be the basis of the unique features that make your Familiar or Animal Companion distinctively yours. So let\u2019s build something special with these cards.\n\nShapeshifting: In tabletop RPGs, there are thousands of classes/powers/feats/spells that can shapeshift or grow body parts into lethal weapons. Thousands more transform hands to claws, teeth to fangs, arms to tentacles or growing tails, bony protrusions, even wings. Each of these wonderful transformations can benefit from the Monster Description Cards. The Cards will instantly make these transforms unique and unforgettable with clever depictions, separating your character's ability from the crowd of other characters with similar capabilities or sometimes the exact same class ability, power, feats, or spells.\n\nUsing the cards to depict transform spells: Using the Monster description cards to verbally illustrate the results of magical effects that modify a character's body is more than just a way to be unique; it's how you build a legacy. Stylize your character's abilities with these cards, so they are recognized by others, respected, or even feared.\n\nMonster Journal Entries: Commemorate the monsters you've encountered by inserting Monster Description Cards in your monster journal. Flip through cards of unique descriptions to depict the memorable battles along your character's journey. Each card is your personal trophy, a memento of your battle-scars from the most challenging encounters. You can even use these cards to log essential information about certain monsters in your campaign, making every entry a result of your character's meticulous observations during battle. Sing the song better than any bard could with these encounter-defining descriptions. \nBuild a strong visual library with the entire series of description cards from Conflict Games. The entire Description Cards line can be used as a database for ideas, concepts, events, environments, and fight scenes. Not only do these cards bring new ideas to concept art, but the combat styles and descriptions therein can help portray your creation in a way that works and sells a room on the idea.\n\nDuring the Concept art process, Game Design, and Film writing, an artist and designer often craft creative assets like anomalies, monsters, characters, and fight scenes that heavily influence the final work. Our Descriptions Cards have been used during this process for great success. If the goal is to provide realistically visualize ideas for VFX teams, animators, and modelers, then the Magic, Combat, and now Monster Description Cards can be an innovative way to help and become key part of your process.\nUnlike our previous description cards, these cards are double-sided and chock-full of goodness.\nBackers will receive: \n200+ Descriptions and introductions of various monster components\n  300+ Combat descriptions sorted by monster appendage\n  100+ \u201cLast Stand\u201d descriptions, for portraying monsters that are heavily damaged vengeful, desperate, or relentless\n  Printed on heavy card stock (350 gms)\n  Large Format Card (tarot sized cards)\n \nSize: 2.75'' x 4.75'' (70mm x 120mm)\n  Over 100 total cards, including stretch goals\nEach card is organized under the following general categories:\n Horns & Frills\u2014Horns are hard permanent outgrowths, often curved and pointed and typically found in pairs. Frills are upward-curving bony plates typically extending behind the skull.\n\n Fangs & Maws \u2014The Fangs category is considered the mouths, jaws, teeth, and maws of large, small, or odd creatures.\n   Claws & Pincers\u2014The claws category consists of pincers, paws, talons, and hooks. That is, any style of sharp, usually slender, and curved nail at the end of hands and feet.\n   Protrusions & Osteoderms\u2014This category consists of bony deposits that form knots above scales. Protrusions regularly produce sharp structures that can be used offensively, or widen scales and plates that add to the defenses of a monster.\n Bodily Forms\u2014Creature hides, eyes, noses, ears, or other physical oddities that might distinguish a creature from its nightmarish kin are the focus of this group.\n   Tails\u2014The hindmost part of a monster, such as the flexible extension of the backbone in a vertebrate. Tails can be used to whip, constrict, or trip an opponent.\n   Wings\u2014This category focuses on wings of all shapes and sizes, functional or non-functional: Elliptical wings, high-speed wings, long soaring wings, and more. For the cards combat backside, wings will batter with winds, slice with sharp edges, and stab with spiked ends for a unique description style.\n   Tentacles\u2014The tentacles cards help depict any elongated, boneless, flexible organs, limbs, antenna, or barbels of famed monsters.\nPotentially more to come with stretch goals, so please back and share this project.\n\nOne the backside of the cards are Combat Description for the associating Monster part. The cards are divided into three suits, which correspond to the three common attack types of Blunt, Slashing, and Piercing.\n \n\nWe understand that there are a multitude of genres, points-of-views, worlds, rulesets, and games that writers and tabletop gamers choose. That\u2019s why our writing philosophy dictates the following rules which will ensure our content is system-agnosit, narrative Neutral and friendly to writers at all levels of expertise:\n We don\u2019t describe the person perceiving the monster.\n   We don\u2019t give names to monsters.\n   We don\u2019t mention blood specifically, but generalizations like \u201cfluid\u201d are occasionally used .\n   We don\u2019t describe the surface the monster is on.\n   Nothing cheesy, corny, or racy will be accepted.\n   Both Heroes and Antagonists should be cool, so let\u2019s make them sound cool!\n  System Neutral: The card descriptions are not tied to any tabletop ruleset or Genre, meaning they can be used to describe monsters in any of your favorite tabletop-rpgs. If you run multiple games in multiple systems, these cards are great to use in any and all of your games.\nThe cards will help you answer question like these:\nIn a sea of zombies, what if you need one to stand out?\n  In a world of dragons what makes this dragon different? Special? Memorable?\nAnime is all about unique characters and ability, so why not use the cards to create singularity among a crowded field?\nREWARD SUMMARY\nPLEDGE LEVELS\n\n\n\n\n\nTo add an add-on to your Kickstarter pledge, follow these steps:\n1. Press the Manage Your Pledge Button. (If you have not pledged yet it will say Back this Project.) \n2. Increase your pledge in the Pledge Amount box by the total of the add-ons you want to add.\n3. Do not change the tier you are currently pledged at, unless you also want to change it while you are on this screen. You will then need to add the total of your add-ons onto the amount of the new tier you chose. After the end of the Kickstarter campaign you will receive a survey that will ask you questions so that you can explain how you would like the add-on money assigned, and customizations when applicable.\n\nVoice Overs in the App: As mentioned in this Backer Update, The app contains over 200 Voice overs performed by Classically Trained Voice Actors.  You can hear a few examples below.\nNote: Only the Monster Description Cards included \u2191\u2191\n\nAll Cards Included + Voice Overs\nVoice Over Examples:\n\n\n\nMany of the above add-ons are from Previous Kickstarters.

If we do hit these goals, each and every backer benefits! Here are a few, not all, of the initial stretch goals.\nUnlocked!\nA protective coating will be placed over each and every card to help guard them against spills, rough handling, and those who regularly have gooey fingers (you know who you are). Your investment will be much better protected with this card coating! We will also increase the density of the paper used in the cards from 250 to 350 gsm. What does that mean? An improvement to the density will increase the appearance of the printing and make the card stock even more substantial and harder to damage. That's right, this reward is both protective and appealing!\n\nThis stretch goal adds 2 cards \u2014Unlocked!\n\nThis stretch goal adds 2 cards \u2014Unlocked!\nThis stretch goal adds 2 cards \u2014Unlocked!\n\nThis stretch goal adds 2 cards \u2014Unlocked!\n\nThis stretch goal adds 2 cards \u2014Unlocked!\n\nThis stretch goal adds 2 cards \u2014Unlocked!\nThis stretch goal adds 2 cards \u2014Unlocked!\n\nThis stretch goal adds 2 cards \u2014Unlocked!\n\n\nEmail Mark with any ideas\n\n\nWe've been especially fortunate to find some great partners with whom to collaborate. In December, we will finalize any product design changes as dedicated by stretch goals and backer feedback. Going into January, we will focus our writing and editing teams on completing the product content. The cards will be produced in China by mid-February. By the end of February, decks and accessories will go on freight to U.S. soil. We will prepare the orders, and the very first batch of deck boxes will be ready to ship to the priority shipping backers by the end of March. By the end of April, we will start to fulfill other orders with physical rewards to our domestic backers, then international backers. \nWe will share updates to the estimated schedule via the Kickstarter update page.

BackerKit is the world's most trusted post-crowdfunding platform and we are proud to have them aboard. \nShipping in the USA will be included. International shipping will be between $15 and $25 dollars based on the number of items in your order.

Fortunately, this is our 5th Kickstarter under the Conflict Games LLC brand and we have consulted on over 20 others. The Monster Description Card Deck is a fairly straightforward product. However, the foreseen risks involved include shipping logistics and the unexpected cancellation of contracted artists, writers, editors or product manufacturers. In the case of contract cancellation, the contractor will need to be replaced. Which in turn, could delay the project's completion but shouldn\u2019t prevent its completion. \n\nIn regard to shipping, logistics could become burdensome. We are unable to control the fact that domestic and out-of-the-US shipping costs seem to be spiraling out of control. However with our target funding goal, we don't foresee this preventing the project from succeeding; although, it may impact delivery dates. \n\nThe one guarantee we can make is that we will be transparent with issues and communicate them to our backers as quickly as we can. We strongly believe our target funding goal is sufficient to complete our vision for the product. \n\nIf you're as excited about this card deck as we are, then help us exceed that goal - we have much more we wish to do for this card series. This is just the first step in an exciting journey so please JOIN US!\n\nPlease Note: The final design of the Monster Description Cards deck and stretch goals may vary as many of the graphics above are digitally produced. Examples of this include, rounded card corners vs squared corners and raised lettering vs flat ink on the final packaging.\n\n\nRequired Attribution Text\nThanks to:\nsolid platonic solids by Dank By Design from the Noun Project\nDeath by rayhan maulana rikzan from the Noun Project\nrating by Flatart from the Noun Project\ndigital by Eucalyp from the Noun Project\nstretch by KEN MURRAY from the Noun Project\nShipping by Gregor Cresnar from the Noun Project\nbooks by Yeong Rong Kim from the Noun Project\nD20 by Lonnie Tapscott from the Noun Project\nCards by Henry Ryder from the Noun Project\ntwo by Laura Reeny from the Noun Project\nfall by Rendra Tri Kusuma from the Noun Project\nUnicorn by Lazar Nikolic from the Noun Project\nStory by Lars Meiertoberens from the Noun Project\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Thank you kind Sir or Madam!", "descp": "You will receive project updates & Mark M.

However, some of the best descriptions are longer than others. This may be a problem for physical cards, but not for the digital products. Therefore, we will be doing another round of selection to ensure only the cream of the crop gets printed. At the same time, we did not want to shortchange you guys on the creative efforts because of trivial physical limitations. Therefore, we have also decided that all 880 descriptions will be published on the Digital products (i.e., API, app, and writer's grid).

However, I have been extraordinarily particular about the descriptions that make the final cut. In my mind, they must be good \u2014all of them.  For that reason, our writing room has created a ton of descriptions, and to guarantee high-quality creativity, we also have many rejections, edits, and rewrites. Each of these steps has gone slower than I anticipated.  I may add writers to the project, but I believe the best solution to the delay is to simply keep writing.

I'm a designer, calligrapher, and illustrator following my dreams of creating a line of joyous products for my shop. This is not my first enamel pin design but it is my first Kickstarter, and I'm so excited to share these designs with you!\nDon't worry \u2013 you won't be charged for your pledge unless the campaign meets its initial goal! \n\n\u2728 THE DESIGNS \u2728\nVintage postage and brightly colored designs are a couple of my favorite things! After the success of my Anemone Postage Stamp enamel pin, I had an idea to create a series of hard enamel pins that feature the sun and moon, incorporating them into a classic postage stamp design. \nThere are five total pin designs planned in this collection! The initial goal will unlock the first design, and each additional design will be unlocked if stretch goals are achieved. Limited edition and collector prints are available for certain pledge levels.\n\nALL PIN DESIGNS ARE NOW UNLOCKED! \n\n\n\u2728 BONUS GOODIES \u2728\nThree options for bonus goodies are available for this project!\n Limited edition 5\" x 7\" print: a full-color print of the original set of 4 pin designs! Printed digitally printed on acid-free, archival paper with an eggshell textured finish.\n Signed + Numbered Foil Prints: choose from a collector's edition 5\" x 7\" print of the original set of 4 pin designs in full color with gold foil accents, or gold foil on acid-free black paper. See below for a photo of these gorgeous prints!\nThese are available at certain pledge levels or as add-ons!\nLeft: Full color print with gold foil accents. Right: Gold foil print on black paper.\n\n\u2728 ADD-ONS \u2728\nAdd-ons are now available for the campaign! Now you can add extra pins to your pledge without changing your pledge amount (or losing your early bird status)!\n\nANEMONE POSTAGE STAMP PINS\nI'm also offering my Anemone Postage Stamps (photo below) as an add-on for those who are interested! These will be offered at the $10 campaign price, which is $1 off my Etsy shop listing. Woohoo, discounts!\nThis pin is my original postage stamp design (the one that started it all) and will match the other pins in size and shape. It's a great way to round off the collection, especially if you're pledging for all 5 pins!\nPOSTAGE STAMP STICKERS\nNow that all stretch goals have been unlocked, STICKERS to coordinate with the pin designs are available as an add-on (photo below)! These will be offered at a discounted price before they're listed in my Etsy shop at their regular price. Designs are already being produced and I'll have them in-hand at the beginning of December!\n\n\u2728 TIMELINE \u2728\nNovember 1st-December 1st: Kickstarter is live and pledging is open! Once the Kickstarter ends, a survey will go out to ask which pin designs you'd like as rewards.\nDecember-January: Pin production begins! Average production time is between 30-45 days, but depends on the final quantity.\nFebruary: Rewards will be shipped! All packages will be shipped via USPS First Class or Priority Mail, which include tracking information.\nNOTE: These dates are estimates and may change, but I'll keep backers updated if any delays occur!\n\n\u2728 SHIPPING \u2728\nDomestic (US) backers: All packages will be shipped via USPS First Class or Priority Mail, which include tracking information.\nInternational backers: Good news, international shipping is now open! \nPackages will be shipped via USPS with tracking.\nYou are responsible for paying customs fees, import taxes, service fees, and any duties that your country charges.\nTracking may not update once the package leaves the US, but don't panic! Tracking should update when the package arrives in your country.\nDue to COVID-19, shipping delays may occur. If your country is not accepting mail from the US during this time, please pledge responsibly \u2013 I can't be held liable for any delays in rewards due to international shipping, customs, etc.\n\n\u2728 OTHER DETAILS \u2728\nWant to follow me? You can find me on Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest \u2013 though I'm definitely most active on Instagram! \nPins will be made in North America with all other packaging/shipping materials proudly supporting small businesses in the USA.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEnamel pins are created in a factory and are made by hand, so there is always a possibility that large orders can be delayed, some colors may look different, and errors may occur. Current and final colors may look different in person than they do on your screen due to screen/monitor calibrations. Some details may be altered during the design process as well \u2013 that's to ensure we get the best enamel fill possible!\n\nOnly collector-quality pins will be shipped as rewards. Any seconds/B-grade/C-grade pins will be available for sale in my Etsy shop.\n\nShipping via USPS is the most affordable option for shipping pins but has its limitations, including delays, failure to scan the package at each post office destination, and other delays due to COVID-19. Patience is key! :)\n\nAnd of course, if there are any delays at all during production/manufacturing, backers will be updated!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "1 Pin", "descp": "Choose one (1) pin from the unlocked pin designs!

It's now the time to see what lies hidden and reveal the ship's final days.\"\n The basic idea behind Trip 1907 (second edition), is to provide an enhanced game play by limiting the webpage usage, and focus on the hardcopy. In this version the webpage is only for submitting the chapters answers and receiving puzzle hints.\nThe main differences between Trip 1907 Interactive Escape the Book Game and Trip 1907 (2nd Edition): Dark Sails are on the game experience. The new version does not need logging into the website. The passcodes are there to save your progress as well as the sanity system is now embedded inside the book.

Other than this we have collaborated with dozens of Kickstarters during these last two years. Providing models all round to community members in some of the most popular campaign offered in Digital on Kickstarter. \n\nAll Core models have already been created and will be delivered directly after the Kickstarter end, when payment is received. So no waiting more than necessary for your core files. All Stretch Goals have also been completed, but need to be tested and will be available shortly after that. \n\nDIGITAL MEDIA: We strive to produce models that will print with as little support and parts as possible. Some models print in one go whilst most are split up into parts which must be printed separately and then assembled. \n\nThe file format of choice will be .STL and the models shall be zipped and made available to the user for download. The user is responsible for downloading their product and must have a valid internet connection and email with which to collect their reward, via internet download. We will keep the files on our system for at least three months after the first date of issue. The user must ensure that he collects the files within this time frame or risk forfeit. Lovecraft will always try their utmost to ensure that you receive your files and we hope that you enjoy printing them as much as we have enjoyed creating them. If there are any issues please contact support@i-lovecraft.com \n\nBackers must realize that the resolution you obtain on your print is down to the system you use. Our high resolution files will give you almost render quality prints on high end Resin machines, whilst the same files will produce lesser resolution prints on standard FDM printers. At any rate, the files have been previously tested on Resin and FDM printers and have shown satisfactory produce. \n\nWe recommend FDM Prints with at least a 400micron nozzle and 150 micron layer height for terrain. A 100 micron layer height will give you outstanding prints all round. \n\nResin printers should have no problems obtaining excellent resolution and finish, even at 100 micron layer height although 50 micron layer height is recommended for minute sculpt detail clarity. Although miniatures and figurines can be split into smaller parts, large terrain pieces will require a standard 220x220mm print bed, standard for FDM Printers like the 'Ender3'. We do try to restrict the maximum size of models to 180mm sq where possible. \n\nWe supply the user with a design that has been tested on conventional home hobby printers and is proven to print. All the models are tested and sliced with 'Cura' software which is freeware and available to all backers for use. We recommend that backers use 'Cura' as it is fully tested with our models and we can offer customer support, if any problems are encountered. We are unable to give customer support for other slicing software and backers use this at their own risk. \n\nAll the files have been checked using Netfab, this means that PrusaSlicer should have no problems slicing these files. Many of the files are also tested using PrusaSlicer. \n\nAll accumulated Grab Bag, Bonus models, also known as Daily Bonus or Free Models are given freely, under no obligation, as is and as a gift and don't form part of the campaign or responsibilities associated with this. \n\nWhen using our digital media, we do not hold ourselves responsible for the production or manufacturing process of the design, this is exclusively up to the user. \n\nUsers may modify models and files at their own risk and only for their own personal use. Modified files are not guaranteed by us and as such, users do this under their own risk and know how. \n\nThe Images shown on the campaign page are just for visualization and although they may come very close, they may not be an exact representation of the final design or printed model, which may vary. \n\nWe reserve the right to alter any of the models shown, at any time, before delivery, with the intent of improving the design, or efficiency of production.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSomething else\nDigital distribution, no impact to the environment", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Super Backer and Add-on", "descp": "Help us by contributing and following this project.

Due to the popularity of the Dungeon Mats and Walls, it was important for us to find a way to bundle them in at a hefty discount, so we did just that!\nDiscounted rates: All add-ons are at least 20-25% off the retail rates!

Each theme will consist of 15 bases ideal for fantasy miniatures and printed at home on your own 3d printer.\nMy name is Casper and I am the designer behind BasicAid. I am a wargamer and miniature hobbyist through 25 years. For many years basing was the thing I liked the least about the hobby. The miniature was done, why would I bother with something extra like the base? Fast forward several years, and I have learned how important a great base is for a great miniature. The base really sets the scene and mood for the mini you used countless hours on.\nWell, why not have great bases in no time? That was my thought, and that is why I have chosen to release the bases I have designed. These bases are designed to be easy to print, and easy to place miniatures on while still being as epic and detailed as possible to really set the mood for your miniature. \nSo, let\u2019s dive into the themes and see what it's all about!\nI play Malifaux a lot, and I play Ressurectionists among other factions, so a Victorian graveyard was on the plate. There is ofcourse loads of tombstones, but also vines, roots and roses are growing all over the place, as I wanted it with a feeling of neglect. The place is holding the dead, and therefore shouldn\u2019t look too new. You will also find such things as a shallow grave being covered with dirt, Victorian lampposts and crucifixes. If I could add a low hanging mist to these bases I would, but that\u2019s the image I have in my mind, with the light from the lampposts seeping through and shadows moving just out of sight.\n5 examples from the Graveyard. Click the image for more renders\nA mosaic for every base, an image that I find well suited for all those awesome factions inspired by the far east out there. Whether you play as Yakuza, Ten Thunders, New Tokyo or some other far east inspired faction these will add so much atmosphere to your setting. This set, as the only one, is without further assets, but are solely focused on the mosaics. This is intentional and to avoid cluttering the base, as the base should set the stage and support the miniature, and with mosaics on all of them, I think a good balance was struck. \n5 examples from the Asian Temple. Click the image for more renders\nIn my mind I imagined some dusty, cluttered laboratory or floor in a wizards tower. Books, scrolls and runes should be all over the place. Reading spaces, experimental vials, potions and flask are of course also a big part of the scenery. I love the thought of elementals, summoned demons as well as wizards, sorcerors, conjurers and every other school of magic could reside on these bases. Good times in the raids of World of Warcraft in Kharazhan was just behind my eyes, while designing these spaces. Explore the cover of the different books, and you might be inspired to what magic user or bound creature should fit that particular base.\n5 examples from the Wizard Lab theme. Click the images for more.\nI really like the story behind this set. A major human settlement has fallen, are you placing the villain or the hero on the base? Do you choose a kobold, a skaven or an orc on top of the debris crying out their victory at the end of the sack? Or will it be the knight, the paladin, the adventurer exploring the ruins, retaking the settlement from evil? You will find leftovers in the ruins, and I hope it will inspire you to new adventures.\n5 examples from the Ruins theme. Click the image for more renders\nAmong one of my favourite races in RPGs and Warhammer when I was introduced to fantasy books and games at the age of ten, this race needed some awesome custom bases. As both Druuchi and Drow alike are very slave centric cultures, I chose to center the feel around chains, manacles and other uncomfortable stuff to lock up all the nice people that they raid. Runes for dark elves are pointy in my mind, like so many other\u2019s, and the floors are plenty decorated to give just that feel.\n5 examples from the Dark Elf theme in 30, 40 and 50 mm sizes\nIt could be Arakoa, Gryphkin, harpies, phoenixes or some other fantasy race or model with an avian feel you place here. In my mind, these are intelligent beings set in a civilized environment with pavements, art, statues and mosaics. I have tried to bring forward a sense of pride in their heritage or a cultural feel, where their own civilization is at the center. Feathers are abound, along with symbols of wings, birds, nests and eggs in different sizes and statues revering the avian forms. I hope you get the same feel.\n5 examples from the Skyhall theme in 30, 40 and 50 mm sizes\nThe Norse theme is as a dane close to my heart, so real runes and and runestones with a twist of fantasy has been my main inspiration for these bases. As most fantasy Dwarf lore is based on a lot of Viking art as well, the bases will also fit dwarves and even Space wolves for Warhammer 40k perfectly and so will any other miniatures in a cold setting.\n5 examples from the Norse theme. Click the picture for more.\nThat's the previews of the 7 themes. During the campaign, you will see spotlights on each theme, and there you can read more of the background behind the design, as well as see renders of every single base in that theme. \n\nAs a backer of lots of other campaigns, I love stretchgoals and how I keep checking on where we're at during a campaign, so I planned alot of very cool stuff for you guys! Here you can see into the future as we hopefully make this Kickstarter as full of content as possible!\nAll above are unlocked!\nAll the above are unlocked!\nFree Halloween gift for all backers!\nA special Halloween gift from BasicAid to all of you :) click the image for more info\n\nFREE GIFTS FROM THE 3DPRINTINGPRO!\nAs I have mentioned, I have collaborated with Greg Kourakos aka 3Dprintingpro on his Kickstarter:  Pit Fighter, Blood on the Sands and there are 4 scenic bases there made by me as a gift for backers, if you haven't already seen them. Now Greg has been so kind as to give all backers here, one of his fighters to you guys, whether you back his campaign or not! So as a free gift to all backers of my campaign, you get the Barbarian Queen!\nHere she is painted by the master of the cartoon style: Epic Duck Studios\nA wonderfull sculpt by RN Estudio who is among some of the best out there\nActually it was her who inspired me to my Gates of Valhalla base, and because of that, she will be bundled with the scenic base I made for her, so not only will all backers get this awesome sculpt thanks to the charity of Greg, you will also get this:\nOk I know that technically the gates of Valhalla should accomodate several hundreds of warriors marching abreast, but it's a sidegate, ok... :P\nHere they are together just like the base was made for her ;) (it's bluetack under her feet, not a fail)\nPrinted on Phrozen Sonic Mini, Elegoo ABS-like grey.\nMERCHANTS: the Barbarian Queen and Gates of Valhalla are both off limits, and NOT a part of the license, unless you are a merchant of both this Campaign and Pit Fighter: Blood in the Sands.\n\nFree gift from Mythic Miniatures!\nAs another gift I got a fine terrain set from Mythic Miniatures for you. These guys focus on modular terrain and really take it to a new level. See here how you can use these parts one by one or all together :D\nThey are live with their own campaign right now. Give it a look :)\nAs a gift these are EXCLUDED from merchant license and provided for all backers of \"all about the base\" and upwards (ie. not for solo theme backers).\n\n\nCollector pledge:\nOn top of the \"It's all about the base\", you will also get a pack of assets for you to change up your bases. The pack is from the start full of more than 30  different assets that fit one or more of the themes from this kickstarter. This pack will be increased as part of this campaign as we break through the stretchgoals! (50+ assets now due to stretchgoals)\nIt's more than fifty assets now thanks to the stretchgoals unlocked by the supporters, click the image to read more about added assets\n\n\nMerchant pledge:\nIf you want to sell physical prints of the files you will need a merchant license \u2013 see the Merchant pledge level. The license runs for just over a year from the 1st of December 2020 until the 31st of December 2021. You can print and sell as many copies as you like in that period, but you have no further rights to the digital files, which may not be sold, shared, loaned or in any other way made available for anyone else than you. After the period expires, you are welcome to contact me regarding an individual extension.\nBe aware the license is for 3D printing. Casting, making molds of and any other manufacturing proces other than 3D printing the files is not a part of the merchant license.\n\nDesigner pledge:\nWe will be part of the design proces together for a whole new set! You will inspire and set the overall tone for a set of bases I will make. You get to be part of the design of 3-5 bases depending on their size. You get to decide whether it's circle, square, oval or even hexagonal bases, if that's what you like. You will be the first to receive the bases you're part of, and when the rest of the set of at least 10 bases, are ready for release, you will also get that. You will also be mentioned as co-designer on the set.\nWill you ask for? sci-fi? Jungle? Egyptian? Something I haven't imagined yet? I look forward to the inspiration and ideas you bring.\n\nConcept:\nBasicAid delivers STL. files for bases. This means that after the kickstarter have ended, you will receive the files for which you have pledged and will be ready to print straight away without supports in most cases, see the print guide for more information. The pledges will be fullfilled via MiniHoarder.com who will ensure reliable and safe transfers of your files. \nEach set consists of seven 30 mm bases, five 40 mm bases and three 50 mm bases. If you need some other size, the bases can be rescaled in your go-to slicer before you print, though you should take one of the bases closest in size to the size you are rescaling to. Be aware that some details are so fine, that scaling down might tamper with the level of detail. The bases are designed with 28-32 mm scale miniatures in mind.\nDuring the campaign I will add a spotlight for every theme, so you can see closeups of the different bases for each theme along with more painted examples. Watch the update section.\n\nPrint guide:\nI testprint each and every base in this kickstarter before you get them. I printed them all on a Phrozen sonic mini and below you will find my settings in the screenshot, be aware that every printer is different, and that these are just my setting. I printed in Elegoo ABS like grey resin.\nMy Chitubox settings\nAs a hobbyist myself I know the value of getting pressupported items for your printer, and I have designed most of the bases in a way, that you can print them perfectly, directly on the plate. I did not want my ideas constrained by only making things to print supportless, so if the design needed it to be right, I did what I think looks the best. So some of the bases need support, and those supports are already included. So you don\u2019t need to do anything but add the files to your slicer and go print.\nNOTE, the supported versions are chitubox files.\nHere is a great guide from 3Dprintingpro to printing bases perfectly and easily on the plate. \nGreg from 3Dprintingpro is a friend and we have collaborated on his kickstarter: Pit Fighter: Blood on the sands, where I have made 4 custom, scenic bases for the backers there.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe themes presented here are 90 % done.

Although brave and determined, adventurers are only human! They are prone to the madness and pain the twisted dwellers of the dungeons will inflict upon them. Death can occur, but is not the worst fate: heroes can be driven mad and beyond help!\nPlease note minis come unpainted.\nThe game is played in campaigns of 11 missions. To reach the Darkest Dungeon itself, players will undertake 3 missions per threat level and vanquish the boss. Then, they will be strong enough to face the horrors of the Darkest Dungeon! They may emerge victorious... if they dispatch the source of evil that plagues the land.\nPlease note minis come unpainted.\nFor each hero, select 3 skills out of 7 before heading into your mission (and level the heroes up to gain access to more skills). In each room, pick the most suitable stance to best resolve the conflict! Then, on each turn, a player chooses two of the available actions of moving, interacting with the environment, changing their stance or using a skill (if eligible for their current stance). Triumph over encounters, resist rampant madness and emerge victorious before throwing yourself into another battle. Between missions, spend your time in the hamlet, visiting various buildings to find relief from the physical and mental trauma you\u2019ve just endured. Restore the hamlet to its former glory and it will reward you and help you to fulfill the ultimate goal.\nRPG-like heroes  \u2013 A robust level up system with a ton of customization for unique playable characters.\nStressful Affliction System \u2013 Heroes' personalities are paramount!

Producing thousands of products and coordinating their delivery to homes across the planet is a complex business, and there are many things which could go wrong. This is why we build in as much time for the unforeseen as possible. We want to ensure that we have the space to deal with any unexpected setbacks and still get your game to you before the estimated delivery date.\n\nTo give you a frame of reference for exactly when you will get your game, Mythic Battles: Pantheon, Time of Legends: Joan of Arc season 1 and Reichbusters: Projekt Vril have been delivered. Super Fantasy Brawl is going to complete fulfillment by the end of the month. Solomon Kane, a big scope project, is at the printer and will be delivered in two waves. In specific wave 1 is in mass production now and the wave 2 moulds are also now being produced. Time of Legends: Joan of Arc season 1.5 is on track and the first elements will be soon sent to production. Enchanters: East Quest has been printed and is going to ship this month. Steamwatchers is on track and will go to production soon, to make the March fulfilment. HEL: The Last Saga is currently in development.\n\nFor all our games, we communicate with our backers with regular updates on Kickstarter and on Gamefound (for our late pledgers) You can also find us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Discord, learn our news and project updates through our weekly Newscast and ask all your questions in our Q&A with Leo on YouTube every Wednesday evening.\n\nPlease note that the components, component counts, quality and rules, are all work in progress and subject to change.\n\nDelivery\n\nOur experience in our previous KS has shown us that there can be variances in terms of timing and remaining in schedule when it comes to anything produced in China, such as:\nProduction delays\nShipping delays\nCustoms delays\nAt the same time there are also the unpredictable factors; recently it was the Coronavirus outbreak, but there can be others such as weather conditions, strikes and others.\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is October 2021, but please bear in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nShipping\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials, and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented in this Kickstarter project.\nIf you do not finalise your pledge and pay for shipping by the closing date of the pledge manager, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the pledge manager has closed.\nIf you confirm your pledge by the closing date of the pledge manager, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and that outside of countries specifically listed as being \u201cfriendly\u201d (above) you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

In addition, if any part of your order cannot be delivered, then we will reimburse you the full cost of this component regardless of the date.\nIf you apply for a refund more than 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter then we will only be able to refund 85% of it. The difference is the amount of the unrecoverable fees paid to process your order.\nOnce we have started to process and pack your order, refunds will no longer be available.\nRefunds within the first 14 days are reversed via Stripe to the credit card you used to pledge originally. Any refunds requested after the 14 day period may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe or your credit card.

Relax while enjoying this elegant game of picking and potting herbs. Pot the best collection of herbs in your different containers, but don\u2019t wait too long or your friend might grab them first.       \nA Tiny Edition for Travel\nHerbaceous Pocket is the same great game in an even smaller package. Herbaceous is a simple to learn, push your luck, set collection game. \n Smooth, streamlined rounds make Herbaceous a fast-moving, engaging game of picking and sharing herbs.\n The Pocket Edition is complete with all cards, dividers, and rules included. Visual adjustments were made to maximize clarity of the smaller size cards.  \nSteve Finn (Dr. Finn's Games) - renowned designer of Biblios and The Butterfly Garden - has created a wonderful compliment to Beth Sobel's stunning herb art. Eduardo Baraf is at the helm of Herbaceous Pocket to ensure it delivers Herbaceous' perfect balance of simple play, interesting moments, and wonderful art in a fantastic, tiny, package.   \n Keith Matejka (Thunderworks Games) - designer of Bullfrogs, Roll Player, and Skulk Hollow - created the additional rules for solo play, loved for its easy, rapid play.  \nHerbaceous is Zee Garcia's #1 relaxing game (and Mike Disilio's #4). The new, great way to experience Herbaceous with a cup of tea.  \n\n\nThe pocket edition of the Flavor Pack Mini-Expansion includes Cinnamon, Star Anise, and Peppercorn and adds a little extra spice to Herbaceous' flavorful play. \nAll Kickstarter backers who pledge for Herbaceous Pocket Edition will also receive the Flavor Pack Mini-Expansion for Free. This expansion will be available for sale typically for $5 separately on BGG, at Conventions, the PFG Store, etc. It will not be packaged within the base game.     \nMy Mother Gives an Overview of How to Play the original Herbaceous - she has the prototype from our first KS.\nRodney Smith from Watch It Played teaches Herbaceous .

We set out to make a perfect, pocket, edition of the classic game. Aside from size, card and component quality is in line with the original game.\n\n\n\nPFG worked with various partners to find a cost effective way to ship a single copy of Herbaceous: Pocket Edition internationally. Unfortunately, in a padded envelope, it is just a smidge too thick for international letter shipping. Therefore it is basically the same cost of shipping a small game (and there are a lot of additional shipping fees these days). \nHowever, since it is so small / light, it doesn't cost more to ship 2 or 3 copies in the same box. If you are outside of the US, I highly recommend buying the double or triple pack to split with a friend or give it as a gift.

Think of it like an escape room you can do at home! In this game you're searching for hidden clues and puzzles in beautifully created notes from an alchemists' apprentice. \nMysteries of Alchemy : Collector's Edition\nThe notes are sent to you by James, the butler of late Bram van Amstel, one of the first professional treasure hunters from the previous century. Try to unravel the puzzles and clues to find the treasure! You can play alone or with friends. You might be really surprised when you finally find the treasure and see what it is.\n\nWHAT'S INSIDE\nMysteries of Alchemy exists on a number of papers (a4 size) containing the notes from an alchemists' apprentice. In the picture below you see an overview of some of the papers. Extra papers will be in the game but we are keeping them a surprise for now. \nOverview of some of the papers\nOne of the puzzles called Tabula\nOne of the puzzles called Distillation (SPOILER FREE IMAGE)\n\nHOW TO PLAY\nPlay solo or work together as a group. Each separate puzzle takes approximately 15 minutes or up depending on the previous experience of the player. \nAge 14+\n1 to 4 treasure hunters\n Appr. 90 to 120+ minutes \n\nThe puzzles are a variety of different kind of puzzles and no outside knowledge is needed to solve the puzzles.\nStep 1: Transform the room into one that is an alchemy lab from ancient times (optional)\nStep 2: Make sure you have some snacks and drinks\nStep 3: Open the envelope\nStep 4: Study Little John's notes and try to find and solve all puzzles\nStep 5: Check the separate solutions on the game's website\nStep 6: Celebrate your successful treasure hunt\n\nBACKGROUND INFORMATION\nFor those who already played and found The VOC Treasure, the name Bram van Amstel should ring a bell. For those who don't know Bram van Amstel, he was a very successful treasure hunter in the 20th century. A few years ago he passed away as an old man. In his last years he continued his treasure hunts from his home by doing lots of research in books, documents and online. He was an old man and traveling was impossible but he kept on researching and gathered lots of information about treasures yet to be found. \nIn his will he stated that all heirs would not receive any money from his inheritance. Instead Bram's butler James is going to send you unsolved treasure hunts. James started shipping The VOC Treasure last year and very soon he will send you the Mysteries of Alchemy.\n\nMaking Of\nTop: Aging papers with tea and coffee - Middle: Printed on hand pressed paper - Bottom: Drying aged papers\nThe last treasure hunt called The VOC Treasure had some unique items like a wooden box, a glass wine bottle and a fabric sea map and more. To match the same level, Mysteries of Alchemy is also made from quality materials and the production process is a mix from old and new techniques. \n\nThese are the steps for creating this game:\nstep 1: Research in archives looking for inspiration\nstep 2: Choose the books and pages which can be used for puzzles\nstep 3: Create the puzzles\nstep 4: Draw the pages by hand on normal A4 paper\nstep 5: Scan the pages and adjust them with Photoshop\nstep 6: Print the pages on hand pressed paper\nstep 7: Manually age the hand pressed papers\nStep 8: Drying the manually aged papers\nstep 9: Scan the manually aged hand pressed papers\nstep 10: Send the scans for beta testing\nstep 11: Adjust puzzles and redo step 4 to step 10\nMysteries of Alchemy : Collector's Edition will be printed on hand pressed paper and all pages from each Collector's Edition will be aged manually.\nPicture taken in a Dutch city tower called Sassenpoort\nFor those who love the looks of the game but can't or don't want to pay the price for the Collector's Edition there are two other options:\n Option 1: A digital game existing of scanned pages from the Collector's Edition in .pdf format. To make home printing easier (and cheaper) I'll include a .pdf version of the game on a white background as well.\n Option 2: Mystery of Alchemy existing of scanned pages from the Collector's Edition, printed on 200-250 grams uncoated paper\nMysteries of Alchemy - (option 1, the Standard Edition)\n\nSTORY\nThis is a story of a teenage boy named John Kleyne or as his fellow alchemy students would call him Little John. \nAs alchemists' apprentices one of the many things they were trying to discover was chrysopoeia, the art of turning base metals into nobel metals like gold. This process symbolically indicates the creation of the philosophers' stone.\nOne by one the students had interesting discoveries. But once a student told the alchemist about his discovery this student would disappear. At first it didn't seem alarming to the other the students but in the following months, other students would just simply vanish in thin air, after they made a discovery.\nWeeks went by before another student made a great discovery and he shared it immediately with the alchemist. It was a joyful moment in the middle of a wet and rainy week. Later that night, John had to clean some things and walked around the shed which the apprentices used for sleeping. It was still pouring rain when he heard some cracking sound coming from the woods. Over a couple of months the neighbourhood had some problems with wolves, so John hid himself behind a pile of chopped wood. He peeked through a hole between some larger logs and he was surprised to see the alchemist sneaking out of the woods holding a shovel. John thought to himself how strange it was and started thinking about the missing students from earlier that year. His curiosity took over and he waited five minutes after the alchemist entered his house before John cautiously followed the trail of wet and muddy footsteps into the wood. John had always been afraid of this dark and mysterious place but some strange force from within kept him going. Totally wet, he suddenly arrived at a open circle in the wood. Stones were placed in a circle and in the middle of the circle he found something that looked like a freshly dug grave....\n\nTreasure - John knew immediately that he wouldn't be safe if he shared his discovery with the alchemist. Earlier that week he was getting more and more close to creating something really valuable. It was only a matter of days before John would discovered the complete and correct process of (***** spoiler alert).\nAbraham, his best friend among the students always told him stories about treasures maps with clues, puzzles and immense hidden treasures. What if hid his discovery in his notes like some kind of a treasure map and never tell the alchemist...?\nHe reached over to get the last book. It was just out of his reach so he leaned over a bit more. The ladder made some strange and dangerous noises when he almost lost his balance. His index finger hooked behind the top of the book when he slipped. The book fell down and with an acrobatic move Bram prevented himself from falling. Hanging onto the ladder he saw some old looking papers dropping out of the book on the ground. \"Really, are those the papers I was looking for....?\"\n\nBeta Test and Review\nSome of the leading people in the At Home Mystery industry helped to create this game by beta testing the puzzles. Due to the Corona Pandemic Zoom and Skype are used for long distance contact. For beta testing zoom and Skype were really handy. I got to experience people playing the game and hear them thinking out loud when trying to solve the puzzles. This process helpt me with fine tuning the game.\nBETA TESTERS\n Rita Orlov - PostCurious (The Tale Of Ord & The Emerald Flame)\n Errol Elumir -  Invers Genius (Podcast Room Escape Divas & Cryptex Hunt\n Michelle Rundbaken - Society of Curiosities (Mysterious Map Heist & Mystery Subscription Box)\n Yacine Merzouk - Society of Curiosities (Mysterious Map Heist & Mystery Subscription Box)\n Chris Waters - Constructed Adventures (Numerous Tailored Treasure Hunts & Constructed Adventures Youtube Channel)\n Stephen Lockyer - Escapage (Flatpak, Arrival, Escape The Compound, Vica Versa, Miracle '47 and Prisoner 7)\nJillian Raymond\nTop Left: Chris Waters from Constructed Adventures - Top Right: Michelle Rundbaken and Yacine Merzouk from Society Of Curiosities - Bottom Left: Jachin Letwory the creator from Mysteries of Alchemy - Bottom Right: Errol Elumir from Room Escape Divas and Inverse Genius. *note, the beta testers had individual with Jachin\nREVIEWS\nMichelle Rundbaken - Society of Curiosities \n\"The papers look so authentic and we loved that the puzzles were firmly rooted in alchemy manuscripts.

A hearty set of 10 vibrant and fun hard enamel pins expressing every board game addict's most commonly used sayings and little inside jokes!\nI'm Michelle, I am a designer who married a board gamer, and this pin set is the result. \nIf you missed part one, scroll down to the bottom to see pictures from the previous mega set of board gamer pins. If you're a previous backer, welcome back! To thank you all for your patience, I am just going to come out and give all returning backers 1 free pin! Check the FAQ for more info and thanks for coming back!\nThank you for backing this campaign!\nBy backing this campaign, you get:\nTo be FIRST to get your hands on these pins, before they're available for sale to anyone else\nAccess to these major bundle discounts (including a free pin for returning backers) that won't be matched after the campaign\nFree stickers included with your rewards!\n Free Bonus stretch goals! (scroll down for more info) \nPins that aren't funded during this campaign won't exist later, so thank you for giving these pins a chance!\n(Give this gif a minute to load for maximum shininess!)\nThe Pins:\nThe main funding goal of $400 covers this first tier \"All These Board Games\" pin AND Sticker Sheet. Each additional $400 raised after that funds and unlocks another pin that you will be able to pick as a reward!\n\n\nEach of these pins will be made with :\n Black Nickel metal plating\n 2 pinbacks with clear rubber clutches to eliminate spinning and keep your pin secure\nWhite, grays, and a color pop of these playful, bright colors (except for the first pin, which gets ALL the colors!) These were designed with pantone colors to ensure accuracy in manufacturing, but please note that all screens display colors a little differently. (If you bought the first set, the colors will match, plus two new colors added for this set)\nHard Enamel\nIf you're familiar with the last set of pins, these pins are all the same size as the \"board gamer\" pin, except \"All these board games\", which is a little big taller.\nThe preview images you see on this page are mockup renderings! While the real pins will be shiny and pretty, of course nothing in real life can be as perfectly flat and glossy as a digital rendering (nor can they stand up magically on their own). For a realistic idea of how the final pins will look, please see some actual photographs of the first kickstarter set at the bottom of this page.\nFREEBIE Game-Weight Stickers:\n5 stickers will be unlocked alongside the pins in the campaign and included for FREE according to your reward level! They will be sturdy, glossy stickers, 2.5 in. tall, on heavy duty vinyl. \n\nSticker Sheet:\nThis 5x7 inch sticker sheet is unlocked from the get-go and includes sticker versions of all of the 10 pin designs. These individual stickers are ~1.5 in. tall, the same size as their pin brethren. (You'll also be able to add these to your reward later in the survey if you want.)\nEdit: I realize I left out the sticker sheet as a listed item in the top tier $85 10 pin reward slot but listed it in the description. I cannot edit the reward now that the campaign is running, but just to be clear, backers of this 10-pin reward tier WILL get the sticker sheet AND all 5 game weight stickers!\n\nBonus Stretch Goal Freebies!\nYou have all gone above and beyond what I expected for this kickstarter, so here\u2019s more FREE STUFF!! Magnets are free to ALL pin backers (everyone who has backed for at least 1 pin reward) and will automatically be added to your reward. Keychains are free and automatically added to all backers of AT LEAST 6 pins. If we get all the way to $9000, everyone who has backed at least 1 pin will get a free embroidered patch! These are cumulative, so if we make it to $9000 you\u2019ll get all of these extra stretch goal items for which you are eligible!\nAll of these extra stretch goals that we unlock will be available as ADD-ONS in the backerkit survey, so even if you backed for the sticker-only rewards and aren\u2019t eligible to get a keychain for free, you can still get one for $10 USD plus shipping (or a patch or magnet for $5 USD) and shipped with your other rewards.\nA flexible magnet perfect for your refrigerator or other magnetic surface! \n\nSlightly smaller than the pins themselves (so it won\u2019t be too clunky if it\u2019s on your keys).\nSame width as the \u201call these board games\u201d magnet.\n\nI do not have a realistic looking preview of how this patch will look when embroidered with thread, so you\u2019ll have to use your imagination. It may look slightly different than this mock up, as the edges will be sewn, but I\u2019m confident it\u2019s going to end up looking hella cool. It will include 11 colors of thread and I\u2019m very excited to see it!\nAdd-Ons\nI get lots of questions about add-ons (which you can also read about in the FAQ) but here's some basic info to help familiarize you with what you can do to get more stuff in addition to your pledged campaign reward, that'll be shipped at the same time as your pledge reward.\nYou can either wait for the backerkit survey after the campaign to purchase these items, or you may want to add the extra amount to your pledge NOW in your campaign pledge manager. That way you'll get charged the extra amount at the same time as you are charged for your main kickstarter pledge and the credit will be waiting for you so you can select extra pins and stickers in the backerkit survey and not be charged a second time. This will also avoid any extra transaction fees from a second transaction.\nCool, so some of the things you'll be able to add-on:\nThe previous campaign's 15 pin set \"Board Game Genres\" will all be available to purchase for $11 USD per pin\nThe previous campaign's 2.5 in. stickers (ask me about my kallax, first player, rules lawyer, less AP more VP) will be available for $3 USD per sticker\nThe previous campaign's sticker sheet of 15 game genre stickers will be available for $5 USD per sheet\nTHIS CAMPAIGN's freebie game weight stickers will be available for $3 USD per sticker\nTHIS CAMPAIGN's sticker sheet will be available for $5 USD per sheet\nMy \"Dragon's D20\" enamel pin (view on my site if you're curious!)\nAll additional unlocked Stretch Goal items from this campaign (keychains for $10 USD, magnets for $5 USD, and patch for $5 USD)\n\nTimeline\nAll of the design files have been finalized and approved and quoted by my manufacturing partner, who brought the last gorgeous set to life. Here's how I expect the next few months to go, barring any additional craziness in the world:\nOctober: This campaign will be live\nNovember: Surveys sent out\nMid-November: Funds received, pins and stickers begin manufacturing\nJanuary: Completed pins and stickers shipped to me and I begin checking them for quality and packaging them up for you\nLate January-February: Rewards sent out!\n(A note on international shipping: I am planning to use USPS First Class International Package service to save you all some cash, but it may take the pins weeks longer to reach you. During the last campaign, some people had significant postal system and customs delays. So, while you should expect between 7-21 days, there may be delays beyond this time frame. If you are an international backer and would like faster shipping, you can ADD $12 USD to your pledge, and I will ship your package USPS Priority, which should arrive in about a week. This option will also be available in the backerkit.)\nFunding Breakdown\nOf the initial $400 funding goal - covering the \"All These Board Games\" pin and sticker sheet - the budget breaks down as follows:\n70% Manufacturing costs for pins and stickers\n20% Shipping costs\n5-10% Kickstarter Fees\nThe FINAL first set of board gamer pins from the first kickstarter\nThe FINAL first set of board gamer pins and stickers from the first kickstarter\nThe best way to be sure that your favorite pin gets unlocked is to share this campaign with all of your board game night regulars! You can find posts to share on my instagram and twitter pages @polliadesign (and also a lot of other sketches, dice, and fun designs, if you feel like browsing!)\nThank you so much for supporting this campaign, these pins can't make it off the sketchbook page without each and every one of you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n*Backers are responsible for any customs and import taxes that may apply once the packages are out of my hands.

Because of this, we want to put all our energy into achieving the mass production of the game in the most simple and efficient way. That being said, we would rather not add any more goals to this project, besides, we are more than satisfied with Flora as it is right now!\nTo answer this, we need to explain first why we need funds. As you may now have figured out, this project is a dream for us, and as so we were willing to invest all we could to make it a reality. We invested not only two years of meetings and testing time, but also funds in the design, illustrations, video, sampling, and campaign. But the biggest roadblock we had was when we found out we needed $25000 to pay the manufacturers, print, and ship our game so it arrives on your shelf. If we reach our goal, we will be able to pay for the manufacturing and shipping of the first edition of Flora. As you can see from our campaign, samples of the game have already been produced and designs are complete. Apart from design improvements in some game components, we have our manufacturers lined up and ready to go.\nWe fell in love with the Kickstarter Boardgame community when we as individuals started backing projects and saw how we quickly became more than backers, we became a part of the project. We're proud to reward our Kickstarter backers with discounts on the game, first-in-line knowledge, insight into the project, and a direct line of communication to us as the creators.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 95% complete, we don't believe this is the least bit likely, and you can rest assured that we have been working for more than six months to keep this from happening.\nWe commit to communicate every step and update accordingly and have open communications to answer any questions or doubts about timing.\n\nRefund policy\n\nWe can make a refund within 60 days of the campaign\u2019s end, Kickstarter and payment processing fees included. After that, we still have a \u201cno questions asked\u201d refund policy, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 60 days).

This campaign will help give even more! \nWelcome to a delightful realm of beautiful gardens, vibrant flowers, and eye-catching scenery. Take up your spade and hone your finest gardening skills by crafting and nurturing the most majestic display of natural beauty, much to the envy of your neighbors over the wall.

In summary, game-play for Flourish is as follows: each turn, you will begin with 6 cards in your hand. Choose 1 card to play into your own garden and 2 cards to pass over the walls of your garden to your neighbors, who simultaneously play their own cards into their gardens. Once all players have played and passed, all players reveal their played card, add the passed cards from their neighbors to their hands, and draw a new card from the deck. Players will place twelve cards total in their garden, scoring its beauty both by the points on their own cards and their neighbors! Clever passing of cards and shrewd placement each season will ensure your garden is the most beautiful in the realm.\nRules May Change for Final Copy\nRules May Change for Final Copy\nClick here for the full GameTyrant Review of Flourish!\nCheck Out The 360\u00ba View of Flourish Here!\nShipping, Customs, and Brokerage Fees\nShipping and taxes will be charged in our pledge manager after the campaign.\nWe try to use local shipping facilities where possible to keep shipping costs reasonable.

In the first volume, you find a message from Mary:\nBeneath Mary\u2019s letter you\u2019ll discover a treasure trove of gorgeous hand-written documents, 2D and 3D jigsaw puzzles, mysterious objects and artifacts, and devious challenges. Prove your worth by studying the documents, constructing the jigsaws, and solving the puzzles... and you\u2019ll be treated to a heartbreaking story that culminates in a shocking reimagining of the truth behind Mary Shelley\u2019s famous novel.\nCombining the best of escape rooms, board games, and immersive theater, Mother of Frankenstein is a 10-15 hour cooperative gaming experience for between 1 and 6 players, ages 13 and up. Mother of Frankenstein was designed to be as welcoming and fun for newbies as it is rewarding for experts, combining the narrative complexity of a good novel with the physicality and challenge of a puzzle-filled escape room. Throw in a couple of clue-strewn jigsaw puzzles, and our game truly has something for everyone!\nOur final stretch(es)!\nStretchy!\nMother of Frankenstein is divided into three volumes. Volume 1 concerns Mary\u2019s teenage years and her education by her iconoclastic father. Players must complete three assignments\u2014poetry, music, and astronomy\u2014each of which is presented in the form of a puzzle. Simultaneously, Mary embarks on a love affair with the dashing (but married) poet Percy Shelley. The course of their courtship is laid out over 15 love letters, though players must read closely to determine the order of events!\nIn Volume 2, the venue changes to Germany, and Castle Frankenstein, where a fancy ball is being thrown on a balmy night in 1814. Players begin by constructing a 300-piece jigsaw puzzle of the castle\u2019s floorplan, then use it\u2014along with gossip rags, billiard hall schedules, and original drawings by comic book artist Liana Kangas\u2014to track the events of the evening.\nFinally, in Volume 3, you\u2019ll construct an epic 3D puzzle of Castle Frankenstein and descend into the secret laboratory hidden therein, where you\u2019ll discover what Mary learned under the tutelage of the famous alchemist who called the place home, and how it inspired her to write what many call the first science fiction novel, Frankenstein. \nWhen our heroes tweet, we screencap.\nThe Standard Edition of Mother of Frankenstein contains the following: \n The Ultimate Edition adds our special printing of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, featuring original art by comic book artist Liana Kangas (which has its own reward tier, if you just feel like a re-read!), as well as a ton of other fancy stuff.

Adventure gaming at its best!\u201d Jeremy Salinas \u2013 Man VS Meeple\n\"If 7th Continent was the journey, then 7th Citadel is the destination. This is a great evolution of the game mechanics.

Controlled by a mysterious individual, these elongated worms tirelessly dig underground tunnels, causing swathes of territory to sink into the bowels of the earth. \nAfter years of helplessness, the Protectorate finally found a defense against this scourge in the Necrodruids \u2013 men and women who rejected the sacred principles of the Druidic Order to draw upon blood and forbidden incantations. The Necrodruids used their blood rituals to create monstrous plant-creatures capable of combating the Burrowers.\nIn the Citadels, the Necrodruids\u2019 power centers, YOU grow and tend to the abominations developed within, whose seeds are then spread all over the world to protect the territory against the Burrowers. Working as a slave-gardener, you wish that a fatal accident or death by exhaustion would relieve you of your endless toil.\nThe world has clearly changed since the days of your forefathers. The Collapsing Lands are choked in gloom and dust belched up by the Burrowers. The horrific plant-creatures that were created to protect you have spread, sometimes out of control, and are now just as much of a threat to humanity as the Burrowers.\nOn a cold morning bathed in pale light, you awaken for another long day of hard labor in the sacred grove, unaware that this will be your last day at the Citadel and that the course of history is about to change...\n\nSolo or cooperative game for up to 4 players.\n30 seconds to set up the game, 30 seconds to save it!\n1000+ minutes of thrilling adventure per Threat.\nRelive the sensation of the adventure books where you are the hero!\nNo die rolls: the more energy you spend, the more you increase your chances of success, but the faster you burn out!\nLive a different adventure every time; there are countless surprises and the game remembers your choices!\nEarn new skills, unlock bonuses, construct buildings: your decisions determine your path. Choose your destiny!\nIn The 7th Citadel, you face a Threat which will inevitably come down on you (unless you perish before you get there!).\nEach Threat comes in the form of a booklet with several scenarios that follow one another, until the final scenario where you either win the game or succumb to the Threat.\nUnlike most board games, you will experience an adventure over time, but rest assured, a simple save system allows you to pause your game at any time to resume it later.\nYou are a slave-gardener, captive of The 7th Citadel for several years now.\nYou start the game by choosing one of the available characters. Each character has an optional quest and a personal Action Deck.\nCasek, female (front) and male (back) version of a playable character\nCasek's personal quest\nAs your adventure progresses, you will choose new skills to create the character YOU want to play. Far from the usual archetypes of warrior, mage, and healer, you will have the freedom to develop your character as you choose.\nAre you more into Cunning or Arcana?\nWhether you want to play a teenage arcane master with a slingshot, an eloquent adventurer who can sneak through the shadows, or an elderly swordsman who summons creatures to assist him in battle, the choice is yours!\nYou progress in the adventure by exploring the Collapsing Lands (the game board, made up of numbered cards).\nHere you undertake actions that usually result in taking numbered cards from the Adventure Deck to progress through the adventure. These are usually terrain cards or permanent events that will progressively form the game board, but also include obstacles and challenges to overcome, equipment, companions, and side quests.\nThe game is full of random events, always consistent with where you are, and many alternative cards to experience a different adventure every time you play.\nPay attention to the details and observe your environment carefully: it contains a lot of hidden information and numbers that will be very useful to you!\nEach turn, you collectively decide which character will take the next action (search, fight, move, speak, and more) from those available to them (on the terrain card where their miniature is, their character card, an event, one of their skills, etc.).\nThere are more than 30 actions that you can perform!\nAll actions have a cost (the minimum number of cards to draw from your Action Deck), a difficulty (the number of successes you must obtain) and consequences that vary depending on whether the action succeeds or fails. \nAn action is resolved in four steps: Preparation (choice of objects, companions, etc.), Draw, Result and Consequence.\nOver the course of the adventure, taking actions will gradually deplete your Action Deck. When you run out of cards in the Action Deck, you must perform a Recovery to replenish it by reshuffling the cards from your Discard, but you will then lose 5 life points.\nWhen you are almost out of life points, or when you've reached your scenario goal, it's time to return to the Citadel!\nThe Threat Booklet will detail the consequences of your actions, which will vary according to your choices and performance, and take you to a new scenario.\nThe Collapsing Lands is populated with dozens of non-player characters (NPCs). \nYou will be able to converse with these NPCs using the \u201cBook of Dialogues\u201d, which is divided into nonlinear numbered paragraphs. You will not only choose what your character says, but also the tone they use. Then you will find out what happens by reading the indicated paragraph number.\nA chapter from the Book of Dialogues\nThe Collapsing Lands is also a hostile world where you'll have to battle strange creatures in tactical encounters that take place over several rounds. \nThese compound actions are identified by the presence of a die, whose value indicates the difficulty of the round and decreases as you gain successes. The encounter ends when the die is removed from the card, usually after you have successfully completed the last round of battle.\nIf you want to get out unscathed, you'll need to equip yourself with weapons, armor, and spells, and you\u2019ll need to seek out companions. That won\u2019t be enough to truly face down the Threat, however! You must also develop your skills and your Citadel, and that's where your Destiny comes in.\nDuring your adventures you will gain Hope through your feats of arms and the completion of side quests.\nYou can spend it to acquire new skills, build buildings, send emissaries to map the Collapsing Lands, and much more. There are so many possibilities that you'll have to choose the direction YOU want to go in!\nBuildings will grant you powerful effects once built such as allowing you to start each scenario with more life points, items, or companions. They will also increase the characteristics (defense, knowledge, production\u2026) of your fellowship, in order to defeat the Threat.\nYou start the game with a map of the Kel Protectorate. This world map provides valuable information about places of interest \u2013 city-states, garrisons, waterways, etc. \u2013 in the world as it was before the war started. Unfortunately, things have changed a lot since then. \nYou will be able to send emissaries to map the Collapsing Lands to update your world map by inserting numbered cards into the plastic sleeves provided for this purpose. You'll be able to obtain interesting effects,  and might even gain the ability to start future scenarios from a more advantageous position, closer to your target destination!\nThe Collapsing Lands are aptly named. Every step you take could see the ground open up like a gaping maw, eager to swallow you whole. But what if there were a hidden world below, filled with secrets and treasures just waiting to be discovered?\n\u201cOn the Edge of Peril\u201d is an exclusive expansion offered in the Collector's Edition pledge. It includes 2 dividers, 30 cards, 1 rule sheet.\nIt expands your adventures with new Exploration cards that will hinder your progress until you fight off the danger.\nDuring your adventure, you may be instructed (no spoilers \ud83d\ude09) to slip the \u201cPeril\u201d divider behind the 110 card. Whenever you take a Terrain card stored after that divider (card nr. 111 and up), you must replace 1 Exploration card attached to that terrain with one showing the \u201cPeril\u201d (skull) icon.\nLuckily, you possess a Groundquaker, a powerful artifact stolen from the Necrodruids, which will help you push the divider further back and with it the edge of peril!\nWe\u2019ve been working on The 7th Citadel for over a year now.\nThe game\u2019s mechanics have been heavily tested over the last few months. Dozens of players have had the opportunity to try them out, notably at the Essen 2019 and FIJ (Cannes) 2020 trade fairs.

Bruno was 5 when \u201cThe Warlock of Firetop Mountain\u201d was published. Ludovic was 11 and already had a few prototypes on the go (one of which would eventually become The 7th Continent!).\nWe've been inspired by many great works during our lives, whether from board games, role-playing games or video games. When we started out in the board gaming industry, we naturally brought all of these elements with us.\nWe are not only the designers of the games Serious Poulp publishes: Ludovic also creates all of the illustrations and visual elements for our games and Bruno, apart from writing cards and rulebooks, supervises production.\nIn 2019, we were honored by the Spiel Des Jahres (kritikerpreis) award for the cooperative party game \u201cJust One\u201d we designed, published by Repos Production.\nBree has worked on Kickstarter campaigns in a variety of roles, from marketing and communications support to community management, a role which she is delighted to be handling for The 7th Citadel campaign. She lives in Las Vegas, NV with her two cats, Samus and Remy.

To date, we have delivered rewards to over 60,000 backers around the world.\n\nWe have accumulated experience and selected our partners (manufacturer, logistics, distribution centers) among the best in the world, so we are confident in our ability to deliver this project and ensure its follow-up (communication with the community, after-sales service) with the same professionalism that we have shown so far.\n\nThe main risk factor, which can never be excluded given the complexity of such a project and the potential number of backers, lies in a possible delay in delivery.\n\nCOMMITMENTS\n\nBecause you place your trust in us and allow us, through your support, to bring our project to life, we are keen to clarify our commitments to you.\n\nTo this end, we commit ourselves, as we have always done, to:\n\n1. not launch a new Kickstarter campaign until we have delivered the previous one.\n2. do everything possible to guarantee the sustainability of our company through sound management: control of its workforce, its operating costs and investments.\n3. ensure continuity as far as possible in the event of force majeure\n4. keep you informed with regular updates about the project until its delivery.\n\nWe would like to thank all our backers for the trust and support they have shown us since 2015!\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nAll pledges can be refunded up to the completion of the Pledge Manager, no questions asked.\nIf the refund is requested more than 15 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign, 15% will be deducted from the amount (corresponding to the charges incurred by Kickstarter and Stripe, since we will not be refunded at that point), and the refund will have to be done via PayPal instead of the Credit Card you used on Kickstarter.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAll payments (pledged on Kickstarter and/or in the pledge manager) will be made in \u20acuros. Any costs shown in $ will be based on the exchange rate in effect during the first day of the campaign (1$ = \u20ac0.85), the levy of your pledges and the pledge manager will be entirely in \u20acuros.\n\nBy pledging to this Kickstarter, you acknowledge that the final appearance, materials and content of the rewards (and the Kickstarter) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project is active.\n\nYou agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and that you are responsible for providing correct address information, and ensuring that this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret that we are unable to ship to PO Boxes in most countries. If you do not reside in a shipping friendly zone , you agree that you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities.\n\nIf you cannot accept these conditions, we advise that you do not back this project.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac69 or more", "title": "Collector\u2019s Edition", "descp": "Available in English and French.\nShipping charged after campaign ends.\nINCLUDES:\nExclusive Collector\u2019s Core Box\nFree Exclusive Expansion\nAll unlocked Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["18,695 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac119 or more", "title": "Gameplay All-in", "descp": "Available in English and French.\nShipping charged after campaign ends.\nINCLUDES:\nExclusive Collector\u2019s Core Box\nFree Exclusive Expansion\nThe Last Throne Additional Threat\nKnowledge is Power Expansion\nThe Unveilers Expansion\nThe Alembic of Valengarde Expansion\nAll unlocked Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["13,216 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #52", "update_userinfo": "June update \u2013 first glance at Life Counter", "update_content": "[Cliquez ici pour lire cette actu en fran\u00e7ais]\nHello adventurers,\nLudovic continues to work tirelessly on his illustrations and Bruno is making progress on the design of the Threat \u201cDrums of Desolation\u201d as well as writing the text for the hundreds of Terrain cards and permanent events linked to them.

A highly interactive game of fast paced chase & escape.\nSleepy little Cactus Town is going to see some action: you can wear the Sheriff\u2019s badge, join a group of dangerous outlaws, seek ransom as a bounty hunter or even use the power of seduction being an avenging Can Can dancer. Each party has its own objectives and its own unique actions, making this a perfect gateway game for asymmetric gameplay. With playing time of just 10-15 minutes per player, you can swap and play various parties each session.\n The DEPUTY is the game as it comes in retail. Oh wait, not quite, there is a LOT of extra content coming with stretch goals.\nNOW  THAT\u2019S  LUXURY!!!\nAbove Deluxe edition not only features awesome component upgrades (the minis alone will make you drool), but also exclusive game and player boards that will make your gameplay more organized and thematic. \nNote: Any items marked with the term \"KS-EXCLUSIVE\" will only be available on Kickstarter or through direct sales from the Publisher's online store or at fairs.\nThis 3D Print has been made with a non-professional home 3D printer final production quality will be even superior. THANKS to our friend Eva who did this at her home for us. Your minis will obviously come with a base, a 30mm one, but we kind of like the way the mini resembles the illustration on the card without base :)\n\nThe trip in our prairie schooner through \u201cstretch goal land\u201d to Cactus Town has been extremely productive! We finally arrived to Cactus Town with a loot of 26 stretch goals, including 2 social media/comment stretch goals. CONGRATS!\n These stretch goals are based on achieving certain goals based on your support in promoting the campaign. Read about it here. Current status of stretch goal completion (Oct. 20th, 3pm EST):\nKeep those comments, likes and posts coming, and remember that you can win a fabulous unique Dice Tower prototype, created by the talented folks of e-Raptor in Poland (Thanks for offering this as a prize, e-Raptor!).\n Dice Tower (English)\n Above video in English shows the gameplay for up to 3 players \n Above video in French shows the gameplay for up to 3 players \nAbove video in German shows the gameplay for up to 3 players \n Above video in Spanish shows the gameplay for up to 4 players\nPlayers program their actions with 3 out of 4 action cards each turn. Sounds easy enough, right? But careful, actions alternate between players and action cards are programmed in reverse order, meaning they are executed \"the other way around\". Mastering this is a real challenge. Can you out-think your opponents, guess their moves and get in your own. Or will you out-think yourself and create some hilarious chaos?\n\n\nThe player's characters move through a 5x5 building-card grid, which is set up randomly face down each game. The game includes an advanced version with building effects and several variants, giving you even more replay value. You try to position yourself so you can carry out your very personal (and asymmetric) actions to fulfill your objectives.\nAre you ready for a duel? Will you plunder for gold? Are you in the mood to dance a Can Can? Going to steal a horse, are you?

Not only the rulebook will come in your language, but also all cards, since this is a language dependent game.\nAnd the good thing? All languages will leave the factory at the same time!\nThere will also be volunteer-created PDF versions of the rulebook in Dutch, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian and Greek.\nBoardgame Heaven (English) \n  Rincon de Jugones (Espa\u00f1ol) \nShipping will be charged after the campaign through the pledge manager (we will work with Gamefound, the fastest growing pledge manager platform). Above shipping rates are estimates. \nThe exact shipping price will be defined after the campaign is over, when knowing the final weight and size of the different packages, and the backer distribution by region. As a simple rule, the more backers we have, the better we can streamline logistics and reduce shipping prices.\nThe USA, Canada, the European Union, the UK, Australia and many South East Asian countries (see table) will be \u201cFriendly Shipping\u201d. This means we will mass import the product into these regions and handle and pay all the import taxes, you won\u2019t have to incur additional cost. This is provided that legislation stays at it is, should any region (e.g. the US) impose new or significantly increased customs duties on board games manufactured in China, we reserve the right to pass these on to you before delivery. \nEuropean backers, note that we are paying the Value Added Tax due for your product, tax authorities handle this as a product sale, not an investment, so VAT applies. This is a hefty 21% as we are based in Spain. Please take this into account when comparing shipping prices to other regions, we are taking most of that burden on us and pass it on only partly. In future campaigns, we will likely follow the example of some recent campaigns who charge VAT to their European customers, as this is fairest to all. \nFor the overseas freight, we are working with global forwarding agents that allow visibility of the shipment at any time, as they are on their way to the various distribution centers. We will be using established fulfillment companies like Quartermaster Logistic, VFI, Aetherworks, Happyshops, and others, specialized and experienced in the fulfillment of Kickstarter projects, to cover the distance from distribution centers to your home.\nAll steps included, we calculate the product should arrive at your home latest middle of October 2021 (this includes some buffer for expected delays because of Covid).\nAre you a retailer smelling the opportunity of generating business with this great product in its KS exclusive version? This is your only chance to go for it, as the KS exclusive material will not be offered to retailers outside the campaign and pledge manager.\nThe retailer pledges offered are strictly for registered retail business, we require your business registration and tax ID number. Please contact through PM or write to business@secondgategames.com for information on higher volume discounts.\nWant to organize a group pledge using a local forum? Please contact through PM or write to business@secondgategames.com for information on what we can do for you at different volumes. You will have to be a group of 12+ backers.\nThis is Second Gate Games\u2019 third Kickstarter project, and the second we are doing as an independent publisher. We are extremely excited and motivated!\nIf we have learned one thing from our previous projects, it is to \u201cdrown you with stretch-goals\u201d ;) We have also learned that we should make the stretch goals available to gamers who miss the campaign, so they will be available on our online store afterwards (possibly at slightly higher prices).\nBut even more important than the campaign is the desire to provide you with a game that is both fun to play and beautiful to behold.\nThis high-end miniatures studio has created a wealth of awesome miniatures for games like Dark Age, Rum and Bones, Marvel United and others. Miniatures for our own B-Sieged were created by them, too. EXTREMELY talented guys!\n This project is promoted by Jellop, a direct\u00ad response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.\nAccelerating the creation of amazing games and giving amazing, free tools for creators to communicate with the community", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe creation process for a board game is a complex enterprise, especially for a game like ours with multiple languages and variants: design adjustments, approval processes, pre-production samples, printing & assembling, freight shipping, handling in logistic centers and finally the last shipment to your door. \n\nIf anything goes wrong or isn\u2019t perfectly right, there is a risk of delay at any of those steps. This is a simple reality that you as backer need to be aware of. If anything did indeed go awry, we would communicate this to you openly.\n\nHowever, we feel that we are well prepared for a good fulfillment process and minimize the risk of delay, for the following reasons:\n\n1. We have done about 95% of the illustration work and graphic design of the game, we are almost ready to push the button. Unless you crash all our planned stretch goals and we come up with more, of course ;)\n\n2. In our timing forecast, we have built in a buffer to allow for delays caused by the Covid Pandemia. If all goes to plan, we are going to deliver earlier than announced. It is quite likely that Covid WILL have some impact on the plan, though, so we are taking that into consideration.\n\n3. Our manufacturer has a proven track record in the gaming industry and the quality of our prototypes has been outstanding. Communication has been very smooth so far and we are sure this will continue.\n\n4. We are working with specialized fulfillment companies, we are sure they can handle all your pledges easily, they have the systems and the experience.\n\nLet us also point out that Cactus Town is not a one-off stunt for us.

Ian Kensington, captain of the British Engineering Forces, is responsible for the first successful recovery of a sunken ship. In the report to His Majesty King George I of England, Kensington mentions Davy Jones' locker for the first time.\nDespite it being a real artifact, he describes the locker in the context of a legend about the sea devil Davy Jones, who supposedly locks away the wandering souls of all sailors who lose their lives at the sea. It is told that on each sunken ship, he hides a replicate of the locker, promising to release all souls if someone manages to open the box.\n Since the first find, similar lockers were found in shipwrecks scattered around the world. Some of them are still kept in private collections, others in museums. However, nobody has been able to reveal their secret so far.\nWe are sure that you are the one, who will finally be able to open the locker and force Davy Jones to admit his defeat.\nTHE DESIGN AND PRODUCTION\nAccording to Davy Jones he decided to create a special version of the box and release it to the community of Kickstarter. His crafty and intrepid team of developers has spent the last eight months designing and testing this special version of the locker. The team explored a wide variety of interlocks and functionalities, and ultimately settled on a final version which was confirmed by Davy Jones as the most sophisticated version of his locker. \nWe will not hide that our team participated in the creation of the box, but even we don't have the details how to open it as the final mechanisms were personally crafted by the Sea Devil. In any case the Cluebox \u201eDavy Jones Locker\u201c is our most complex project to date\u2014 both from a design and manufacturing perspective. The puzzle is made with loving care out of birch wood and wood oil, consists of 72 individual parts assembled with care by hand.\nTEAM\nOur international team of game and puzzle enthusiasts, mainly based in Germany, established in 2015 company  and developed several innovative board game and puzzles focusing in escape games niche. Today we're very excited to present our first Kickstarter and will appreciate your support to bring our product to life. \nPirate music theme credit to Ross Bugden\nPackage design Federico Meloni/Chris Lattner\nMeet our team member locked in Davy Jones' cabinet and requested to announce start of the campaign.\nMEGABOX (Kickstarter special)\nFor Kickstarter we will produce a special edition of Megabox in multi-color.

We're really excited with number of people who decided to support us and we made a serious effort to match the level of expectations and get more mysterious artifacts from hands of Davy Jones.\nAnd today we succeed!  We achieved to get plans of his sundial, which is an important element in the process of solving Davy Jones' Locker: when solving the Locker, keep an eye on the time shown on the clock and don't ever cross the number 12. Otherwise the Locker will turn into ... actually you better don't know what is it, just trust us ;)\nEach one of our bekers will receive a wooden kit of sundial as a big thanks for your support.\nThe size of sundial is 6x6 cm.\n\nOther iDventure Puzzles\n Cluebox - Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat \nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat is a thought experiment by the Austrian physicist Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger that illustrates the problem of quantum mechanics in every day objects. In this experiment, a cat and some poison are locked in a closed box.\nAccording to Quantum Mechanics after a while the cat will be both dead and alive. Only by looking at the object, in this case the cat, the status will be determined. \nUnfortunately, Schr\u00f6dinger completely forgot the cat because of his busy daily routine.\nWe are sure that the cat is still alive, and you must save it!\nBox size: \nSecret space size: 1,5*4,5*8cm\nPlay time: 45-60 min\n Cluebox - Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat - MEGABOX \nFor Kickstarter we will produce a special edition of Megabox.

The reality is that shipping and sales taxes are expensive. To offset this we worked with our shipping partners to get the best conditions for our bakers on Kickstarter.  \nFor the EU, UK, US and Canada, your rewards will be sent duty-free from within your region - there will be no additional customs charge. We cannot guarantee customs-friendly shipping in areas outside of the US, Canada, UK and EU. There maybe additional duties and/or fees charged by your country\u2019s governmental agencies and/or shipping partners. Those fees are solely your responsibility, and we can neither cancel a shipped pledge, nor will we pay those fees. In the event that a package is returned or destroyed due to the non-payment of such fees, your pledge will be considered fulfilled.\nShipping charges will be added after the Kickstarter ends - every backer will be responsible for paying these in the pledge manager after the campaign ends.\nApproximate shipping prices listed in the table below, but subject to change based on the pledge size.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAt iDventure, we have a lot of experience fulfilling large orders on strict timelines.

Just multiply your pledge amount by however many more necklaces you want.

This can take anywhere from 2-8 weeks to arrive, depending on destination.

Each character has their own unique backstory.\n\nThe story behind this project\n Merchant : This merchant offers a broad range of wares, from llama spit to dragon scales! Find what you need, as long as you have the money!\n\n Merchant`s wife : selling medicinal herbs and spices. If something ails you she might be able to sooth your pain!\n\n Fortune teller : A woman with a good heart and the founder of the caravan, this fortune teller can reveal what lies ahead of time. She possesses magical abilities, among which is transforming herself into a younger and more seductive self! Who knows, it might come in handy one day! If you enter her tent please do not touch anything! Especially not the chest! Everyone has their secrets, right?\n\n Sisters of the war pact : Every camp needs guards, and these three sisters are it for our caravan! They have a strong bond with the caravan's founder, our fortune teller, who brought these orphaned girls up as her own daughters. With the proper fee, they'll happily join you in your adventures!\n\n Torn face : Fighting a ferocious monster with sharp claws left his face torn and disfigured! Lacking the proper expertise, the fortune teller resorted to just stitching the two sides of his face together. Blindness has sharpened one of the remaining senses, the sense of hearing, into an almost superhuman ability! His physical strength remains! No one can survive under his iron fists! \n\n Hunter : A sharp shooter with high visual acuity! No hunt is undergone without securing a bounty, bringing game and valuable live specimens back for trading.\n\n Dishonored knight : Only a true warrior knows the depths of shame after a defeat in combat. Being overwhelmed by his loss in combat, he wanted to take his own life, but some events, and the arrival of the caravan, prevented this outcome. He lost one of his arms, which made room for a curious innovation!\n\n Troupe group : Sit a while and listen! You will find entertainment for hours while you repose after a long day's journey.\n\n Servant girl : She was found unconscious, with the recent events being a blank. The only thing she can recollect is a dragon... yes, there was a dragon somewhere! (Stay tuned for future project!)\n\n Hunter - zombie version : Damn, that crate definitely had a \"do not touch\" sign on it! Our brave and curious hunter dared to get near a zombie that he found in the jungle, where it was dormant. The creature quickly sensed his presence and fiercely attacked him, succeeding in infecting him with a bite. He got bit but eventually managed to put the creature back in his crate! Our hunter has a secret now, that will end up transforming him! (Stay tuned for future project!)\n\n Dwarf : Who ever heard of a dwarf that doesn't like his liquor!? This renowned merchant sells the best wines around, sometimes rarities found in deep and forgotten cellars! \n\n Merchant`s daughter : Are you looking for fresh wild berries, fruits and vegetables? This is the place to look! This young merchant has a vibrant connection to nature and is easily able to source food!\n\nThe scale\nAll miniatures and props are scaled at 32 mm. All miniatures come in two version: with one inch round base and without a base. You can easily scale it in any size you want.\n\nDelivery time\nAll of these pictures are 3d renders or just rough sketches so please be mindful that changes can occur.

Other than this we have collaborated with dozens of Kickstarters during these last two years. Providing models all round to community members in some of the most popular campaign offered in Digital on Kickstarter.\n\nAll Core models have already been created and will be delivered directly after the Kickstarter end, when payment is received. So no waiting more than necessary for your core files. All Stretch Goals have also been completed, but need to be tested and will be available shortly after that.\n\nDIGITAL MEDIA:\nWe strive to produce models that will print with as little support and parts as possible. Some models print in one go whilst most are split up into parts which must be printed separately and then assembled.\n\nThe file format of choice will be .STL and the models shall be zipped and made available to the user for download. The user is responsible for downloading their product and must have a valid internet connection and email with which to collect their reward, via internet download. We will keep the files on our system for at least three months after the first date of issue. The user must ensure that he collects the files within this time frame or risk forfeit. Lovecraft will always try their utmost to ensure that you receive your files and we hope that you enjoy printing them as much as we have enjoyed creating them. If there are any issues please contact support@i-lovecraft.com\n\nBackers must realize that the resolution you obtain on your print is down to the system you use. Our high resolution files will give you almost render quality prints on high end Resin machines, whilst the same files will produce lesser resolution prints on standard FDM printers. At any rate, the files have been previously tested on Resin and FDM printers and have shown satisfactory produce.\n\nWe recommend FDM Prints with at least a 400micron nozzle and 150 micron layer height for terrain. A 100 micron layer height will give you outstanding prints all round.\n\nResin printers should have no problems obtaining excellent resolution and finish, even at 100 micron layer height although 50 micron layer height is recommended for minute sculpt detail clarity. Although miniatures and figurines can be split into smaller parts, large terrain pieces will require a standard 220x220mm print bed, standard for FDM Printers like the 'Ender3'. We do try to restrict the maximum size of models to 180mm sq where possible.\n\nWe supply the user with a design that has been tested on conventional home hobby printers and is proven to print.\n\nAll the models are tested and sliced with 'Cura' software which is freeware and available to all backers for use. We recommend that backers use 'Cura' as it is fully tested with our models and we can offer customer support, if any problems are encountered. We are unable to give customer support for other slicing software and backers use this at their own risk.\n\nAll the files have been checked using Netfab, this means that PrusaSlicer should have no problems slicing these files. Many of the files are also tested using PrusaSlicer.\n\nAll accumulated Grab Bag, Bonus models, also known as Daily Bonus or Free Models are given freely, under no obligation, as is and as a gift and don't form part of the campaign or responsibilities associated with this.\n\nWhen using our digital media, we do not hold ourselves responsible for the production or manufacturing process of the design, this is exclusively up to the user.\n\nUsers may modify models and files at their own risk and only for their own personal use. Modified files are not guaranteed by us and as such, users do this under their own risk and know how.\n\nThe Images shown on the campaign page are just for visualization and although they may come very close, they may not be an exact representation of the final design or printed model, which may vary.\n\nWe reserve the right to alter any of the models shown, at any time, before delivery, with the intent of improving the design, or efficiency of production.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSomething else\nDigital distribution, no impact to the environment", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Super Backer and Add-on", "descp": "Help us by contributing and following this project.

Unravel the dark secrets the island holds as you venture deeper into the caves in search of mystery and treasure.  Len's Island is a blend of peaceful building, farming and crafting, mixed with intense combat, dungeon battles and deep questing and exploration.\nReaching our funding goal will mean we will be able to create Len's Island to the level we are happy with releasing. If we reach further funding milestones, we will be able to use this money to add many additional features, continue expanding the game post-release and overall make the game better and more polished.\nStarting as a solo weekend project just under three years ago, Julian Ball / Flow Graphics created Len's Island as a way to make his own vision for the perfect game come to life. Now developed by a small indie team, development has progressed over the years to form a beautiful, immersive, captivating and meaningful experience which we call Len's Island.\nLen's Island brings excitement and progression for many playstyles, all within a vibrant and engaging world. Catering to the hardcore dungeon-crawler fans, home-builders and decorators, explorers and completionists, farming fanatics, collectable hoarders, and people who just want to live the simple life chopping trees as the sun goes down.\nLen's Island is planned to release late March 2021, on Steam for PC and Mac. With potential plans for other platforms, but you'll just have to wait and see...\nWhy are we on Kickstarter? The short answer is, making games is expensive!! We have been working tirelessly to make this game a reality, some of us for years, some months, all without pay, just with a passion for making a great game. But.. we need some funds to finish this project and let it become the amazing experience we wish it to be.\nLen's Island has been in development for just under three years. The first year was Julian, working alone to get the game into a prototype state and see how it played. Making the prototype was a quest to find a perfect blend of creative building, intense dungeon-crawler action, and calming exploration, all inside of a lush and vibrant world that makes you feel right at home. Now with a small team, we have rewritten the original code and rebuilt the game from the ground up.\nAt this stage of development, we have the core systems built, the starting levels and core design almost finished along with a small library of content. We are in the middle of production, starting the alpha-testing phase and iterating on the content we have so far. The next stage of development is polishing the systems we have in place, filling the game with more content like quests, items, more dungeons, and just generally more fun stuff to explore and do.\nThis is a sneak peek for one of the background tracks. Give it a play, read through the Kickstarter page and imagine you're exploring your own island.\nBuild the home of your dreams. Build wherever you want, make it as big as you want, paint the walls, add some decorations, make it your own.\nWe have developed a building system that functions using an easy drag-n-drop interface, with deep customization and limitless creative freedom to build. Start with the structure using the ever-growing library of building pieces. Then choose what style you want to build in, whether it's basic wooden beams, cobblestone, ornate brickwork or a blend of them all. You can paint and customize styles so you can make it truly YOUR home. Want blue walls, white window-frames and a red door? DONE. Then for the finishing touches. Add some decorations, place your bed, build a wardrobe, a weapon rack, a tool chest, and much much more.\nAfter a treacherous journey into the dungeons or a long day completing a quest, you need a haven to come back to that makes you feel right at home. Our goal for the building in Len's Island was to create a system that allows you to create a home that you can truly be proud of.\nLen's Island is also a fast-paced, skill-driven dungeon crawler with a strong focus on engaging a wide range of combat types and loadout combinations. There are many ways to progress in Len's Island.  If you're getting bored of building your home, tending to your crops and meeting the local townsfolk, there are deep, dark caves below the Island with plenty to explore.\nAs you clear the dungeons you will defeat dark creatures, unlock mysteries, complete challenging puzzles, and better your skills in combat. There's also lots of rare ores to mine, hidden areas to find and broken paths to repair. When you travel deeper into the caves you will start to unravel the mystery of what makes the Island so unique.\nCombat is agile and skill-based with a high skill-ceiling for experienced players wishing for a more nuanced experience. Customize your loadout with over a dozen weapon classes and a wide selection of niche weapons. From wielding magical staffs and iron daggers to fiery war axes and rapid-fire bows. Take your own journey through Len's Island and fight the way you want to fight.\nThese are all work in progress animations and attacks. Player animations and more weapon variants are a couple of the key areas that benefit greatly from Kickstarter. We're not animators so we're doing our best with what we have so far.\nThere's more than one way to make some coin in Len's Island. You can loot the dungeons, complete quests, or gather resources and sell produce grown from your farms. Discover rare fruits, attract new wildlife to your home, make your crops look beautiful and make some good money while doing it. \nUse farms to grow the food which fuels your ventures into the dungeons and long days exploring the Islands; as well as grow exotic plants and flowers to sell back to the villagers for gold.\nGrow large-scale farms throughout the forest, or care for small garden beds on your balcony. Or if you're not the green-thumb type, place some pot plants and call it a day. \nWe will have a lot more farming features to show further as we progress deeper into development. Farming is essential if you want to keep your health topped up and your belly happy. You can also use farming as a great way to earn gold to craft better weapons, upgrade your backpack and buy exotic items.\nQuesting plays an important role within Len's island. Help villagers with simple tasks like gathering some wood for Martinel or take on more dangerous ventures like finding lost loved ones trapped in the dungeons. You can make a big impact within the town and make some nice coin while doing it!\nYou're not the only person who's called this Island home. Rescue villagers, fix up the run-down cabins on the island and help them get back on their feet.\nYou can repair and upgrade more than just your own home. Fix broken bridges leading to hidden treasures, upgrade parts of the local town, and uncover secret areas.\nWhen backing Len's Island you will receive a small demo a few weeks after the successful completion of the Kickstarter. Demo copies will be sent on the 24th of September. This demo will be a little mini-Island that we've created. A place where you can build a house and get a feel for the game. \nWe may look like all fun and games, pun intended, though we have been working tirelessly for years to make this project happen. We all share a common passion, and that is to create games and experiences we care about and are truly proud of.\nOur collective professional background and complementary skills are what makes us a great team. Julian's experience ranges from freelance graphic design and game art, to working within large companies as a marketing director and chief operations officer.  Lars has worked as a professional music composer, sound designer and graphic designer for many years, releasing various self-titled tracks and composing for games such as Team Fortress 2. Martin has lectured in game design and game programming, as well as worked on various indie-game titles over the years.\nKickstarter will help immensely with filling the game with more great content, paying expensive bills that any start-up indie studio has to pay, along with expanding upon our current scope. We can hire an artist to make more weapons, character animations and a variety of visual assets. As well as paying our music composer and SFX designer Lars to continue to create beautiful tracks and much needed audio effects for the game. The vast majority of the money raised will simply go directly back into the game itself to make it that much better, adding more content and a higher level of polish. We will need some of the cash to pay business costs, things like accounting, trademarks, set up fees, software licensing, legal fees, etc. Then if there's any money left over, we can use it for marketing and help pay the bills to make sure none of us ends up homeless while working on Len's Island.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCreating any game has its risks.

Having to keep big publishers happy, or even being forced to change key elements of the game is super risky in our minds. We just want to make the game that we know is great, into a completed and polished title ready for launch.\n\nAll of the funds from Kickstarter have 1 key goal in mind, to make Len's Island the best it can possibly be.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the EU (EU/UK backers), China (Asia backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic Hellscape pledge. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address. Also keep in mind that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose.  \n*Latin America, Africa, and ROW estimates are based on USPS rates. If USPS is not available, these rates may change.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally.

However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays.

Take charge and direct the immune response in this inner quest: Become the hero you need!\"  \nCup of Hygeia (Goddess of health)\n I am a biologist and I have worked on viral evolution for more than 15 years. Around 2010, I started pondering the idea of a cooperative game where you fight a viral infection. At first, I simply wanted to share with people the immense awe I feel when I learn about the beautiful, constant struggle of the immune system. However, several events resolved me to finish it and to strive to give it a wide exposure.    \nMagnification level 1: Human body\nFirst, a beloved friend died of AIDS, when he was only 33 years old. His death was a heartrending blow for me and our tight-knit group of friends, especially because nowadays infection with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus can be treated so easily. He loved board games and I promised myself to finish the game one day and dedicate it to his memory.       \nMagnification level 2: Heart cross section\nSecond, I grew increasingly worried by the rise of misinformation regarding the boon for humanity that vaccination has been. These feelings gave way to a conviction: that a way to inoculate the minds of people against this pernicious idea is to provide an accessible experience that would teach them the basic workings of the immune system.          \nMagnification level 3: Heart tissue\nMost people live their lives unaware of the epic fight between life and death that takes place inside the complex microcosm of their bodies every day. However, I didn't want a dry simulation or lifeless educational tool: I play board games every week and I wanted to create an easy to learn, dynamic and fun experience.       \nMagnification level 4: B-cell, the hero with a thousand trillion faces\nThird, the COVID-19 pandemic brought a sense of urgency to this endeavor. I recoiled at the myriad of misconceptions and I think it is this lack of knowledge that brings panic into many hearts. I know that a board game sounds banal in these trying times, but  the huge awareness caused by the disease has generated unparalleled interest in learning about how the immune system fights a virus.       \nMagnification level 5: Virus\nFinally, I really wish you enjoy playing this game. It would make me very happy to know that at least one person will become a scientist because of this gaming experience: we need more scientists in the world. Along the same lines, for every 20 copies rewarded during this campaign, we will donate 1 copy to a public school or library. I sincerely hope you support us!     \n You can now take \"immune\" for a spin yourself! \nTabletopia link\nGame rules: For a detailed description, please see the game rules, which come in both English and Spanish versions. For more information, resources and discussions, please see our BoardGameGeek page. \nBrief overview:\nComponents and first turn:\nDetailed description of gameplay:\nTurn description: Briefly, each player\u2019s turn consists of three steps: viral replication, energy allocation and immune actions.\nViral replication: The player takes 2 viral tokens from the infection bag and places them on the corresponding organ of the same color. When both tokens go to the same organ, a debilitating disease symptom occurs. \nEnergy allocation: The player can move one energy token to an adjacent action tile: The more energy tokens, the stronger the action is.\nImmune actions: The player can perform two immune actions, out of the 9 available ones. The immune actions allow players to collect necessary resources, maturate their skills and attack the virus on each organ.   \nImmune actions\nEnd of the game: The game continues until either the virus conquers the human body or the immune system learns to recognize the viral strain: the body is now immune.   \nMagnification level 6: An example of some of the amino acids needed to learn to recognize the virus\n\n I hoped to create a game that:\n Was easy to explain. Although I wanted the game to be faithful to the science behind the immune system and thus encourage the player's curiosity, I primarily  wanted a fun and accessible experience. Most of the time we prefer playing games with streamlined rules that are easy to pick up but still provide a meaningful challenge. However, if you wish to play with people without any experience on strategic boardgames, please follow the simplified variant included in the rulebook.\n Was replayable. I like cooperative games because they play differently depending on the group of people. Besides that social aspect, each \"Immune\" session is different with three difficulty levels and a combination of 1 out 16 viral threats (each with its own stats), a subset of the disease symptoms that can come during game play and a random spatial array of the immune actions. \n Was mostly language independent. All action tiles and many cards have iconography to show what they do. Although several cards are written in English, each card's description can be found in the rulebook (which contains both English and Spanish versions). I hope to translate the cards to more languages with the help of the board gaming community. However, if you wish to play a completely language-independent game please follow the simplified variant included in the rulebook.\n Could be played solo. In case of victory, the game provides a score to measure and encourage the player's improvement over time. When you have defeated the highest difficulty, you can increase the viral defense value, which will result in even higher scores.\n Didn't have prescribed roles. Roles are interesting in some cooperative games, but I often find them restrictive: there is a single thing you must do, because it is the best thing you can do. Although each player has a once-per game special ability, there are no different roles in \u201cImmune\u201d: each player in this game specializes as the game progresses. \n Worked at all difficulty levels. After play testing enough the core engine of the game, I searched for the best parameter combos (for example how many disease cards, resource values, etc). Thus, I created a python program (MARVIN) that played the game randomly until victory or defeat. Then the combo's fitness was calculated as how far the average winning rate was from a desired target on each difficulty level. I searched exhaustively over all parameter combos and those that made it into the game were the fittest ones.    \nPlease see the interview below, where these and other topics are discussed: \nThe game will be delivered only to USA, Mexico, Canada, countries in the European union, UK and Australia. The game will be shipped from within the country or region, thus avoiding import fees and taxes. The shipping cost is: \"Inner quest\" - $7, \"Plenty\" - $10 (must ship to the same address). \nAll pledges must be made in full during the campaign, so we wont allow late pledges or pledge upgrades. \nWe estimate that backers will get their rewards on March 2021.\nFor every 20 copies rewarded during this campaign, we will donate 1 copy to a public school or library.     \n Immense thanks to Alice Steel for her artistic contributions: \"Hygeia's cup\", body, organs, tissues, B-cell and the virus.

Who know's there might even be an Artificer and Dungeon master available if we beat these goals!\nThe pins are going for \u00a37 early bird, \u00a38 once we get passed the first 48 hours and then \u00a39 when they find their way onto my Etsy store, so make sure to grab them as soon as you can!\n Pin Specifications\nComes with character sheet backing card\nSoft enamel\nBlack Dye backing (This means we don't have to go pure black on the pin edges)\nTwo black rubber backings to make sure they are really stuck to whatever you attach them too.\n\n\n If you guys really want to help unlock these stretch goals, please share the campaign with your friends on social media! you might have some secret nerd friends you didn't know about! Also to make it easier i'll include two big blue buttons.\nThis project is now our third Kickstarter, All previous works can be found here, on our Etsy page. Our last kickstarter was fully funded in 90 minutes and all stretch goals were unlocked in less than 24 hours! Also we will be working with the same manufacturer that produced our Menagerie of Monsters pins, we trust that they will produce the same high quality product that they did before.\nHow can I choose which pins I would like?\nWhen the campaign ends i will be sending out surveys where you will be able to select which pins you would like! \nWill I get a tracking number?\nMost rewards are sent out untracked due to the high price of tracked shipping here in the UK. If you would like tracking please add \u00a39 to your total pledge amount, as per my pricing list above. \nWill I be able to get these pins after the kickstarter has ended?\nYes! When this campaign ends i will order extra stock encase we have any B grade or none perfect pins, any of the left over pins will be put on my Etsy store, but they will be \u00a39 on there so backers will be getting a discounted price\nOnce you've chosen you're favourite little adventurers or decided to grab all of them, all that's left to do is sit back and relax whilst we get to work. The pin manufacturing process can take several weeks up to a month, depending on the amount of designs that are ordered, but we will be working with the same manufacturer that produced our last kickstarters pins, we trust them to be on time and deliver a high quality product. Then all that's left is assembly and postage, i can assure you i will be taking a couple weeks off of DnD to get all of your orders ready!\n July 20th - Campaign Begins\n August 20th - Campaign Ends\n Mid August - Surveys Sent out\n Last August - Funds arrive and production begins! \n Early October - Pins arrive with me\n Mid October - pins begin shipping\n Late October - All Pins Shipped\nInternational shipping may take an extra week or two\nNow onto the budget\n70% Production\n25% Shipping\n5% Kickstarter Fees", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis isn't my first kickstarter and i have been running an Etsy store for two years now so hopefully everything will run smoothly, the only risk we have falls to the pin manufacturer but i have been speaking to this company for a while and have made sure they can fulfil everything that we need.\nAlso all 12 of my pin designs have been checked by the manufacturer but they are still subject to minor changes like colour and details. If we do have to change anything i will put out an update to all backers. Also i will update you every step of the way!\nYou will only be able to pick from the pins we unlock\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a38 or more", "title": "1 Adventurer Pin", "descp": "One (1) enamel pin of your choice", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["31 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a315 or more", "title": "2 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "Two (2) enamel pins of your choice.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["26 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a321 or more", "title": "3 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "3 enamel pins of your choice", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["16 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a327 or more", "title": "4 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "4 enamel pins of your choice", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["11 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a333 or more", "title": "5 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "5 enamel pins of your choice", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["13 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a339 or more", "title": "6 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "6 enamel pins of your choice", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["8 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a345 or more", "title": "7 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "7 enamel pins of your choice", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a350 or more", "title": "8 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "8 enamel pins of your choice", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a355 or more", "title": "9 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "9 enamel pins of your choice", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a360 or more", "title": "10 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "10 enamel pins of your choice.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a365 or more", "title": "11 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "11 enamel pins of your choice.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a370 or more", "title": "12 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "12 enamel pins of your choice.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a374 or more", "title": "13 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "Thirteen (13) enamel pins of your choice.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a378 or more", "title": "14 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "Fourteen (14) enamel pins of your choice.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["12 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a3110 or more", "title": "20 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "20 enamel pins of your choice.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["3 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a37 or more", "title": "Early Bird -

Players take the role of fantasy heroes: facing challenges, adventuring through the realm of Ulos, and making decisions that change the story \u2014 and the kingdom \u2014 forever.\nAfter a thousand years of peace, Dragul armies raided from the north, prompting you and every other loyal citizen of Nalos to sign up as soldiers of the King\u2019s Guard. The armies of Nalos fought long and hard against the North\u2019s monstrous generals and their minions, finally turning the tide of the Dragul Invasion.\nIn each of the game's 12 storybooks, you\u2019ll be asked to make choices, complete skill checks, and fight battles that will permanently alter the world of Ulos for that adventure and in future adventures. You\u2019ll find new allies, make enemies, and uncover secrets that will change the world around you.\nWhatever choices you make, someone will remember \u2014 and respond.\nChoose from one of 21 pregenerated characters, or import a favorite Roll Player character and take them on a heroic journey. Each character brings unique attributes, starting cards, class abilities, and backstories to your adventure.\nPregenerated Characters\nImporting Characters from Roll Player\nRoll Player Adventures does NOT require the Roll Player base game or any of its expansions to play, though it\u2019s possible to import characters generated in Roll Player using any number of its expansions. Do you have a favorite Obnoxious Saurian Fighter who grew up as a Street Urchin from your last game of Roll Player? Bring them along\nEach of the 17 races and 36 classes have unique portraits and class abilities in Adventures!\nConvert your attribute scores and use them to build dice pools during your adventure!\nEvery market card from Roll Player has a new dice-manipulating counterpart in Roll Player Adventures!\n Note: Roll Player products will be available individually in the pledge manager.\nRoll Player Adventures has 11 adventure books that form a continuous campaign, and 1 infinitely replayable sidequest that can be played at any time. In a session of Roll Player Adventures, you\u2019ll explore a new area of the world of Ulos, represented by a unique adventure map. As your party travels around the map, you\u2019ll read aloud from that adventure\u2019s storybook and choose how you\u2019ll approach each encounter.\nDuring your adventure, you'll encounter strange creatures, solve puzzles and mysteries, and discover new areas of the map to explore.\nRoll Player Adventures blends an immersive branching narrative with cooperative skill checks and combat encounters. These dice placement puzzles echo the satisfying, puzzle-solving features of other Thunderworks Games hits such as Roll Player and Cartographers: A Roll Player Tale. In each combat or skill check, players manage their resources to fill dice slots with dice of specific colors and numbers. With clever play and the players can attempt to overcome the obstacles on the path of adventure.\n\nSpend stamina from your character\u2019s attributes to add specific colors of dice to the dice pool: \nThen play cards from your hand to manipulate the dice and solve the puzzle:\nIf you lose a combat or fail a skill check, there\u2019s no replaying a scenario or rolling up new characters. You now need to deal with the consequences of your failure, and see how the world changes in response. Even death is a new adventure \u2014 with its own 10-encounter storyline.\nRoll Player Adventures has several systems dedicated to remembering the results of your actions. Together, they represent an incredible amount of responsiveness from the game world to player choices. Importantly, these systems also can interact with each other, giving nuance to relationships \u2014 you may choose to gain a temporary ally in an adventure, but be regarded by them differently because you\u2019ve offended their faction in the past.\nAt the end of each adventure, you\u2019ll spend your earned gold and experience points to advance your characters, improving your party for the next adventure. There are 100's of unique abilities to discover and many ways to specialize.\nWant to try Roll Player Adventures for yourself? You can play through a draft of Adventure 1: Battle at Blacklake on both Tabletopia (Free!) and Tabletop Simulator. \n Rahdo Runs Through - Runthrough\nThe Nefras's Judgement expansion is available as part of the Immortal Knight and World of Ulos pledge levels. In this expansion, Nefras, the Snake of Years, will judge each character in your party as they make personal choices that are woven through the storyline of your campaign. Uncover your backstory and choose your alignment in Roll Player Adventures: Nefras\u2019s Judgement.\nDuring a campaign including Nefras's Judgement, each character in your party plays through one unique backstory quest that spans across multiple adventure books.\nFor example, if a character in your party had a \u201cDetective\u201d Backstory, you might slowly uncover clues about a murder, scattered through the adventures in the main campaign, finally either solving the mystery or sending an innocent insectoid to Kulbak prison in the storyline's climax.\nWhen setting up the Nefras\u2019s Judgement expansion at the start of a Roll Player Adventures campaign, players can use the backstory provided with a pregenerated character, or they can import the backstory and alignment from a character built using Roll Player.\nAs with previous projects, we'll be shipping all pledge levels from reputable fulfillment partners around the world. This project is EU, UK, CA, and AU friendly. This means that rewards bound to those regions ship from within their respective regions so backers in those regions will not pay any VAT, customs, or duties on their games upon arrival at their address.

Here's how you play!\nThe Thunderworks team has been working on this project for over three years. The scope is bigger and more ambitious than any project we've done in the past. It's a project born out of love for both narrative adventure games and the passion players have for the other games in the line. We are excited to bring such a big game to you from a small team.\nBut, printing a board game with a scope this large is expensive, and Thunderworks Games is a small company. Without the help of backers on Kickstarter, Roll Player Adventures simply will not exist.\nWe need your support to make this game a reality. The design is complete. The art is complete.

I've outlined some common areas of risk in boardgame projects and how I've done my best to address them.\n\n> Artwork: All the artwork for the game is complete, with the exception of any images added due to achieving stretch goals or any last minute tweaks before sending the final files off to the manufacturer.\n\n>Development: All twelve books of Roll Player Adventures are complete and have been extensively playtested. We are currently playtesting the full campaign with final art and most of its graphic design to make sure everything is just right before we send the game into final layout for manufacturing.\n\n> Component Quality: I've worked with and built a great relationship with one of the best game manufacturers around, Panda Game Manufacturing (www.pandagm.com). Their proven track record on games like Eclipse, Terra Mystica, Pandemic, Belfort, and Mice & Mystics, proves they make great games with a high standard to quality. They've printed all Thunderworks titles to date.\n\n> Delivery Timeline: Unexpected delays out of my control can always occur (i.e. component shortage, manufacturer issues, customs delays, etc...). For the production schedule of Roll Player Adventures, I've used conservative estimates to account for unknowns and bumps in the road.\n\n> Fulfillment: I have received multiple estimates and will be working with established fulfillment companies that have proven track records for delivering quickly and efficiently all over the world.\n\n> Eighth Project: Even though this is my eighth Kickstarter project, I have continued to spend endless hours researching Kickstarter as well as participating in many Kickstarters. I have done my best to foresee and minimize any obstacles or stumbling blocks.\n\nIn addition, in my life outside of this campaign, I have over a decade of project management experience on large-scale software projects.

In order to fully close this case, the Police have now released three items, containing over 90 puzzles and mysteries, and are calling on you to help solve them...\n You can play Full Deck several ways:\nBacking BOOKSHELF, which includes all three books\nBacking ONLOOKER (digital) or CRIME BOARD (physical), which is a self-contained puzzle\nBookshelf \nThree distinct books make up the Full Deck set.\nThis  is a collection of three books, each set inside a crime narrative, where you have to piece together the clues and solve the 90 puzzles contained within.\nThe books consist of:  \nA full-colour textured paperback book\nMasterpiece - Released by the Police, this is a facsimile copy of the serial killer's diary. Read through the diary and see if you can uncover their motivation, plans and other nefarious ideas. The diary is written in broken prose, so you will need to have your most cryptic, riddling minds active to solve the challenges contained within.  \n54 images of crucial evidence to solve the case.\nEvidence - 54 specific items of interest to the Police, from ticket stubs to menu orders and receipts. This is a self-contained puzzle book, as each item also gives clues to a specific playing card value and suit. The items contribute heavily to the storyline, and will give valuable clues to solving the other puzzles.\nThe Evidence book also has answer grids. The Full Deck series uses a brand new answer validation system (BinCheck), so you will not need access to a computer to see if you are correct. This book will be fully printed in colour.\nIf you'd like to have have the actual pieces of evidence, please look at our Crime Board or Expert Reward. \nA full colour, glossy journal.\nRedacted - A facsimile of the journal kept by the investigating Police Officer during the event. The pages have been written in detail, but you will need your powers of deduction (as well as some cross-referencing) in order to work out the information which has been redacted by the Police, for fear of reprisals or lawsuits. This book will be fully printed in colour.   \n Want to play the standalone game, with 54 pieces of facsimile evidence? Dust off your cork board, get your pins ready, and take a look at our Crime Board Reward...\n Crime Board \n54-pieces of facsimile evidence, from tickets stubs to crucial ephemera.\nAlso available is Crime Board. This is a physical collection of all the items of evidence, complete in a genuine evidence bag. Now is your chance to recreate your own crime board, by using these tickets, leaflets, photographs and receipts to build either a timeline of the events, or connect them together as a standalone puzzle.\nCrime Board has a game built into it - each of the 54 items has a playing card suit and value hidden within it, so can be played either on it's own (find all the playing cards), or as part of the Full Deck game (for example, seeking out a name that visited a specific location from one of the pieces of evidence).\nSome of the Crime Board elements in action!\nPlease note that the items in Crime Board are the same as those in the Evidence book, but we believe these add an exciting element to the game, and are perfect for a group of detectives to work through together! Below are some ways backers could play Crime Board:\nThose with books might find the places items are mentioned at or hinted towards, and put them in those sections of the book.\nBlu-tack a deck of cards on the wall, and see if you can place the right item on the right playing card (good for sifting evidence).\n\"Borrow\" a rolling whiteboard from work and create a visual timeline.\nClear the table, and have friends over to sift and sort the clues, uncovering all the puzzles (remember, this is a standalone game, AND can be used with the books).\nReward Options \nFor those on a budget, we are offering a digital-only copy of Evidence. If you love the idea of being your own detective, we are offering Crime Board, which is a physical collection of the evidence, supplied in a genuine evidence bag. For booklovers, you can back to get either the three copies on their own (Bookshelf Pledge), or you can upgrade to the Expert pledge, which includes all three books AND the Crime Board reward. Lastly, we have an extremely limited number of naming rewards available. Please note that these prices are below eventual retail prices.\nBackground\nThis has been created by Stephen, one half of The Escapages, publishers of Escape Books. We have published eight books so far, the most recent one, Flatpak, being successfully funded on Kickstarter in 2019. Flatpak was an interactive puzzle escape book in the guise of a furniture catalogue, and the full-colour print contained over 120 puzzles. \n\"As a lifelong fan of crime fiction and drama, I have always been most interested in the little details; the crime board of evidence, the whiteboard timelines, the little baggies of clues, the serial killer's diary. I felt that there was an extraordinary opportunity to build a pacy narrative simply by using these materials alone. The result is this; an incredibly complex intertwining set of storylines, combined with photorealistic detail and some deliciously-challenging puzzles.\"\nSee Stephen talk about Escapages and the Full Deck project here (18 minute video).\nSolve the riddles within the diary to help crack the case.\nDetails\nHow will the puzzles work?\nThere are three distinct types of puzzle included in Full Deck, outlined below. They are are ordered by difficulty, starting with the easiest.\nEvidence - In this book are photographs of 54 key pieces of evidence from the Full Deck crime story. Contained within each item is a clue or hint toward an ordinary playing card suit and value - including two jokers.\nRedacted - This book is the sleep journal of the investigating Police Officer, which has been check through by the Crown Prosecution Service, and key elements of the story have been redacted. The puzzles within this book rely on you drawing information from the journal itself, and Masterpiece.\nMasterpiece - our killer wrote his plans and thoughts in prose, list, diagrams and poetry. You will have to dig through the book, sometimes linking information from Evidence and Redacted, in order to solve the riddles and puzzles contained within.\nThe journal will guide you, if you can only solve the redacted sections...\nSchedule\nTo avoid any disappointment, we have created a schedule with enough breathing space to allow for any unforeseen minor delays, as outlined below. We aim to complete different milestones ahead of this, but hope that this gives some idea of what we are working toward.\nAugust - October 2020 Completion of the text for Masterpiece and Redacted.\nOctober 2020 Generation of the BinCheck grids. First Play test round.\nNovember 2020 Typesetting of all three books.\nDecember 2020 Printing of proof copies.\nJanuary 2021 Professional copy editing and proofreading. Play testing.\nFebruary 2021 Revisions made. Shipping costs and addresses confirmed.\nMarch 2021 Worldwide dispatch.\n\nStretch Goals\nWe have built two complimentary products for Full Deck - the books, and the crime board set. Below are the stretch goals for them both:\nAs you can see, there are dedicated upgrades for both the books and the crime board. Please bear in mind that if you pledge at EXPERT level, you are contributing to scores for both! If someone backs just the books, that is added to the Bookshelf tally, and so on.\nAt the time of writing, we are already over halfway to our first Stretch Goal for both, so please read below to see how we can achieve this faster than you might expect.\nWe are trying something a little different for this campaign, and asking you to really help get the word out about this project on Social Media. To that end, we have built in a Sharing Stretch range of rewards too!\nAll you have to do is share the above link (bit.ly/BackFullDeck), and we will do the rest. Every validated click counts, and will earn more puzzles for the book set. Plus, if/when we reach 2,000 validated clicks, we will include a customised pin badge for all physical backers!\nIf you have a large fanbase online and would like a customised bit.ly link, please do get in touch via our messages, and we can provide one bespoke for you. Please get in touch for more details.\n\nShipping\nPlease note that shipping is not included in your pledge, and will instead by charged after the campaign using a pledge manager. There will be the option of standard or tracked shipping. Shipping is likely to be around \u00a36 domestically, and \u00a310 internationally, and will be calculated near to dispatch based on current rates and accurate weights.

We want to give back to the 3D Printing Community that has supported our work by offering this project at the most affordable price possible. We love you guys and the support that you have given us over the years. A special thank you to all our backers who supported our last project 'Viking Legends'. We loved your feedback and all the great ideas you came up with for that project. We hope that our little community will contribute in the same way towards this new campaign.    \nAll Core models have already been created and will be delivered directly after the Kickstarter end, when payment is received. So no waiting more than necessary for your core files. Most Stretch Goals have also been completed and will be available shortly after that.\n Accumulated Grab Bag, Bonus models.\nThese models in the grab bag are accumulated during the campaign and feature many of our backer's suggestions. They will be delivered to all our loyal backers who have pledged for any 'All In' tier at the end of the campaign.

All Terrain models print without support and have all been previously test printed.\nMiniatures contain a high level of detail and are mainly meant to be printed in Resin, but can be printed on FDM with supports and preparation work, although it is not recommended.\nThis Project is a limited collectible and is only available as a one time Kickstarter project. The project will not normally be available for online after-sales of digital media. We value our loyal backers in Kickstarter and will continue to offer these products for them on this platform at the best possible price as exclusive collector items.\nIf you missed this Kickstarter, we will be offering part/re-bundled  models from this campaign as add-ons on other similar themed campaigns that we will launch during the year.\nWe work on backer patronage and loyalty and hope we can give back as much as you have given us. We hope you enjoy our future campaign and models.

Other than this we have collaborated with dozens of Kickstarters during these last two years. Providing models all round to community members in some of the most popular campaign offered in Digtal on Kickstarter.\n\nAll Core models have already been created and will be delivered directly after the Kickstarter end, when payment is received. So no waiting more than necessary for your core files. All Stretch Goals have also been completed, but need to be tested and will be available shortly after that.\n\nDIGITAL MEDIA:\nWe strive to produce models that will print with as little support and parts as possible. Some models print in one go whilst most are split up into parts which must be printed separately and then assembled.\n\nThe file format of choice will be .STL and the models shall be zipped and made available to the user for download. The user is responsible for downloading their product and must have a valid internet connection and email with which to collect their reward, via internet download. We will keep the files on our system for at least three months after the first date of issue. The user must ensure that he collects the files within this time frame or risk forfeit. Lovecraft will always try their utmost to ensure that you receive your files and we hope that you enjoy printing them as much as we have enjoyed creating them. If there are any issues please contact support@i-lovecraft.com\n\nBackers must realize that the resolution you obtain on your print is down to the system you use. Our high resolution files will give you almost render quality prints on high end Resin machines, whilst the same files will produce lesser resolution prints on standard FDM printers. At any rate, the files have been previously tested on Resin and FDM printers and have shown satisfactory produce.\n\nWe recommend FDM Prints with at least a 400micron nozzle and 150 micron layer height for terrain. A 100 micron layer height will give you outstanding prints all round.\n\nResin printers should have no problems obtaining excellent resolution and finish, even at 100 micron layer height although 50 micron layer height is recommended for minute sculpt detail clarity. Although miniatures and figurines can be split into smaller parts, large terrain pieces will require a standard 220x220mm print bed, standard for FDM Printers like the 'Ender3'. We do try to restrict the maximum size of models to 180mm sq where possible.\n\nWe supply the user with a design that has been tested on conventional home hobby printers and is proven to print.\n\nAll the models are tested and sliced with 'Cura' software which is freeware and available to all backers for use. We recommend that backers use 'Cura' as it is fully tested with our models and we can offer customer support, if any problems are encountered. We are unable to give customer support for other slicing software and backers use this at their own risk.\n\nAll the files have been checked using Netfab, this means that PrusaSlicer should have no problems slicing these files. Many of the files are also tested using PrusaSlicer.\n\nAll accumulated Grab Bag, Bonus models, also known as Daily Bonus or Free Models are given freely, under no obligation, as is and as a gift and don't form part of the campaign or responsibilities associated with this.\n\nWhen using our digital media, we do not hold ourselves responsible for the production or manufacturing process of the design, this is exclusively up to the user.\n\nUsers may modify models and files at their own risk and only for their own personal use. Modified files are not guaranteed by us and as such, users do this under their own risk and know how.\n\nThe Images shown on the campaign page are just for visualization and although they may come very close, they may not be an exact representation of the final design or printed model, which may vary.\n\nWe reserve the right to alter any of the models shown, at any time, before delivery, with the intent of improving the design, or efficiency of production.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSomething else\nDigital delivery, no impact to the environment.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Super Backer and Add-on", "descp": "Help us by contributing and following this project.

To make sure there are no delays on the creative front, we've decided not to wait until the end of the campaign and we've already hired the illustrator & extra writing staff. If we reach certain stretch goals, there may be additional artwork to produce, but we don\u2019t foresee this causing any delays.\n\n\u2022 Shipping\nWe are planning to begin the shipping process immediately following the end of the campaign.

This is why our biggest pledge for all 13 games offers most of the games to be shipped in one box. This way we majorly reduce the chances of one of your 13 envelopes to be lost, damaged, or delayed when sent as a letter mail.\nPlease note that if you're outside of US & Canada and you add the \"Almost Subscription\" add-on that offers all your 13 envelopes to be shipped separately, the shipping will be considered to be \u201cat your own risk\u201d, meaning we cannot be responsible for mishandled packages.\nAny issues with delivery will be handled individually and in-house. We're prepared to send replacements when it makes sense.\n\n\u2022 Additional Fees & Customs\nOne of the reasons we're heavily subsidizing our shipping costs is because VAT, customs, or other local shipping fees are unfortunately not covered and processed on our end. We currently have only twenty EU & Asian backers, so we are prepared to serve you personally and case by case.\nTo be more accessible for International backers of all 13 games, we added the \"Almost Subscription\" add-on that offers all your 13 envelopes to be shipped as letter mail, not in a box. According to our research, letter mail is exempt from VAT in most countries, so we're hoping this option will help you save some $.\n\n\u2022 Refunds\nAs of launch, we haven't found any pledge managers for post-campaign processing we're happy with, so we'll be handling everything in-house.\nYou are welcome to manage your pledge during the campaign (we really hope that 40 days are enough for you to make a final decision and we will make sure to send an update 48/24h before the end of the campaign to remind you to manage your pledge.) Once the campaign ends, we will send out final surveys and we will start the shipping process immediately. Once your order has been processed for shipping, we will no longer be able to offer refunds. \n\n\u2022 Unforeseen Events\nWhile we can't anticipate everything, we feel that we are prepared to deal with all the issues if and when they occur. We are committed to you all and will always keep you updated about any changes that might affect this project. We respect our backers and we have a moral obligation to ensure everyone receives what they pledged for. By pledging to this project, you are indicating that you understand and give consent to the risks, challenges, and pledge terms laid out above.

Click the big button at the very top of the page to get connected.  It might put you on our mailing list for when we announce it, or bring you right to the Backerkit late-pledge store, depending on timing.    That button is your key to unlocking the Mystery!\nThank you for your interest in Gate Keeper Games and our dice!\nLet\u2019s unlock the Mystery!\nALL STRETCH GOALS UNLOCKED!\nThere are currently...\n50 brand new dice sets unlocked (pic & details below)\n7 Weird Stuff unlocked (pic & details below)\n5 d2s unlocked (pics & details below)\nUK & EU VAT Friendly Shipping (details below)\nA free shipping box upgrade! (details below) \n\nWhat are Mystery Dice?\nOver the last 7 years I've produced over 90 custom dice designs.  I'm really proud of that work.  But my supporters have put a bug in me: They want me to make All The Things!  ...now I do too.\nSo here's the plan.  We set a funding goal of $25,000 together.  That allows us, you and me, to make 10 totally new dice designs.  Never before seen things.  Insane quality designs, even better than you know to expect from me. \nBut that's all I'm gonna tell you!\nHow's it work?\nYou pledge for dice sets at an immense discount, and we make and ship them to you as a \"Mystery Set\".  Meaning we don't tell you what you're getting, you find out ...when you open the box!\nEndless surprises await as every set you add to your pledge is guaranteed to be unique, with no repeats unless you ask for them.  It's going to be an unboxing experience like no other!\nWhat might we make?\nThere might be new molds, new sizes, new colors, new patterns, opaque and transparent.  There might be sparkles, neon, glow in the dark, layers and swirls, inclusions... or maybe even all of the above at once! \nAnything goes!  We're putting no limits on ourselves! \nI promise this: \nAll 7-die and 11-die sets will be the polyhedral shapes you expect, and they'll have the numbers you expect.  All the rest...?  That's where the fun happens!\n Our first 10 sets are out of Dice Jail, and ready to be added to your pledge!\nAt funding, $25,000, we released ten (10) sets for your enjoyment.\nThen, every $5,000 in funding past the initial funding goal we've unlocked another set for \"as long as that model holds\".  That is: 11 sets at $30,000, 12 sets at $35,000, etc. All the way up through 25 sets unlocked at $100,000.  Now that we're at 25 sets, 2d2s, and 4 Weird Stuff that model needs to be adjusted slightly.\nNow, every $10,000... in funding past $100,000 in funding we'll unlock yet another set until the end of the campaign.\nALL STRETCH GOALS UNLOCKED!\nTo keep things simple, we'll have one ever-changing \"Stretch Goal\" image below.\nTotal Sets Unlocked: 50! The final total! Everything's unlocked!!! : D\n\n\nVia your awesome support you have more than QUADRUPLED the original set quantity release!  That is truly awesome.  There are no chains on the options.  Let's make \"all the things\"!\n7-Die and 11-Die Sets*\nAll unlocked sets above will be available as 7-die and 11-die set options, with standard numerals for normal play.\n7-die sets: $9 per set.  (40% off average MSRP of $15)\nEach 7-die set contains: 1d4, 1d6, 1d8, 1d10, 1d%, 1d12, and 1d20.\n  11-die sets: $14 per set.  (40% off average MSRP of $23)\nEach 11-die set contains: 1d4, 4d6, 1d8, 1d10, 1d%, 1d12, and 2d20.\n  The 3 extra d6 are great for all your backstabbery needs, and the extra d20 is perfect for Advantage/Disadvantage.\n  *We reserve the right to add free stuff to any dice set at any time.  - We've already applied free upgrades to 4 different sets.  More are likely.\nPlus we've got: Weird Stuff! \nYup, we've got Weird Stuff too!\nWe made the first one available at funding, and through Daily Puzzle Challenge submissions we've unlocked more!\nTo keep things simple here too, we'll have one ever-changing \"Weird Stuff\" unlock image below.\nTotal Weird Stuff Unlocked: 7!\n\nWait... \"Weird Stuff\"!?\nNot everything we want to do fits the traditional mold.  Literally and figuratively.  Therefore, in addition to the main unlocked sets, we'll occasionally add a totally new, totally different \"Weird Stuff\" option to the campaign.  \nAdd a \"Weird Stuff\" item to any pledge tier for: $24 each.  At funding there was only one, but now there's more, and we'll unlock even more still as we go!  Therefore the same No-Duplicates guarantee applies when you add more than 1 to your pledge.\nWhat will they be like?\nWeird.  I promise one thing and one thing only: They'll technically count as 'dice' and be well worth your money.  Beyond that, anything goes here!\nThey may or may not be: extra large or small sizes, over-full sets, special single dice, new materials, unusual numerals, odd molds, and all manner of chaos.\nWe're giving away zero other details here. : )\nLet me be clear: you do not want to miss these! \nNew Weird Stuff will unlock and be added as often as we think is good.  Sometimes with Daily Puzzle submissions (a community building must-see below), sometimes with funding, sometimes because I had a cool idea.  : ) They'll never take away from normal set unlocks above.\nPlus! For breaking $300,000:\nI'm going to upgrade the shipping box.  It's small little thing I've got in mind, especially as compared to the bajillion sets of dice inside of it, but I believe it'll increase your pleasure in even receiving your box ...and that for me is reason enough to do it.  \n\"What is it?\"  ...It's a Mystery! : )\nAlways loving to work together with others in this great gaming community, we invited the following people / organizations to Guest Design a Mystery Set.  It's our way of bringing people together.  Their brains design it, our hands make it.  Honestly, it's a lot of fun!\nWe've unlocked ALL of the Guest Designer Dice!  \nTen traditional sets, and two \"Weird Stuff\" from Jamey Stegmaier and Norse Foundry! \nNewest Addition: YOU!  We've named you, the Kickstarter Backers, the final Guest Designer on the campaign!  Post your suggestion in the comments.  Vote up suggestions by commenting on them.  From the top 10 ideas chosen by you, I'll secretly select the final winner at the close of the campaign!  \nGuest designers were given free reign to design a set as they see fit, with no real design limitations.\nThe following guidelines were given: It must be a new set nobody's ever done before in design and/or colors, it must have standard numerals on all faces*, and you can't tell anyone what it looks like till it ships.  ...naturally.\n*We have allowed the two dice groups, if they want to, to put their group's symbol/logo on the d20 and/or d6 (not all have accepted or even decided).  We leave it to them.\nWe only have one add on option, and that's our all new custom d2 design, created just for this campaign.  During the course of the campaign, we will unlock additional d2 coins as add ons.\nThere are currently: FIVE designs available...\nFirst d2 Option:\n#1) You may add the Campaign-Exclusive \"Mystery Die d2\" to any Pledge Tier for only $2/per. No limit.\nSize: Approx 25mm across, 5mm thick.\nRenders shown. Final design may vary.\nNew D2 Option! \nUnlocked for Making this the best GKG Campaign of all time!\n#2) You may add the Campaign-Exclusive \"Best Kickstarter Ever d2\" to any Pledge Tier for only $2/per. No limit.\nRender Shown. Final design may vary.\n\n3rd D2 Option!\nUnlocked for submitting 1750 correct puzzle submissions!\n#3) You may add the \"Decision Maker\" to your pledge for only $2/per.  No limit.\nColor Scheme chosen by the backers: \"Blazing Red and Free as the Sky Blue\"\nRender Shown. Final design may vary.\n4th D2 Option!\nUnlocked because you're awesome!\n#4) The \"Sun & Moon\" d2!  You are welcome to add \"Sun & Moon\" d2s to your pledge for only $2/per.  No limit.\nPossible uses for the Sun & Moon d2:\nDay or Night\nLight or Darkness\nGood Effect or Bad Effect\nGood Mood or Bad Mood (for random NPCs encountered)\nYes or No\nWin or Lose\nLife or Death\nFinal D2 Option!\n\"The Gate Keeper\"\n#5) Added on the final day to celebrate how amazing you all are.  This coin will likely become the icon of the GKG d2 line, and you'll be the first to own one.  Featuring our GKG invented color (sorta, but yes, but not really, buy heck yes), 'Power Teal'.   You are welcome to add \"The Gate Keeper\" d2s to your pledge for only $2/per.  No limit.\nRender Shown. Final design may vary.\nWe've got just two Pledge Tiers: \n The Grab Bag, for 7-die sets\n The Mystery Box, for 11-die sets\nPledging is easy!\nWant 7-die sets?  Choose \"The Grab Bag\" and pledge $9 for each 7-die set you want.\nWant 11-die sets?  Choose \"The Mystery Box\" and pledge $14 for each 11-die set you want.\nWant to add the Weird Stuff?  Simply add $24 for each Weird Stuff option you want, to ANY pledge tier.  Yes, you may add multiples/duplicates.\nWant to add special d2s?  Simply add $2 for each d2 you want, to ANY pledge tier.  Yes, you may add multiples/duplicates.  \nWeird Stuff and D2s do not count toward free shipping but will be included in free shipping if you have 3 or more normal sets in your pledge.\nMix and Match?\nYes, you can mix-and-match adding 7-die or 11-die sets along with Weird Stuff and d2s to ANY pledge tier, as freely as you like by pledging for the correct totals.  We'll clarify exactly what your pledge value is for in Backerkit during Pledge Management.\nNO DUPLICATE GUARANTEE:\nAll sets in your order will be unique; there will be no repeat/duplicate sets in your order.  So if you want all of them you are guaranteed all of them if you pledge for all of them.  If you DO want duplicates, you can A) Ask for them in Backerkit, or B) Pledge for more total sets than are offered.\n Wait, are you not going to show us the dice...? \nNaturally, because this is a Mystery Dice Campaign, to show you the sets would remove the Mystery!  Dice included will not be revealed until they ship to you this fall. But we're so confident in our quality, that we guarantee you'll like them!

FREE DICE! - I'm going to choose 3 sets, one will get +1d4, one will get +1d6, and and one will get +1d8.  I figure this will help Monks, Rogues, and Paladins respectively!  Thus the 7-die set of that type will become an 8-die set for free, and the 11-die set just became a 12-die set!  Maybe you'll get lucky and fetch one of these sets in your glorious Unboxing!  ...I told you \"I reserve the right to add free stuff to any set at any time\", didn't I?\n 1000 submitted correct answers: Now Unlocked! - A new \"Weird Stuff\" Guest Designed by our friends at Norse Foundry!  The theme is still TBD, but we'll let you know as soon as we do!\n 1750 submitted correct answers: Now Unlocked! - The ultimate d2 with it's colors selected by the community \"The Decision Maker\".  Now found in the Add-Ons section above.\n 2500 submitted correct answers: Now Unlocked! - A new Weird Stuff has be added as our final Puzzle Submission unlock!\nWe believe in our dice, and we believe in you.  We stand by everything on this campaign with the following 3 guarantees.\nGuarantee #1) No Duplicates: There will be no repeat sets in your order unless you specifically ask for them or if you pledge for more sets than we've unlocked.\nGuarantee #2) Quality Promise: After receiving your Mystery Dice, we're going to give you 14 whole days to play with them, and play with them you should! If you discover any quality issues, what-so-ever, we'll gladly replace your set or give you your money back, 100%.  Quality promise applies to all reward items; and \"Quality promise\" shipping is on us.\nGuarantee #3) Like Em, or Send Em Back: (LEOSEB) We're going to try new things, but have no intention of making ugly dice.  We're so certain they'll be gorgeous that if after receiving your Mystery Dice if you actually don't like them, for personal aesthetic reasons, we'll allow you to send sets back to us for a free Mystery replacement.  LEOSEB applies to normal sets only (7-die & 11-die), but due to the inherent weirdness-factor of Weird Stuff it does not apply to those items, or any d2 add ons.  To ensure this is a promise we can keep, all LEOSEB shipping will be the responsibility of the backer.  \nShipping should be simple, and the unboxing experience should be exciting!\nIt's flat rate.  No guessing, no games.  We're covering all weight upgrade costs for you world-wide. \nWe're offering to pay for your shipping in the USA.  Doesn't get easier than \"Free\". : )\nWe're covering all VAT charged in the UK, EU, and Canada.  Doesn't get any better than duty-free!\nVAT pre-paid and shipped directly to your door! No customs, no fees. I'm going to cover them for you personally.\nShipping fees, where applicable, will be collected after the campaign during Pledge Management in Backerkit. Note: Currently, Kickstarter has applied a $15 shipping fee for ALL international backers at the time of pledging. We've been working with Kickstarter to help us resolve it but they're unable to help.  Please know that this is ok, and we'll get it sorted in the Backerkit. For backers in the EU and \"Worldwide\" the small price difference will be collected after the campaign in the pledge manager.\nFor additional details on EU shipping, and a cost break down, I welcome you to please check out the FAQ tab.  Thank you.\nPlease note, to ensure our \"no duplicates\" policy is correctly applied, that our \"Like em or Send em Back\" policy can rightly occur, and to be able to offer Free Shipping in the USA, most fulfillment will be handled in house by me personally!  : )  In the UK and EU we'll be shipping from inside so that you don't have any VAT or import fees!\nBeyond these locations some countries may be responsible for customs or import fees.  You can calculate the estimated fees for your country here.  Import fees are usually 8%-20% of your total pledge value, while some countries do not charge fees for \"toys & games\" which our dice count as.  We believe our exceptional dice and shipping costs should help to offset some customs fees.  -  You are our first priority!\nBrought to you by:\n\"These are your dice!\"", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRISK: You won't trust me.\n\nThoughts on Risk: You're going to have to decide this one for yourself, but to help, please know this: I've been in this business for 7 years, and this is Gate Keeper Games' 16th Kickstarter campaign with over 90 Gate Keeper Games & Dice exclusive sets under my belt so far. I've shipped every reward and kept every promise along the way. Your pledge will receive the same hands-on care and concern as every one that has come before you.\n\nRISK: You fear you might not like what you get.\n\nThoughts on Risk: See, that's kind of the fun of it.

UPDATE: Because we have hit a stretch goal, Kickstarter backers at the Junior Alchemist and up level will receive a 2nd refill kit. More on the refill kit below.   \nIt would mean so much to us if you would help us reach our funding goal by pledging for a copy of the game! We do also understand that everyone\u2019s circumstances are different in these uncertain times. As long as supplies last, Patron and Apprentice backers will be able to upgrade their pledge at a later date when things are hopefully more certain.    \nUPDATE: The enamel pin poll is open in update #8. Because we reached our $150k stretch goal, the winner of the poll will be included for Junior Alchemist backers, and BOTH pins will be included in the Apprentice Pack! \nJoin us for puzzles throughout the campaign! \nThe story of The Emerald Flame revolves around working with the Koschei Historical Society to analyze a legendary alchemist\u2019s work\u2026 but The Koschei Society first needs your help to find that work! You are being invited to join the investigation at its earliest stages and help them follow a series of clues that will hopefully lead to the location of the alchemist\u2019s hiding spot.   \nWe expect to find 5 artifacts, one of which will be posted on the Koschei Society forum every Wednesday evening, before being shared publicly on Thursdays in our campaign updates and on social media. You can join the forum to see the puzzles early and/or to solve them with others as a group!\nTo join the forum, find the two words hidden somewhere on this Kickstarter page. One will complete this link www.koscheisociety.org/__________ (10 letters) and the other will give you a 5-letter password (enter in lowercase) to access the page. Regardless of whether or not you join the forum, any backer who submits all 5 correct answers before the end of the campaign will be entered to win a special art prize! You can submit your answers at www.koscheisociety.org/submit.\nIf you're having trouble figuring out the password, take a look at the banner below and see if a tilt in perspective helps. :)   \nNow that we have hit our funding goal, we\u2019ve got lots of great stretch goals for The Emerald Flame, including upgraded components and additional items! You can help us reach them by sharing the project on social media - the more people we can get it out to, the more we can unlock all sorts of goodies! \n Share the project and follow at the links below! \nPostCurious Website\nFacebook\nInstagram\nTwitter\nBoard Game Geek\nAlways another puzzle! With The Emerald Flame in your hands you can discover 3 secret messages hiding in the box artwork.\nAbout the refill kit: Now that we have hit our first stretch goal, the refill kit will include one set of replacements for the non-reusable components, should you want to repackage and pass the game on to someone else. PDFs will be also be provided for the paper components in case extras are needed or if you are playing with a friend remotely. One of our next stretch goals is an additional copy of the refill kit, which would mean a total of 3 possible play-throughs of the game.    \nRest assured we did our best to find the most reliable and affordable shipping options we could, and are also subsidizing shipping to all regions by $3 USD. Please note that the chart below shows shipping estimates, and shipping will be charged after the campaign using a pledge manager. Depending on your location and postage prices at the time of fulfillment, it may be necessary to adjust the shipping cost by a small amount.   \n**Rest of the world disclaimer: We are willing to ship worldwide, but please note that countries not listed in the shipping chart above will be considered \u201cship at your own risk\u201d areas, meaning we cannot be held responsible for mishandled packages. COVID-19 guidelines have also forced the USPS to temporarily suspend shipping to certain countries around the world. We do not know when these restrictions will be lifted, and it\u2019s very possible this won\u2019t be relevant by the time rewards are shipped out, but for the time being we will not be able to ship to the countries on this list.\nTo streamline the process as much as possible and offer more affordable shipping to international backers, we plan to warehouse in the US and UK, partnering with Quartermaster Logistics for backers in the Americas, Oceania, and Asia, and GamesQuest for backers in the UK and Europe. Please note that while we are offering customs friendly shipping to USA, Canada, UK, EU, Australia, New Zealand, & China backers, we cannot be responsible for VAT or customs charges incurred outside of these regions. \nPlay The Emerald Flame in your language: The majority of puzzles in The Emerald Flame do not depend on language and the few that do require only a very basic understanding of English. To make The Emerald Flame more accessible to a global audience, we currently plan to translate all the text in the game to make playing in Spanish, German, and French as easy as possible. Players will be able to download a free PDF and read all the clues and letters in their chosen language while using the physical components to solve the puzzles. For other language requests feel free to reach out to us and if there is significant demand we will look into the possibility.\nJuega a The Emerald Flame (La llama esmeralda) en tu propio idioma: La resoluci\u00f3n de la mayor\u00eda de los acertijos de Emerald Flame no depende del idioma, y los pocos en los que es necesario basta con unas nociones b\u00e1sicas de ingl\u00e9s.

If everything goes according to plan we should be able to deliver MUCH SOONER than what is shown on this schedule, but due to the complexity of manufacturing this game and the current global circumstances, we are being overly cautious with our promised ship dates in case we encounter any unexpected delays.\nDesign and development - May 2018 - March 2020\nKickstarter campaign - May - June 2020\nKickstarter funds deposited, format files for printing - July 2020\nSampling and production - August 2020 - May 2021\nDelivery of The Emerald Flame & standard reward tiers - Aug 2021\nDelivery of Collector\u2019s Edition reward tiers - Sept 2021\nPlease note that due to the personalized nature of the Collector\u2019s Edition, delivery for these tiers will come shortly after the standard version. We hope you\u2019ll understand these will require a little extra time to get the special attention they deserve. \nWe want to be as transparent as possible with our funding. Although there have been many costs incurred throughout the development of the project, our funding goal includes only what we need to make the game and deliver it to you.

After working in the escape room industry, she was inspired to create her first game, The Tale of Ord, by her love of nature, mythology, and the journey of discovery that can be created through puzzles and gamified storytelling. The Emerald Flame follows this inspiration, and after nearly two years of development and meticulous crafting, Rita can\u2019t be more excited to finally bring it to Kickstarter and share it with the world. \nPLAY\n\nRita holds a BFA in Furniture Design from the Rhode Island School of Design and loves talking to other creators about making things.

These will be done immediately after the Kickstarter campaign ends while we wait for the funds so there should be no delays on the creative front. If we reach certain stretch goals, there may be some additional artwork to produce, but we don\u2019t foresee this causing any delay as it can be completed during the sampling phase.\n\nManufacturing \n\nThis will be PostCurious\u2019 first time working with a manufacturer, which comes with its own challenges. The Emerald Flame is a complex game to produce, so sampling with the factory may take some time. The production copy will be fully inspected by us to make sure everything looks and works the way it should. Please note that due to material availability and manufacturing processes, some components may appear different than shown in the prototype images. As with any project that has complex custom components, there is also a risk of changes or delays, which is why we\u2019ve factored in extra time for manufacturing. We want to make sure the game is perfect for all our backers, and will always keep you updated in case of any changes.\n\nShipping & Fulfillment\n\nDelivering hundreds of games around the world is not an easy task, and there are many potential factors that could cause delays. We\u2019ll be partnering with Quartermaster Logistics for backers in the Americas, Australia, and Asia, and GamesQuest for backers in the UK and Europe. Both companies are experts in the field and we have full confidence in their ability to troubleshoot whatever obstacles may arise. Please note that while we guarantee customs friendly shipping to USA, Canada, UK, EU, AU, NZ & China backers, we cannot be responsible for VAT or customs charges incurred outside of these regions. Please also note that shipping will be charged after the campaign, and the numbers shown in the shipping chart are estimates only.\n\nCountries not listed in the chart of the \u201cshipping\u201d section above on this page are considered to be \u201cship at your own risk\u201d areas, meaning we cannot be responsible for mishandled packages in those regions. It is unclear how Brexit will affect shipping into the EU, but we\u2019ve been assured by GamesQuest that there are contingency plans in place should the outcome create obstacles in fulfillment. We do not expect this to affect anyone\u2019s rewards, but we will keep you posted if any changes occur. \n\nUnforeseen Events\n\nThroughout this process there is always a large number of variables at play, and many factors that could cause delays or changes. This could include severe weather, a global pandemic, or other unexpected circumstances. It is impossible to predict the outcome of such events or how they might affect the production of this project, but we will do everything we reasonably can to make sure the rewards are produced and delivered as promised. We are 100% committed to our backers and will always be sure to notify you with any changes that might affect this project\u2019s content, timeline, shipping, or otherwise. \n\nRefunds \n\nRefund requests received within 14 days of the end of the Kickstarter will be honored in full. Refunds requested after two weeks have passed will be subject to a 15-20% cancellation fee due to Kickstarter fees and administrative expenses. Once your order has been processed for shipping, we will no longer be able to offer refunds. Please note that anyone who does not complete the pledge manager by our required deadlines will not be eligible for a refund, and may encounter delays in receiving their rewards. \n\nBy pledging to this project you are indicating that you understand and give consent to the risks, challenges, and pledge terms laid out above.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Watchful Eye", "descp": "Just curious?

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal or Stripe. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more promo goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the EU (EU/UK backers), China (Asia backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic pledge, with 1 or 3 comics and their related promos. Estimates for 2 comics will fall in the price range between the 1-3 estimates. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address. Also keep in mind that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose.\n*Latin America, Africa, and ROW estimates are based on USPS rates. If USPS is not available, these rates may change.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Afghanistan. \nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.  \nTo learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 44th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as:\nProduction delays\nShipping delays\nCustoms delays \n\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is February 2021, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card. This project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. All \u201cNo Reward\u201d pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms please do not pledge on this project, but instead wait for the retail release.\n\nTo make sure you have the best gaming experience, all CMON products are warrantied against manufacturing defects for 2 years from the of date purchase from CMON (proof of purchase required).

Together as a team you must collect a certain number of gems, reach the exit and Escape, all before the temple collapses, and the game ends.\nEach player explores their temple by entering chambers and gaining bonus actions and gems for the whole team. The special colored chambers require players to work together. They must occupy both chambers of the same color, in the same round to unlock two gems at once. A daunting task but worth it!\nPlayers can select from different difficulty levels and variants to tailor the game to their group. Cooperation, communication, and a bit of luck rolling the dice is needed to gain the required number of gems and reach the exit before the time runs out.\nThe setup of the game is very easy. One adventure sheet is placed in the middle, and depending on the difficulty level, the goal on the gem track is marked. Each player takes a temple sheet, an adventurer, and a pen. A start player is determined and takes 8 dice. Then each player chooses a different direction from which they want to enter the temple. Done!\nGame round\nA round is played in clockwise direction beginning with the start player. The active player takes all uncursed dice, rolling them two at a time until all are rolled. After each roll they must decide if they want to keep the rolled symbols or place them in the common pool. But if a black mask is rolled, it is placed on the adventure sheet. These dice are cursed and locked from being rolled for three turns.\nThe active player's goal is to enter chambers on their temple sheet, collecting gems, and bonus actions. They can move their adventurer to adjacent chambers if they have the required symbols. In each chamber they gain the bonus depicted, which is then crossed out and transferred to the adventure sheet. \nOnce the active player has used all their dice, or cannot use any more, the other players divide the dice in the common pool among them. With these dice they try to fulfill the treasure maps on their temple sheet. A treasure map is complete if they cross out all the required symbols, gaining a gem, and a bonus action for the whole team that is recorded on the adventure sheet.\nThe adventure sheet keeps track of the collected gems, game rounds, bonus actions (available and used), as well as locked dice (black masks). Available bonus actions (a box with a circle) can be used by the active player to move around their temple. If an action is used it is then crossed out. \n Overview of the bonus actions: \nWhen players have collected the required number of gems, it is time to run for the exit in the center room of the temple. Everybody has to be in that chamber before the end of the final round in order to Escape!\nEscape Roll & Write offers lots of replay-ability with various difficulty levels to tackle, and two different temple/adventure layouts to explore! \nThe dice shrine chambers can be used with the Escape base game, offering additional challenges.  These chambers are exclusive to Queen Games.  They are available from this Kickstarter, and if there are any left in the production run, we will sell them at Fairs/Conventions, or via our webstore.  \nTo play with the new shrine chambers, 8 dice from the Roll & Write are required. Once a chamber is discovered two dice are rolled and placed on the shrines. Adventurers who enter the chamber can roll the needed icons to get either a gem, or one of 4 different special effects. The die is then removed to indicate it has been used. These chambers can also be played with any combination of expansions or Queenies.\nEscape Queenie Box: 11 - 16\nAll Queenies that were released after the Escape Big Box 2nd Edition in one convenient box!\n11 \u2013 The Cursed Gems\n12 \u2013 The Slide\n13 \u2013 The Map\n14 \u2013 The Wishing Well\n15 \u2013 New Quests\n16 \u2013 New Traps\nWith this and the Big Box, players will have everything that is available for Escape. \nThe Escape Queenie Box is also a great addition for players who only own the base game and want new modules to add to their adventures.\nQueenie 11: The Cursed Gems is already included in the Big Box, but is such a popular Queenie that we wanted to include it for all players to enjoy.\nQueenie 11: The Cursed Gems\nAdventurers beware! You are in possession of a cursed gem and must find the matching gem inside the temple, or you cannot escape. You and your fellow adventurers must search the temple for matching gems and get rid of them. This Queenie adds another challenging layer and is, therefore, for experienced players.\nQueenie 12: Slide\nThis Queenie comes with two chambers and a curse. The slide chamber is a tricky one, because you can enter it for free from the staircase side. But if you want to enter the chamber from the other side, you have to roll 3 torches. So you better be sure before using the slide too often.\nThe debris chamber is interesting since in order to discover this chamber a player not only has to roll two adventurer icons but also a key and a torch.\nAnd finally, the Cyclops curse makes you cover one of your eyes with your hand and leave it there until the curse is lifted. Sounds easy, but rolling with one hand and moving your adventurer with limited vision is very tricky!\nQueenie 13: Map\nThe map chamber is a great destination for players since it is one of the few chambers that actually help the players and make the escape a little bit easier. Inside the chamber a player can roll 2 torch icons and then place their adventurer in any chamber they want, allowing the player to quickly navigate the temple and help other players.\nQueenie 14: Wishing Well\nThis chamber also helps the players succeed. If you roll 2 key icons, you may either draw a treasure, get rid of a curse, or regain one of your lost dice! And you can use the wishing well multiple times... But only one wish at a time, so you have to leave the chamber and reenter if you want to use it more than once\nQueenie 15: New Quests\nNow players must fulfill quests, which are special chambers, where they have to work together to overcome a challenge, otherwise they cannot escape. Each game players can decide if they want to tackle one, two or even three quest chambers.\nQueenie 16: New Traps\nTrap chambers are especially nasty since the adventurer must be placed inside the chamber upon discovery. Now they are trapped until they figure a way out or another adventurer helps them. There are 3 trap chambers in this Queenie. How many are you prepared to handle in your next game?\nAdd-Ons \nFor backers who may have missed our recent campaigns or planned on getting the games at the Gen Con 2020 or Spiel 2020 (unfortunately neither of which will take place this year). We would like offer another opportunity to get Winter Kingdom here in this campaign, and Merlin Big Box, among others, in the pledge manager.\nPledging for this Campaign\nProduction for this campaign is planned for Q4  2020.  To ensure that shipping goes as smoothly as possible we are using Crowd Ox Pledge Manager.   \nEscape Base Game\nEscape: The Curse of the Temple is a real-time cooperative game in which all players must escape from a temple after awakening an ancient curse. The game plays in precisely 10 minutes, with an included soundtrack (also available digitally) counting down the game. Players must navigate through the temple by rolling dice and matching symbols to rooms, thereby gaining entry and visibility into adjacent rooms. The map of the temple will unfold as the players explore, making every game play different.  At certain points a countdown starts, and if players aren't back in the safe room when time is up, they will become \"lost\" and lose one of their dice. \nBig Box 2nd Edition\nMore content means more challenges to overcome. The Big Box includes the Base Game, 8 Expansion modules (originally released as three expansion boxes) and 10 Queenies (single expansion modules):\nModule 1: Curses\nModule 2: Treasures\nModule 3: Illusion chambers\nModule 4: Special chambers\nModule 5: Quest chambers\nModule 6: Characters\nModule 7: Trap chambers\nModule 8: Time chambers\nTen (10) Queenies. See the graphic for the names of each\nProduction and Delivery\nThe production of Escape Roll & Write as well as Escape Base Game and Escape Big Box 2nd Edition is planned for the end of October 2020. Our games are printed in Europe, so there is little delay between the end of printing and them arriving for fulfillment in our warehouse.

We guarantee that the product you receive will be complete and all internal components in perfect condition. We will do our best to ensure that your package arrives in good condition, but all decisions on box replacements will be made on a case by case basis. Due to the difficulty and expense in replacing boxes, depending on your region, we will not be able to replace some boxes with minor cosmetic damage only.\nRETURNED PRODUCTS If you refuse to accept your package on arrival we will not issue you a refund for the cost of the pledge.\nFAILURE TO RESPOND TO SURVEY We will send a survey out to backers to collect addresses.

They will be available at the same discounted price.\nShipping cost: Shipping cost will be a flat fee of 7\u20ac and will not change even if you take more handles, caps, wet palettes, brushes, etc...   No additional shipping costs!\nProduction and delay update: we are on track with production, and are confident to start shipping in July as planned.\n\nAdditional painting books from Angel Giraldez: when you spend, on KS and/or the pledgemanager, more than 60\u20ac of products, you will get a second copy of the book from Angel Giraldez!\nAdditional metal docking plates: each RGG360\u00b0 comes with a metal docking plate. However, for those who want more, you will be able to order a 3x plates pack!\nSo why improve the RGG 360\u00b0 miniature handle? Because the additional features make it the most user-friendly holder for miniature painting. \nWhat's new?\n Swappable cap: You can now paint multiple miniatures with just one holder (additional caps sold separately).\n Magnetic dock: Secure your WIP miniature thanks to the magnet inside the holder. \nLoaded with cool features!\n Ergonomic handle to stay focused and to hold your miniature naturally without causing hand fatigue.\n 360\u00b0 rotation to offer more control and help you achieve a better painting at every angle. Effortlessly!\n Stick them all! Round, square, small, large, exotic bases\u202610 to 50mm you can stick them all.\n Reviewers and thousands of painters truly love it and are already using it daily.\n Pledge and get one FREE copy of our miniature painting book written by Angel Giraldez.\nWhen painting miniatures, you cannot hold your miniatures with bare hands: You need a miniature handle. Today, there is no straightforward solution on the market: they are either too clumsy, not ergonomic, or overly expensive.\nThat's why last year we created RGG 360\u00b0, the first natural ergonomic handle for miniature painting.\nWith our unique design, you are able to hold your miniature for long and comfortable painting sessions. No more cramps, no more unnecessary movement, just you having fun painting.\nRGG 360\u00b0 has been designed by painters for painters and developed with the feedback of pro-painters.\nIt is already considered the best paint handle available.\nThe first naturally ergonomic handle\nA simple straight handle does not fit your hand comfortably. To achieve high quality when painting, you need to stay focused and to hold your miniature naturally without causing hand fatigue. RGG 360\u00b0 is slightly curved and designed to feel completely natural in your hand. That\u2019s why the sculpted handle has been designed to sit comfortably in the hand. No odd shapes.\nRGG 360\u00b0 is the only natural ergonomic handle designed to create the best connection between you and your miniature, helping you adopt the best painting position and minimizing unnecessary movements.\nThe added benefits are greater stability, better precision, and minimized fatigue so that you can paint for hours.\nAdopt the best painting handle, for a pleasant, fun, and perfect painting session\nExhilarating 360\u00b0 rotation\n360\u00b0 rotation axis is not an afterthought, but rather it is inherent to the natural ergonomic design. The 360\u00b0 rotation is highly intuitive and easy to adjust, allowing you access to any part of your miniature quickly and reliably. The level of resistance is such that the RGG 360\u00b0 is smooth and easy to rotate when needed. \nRGG 360\u00b0 can rotate easily, yes, but once you stopped the rotation, it will just stay in place. You don\u2019t need to hold it with your thumb\nThanks to our custom made mounting putty, you can fix a large range of miniatures from your favorite games! The mounting putty is safe and reusable\u2014in fact, we have been using the same putty for months!\nRound, square, small, large, exotic bases\u2026miniature bases come in many shapes. When designing RGG 360\u00b0, we tried several different physical designs and all kinds of sticky materials, but they were either non-adaptive, clumsy, heavy, non-reusable... but they all had their disadvantages.\nSo, we have created a custom made mounting putty, as the perfect mounting solution for your miniatures: Reusable, adaptable, and safe. We have been using the putty for over a year now, and it has never dried out.\nWith 15 grams included with the handle, you have 3x the amount needed to stick your miniatures.\nOne RGG360\u00b0- Multiple miniatures\nSwappable cap: You can now paint multiple miniatures with just one holder. Switch easily between your miniatures. Just remove the top cap and place a new one on your RGG360\u00b0 painting handle. (additional caps sold separately)\n Perfect for batch painting! \nRGG 360\u00b0 caps are made of strong ABS plastic and can be used for a long time.\nImproved stability \nMagnetic dock: Secure your WIP miniature thanks to the magnet inside the holder.\nThe metal plate comes with a 3M adhesive on the backside. You can easily attach the metal plate to your desk or workbench. Once it is secured, your docking system is ready.\nEach RGG 360\u00b0Handle includes the following: \n1 RGG360\u00b0 Magnet / Blue Edition, 15 g of orange mounting putty and 1 metal plate. \n Redgrassgames team up with Angel Giraldez!\nPledge during the Kickstarter campaign to get one FREE copy of our miniature painting book written by a true master, Angel Giraldez. \nAngel Giraldez started as a studio painter where he introduced his popular and innovative painting method to the world.

The first K.S. was a very complex project, coordinating many di\ufb00erent suppliers worldwide. But it was a big success with more than 8,000 backers. We have learned from this experience how to create a technical product with a lot of backers from all around the world. Now, we have successfully delivered our second Kickstarter campaign, RGG 360\u00b0 (first version). The product is proven and well designed. For our third Kickstarter campaign, we do not expect any issues since the production is underway and successfully tested by influencers and pro-painters around the world.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nWe\u2019ve resorted to stronger plastics, reusable putty, and a very durable axis made of metal.

The factory meets the ISO 14001 standard that sets out the requirements for an environmental management system.

I'm Michelle, the human behind Pollia Design, where you'll find an eclectic mix of fun and uplifting t-shirts, enamel pins, and other accessories.\nA board game convention was my doorway into the wide world of enamel pins, but I can hardly find any specific, niche board gamer pin collections out there. So I decided to make one!\nThis collection of 15 PINS celebrates some of the unique Board Game mechanics and genres. Wear them prominently and you may just find someone new to add to your game group :)\nWhy Order Through Kickstarter?\nThis is a HUGE and exciting set of pins that I would frankly not be able to produce without the campaign funds, so if the pins aren't funded here, they won't exist AT ALL!\nBy backing this campaign, you will get not just the pins, but bonus board game stickers for FREE!\nWhile funded pins will later be available in my shop, you'll never see prices as low as the bundles you see here.\nThe Pins\nThe main funding goal of $300 covers this first tier \"Board Gamer\" pin. Each additional $300 raised after that funds and unlocks another pin that you will be able to pick as a reward!\nEach of these pins will be made with :\n Black Nickel metal plating\n 2 pinbacks with clear rubber clutches to avoid spinning and keep your pin secure\nWhite, grays, and a color pop of these playful, bright colors (except for the first pin, which gets ALL the colors!) These were designed with pantone colors to ensure accuracy in manufacturing, but please note that all screens display colors a little differently.\nHard Enamel\nIn case it's hard to picture 33 mm, you can reference the pin size with these scale paper models, which my husband immediately laminated using his print-and-play crafting skills :\nFreebie Stickers\nThese 4 stickers will be unlocked alongside the pins in the campaign and included for FREE according to your reward level! They will be sturdy, glossy stickers, 2.5 in. tall, on heavy duty vinyl. You will be able to add more stickers to your reward later, if you so choose.\n(Update: we have surpassed $3600, so all of the stickers are unlocked and available for you!)\nSticker Sheet\nThis sticker sheet is unlocked from the get-go and includes sticker versions of all of the 15 pin designs. These individual stickers are ~1.3 in. tall, the same size as their pin brethren. (You'll also be able to add these to your reward later in the survey if you want.)\nTimeline\nAll of the design files have been perfected and the pins and stickers are ready to be sent forward with the push of a button. My manufacturing partner, who did a wonderful job producing my previous four pins, has already seen the design proofs and quoted me for their production. Despite the current overall-bananas global situation, I have developed this conservative timeline:\nMay - June: This campaign will be live\nLate June: Surveys sent out\nJuly: Funds received, pins and stickers begin manufacturing\nAugust: Completed pins and stickers shipped to me and I begin checking them for quality and packaging them up for you\nLate August/September: Rewards sent out!\n(A note on international shipping: I am planning to use USPS First Class International Package service to save you all some cash, but it may take the pins a week or two longer to reach you. If you're extra eager, contact me and we can get you some more expensive, but faster, shipping.)\nFunding Breakdown\nOf the initial $300 funding goal - covering the \"Board Gamer\" pin and sticker sheet - the budget breaks down as follows:\n70% Manufacturing costs for pins and stickers\n20% Shipping costs\n5-10% Kickstarter Fees\nSome of the main sketches that led to pins!\nThis is a massive set of pins, and I want you to be able to get all of the different genre pins you want! The best way to be sure that your most-loved pin gets unlocked is to share this campaign with all of your board game night regulars and tabletop simulator friends! You can find posts to share on my instagram and twitter pages @polliadesign (and also a lot of other sketches and fun designs, if you feel like browsing!)\nThank you so much for supporting this campaign, these pins truly cannot become a reality without each and every one of you! And a special thank you to the elite board gamers of Pittsburgh who helped guide these pins toward their final forms :)\n\nYou can see an example of one of the pins I've made this year from the same manufacturing partner I intend to use again! You can find more pictures in my shop here.\n\"Dragon's D20\" hard enamel pin with glitter", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLet's address the elephant in the planet - yes, the coronavirus makes everything unpredictable. But I am launching this project now, as my manufacturer shows no sign of closing down, and these pins should be produced and shipped out before any second wave of the virus has a chance to wreak mayhem. Even in the event of some other issues out of my control, the worst case scenario will be a delay.\n\n(I never would have thought I would need to put this disclaimer, but here goes: In the event of a worldwide governmental collapse or apocalypse, it may be a substantial delay before you get these pins.

Then back this campaign so that I can make this happen and you can get some of these gorgeous pins.\nThe pins will be 1\"1/4 / 3cm in size. The metal used will be dark gray reflective nickel to highlight the borders and make them shine. We will be using a silkscreen printing method to allow the final prodcut to keep as much details are possible.\nThere are three different pledge tiers you can get. The adventurer tier is great for individuals who want to rep their favorite class and get a single pin. The party tier comes with 5 pins at a reduced price, enough to deck out your whole party or keep for yourself if you just really like pins. The last tier offers an even better value for you! The collector tier gets you all 13 pins at an even better price per pin. \nIf you want to get more pins just add 8\u20ac (or $9) to your pledge level for each extra pin that you want. \nWhile all of the art for the pins is finished there are still a few things that need to be taken care of. First is making sure that all the pins look good when manufactured. We're going to double check the designs to ensure the manufacturer can make them look just as amazing as they can be.\nAfter that I can give the manufacturer the okay to start making the pins.

Only the great consulting detective\u2013Sherlock Holmes\u2013can unravel this mystery.\nBackers will become the first daring investigators to venture back to Victorian London and attempt to bring the killer to justice!

Part board game, part puzzle, part role-playing game, Murders By Mail is a new type of murder mystery game. Play alone or with friends\u2013great for couples and families looking for a non-TV-based activity! All you need to play is a mailbox and a cellphone.\nGameplay is simple:\nA box will arrive in the mail containing your case file.

They are what got my brother Brady and me into the hobby back when we were teenagers. Whether we\u2019re using them in roleplaying games, board games, or tabletop miniatures games, we love collecting, assembling, painting, and playing with them. While Blacklist Games has published several of our games that feature miniatures, they saw our passion could be used for the creation of a new division that would focus solely on miniatures and allow for company growth in parallel with creating great board games. With everyone at the company excited about the possibility of this new division, here we are to share it with you!\nBlacklist Miniatures will focus entirely on producing high quality, highly detailed, pre-assembled plastic miniatures to be used in any type of game. Blacklist Miniatures: Fantasy Series 1, our first miniatures line, is not only a celebration of our love for miniatures, but also of all things fantasy.\nWith your support, this campaign will not only bring this project to life, but also open the door to other lines of miniatures in various genres and even new games to utilize them! \nBlacklist Games has published several board games that include detailed plastic miniatures. With each game we publish, we learn more about how to improve the quality of the miniatures we produce. When you compare the miniatures in our first game, Street Masters, with those in our most recent game, Altar Quest, you can see these improvements.\nBlacklist Miniatures will take this experience and apply it to produce our best miniatures yet. These miniatures are 28mm scale and will be produced in PVC plastic.\nDragon (Kickstarter Exclusive!)\nMale Elf Paladin\nOrc\nOoze\nQUARTERMASTER LOGISTICS\nBlacklist Games, LLC is proud to announce that Quartermaster Logistics (QML) will be handling our fulfillment for Blacklist Miniatures: Fantasy Series 1.\nQML has an outstanding reputation for their transparent and stellar customer service, allowing for backers to get freight/shipping updates and personable QA solutions directly from them. From what we\u2019ve seen, they have high standards when it comes to ensuring packages are delivered with enough protection and care to give backers and publishers a peace of mind.\nFinding the perfect fit for logistics has been an immense test of trial and error, but after better understanding the needs of backers and our own expectations, we are now confident and excited for this new direction and our partnership with QML for this campaign.\nShipping\nLike our previous campaigns, shipping will be collected after this Kickstarter campaign concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship, via our pledge manager (see the \u201cTerms and Conditions\u201d section below for more details). This is because shipping varies from region to region.\nDepending on which region you are in, we will ship from the following hubs: UK (for EU/UK backers), China (for Asia Pacific backers), Canada (for Canadian backers), Australia (for Australia and New Zealand backers) or Indiana (for USA and the rest of the world).\nPlease note: Altar Quest add-ons (Altar Quest Quest Tier Pledge, Ruins of Arkenspire, First Four) will ship in a separate, earlier wave. See below for details.\nSHIPPING FOR FANTASY SERIES 1 ITEMS\nThe current estimated delivery for Fantasy Series 1 items (Adventurer Tier, Guildmaster Tier, Altar Quest Lurker Pack add-on) is December 2020.\nThe following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg or 8.8lbs volumetric weight).Keep in mind costs may increase based on weight from unlocked stretch goals and/or any optional add-ons purchased.\nUSA: $10-$15 to most states. $65 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.\nCANADA: $12-$18 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $70-$80 to most countries (see below).\nASIA: $10-$15 to China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. $35 to most other countries.\nOCEANIA: $20-$25 to Australia and New Zealand.\nAFRICA: $95 to most countries.\nEUROPE: $15-$20 to most countries.\n$25-$30 to Norway, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia.\n$50 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland.\n$65-$70 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia.\n  Unfortunately, because of certain import laws and customs, we currently are NOT ABLE TO SHIP TO Afghanistan, Argentina, Brazil, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Russia.\nIf your territory is listed above we hope to be able to offer our product to you later at retail, but are unable to commit to shipping to these territories during the Kickstarter.\nSHIPPING FOR ALTAR QUEST ADD-ONS\nIf you pledge for any of the Altar Quest add-ons (Altar Quest Quest Tier Pledge, First Four Hero Pack, Ruins of Arkenspire) during this campaign, they will be shipped to you separately from your Fantasy Series 1 items. They will be shipped in the same time period as rewards are shipped to backers of the Altar Quest campaign (current estimate is July 2020).\nYou will pay for this shipment based on the shipping rates from the Altar Quest Kickstarter campaign. In other words, you will pay the same shipping costs that Altar Quest backers paid for these items to be shipped.\nTerms and Conditions\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that you have read and accepted the following terms and conditions.\nFINAL PRODUCT\nThe products/rewards shown on this Kickstarter page are subject to change. The final products/rewards you receive could differ from what is presented here.\nPROJECT UPDATES\nIt is your responsibility as a backer of this project to read project updates in order to stay up to date with important details and requests from the Blacklist Games team.\nCOMMUNICATING WITH BLACKLIST GAMES POST-CAMPAIGN\nPlease note that we do not monitor the Kickstarter messaging inbox outside of a live Kickstarter campaign. Therefore, after this project has ended, please ensure to send all communications to customerservice@blacklistgamesllc.com\nREFUND POLICY\nFull refunds are available within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end date. All refunds taking place within 14 days of the close of the campaign are reversed in full via Stripe to your credit card.\nAfterwards, refunds minus the Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we cannot recuperate) will be available before and during the first 30 days the pledge manager is open. Once these initial 30 days have passed, no refunds will be possible. A reminder of the refund cutoff date will be announced in project updates.\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed as previously stated.\nCOMPLETING THE PLEDGE MANAGER\nIn the weeks following the conclusion of the campaign, an email invitation to our pledge manager will be sent to all backers to allow them entry to the pledge manager; further details on this process will be provided in a project update published around the same time the email invites are sent out.\nBackers must confirm their \u201corder\u201d (pledge rewards + purchased add-ons) in our pledge manager before its closing date in order to receive their order. \u201cConfirming your order\u201d means entering your valid shipping information and paying any balances due for shipping costs and selected add-ons in the pledge manager.\nIf you confirm your order by the closing date of the pledge manager, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your confirmed order as entered into the pledge manager. That title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.\nIf you do not confirm your order before the closing date of the pledge manager, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payments/donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, agree to place you on a waiting list for backers with unconfirmed orders if you contact us after the closing date of the pledge manager but before fulfillment of rewards begins. Backers on this list will be contacted once initial fulfillment to backers has concluded in order to offer them a final chance to complete their orders; note that this process would not involve the pledge manager and that any shipments sent as a result of this process would not benefit from any \u201cfriendly shipping\u201d rates offered during the Kickstarter campaign and would undoubtedly be shipped at a higher cost due to not benefitting from overall Kickstarter shipping rates. \nRemember that unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and could lead to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, therefore if you do not complete your order by the pledge manager\u2019s closing date, we cannot guarantee the availability of add-ons/exclusive items in sufficient quantity for your pledge.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFollowing five successful Kickstarter campaigns, we are continuing to learn how to further improve our marketing, design, manufacturing, fulfillment, and distribution, as well as how best to nurture our growing community. \n\nThe following are the statuses of our crowdfunding projects:\n\nStreet Masters: Fulfilled\nBrook City: Fulfilled\nAftershock: Delivering now\nAltar Quest: In production at the manufacturer\nHour of Need: Development wrapping up \n\nThere are a lot of moving parts with Kickstarter campaigns, and timing is often one of the biggest obstacles, especially for smaller publishers such as ourselves.

However, many more exist within the infinite realms of the Drift, throughout which the dreams of every living creature in the universe are interwoven.\nFor Poppy, a lonely young girl with severe narcolepsy, these myriad worlds are a cherished escape from her own. But that all changes when she meets a mysterious black cat and learns of the nightmares that dwell within the Drift.

These Drifters live by a simple mantra:\nProtect the Drift. Slay the Nightmare. Free the Mara. Do not go Dark.\nThe Drift is a world of dreams\u2014A vast multiverse that exists parallel to our own reality, which Drifters call the prime reality. The Drift is comprised of an infinite number of realms called demesnes. Creatures that sleep end up in the Drift, traveling through their subconscious thoughts, or traversing the Jungian collective wisdom and creativity of humanity. But there are dark thoughts that dwell within the Drift: nightmares that seek to infest all dreams and seep into the prime reality.\nOnly Drifters, cursed with the ability to travel between the myriad demesnes of the Drift, can hunt these nightmares down and slay them before they infect dreamers and begin the cycle anew. But nightmares are not so easily slain...and every encounter a Drifter has with their inner darkness could transform them into the very thing they hunt.\nThe Key and the Crescent is both a whimsical fantasy adventure and a psychological thriller. Can Poppy slay the nightmare and set things right? Or will she become its next victim?\nStill not convinced? \nRead this sample chapter RIGHT NOW!\nIf you pledge at the Dreamer level ($3), you'll help pay for my next latte. You will not receive a copy of The Key and the Crescent, but you will receive my eternal gratitude.\nIf you're looking to snag yourself a copy of The Key and the Crescent, it is available in three formats:\nIf you pledge at the Drifter level ($10), you'll receive a link to download the digital version of The Key and the Crescent, DRM-free, in several different formats (.mobi, .epub, and .pdf). This can be downloaded an unlimited number of times and transferred to any device you own. (Estimated delivery date: August.)\nAt the Darkdrifter level ($20), you'll receive the above download from the Drifter tier, along with a 6\"x9\" paperback edition of The Key and the Crescent shipped to you. Shipping costs will be added to your pledge amount. (Estimated delivery date: September.)\nAt the Black Cat level ($40), you'll receive the digital download from the Drifter tier, along with a signed 6\"x9\" hardcover edition of The Key and the Crescent with a sleek dust jacket. Again, as noted above, shipping costs will be added to your pledge. (Estimated delivery date: September.)\nFinally, at the very limited Chancel-maker level ($80), you'll receive everything from the Black Cat tier, and your signed copy of The Key and the Crescent will come with a personalized message just for you. Then I'll work with you to write a short 2-3k word short story wherein a Drifter stumbles into your very own dream or nightmare, which I'll publish in a future KS campaign update. Lastly, you'll get a sneak peek into future Darkdrifters series content! (Estimated delivery date: September.)\n(Note: Keep in mind shipping costs can be expensive, especially for backers outside of the US! Sadly, this is out of my control.)\nAdd-Ons / Additional Copies\nInterested in purchasing more than one copy of The Key and the Crescent? Not a problem! Simply pledge at the desired level and multiply your pledge amount by the number of copies you desire. For example, if you want two copies of the hardcover edition, pledge at the Black Cat level and add an additional $40 (for a total of $80).\nAs shipping multiple copies to a single person will inflate shipping costs, please limit your purchase to a maximum of three copies. If you want more than three copies, feel free to contact me personally and we can figure something out!\nWhy Kickstarter? In short, this is a passion project for me. This story is very near and dear to my heart, so it is important to me that I retain creative control over the endeavor, which is why I have opted to self-publish for now. However, there are a lot of costs associated with writing and publishing a novel: artwork, graphic design, editing, proofreading, printing, and shipping, to name a few. I'm not really looking to make money off of this Kickstarter\u2014my goal is simply to get this story out into the world. In other words, excess money raised by this Kickstarter (that is, money raised beyond its funding goal) will go towards making The Key and the Crescent even better.\nThe Key and the Crescent currently has some wonderful cover art by vacuum-chan / Sofiia Drozdova, which you can see above, and some preliminary editing. If The Key and the Crescent is funded, I will be hiring an editor out-of-pocket to make sure it is the best it can be. But with enough funding, we can do even more.\nBoring $$$ Stuff \nWhen backing a Kickstarter, it's always important to know where your money is going and how it is being spent. Here is the breakdown of how the initial funding goal of $4250 is to be spent.\nFirst are the production costs. If the project is funded, I'll be ordering\u2014at minimum\u2014300 paperback copies of The Key and the Crescent, costing ~$2373, and 60 hardcover copies, costing ~$1040. Due to the way bulk production works, these copies would first be shipped to me before being shipped individually to backers. This initial shipment would cost ~$188 for the 300 paperbacks and ~$67 for the hardcovers. All copies of The Key and the Crescent are being produced through Lulu.com, a well-known self-publishing service.\nThe hardcover editions will also come with posters that should run about $94 (production + shipping) and bookmarks for ~$30.\nFinally, Kickstarter requires 10% in additional fees, so a little over $420 more on top.\nThis all adds up to about $4,212\u2014just slightly under our funding goal!\nOf course, other factors can and will change these numbers. In general, the more backers we have, the lower the per-unit costs will be. I will strive to keep backers updated on any and all developments that might affect production and shipping costs.\nNote: this section does not factor in your own shipping costs\u2014those costs will be added onto your pledge and therefore aren't a factor in whether The Key and the Crescent is successfully funded.\nWith your support, I would love to make The Key and the Crescent even better. Depending on how much money we are able to raise beyond the project's funding goal, my intent is to use this support to improve the book in various ways.\n$7,000: Instead of the one editor, I can afford to hire a full suite (a developmental editor, a copyeditor, and a proofreader) in order to ensure that The Key and the Crescent is top-notch.\n$10,000: I will commission four new B&W art pieces for the interior of The Key and the Crescent, to be used at the start of each act of the book.\n$16,000: The big one \u2014 I will hire a professional voice actor to record an audiobook format for The Key and the Crescent.\nI may add more social or community-based goals as the campaign progresses, as well. Stay tuned to my twitter account for more details! https://twitter.com/NatsunoYoru\nAdditionally, it is worth noting that more editing and artwork may delay the physical release of The Key and the Crescent. Again, I will make sure you always have an up-to-date timeline!\nTales of the Drift\nAs a special thank you for your swift and unwavering support, I've decided to add an additional reward to this project. Tales of the Drift is a short story collection composed of all of the personalized short stories from the \"Chancel-maker\" pledges, along with one or more other short stories I've written in the Darkdrifters universe. It will come in a 6\"x9\" saddle-stitched booklet or a perfect-bound softcover, depending on its final page count, and will be included in every Darkdrifter ($20), Black Cat ($40), and Chancel-maker ($80) pledge, at no additional cost. Additionally, all backers (including at the $10 Drifter tier) will also receive Tales of the Drift in DRM-free digital formats (.mobi, .epub, and .pdf). I'll also be posting each story individually, below, as they are finished.\nThank you all for your support!\nEpisode One: The Dream of the Wonder Wheel\nGreetings! My name is Matthew Newman, author of The Key and the Crescent and lead developer of Arkham Horror: The Card Game. \nFirst off, thank you so much for checking out my Kickstarter. While this is my first time attempting to self-publish a novel, I've been writing stories pretty much ever since I could hold a pen. Darkdrifters is a setting I have had in my head for years, and it is an absolute dream come true to see it become a reality. I'm really excited (and simultaneously terrified) for people to finally get their hands on it. I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I have enjoyed writing it.\nMy credentials include insomnia, existential dread, and jumping whenever I see a spider.\nMore Darkdrifters!\nDiscord server: https://discord.gg/ZGbpbvU\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/NatsunoYoru\nCredits\nAll artwork is by vacuum / Sofiia Drozdova.

While I am confident I will be able to ship rewards to all backers without too much trouble, there may be hiccups in the timeline, and things may be delayed depending on how much additional content I decide to add based on the success of the Kickstarter. Additionally, depending on how long editing and proofreading takes, the timeline may change. Finally, the situation with COVID-19 may end up delaying production and shipping.\n\nLastly, I am just one person, not a whole publishing company, so depending on how many people want physical copies of the book, it may take longer than expected for things to ship.\n\nOf course, I will be sure to communicate all of this to you at every stage, so you are fully aware of these issues as they arise.\n\nThank you for understanding! \u2665\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 3 or more", "title": "Dreamer", "descp": "Don't want a copy of the book, but want to support me anyway?

It's simple, just imagine five people narrating a story together. \ud83d\udcac The Game Master will outline the situation and surroundings: \u201cYou, four heroes, finally opened the door, the room is on fire, smoke is everywhere.\u201d One of the players responds: \u201cUh! I hold my nose and slowly proceed into the building. What do I see?\u201d And it might go on and on.\nThe most important thing? You will experience unforgettable adventures and have fun, both with your friends. Let's be real here, friends who slay a dragon together, stay together, no doubt about that! \ud83d\udc09\nToo long didn\u2019t read:\nWhat: Mobile role-playing app\nKey things: Automized rules, non-stop gaming, new friendships made\nEarly Access: Summer 2020\nRelease: By the end of 2020\nPlatforms: iOS & Android\nThe Game Master is the narrator and referee, players role-play their hero characters by describing what they do and say. Sometimes you might need to roll a dice \ud83c\udfb2 to see the outcome of your action, other times you might even fight in a battle or resolve a riddle.\nOur goal is to create the best role-playing tool possible. If you\u2019re a player, we\u2019ll ensure you\u2019re being entertained in a campaign for months or even years.

Special appearances, more playable races (and subraces) and new backgrounds. What you get:\n Appearances - You are able to customize a lot of stuff on your character like face, hairstyle, hair color, eye color, clothes, scars, war paints, pedestals, and other accessories... And you get a lot of them, for free. But with CBP, you will get even more and much fancier options to tweak your character.\n Races - We are planning to launch our app with the 9 base races from 5e OGC DnD. These will be free. And we plan to release a DLC from time to time, introducing a new lands and with them, new races. For example, if you unlock the 5th tier of social goals, you get a Demonic race. Pure blooded demons with (for starters) 3 subraces. From those 2 would be free and 1 premium. So with each content update, you get a bunch of free stuff, but also some premium. The premium stuff will be available to those with CBP.\n Classes - For classes in CBP applies the same as for races.\n Backgrounds - With CBP you get a few new backgrounds, which will get special attention and be perfected to the last line.\nWorld Builder Pass (WBP) Subscription\nAccess exclusive terrains and map objects for your adventure. Create epic battles with premium monsters that have special skills and prepare more entertaining situations with more specialized items (like an expanded fishing set, etc.).

Stuff that you don't use every day, but will make your campaign stand out\n Location Map - The same as on the world map. Except there is more to work with. For example, when building dwarven tunnels, WBP will include stuff like cart rails or beautiful lamps for the walls\n Monsters - You will get premium versions of some monsters. Like ancient skeletons in magical armor or some brand new creatures that our artists will come up with a tweak to the last detail\n Ready-made adventures - Yes, there will be free adventures, but the really well worked out (and that will be most of them) will usually have free beginning only  (so that you can try them out), but the rest you'll have to buy. With WBP you have access to all of them.\n Items - Well this is a section with a loooot of content. Premium items will be for example some magical sets of armor or weapons. But also quite normal things like more tools for fishing, more kinds of fishes or stuff like that. Things that you don't need for running an adventure, but you need them to run YOUR epic adventure.\n Discord Role: FANatic \u2022 You get a unique role on our Discord server that is available only to Kickstarter backers.\nExclusive Kickstarter badge for your in-game characters \u2022 Honorable distinction exclusively for our backers.

Sometimes we spend a whole evening playing the old-school Heroes of Might and Magic III. We also play Dark Souls, Borderlands, or even World of Warcraft.\n\n     We love tabletop roleplaying games too! Our favorite is D&D (5th Edition), but we also like Pathfinder, Shadowrun, or Fate. We have a 4 hour-long session every Monday.\nWe just wanna prove to the world that mobile gaming that goes beyond neverending candies crushing can not only succeed but even create new friendships and communities. \ud83d\udc99\n\n      We believe role-playing can beat casual games and there is a demand for a mobile role-playing platform. We want to prove this with a  successful Kickstarter campaign.\nThe best games are created by the best teams. We plan to use your money to scale our studio. Having more people working full time on this will accelerate the development and it will enable us to produce even better art in larger quantities.

If you haven't yet completed your Backerkit survey, please do so as soon as you can. Like, seriously, go do it now!

They have raised metal lines forming the 'line art' and the recessed sections between the lines are filled with colorful hard enamel.  Then the whole thing is polished smooth!\nAn example of a pin I previously designed, the Kitty Reaper\n Above you can see the front, side and back of the Kitty Reaper, a pin I designed and had produced earlier this year!  The back of the pins have pointed posts with rubber clutches to hold the pins in place when worn.\nPins I have designed worn on a jacket, a lanyard and a small backpack\n People wear pins on jackets, bags, lanyards and other articles of clothing.  Some people prefer to display their collections in shadow boxes or on cork boards.\nI also like to put them on my dice bags!\n My wife and I recently had our third child.  During the month of January I spent many nights on 'night shift' with the new little one.  I had a sleeping newborn cradled in one arm and a sketchbook within reach of the other.  Magic was happening between 2 AM and 5 AM and it all started with a little sketch of a cat wizard...\n One thing led to another and over the course of several weeks I ended up designing 13 classes and a Game Master as black cats!  \nI would like to give a special shout out to Reddit's /DnD for persuading me to include the Artificer!\nBut maybe you had something different in mind?\n For those with more specific taste, at the Custom Kitty reward tier I will work with you to design a Custom Kitty and have it produced as hard enamel pins.  Once they have been produced you will receive twenty-five (25) pins of your choice from this campaign.  Get 25 of your Custom Kitty or swap some out for other pins from this project, it is all up to you!\nI, Joshua Pinkas, will retain all rights to the resulting design and will be able to sell and distribute additional pins or any other derivative work in perpetuity.\nThis kitty doesn't have to play by the 'rules'.  While it could be inspired by a DnD player class it doesn't have to be.  Maybe a tribal shaman is more up your alley, or perhaps a cyborg necromancer kitty!  If it generally can fit under the banner of the Fantasy genre it is fair game!  An Egyptian themed warrior dual-wielding kopesh sounds fun too!\nThe resulting design will be similar in size and style to the other designs in this campaign.\nNo nudity, lewdness, gore, or obviously offense concepts will be allowed.  I reserve the right to refund your pledge in full and cease work on the custom kitty if for some reason we are unable to come to an agreement on the final design.\nIf you pledge at this tier and want pins in addition to the 25 described above please add an additional $8 US per pin you would like.\n I designed these awesome pins, but it is expensive to have them all produced as pins. Think of Kickstarter as a place for you to pre-order these pins.  \nYou pledge money to this campaign, then when the campaign is over Kickstarter collects the money from you and gives it to me.  I then use that money to pay my production partner to make the pins.  Then when I receive them I inspect them for quality, package them up and ship them out to you!  \nIt can take a while for all of that to happen (especially for larger projects like I hope this one will be), but at the end of it we have brought something awesome into the world that didn't exist before, and I cannot do it without your support!  \nThank you for helping me in my creative journey!\nESTIMATED PROJECT TIMELINE\nMarch 26 to April 28 \u2013 Kickstarter Campaign!\nApril 28 to May 5 \u2013 Kickstarter collects pledges from backers.\nMay 5 to May 25 \u2013 Backers fill out surveys.

Pinkas and I am the creator and owner of Frost Dragon Designs, LLC. After years of working on projects for others through freelance work and private commissions, I decided to start building something for myself and started Frost Dragon Designs, LLC.  \nI am a seasoned pin creator and have designed, had manufactured, and delivered thousands of beautiful enamel pins.  Many of my previous designs are available for sale through my online shop, frostdragondesigns.com.\nAll of my designs are my own original creations. I start my creative process with traditional drawings in sketchbooks. Even the simplest of designs will usually go through a dozen or more revisions before I recreate it digitally and prepare the files to send to my manufacturers.\nI love launching new projects and designs on Kickstarter because this is where I got my start with my company, and because I have found a wonderfully supportive community here who genuinely care about creatives.\nEvery pin you back helps fund the production of new original designs!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI am a designer, not a manufacturer, so I have to trust my manufacturer to execute my designs at a high level and on time.

Thank you all. We also got an extension! Sign up for our newsletter and follow along as we develop the Quest Calendar.\n Role play everyday without a GM!\nThe 2021 Quest Calendar is a single-player role playing game that takes place on a page-a-day style calendar. Play it a couple minutes each day over the year and get your daily fix of dice-rolling fantasy fun.  The calendar features a story driven adventure that will be told day by day, with plenty of quests, loot items, characters, and combat.\nAs the story unfolds, how will your decisions over the year shape your character?\nNo need to memorize tons of rules. Pick your character and jump right in. The game is simple. Just follow 3 rules: Read, Roll, and Resolve.\nCombat\nCombat is done much the same way, but with more dice rolling.\nLevel Up\nAs the year goes on, your hero will get better in many ways.\nGet the 2021 Quest Calendar with a few extra items to make playing every day more fun.\n\nCustom Character Note:\nThe custom character will not be printed with the calendar. Nor will it be available in the laminated character book.You will have it available to download and print. You will get a page for each level your character will achieve (along with their stat increases and new abilities).\nIf you choose to allow, we can make this character available to download for others on the website.\nThe Custom Day WILL be printed with the calendar!\nIf you want extra of anything available (with the exception of the \"Custom Characters\" and  \"Design You Own Day\" due to limited quantity) please add an additional amount to your pledge per the following. \nWe will be using a pledge manager after the campaign ends. The pledge manager will allow you to add on extras like more dice sets. You will be able to use the extra credit in the pledge manager for this loot.\nAfter this project gets funded, there are a few things we can do to improve the fun. Some plans we are considering are new calendar features, more characters, different dice colors, a dice tower add on, and even minis.\n I've never liked any existing systems for fantasy months. There are good ones, but every time a player asks, \"What is the in-game date?\" and I've told them, I always get a look of confusion before I reply, \"A Saturday in late November.\" With this funding level, I will add a homebrew date system that translates to the Gregorian calendar (the one we use).  As you play daily, you will get familiar with it and be able to use it easily in your own tabletop RPGs.\n\nSo far we have a Thief, Druid, Sorceress, and Barbarian. Once we reach 30k, I will be able to create a new character for you to play: a Paladin. \nOnce we reach 35k, I will be able to create a new character for you to play: the Bard. Yes, his image is modeled after the creator of the Quest Calendar himself.\n\nAt 40k, I will upgrade the dice from a solid color (though still pretty) to an appealing swirl of colors. The dice colors are still in the works, but instead of a solid color, they will a nice galaxy swirl pattern similar to the one in the promo shot. The dice included will still be mini dice, though!\nA small draw string dice bag to hold your mini dice when you aren't adventuring, or to take them with you!  It will be unlocked at 55k and like the mini dice, it will come free with every 2021 quest calendar.\nOur 22k funding goal will allow us to pay for the extensive amount of artwork for this calendar as well as get it into production. It requires 300+ full color illustrations. Without your backing, this calendar won't happen.\nIf this project is successful, we will be back here with a new story, new heroes, and more adventure in another Quest Calendar. Look forward to other themes such as horror, space fantasy, pirates, western, samurai, zombie apocalypse, etc. We will send out polls to get your input on what you want to see next. If there is interest in reprinting this year's story, we may do so.\nThere is a lot of content in this calendar, which makes it heavy. It is practically a book but doesn't count as media mail. Consequently, shipping gets to be expensive, more so for international shipping. We have included estimated shipping rates for different regions in the chart below.\nIn order to provide you with the best possible value, shipping will be charged through our pledge manager after the campaign ends. The pledge manager will also allow you to confirm your shipping address, add on extras like more dice sets, upgrade your backer reward, and finalize your order.\n\nThese are our current estimates for shipping. We aren't too happy with this either and we will continue to look for better options for our customers after the campaign. The actual costs could change based on varying circumstances. A large success here may allow us to partner with a fulfillment center that can reduce the customer cost.\nLocal Pickup\nIf you are local to the Denver, Colorado Springs, or Pueblo area, we will host a local pickup event so you can pick up your copy for free. For those willing to drive to Colorado Springs, we will set up a time and a location at a local game shop so you can come get your Quest Calendar packages, meet the creator, and get your copy signed. You will be able to select this option in the pledge manager after the campaign ends.\nIf you are still reading, I want to thank you. This game calendar means a lot to me. It is pretty scary to make something and and put yourself out there for the first time. I began this project because I believe I have a great product that will fill your need for fun every day and I am passionate and dedicated to bringing it to you.\n\nRetailers\nAre you a Friendly Local Game Store interested in backing 2021 Quest Calendar for your customers?

This is our first Kickstarter, but we have laid the groundwork with our manufacturing and logistic partners to walk through the process of getting the product from production to your door. \n\nIn our research, we discovered that there are many potential deadline issues others have with manufacturing in China. Luckily for this project, there are very few components to worry about so there are less manufacturing risks.\n\nThe calendar is not in its completed state. Though the mechanics and story are mostly done, there is a substantial number of art assets, some writing, and play testing to complete. This is why we are on Kickstarter.

But let's not stop there! Let's add more content to Swords 'n Magic and Stuff with our stretch goals!\n\nWe reached all of our stretch goals for the campaign and we couldn't be more excited! Thank you to everyone who contributed and helped us make this a reality. \nWe obviously can't promise that Swords 'n Magic will be accepted by Nintendo but now we can afford to focus on porting in case we are. We promise to do everything within our power to get the game there and keep you in the loop every step of the way.\nWe love this community and couldn't imagine developing a game without all of you right behind us.\nSwords 'n Magic and Stuff is a cute, cooperative, open world video game centered around the joy of discovery. This game is a passion project that I've been bringing to life for over two years now. Swords 'n Magic and Stuff is a love letter to all the game worlds I lost myself in growing up.  The game is being developed with my wife and daughter in mind. We'd searched for years for a game like Swords 'n Magic and finally I just decided that I'd have to take matters into my own hands.\nThe game is a casual journey of discovery. You take the role of a blank slate adventurer just waiting for their chance to carve out their destiny. With no classes, levels or restrictions, you can be whoever you want to be, use whatever weapons and items you can buy, loot or craft, and play however you wish. You can seek out epic adventures laden with legendary treasure or enjoy the simple life of owning a small farm, crafting furniture for your home or even just traveling the world as a simple merchant. In Swords 'n Magic and Stuff you play at your own pace with no hand-holding.\nTirawyn is a high fantasy world where a good king has befallen a terrible curse and fled his throne in an attempt to save his kingdom from himself. The people of Tirawyn are in a state of panic as evil begins to lurk in all corners of the realm and novice adventurers begin to take matters into their own hands. But are they causing more trouble than they're worth? \nWatch the lore episode from the Swords 'n Magic devlog below to learn more about the history of Tirawyn and how the world came to be. \nSwords 'n Magic and Stuff has been designed and developed live on Twitch.tv from the ground up with an audience of passionate fantasy RPG fans. This game is a tribute to this wonderful community who has supported it from its humble beginnings and because of that, fan input has always been a high priority for me. So much so that some of the in-game clothing designs and lore books were actually created by the Swords 'n Magic community through a content submission system for our most creative fans. We plan to continue this effort, and in doing so, keep as connected as possible with fans, treating your ideas and opinions with the respect and consideration they deserve.\nJoin our Discord to see frequent updates about the game, share your ideas for the game and to chat with like-minded adventurers!\nSwords 'n Magic and Stuff stands out because of all the individual pieces that fit together to create a dynamic, immersive world for you to lose yourself in. While we understand the excitement of exploring dangerous lands and fighting powerful monsters, as long-time Dungeons and Dragons players, we also understand that the downtime in an adventure should be just as engaging. Which is why a lot of our features revolve around town-life and the act of owning and decorating your own home among many other non-combat gameplay features.\nOur core design pillars are exploration, discovery, curiosity and growth. We use these to drive our core gameplay loop which is designed to be as follows: Players explore a new area, discover something interesting, seek out more about that new interest driven by curiosity and not a quest log with tick boxes, then return to their home to rest and evaluate the items they've discovered in order to progress and grow as a character and a player. Of course, we also believe that getting lost in loops within loops is a very intriguing part of open world game design, which is why we've not only designed specific zones to fit into this loop, but also sections of each zone and even the items within those sections. Everything is driven by discovery and curiosity, which is why it's so important for us to create hand crafted content that's unique and engaging for players of all ages and skill levels.\nHere's a breakdown of some of the most noteworthy features in Swords 'n Magic and Stuff to get an idea of all there is for players to experience:\nPlay with your friends in networked multiplayer\nCollect and discover hundreds of items\nUse anything - No class or level restrictions\nHands-off quests - No breadcrumbs or quest markers\nDual wield anything\nBuy, tame and collect dozens of mounts and pets\nSeasons and weather effects\nSeasonal events and unique seasonal items\nMini-games like tavern dice and target practice\nJoin factions and rise through the ranks\nTitles that show off your accomplishments\nBuild or purchase homes and furniture to decorate them with\nFish, hunt, grow and harvest resources to cook hearty meals with\nGather materials and craft your own furniture and weapons\nExplore a wide variety of dungeons\nPvP Arenas to test your mettle with your friends\nCollect clothes, hats and armor to customize your character\nNon-gendered character creation\nTwitch integration to get your viewers into the action\nA private, dedicated server you can host yourself\nFully mappable keybinds and gamepad support\nWe don't believe in hand-holding or tick boxes when it comes to questing. We're approaching each quest as a separate adventure driven entirely by curiosity. Instead of accepting a quest from an NPC, you'll have the opportunity to add intriguing information to your journal to keep track of information for later. Finding a book about an ancient sword forgotten by history isn't just lore, but a treasure map in its own right. Asking around could lead you on a new epic journey to find that long lost weapon and learn about why it's important along the way, if that's your thing.\nMany games offer multiplayer, but not many offer what Swords 'n Magic plans to. I want to give players the best and most connected experience possible. Playing together means also being able to play apart. You aren't tethered to your friends when playing. Explore the world at your own pace and party up when you feel like it. And when you're ready to join another friend, take your entire character and everything they're holding with you. No need to make a new character for every new server.\n\nHost a game directly through Steam for up to 8 players or host a dedicated server wherever you like so you and all your friends can come and go as you please. Password protect your worlds or invite anyone and make new friends.  Customize your hosted world with options that cater to how you want to experience the world.\n\nSwords 'n Magic is designed to sidestep a drawback my wife and I have experienced many times with multiplayer RPG's. We hate having to start new worlds or new characters when we invite a new friend to play with us. In this game we're doing our best to make sure that not only can a new friend join at any time, but with no level restrictions, they can join in on the fun right off the bat. You can simply share some of your higher tier gear with them, or if they'd prefer to work for it themselves, you can trade your gear out at your house for some of your weaker items and join in on their adventure as an equal. \n\n\nBacking the game gets you access to exclusive Kickstarter rewards. All tiers which include game keys also include access to these rewards. When the game launches we'll also be offering a Hero Edition, which includes even more exclusive in-game content. Because we believe that pay to win mechanics are a dark cloud over the game industry, none of our exclusive in-game rewards offer any actual gameplay advantages and are merely cosmetic. \nWant to back with PayPal? No problem! Head over here to do so:\n\n\nBonus reward!\nGuess what! Because of how much more this campaign has brought in than we expected, we decided to add a new reward for everyone to show our appreciation. Every tier that receives a game key will also get a super cute, in-game, baby fox pet. Here's some awesome concept art drawn by our artist, Kitsunne.\n\n\nKindred Games was founded in early 2018 by me, Michael Kocha. I started Swords 'n Magic and Stuff as a solo project under no studio name thinking it would be a quick 3 month game project I used to learn Unreal Engine. But when I started streaming the game and began growing a small, but very dedicated fanbase, features and ideas started piling up and the game became a bigger project, eventually growing into my dream project.  \n This is when I began Kindred Games. I knew from the start that the studio needed to represent the passion I felt for making games with an audience and my family in mind. Kindred, which means one's family, was such a perfect word for how I wanted to treat this project and ultimately my game studio.\nSix months into development I'd built a nice little prototype of what I thought the game could feel like. I released it to many of my most dedicated fans and received loads of feedback and praise. Though I thought the game only had a couple hours of content, some of my testers racked up over a dozen hours in the project looking for every single secret and trying to find every item in the game. That's when I knew what the core focus of the game needed to be. The joy of discovery.\nI got to work learning more about Unreal Engine and taking the project more seriously. I knew the prototype was a success and that the game was going to be something worth investing my time into. I brought on a programmer (Not Moz!) to add multiplayer to the game at this time as well.\nBut it's hard to make a video game while living in a hotel room for 2 months.\nShortly after we started implementing multiplayer my wife, Janna, was relocated to a state halfway across the country and I had to take 3 months off from the game. Partly because of packing and selling our house, and partly because we were stuck in a hotel room for two months before we could find somewhere to live near Janna's work. This was a huge setback for me and the programmer. When I finally returned to the game I'd lost all motivation and ambition. After nearly 6 months of working with the programmer we still couldn't even play the game together. Nothing was working right and all I'd done in 6 months was build half of a new zone and a single dungeon. \nSo I quit.\nI threw in the towel and let the programmer go. This was the lowest point in the development of Swords 'n Magic and probably in all of my game dev career. I had failed to keep the game and my passion for it alive and it really hurt watching my community slowly disappear. My streams had stopped entirely. My testers hadn't received an update in months. Everyone knew that Swords 'n Magic was now dead. Lost in the indie game graveyard with hundreds of thousands of other unfinished games that had real potential.\nI took a few weeks off to reevaluate my goals as a gamedev. Eventually my 3 year old daughter asked me one day to play the game again and asked why I hadn't been working. I loaded it up for her and she sat on my lap and took the gamepad.  I watched her explore the world for the thousandth time as she asked me questions about who the different NPC's were, what they were saying, why they were where they were and if she could be friends with them. She asked me questions about where she could find a better sword and how to get gold so she could buy another potion to drink. She ran away from the monsters and tried hugging all the sheep. Finally she asked if I would make a new character for her to meet. Within the hour I found myself adding more content into the game for her to play through and I knew Swords 'n Magic and Stuff just couldn't be over. Not yet.\n\n\nOne year later\nThe game has changed a lot. Many of the original mechanics have been reworked and now the game features fully functioning multiplayer. I've hired a different programmer on to help with this. I've also embraced the fact that I can't make this game alone this time around. If I'm going to build a game for a growing, loving community then I would need their help in more ways than one.\n\n\nSwords 'n Magic and Stuff is being developed by a team of two developers: Me, (Michael, aka Kindred) and Moz. But we're not the only ones contributing to the game's success. Since I've been streaming the development of the game for over two years I've also grown a small but very dedicated and hard working mod team. Many of these wonderful people have proven to have other very useful talents in places outside moderation so they deserve a mention here as well.\n\nSpecial thanks:\n Gideon - Youtube Video Editor\n Cameron - Website Developer\n Janna - Community Manager\n Brendan - Illustrator\n Wendy - Social Media Management\nEven though these awesome people don't do any work on the game itself, they are still a huge help. Without them I don't think anything would get done around here.\nI've been a stay at home dad for just over 5 years. Since quitting my job in retail I went to school for 3D art and animation for games and earned my bachelor's degree. My goal was always to make games, but I didn't think making my own games for a living would ever be a real possibility. Luckily the opportunity presented itself when we learned that child care cost more than what I made at my job. My wife's career, however, was just beginning to take off and she went on to support the family while I followed my dream of being a dev dad.  \nJust over a month ago my wife, Janna, was informed that the position she currently held was being eliminated. This put her in an awkward spot where she had to choose between applying for positions across the country that she didn't want, or to leave the company she had invested her life into for 12 years.\nAfter a few weeks of serious contemplation she decided that it was time to put all of our cards on the table with Swords 'n Magic and Stuff. \nNow that she's helping full time with Swords 'n Magic we have no other income until the game launches. Kickstarter is a chance for us to fund the development of the game without having to go bankrupt in the meantime.\nWith your help we'll be able to see the rest of the development through without worrying about how to put food on our tables, but we'll also be able to give the game the love and attention it deserves. We've budgeted a chunk of the funds for a custom soundtrack and already have a musician ready to go. We're putting some funds toward marketing to make sure that the game has as many eyes on it as we can get. Some of the funding will go into custom animations and sound effects for the game as well as any additional tools and software costs we run into along the way. And finally, we plan on paying our wonderful programmer, Moz, a cut for all the hard work he's already put in with nothing in return. It's not every day you find a skilled programmer who has enough love for a project to work for a revenue share. We're very lucky to have him so you can play Swords 'n Magic and Stuff with your friends and family. As it was meant to be played.\nBut in the event that the Kickstarter fails, we still plan to continue the project. We hope you understand that this means we'll have to cut back heavily on the game's features and content. We'll have to cancel the musician, deal with limited animation and sound effect assets, we'll have to find a way to market the game on no budget and worst of all, rush the project to completion. This means the game won't be what we envision, but I couldn't move on from it without knowing that we did everything we could to make it succeed.\nI truly believe wholeheartedly in this game. I hope that you'll consider supporting us in this project so we can bring  my passion project to life. I can't wait to see you in the game. Thanks for reading. <3", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBased on all the Kickstarter horror stories of games being abandoned after a successful campaign, I think it's obvious that the biggest risk is this game not being completed. \n\nI've been working on this project for over two years and have restarted the project twice for different reasons. I've since brought on a programmer and have grown a fantastic community through Twitch and Youtube. I think having this many people counting on me, requesting regular updates and cheering me on has kept me on track far longer than I could have done on my own and I have no doubt it will continue to motivate me to finish. \n\nIn the end we think being open and honest is always the best course of action, especially when asking for a community to fund a large project like this. Without your help, this project can't happen, so it's only fair to keep you in the loop when we run into problems or setbacks. \n\nWe promise never to leave you in the dark about the status of the project or issues we encounter.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 2 or more", "title": "Every little bit helps", "descp": "We get it.

We had a lot of loose ends to tie up before the Farmlands would be ready to release and part of those loose ends is tidying up some back end code. Some of our features were haphazardly dropped into the game due to deadline crunches and those features are now wreaking havoc on our performance and workflow. So while we sand off the rough edges in the Farmlands, write some more quests and lore and introduce all sorts of new creatures and enemies to the zone, Moz is working hard on overhauling some of our older systems to run better for this big update."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "It's April Already!? - Reward Updates!", "update_content": "Hey everyone,\n\nThis is a pretty big announcement to make and it's taken me a few days to figure out everything that needs to be said.\n\nTL;DR: My wife is going through some medical problems and I'm juggling family and the game the best I can right now.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the EU (EU/UK backers), China (Asia backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic Faithful pledge. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address. Also keep in mind that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose. \n*** For backers in China, please read this update.\n*Latin America, Africa, and ROW estimates are based on USPS rates.  If USPS is not available, these rates may change.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion.

However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays.

So if you guys share the link on your social media, post it into groups and send it to people that might be interested in the project, everyone gets something out of it! So please help up reach more people by sharing the link above!\n\n\n\n\nWe heard your feedback and we went back to the drawing board. Townbuilder Unlimited is what we came up with.\nThe Townbuilder is a web application with which you can create custom 3D printable buildings for Tabletop Games. We provide detailed 3D models in the form of small building blocks that you can then use to create the perfect building for your table. All of our buildings can be printed support free and feature playable interior.\nYou can either start from scratch or modify one of our many prepared templates to fit your needs.\nPLAY\n\nWhen you back this campaign, you will get unlimited access to the Townbuilder, meaning you can build, download and print as many buildings as you want... forever. Depending on the reward tier you back at, you will gain access to different themes, which will be available to you in the Townbuilder.\n\nWe are working with  2nd Dynasty to bring SciFi into the Townbuilder! These tiles ARE NOT PART OF THE CAMPAIGN PLEDGES and will cost you 15\u20ac as an addon. For a lot more info check our update on this.\nWe have partnered up with the awesome folk from Arcane Minis who just ran the Skies of Sordane campaign.\nThrough this collab every backer that gets access to Premium Set II: Steampunk will get Steampunk themed airports added to their pledge for FREE. These will be modular as everything in the Townbuilder, allowing you to go for any width and lenght.\nBenny and his team at Arcane Minis will also create interchangeable stands that will allow the ships to dock to our buildings, raising and lowering them to fit with our 50mm height system!\nTheir Kickstarter special prices and exclusive Arcane Dragon Mini are only available until May 1st, so head on over and show them some love from us!\nCHECK OUT THE SKIES OF SORDANE LATE PLEDGES HERE\nThe usefulness of our tool relies upon a large selection of themes to choose from. There are only so many classical medieval buildings one can print before being fed up.\nThat is why our main focus for the future is expanding our themes. As a proof of concept that the Townbuilder has potential, we chose very classical themes. These are represented by our \"Basic Sets\", which are included in every pledge level and also in the free version of the Townbuilder.\nThe Basic Themes include Stone, Fachwerk, some Miscellaneous Items, and corresponding Medieval Roofs.\nCheck out our showcases below but note that they do not display all models individually as this would simply take up to much time and work.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Premium Sets will be the two choices of the community and will be modeled as soon as the Kickstarter closes. If you are a backer, you can find the link to the poll in their respective update posts or on the top of the Kickstarter campaign.\nWe don't have any 3D models to show so far since they will be modeled after... well we know what they will be.\nPremium Set I has officially been decided: It will be Sewers and Caves, for which we have some concept art below.\nPremium Set II has also been decided: It will be Steampunk, check it out below!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTownbuilder Basic\nThe Basic is free for everyone. As soon as you sign up for a free account after the Kickstarter you can try out the Townbuilder and even testprint some buildings. Obviously we want to encourage buying the Townbuilder, therefore the functionality of the Basic version is... well pretty basic.\nTownbuilder Unlimited\nThe Unlimited Version has everything you need to build hundreds of custom houses. Every functionality we think makes using the Townbuilder easier will be included here.\nTownbuilder Infinite\nThe Infinite Version adds nothing you need... but a lot of things you want. Want a 20 story high wizard tower? If your PC can handle it, knock yourself out. Want to create nice rendered pictures of your building while exploring them in first person perspective, seeing through the eyes of a miniature, here you go!  Want to create a custom sign for each guild of your world, with their custom logo and name... guess what? Townbuilder Infinite is for you.\n\n\n\n\nApprentice\nThe \"Apprentice Townbuilder\" includes the Townbuilder \"Unlimited\" Edition and all Basic sets. This tier allows you to create an endless number of buildings in the classical medieval fantasy style. Perfect for people that want to get started in the hobby or that just want to test out the tool for a low price.\nJourneyman\nThe \"Journeyman Townbuilder\" also includes the Townbuilder \"Unlimited\" Edition but a lot more models. Two additional sets are included here, which will be based on community decision so you can influence what you get. And then all Stretchgoals that will be unlocked are also included here. So if the Kickstarter takes off, you will get a lot of different models for your money, enabling you to build all kinds of different buildings.\nMaster\nThe \"Master Townbuilder\" includes the Townbuilder \"Infinite\". In this premium Townbuilder Version, you will find loads of cool features that let you enhance your gameplay. These range from a rendering studio that allows you to walk around in and outside your building and take screenshots of it, to a custom logo and text tool, which will allow you to upload your own custom logos and add them to banners and signs inside the Townbuilder. We have a lot of plans for these cool gadgety features and we already started working on some of them as the development of all basic features comes to a close.\nGuild Head\nThe \"Smith's guild head\" includes everything listed above for the Master Townbuilder and one additional feature: You get to decide two 100% custom models that we will sculpt for you and add to the Townbuilder. This can be anything you want, from a vegetable garden for your farm village to the symbol of your game's largest Kingdom as a banner to be affixed to your buildings. This allows for a whole new level of customization. Just an idea though, choose something that you want to use a lot, something that we don't feature yet and that will be a common feature for your buildings. \nSyndicate Leader\nThe \"Smith's syndicate leader\" includes everything listed above for the Master Townbuilder and one teeny tiny additional feature... You are playing a Steampunk game but the community didn't vote for the steampunk stretchgoal? Boy, do I have something for you.\nYOU GET TO COMMISSION A SET !!!!\nYes you can trust your eyes, this is an actual tier we offer. We will create a custom set for you and do our best to make it as close to your wishes as possible while still having it fit with our system.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we reach the 1000\u20ac that are necessary to keep the servers running for the coming years, the real fun begins. If you are unfamiliar with the way stretch goals work, here is a quick introduction: Whenever the campaign's funding reaches a certain threshold a stretch goal is unlocked. If we raise enough money to keep the office running for a full month, we can release an additional set at no cost, that's the basic idea.\nEach stretch goal unlocked means you get more bang for your buck and we get to do what we love as a job, win-win!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have partnered with the awesome folks of OTP Miniatures and Scenery to offer you guys the option to get your buildings printed!\nThough we don't offer printed Kickstarter tiers this time around, every backer of the Kickstarter will receive 10% off their first order for a building created in the Townbuilder at OTP's shop. This way you get your print at the same discount as if it was bought during the Kickstarter.\nAfter the Kickstarter we will also offer seller licenses. If you own a print shop or offer a printing service, feel free to reach out to us via info@townsmith.de .\n\n\n\n\nWe are a small company from Saarland, Germany. Our team consists of (currently four) tabletop enthusiasts, who love nerdy shit and who enhance tabletop games with 3D printing! Tom, Christopher, and Monika are computer scientists and Leevke is our intermedia designer.\nChristopher \"Korson\" Adam - PM, CEO, 3D Dev, 3D printing Enthusiast, DM\n\"Greetings! I'm the guy, who brought 3D printing to Townsmith. I've been playing tabletop games, namely Dungeons and Dragons, for just about 4 years now. I found out very early that being the game master was perfect for me and I've GMd ever since.\nI soon developed a need for something more than just a piece of paper when designing my encounters. Equipped with a cheap Anet A8, I began to delve deep into 3D printing for tabletop games. From then on, my arsenal of both models and printers started growing until I got frustrated with the limited customization options for the terrain that is out there.\nFor Townsmith, I take on the role of the project manager, 3D programmer, and CEO. If anything weird happens in the Townbuilder, yeah that's most likely my fault.\"\nTom \"Zatho\" Zahlbach, CTO, Webdeveloper - Fullstack, DM, Player, Documentation Enthusiast\n\"Hey, I'm Tom. I'm the guy that had to read around 300 pages of Amazon Web Services documentation to get this project hosted for all of you. So yeah, I am somewhat of a masochist ... but, I also got to code a bunch which, if anything in this world, I adore. Everything website-related and invisible to you, as well as all the things behind the website, are written mostly by me. Additionally, I also take care of our AWS infrastructure. In my free time, I play D&D 5e with my friends both as a player and as a DM\nFor Townsmith I take on the role of CTO. Which... well, says not much since I get to help with everything that needs to be worked on.\"\nMonika \"Her Smolness\" Unruh - Lead 3D Artist, Dice Enthusiast, Player\n\"Hey I'm Monika, I'm a Scorpio and 1,62 m tall, whatever you want to do with that information. I've known Tom and Christopher since school and started playing DnD with them in 2017, which made me become a dice-hoarder. When the two of them came up with the idea of Townsmith I was really hyped about it. Half-jokingly I asked them if they needed someone to help with the 3D modeling since I'm somewhat of an artistic person and was interested in trying digital art and 3D modeling.\nTo my surprise, they said yes and so I came on board and am now a 3D modeler for Townsmith, but I'm still learning, so if the models start floating randomly that's probably on me.\"\nOliver \"Ore\" Inglen - Master of the positive aura\n\"Hello, my name is Oliver. I am new to the world of tabletops, dungeons and dragons, but have been working in 3D and modeling for many years. Actually, I was working in the field of architectural modeling and visualizations until a mutual friend brought me to Christopher. Since then I have been working on my sculpturing techniques for modeling your feature blocks and will also do some concept art! I am really happy to be able to support the Townsmith team while doing fun work. If you have any suggestions for details, get in touch with me. Can\u00b4t wait to model all this!\"\nLeevke \"Insomnyu\" Reher - Concept Artist, Supporting 3D Artist, Meme Enthusiast\n\"Ahoy! I'm Leev! My full name is Leevke Fee Thordis Reher but that's kinda overkill, so call me Leev. I've been playing lots of Pen&Paper in my early childhood but couldn't seem to find a fitting group when I got older. But in 2018, I was introduced to Christopher and his great dedication to Dungeons and Dragons. Since I'm currently studying InterMedia Design, the opportunity to do my internship at Townsmith presented itself.\nI joined shortly before the Kickstarter launched, so until now I did some of the concept art. Later I'll dive into some of the 3D Modeling and digital design for the community voted themes. So if there's anything wrong, blame the others, I'm innocent.\"\nIf you have any questions about us or what we do, feel free to join our Discord Server and get in touch with us!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs you can clearly see, we are a very young team.\nThis is our first project though not our first Kickstarter campaign. A few months ago we already launched a Kickstarter with a different business model. We have learned a lot since then and we also improved the Townbuilder.\n\nStill, we are inexperienced by industry standards (Printable Scenery, Heroforge, Fat Dragon Games, etc.). Though we do our best to be responsive and professional, but our lack of experience will be visible when it comes to some aspects.\nWill the site be up 100% of the time? I doubt it.\nWill we fix it as soon as it goes down? Yes, we will.\nWill the range of themes increase as fast as heroforge's does? Well, it depends. It took us about three months to get the current models going, but we have gotten a lot faster at it and we will have more time to invest into modeling since there will be less programming work to do.\n\nMost importantly: The Townbuilder is basically ready for release weeks before the launch of the Kickstarter and we only need to polish up a few things, including the UX.

The most common issues are production delays due to plastic quality, shipping delays due to vessel schedules and weather, and customs clearance when the goods arrive at ports around the world. There is always the potential that one or more of these things could cause a delay in the delivery of pledges to backers. When these types of delays do affect campaigns, we're quick to update backers with the current situation.\n\nFinally, while it's unfortunate, it isn't uncommon for first printing of games, whether they're Kickstarted or not, to have small typos and print errors.

Designed by Eric M. Lang and Andrea Chiarvesio, Marvel United is a fast-paced cooperative game where players take control of Marvel Super Heroes and band together to thwart the master plans of the most dangerous Villains in the universe. With an all-new visual take by Edouard Guiton, brought to life in fantastic sculpts, Marvel United will challenge you and your friends. Only by standing united will you have any chance of victory! \nLearn more about the Optional Buys: Return of the Sinister Six , The Infinity Gauntlet, Enter the Spider-Verse, Rise of the Black Panther, Guardians of the Galaxy Remix, Tales of Asgard, Playmat, Cardboard Locations\nPLAY\n\n Marvel United: The Core Heroes of Marvel United | The Core Villains of Marvel United | Designing the Heroes \n The Infinity Gauntlet: Learn the Secrets of the Infinity Gauntlet  | Rise of the Infinity Gauntlet \n Other: The Initial Promos of Marvel United \nMarvel United, The Infinity Gauntlet, Tales of Asgard, Guardians of the Galaxy Remix, Rise of the Black Panther, Enter the Spider-Verse, initial Promos, and Stretch Goals\nElektra, Kingpin, Daredevil, and America Chavez\nReturn of the Sinister Six, Squirrel Girl, and Doctor Strange\nNote that anything marked with this: \nis an exclusive item for Kickstarter backers (or from other crowdfunding platforms), with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only. \n\n\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic pledge. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address. Also keep in mind that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\nTo learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.\n                                                                      \u00a9 2020 MARVEL", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 42nd Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as:\nProduction delays\nShipping delays\nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is March 2021, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. All \u201cNo Reward\u201d pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms please do not pledge on this project, but instead wait for the retail release.\n\nTo make sure you have the best gaming experience, all CMON products are warrantied against manufacturing defects for 2 years from the of date purchase from CMON (proof of purchase required).

People admire the art. They reminisce about their own National Park trips and share travel tips. They play with the resource tokens between turns.\nOur family loves to enjoy nature and PARKS is a game that is dripping with this theme...PARKS plays remarkably smooth and the trail is different each time because of the variable setup of the trail tiles.\nPARKS is a game that will have a place on our shelf for years to come.\nThe disparate elements combine into an engrossing play that can nonetheless work with a broad array of players.

The following is meant to set expectations as it relates to this project and Kickstarter's terms of use. It outlines what you can count on from us as a creator as well as some of your responsibilities as a backer.\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change.\nYou are responsible for confirming your pledge, address and other information required to ship your rewards to you in a timely manner. If you do not confirm your rewards in the Pledge Manager within 8 weeks of the conclusion of the campaign, you agree that Keymaster will have fulfilled its obligations to you in full for payment received. We may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed.\nWe work with world class shipping partners, but they are only as good as the information they are provided. It is your responsibility to monitor the project's status and update your address as needed prior to fulfillment. The best way to monitor the project's status is to read our Kickstarter Updates. Should you provide an incorrect or out of date address, you will be responsible for costs incurred if a reshipment or reroute is need.\nThat said, even with world class partners and correct addresses, shipments are sometimes damaged or lost. If any part of your order, other than a game box, is damaged upon opening, we will provide free replacement parts.\nIf ever a shipment is not marked as delivered, we will cover the cost of reshipment. Additionally, we will cover the cost of 1 re-shipment for any lost or stolen package within 2 weeks of the package being marked as delivered and after our shipping partners conduct an investigation with the carrier.\nOur Goal is for you to be the first in the world to play our games. As such, we will not sell and deliver PARKS Expansion: Nightfall or PARKS Memories at any convention or on our webstore until we have delivered games to a majority of our Backers. Additionally, we will not release PARKS Expansion: Nightfall or PARKS Memories in retail until 30 days after the majority of fulfillment in a given country is complete.\n\nKickstarter Video Credits:\nVideo Production: Brian Davis\nVideo Music: Oh, Jeremiah", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf you are reading this, then you are seriously considering our project.

With the materials, codes, and clues hidden inside, you must use your ingenuity and match the objects to solve the case.\nWith this model, we want to expand the possibilities of traditional Escape Rooms. By not being dependent on a physical space we have greater freedom to: create complex, different and surprising puzzles, a more sophisticated story and we can make the game reach all over the world.\nKey Enigma: Hack Forward is an experience as much as a game. Face the challenge by yourself or with a trustworthy group.\n The box is the heart of the project where you will find the material that serves as a bridge to connect the physical and digital world to live an immersive experience.\nHere you\u2019ll find some examples of the puzzles and materials you will find in the box to solve the challenges that the adventure requires:\nTraditional puzzles\nSimilar to those found in the traditional Escape Rooms: Logic puzzles, reveal messages, interact with objects, use pencil and paper\u2026 \n Immersive / Digital puzzles \nPuzzles that will make you doubt the limits between reality and fiction; exploring websites, news, videos or spying on security cameras. Even in some cases, you will have to use everyday tools such as your email, social networks, chats or mobile phone\u2026  \n Codes \nFind keys to decrypt secret ciphers, Morse codes, strange runes, braille, binary code or use the everyday objects like the periodic table or a chessboard to unravel a secret message.\nAdvanced Puzzles\nIf we manage to reach certain objectives we can add more complex puzzles which could include magnets, embarking on missions in the real world, receiving phone calls, among other amazing surprises. \nSome of the puzzles shown above are examples. We don't want to show you the final puzzles of Hack Forward to not spoil your experience. \nTo make progress on the story, you must investigate and solve a series of puzzles. The enigmatic objects in the box will help you solve the mysteries online and vice versa. Therefore it will be necessary to have a device with a good internet connection and the box.\nThe game can be played solo or with a group of friends, is recommended for people over 14 years old and is available in English, Spanish, German, French, and Portuguese. \nIt is not necessary to be an expert at any particular subject, you just need to accept the challenge and get involved and understand that your decisions can alter the course of the story.\nThe game is primarily a one-time use game like the real Escape Rooms but it can be resettable, to add replay-ability, so you can see the different ramifications of the story or just lend it to someone else to experience.\nThe digital puzzles can be reset with a button on our website. The physical objects in the box won\u2019t suffer damage playing, but some papers will suffer damage, so at the end of each chapter, you will find the PDF files so you can print them again at home.\nMore than 8 hours of investigation and fun, divided into 8 chapters. Like traditional Escape Rooms, the clock is ticking and your time will be registered at the end of each chapter, although this is optional. For those up to the competition, this is the ultimate ranking. Time will not run between chapters, so you can take a break and continue later. \nIf you get stuck, do not worry, you can interact with the characters in the story and ask for advice. They will give you clues and hints to help you move forward.\nIf you want to get a taste of the immersion of the game here you have the chance for free. The DEMO can be completed totally online without the box but it\u2019s nothing compared to the whole experience with the box. \nhttps://keyenigma.com/hackforward/chapterone\nMore than 4000 people have already played the first chapter and only 30% of participants have successfully completed it on time. The average time is 1 hour. Can you beat that record? \nIn our first adventure, titled Hack Forward, there has been a worldwide cyberattack. Massive data filtration has affected from Nuclear power plants to ordinary citizens. Anyone with a smart device can be a target.\nYou will put yourself in the shoes of an investigator whose predecessor has disappeared under strange circumstances. You must continue with the investigation and find those responsible for the massive leaks that threaten the security of the world. \nBut soon you\u2019ll discover that those leaks are a smokescreen for something much more dangerous. Who is behind all this? What could be so important? We can\u2019t tell you any more without spoilers, but if you like conspiracy theories, science fiction and plot twists you will love this one.\nDive into this immersive experience that will make you question a real problem. Our personal data is on the Internet and any camera device may be recording you at this time. The idea of this story is based on how vulnerable we are to it. Is technology getting too powerful that it will overrule us?\nThe story will be divided into 8 chapters. Each one has its own objective and different challenges that can be completed in 1 hour, like a traditional Escape Room. You can play them all in a row or you can take a break and play another day. \nBy not depending on spatial and temporal limitations like other Escape Rooms, we are able to have greater freedom to improve.  \n\nShipping is charged as part of this Kickstarter campaign. You just have to select your reward and then your Country (or \"Rest of the world\") and the shipping price is automatically added to the pledge.\nYour shipping address will be collected after the Kickstarter ends and we close to the delivery date.\nIf you want to get two copies of the game go to FAQ section for details.\nThe European Union, USA and Canada will be \u201cShipping Friendly\u201d. Backers from these countries will not pay import taxes. We will be using fulfillment center partners to ship locally for each country.\nOutside of the EU, USA and Canada we cannot guarantee customs friendly shipping in these areas. There may be additional duties and/or fees charged by your country's governmental agencies and/or shipping partners that will be your responsibility.\n For Retail shops buying packs of 6 or more boxes send us an email at contact@keyenigma.com\nWe are a startup that aims to launch different Escape Games themes (Terror, Adventure, Detective,...) that resemble the Escape Room experience but right in your home.\nOr even explore the possibilities of launching a subscription box with bi-monthly shippings.\nBut this project can only be carried if we get enough support through Kickstarter.\n Why do we do it? \nAs big fans of Escape Rooms and Escape Games sometimes we encountered limitations for playing as often as we wished. Such restrictions encouraged us to embark on this project:\n Location: Most of the time we are limited to playing in our city or surroundings, and assembling a group of friends to go to a faraway Escape Room seems impossible.  Key Enigma box is at the best location: your home.\n Variety & Innovation: Once you have played many traditional Escape Rooms they all start feeling the same. Our game is a breath of fresh air that will surprise you.\n Cost: Escape Rooms are expensive! Our game is a fraction of the price.\n Main Inspirations \nThe night of October 30th, 1938 gave us the most famous radio broadcast in history: \"War of the Worlds\" by Orson Welles.\nOrson Welles certainly understood all the possibilities radio could offer and knew how to use it to carry out a very different entertainment experience from what people were used to. What we want to do now is to present a similar experience using the multiple communication options we have available nowadays.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf you're new to Kickstarter: you can support our game by selecting one of the rewards we have prepared for you. If we reach our funding goal of \u20ac28500, you will enable us to develop the game from start to finish in every detail according to our vision.\n\nThe amount of money you spend will only be collected if we reach our goal you will receive your rewards once the game is released. However, if we fail to reach our goal, your contribution won't be charged at all.\n\nThis is not our first rodeo, Albert Benitez former co-founder and CEO of Stream Hatchet, knows how to handle deadlines, and has a very specific plan of attack for this new project. And the amazing team that surrounds him has experience writing novels and scripts from start to finish and they also build Escape Rooms in their city. The team has the skills necessary to complete the vision of the company.\n\nWe have already finished the writing of Hack Forward game and we are only missing a few puzzles that need some specific elaborations regarding quality and technology.\n\nOur biggest challenges to complete the game are:\n\n- Manufacturing and design: we want to make this game available at an affordable price. We have to talk with lots of providers and get a fair price because we want to include quality components, physical objects, and elaborate puzzles.\n- Technology: we must form a credible digital universe in addition to testing and programming web pages, chats, email responses,\u2026 These components are being developed in house to bring the prices down due to the experience we have elaborating on similar technological projects. \n- Narrative: We want to naturally blend narrative, puzzles and technology to form a credible and immersive story given the tight budget.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac45 or more", "title": "The Box", "descp": "EN: You will get our Box (35% discount off retail price)\n---\nESP: Recibir\u00e1s nuestra Caja (35% de descuento respecto al precio de venta)\nINCLUDES:\nKey Enigma: Hack Forward", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["750 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac60 or more", "title": "Collaboration Box", "descp": "EN: You will get our Box and the last three releases of Cryptogram Puzzles Post series (Created by Jack Fallows).

Plus, a new, never-before-seen Graphic Novel Adventure book... Sherlock Holmes: The Beginning!\nIn Sherlock Holmes: Baker Street Irregulars, you'll work together with the other players to explore the city of London and solve mysteries, in an effort to prove yourselves to the world's greatest detective.\nHere are some key features of the game:\n Contents include: Four (4) 96-page softcover books, 1 map, 1 Mission briefing and solutions book\n Family-friendly gameplay for 1-4 players ages 8 and up. Also highly enjoyable for grown \"kids at heart\" like most of us gamers are!\n Virtually no setup time and minimal rules! Start playing in as little as 5 minutes.\n Great character choices! Play as one of four street urchins each with their own book and a different talent that will make your personal experience differ from that of the other players.\n Play multiple cases (4) as you explore the mean streets of London and experience hours of case-solving fun.\n A multi-player gamebook experience... if you always wished you could share your gamebook experiences with your friends than you are going to absolutely love our cooperative Graphic Novel Adventures games and this game takes it to a whole new level.\nSo how does it all work?\nSherlock has some casework for the Irregulars. It is up to you, to prove your worth.\nYou'll each choose one of the four Irregulars (it is ok if you have fewer players and only choose some, or even one!).\nWiggins has begun to master the art of deduction under Holmes's tutelage.\nMyrtle is a master of disguise and can help the Irregulars slip past all but the most observant.\nIke is particularly good at throwing a beatdown on foes of the Irregulars, or providing some muscle.\nVicky is an expert at climbing and acrobatics, allowing her to spot things for the group.\nNow you are ready to play! Select a Mission from the mission book and set out across London to solve the mystery.\nPlayers will need to be on the lookout for how their special skill can help the group.\nClick to see a larger version!\nAfter you've completed a mission decide to move on to the next or save your place and continue later.\nFor the first time, you can see where it all began. The entire line of Sherlock GNAs take place after the famed dive off of Reichenbach Falls, where Sherlock and Moriarty allegedly plunged to their deaths. Now you can see what happened after those incredible events, and how Sherlock got back in the investigatory saddle, through the eyes of his trusted friend, Dr. Watson.\nSherlock trusts you to prove your deductive prowess and solve cases that have left Inspector Lestrade, and Scotland Yard, puzzled to say the least. Be careful though, not only are your investigations perilous, but Sherlock himself has little tolerance for failure. However you choose to go about solving the mysteries, as always, it's your story, your choices, and your adventure.\nWe want to make this as simple as possible, so there are just three options for pledging.\nWe know it's holiday season, and many of us are running around looking for the perfect gift still. If this looks like a great gift for someone in your life but you're worried about having something under the tree, fear not. We have this handy holiday certificate for you, so you can have something to give one of those special people in your life while they wait to crack the case on Baker Street.\nClick on the image for a Hi-Res download.\nThe game has multiple missions to experience.  You can get a lot of play from each of the missions and you will also want to experience them both alone, and with your friends, as the experience differs somewhat in each format. It all adds up to many hours of enjoyment for you, your family, your friends, and your game group!\nShipping will be charged separately in our post-campaign pledge manager at a later date. Above are our estimated shipping rates for each region. For those outside the USA, we highly encourage bundling both products as shipping is only a few dollars more. We provide friendly shipping to USA, Canada, Australia, the European Union, and select countries in Asia.\nEU Includes: United Kingdom, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden\nRest of Asia Includes: Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam\n Sherlock Holmes: Baker Street Irregulars is a fully developed Graphic Novel Adventures cooperative game contained within four books and is our English translation of the game recently released in France from publishers Makaka Editions and Blue Orange Europe. We will not be offering stretch goals for this campaign. \nInstead of stretch goals, throughout the campaign, we will be revealing additional info about the game and a few special surprises!\nThe books for Baker Street Irregulars are softcover with good quality and Sherlock: The Beginning is a hardcover book.  The map for Baker Street Irregulars is printed on card stock and the cardboard box has a magnetized enclosure and is of good quality with color printing inside and out. We've learned that sometimes quality issues may arise unexpectedly, but as with all of our products, we stand behind the quality and if there are any issues we will happily take care of you and replace any defective items.\nOur retailer offer for this project is only available to retailers in the USA and Canada. \nVan Ryder Games offers Retailers the ability to get our products through our VRG Select Retailer program and you can pre-order the products from this Kickstarter. A VRG Select Retailer is a retailer that has the ability to order games directly from us through our Retailer-only webstore.

Communication is of the utmost importance to us. Please ask any and all questions and we will answer as quickly as possible.\n2. Our stretch goal items are determined by us before the campaign begins, in the event all of them are achieved we will not add more as it puts our project timeline and cost at risk.\n3.

Completing your survey late at any point beyond the deadline we communicate AND/OR failure to pay shipping in a timely manner when the surveys are reopened, could result in significant delays in receiving your rewards, additional shipping expense, duties, taxes, or other fees to be paid by you, and you will not be eligible for a refund for any reason. We give plenty of time to complete the survey, so please do so in a timely manner to avoid any inconvenience or delay. Any survey that is not completed within 30 days from final fulfillment (defined as the last date of shipping of KS rewards for your region) will result in your pledge being considered abandoned and any amount pledged will be considered a gift in support of the project.\n\nBy pledging to this project you understand the risks, challenges, and pledge terms we have laid out here, and agree to be bound by them.

Check out the Videos section further down the page! \n\n\nThe new Museum campaign offers several pledge levels. The pledge you should choose will depend on whether you already have Museum (whether you backed the first campaign or purchased it in retail), or if you live somewhere in the world where Museum is not available yet! If you would simply like to pick and choose individual items without opting for a full pledge level you can do that too, so there\u2019s something for everyone!\nTo decide which pledge level you need, simply choose which of the statements below applies to you, then choose the option you would like!\nI'M FROM THE USA, CANADA, FRANCE, UK, BELGIUM, SWITZERLAND\nEven though this is a \u201creprint\u201d campaign, we\u2019ve decided to do things a little bit differently.\nIn order to support our distribution partners and stores, backers from countries where the game is distributed will not be able to acquire any of the retail content during the campaign. We will not be selling the Core Game or any of the expansions available in retail (The Black Market, The Archaeologists, The People\u2019s Choice, or The World\u2019s Fair).\nThis ensures that our KS will not be detrimental to all those that help us continue to make Museum a success months after its release.\nSo, if you live in the USA, Canada, England, France, Luxembourg or Switzerland and you don\u2019t have Museum yet, we ask that you go out and purchase the core game and expansions from your FLGS! Just walk in and if they don\u2019t have any copies in stock they can order them for you from their distributor.\nYou can also purchase Museum easily through one of these online stores:\nUSA - Miniature Market \n Canada - 401 Games \nFrance/Belgium/Luxembourg/Switzerland - Philibert \n UK - Gameslore \nYou may, of course, purchase anything you like from this campaign to complete your collection.

You can check out our article HERE.\nDispite moving foward with the second edition, we've also prepared an FAQ for the original rules which you can find HERE. \n Shipping costs are not included in your pledge. We have however done  our best to keep the costs as low as possible. After the campaign has  concluded we will ask you to pay for shipping during the \"Pledge Manager\" phase.\nWe are aiming to deliver Kickstarter content (old and new) by November 2020. This may seem like a long time as a lot of the game is already available, However, knowing the intricacies of board game design, manufacturing and shipping, we'd  rather include a good margin of error in our estimations in order to avoid disappointment.\nAny retail content will be shipped with the Kickstarter content. \n\"Friendly Shipping\" means that you'll pay no import tax in Europe, the US & Canada.\nThe chart below shows the maximum estimated cost of  shipping the game to your region. This is barring any unforeseen  circumstances outside of our control. Exact costs will be indicated during the pledge manager phase and but we hope to be able to provide you  with prices lower than what is indicated here.\nFor the purchase of a small component \"a la carte\" Shipping costs should start around:\nGroup 1 \u2013 6.5\u20ac\nGroup 2 \u2013 7\u20ac\nGroup 3 \u2013 8\u20ac\nRoW \u2013 9\u20ac", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEXPERIENCE\n\nThis is not our first Kickstarter. This is HGG's seventh project so we are very familiar with the running and fulfilment of a KS project as well as where to look for any potential pitfalls. We currently have three other ongoing Kickstarter projects: Titan, Dominations and Rallyman: GT. Titan is currently in pre-production. Dominations and Rallyman: GT are currently being shipped to distribution centres with fulfillment beginning not long after this campaign ends. We are active on all three pages, providing regular updates, answering questions and generally keeping our backers informed at each stage of the project.\n\nDELIVERY DATE\n\nWe're estimating a November 2020 delivery date. This corresponds to the time we believe will be necessary to prepare the game for manufacturing, produce it and ship it to you. It also includes a safety margin too in case we come across any unforeseen circumstances.\nIt is in our best interests to get the game to our backers as soon as possible and we will do our utmost to deliver before this date and/or ensure that there are no delays. However, it may be that a situation arises that is out of our control, such as issues with shipping, customs or problems at the factory. Should anything cause this date to change we will of course keep you updated.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nAll pledges can be refunded -minus KS and Strype fees (10%)- up until the closing date of the Pledge Manager, no questions asked. After that date we will not be able to process refunds.\nIf, for any reason, we are unable to produce the game we will provide a full refund to all our backers.\n\nBEHAVIOUR\n\nWe always welcome feedback and constructive criticism of our projects and games. However, we will not tolerate the abuse or harassment of HGG, it's staff or other participants of this Kickstarter. HGG reserves the right to refund and remove any person found in violation of these standards.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAny costs shown in $ are based on the exchange rate in effect during the first day of the campaign.\nBy pledging to this Kickstarter, you acknowledge that the final appearance, materials and content of the rewards are subject to change and may differ from what is presented whilst the Kickstarter project is active.\n\nYou agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "A la Carte US/CAN/ENG/FR", "descp": "I AM from: - USA - Canada - England - France - Belgium - Switzerland\nAnd want KS exclusive content from this campaign and the previous one.

So in this version of Trip 1907: Forbidden Mine you will find:\nA new, faster, website has been added with no registration required.\nArt \"Seals\" have been added to pages, in order to distinguish a riddle page from an art and story page.\nThe \"sanity\" token hint exchange system is now on the hard copy.

The game design started nine months ago and the funds from this campaign will support all the expenses for the creation of this game. In this way delivery is a primary issue to us and will be done through Amazon & KDP separately for every backer of this project. Main goal is to complete all the delivery process on December 2019.

Expansion introduces for the very first time for Zombicide a story-driven campaign, full of flavorful and impactful surprises and choices, in addition to advanced rules, new characters and an iconic location.\nWant to develop your Survivors and dive even deeper in the story? Zombicide: Chronicles - The Roleplaying Game explores the world of Zombicide and the hardships of living in a world wrecked by the infestation.\nFind out more about these Optional Buys in the following links: Travel Zombicide, Fort Hendrix Expansion, Daily Zombie Spawn Set, Chronicles Survivor Set, Urban Legends Abominations, Extra Players Upgrade Set, Field Guide to Zombicide RPG, Full Metal Dice Set, Silver Metal Dice, Golden Metal Dice, Special Black and White Dice, Danny Trejo Set, 3D Cars, Shooter Zombies Set, All-Out Dice, Zombies & Companions Upgrade Kit. \nZombicide: Chronicles - The Roleplaying Game is designed by Francesco Nepitello, Marco Maggi and Need Games.\nNote that anything marked with this:\nis an exclusive item for Kickstarter backers (or from other crowdfunding platforms), with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only. \nThe Roleplayer Pledge Optional Buy is meant for Reboot or Nostalgic backers wishing to just add the RPG to their collection. This will contain any Stretch Goals unlocked for the regular Roleplayer pledge. \nThe Washington Z.C. Optional Buy is meant for Nostalgic backers, wishing to play the expansion with one of their 1st Edition core boxes. Please note that, in order to set up many of the the Washington Z.C. Missions properly, you'll need the 2nd Edition Tiles Set, below: \nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes, based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic pledge. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address. Also keep in mind that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose. \nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan. \nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. All \u201cNo Reward\u201d pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms please do not pledge on this project, but instead wait for the retail release.\n\nTo make sure you have the best gaming experience, all CMON products are warrantied against manufacturing defects for 2 years from the of date purchase from CMON (proof of purchase required).

Monsters are lurking around every corner. You will need to enlist mighty heroes to empower your ranks and defeat the monsters.\nLast but not least, you will need to find rare dragon eggs, hatch them, and train your dragons to become formidable companions.\nWith the help of an army of heroes, you will save the faeries and use their magic to explore the world and build a mighty empire!\nSpring is upon us! As the flowers blossom, empires will rise!\nDwar7s Spring is language independent. The game's cards have no text. As such, with just the rulebook you will be able to play the game in all supported languages.\nInside the game's box, the rulebook will be in English. However, through our website (http://www.vesuviusmedia.com) or the Hive Portal (http://www.hiveinteractive.net) you will be able to download the rulebook for the core game and its expansions in several supported languages (eg. English, Portuguese, French, German, Greek, Spanish, Italian, and more).\nWith your support we have unlocked both the Alchemist and the Dragon classes! These miniatures are added to the Enchanted Forest and the Elven Uprising expansions!\n\nLearn how to play by watching the following video:\nClick on the image to go to Tabletopia and give the game a try!\nClick the image to download the rulebook\n Kickstarter Previews\nOne Dream, Four Seasons!\nOur vision for the world of Dwar7s is to create 4 different stand-alone games, one for each of the four seasons. The games will not require each other to be played, but story develops through the seasons. \nWe started our story with Dwar7s Fall (2016), which is a worker-placement, hand management game with take-that. In Dwar7s Fall you are a dwarf, trying to build your kingdom, while at the same time gathering provisions because the winter is coming!\nIn Dwar7s Winter (2018), a semi co-op, hand-building, miniature game, you are faced with a harsh winter and need to work with your fellow dwarfs to survive. You have to gather your allies and defend your castle from raging monsters that are trying to overtake it. At the same time, you need to repair damage done to your city by various disasters (blizzards, hurricanes, snow storms, volcanoes and more). Although you are working together to survive the 7 weeks of winter, at the end of the game (if you manage to survive!), the player with the most victory points is declared the winner.\nAfter Dwar7s Spring (2019), our plans include Dwar7s Summer, to be released next year. As soon as we finish all 4 seasons, we will release Dwar7s World! Dwar7s World will be a campaign where you play through all 4 seasons. Starting in the fall as a young Dwarf Worker, you will gather experience points as you play through the seasons and strive to become a great Dwarven King/Queen by the end of summer!\nFor information on Retail Pledge Levels: https://www.vesuviusmedia.com/kickstarter/retailers\nFor information on group orders:    https://www.vesuviusmedia.com/kickstarter/group-orders\nComponents are from the Up your Game collection! These components can also be used with many other boardgames to enhance your experience!\nIf you missed the Dwar7s Winter Kickstarter campaign, this is your chance to get the expansion! Keep in mind that the Legendary Expansion is FULLY compatible with Dwar7s Spring too! This add-on includes the cards from the \"Legendary Conversion Pack\".\n* If you missed the Dwar7s Winter Kickstarter, this add-on gets you everything from the Winter Season, including the \"Legendary Conversion Pack\" shown below.\n* If you already have the Kickstarter Edition of Dwar7s Winter, you need this pack to use the monsters and the classes from the Legendary Expansion with Dwar7s Spring.\n* This set of Dwarfs minis is exactly the same as the one included with Dwar7s Winter. Dwar7s Spring comes with punchboard tokens for your dwarfs. If you have the Dwar7s Winter game, then you can use that set to play Spring, or you can purchase a 2nd set with this add-on.\nThese sleeves work with ALL seasons and editions of the Dwar7s Series\n The following is a list of the number of cards per game:\nDwar7s Spring: 136\nEnchanted Forest Expansion: 80-100 (depending on SGs)\nConversion Pack: 20\nLegendary Expansion: 40\nDwar7s Winter: 84\nElven Uprising: 37\n3rd Edition comes in a big box that includes the core game and the Royal Decree Expansion. The box has enough room to fit all the other expansions of the season!\nWe will charge shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. Payment will be collected via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. Shipping costs vary widely based on where you will receive your reward. Unfortunately, a one size fits all price isn't manageable.\nWe will pay to ship your rewards to our international distribution centers. Based on your delivery address, we will ship to you from one of the hubs below:\nUK: GamesQuest\nAsia: VFI\nAustralia: Aetherworks\nCanada: Snakes & Lattes\nUSA: QuarterMaster\nGermany, Rest of Europe & Rest of the World: Happyshops\nUK & Brexit:\nThe delivery time of the game is scheduled for May 2020. Right now, the UK is in an unstable and unknown status as far as its relationship with the EU is concerned. There is no way for us to predict how this is going to end and what repercussions this might inflict on shipping. Our goal is to bring the games into the EU and then find the best way to transfer them to the UK. We are monitoring the situation and will let you know more when we do.\nBrazilian Backers:\nWe are going to be using VFI to give you Custom-Friendly shipping solution. We understand that this might take a little longer to be fulfilled but at least there will be NO custom fees and extra surprise charges for your pledge!\nCurrently, just like the Dwar7s Fall Collector's Edition, Dwar7s Spring will NOT be published by Mandala Jogos within Brazil.\nThe following is a list of rough estimates for shipping of the basic pledge. Please keep in mind that these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional add-ons you choose. All prices are listed in US dollars.\nHawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico and other remote states are not part of the \"US\" category. They are included in the \"Rest of the world\" category.\nPlease note, the core game and stretch goals will be in separate game boxes. We expect the shipping box will be 29 cm x 29 cm x 16 cm. The estimated shipping rates below are based on this large box size.\nPICKUP LOCATIONS\nIf you happen to be close to any of the following locations, then you can choose the \"Pick up\" pledge and not pay shipping costs!\nHalifax, Canada\n The Board Room Cafe: 1256 Barrington St, Halifax NS, B3J 1Y6\n Cape & Cowl Collectibles: 536 Sackville Dr, Lower Sackville NS, B4C 2R8\nWe will ask you to specify the exact pick up location in the pledge manager after the end of the campaign.\nAthens, Greece\n \u039a\u03ac\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1 \u03a0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03ac: \u0391\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 11, 18535, \u03a0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2 (\u03c4\u03b7\u03bb. 210 4296845)\n No Label X: \u039c\u03c0\u03cc\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7 4, 106 82, \u0391\u03b8\u03ae\u03bd\u03b1\n Meeple on Board: \u03a0\u03b9\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae 7, 17122, \u039d\u03ad\u03b1 \u03a3\u03bc\u03cd\u03c1\u03bd\u03b7\nWe will ask you to specify the exact pick up location in the pledge manager after the end of the campaign.\nWe want to thank all of the backers who have been supporting us and helping us create and deliver great games. That is why we created a special Loyalty program.\nWhenever you select a pledge that has the Vesuvius Media Loyalty Credit item in it, you will receive a $5 Loyalty Credit for our next Kickstarter campaign to be used for add-ons.\nThis extra credit will be visible during the checkout process of the Hive Pledge Manager and you will be able to use it to buy add-ons (it can not be used for a main pledge nor for shipping costs).\nKeep in mind that the Loyalty Credit is per campaign and not per game. This means that if you backed us only in one campaign, even if you added all three games in a bundle, you will receive $5 credit. We do this to be fair to backers who have paid more shipping costs by supporting us in multiple campaigns.\nIf you have Loyalty Credit from previous campaigns and choose not to use it in this one, then you will have an additional $5 for the next one.\nTo be eligible for the Loyalty credit, you must pledge for a reward during this campaign. Late-pledges and pledges of $1 will not qualify for any type of Loyalty credit (credit from past campaigns or credit for future campaigns).\nVesuvius Media is a small (but mighty!), Canadian, indie development company. Starting off by producing online strategy games, Vesuvius Media has branched into new areas of production and currently boasts online games, mobile games, graphic novels and board games in its portfolio.\nWhat makes Vesuvius Media different from all the other companies? Vesuvius Media is community-driven. Whether online or on the table, its game designers and developers interact with players, listen, debate, and continually gather feedback. Its community of players help shape the future of its games!\nTo date, Vesuvius Media has successfully Kickstarted ten (10) board game projects:\n Centauri Saga (Produced and Successfully Delivered) \n Cosmic Pioneers (Produced and Successfully Delivered) \n Dwar7s Fall (Produced and Successfully Delivered) \n Centauri Saga: Season 1 (Produced and Successfully Delivered) \n Covil: The Dark Overlords (Produced and Successfully Delivered) \n Dwar7s Winter (Produced and Successfully Delivered) \n Dwar7s Fall Collector's Edition (Produced and Successfully Delivered) \n Nocturion (Produced and Successfully Delivered) \n MonstroCity (Production under way, estimated delivery January 2020)\n Up Your Game (Production under way, estimated delivery April 2020)\nYou can check out our Kickstarter Projects' history  and stats on this cool website:\nhttps://www.tabletopanalytics.com/creator/vesuvius-media-ltd-78\nWe learn from our mistakes, we listen to your suggestions, and we strive to become better.

Supplier shortage, holiday traffic and weather conditions are just a few of the reasons a production could be delayed. Vesuvius Media Ltd should not be held responsible for delays caused by third parties. In addition, some of the items shown might differ from the final product due to supplier/manufacturer error.\n\nMISSING/DAMAGED ITEMS\n\nWhen dealing with a large number of orders, there is always a chance that errors will occur.

Inspired by genre classics, this is an online adventure that sets you adrift in an intricate fairytale world... but it\u2019s also an invitation to roleplay without the restraints of linear quests and plotlines. Feel at liberty to travel the free wilds and vivid cities of the Braided Shore peninsula. Wander deep into the layers of this hand-drawn world, stumble upon its hidden places or unravel one of its many mysteries. There is no overarching goal, no real beginning or end, and ultimately you are in charge of shaping your own journey. It\u2019s a land of elusive creatures, lush natural beauty and pastoral calm... but one that has known troubles and where shadows play their part.    \n\u201cMight and Delight\u2019s peaceful online adventure could change the way we think of multiplayer experiences.\u201d \nRachel Watts, PCgamer.com\nRight from the start, our ambition was to take the conventional elements of traditional RPGs and use them to make something new \u2013 specifically, a world where players can enjoy calm exploration, discovery, and quietly forged companionships. We knew that we wanted to offer the sensation of being a wanderer in a wild, luscious, unexplored world, where you can form friendships and overcome obstacles \u2013 alone or together.   \nWe\u2019re pleased with what we have made so far: an online RPG that focuses more on roleplaying and personality traits than on stats and numbers. There are no linear quest lines built into the game, instead we wanted Book of Travels to be a truly living world, one where you\u2019ll stumble across events and characters unexpectedly. It\u2019s up to you to follow the leads you gather and piece together the stories of Braided Shore.\nIn making our previous games we found that there\u2019s an appetite for games that allow players to delve deep into a world and to slowly thread together events, moments, and emotions into something that\u2019s all their own. With Book of Travels we\u2019re bringing the same interpretive, creative style of play to a much bigger world.\n\u201cThis is exactly what we need to challenge what people think when they think of multiplayer games\u201d  \nBree Royce, Massivelyoverpowered.com  \nWhen emotion plays a part\nYour interactions and choices will have effects that you might not expect in traditional RPGs. Acting with curiosity and thoughtfulness will evolve your character in the same way as performing tasks or undertaking endeavours. Events that are usually trivialized in RPGs are instead made into strong emotional moments. Witnessing a death, for example, will weigh more heavily on your character for each day that passes, but by visiting the deceased\u2019s resting place, your grief will be transformed into a new energy \u2013 one that will remove that weight and strengthen you instead.   \nWordless communication for richer roleplay\nWhen it comes to in-game communication, we\u2019ve found that playing with a limited range of expression makes for more involving interaction between players \u2013 that\u2019s why there\u2019s no text chat in the game. In Book of Travels, you\u2019ll communicate with other players using a unique set of emotes and symbols which are unlocked as you experience new things. This means that you\u2019ll gain symbols to express \u2018boat\u2019 and \u2018market\u2019 once you\u2019ve encountered them. We\u2019ve used this bold kind of game design before, and we fell in love with how wordless communication boosted players\u2019 creativity as they found ways to say a lot with very little. This made for a more immersive kind of roleplay and also had a very positive effect on the culture amongst our community.  \n\u201cBook of Travels clearly shows the gaming community\u2019s desire for a fresh concept for an MMORPG\u201d\nMarc Marasigan, MMOS.com \nTMORPG \u2013 Tiny Multiplayer Online\nBook of Travels also differs from traditional MMOs because of its multiplayer design. Instead, we\u2019re calling it a TMO \u2013 a Tiny Multiplayer Online. That\u2019s because there really won\u2019t be anything \u2018massive\u2019 about the multiplayer aspect of the game. Instead we\u2019re building a game experience where there will just be a few people on each server, and when you cross paths, we want it to be a memorable moment. Should you choose to wander alone you won\u2019t be missing out on any of the world\u2019s wonder and enchantment. But if you do want to form a band of Travellers, the scarcity of other folk will make your companionships special and your group\u2019s bond that much deeper.  \nYou never know what lies ahead\nAs you play you\u2019ll encounter countless randomly occurring events. These can be anything from townsfolk that pass you by, a flock of deer, a travelling merchant or an event that tells a story. Some events will inspire you to seek out particular places or follow leads, others will need immediate action and decision-making from you and your group. Events have certain conditions, such as \u2018can only appear during night\u2019 or \u2018only occurs in x location when raining\u2019. This complex design is what makes the game truly unique: it will present something different each time you play, giving every player a different story to share. Beneath this structure lie multiple large and small plotlines for you to uncover and by sharing your findings (on the game\u2019s Discord server, for example) you can start to peel back the layers of an immensely deep world of stories and secrets. We\u2019ve worked on this part of the game more than any other \u2013 making the world ever-changing, and giving it a life of its own. \n\u201dIt sounds like nothing else, this could be one of the most unique RPGs I've seen in a very long time.\u201d \nLiam Dawe, gamingonlinux.com \nCollaborate to delve deeper\nBook of Travels is meant to be played in many different ways. It\u2019s a game perfect for players who want to adventure alone, because there are no typical linear quest lines, and there\u2019s so much to experience through free exploration. But the game is also tailored to be exciting when travelling with a band of new found friends. There are events in the game that we call Endeavours. These are things that players in groups can interact with, and they can trigger a variety of outcomes. Endeavours come in four categories; Mystical, Physical, Social and Mechanical. A group might find a machine that requires them to collaborate to activate it. They might come across a boat to reach a far away island. They might simply encounter a social situation that demands more than one player. This design is a key part of our intention to create a multiplayer culture based on roleplaying, social interaction and collaboration rather than PVP.  \nBraided Shore is a fantasy world that blurs the lines between many things: between civilisation and nature, industrialism and magic, people and beings. It\u2019s a culture in which honour and humanity is celebrated, but it\u2019s not without its shadows. It\u2019s an early industrial society that has one foot firmly rooted in tradition. \nClick to enlarge\nThe region is inhabited by many spirit beings, but none are more prominent than the Sefra. Sefra are solitary and volatile and live in regions of the peninsula they have chosen to inhabit and protect. This doesn\u2019t mean that they are at odds with humans \u2013 they often live peacefully alongside them, sometimes even working with their councils \u2013 but they are known for their unpredictability and their tempers can have huge consequences. \nThere are two common types of magic in Braided Shore, but they don\u2019t belong to the realm of conventional wizardry. Knots are used as a means of communication but may also be magic. In Knotcraft, binding can be used to conjure magic energies \u2013 they are always potent and usually benign. One type of knot may conjure \u2018light\u2019 while another may conjure \u2018smoke\u2019 or \u2018shelter\u2019. Brewing tea isn\u2019t always a magical ritual either (folk love to visit tea houses or sup tea together with friends) but neither is it uncommon to perform a tea ceremony wherein a special tea is brewed to endow the drinker with wondrous abilities, such as invisibility, healing and weather resistance.\nThe Braided Shore Lore Compendium gives much more detail on these practices, their common use and their history, as well as on all things Braided Shore.   \nAs this campaign grows we will be populating an area in the game known as Travellers\u2019 Meadow with Night Flowers, one for every backer. Night Flowers are a rare find on Braided Shore and the particular blue of their petals is very unusual throughout the region. What\u2019s more, they become luminescent in warm weather, and in large clusters will illuminate any fair-weathered night.\nWe can\u2019t wait to see Travellers\u2019 Meadow fill with Night Flowers! And when you play Book of Travels, Travellers\u2019 Meadow will be your special place \u2013 a place to rest, meet up with other Travellers. So back us and watch the empty meadow shimmer with the blue glow of Night Flowers!  \n7,000+ Night Flowers in Travellers\u2019 Meadow\nMany have likened the gameview to a living picture book \u2013 a perfect summary! Technically, this is because the game uses a camera that only moves in two dimensions, creating an almost orthographic field of view, and mixing 3D spaces with flat 2D sprites. Regardless of definition, the way the game looks and is navigated is quite rare.\nOur inspiration started with classic isometric RPGs, but we wanted to find a way to bring a more cinematic scope to the scenes. Using a unique mix of techniques, we\u2019ve designed Book of Travels to make your character feel small, letting the landscape around you play a bigger role. The experience is much like walking freely inside a page in a book, taking in the richly illustrated world around you.\nWe\u2019re proud to share some of the art from the development phase below!

Founded by artists in 2010, the studio is comprised of people from all kinds of different backgrounds. We have released seven games, all of which have a highly crafted visual style and explore emotionally engaging themes such as loss, freedom and solitude. Few of these games fit neatly into genres, but what they have in common is the way they allow players to explore, to speculate and to reflect.  \nOur experienced team has worked for leading game studios and has together shipped over 40+ games outside of Might and Delight.\nThis isn\u2019t our first online game: Meadow, now in its fourth year, connected players who loved the Shelter games allowing them to explore together, communicating with emotes and unlocking magical obelisks. We had no idea that Meadow would go on to bring so much enjoyment for such a long time. We\u2019ve been overwhelmed by the stories and artwork that Might and Delight players have made and shared \u2013 it\u2019s really shown us how rich and deep this kind of gameplay can be! Making Meadow and getting to know its community have inspired us to make a TMO of a much different, much bigger kind. \nMight & Delight games wouldn\u2019t be what they are without the input of our community \u2013 put simply, community support and feedback help us design better games. We want to invite more people in at an earlier stage of development, so that you can help us make the game that you want to play.\nWe\u2019re already funded enough to get us through production, but this campaign will mean the game can evolve and expand, because we\u2019ll be listening to your ideas and adding them into the world... Which of course means you get to play a bigger and better game, but also that you\u2019ll know that you helped to create it!\nWe\u2019ve been working on these rewards for a long time now. developing them to help enrich your game experience and help you get to know the Braided Shore. Please take a look and see which one might suit you best!    \nMemento and signed artwork:\nWe will release Book of Travels in 2020 and we\u2019re also looking into offering an early access launch. When the campaign is over we\u2019ll keep backers updated with development milestones. After release, the game will be available on Steam for $30.00 and wherever you buy Book of Travels, there will be no subscription fee.\nWe will continue to evolve the world, its lore and its backstory, adding events and levels for years to come.

I'm so excited to return with another Kickstarter in a series of Kickstarters I have planned for my Birthstone Goddesses collection!  For my previous Kickstarters, my fans helped to create a Birthstone Goddesses coloring book and the first pins in a set of 12 enamel pins inspired by this same project.\nFor those who don't know me, I'm the artist and author of Angelic Visions, a howto book that teaches readers how to paint fantasy angels.  Now, I'm working on a body of work called the Birthstone Goddesses.  Each goddess embodies a month of the year reflecting the folklore, flowers, and birthstones for her respective month.\nThe entire series of Birthstone Goddesses!\nYou can keep up with the BIRTHSTONE GODDESSES project and the future plans I have for it at:\n| Website | Twitter | Facebook | Tumblr | Instagram | PATREON |\nMockups represent pin concepts. Final products may vary.\nThere will be 12 pins total, one for each Birthstone Goddess, but to make this project more manageable, I am breaking the entire set of enamel pins down into 4 total campaigns, each one representing a season of the year.  This campaign features the 2nd set of pins, the GODDESSES OF AUTUMN, the Ladies of September, October, and November!\nBy pledging to this Kickstarter, you are locking in a special pricing of $13 per pin!  After this campaign, the pins will be listed at $15.\nDid you miss out on the first set of pins, the GODDESSES OF SUMMER?  Find them available for Pre-Order in my Etsy shop!\nHere's a video of how the GODDESSES OF SUMMER pins came out!\nPin Specs\nMATERIAL:  The GODDESSES OF AUTUMN pins will be HARD ENAMEL pins made with the cloisonn\u00e9 method, which produces a superb finish with resistance to scratches and damage.  They will be created with high polished gold plating and include metal clutches for the back.\nSandblasted Gold - Areas of the pins, such as the headpieces in September and October and the spots in November's lace trim, will be accented with a textured metallic gold.\nAn example of the sandblasted gold effect on the pins.\nSIZE:  These pins will be 2 inches (50mm) at their longest dimension.\n IMPORTANT NOTE!  Shipping will be charged outside of Kickstarter via my fulfillment management system (Backerkit) using the lowest rate available for shipments with USPS.  Tracking will be included in the cost of shipping, but insurance will not be included unless specifically requested, which you can do so via private message here on Kickstarter.\nThe cost of shipping is NOT included with your pledge and will be collected after the campaign via Backerkit!  Instructions will be sent via email after the campaign has been fully funded and completed.\nWhy is it so expensive to ship the book outside of the US?  Unfortunately, the coloring book is 9x12 inches, which makes its shipping container constitute as a large package, which drives up the cost of shipping.  I apologize for the inconvenience, but this is simply out of my control!\nIf you'd still like the coloring experience without the hassle of shipping, I have the book's entire collection of line art available as downloadable digital packs and single pages here.\nInternational Backers must be prepared to pay for customs fees, as I will not be providing refunds or exchanges for those who later refuse or abandon their packages based on being unable to pay the dues or any other reason that results in package refusal.  All international packages will be marked as 'merchandise' in accordance with shipping laws for commercial purchases.\nTo get a better look at the art of the prints, check out the Birthstone Goddesses gallery. \nNEW Original Art Tier Added!\nTo claim any art bundle, pick the appropriate Reward tier OR switch your current pledge to the appropriate tier.\nSTRETCH GOAL #1 - Shimmering Pearlescent Enamel - $3000\nIf we unlock this goal, we'll be able to add a special touch to the pins!  I'll add a shimmering pearlescent swirl texture to Lady of September's disc and Lady of October's veil and dress!  GOAL UNLOCKED!\nSTRETCH GOAL #2 - Goddesses of Autumn Sticker Set - $3200\nIf we unlock this goal, I'll add 4 inch vinyl stickers of the pin designs to all tiers with physical Rewards!  They will also be made available in the Add-On shop for those who want to pick up some.\nSTRETCH GOAL #3 - Little Gem Goddesses of Autumn Sticker Set - $3400\nIf we unlock this goal, I'll add 4 inch vinyl stickers of all three Little Gem Goddesses of Autumn to tiers with physical Rewards!  They will also be made available in the Add-On shop for those who want to pick up some.\n\nSTRETCH GOAL #4 - Metallic Upgrade for Stickers - $4000\nIf we unlock this goal, I'll add a metallic foil finish to the Goddesses of Autumn 4 inch vinyl stickers!\nYou will be able to add the following Add-Ons to your Kickstarter items via Backerkit after the campaign is over.  Miss your chance to get a pin or want to purchase extra gifts for a loved one? You can add these items to your Kickstarter items once the campaign ends and is successfully funded!\nSome of these items marked \"Kickstarter Add-On Shop Exclusive\" will be available ONLY for Kickstarter Backers after the campaign!  Instructions on how to purchase these Add-Ons will be sent via email after the campaign is successfully funded and completed.\nSee more art from the prints and products below at the Birthstone Goddesses shop.\nIf the sticker sets from the Stretch Goals are unlocked, they will be added to the Add-On shop as well.\nWith your help, we can make this collection a reality.  I can't wait to begin!\nIMPORTANT PROJECT DISCLAIMER!\nWhile I will do my very best to contact each and every one of you about your items via Kickstarter and via emails sent using Backerkit, if you have not paid your shipping and claimed your Kickstarter items (and any Add Ons) via Backerkit within 3 months after the surveys have been sent out (a fact I will announce here within Updates and via email), your items will be declared 'abandoned' and will be returned to my inventory.  No refunds or exchanges will be given after this point!\nPlease be sure to use an email for Kickstarter that you actively check and to check your Updates regularly, as I will not be held responsible for abandoned items!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe proofs for the pins have already been APPROVED and are prepped and ready to be manufactured as soon as I have the funds. Books are also already printed and in stock and ready to go. Other products, such as prints, can be easily printed based on the demands of this campaign.\n\nShipping estimated to begin between end of November and mid-December. I will do my best to get them out by the holidays, but I can make no promises! Backers will have a final chance to upgrade their shipping addresses before items are sent.\n\nAny delays will be communicated through Updates. I will provide an update at least once a month with a status on this project or when important milestones are reached and/or I need Backer responses.\n\nI have experience successfully delivering previous Kickstarters which involved enamel pins, coloring books, prints, and many other items and have a fulfillment management system in place to aid fulfillment in going smoothly.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Goddesses of Autumn Coloring Pack", "descp": "Thanks for your support!

Inexpensive, highly detailed gaming models that are easy and fun to paint and won't break when you actually use them for games!\nWhat are all the models and maps above?\nBelow are all of the models contained in the initial Core Set.\nAfter we reach our initial funding goal, we'll keep going and the contents of the initial Core Set will keep on growing. How large will the Core Set get you ask? Well that\u2019s top secret at Reaper but based on prior Kickstarters it\u2019s safe to say it should go past 140 miniatures~\nThe map tracks our progress. Each stop along the way unlocks more fun!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhat are the risks and challenges that come with completing your project, and how are you qualified to overcome them?\n\n!! VERY IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ !! \n\nPRODUCTION AND FULFILLMENT\n\nFor a project like ours, the risks and challenges fall into three categories:\n1) Overall Non-completion.\n2) Delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates.\n3) We do not produce a specific model or change/subtract or add a piece to a specific model.\n4) The bulk of our Kickstarter will be made in China. A tariff in excess of 50% or a ban on Chinese imports would seriously delay delivery and/or, in a worse case, shutdown this project entirely. If such an event occurs early on in this project, refunds (less charges and expense payments made) might be possible. If it occurs later in this project (after almost all expenses have been paid) there would be little and possibly no refunds. \n\nConcerning the risk of Overall Non-completion: we've already completed several massive Kickstarters and are fully aware of the pitfalls. Two things that could cause the non-completion of this Kickstarter are either the loss of our inbound shipments (due to an act of God, pirates or war), or a massive disaster (fire, flood) that levels our facility. Either of those events might be disastrous, however we carry full insurance on our facility and insure every shipment against loss or damage.\n\nObviously either of the above tragic events would create delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates, and that brings us to the second category: delays. We have learned a lot from our Kickstarters. However, delays are simply part of the cycle of business and it is our wisdom, training, and experience that helps us mitigate and work through any delay. Some delays, like ones we have control or exercise input over, are easy to solve. Other delays that are out of our control, such as US Customs and Border Protection and Consumer Product Safety Commission inspections and dock yard labor strikes are examples of delays out of our control. In the end we do everything possible to avoid any delay and will always update you as soon as possible.\n\nLastly there is the risk we will not produce a specific model shown. This will only occur if there is not enough interest in a specific model measured by the number of backers that actually pledge for to back it verses the cost to produce it. This event has never occurred in any of our previous Kickstarters, but is nonetheless still a risk. In the event this situation develops you will have plenty of time to adjust your Pledge Manager.\n\nAlso we reserve the right to modify any model or piece of a model shown to meet cost and production requirements. Modifications may include the removal or addition of new parts to a model. \n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nIf it is within 14 days of the closing of this Kickstarter we will refund your entire pledge amount. After 14 days, but before the closing of this Kickstarter\u2019s Reaper Pledge Manager, we will refund your entire pledge minus the 10% Kickstarter and Processing Fees we incur. Once the Reaper Pledge Manager closes, refund requests are subject to review and not all requests may be honored.\n\nYOUR BACKER RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS KICKSTARTER\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge in the Reaper Pledge Manager by August 31, 2020 you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after August 31, 2020.\n\nUnconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics. If you confirm your pledge late (after April 30, 2021) some items may not still be available. This means that part, if not all, of your rewards may not be available and/or your pledge may be forfeit.\n\nYou are responsible for all fees associated with the transit and acceptance by you to complete delivery. These include, but are not limited to: import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant and taxing authorities, VAT and GST due and delivery acceptance, brokerage and collection charges.\n\nYou are required to provide correct address information and ensure this address is deliverable by normal methods before your rewards are shipped.\n\nYou must have your address correct and up to date in the Reaper Pledge Manager when we announce shipping is beginning. You may change it at any time until then. There may be a shipping surcharge associated with changing countries.\n\nRewards returned to us as undeliverable will be shipped again postage prepaid by the Backer.\n\nALL OFFICIAL COMMUNICATIONS FOR THIS KICKSTARTER WILL BE VIA KICKSTARTER UPDATES ONLY.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Wave 2 - United Kingdom (NOT Europe)", "descp": "2019 Bones 5 PLEDGE LEVEL This reward level pledges enough to get you into this Bones 5 Kickstarter.

In addition, backers will get a brand new digital Art Book for Zombicide: Green Horde (including Black Plague content as well), accompanied by the digital versions of the Rising Sun and HATE Art Books. \nThe CMON Time Machine campaign is structured a bit differently than other campaigns. We're taking you to revisit past Kickstarters, Rising Sun, Zombicide: Green Horde, and HATE looking to fund brand new Soundtracks for them, as well as Digital Artbooks: The Kickstarter Exclusives from Rising Sun and HATE, and a brand new one for Zombicide: Green Horde and Black Plague.\nWith this also comes a new chance to pledge for those campaigns, acquiring these games along with many of their exclusives, as well access to a Time Vault (in the Pledge Manager) where many other leftover Exclusives from past campaigns (Arcadia Quest, The World of SMOG: Rise of Moloch, Zombicide: Black Plague, and Blood Rage, to name just a few) will be available.\nThere will be no Stretch Goals offered in this campaign and no new Optional Buys beyond the ones offered in the Pledge Manager system.\nThere will be a restriction of 1 pledge per backer.\nThe Time Vault is a Pledge Manager that gives you access to a plethora of Optional Buys from old campaigns, stored in our US warehouse.\nEach Optional Buy in the Pledge Manager system will be available in a specific limited quantity. Also, each backer will not be allowed to get more than 1 copies of very sought after items, or 5 of items that are easily available.\nBackers with $1 Time Vault pledge (with exception of those who have pledged to any of our previous Kickstarter campaigns) will gain access to the Pledge Manager only 48 hours after backers with a Rising Sun, Zombicide: Green Horde, or HATE Pledge (or any of the Bundles). So those backers will get first pick at the items in the Time Vault.\nThe Asia-Only Time Vault Pledge and Asia-Only HATE Pledge are separate from the other pledges. They give access to products in our Chinese warehouse, so these pledges will ship from China to Asian countries only.\nAsia-Only pledges give access to a different Time Vault, containing a smaller selection of items and in different quantities from the US Time Vault.\nNote that anything marked with this:\nis an exclusive item for Kickstarter (or other crowdfunding platforms) since its initial campaign, with any remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only.\nPlease Take Note!\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes, based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nFollowing is a list of rough estimates for shipping basic pledges. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address. Also keep in mind that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose.  \nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nPlease note that, aside from the Asia-only Pledges (Time Vault and HATE) which will be shipping from our Chinese hub to Asian countries, all products will be shipped from the USA. Non-US backers shipments will likely incur increased costs and possible customs fees. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is December 2019, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late there may not be enough quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. All \u201cNo Reward\u201d pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms please do not pledge on this project.\n\nTo make sure you have the best gaming experience, all CMON products are warrantied against manufacturing defects for 2 years from the of date purchase from CMON (proof of purchase required).

Most players will step into the shoes of LAPD Homicide detectives that will do whatever it takes to solve the case, but one player will take on the role of The Chisel whose goal is to stall and misdirect the detectives at every turn. \nNow, we are back with the newest expansion featuring brand new cases for the game Detective: Smoke and Mirrors. Smoke and Mirrors features some of the hardest cases created so far. These ain't for no gumshoes, ya hear? But don't worry, if you are new to Detective, you can get the game and all of the expansions right here in our ALL-IN Wise Head pledge level!\n The version of Detective: City of Angels you will get in this Kickstarter is VRG Select. This means that it will not be sold through normal distribution channels. We may offer it for sale on our website, at conventions, and to registered VRG Select Retailers that order directly from us.  If you are a retailer, see below on how to become a VRG Select Retailer!  \nSmoke and Mirrors will now come with FOUR cases with more than 240 cards! \nThese cases are some of the most challenging and complex we've ever designed. Not only will they test your mystery-solving skills to the utmost, each case features new mechanics, new types of cards, and new solve requirements. In the past, you only had to determine the guilty suspect, the murder weapon, and the motive. What happens when you ALSO have to identify each additional accomplice that was involved as well as where the next crime could take place?  \nAre you new to Detective? Well keep reading and we'll show you how it works!\nDetectives will explore every shadowy corner of the City of Angels, rendered in gorgeous and authentic detail on a large game board. The game board is based on an amazing public domain map created in 1932 by K. M. Leuschner, which Vincent has lovingly updated and adorned with his own touches.\nYou can download the rulebook by clicking the below button, or simply go to Rules School with The Gameboy Geek in the video below! \nWith the option to play competitively, cooperatively, or even solo, Detective: City of Angels will provide hours of mystery-solving gaming (see Game Modes section below).\nPlus, go all in for the Wise Head pledge level and get the Bullets Over Hollywood AND theSmoke and Mirrors expansions at a great price! You can even opt for Two Wave shipping to start enjoying Detective content THIS YEAR! (see the Shipping section below for details)\n\n\nWe encourage multiple copy pledges which can really help save on shipping. If you are interested in multiple copies you will be able to add them in the pledge manager. If you are interested in a group buy (4 or more copies), please contact the project creator using the Kickstarter messaging system for details.\n\nWe are thrilled to offer From Pen to Gun, an in-depth look at Vincent Dutrait's incredible art for Detective: City of Angels. Featuring a behind-the-scenes look at Dutrait's process and inspiration, as well chapters on the making-of-the-game from designer Evan Derrick, this beautiful, full-color art book is a must-have for fans of Detective as well as connoisseurs of boardgame art. \nSimply add $20 to your pledge to receive From Pen to Gun.\nWhile we highly recommend the game be played in CLASSIC MODE where everyone is playing competitively against each other AND The Chisel, the versatility of Detective: City of Angels is such that it can also be played in HEAD TO HEAD mode with one Detective player against The Chisel, or in SLEUTH MODE Cooperatively/Solitaire with no Chisel player.\nPlaying HEAD TO HEAD against the Chisel removes the \"corruption\" elements of multiple players bribing and snitching their way to victory, but there is still a battle of wits with the Chisel as you try to unravel the mystery.\nAlternatively, in SLEUTH MODE, you will use a paragraph book and case grid cards that allows the game to be played without a Chisel player. The Sleuth book will simulate the play of the Chisel. In particular, playing the game solo is a great way to prepare for your first game as The Chisel!\nIn each of these modes of play the ARC system is in the spotlight and the competitive elements of the game, like scratch and bribe actions, are removed. The focus is primarily on solving the case and immersing yourself in the role of a detective.\nWith so many cases included and multiple expansions, you'll be playing and enjoying Detective: City of Angels for a long time to come. But for those who want EVEN MORE, or those with a creative spark, you can use our Case Design Guide and Case Design Kit to design your very own cases! Or if you just want more cases, there are already some FAN MADE CASES that have been created using our official Case Design Kit!\nJoin us in our Facebook Community group to discuss the game, fan made cases, and more!\nFor a more immersive experience into the City of Angels, Van Ryder Games is pleased to present narration for all 13 of the case briefings in both Detective: City of Angels and Detective: Bullets over Hollywood. This was made possible by you, the Kickstarter backers, during our first campaign, and it's something we hope to do again for Detective: Smoke and Mirrors.\nCheck out the briefing for Blood on the Pier, narrated by the incomparable Cam Cornelius, to see what you can expect when you dive into the bleak streets of Los Angeles:\n Case Briefing Narration \nDetective: City of Angels is critically acclaimed! It is rated 8.1 on Boardgamegeek.com and has received the highest ratings from these prolific reviewers.\nMan Vs Meeple has awarded the game the Man Vs Meeple Approved status, a status given out to only a handful of games each year! \nSee why Zee Garcia rates the game a 9.5 and gave it the Dice Tower Seal of Excellence!\nDan King, aka The Gameboy Geek, awarded the game with his highest honor, the Sax Serenade Keeper!\n Things Get Dicey did an AMAZING video using the game as the topic. Starring the incredible Paula Deming, the video won't specifically tell you about how the game works, but it is HIGHLY entertaining! \nThere has been other content and reviews and we appreciate all the coverage. Much more can be easily found with internet searches, including unboxings, playthroughs, and more!\nShipping will be charged in our post-campaign pledge manager. Using the pledge manager, you will be able to confirm your rewards, confirm your address, and finalize your order.

We are paying close attention to Brexit and we plan to offer friendly shipping to the UK in any event, but please note that charges may differ depending on how the situation unfolds.\nIf you are in one of the following countries, you can take advantage of Two-Wave Shipping! Detective: City of Angels and Detective: Bullets Over Hollywood reprints will be ready THIS year and we plan to have the first wave of shipping for these items completed by the end of the year! Estimated delivery of the first wave is November/December 2019.\nCustomers with a delivery address in the following countries are eligible for Two-Wave shipping: USA, Canada, and countries in the European Union \nTwo wave shipping WILL be limited! It will be offered in the post campaign pledge manager, and will be first come, first served.\nWe have heard from MANY of you and we know there is a desire for this game in other languages. We have heard from so many of you wanting French, German, Spanish, Italian, and others. \nWe have been in negotiations with various different publishing partners to come to an agreement on foreign language versions, but as of this time have not officially secured any partners. Much of the feedback we have gotten is that it is \"too big\", \"too much to translate\", \"too expensive to produce\", \"too high of a retail price to be successful\" in that channel. And frankly we understand those concerns, many of which are why it is a VRG Select title for us! \nBut, we are not giving up on this possibility! We are in discussions about what a retail version might look like and if it can work for our partners. This would likely be a smaller version of the base game with 5 cases and some component and materials changes to bring the price down. \nPlease indicate your desire to see this game made in your language by voting HERE\nWe will update the below chart as the campaign goes on, here is how it looks just a few hours into the campaign.\n ***Final Update - over 1,470 responses!***", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nVan Ryder Games has successfully funded and fulfilled many projects. We learn more and more with each experience. Our goal is to get the game to you, our supporters, as quickly as possible, but we won't sacrifice quality for speed.\n\nThere are the usual risks of printing, shipping, customs, and other unintended delays, but you can be sure we will deliver the game to you as promised. Feel free to ask any of our returning backers! \n\nA few remarks we want to share with you regarding our approach for our projects, including this one. \n1. Communication is of the utmost importance to us. Please ask any and all questions and we will answer as quickly as possible. \n2. Our stretch goal items are determined by us before the campaign begins, in the event all of them are achieved we will not add more as it puts our project timeline and cost at risk. \n3. Your comments and feedback are REALLY important to us. If you have an idea, concern, or compliment, please share it with us! We can't promise to implement or act on every idea that comes our way, but we will certainly consider and listen to each one! \n4. We pledge to keep a positive attitude regardless of the success or failure of this project and we ask that you do the same. \n5. To have fun! Kickstarter projects can be stressful, but these are games and the most important thing is to have FUN!\n\nPlease note the following is our policy on pledges and refunds.\n\nRefund Policy\n\nAll pledges are final upon the completion of the funding period, however we may, at our sole discretion, refund your pledge in full if the request is made within two weeks of the end of the campaign. Any request for refund after more than two weeks has passed, if accepted by us, will be subject to a 10-20% cancellation fee to account for KS fees and administrative expenses. Please note that, anyone that does not complete the pledge manager by our required deadlines will not be eligible for a refund for any reason, including the assessment of additional shipping fees for expenses related to the delinquency of the backer completing their survey information.\n\nAbandoned Pledges\n\nWe require that our pledge manager and/or survey be completed in a timely manner so that we can process orders efficiently and on time. Completing your survey late at any point beyond the deadline we communicate AND/OR failure to pay shipping in a timely manner when the surveys are reopened, could result in significant delays in receiving your rewards, additional shipping expense, duties, taxes, or other fees to be paid by you, and you will not be eligible for a refund for any reason. We give plenty of time to complete the survey, so please do so in a timely manner to avoid any inconvenience or delay. Any survey that is not completed within 30 days from final fulfillment (defined as the last date of shipping of KS rewards for your region) will result in your pledge being considered abandoned and any amount pledged will be considered a gift in support of the project.\n\nBy pledging to this project you understand the risks, challenges, and pledge terms we have laid out here, and agree to be bound by them. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not pledge for this project and wait for the possibility of the game to become available direct or in the retail market.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "Sleuth", "descp": "The NEW Smoke and Mirrors expansion and all stretch goals\nAdd-ons require additional funds (see Add-ons section of page for items and price)\nShipping will be charged in our pledge manager at a later date (please see Shipping section of page for more details).\nINCLUDES:\nSmoke and Mirrors expansion", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,633 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 70 or more", "title": "Flatfoot", "descp": "The NEW Smoke and Mirrors expansion AND the Bullets Over Hollywood expansion.

The Chisel casebook came in at 32 pages, a full 8 pages per case (the base game's Chisel casebook, which contained 9 cases, was only 40 pages in comparison).

Every aspect of this lavish 54-card deck \u2014 from the design of the pips to the shading on the court cards \u2014has been meticulously crafted to create a wholly original and intricate Enigma overflowing with story, puzzles, and splendor.\nFan...and Flip!\nCarte Rouge showcases a venerable facade that, under inspection, reveals subtle nuances and variations. Throughout the deck there is a consistent color palette which each suit plays with in a slightly different fashion. The jokers extrapolate upon the shades of red and black inherent in traditional cards, standing out against the brighter jewel tones that make up the rest of the deck. Touches of metallic gold and silver adorn the inverse, faces, and aces, lending elegance and luxury.\nA Sampling of Cards from a Prototype Deck\nThe deck will arrive packed in a sideways style tuck-box and decorated in lavish gold foil (as can be seen on projects here and here, for reference). This tuck variety lends a more antiquated appearance, as well as being overall better suited to the aesthetic of the deck. We're still working out the final details on that design, but will certainly post images as soon as it comes together.  \nEarly Sketches of Tuck Design\nThe Most Recent Iteration of The Inverse\nHow Do You Play Carte Rouge? \nCarte Rouge is set in the real world and many of the puzzles will require you to research languages, history, science, geography, and other disciplines in order to solve them. No special knowledge is required whatsoever; however, you will want to have your wits, along with paper, a writing utensil, and an internet-connected device. These will prove invaluable as you research into various topics and threads you come across throughout the course of the game. \nWith well more than 24 distinct puzzles, Carte Rouge is recommended for 1-5 players (although larger groups are feasible) and has a total play time of 12-20 hours. \nCourt Cards from a Prototype Deck\nIf you'd like to get a taste of the style of puzzle you can expect in this (or any of our games) then check out our Facebook page. We post a new puzzle every Friday and often use these weekly puzzles to test out new styles and concepts we're playing with.  While the difficulty in Carte Rouge will be higher than our weekly puzzles, these will give you a good idea of the types and styles of challenges you can expect to encounter. \nA Beauteous Bridge Shuffle\nProduction and Timeline\nProduction: We will be printing with the Expert Playing Card Company (EPCC), which is part of the Conjuring Arts Research Center in New York City. They specialize in highly artistic decks of cards, with a focus on superb quality and exacting attention to detail. (To see some examples of their work, click here.) The Carte Rouge deck will include a variety of high-caliber design features including:\n Classic Finish card stock\n Pantone spot colors\n Pantone Metallics spot colors\n Sideways styled tuck box\n Hot foil detailing on the tuck box\n Internal printing on the tuck box\n And maybe more, stay tuned, there are still details being finalized!\nClick for a High-Resolution Version!\nTimeline: Unlike our previous games which we were able to produce concurrently with the Kickstarter campaign for a quick finish, Carte Rouge has a much larger scope that requires more time to complete. That said, even as we launch the campaign we are 99% prepared to send print-ready files off to EPCC to begin production. With a little extra time built in to account for TUBI (The Unforeseen But Inevitable) we are confident that we will be able to deliver on the following timeline:\n August 20-September 10: The campaign runs. And in the meantime, we finalize artwork, tuck box design and prepare files for EPCC. \n September 17: Kickstarter funds process. This takes a week as Kickstarter runs all the credit cards and takes their share. However, once this is finalized we will have a pretty good idea of our production needs.\n September 30: We place our order. There's a little TUBI time built in here, and we may well order early, but we've allowed two weeks specifically to deal with any issues that may arise with the files being sent to EPCC and giving us time to resolve them. \n October 1-21: Pledge Manager is open. Barring any unforeseen issues, we will be running our PM via Gamefound. (Note: All of our previous games will be available to add to your pledge in the PM to save on shipping.)\n  November - December : Production. With our order being placed at the end of September, about a month later we should have physical proofs in hand. Having run multiple test prints, we're feeling confident it should look quite lovely! Once we've approved the physical proofs, the final print run can begin.\n January 1, 2020: Product arrival. Getting over a thousand decks of cards shipped overseas takes some time and upon arrival there is customs processing. With all of that in consideration we anticipate receiving the cards around the turn of the year.\n  January 21, 2020: Fulfillment begins. Again, there's a bit of TUBI time here as well, but once we have the cards here in hand we can begin fulfillment! This should mean that everyone receives their rewards by sometime in February.\nAnd, as always, we reserve the right to do our best to get Carte Rouge shipped to you sooner than promised. We can't guarantee anything, but trust us, we're almost as excited to send you your decks as you are to receive them!\nSome Production Samples from EPCC\nShipping Info:\nLike our previous campaign, we intend to partner with Spiral Galaxy in the UK for our European fulfillment. That said, with the ever-looming specter of Brexit hanging over the entire industry, there is a possibility that they will no longer be an option for shipping by the time we reach fulfillment. If that occurs, we will be looking for a replacement but run the risk of delaying fulfillment to that part of the world or, alternately, fulfilling in a not-so-EU-friendly manner from our headquarters (i.e., living rooms) here in the United States. We'll be sure to keep you in the loop as that situation develops and we get closer to fulfillment.\nAssuming all goes according to plan, our shipping breaks down simply:\n United States: Free shipping.\n Rest of the World: $7 shipping for a single deck, $10 for two.\nWe sincerely wish we could offer free shipping to everyone, but unfortunately the logistics of international delivery simply don't allow for that, even for such a modestly-sized item. However, we want to do our best, so please know that even with these shipping charges we are subsidizing all international orders by at least 50% and often more depending on the destination. We always do our best to make it so you can get our games at a reasonable price, regardless of where you reside.\nAs always, additions to your order in Gamefound after the campaign ends will alter your shipping costs, but not by much. You can see a breakdown of some common order sizes below.\nSome Common Orders & Their Pricing\nReviews:\nA fantastic feature from Jack Eddy of The Cardboard Herald\n(He also did this interview with Khiara, the lead designer of Carte Rouge!)\nA stellar segment from Daniel Robison of Plumpy Thimble\nA lovely little tidbit from The Brawling Brothers\nA splendid special from Tom Heath of Slicker Drips\nStretch Goals..?\nSo, you may have noted that we haven't discussed stretch goals. The truth of the matter is, we don't have any this time around. From the get-go, we wanted Carte Rouge to be a luxurious artifact \u2014 something exceedingly satisfying to play with and display. Throughout the design process we repeatedly considered various aspects of the deck as stretch goals only to ultimately add them to the plans regardless. \nSimply Magical\nSince the deck has been designed with excellence in mind, we didn't want to make foil for the tuck or metallic finishing on the cards a separate goal--those and more are all part of the product regardless of whether we fund by 10 or 10,000 dollars over goal!\nJokers from a Prototype Deck\nWho is The Enigma Emporium?\nThe Enigma Emporium is just a couple of people with a love for board games, escape rooms, and puzzles of all sorts, along with a history of making them both for pleasure and profession. The Enigma Emporium was born of our desire to share that love and help make puzzling a stellar hobby for all involved!  \nKhiara & Logan - Summer 2019\nThe Enigma Emporium was the result of long conversations about puzzle games, subscription boxes, and our own likes and dislikes regarding what we'd played and, ultimately, what we would like to do differently.\nOur two primary goals are to provide as immersive and aesthetic an experience as possible and offer as low a financial barrier to entry as possible. Carte Rouge is a direct result of design with those goals in mind, and we hope that you'll enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed making it!\nThanks for looking!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith artwork 90% complete and the rest of the edits well underway, the biggest challenges remaining are production and fulfillment. We are prepared to begin the printing process with EPCC as soon as we have funds in hand. That process is estimated to take 2-3 months from start to finish, including shipping the cards here to us in the US so we can ship them out to you. With funds reaching us around early October, that means that production should be wrapping up around the end of this year. Once cards get to us, we'll get them sent out to you!\n\nThat said, there are talks of increased tariffs on a variety of imported goods, including playing cards. This has been accounted for in our funding goal, however that situation may end up adversely affecting customs processing times.\n\nThe other potential concern, particularly for our European backers, is the Brexit situation. \nOur EU friendly fulfillment partner (Spiral Galaxy) is based in the UK, therefore if Brexit passes that may mean a slight change to shipping occurrences.

Since Rose joined us full time in 2018 as a developer, we've been steaming ahead turning these ideas into a tightly woven narrative puzzle experience. \nRose has done an incredible job of tieing together a fantastic, dramatic narrative threaded through over 50 carefully engineered puzzles inspired by dozens of escape games, escape rooms and puzzle books, as well as an unreasonably large pile of reference books.\nRecruiting the help of Oxford University Egyptology researcher Dr Edward Love who inspired us with loads of historical examples of Egyptian codes, ciphers and language quirks, we've attempted to make not only a satisfying game, but an informative and accurate one too! A great big thank you to Johanna and Roland, too - without whom the game wouldn't anywhere near as beautiful as it is!\nA massive thank you to all of our early playtesters, who've helped us make this the best it can be. Thanks to: \nAmy Nash, Andy Mackay, Becky Todd, Bernard, Britt Callebaut, Brooke B., Daniel Pitcock, Dave Wetherall, Donald Stanley, Eric Mazelis, Erik Cole, Frans Treur, Grant Miner, Ian Stronach, James Olson, Jens Grimmel, Jeremy Skrdla, Jing Lim, Jolien Bortier, Justin Bird, Justine, Ken Whitehurst, Kevin Beeckmans-Cop, Linda Canton, Liz Howald, Loriana Giuliani, Nic, Peter 'Pedro' Goins, Sally, Simon Westenra, Stephen Spikings, Theo Edwards, Aidan Reynolds, Benedicte Wulff, Alex Hopkins, Jiaqi Li .", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGAME DESIGN: \nWe first came up with this idea over a year ago, and since then have been tirelessly researching both the thematic and structural aspects of the project. While between us, we've played dozens of puzzle games, gone through dozens of puzzle books, and completed half of London's escape rooms, we knew that for a game this ambitious, we needed something more. We recruited over 100 playtesters from around the world and got their feedback over multiple rounds of testing to ensure that the puzzles work exactly as we designed them to. Even after that, we need to make sure it all ticks like clockwork - and will be doing additional rounds of testing after the campaign before we get to print. The challenge for us is if there are lots of small edits to make, and ensuring that we get through those properly in good time. As Rose has done a spectacular job so far in this regard, we're confident that this will not affect the overall timeline projection. \n\nILLUSTRATION & GRAPHIC DESIGN \nAnyone who's backed our projects before knows that we spend a huge amount of time working on our artwork and graphic design. Johanna has completed the artwork for 90% of the puzzles, the journal and all other assets needed to wrap up the project for print. You can see many of her illustrations throughout the campaign. That said, there's a few more to be done and there may be tweaks needed in the final proofing stage. We've put a formal timeline in place to account for this, and have allowed several 'check points' to ensure that the artwork is up to scratch and consistent with the puzzle refinements we might make. All the packaging and box design is already complete and print-ready.\n\nMASS MANUFACTURE \nA year ago, as part of the Sub Terra Documentary promised from our \u00a3300,000 stretch goal, we visited the factory in Shanghai. We inspected all the pieces of equipment and production lines, met with staff and talked through our production objectives with their team, to ensure that we know exactly how your games are made. This means we've already avoided many of the costly mistakes that can catch projects off guard, and optimised the product design to take into account the way the machines and team produce the games - meaning they'll produce them better, faster! Nevertheless, we're working closely with the manufacturer for this project, Longpack, to ensure that every tiny detail is produced according to our high standards, and so that it delivers the excellent experience you expect. We'll be keeping close communication with them until we've confirmed everything is 100% and has been checked in the fulfillment warehouses.\nAs an additional assurance, we're spending two weeks with the Longpack team in Shanghai and around China inspecting the factory and their suppliers in November this year.\n\nFREIGHT & FULLFILMENT \nShipping hundreds or even thousands of games around the world is a complex project, and we've learned an enormous amount from our previous four successful campaigns. We've already calculated the plans for shipping games to 4 regional warehouses and fulfilling locally from there, as well as factoring in a realistic amount of contingency time for the not uncommon delays associated with sea freight of the games from the factory in China to the warehouses around the world. Additionally, we've optimised the product design of the game to account for shipping charge thresholds on dimensions and weight - ultimately saving you money.\n\nUNFORESEEN EVENTS \nDelivering a complex tabletop game Kickstarter project successfully is a challenge in itself, with a huge number of variables in play at any given time, and a large variety of places where things can go wrong. Due to the nature of this process, some things may change, but we are dedicated to making sure everyone is fully informed of any planned changes to content, the timeline or any other relevant information.

Develop your character from scratch using advanced deck-building, travel through the dream-world map and delve deeper into chosen locations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really blown away by my experience with this game so far (\u2026) It\u2019s an amazing well of creativity!\u201d \n  - Rahdo\n\u201cThis one is real puzzler, it\u2019s so vastly different that anything I have played (\u2026) Really excited about this one!\u201d\n  - Ant Lab Games\n\"Etherfields is as a surreal and meaningful journey into a dream world that begs to be discovered.\"\n - Man vs Meeple\n \u201cEtherfields is an immersive experience. The constant state of discovery and the unknown keeps you glued to the table. The game mechanisms are well integrated and just pull you deeper and deeper into this dream world. A dream world I don\u2019t want to leave!\u201d \n- Rolling solo\n\"Etherfields is a magical combination of mechanics, card driven story, and an experience that just draws you in and does not want to let go. \"\n- theMCGuiRE review  \n\"Creative use of components and fantastic art really delivers on the idea of adventures in the dream world; creating an immersive and evocative experience.\"\n - Ready Steady Play \n\u201eAll in all, Etherfields is really, really unique and very, very cool game. Its got intense narrative to it, it got amazing components and amazing artwork!\u201d \n- Crabbok\n\u201cFrom the beginning I liked this a little weird, mysterious, a bit twisted, abstract atmosphere that this game offers.\u201d \n\u2013 ON TABLE \nAmazing gameplay will be accompanied by one of the most striking miniatures and art we have ever made. Our experienced team put their entire artistic skill and hearts into this project, making sure the designs are extremely unique and successfully evoke the fleeting world of dreams. \nEtherfields will be packed with fresh and unique art. Your every skill, action, and even the smallest event will be illustrated with an outstanding craftsmanship. \nYour body has been taken. That's the only thing you know for sure. Your memory has faded away, as you drifted to this strange world of dark dreams. You are an empty vessel now. Looking around, you find masks lying around. Which one will you choose? What story will you follow?\nSomething is coming, and you can feel it \u2013 one dream, consuming all others, leaving a faint smell of poppy seeds. What does the Funeral Witch want of you?\nYour Heroes will be defined by their memory chests. These skills have some of the most surprising rules you ever witnessed in a Board Game \u2013 from literally escaping current reality to your \u201cdream room\u201d for a few turns, up to time modifying time or rewriting the reality. In dreams, no rules are unbreakable!\nThroughout the game, you will very often modify your chest with amazing new cards, but also with curses or filters.\n\nEvery interaction you will have in this strange world leaves a mark \u2013 and may lead to surprising results, as normal rules do not apply in Etherfields. You've managed to finally extinguish the ever-burning Lighthouse in Tideless Port?  This may help you find that key you have been looking for, but now Umbrageous will hunt you down through other dreams.\n\nDuring the game, fighting will never be your only option. Quite often it might actually be the worst option, as in dreams everyone you kill may come back, angrier and weirder. Instead, all characters may interact on two other levels \u2013 through cheating or utilizing their perception.\n Etherfields will test you in many different ways: secret rules that you can discover or deduce by looking closely on the map; drafting cards based on art or name only; guessing the intentions of entities you meet by considering what they do. \nBig, mind-melting concepts are the fuel of Etherfields, and we can't wait for you to discover them!  \n Click here for full version!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have currently successfully founded eight Kickstarter projects.

Represent your character's chosen class by picking up one of our collectible hard enamel pins today! Remember, you won't be charged until the campaign ends. So go ahead and select a reward that reflects the final amount of pins that you would like to purchase. You can always adjust your pledge at any point during the campaigns duration.\nWant to take a look at some of our previous projects? Follow the links below to shop or browse our social media!\nEtsy | Instagram | Portfolio\nNow let's talk about the designs! For Part 1 we are aiming to unlock six different classes: wizard, druid, bard, paladin, fighter, and ranger. Rewards will unlock two at a time starting with the wizard and druid designs. Here are some specs for the pins.\nhard enamel\ndouble backing posts with two rubber clutches\nDbl Feature logo imprint\nfixed to a backing card\ntwo color variants (or more if we can unlock them!)\navailable for both US and International backers\nNow that you've got some details out of the way, scroll down to see the 6 designs!\nIf you're on a budget or if you are looking to get some extra goodies, take a look at the available add-ons. Stickers will be handmade in our studio. We use a Canon Pixma Pro-100 printer to get high quality prints on Online Label's Waterproof Matte Vinyl Sticker Paper. The stickers are then cut using a Silhouette Cameo for a nice eve edge.\nThe add-on enamel pin designs have all been produced and are already on hand and in stock. These designs are from a previous Kickstarter, and we will be offering them at a discounted price through this Kickstarter to help us reach our goals! \nAnother add-on I am offering is upgraded backers in both metal locking and heart-shaped rubber designs. If you prefer to wear your pins out, I highly suggest you upgrade to locking backers. Two forms of force are required to release the lock, which secures your pins better than any other pin back. The heart lockers are more of an aesthetic upgrade, and are a cuter option to the rubber clasps that will come with the pins.\nLet's talk time. This kickstarter is structured so that we have a month to fund the pins, a month to produce the pins, and a few weeks to grade and ship the pins. Remember, you will not be charged until the last day of the campaign, and you can adjust your pledge at anytime! \nLuckily, the cost of creating this Kickstarter is pretty straightforward. We need help covering the cost of manufacturing, shipping from the manufacturer, printing of backing cards, shipping to y'all, and kickstarter fees. Your pledge can help us cover these costs, and you will receive a discounted pin for your help! After the Kickstarter ends, pins will be available on Etsy for $12, so your support early on really helps both of us!\nIf you haven't backed a Dbl Feature Kickstarter, seen us at a convention, or shopped with us online, then you might be wondering about the quality of our work.

Anyway!\nEach pin will be soft enamel and 38mm or 1.5 inches at the tallest point.

In this campaign, we are debuting two new expansion modules for the game to give new challenges to new and veteran players alike. One expansion module will contain three Quests and the other three Traps.  The new expansions will be exclusive to direct sales from Queen Games. In addition, many of our Escape products are out of print, so along with the new content we will be reprinting both the base box and the Big Box.\nNew dangers await! Do you dare take on the curse of the temple?\nIn addition to Escape products, we are offering a Kickstarter Special on two of our most popular products, the reprint of Escape Second Edition Big Box, and the recently reprinted Kingdom Builder Big Box.   \n\nEscape Base Game\nEscape: The Curse of the Temple is a real-time cooperative game in which all players must escape from a temple after awakening an ancient curse. The game plays in precisely 10 minutes, with an included soundtrack (also available digitally) counting down the game. Players must navigate through the temple by rolling dice and matching symbols to rooms, thereby gaining entry and visibility into adjacent rooms. The map of the temple will unfold as the players explore, making every game play different.  At certain points a countdown starts, and if players aren't back in the safe room when time is up, they will become \"lost\" and lose one of their dice.    \nNew Quests and Traps\nThis campaign will add three new Quest chambers and three new Trap chambers to the game.\nThe campaign includes new Quests and Traps that players must navigate, which adds to the tension of the game and forces players to work together even more. Quests require players to meet certain conditions in the room, whereas traps immediately capture a player and force them to work to Escape (or face the dire consequences). \n The development work on these new rooms is almost completed, but some details may change if the development team feels it creates a better experience. \n\nThe Riddle chamber (Quest)\nPlayers have to solve the riddle of the 4 statues! When the room is revealed, the four statues are placed face down in the four places in the wall. When players roll a set of symbols, they reveal the tile. Tiles must be revealed in the order indicated on the wall (blue, red, yellow, green). If a tile is revealed out of order, all statues are turned back over and players must start again.\nThe Quicksand chamber (Trap)\nWhen this trap is revealed, the player's adventurer is placed in the middle of the quicksand. They now only have a limited number of rolls to try and free themselves from impending doom. They can roll a maximum of 4 times and try to collect 4 torches to escape the quicksand. If they fail, they are stuck and cannot roll their dice again, until other players enter the chamber and roll the 4 torches to help them escape.\nExclusive Queenies 12 - 14\nThese Queenies were specially produced for BGG and Dice Tower three years ago in limited quantities. Here we want to give everybody the chance to also get their hands on them. \nQueenie 12: Slide\nThis Queenie comes with two chambers and a curse. The slide chamber is a tricky one, because you can enter it for free from the staircase side. But if you want to enter the chamber from the other side, you have to roll 3 torches. So better be sure before using the slide to often.\nThe debris chamber is interesting since in order to discover this chamber a player not only has to roll two adventurer icons but in addition also a key and a torch.\nAnd finally the Cyclops curse makes you cover one of your eyes with your hand and leave it there until the curse is lifted. Sounds easy, but rolling with one hand and moving your adventurer with the limited vision is very tricky!\nQueenie 13: Map\nThe map chamber is a great destination for players since it is one of the few chambers that actually help the players and make the escape a little bit easier. Inside the chamber a player can roll 2 torch icons and then place their adventurer in any chamber that they want, allowing the player to quickly navigate the temple and help other players. \nQueenie 14: Wishing Well\nThis chamber also helps the players succeed. If you roll 2 key icons, you may either draw a treasure, get rid of a curse, or regain one of your lost dice! And you can use the wishing well multiple times... But only one wish at a time, so you have to leave the chamber and reenter if you want to use it more than once.\nBig Box 2nd Edition\nAll pledges with the Big Box will include the new expansions as well as Queenies 12-14. All of these will fit into the Big Box (although they will not all fit in the insert).\nMore content means more challenges to overcome. The Big Box includes the Base Game, 8 Expansion modules (originally released as three expansion boxes) and 10 Queenies (single expansion modules):\nModule 1: Curses\nModule 2: Treasures\nModule 3: Illusion chambers \nModule 4: Special chambers \nModule 5: Quest chambers\nModule 6: Characters\nModule 7: Trap chambers\nModule 8: Time chambers \nTen (10) Queenies. See the graphic for the names of each\nThe All In pledge for the give you everything ever made for Escape. \nReviews of Escape\nLanguages\nEscape is fully language independent. Rulebooks will come in the following languages, with more available as pdfs on our website:\nBase Game: English, German, Dutch, French, Spanish\nBig Box: German and English\nQueenies and New Expansions: English, German, French\n\nWhy Back the Kickstarter (And Post-Kickstarter Availability) \nBacking the Kickstarter guarantees you get the product earliest and at the best price. We do not use a pledge manager, but a late pledge will be available via our webstore.\nOur plans for these products post-campaign:\nThe new expansions will be sold direct from Queen Games or at conventions, and there are no settled plans for distribution.\nOur Big Boxes are premium products, and often do not enter distribution in many markets, including North America. \n The base game will be for sale through retailers in Europe and North America. \nSome products on our Kickstarters will be available for a limited time (and an increased cost) on our webstore (www.queengames.shop).\nProduction and Delivery\nThe production of the Escape games is planned for August/September 2019. As soon as it is produced, we plan to ship the pledges out to backers shortly after. We print our games at factories in Europe, so there are no long boat rides involved. All dates in this campaign are our best estimates, but are subject to change. \nQueen Games is not responsible for any local charges, customs and/or lost packages due to local postal service. We will not reimburse you if that is the case. Sending a pledge a second time, if the first package did not make it due to one of the above mentioned reasons, can only be offered if the backer covers the shipping cost in full.\nPlease make sure, that the address you are using and any notes down in the survey, following this campaign is up to date, and written in English.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nQueen Games is a company with over 25 years of experience to it's name.\n\nWe know about the Kickstarter challenges, such as coordination of production from multiple manufacturers, delays with production and shipping, challenges with shipping around the world and missing or lost packages.\n\nAlso, despite sending the rewards at the same time, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others because of logistics of international shipping.\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the name, final look and materials of the project and hence the rewards, are subject to change and may differ from what is presented while the Kickstarter campaign was active.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Escape: New Quests & Traps", "descp": "You will receive a copy of:\nEscape Queenie: New Quests -

Do you have the mental fortitude necessary to conquer all 25+ puzzles and unlock the entire story?  \nWhat Is It?\nPuzzleTales.com will be a website where you can read an interesting short story.  Between chapters of the story, there will be puzzles to solve which will unlock the next chapter.  Our first tale, Svalbard,  tells the story of Mai as she explores a utopian post-apocalyptic world and discovers ancient time vaults, forgotten robot enclaves and slumbering super computers. You will help her scavenge for old technology in the ruined cities and discover ancient secrets about previous civilizations.  There are multiple paths through this non-linear story, and many secrets to discover as you play along. \nFlowchart showing a possible layout of the story (yellow) and puzzles (green).\nEach chapter will have one or more puzzles that thematically ties into the story.  You will find word puzzles like crossword puzzles, cryptograms and anagrams.  There will be logic puzzles like sudoku, slitherlink and battleship. Discover math puzzles like kakuro, magic squares and crypto-math.  You may also encounter coloring puzzles, mazes or connect the dots.  Every puzzle is unique and there will be a wide variety of challenges to keep you entertained. \nThe puzzles are designed to be moderately challenging: not too easy and not too hard.  We are aiming for around 30-60mins of solving time for each puzzle. If you get stuck, there will be a built in no-penalty hint system to get you past the roadblock.  We want people to get to the end and reach the conclusion of the story, so we'll help if you can't solve a puzzle.\nStretch Goals\nWe did it!  We reached our funding goal. Thanks everyone! \nBut let's not stop there.  Given the chance, there are many ways that we can continue to enhance the project for everyone.  So here are some stretch goals that we can strive towards. Please help us spread the word.\n$500 - UNLOCKED - Illustrations for each chapter and an interactive map.\n$750 - UNLOCKED - Dedicated high score page for Backers only and each Backer's name listed in the credits on our website.\n$1000 - UNLOCKED - Five extra secret easter-egg puzzles will be created and hidden throughout the experience.\n$1500 - UNLOCKED - We will create a beautiful illustration for the story and give all backers a high quality download link so you can print a small poster or use it as digital wallpaper.\n$2000 - LOCKED - We'll make at least one of the puzzles interactive with animations and sounds. It's a mini-game!\n\nWhy Are We Qualified \nJake Olefsky is the founder of Braingle.com, which contains the world's largest collection of brain teasers, riddles and puzzles. In addition to creating numerous successful websites, he has spent decades creating and solving puzzles of all kinds.  Jake is the driving force behind this project and will be creating the puzzles, the website and coordinating the project.\nJake has done this before. His first puzzle tale was completed last year and has been very popular.  The Hypatia is a mystery told on a spaceship with more than 25 puzzles to solve. You can play it right now, but be warned, the puzzles are quite challenging :) More challenging than the puzzles will be for this new experience.\nFor PuzzleTales, we are upping the quality of the story, making a dedicated website, and making better puzzles with great artwork.\nLavie Tidhar is the World Fantasy Award winning author of Osama (2011), the Jerwood Fiction Uncovered Prize winner for A Man Lies Dreaming (2014), and the Campbell Award winner for Central Station (2016), in addition to many other works and several other awards. You can read one of his short stories, \"Yiwu\", at Tor.com or listen to LeVar Burton read it.\n\nWhat Is Already Done\n1) The Short Story has already been written.  Lavie Tidhar has delivered a wonderful 13,500 word sci-fi tale that you will enjoy reading.\n2) The Puzzles are about half way completed and being finished at a rate of 1-2 per week.\n3) The Website is mostly built.  You can visit it now to learn more about the project.  The part of the website that lets you read the story, get hints and solve the puzzles is nearly finished and is going through beta testing right now. \n\nWhat We Need\nWe need to hire an artist to do some illustrations for each chapter of the story and to create unique artwork for some of the puzzles. \n1) We would like to have a small drawing for each chapter that illustrates what happens in that part of the story.  Some of these drawings will have small puzzles hidden inside of them. We were inspired by Middle Age and Renaissance manuscripts which sometimes had \"Historiated Initials\" at the start of important chapters.  These are enlarged letters that depict a scene from the text (example below).  We would love to do something like this for the chapters in our story.\n2) We would also like to have a beautiful, hand drawn map that shows the locations that you visit throughout the story.  The map will be interactive, with places appearing as you discover them, and it will function on the website as a way to navigate.  If you want to jump to a different branch of the non-linear story, you can bring up the map and pick your destination.\n3) Some of the puzzles require specialized images to be created.  With your support, we can make sure that the artwork is top-quality.\n4) If this fundraising campaign exceeds our goal, we will be able to enhance the product in additional ways.  Maybe with extra illustrations, extra puzzles, enhanced website features or other perks.  Stay tuned for more details if it looks like this is possible...\n\nHow You Can Help\n1) Become a backer of this project!

This is a digital product, so all rewards will be delivered on our website.  Some of the puzzles may be interactive puzzle games, but most of the puzzles will be available as a PDF, so you can download, print and solve them offline.\nFor those competitive backers who choose the \"Head Start\" option, you will get access to everything 2 weeks before everyone else.  Finish before your friends even start!\nOur goal is to have the first tale finished and published by July of this year.

The story is already written and edited. There are no roadblocks to finishing the puzzles. The website is mostly complete and ready for action.

Our puzzle novel The Maze of Games has been no exception. Years after we ran two fantastic Maze campaigns on Kickstarter, we're still finding new pathways and puzzles within the Gatekeeper's domain. We wanted to take everything we have for The Maze of Games and put it into one massive omnibus package, supplementing it with fun new material. But to do that we had to send author Mike Selinker and developer Gaby Weidling into their own maze. As you may have guessed from the video above, things went a bit awry. The two are now stuck in the maze.\nOn the upside, before the Gatekeeper trapped Mike and Gaby, they were able to gather quite a bit of stuff. For the first time, you can get everything for The Maze of Games in one place, including a bunch of new items for fans who thought they had it all. Fresh off the book being solved for the first time, we're Kickstarting a new answer guide handwritten by characters Colleen and Samuel Quaice entitled The Keymaster's Tome. There's The Gatekeeper's Variety Hour audio puzzle suite and a new audiobook for The Theseus Guide to the Final Maze. If we're very clever and very lucky, we can help Mike and Gaby escape the room and add a few more goodies to our cache. \nAll the digital and physical rewards. Well, most of them, anyway.\nAlong with the puzzle creations we've lined up for you, we have a unique adventure. The Maze of Games Escape Room by Epic Team Adventures opens its doors today, March 14th. You can book your experience today at epicteamadventures.com! Designed by Gaby, Mike, and ETA's Jesse McGatha and Richard Thames Rowan, this intense experience is the first of several mind-bending puzzle rooms set in the Gatekeeper's world. When you book, you can use the escape room discount code we've added to every backer level so you can experience what Mike and Gaby are going through. Hopefully you'll have an easier time getting through the maze than they are.\nBelow you'll find all the details on The Maze of Games Omnibus and Escape Room Experience, including descriptions of all the items, backer levels, stretch goals, and the Maze of Games Escape Room. And what would a Maze of Games Kickstarter be without puzzles? Make sure to come back as we update. Mike and Gaby will send us messages from inside the room, and we'll need your help to decipher them. See below for details, and keep an eye on @LoneSharkGames on Twitter for all the puzzling info. Mike and Gaby have assured us there are secret badges along the way for everyone who can help them escape the maze. \nThe Maze of Games hardback, The Theseus Guide to the Final Maze, and the Maze Map.\nThe Maze of Games is a puzzle novel Mike had trapped in his head for 18 years prior to 2013, when we took the unique book to Kickstarter. It's the story of two British children from 1897, Colleen and Samuel Quaice, who get trapped in a series of increasingly deadly mazes by a skeletal guardian called the Gatekeeper. What makes the book unique\u2014other than its strange story and dynamic art by Magic: The Gathering artist Pete Venters\u2014is that the pages are in the wrong order. You must solve the puzzles and restore the narrative in order to help the children escape the maze. A 40-page section called the Conundrucopia features all of the best modern-day puzzlemakers writing puzzles in the style of the 1890s. It's cool. \nThe Two of Diamonds spread in The Maze of Games.\nIf you pledge to this Kickstarter campaign, you can get access to:\nThe hardback of The Maze of Games, its PDF, and its audiobook narrated by Wil Wheaton.\nThe softcover of The Theseus Guide to Guide to the Final Maze and its PDF.\nThe recently updated second edition of the Maze Map poster and PDF, a unique 20\"x30\" story maze by Mike, Eric Harshbarger, and Corey Macourek.\nAudio albums of The Maze of Games Soundtrack by composer Austin Wintory and the Songs in the Key of Maze EP by Marian Call, Kirby Krackle, and Paul & Storm.\nA discount code for the solvable ebook for iPhone and iPad by Puzzazz. \nThe covers for the Maze of Games Audiobook, Songs in the Key of Maze, and the Maze of Games Soundtrack. Art by Pete Venters, graphic design by Elisa Teague.\nEach backer who receives physical goods will pay the actual cost of shipping their rewards. Final shipping rates and costs will be loaded into our PledgeManager, and you will pay for your shipping via the PledgeManager as well.  We'll charge backers as close to our actual shipping costs for their shipping address as we can for each order. Lone Shark is not making any profit on shipping and handling. FYI: The Maze of Games hardback is a heavy book. See the FAQ for our current shipping estimates.\nPlus there's a lot of brand new stuff you've never seen. Including this amazing project. \nPLAY\n\nFor years, we've imagined a live experience where you get thrown into the Gatekeeper's maze and have to solve your way out. We knew of only one team who could bring this vision to life: downtown Seattle's Epic Team Adventures. Our friends at ETA have made some of our favorite rooms: the film noir-themed The Sparrow Files, the Poe-inspired The Raven and the Red Death, and many more. ETA's team includes some of the Maze's biggest fans, and so we collaborated with them to make The Maze of Games Escape Rooms.\nSome of the sights in the Maze of Games escape room. This image is spoiler-free and not used in any puzzles in this campaign.\nFar from being satisfied with making  one Maze of Games escape room, ETA concocted an adventurous plan to make four rooms in the same space, all themed around authors trapped in the maze. Gaby and Mike worked with ETA designers Rich Rowan and Jesse McGatha to craft these escape rooms, and we got our Gatekeeper Wil Wheaton to narrate the whole thing. It's a tremendously cool experience that you can see in the video above.\nWe hope that you can all make it to Seattle and match wits with the Gatekeeper. To encourage you to visit us, all reward levels of this Kickstarter campaign include a discount code good for $35 off the cost of a full room booking of The Maze of Games Escape Room at Epic Team Adventures. If you pledge, click this link to get access to the code, allowing you to book your room experience on the ETA site today. The code can be used any time in the next year. Remember: Pledge, get the code, book the room.\nFor those who just want to buy it all now, look at the level called Everything Maze Plus A Full Room, which lets you pledge for an entire room plus all the physical and digital rewards. We can't send out individual codes until after the campaign closes, so if you're in a hurry to book, get your $35 code here today and then pay the rest on the ETA site.\nThe Keymaster's Tome mockup cover (not final art). Designed by Skylar Woodies with handwriting by Gaby and Mike.\nThe Keymaster\u2019s Tome is a new physical book made for this Kickstarter, available in both printed and PDF form. People have been asking us since the dawn of this project when we were going to have a Keymaster to go with our Gatekeeper. The Theseus Guide to the Final Maze was the closest we could get to an answer booklet without divulging the Maze's secrets to everyone, and it was fun to add more puzzles too. But just this past month, a group of puzzle solvers finished the final puzzle in The Maze of Games. With that done, we felt that the time was right for an answer book, so Mike and Gaby hand-crafted The Keymaster's Tome, a version of The Maze of Games puzzles (not the story) with answers, conversations, and tidbits hand-written in the margins by the Quaice siblings as they make their way through the maze. Here's as much of a look as we can show you. \nPage spread from The Keymaster's Tome. Spoiler hands not included.\nThe book is available as a PDF in the Just The New Digitals level, as well as a softcover in the Just The New Book & The New Digitals level. \nStretch Goals\nWhen we started the campaign, The Keymaster's Tome was 60 pages detailing answers for the main puzzle section of The Maze of Games. Now that the campaign has exceeded our funding goal, we're adding hand-written and annotated answers to more puzzles.\nUNLOCKED: $13,500 - We added 24 pages of Conundrucopia answers in our hand-written, story-based style. That raised the Tome from 60 pages to 84 pages. \nUNLOCKED: $15,000 -  We added 8 pages of extras: the endpapers, the library card, the credits, and so on. Everyone who pledges to this campaign will have their name in The Keymaster\u2019s Tome. This got the Tome from 84 pages to 92 pages. \nUNLOCKED: $17,500 - We added 8 pages of The Theseus Guide to the Final Maze answers. This got the Tome from 92 pages to 100 pages. \nUNLOCKED: $20,000 - We added 8 pages of soundtrack and Maze Map answers. This got the Tome from 100 to 108 pages.\nUNLOCKED: $25,000 - We added an audio answer key to The Gatekeeper's Variety Hour, recorded by Mike and Gaby! \nUNLOCKED: $30,000 - We've begun the creation of a new Maze of Games website with The Keymaster's Tome content for backers to access!\nUNLOCKED: $35,000 - We're including cool Maze of Games wallpaper (in black and white and color) in every digital bundle!\nUPCOMING GOAL: $40,000 - We'll include the Maze of Games escape room 2-page spread from Puzzlecraft in every digital bundle and add the handwritten answers to The Keymaster's Tome!\nCovers for The Theseus Guide to the Final Maze audiobook and The Gatekeeper's Variety Hour. Art and graphics by Pete Venters and Elisa Teague.\nWe\u2019re introducing two new audio products as part of this campaign. First,The Theseus Guide to the Final Maze now has its own audiobook, which adds a new chapter to the existing one for The Maze of Games. Both star Wil Wheaton doing all the voices.\nThe second audio project is The Gatekeeper's Variety Hour (originally named The Audiophonic Conundrucopia), a radio show hosted by Wil alongside us and our puzzlemaker and musician friends Kid Beyond, Molly Lewis, Austin Wintory, Francis Heaney, Eric Chaikin, Greg Pliska, and Wil Zambole. It's easy to turn it on. You must solve the puzzles to turn it off.  \nMike and Molly Lewis record something old-timey for the Variety Hour. Photo by Gaby.\nBoth of these new audio experiences supplement The Maze of Games audiobook, created by Skyboat Media. If you've only got the physical books, open up your ears for a whole new way to play. \nThe Gatekeeper's Edition. Created by Elisa Teague and Regent Publishing, ambigram by Scott Kim.\nOK, we swear this story is true. When we first made The Maze of Games, we made 250 copies of a black and silver leatherette-bound in-world book called The Gatekeeper's Edition. It has deckled pages, a library card, a ribbon, and other boss features. We fulfilled all of those and agreed never to make that edition again. Done and done.\nBut ... our guy Shane was cleaning up the warehouse in preparation for a move last month and literally tripped over a box of Gatekeeper's Editions. We assume we kept them in case some didn't reach their destinations, and everyone forgot about them. Now that we found this treasure trove, we couldn't just keep it locked up. So we're making a mere ten absolutely, positively, very last ever copies of The Maze of Games Gatekeeper's Edition available at the Keymaster's Trove level, along with a signed copy of the Keymaster's Tome. If you're interested in owning a piece of history, take a look at that level. \nMike Selinker is the president of the Seattle design studio Lone Shark Games. He's the co-designer of the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, Lords of Vegas, Unspeakable Words, Apocrypha, The Ninth World, Thornwatch, and many other games, as well as the author of other books like Puzzlecraft, The Kobold Guide to Board Game Design, and Game Theory in the Age of Chaos. While at Wizards, he helped design and develop games like Betrayal at House on the Hill, Risk Godstorm, and Axis & Allies, and was a creative director on 3rd edition Dungeons & Dragons. He\u2019s also the executive director of the political advocacy group Basket of Adorables. He can be found at @mikeselinker. \nPete Venters is the book's illustrator, and one of the most popular game artists around. He is best known for his nearly 300 pieces of trading card art for Magic: The Gathering, but has also worked in concept art, comic books, and book design. He is the illustrator for the Gothic Charm School trade paperback, written by his wife, Jillian Venters. He and Mike have collaborated on projects for Disney and Wizards of the Coast.\nElisa Teague is the book's graphic designer. She is a game and puzzle designer, her latest titles including Geek Out!, Betrayal at House on the Hill: Widow's Walk, Lions and Tigers and Bears - Oh My, various Dungeons & Dragons and other RPG modules, and the upcoming Kingdom Hearts Talisman. She has also been an art director, developer, and production manager on over 100 titles in the industry, including Lone Shark Games' monster hit (pun intended) Apocrypha Adventure Card Game.\nGaby Weidling is the book's developer. She's a game, puzzle, and event designer whose  handiwork can be found in games like the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, Betrayal at House on the Hill: Widow\u2019s Walk, Apocrypha, and more. Some of her favorite puzzle projects include developing The Maze of Games and Puzzlecraft, designing a series of escape rooms set in the world of Magic: the Gathering\u2019s Innistrad, and teaching puzzle design at DigiPen. She spends her spare time trying new things, cuddling her cats, and just generally being a sunshine cannon. Someday she\u2019ll quit the game industry to become a detective or reboot Matlock. Maybe both. She can be found at @ermahgerdgerby.\nTanis O'Connor is the book's editor. Her past work includes design, development, and editing on Dungeons & Dragons with Wizards of the Coast, the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game at Paizo Publishing, many other game and puzzle events, and 5 (!) MIT Mystery Hunts. Do not try this at home. \nOh, right, we nearly forgot. Gaby and Mike are trapped in the Maze of Games escape room for the entire length of this campaign. We'd go and let them out, but it's more fun to let you figure out how to free them. We're going to give you daily puzzles of several types, all of which combine to figure out how to get them out. It'll all end in a final campaign-end livestream, but before we get there, you better get cracking on these puzzles. \nHere's what you got:\nIn the campaign video above and six later update videos are seven rebus puzzles. Those are visual addition puzzles like the kind you see on the show Concentration. Each leads to an answer, which will get you one of seven badges. The first one contains this image. Another hidden puzzle across all the videos will get you the eighth badge.\nIf you follow our Twitter account @lonesharkgames, you'll see a set of 20 daily Tom Swifties. Those are puzzles where Tom says a sentence in a particularly punny manner such as \"'I'd like to stop by the mausoleum,' Tom said cryptically.\" In our Gatekeeper Swifties, the answers are all names of authors the Gatekeeper has trapped in the Maze. Answering all of them will lead to a final instruction which gives you a ninth badge. The first ten such puzzles are gathered here.\nAt five geek-themed events\u2014the MIT Mystery Hunt, the JoCo Cruise, Emerald City Comic Con, the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament, and this week's PAX East\u2014we'll be there giving out postcards. All five puzzles' answers combine together in a specific way to get you a tenth badge. \nThe first event postcard. We'll post the rest after each event ends.\nFinally, getting Mike and Gaby out of the Maze of Games escape room will get you the eleventh badge. That's only available when the campaign comes to an end.\nWhen you have an answer for any of these puzzles, submit it on our answer site. You'll get a response from us that will let you continue your quest and maybe give you a badge. When you get one, use it as your Kickstarter, Facebook, or Twitter icon. That'll show off how smart a puzzler you are, and maybe even that you care if Mike and Gaby get out alive. Regardless, we'll see you in the Maze. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe don't have a lot of risks on this campaign. The Maze of Games Escape Room is ready for opening, the audiobooks are recorded and formatted for download, and the third-printing books are getting ready for shipment. All the digital rewards and most of the physical rewards are ready to go.\n\nThe only physical object that isn't finished is The Keymaster's Tome, because we hope the campaign lets us make a larger version of it.

I was losing a piece of myself. The closer he moved toward me the more frightened I became. His hands, those strong but gentle hands of a father, had transformed into something maniacal. Wrapped in a paper towel, his index finger and thumb pinched together like the claw of a crab closing in on its prey. I tried to scurry away but I was pinned against the wall. \nAs my father moved closer I felt a new wave of tears building. I knew it was going to be the most excruciating thing I had ever experienced. There was nowhere to go and nothing left to do but scream.\n\u201cNo, stop!\u201d I cried.\nHe paused just long enough for my mother to sweep in and offer a way out. \n\u201cWell I can do it,\u201d she said in a nice, calm, soothing voice.\nI had a choice - the pinching claws of death or my mother\u2019s gentle hands.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, steeling my nerves. \u201cMommy can do it!\u201d\nWith a sob, I opened my mouth and felt her fingers wrap around my tooth. I winced and clenched my fists, \u201cBut will it hurt?\u201d I cried out. \nIn an instant, it was over. My mother triumphantly held the tooth for me to see as my tongue surveyed the hole in my gums. \n\u201cIt\u2019s gone? But it didn\u2019t even hurt,\u201d I said still trying to contain my sobs.\nDisappointed, my father\u2019s hands retreated. I took a deep breath. It was going to be okay. \nOn a calm night in 1894, in beautiful ______ _____, an eight year old boy, young ____ _______ faced a similar dread. To help him cope with the traumatic experience, a famous writer, ____ ______, was commissioned to compose a story. Seizing the opportunity to influence and comfort his King, he penned a story about a young boy who lost a tooth and went on a grand adventure. \nThe tooth, safely tucked away under his pillow, the young boy anxiously awaited the arrival of _________ _____ , who would come and replace the tooth with a gold coin. The _____ left his comfortable home, an empty ______ box, to brave the busy streets and smelly sewers. He climbed through the _____ to reach the child\u2019s room. Instead of leaving behind the golden coin, he used a magical power to shrink the boy down to the size of a _____ and they took to the streets. \nWho was the boy in the story?\nWho came to take him on an adventure?\nWhat did he learn?\nAnswer these questions and more by downloading this puzzle pack. The puzzles will provide clues to the missing words so that you can finish the story.\n Welcome to Myths and Legends - your journey has begun. \nSo what do you think? The story above is what we like to call a puzzle story!\nLet's face it. When you picture a puzzle book, it's easy to imagine it sitting on the nightstand next to Grandma's chair. But we all know that puzzles stimulate the brain, improve memory, and lower stress. Who doesn't want that!? I don\u2019t know about you but I\u2019m always stressing. \nSo why does Grandma get all the benefits while the rest of us suffer? (No offense Grandma, we love you!)\nWell, that\u2019s why we\u2019re here. My dad and I are on a mission to spice things up. Myths and Legends Volume 1 is like coke and mentos. It\u2019s puzzles and stories but when you put them together magic happens (but with less mess). \nIf the idea of doing something really cool appeals to you, then you're going to love Myths and Legends!\nIn Myths and Legends there are 14 hand-picked stories from around the world. We poked a bunch of holes in the stories and it is up to you to patch them up. Each puzzle is a clue to a missing word in the story. All you have to do is solve the puzzles, find the clues, and finish the story. (Don\u2019t you like how we worked the tag line in there? I\u2019m pretty proud of it!)\nIt\u2019s really simple. The book has two stages. In the first stage you solve the puzzle stories. In the second stage you find secret clues to solve the final mystery - the weird symbols on the cover of the book. \nWhat kind of puzzles can you expect? \nWord Search\nSudoku\nWord Maze\nCodebreaker\nFramework\nCrossword\nCryptogram\nAfter the puzzles comes my favorite part - ciphers! We are using three types of ciphers in this book:\nShift Right\nPolybius Square\nFreemason \nNow don\u2019t let any of this scare you. A year ago I wasn\u2019t sure I could do ciphers either. But you know what, they\u2019re pretty fun. (Boy I wish I knew how to use ciphers back in middle school). They look harder than they really are but you don\u2019t have to worry about that. Our book comes with an amazing website that we call The Vault (cue the rent-a-choir singing a dramatic AAHH). \nIn The Vault I will teach you how to solve the puzzles and ciphers. Not only that but I will also give you hints and clues to help you on your journey. There are QR codes and links in the book that will take you directly to the page you need on our website. \nThere\u2019s no app or anything to download. Just a website that you can access with any device (I, of course, prefer my phone hence the phone in the photos). \nOh, and did I mention The Vault is FREE! That\u2019s right, just register for the website and it\u2019s all yours. \nIt's alright. We know this sounds pretty cool. If you want to take a break and pledge now, go ahead. We'll wait for you. \nNow you might be wondering how we came up with this. Well... this ain't our first rodeo. \nIn late August of 2018 I had just recently turned 18 and graduated high school. I really wanted to spend some time doing what I love - writing and learning how to run a business. After many conversations with my dad we finally settled on an idea and brought it to Kickstarter: (click the link below to check it out)\n Initiation: An Interactive Puzzle Book \nLet me tell you about that campaign. An awesome community of 215 backers took the idea from nothing to shipping books all over the world! I learned all about crowd funding and met some wonderful people. \nSome of the backers from that project gave me great feedback. For example, I learned that some of the puzzles were very difficult (go figure), a few of the clues were kind of ambiguous (yeah I could see that), and we made some mistakes (sorry about that). The book has since been updated and is doing well on Amazon.com. But I always planned on Initiation being the beginning. \nMyths and Legends is so much more. The concept is the same, but in this one, I am really focused on storytelling. Here are some other important changes to this book based on the feedback from Initiation:\nRather than being organized in blocks, the puzzles are organized into activities and each activity will have a variety of puzzles. \nWe are focused on the puzzles that are best for a wide audience. We learned that drop quotes, for example, are difficult for non-native English speakers. \nThe website component is being redesigned and updated and - most importantly - we are offering an all-digital version of the book.\nWe have editors and a development team who are working with us on this version of the book.\nBecause of these changes I am very excited for Myths and Legends and I know you will absolutely love it! \nPay close attention because this is the fun part!\nBefore we get into the rewards, I have a big announcement:\nWe are offering a digital version of the book!!\nWHAAAAT!?!\nThat's right. If you like paper and pencil, we've got you covered. If shipping is not your thing, and you have some extra paper on hand, then you can get the book online. \nHere's how it will work. You will receive an access code to register on our website. Once logged in you can read the story and download a PDF of the puzzles for each activity. Once you solve the puzzles, you can complete the story, check your answers, and move on to the next one. \nHow's that for instant gratification?\nBecause we are offering the book in two different formats, we have rewards for each version.  \nLet's talk about the last two rewards for a minute.\nYour Own Puzzle Story: \nWe are giving the opportunity for 50 of you to have your very own, personalized puzzle story created by yours truly. That's right. I'll email you after the campaign to get your information and work out all the details. Then I will send you a PDF copy of the finished puzzle story. This is your chance to be creative! A puzzle story could be a great way to make an announcement, an invitation, or show someone just how much you love them. \nYou Are In The Book: \nWe will collaborate with you on a puzzle that will actually go into the book! In addition to adding the puzzle to the book, we will print your name on the page as a collaborator (with your permission, of course). I will email you after the campaign to design the puzzle and everyone will get a chance to do it when the book goes live in June.\nNew reward level added!\nWe have received a lot of requests about getting a paperback and digital copy of the book. You have two options:\n1. We added a new reward tier that includes both paperback and digital\n2. After the campaign when when we send the survey to all backers you will have the option of adding a paperback copy and/or digital copy to your pledge for $10 (plus shipping if outside the US). \nSo you can lock in both right now or wait and add it on after the campaign. \nNow for those of you who are returning from our first campaign, listen up!\nWe promised you that the sample and training packs were EXCLUSIVE to the Initiation campaign and we have kept that promise. Also, we're not the re-gifting type. \nAll of the sample and training packs in this campaign are brand new. \nSo with that, let's talk about some goals.  \n\n**Important Note on Shipping ** \nWe are using BackerKit for shipping and fulfillment. Please do not add shipping to the campaign pledge on Kickstarter. As soon as the Kickstarter campaign ends, we will send you a survey to validate your information and collect any shipping fees. \nAll paperback book rewards will ship for FREE to addresses in the US.\nInternational shipping is $8.\nWe are so eager to get started that the development of the book and website has already begun. But to make it truly match our vision, we need some help.\nThe additional funds raised through this Kickstarter campaign will be used for:\nWebsite development - we are redesigning and enhancing the experience. In addition to the key checks and Vault we are adding an all new digital version of the book. \nBook design and editing - this book will include more imagery and design. We are also using funds to hire editors to make sure the book is polished and ready for print.\nProduction costs - to print the book there are setup charges, ISBN fees, shipping supplies and other production expenses. \nHere's how the money will be spent.\nFirst of all, I want to thank you for getting this far. \nMy name is Brooklynn and I am one of the creators of Initiation and Myths and Legends. \nIf you can't tell, I have always dreamed of being a writer. My childhood was filled with stories. I have read countless books infused with Greek, Roman, Celtic, Norse, and Egyptian mythology and have always been fascinated with explorers and their discoveries. \nWhen I graduated from high school the only thing I knew I wanted to do was build a business. One of my biggest influences is Shark Tank. I love watching the passion entrepreneurs have for their projects and how the investors get involved and create something amazing from nothing. Other than wanting to write and publish, I wasn\u2019t sure what I would do.\nMy dad encouraged me to dive in and I started learning. I took in everything I could find about being an entrepreneur and building a business to prepare for when I was ready to create a product. After a lot of thought and conversation, I found a project I was excited about. Puzzles have been around for a long time and I wanted to put my own spin on it - puzzle stories!\nThe hardest part about building a business as a young entrepreneur is that you\u2019re going against people\u2019s expectations. Most kids go to college, move out of the house, and get a job and that\u2019s their beginning. But mine is a little different and most often that\u2019s hard for people to understand. \nSo I started looking for people who have done amazing things. People who decided to take the road less traveled and forge their own path. I learned about amazing women like Michaela DePrince who rose above her traumatic past to become a ballerina and Debbie Sterling who created a business that introduces young girls to engineering. Reading their stories helped give me the courage I needed to officially start something. To take the leap and that was Initiation.\nI want to thank everyone who has contributed to my journey because it\u2019s more than just a puzzle book to me, it\u2019s a beginning. I hope that you will back this project and help bring Myths and Legends, and my stories, to the world. \n- Brooklynn", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe risks to completing this project are minimal.

There are no instructions, and it won't always be obvious what to do (although hints are always available). You will need to think creatively to extract answers from the book, which can be validated on the accompanying 404 website. If you are correct, the website will unlock information which you will need to solve challenges later in the book. \nAs you progress, you will also receive further communications from the organization who sent you the book, delivered via the website. These will reveal story elements, and may include cryptic hints, including references to information hidden elsewhere.\nOnly for Backers\n404 will be sent to you in a unique edition that will never be reprinted, and arrive with a cryptic letter that only backers will ever receive - and, as a backer, you will be one of the very first to receive 404. \nHow do I play 404? \n404 is a physical book. You will probably want to write in the book, and sometimes cut it up or manipulate it. Solve the puzzles on each page to reveal words or numbers, then enter these on the website at www.book-404.com to verify them. They may be required for later puzzles. If you are wrong, but on the right track, the answer parser built into the website will tell you so - although you can disable this assistance if you wish. The website will also provide access to progressively more specific hints, so the puzzles will be accessible to all abilities of solver.\nWho is creating 404? \nI am Dr Gareth Moore, the author of over 100 best-selling international puzzle and brain-training titles. My books have sold over 7 million copies, and have been translated into over 30 different languages. They include number 1 bestsellers such as The Ordnance Survey Puzzle Book (UK only) - which sold over 125,000 copies at Christmas 2018 - and range from complex adult mystery titles through to puzzle books for kids.\nAs one of the world's best-selling puzzle authors, I am uniquely placed to create a title which will provide a sensible level of challenge throughout. The puzzles will test you, but will always be fair.\nPraise for my puzzles\nI have been called \"Britain's King of Puzzles\" by The Sun, and \"One of Britain's most trusted brain trainers\" by The Sunday Telegraph. Will Shortz described my puzzles as \"Fresh and lively\". But you don't need to just take their word for it - you can read my Amazon reviews too.\nStretch Goals\nBook Specifications\nDimensions: 5.5\" x 8.5\" (14cm x 21.5cm)\nPuzzles: 56+\nPages: 128+\nPlus additional online content, unlocked as you progress.\nWhy Kickstarter? \nThis book is not the type of book a traditional publishing house would take on. This book isn't aimed at the mass market - it's aimed at a specific type of person: you. It would cause confusion on the shelves of your local bookshop, and most publishers would not have the resources to create the accompanying interactive website. \nI want to achieve my vision for the book with as much creative control over the final product as possible. This means that I need your help to make the physical product a reality. The project goal will cover the initial print run, and enable me to place a well-produced copy of 404 in your hands, complete with the backer-exclusive letter. This letter will add to the sense of immersion the book will bring, as well as provide additional story information and clues.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere is little room for complications, given my track record of consistently producing high-quality puzzles and regular new releases.

Okay, so they were always on your mind, but this afternoon they were at the forefront of your mind, pushing aside your three open cases and even eclipsing the stack of copycat postcards the FBI had asked you to look through. \nLast you'd heard, J.C. was safe in witness protection. You even knew where, although you weren't supposed to. The FBI wasn't forthcoming with information, so all you could do was scour the internet for some mention of your friend, his family, or even The Ouroboros... (although you were careful not to attract too much attention on that front). Still, you had heard nothing, and somehow nothing was worse than something, in this case. \nA gentle shuffle told you that Alice, the mail carrier, was approaching, and your ears proved prescient as the soft thud of letters hitting the floor was followed by the squeak of the mail flap closing. You should really oil it, you told yourself, same as you did every afternoon when the mail arrived. You knew you'd never get around to it, though. \nBill. Bill. A happy birthday card from a dentist you hadn't been to in years. And then... \nYour breath caught in your throat. You recognized that handwriting. Your usually-steady hand quivered ever-so-slightly as you tore it open, not waiting to locate your knife. An assortment of postcards--familiar yet entirely alien--tumbled into your hand. Your brow knitted unconsciously as you read, eyes flicking across the back of the first card. \n\"...Please help me one last time\" it ended. You sat up straight, pulse-quickened. A drop of fear fell like a pebble in your gut, rippling outwards. And you smiled. This was something, and something was better than nothing. \nReaching for a pen you deftly spread the cards across your desk. It was time to get to work.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBlowback is a sequel to last year's Wish You Were Here, and while it can be played without having played Part I, it does pick up the story where it was left off before. \nBlowback features a set of 5 high-quality postcards packed to the brim--front-and-back--with puzzles, codes, and ciphers. Much like Wish You Were Here, they can be shared and played as a group and solved in almost any order, while they still all feed together into the overarching story and unify to complete larger, unseen puzzles within. \nTo play Blowback you will need not only your wits and hard-work, but also writing materials and an internet-connected device. The story of Blowback is set in the real-world and many of the puzzles will require you to research languages, history, science, geography, and other disciplines in order to solve them. No specialization is required beyond what you can find by digging around the internet, but your research skills will be put to the test. \nAfter listening to the feedback from Wish You Were Here, many of the puzzles in Blowback are more concise, with fewer puzzles that take a long time to decipher even after you're cracked it. As such, it provides a brisker puzzling experience and leads to an overall solve time of just around 1 hour per card. \nIf you want to get a sense of the style of puzzle you can expect in this--or any of our games--then check out our Facebook page. We post a new puzzle every Friday and often use these weekly puzzles to test out new styles and concepts we're playing with. \nThe Enigma Emporium was born in early 2018, the result of long conversations about puzzle games, subscription boxes, and our own likes and dislikes concerning what was available in the marketplace. \nWe are huge, huge fans of the genre. We've played a lot of what's available (Unlock!, EXIT, Breakout, Deadbolt, etc) and, while there was a lot we liked, there were some elements in all of those that we weren't as fond of. \nOur two primary goals are to A) Provide as immersive and aesthetic an experience as possible and B) Give as low a financial barrier to entry as possible. \nTo the first, we have done our best to make both the cards and the packaging for Blowback something beautiful that you'll will want to handle and admire and keep around even after you've solved it. \nTo our second goal, we wanted to make sure that we had a variety of prices available, and decided to start out on the lower end. So instead of a $150 mystery (or a $25 subscription that ends up being $150 6 boxes later) we kicked off with a simple, $12 set of puzzles. Down the road we certainly intend to have some larger, more elaborate games that will have a higher price point. It is important to us, however, that anyone who has any interest in what we do have multiple, excellent games that they can choose from for a very low price. \nAs many of you probably know, the success of our first campaign caught us off-guard and we were entirely unprepared with stretch goals. We don't intend to make the same mistake here, but stretch goals are also tricky for a puzzle game that has a carefully-constructed and tested internal system and narrative. So, we've come up with something we think you're really going to love. \nI am proud to present you with The Copycat Files, an entirely new game from the same world as Wish You Were Here and Blowback. The short narrative is this: After news broke about your incredible skills in helping J.C. break free via his carefully-encrypted postcards, an influx of copycat cards began to arrive on the desks of the FBI. Most were obvious fakes and wastes of time, but a few looked like they might have merit to them, so the FBI forwarded the 5 that seemed like they could lead to actual intel and have requested your assistance in deciphering them. \nThe Copycat Files is going to be a stretch goal/add-on. If we hit five key goals we will be able to produce The Copycat Files in addition to Blowback and offer is as an add-on to all backers already getting Blowback for $7 (it will retail for $15 when it's officially released). \nYou'll notice that most of these goals are social. We've calculated that, if we fund, we'll be able to produce The Copycat Files for backers at the over-half-off rate and be able to deliver just fine since we're already shipping to everyone. Our stretch goals, then, are largely focused on getting the word out. We're still a young company, so we want to be seen by as many people as possible because we know that, once people play one of our games, they'll love them. \nSo, if you want to help break through these and unlock The Copycat Files, share, like, comment, and tell your local FLGS and/or escape rooms about us! \nWe think that everything on here is completely doable and are super excited that we might be able to deliver not just one but two awesome games at the same time for a super cheap price!\nRead Kurt's full review here.\nRead REA's full review here.\nRead Toby's full review here.\nRead GeekDad's full review here.\n(Additionally, to check out review coverage of our first game Wish You Were Here check out the review section of that campaign here.)\nWe learned a lot about shipping from our experiences fulfilling Wish You Were Here. First of all, we learned that we can't ship the games in their own envelopes for a couple of reasons. First, the United States Postal Service is abysmal at delivering envelopes and we had a nearly 10% rate of failure to deliver including:\n*Lost copies\n*Failure to deliver (even though the address was correct and shipped just fine on the second try)\n*Extreme delays (letters arriving... a month after they should have).\nOn top of that, the envelopes (especially those going internationally) took a beating. Granted, the envelopes are just a temporary container for the cards, but we worked hard to make them look nice and want them to look just as nice when they reach you. \nAll of which is to say that we are now shipping all copies in individual bubble mailers. This keeps them from getting damaged in transit and the larger package also helps the USPS keep track of it, reducing the number of shipments to never reach their destination. \nThe downside is the increased cost. Whereas an envelope could ship for a stamp or two, each bubble mailer costs anywhere from $10-$13 to ship internationally. At present, we aren't planning on increasing our shipping costs as compared to our first campaign. \nWe know we aren't going to have much of a profit margin on international orders, but it's more important to us, as a young company, to continue to be accessible to everyone across the globe as we build our audience. We are still exploring options to bring the cost down, but don't know when we'll be able to implement those. \nEither way, we won't be increasing the cost on single-copy shipping and the cost of multi-item shipments will only be minimally higher. Another reason we want to heavily subsidize our shipping is because, at present, we aren't Asia or AU \"friendly\" to ship. What that means is that VAT, customs, or any other local shipping fees are not covered and processed on our end. \nUPDATE  (3/5/19): We have secured EU-friendly shipping via Spiral Galaxy, so backers in the EU won't have to worry about extra VAT or customs charges. \nNow, these games aren't too expensive, so even a 20% VAT fee isn't going to be enormous, but we wanted to subsidize the shipping as our way of offsetting any other taxes or fees you may incur locally. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFor those of you who were along for our previous campaign, you'll know that we were both careful about not over-promising while also being aggressive in what we could deliver. We pre-ordered product and began the shipping process immediately following the end of the campaign. \n\nThis time around is a little different.

As of writing this, we are just 3 likes away from our goal of 800 on Facebook, and just 3 retail pledges away from our goal of 10. We're also nearly at 700 backers. This is phenomenal and we couldn't be more grateful to everyone who's helped spread the word. \nSecond, I've been working hard behind the scenes and, while nothing is set in stone yet, it is looking very promising that we'll both be using a pledge manager and also a partner for EU fulfillment. For those who don't know, a pledge manager is a third party application that lets you easily update, add-on, and customize your pledge. You can add more copies, upgrade your tier, etc. This is especially good for us because, if we unlock , then it will likely be unlocked as a pledge manager add-on, which will help keep things simple (you'll have the option of adding $7 extra to your pledge here, or adding it later in the pledge manager).

In PARKS, players will take on the role of two hikers as they trek through different trails across four seasons of the year. While on the trail, these hikers will take actions and collect memories of the sites they visit\u2014memories being the resources in the game. Players will trade in these memories to collect National Park cards, mementos, at the end of each hike. You'll be able to purchase equipment and fill canteens to make your hikes more efficient, but at the the end of the year, it's the Park cards and photos you have collected along your journey that will win you the game. Welcome to PARKS!\nWe have all been inspired by our world at some point. In fact, if you\u2019re like the people in the audio journals we've been sharing, then you have an inspiring memory of an experience you had in the wild. The Fifty-Nine Parks Print Series reached out to us and captured our imagination with the beautiful artwork they are creating in celebration of the United States National Parks. We could not think of a better way to help celebrate with them than to develop a game that makes use of this beautiful work and helps give back to the Parks themselves.\nWe\u2019re committed to honoring national parks. Because of your help bringing this project to life, we will be making an annual donation to the National Park Service for the lifetime of this product. This donation will be based on gross retail revenue each year.\nAdditionally, Every dollar added to the tip jar in our pledge manager will be included in our first year\u2019s donation.\nPARKS' solo adventure puts you back on the trail, but this time alongside Park Rangers! Rangers will be moving alongside you as they take care of the Trail. In order to visit a site with a Ranger on top of it you'll need to use your Campfire just like in the main game.  Enjoy your hike, but don\u2019t take too long because the Season ends when the Rangers finish the trail!\nSolo Mode Includes:\n2 Hikers vs 2 Rangers\nRanger Movement correlates to the Gear cost revealed that turn\nRangers pick up Weather (Sunshine or Water) on Tiles they land on and it is placed in their Tracker\nIf Rangers collect three Sunshine or three Water, then the corresponding event is triggered such as a Government Shutdown. After its action resolves, a new card is revealed\nRangers skip over tiles with Hikers as they don't want to impose on the Hikers' experience of the Trail, but they don\u2019t mind sharing a space with each other\nThe first Ranger to reach trail end will close down a Park and select an additional effect\nHikers caught on the trail when season ends cannot take any further actions until the next season\nOfficial Solo Rules available in the rules folder above\nOur love of board games all started with a standard deck of cards\u2014so when Fifty-Nine Parks brought up the prospect of doing playing cards as well, we jumped at the opportunity! Each face-card will house a park for a total of 12 Parks in the deck. In this set you\u2019ll find: Acadia, Arches, Everglades, Grand Canyon, Great Smoky, Joshua Tree, Mount Rainier, Olympic, Rocky Mountain, Yellowstone, Yosemite, and Zion. The deck will be made with the United States Playing Card Company on premium card stock featuring sustainable forest paper and vegetable-based and metallic inks. \nThe items below are things you can add to your order through Backerkit after the campaign is over.\nHow do I add these cool things?\nYou can look through the items below, select the ones you are interested in, see how much they all cost, and add that amount to your pledge right now if you want. This extra money will appear as a credit in Backerkit. You do NOT have to do this! Once the campaign is over, you will be sent a link to finalize your order. All the things will be there.\nThe Fifty-Nine Parks Print Series is a celebration of our National Parks. The strength of the series comes from an eclectic mix of artists and the unique beauty of each park. Every screen printed poster is printed here in the USA. Fifty-Nine Parks' goal is to get poster fans into the parks and parks fans into posters. The full series is currently being archived by The Library of Congress.\nVisit their website for more details and to view their collection of wonderful prints, many of which are available for purchase.

Here are some things you should know before you pledge:\n1) You must be an authorized BRICK & MORTAR reseller (you will be asked to provide your reseller's certificate) in the US, Canada, EU/UK, or Australia. If your store is located elsewhere, you must arrange your own US/CA/EU/UK/AUS based freight forwarder.\n2) By pledging, you are agreeing to purchase a minimum of 1 half case of PARKS. In the pledge manager, you will be able to increase your order by half and full case increments. Regardless of your order quantity, you will be receiving 1 free copy to be used for demos in your store. All copies you receive will include all unlocked stretch goals and any Kickstarter Exclusive materials unlocked by the campaign. Distribution copies of the game will NOT include Kickstarter Exclusive materials.\n3) Additionally, you will be able to order playing cards by the \"brick\" (increments of 12 decks). Shipping will be charged separately for playing cards. \n4) The pledge amount you are making is a deposit and does not reflect the full charge of the minimum order. After the campaign has ended, we will contact you for your resellers certificate and you will be able to select your quantity in BackerKit. Your payment will be due in BackerKit once the game has arrived at Port in the US/EU/AUS. In addition to your BackerKit receipt, we will provide separate invoices upon request.\n5) We will cover the shipping cost for your order. If you have any additional questions (e.g. the price breakdown per unit), please reach out to Keymaster games by email or through the KS messaging system.\n6) Fulfillment on these orders will be congruent with the fulfillment of individual backers. We will plan to send out updates to retailers specifically, as the need arises, through Kickstarter Updates.\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\nYou are responsible for confirming your pledge, address and other information required to ship your product to you in a timely manner. If you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed.\nAfter two shipping attempts to your provided address have failed, you will be responsible for any additional postage/shipping costs to ship out your rewards again.\nWe plan to promote and sell retail copies of PARKS at Gen Con.

In this video I will walk through the second escape room of the Trainwrecked campaign (see campaign info at bottom of page). I'm a pretty poor public speaker, so please forgive me for this my poor delivery! \nEverything in this video is a work in progress. Nothing is set in stone. Thanks for watching!\nPLAY\n\nEscape Rooms\nEscape rooms are typically physical rooms where you are \"locked in\" and have to figure out how to escape. They normally last an hour or two, come decked out in a theme, and offer a limited number of clues in case you get stuck.\nUsing Alexa for an Escape Room\nConventional escape rooms normally require a handful of people. They are built for groups, and consist of multiple puzzles that can be solved simultaneously. This means that it would be difficult for a single player to take on an escape room alone, if your local escape room would even let you go in without a group! Alexa Skills, on the other hand, are typically designed around a single-player experience. You can challenge all the escape rooms in this Alexa Skill solo, but feel free to call a friend (you're gonna need help).\nCompelling Story\nWith a single-player experience in mind, we will create a more immersive environment than physical escape rooms. Each escape room will play a role in a larger story, and you will be able to carry some items from previous rooms with you when you leave. Additionally, some information from previous rooms will help you in later rooms. Some things can't be taken with you, but you can always take notes on paper. Sometimes you'll need clues from previous rooms (like those random numbers you thought were meaningless), so there is a good chance your notes will prove useful later in the game since you won't always be able to go back to previous rooms. You'll be able to escape each room regardless of what items or clues you have from the previous rooms, but these extra puzzles will lead to special encounters and sometimes even additional rooms to escape.\nClues will be interconnected in such a way that some of them will evolve as you learn more. For example, a golden watch set to 12:35 will give you 4 numbers for solving a puzzle in the first room, but in the next room's bonus puzzle when the player must enter the \"last two Fibonacci numbers\" they will know to enter 3 and 5. This would help you solve the escape room in a unique way or it would just give you a better insight into the plot in general, depending on the exact situation. As you progress in a campaign, you might even start to feel like you are a part of something bigger.\nCampaigns\nWhen you escape from whatever room you were locked in, most escape rooms just say \"Congratulations on escaping!\" That's great and all, but in my mind I always wonder what happens next. You've gotten out of a room, but now you are in a random hallway in an unknown building. The person who locked you up might be somewhere else inside and who knows which door leads outside of the building, or even if you'll know where you are once you get all the way out! \nCampaigns will provide you will the full picture. They offer multiple escape rooms within a story. They'll follow the same theme and have connected clues. When you start a campaign, you will have no idea what is going on, but by the end of the campaign you will likely know who captured you, exactly where you are, and maybe even why.\nThree example campaigns are depicted by the images above. Trainwreck is a campaign where an everyday commute turns into a nuclear experience. Next, Pirates on the High Seas is a comedic adventure of a Captain who just wants to find some hidden treasure. Lastly, The House revolves around a mysterious house in the middle of the forest. We already have rough drafts outlining these three campaigns.\nThe official release will include one free introductory campaign with two linear rooms and five premium campaigns, each with five non-linear rooms. These rooms will not have a time limit and can be re-played as often as desired. Premium campaigns will likely be priced at $9.99, which reflects an estimated five hours of fun (about one hour per room). The stretch goals will unlock much longer campaigns, which will have the same pricing, even those that are three times as long.\nWeekly Competitive Challenge\nThe competitive Challenge is a rotating category with a different escape room each week. At the time of release, there will be a total of 26 unique escape rooms within this category (they will repeat after six months). If competitive mode is popular, more rooms will be added.\nThe competitive challenge will require a ticket to participate, and you can only participate in a challenge once (because once you figure out the solution, doing the same room a second time is trivial). Results will be recorded and a leaderboard will be available. Each ticket will likely be priced at $4.99, but there will be a special incentive given to those who participated the previous week. I'm still working out what that incentive would be - a discount to everyone who beat a certain time, a free ticket to the top 10% on the leaderboard, or something like that. Feel free to weigh in on this in the comments.\nMultiple Ways To Escape\nSome rooms will have multiple ways to escape, as well as optional puzzles that lead to extra parts of the story. These extras will help provide you with information or items that will be useful later on, and choosing to escape one way or another can lead to different rooms. If you escape through the window then you'll end up outside, but if you escape through the door then you end up in an entirely different place. That isn't to say one option is better than the other, they'll just offer different experiences. The first time you play through a campaign, you have to do it in order, but once you beat a room you can replay it without having to do the other parts of the campaign. This means that you won't ever have to go through the first couple campaign rooms just to try to solve a room another way.\nStretch Goals\nWe have a ton of ideas for puzzles and escape rooms, so if there is enough funding they will definitely happen! Depending on how many of these goals are met, they might not all make it into the official release. We want to maintain our promise on the release date (November) so any stretch goals not complete by the release will be made available as soon as they are developed. Each stretch goal campaign is substantially longer than the five base premium campaigns.\nA magic based campaign is something we really think would be fun. Spells and potions, even talking animals. When magic is involved, anything is possible Something about being captured at the top of an evil wizard's tower sounds like it is full of strange and interesting encounters.\nBeing an astronaut would be cool, until your spaceship malfunctions. You'll encounter alien technology and debris from other shuttles. If you play your cards right, you might make it back to Earth. Better make sure your space suit is operational before heading outside!\nCastles and an underwater labyrinth! These are two unrelated campaigns. The castle could go multiple ways, maybe you are a noble who was framed for murdering the king or maybe you are a master thief who was locked in the dungeon. Either way sounds fun. The underwater labyrinth will be the first timed campaign. You'll have some scuba gear for sure, but you only have so much oxygen. Better find an escape route quick!\nThis is a big one. We're not saying that every single interaction will have a unique voice. Alexa will still be the one who responds to you when you say you want to take an action. This is referring to story elements. When you find a recording or when you overhear a conversation, it would be cool if those were actual voices and not Alexa's voice. \nThe weekly competitive challenges is about to level up! Unlock this stretch goal and we will double the number of unique challenges available. This means that we will have enough for one whole year of unique competitive escape rooms.\nWhen we talk about RPG-style, we mean skills and stats. Maybe even a monster, but the backbone will be around getting power-ups to increase stats. You definitely can't break down the door without at least +2 strength! I'm an anime fan and am pretty excited for an anime campaign. I have some great ideas but you might have to be familiar with anime to understand them all, we're still debating on whether you'll need to have prior knowledge of popular anime to complete the puzzles or not!\nGo back to high school with this stretch goal. We haven't decided if you'll be escaping class and evading the principal, or if this is a darker story. The office escape campaign is in no way related to the office at school. Instead, its more about getting out of work without your boss knowing.\nThe escape rooms up till now will vary in difficulty but we expect most players to be able to solve them. This one though, you better be good. You might even need to bring in a friend, and you'll definitely need to get out some papers and pencils (yes, plural)... might even want to start making some mind maps on a whiteboard if you have one. When we talk about extreme difficulty, we aren't just saying it will be twice as long as the other campaigns. We're saying it will be twice as tough too! We're going to have a lot of fun making this extra difficult campaign, so please help us reach this goal! \nCan We Pull This Off\nHi, I'm Pat O'Donnell and I've been saying \"we\" a lot in this campaign. I'm referring not only to myself and a few people who are going to help me, but also to all of you backers. In order to pull this off, we need a few things: funding, ideas, and programming code. \nFunding will (hopefully) be reached by the end of this campaign, so that's covered. Funding will cover story-writing, puzzle designers, testers for each room, server costs, and coding hours. This funding will cover everything up to our release date of November.\nPuzzle and escape room ideas are a bit much for just me so I have a few others who will be providing help on those lines. They will also be helping with the story. Depending on the stretch goals, we could end up with near 100 different escape rooms, and with multiple puzzles per room. We already have a lot of campaign ideas, and coming up with a campaign theme naturally leads to ideas for the individual escape rooms, so we shouldn't have much trouble here. With the amount of time we've scheduled for this project, we have more than enough time to come up with ideas.\nWriting the code is my area of expertise. I am a software developer with many years of experience, and I've already done some exploratory work to verify that this project won't run into anything weird or unusual. While this is my first Kickstarter campaign, I'm familiar with all the technologies involved and I've included some extra time in the timeline just in case anything comes up that could interfere with development.\nThis is all to say that we have the necessary personnel to make project this a reality, and we've already put together some great ideas. All of the base campaigns already have rough drafts started, so after funding we'll be able to hit the ground running. I'll share one of the rough drafts below.\nRough Draft:  Campaign - Trainwrecked\nPlot: The player is on a train that goes near Area 51. An alien aircraft crashes nearby and the debris derails the train. The player must escape the train wreckage. Government agents take away the alien and the survivors from the wreck (only the player survived). The player is put in a holding cell while the agents debate what to do. The player must escape from the cell, evade the agents, and secure a vehicle in order to escape the facility. The facility is in the middle of nowhere, so escaping on foot is not an option.\nRoom 1 - The Train: The escape room begins in a private cabin of the train, after the train has crashed. After listening to Alexa set the stage, the player will use voice commands to navigate the room and investigate objects. The player will find many things, namely a keypad for the door and a manual for the keypad saying the code is the cabin number. The cabin number is written on the floor as 6181, but the actual cabin number is 1819 due to the perspective of the player being messed up with the cabin being flipped on its side in the crash. If the player guesses wrong on the keypad, it runs out of power and they must find batteries and a screwdriver (elsewhere in the room) to fix it. Once the door is open, the player must find a way to climb up and through the door (the door is on the ceiling due to the flipped train).\nOnce the player escapes the cabin, there are two more major obstacles. First is a raging fire in the between the cabin door and the emergency exit from the train. Second is that the emergency exit was damaged by the crash and the player must reconnect the wiring system using clues. Some clues are back in the original cabin, so the player may need to go back there if the clues weren't found.\nWhen the player escapes through the emergency exit, the escape room is complete and the player must choose which items to keep for the next escape room. However, the campaign is not over. The train crashed because it was hit by an alien ship that crash landed. Once outside the train, the player and the alien ship are taken by secret agents for investigation, questioning, and potential silencing. The player saw something confidential, of course. \nRoom 1 - The Train is just the first escape room in the whole campaign. There are three more (escaping the cell, evading the agents, and securing a vehicle are brief descriptions of what those other three rooms entail) and there is also one hidden room, reached by escaping the cell in a special way. This room lets has the player encountering the alien ship and if they play their cards right, the player may end up getting a special item from the alien. The special item will be useful for later campaigns.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRegardless of the challenge, I will always be transparent about it. Whether it is a delay or an issue with a major feature, you can expect to be made aware of all the details with consistent updates. As you can see from the campaign, we have a lot already planned out. We are past the point of most major problems and the worst thing that could happen at this point is not being ready by the release date, but we've planned more time than we think we'll need so rest easy.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Pat O'Donnell\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nI'm a software developer with a passion for learning new technologies.See more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Thank you for your support!", "descp": "I appreciate all my backers.

It is a challenging puzzle!\nPlay cards and have a great time with family and friends while admiring a wonderful piece of art.\nThe Personal Touch\nThe ranks are sampled from Vincent's own handwriting from personal letters to his brother, Paul Gauguin, and others.

You may choose your version of the game during the pledge manager. \nAVGhost: Paranormal Investigation is a cooperative game for 1 to 4 players, where you will take control of a team of paranormal investigators. All of them are part of a specialized agency that investigates and solves paranormal events and poltergeist. In the game, you will be hired by several people with issues, who will request you to cleanse their homes from troublesome ghosts and spirits. AVGhost Includes 6 different cases to investigate, with a total duration of nearly 30 hours of gameplay. The game is designed to be played in the dark, with support from a digital APP that will reveal clues, add background music and will startle you with the sounds and voices from different paranormal events. But you may also  play with the lights on and without the APP, by using the investigation booklet to completely replace the digital APP. \nInvestigators painted By Studio Giraldez. Sample paint. Miniatures come unpainted.\n HOW TO PLAY?\nAVGhost is divided in two main phases: \nFirst goes the meeting phase, when the players will open and examine the case\u2019s file (each case includes its own folder), where they will find information, inserts and other details to examine. Your client\u2019s first statement to the agency is also included here. Within all this information, your team will receive clues to help you decide how to investigate the haunted site. You will also find numbered overhead transparencies, to place on the different boards.\nAs an example, if your client says \u201cI\u2019ve heard voices in the bedroom\u201d, it is quite likely that your team needs to place an audio recording device in the bedroom. At first, during the first cases, these clues will be easier to spot. \nOnce the players have decided which gadgets to use and where, place the appropriate tokens on the board. The meeting phase represents the first visit to the site, during daytime, and the placement of all the gear to start the investigation. \nWhen using the APP, you will need to mark which characters are in play, the gear they are using to search for clues, and the place where said gear is placed. Then, after this selection, the APP will show a \u201cStart\u201d button.\n                 This is the time for you to turn off the lights in the room, and to turn on the flashlights of your investigators. \nAnd with this you will start the second phase of the game: the investigation. The players will have to check their gear and see if it collected any information. \nOnce the player reaches the place where their gear is, check the APP to see the results. If you hear an audio after pressing an investigator\u2019s button, be it the investigator\u2019s voice narrating what it\u2019s witnessing or a recording from your gear, that will mean you found a clue. On the contrary, if you didn\u2019t place the right gadget in the correct location, you will hear static, meaning that you did not find anything. In this case, the APP will open again, giving you the chance to change your gear. \nDuring the game, you will have 3 different investigation lines to follow and solve each case. First, you will have to find individual clues, after placing your gear. Second you will have to look for the numbered clues in the different locations and objects on site. By investigating these clues you will get new information and find new places to search. In most cases, you will have to go to choose from two possible paths. These clues (which can be consulted again after revealing them) will tell you the complete story of the case you are investigating. Finally, the APP will trigger random paranormal events (in the spirit of horror movie scares) which will surprise and even startle you. You will also have to solve these events to finish the investigation. \nThis way, once you\u2019ve found the 4 audio clues (depending on the case), found every correct numbered clue on the board and solved every paranormal event, the case will be solved and the site cleansed. \nFlashlight color filters:\n                 The bases of the investigator miniatures include a mount to place different color filters, to change the light you are using. These filters will be essential to banish the ghosts you will meet. Each color affects a different type of ghost. Switch your flashlight filter during the game to banish every one of them. You will also need these filters to reveal different clues, since many of them are only visible under specific types of light. The investigators will find new filters while searching for clues or in hidden spots of the board.  \nFear and flashlight battery tracks: \nYou will receive fear points on your character\u2019s sheet when the ghosts appear before you, according to their type, your current flashlight filter, and if you are alone or not at that time. When your fear track reaches its peak, your investigator will fall into shock and will need the aid of an ally to recover. \nThe batteries in your flashlight will also run out with use, and sometimes will be affected in extreme ways when you meet ghosts. If an investigator runs out of batteries for their flashlight, the player will have to turn its flashlight off and wait for an ally to bring them new batteries. Batteries can be found in different places of the board, searching for clues, places or objects. \nFilters: Use them to banish ghosts, to protect yourself from them, to obtain certain items, to reveal certain clues, etc.\nClues: Clues can be found on the map, either by exploring the map, or by using your gadgets and filters. Some of the clues will be on the board, others will be on each cases unique transparencies. The investigations lines will cross paths and combine with each other.\nGadgets: The gadgets will be used to collect clues during the meeting phase, but they will also be used during the investigation to deal with certain situations and to collect more data.\nEvents: Events are unique for each case and will present different situations to the investigators. They will trigger randomly during your investigation.\nInvestigators: Each of them has their unique gear that will be used at different times of the game.\nOther things you will find in AVGhost:\nPossessions: Sometimes your investigators will be possessed by evil spirits. On some occasions, you will have to scare your allies to solve the problem, on others, your teammates will have to scare the spirit that possessed you, either with flashlight bursts, or by performing an exorcism.\nMoving clues: Some ghosts will move clues on the map to make the investigation harder. Special items: On many occasions, you will have to use special items for your investigation, such as finding a key for a specific lock, solving small puzzles, or using special items, that you will find during your investigation to solve specific situations, like showing an item to a ghost to enrage it.\nCooperative goals: The game is fully cooperative. Sometimes you will need to coordinate your team for specific tasks. For example, having two of them pull on a lever while the other two push up a service lift from a lower level to unjam it.\n\u201cCase: Grace\u201d is an expansion that brings you a campaign formed by 3 cases. We must solve them in order to unveil the whole story and solve the mystery. This expansion is Kickstarter Exclusive. \nIn the Grace Case, our investigators will have to discover the truth of what happened in this strange case where secret services, spies, bizarre experiments, grotesque surgical practices, relics and occultism are involved. This expansion for AVGhost brings 10 more hours of gameplay. Aside from the 3 folders from each of the cases in this campaign, you will also get the miniature of the ghost Grace. \nENGLISH RULEBOOK (Provisional version, subject to change) DROPBOX.

This leads to frustration and ultimately abandoning what you set out to accomplish. This interactive book keeps you engaged and encourages you to stick with it!\nAs a product design industry veteran and owner of an online educational design training business,  I\u2019ve been surrounded by artists and designers of all skill levels. But the one thing they all had in common was they began with the basic fundamentals of drawing. The BASICS.\nWhat is this book about?\nWhen I was six years old, my mother gave me a 2B pencil and blank sketchbook and I just started drawing. Whatever and whenever I could. Early on I used to draw from picture books, magazines, whatever I could find. I learned the basics on my own. It wasn\u2019t until my first high school Art Class where I began to learn the proper fundamentals and principles of drawing. That changed my life forever!\nIt's because of that experience that I wanted to create a book that I feel will help shape another artists life.  \nThe goal of this book is to provide aspiring designers and artists with a solid foundation of drawing techniques.  Most importantly, it will provide the tools needed to pursue a career in any design field. \nThis sketchbook will help you build your confidence and strengthen your knowledge of the Basics.\nIn this book, I am sharing all of the knowledge I have developed through my years of experience as an artist in the product design industry. This is the book I have dreamed of for years, and the book I wish I had when I first started out. It will not disappoint. \nSince we launched our first sketchbook four years ago, we've made lots of improvements.  Starting with BETTER paper quality.  It's because of backer feedback and suggestions from you that we're able to create and even better sketchbook.\nWe having already successfully published \u201chow-to\u201d sketchbooks on Shoes, Figures, Cars and Super Heroes.

Masterworks borrows from all these precedents without adding unnecessary complexity.  \nWe have added four new dice types, but their functions are very simple:\nTwo are \"dual dice\" (metal/magic and wood/gem)\nOne copies the basic dice (metal, wood, gem, magic)\nOne gives fun, unpredictable bonuses (e.g. +3 to a die matching it)\nIt's all about supporting a flexible dice pool.\nDuring crafting, if you roll well enough to make an item\u2014you'll be one step closer to winning. Roll poorly, though, and those dice and your turn could feel wasted. With Masterworks, you can spend unused metal dice to bid on the exotic dice. In this way, you \"craft\" the new dice. \nAmbassador's Row: Use dice rolled during crafting to impress foreign dignitaries staying at the palace. Craft the best \"bid\" for their attention and get a sample of their new exotic die. Exotic dice are single use only, but they remain from round to round until used. \nYou start each round on the bottom half of the board in the Gather phase. Here you spend dice to get more or better dice and crafting bonuses. The new row below the board gives you more powerful (i.e. cheaper) options. But you only get one choice from this row per round\u2014make it count!\nGriffin's Landing: One distinguished guest from each realm arrives each round. This creates a row of Visitor Cards, a special type of gather card that represents hosting or collaborating. Since hosting is time consuming, each player only gets one Visitor Card per round.\nMasterworks is all about easy-to-see options on the table. The set-up doesn't even change based on the player count, it's always the same two extra rows above and below the main board organized from West to East. Download a draft of the rules for a more detailed overview. \nPlease note that these rules are a work in progress!\nThe return of griffins has opened the kingdom up to the wonders of the whole world. As the Kickstarter campaign progresses, we will be revealing new game content from the four realms each day: \nThe magic and stillness of the North (Update #2)\nThe beauty of the Near and Far East (Update #3)\nThe energy and vitality of the South (Update #4)\nThe spirit and independence of the West (Update #5)\nUpdates will be coming as the majestic world of Masterworks is steadily unveiled\u2014so keep an eye out for those!\nEvery holiday season, the Silent Knight watches solemnly. He knows who's been bad and good. Throughout the world of King's Forge, people are on their best behavior because he rewards good deeds. \nIn the spirit of the Silent Knight, this version of Masterworks is already upgraded for Kickstarter backers.

At Starling Games, we strive to create games for the hobbyist gamer, crafting elegant mechanics with beautiful artwork and top-notch components. Some of our most popular titles include Everdell, Alien Frontiers, Black Orchestra, King's Forge, and more.\n\nOur team has delivered hundreds of successful Kickstarter products since 2012, including our own published titles and those we've helped independent publishers run and fulfill. While printing, shipping, and processing delays are always a possibility, we have set a reasonable delivery date based on our experience.\n\nReplacements\nWe are always happy to replace defective or damaged dice, cards, or other components. Just send us photos of the damage, and we will ship a replacement at no additional cost to you. If your item needs to be returned, we will cover the cost of the return shipping. We provide replacement pieces while titles are active in our catalog, which is typically at least a year after their initial printing. Replacement requests must be made within 30 days of the date the item was delivered to you. For replacement requests, please go to www.starling.games/replacements.\n\nKickstarter Refunds\nIf you'd like a refund before your item ships, you have until one week before the scheduled ship date to request one. We can offer you a 90% refund since Kickstarter retains about 10% of your pledge for various fees. If there is something wrong with your item, we appreciate the opportunity to replace or exchange it. If a refund is preferred and there is no defect with the product, you'll be responsible for shipping it back to us. Upon receipt of the returned item, we'll issue you a 90% refund. Refund requests must be made within 30 days of the date the item was delivered to you. For more questions about refunds, please go to www.starling.games/questions.\n\nCommunity\nWhen this campaign concludes, we'll invite you to join our Life & Times of a Board Game newsletter.

They are now in-hand and ship immediately after the Kickstarter!  \nSo we say \"Welcome!\" to you, and hope you decide to bring home a pair of the Limited Run sets we're offering here.  Less than 150 sets remain!\nDid someone say... \"Stocking Stuffer\"!?\n Set #1: Christmas Dice \nChristmas Dice Halfsies Dice are a gorgeous and unique Red Berry and a super dark Holly Leaf blue-green, with Gold Ink, here to adore the Christ child.\n Set #2: Winter Wonderland \nWinter Wonderland Halfsies Dice are a sharp and classy Pine Green and Snow White, with Silver Ink, here to play with the Christ child. : )\nBoth sets are standard 7-die RPG sets, with all the quality Halfsies Dice are famous for.\nPledge confidently, knowing your friends will love these dice.\nA Christmas gift for every backer! \nEvery order comes shipped in a Christmas-themed dice bag, on us.\n*Coal not included.\nSamples shown. Final selection of 9 options have been chosen by the backers!\nSize: 4x6in.  Holds 40-50 dice!  \nDice Bag Add Ons:\nWe invite you to add extra bags to your order as a great gift-presentation option.\n+$4 per bag\nGet +4 bags for only +$12 (net $3 each!)\nGet one of each of all 9 bags for +$24 (net $2.67 each!)\nAll bags, both free and add-ons, are selected randomly from 9 possible designs (5 examples shown).  All bags in any given order will each be unique!, no repeats, so if you order the +8 bags option, you'll get one of every design! \nMath: That's a total pledge of $47 to get both dice sets and all 9 bags before Christmas!  That's a lot of gifts!  : )\n+$3 Shipping fee applies (Flat rate, regardless of quantity of added bags.  All shipping collected after the campaign).\nFinal designs subject to change.\nHow can I get both sets by this Christmas!?\nPledge for the Limited Quantity Tier entitled \"This Christmas (2018)\".  Only backers at this Tier will get them before Christmas.  All other backers will get them next year for Christmas-in-July.\nCan I pledge for only one set, and get it before Christmas?  \nTo ensure the most efficient handling of this, in the short time before Christmas, only the \"This Christmas (2018)\" Tier will get them in time for Christmas, which includes both sets.  A couple fortunate backers on the \"Next Christmas (2019)\" Tier may luck out and get them this year anyway, by a random draw. Why?  Because, Saint Nicholas is cool like that!\nCan I get more than one of each before Christmas? ...or after?\nFor this, you have two options: \n#1) Pledge to the \"This Christmas (2018)\" Tier, and add +$11 per extra set you would like.  Your first two sets (one of each) will come before this Christmas.  All extra sets (beyond the first pair) will ship with phase 2 in July 2019.  You pay for all your dice shipping upfront, 2nd shipping phase is included in pricing.\n#2) Pledge.  Then ask a family member to also pledge under their account.  \nCan I them before Hanukkah?\nHanukkah is very early this year.  We will do our best to ship Hanukkah requests ASAP, but I don't believe we'll hit December 2nd.  There's a very good chance that in the USA you'll get them by December 10th, but I can't promise it.  Please email me if you would like me to prioritize your shipping in time for Hanukkah.  It would be my pleasure.\nWho are you going to give them to?  What craft are going to make with them?\nOk, that's me asking you.  Tell me in the comments!\nGot any other questions?\nAsk me in the comments!  I love comments!\nThis campaign is the first of its kind for us!  There are no Stretch Goals! : O\nWe've given every offering right up front, even the free dice bag in every order!  \nWe want you to be able to pledge confidently, knowing exactly what you're getting from go.  This has the bonus of eliminating potential post-campaign hiccups, so we can guarantee on-time shipping.\nWe've decided to make this campaign 100% grass roots.  We're not going to do any paid advertising aside from a small Facebook message to spread the word on the first few days.\nSo we need your help telling people!

One in time for Christmas 2018, and a second in July 2019.  All dice bags ordered will come with your first (2018) shipment, so you may use them as gifts if you like.\n\"Next Christmas (2019)\" Shipping Chart\nIf ALL of your order ships in 2019, expect these shipping costs:\nThe above pricing reflects the cost for one shipment of all items together, in 2019. \nShipping Info for both Shipping timelines:\nShipping for all pledges will be collected immediately after the campaign via our simplified pledge manager.\nEstimated Ship Date: All orders will ship by December 6th, St. Nicholas Day.  If we max out early enough, and Pledge Manager addresses come in fast, we can beat that date by a whole week and ship out most orders by November 29th.  \nAdd on Dice Bags: Got any extra Christmas Themed dice bags in your pledge?  Expect +$3 shipping.\n**Shipping for this campaign is not EU friendly.  I apologize.  Bulk-customs won't let them through fast enough to then re-ship them individually from inside the EU in time.  We are confident, though, that we can get them parcel delivered from the States to your home in time!

Best of all, domestic backers are guaranteed to receive these stockings in time for Christmas 2018!\nThis will be a short and direct Kickstart. There will be no stretch goals, but every backer receiving rewards will receive a set of dice which will be included in their shipment in addition to the items from their selected reward level. This should help 'kickstart' your stocking stuff efforts in style! See The RPG Sets section for more details.\nThe Dice Stocking is our highest quality and largest dice bag to date. That's right! It can serve as both a sturdy stocking to hang from your mantle and also as a dice bag complete with drawstring! These stockings are as tough as Yukon Cornelius and strong as the Bumble. They can hold a whopping TWENTY FIVE standard sets of RPG dice and the loop can take the weight. These are not the cheap stockings found on most store shelves - they are built geek tough and will last for many years!\nThe green exterior is a soft, low pile velvet material - not the stiff velvet you see in a lot of small dice bags. The red interior is smooth satin like all our bags. The red drawstring stays tight when pulled and the loop can take the weight. Put these out for the holidays and Santa will surely reward you and yours with loads of geeky goodness!\nAnd for those of you with a sharp eye, that glowing, oversized d20 on the mantle is made by none other than Jolly Blackburn over at Amber's Secret Cove. Check out their line of great products!\nThe stockings come in two distinct designs that backers can choose from during the pledge manager process. You can choose from the The Dice Stocking or The Geek Stocking for each bag you receive! Although the retail on these stockings will be $15, backers of this project will be able to purchase additional stockings in the pledge manager for $13.\nMany Uses!\nHere are a few of the uses we thought of!\nThe Reward Levels\nThere is a reward tier for each reindeer! More directly, there are 5 distinct reward levels of which four have an early bird level. This has led to more reward levels that preserves the theme and gives our backers greater opportunity to get a deal!\nThe RPG Sets\nThe dice are standard sized RPG sets consisting of 7 dice per set and each of the options feature a 'pearlescent' design that shimmers in the light. They are good quality and we are offering ten different color mixes that backers can choose from as part of the pledge manager process. You can pick the color for each and every set that you back for from the available colors! These are great dice and perfect for backers who like to customize their dice by re-inking.\nEvery backer receiving rewards will get one of these sets included with their rewards to help start the stocking stuffing properly! As with any set backed for or purchased in the pledge manager, backers can select the color option for this included set from the ten offered on the project during the pledge manager.\nThese dice will not not be offered by Black Oak on our web store - we are only offering them as part of this project. Backers will have the option of adding additional sets as part of the pledge manager at a cost of $5 per set.\nAdd Ons\nAll Black Oak Workshop products currently in stock will be available for purchase during the pledge manager, so you can be sure to pick up some extra geek and dice goodness to fill your new stocking with!\nRetailers\nWe would love to earn your business retailers! Verified brick and mortar stores are welcome to back at the single bag level and then contact Black Oak through the project or through our website here. Retailers receive a 50% discount with a 10 stocking minimum order. You can expect to receive your orders well before Christmas (just as all backers will). This will mean there will be enough time to get these in front of your customers!\nShipping\nWe have an excellent success rate at meeting or even beating delivery goals from all of our previous projects so you can count on these making it in time. If you back, you will receive these by Christmas of 2018. Our only exception here is international backers. We cannot guarantee shipments to international backers will arrive by Christmas. However, we can guarantee they will ship the first week of December which should allow plenty of time, but there is no way we can provide any assurance for those backers outside of the USA.\nThank you for checking out our project!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf funded, our priority will be to meet or exceed backer expectations.

You are the detective, and these 5 carefully-crafted postcards contain every answer that you're seeking. \nUse your knowledge of codes and ciphers, your ability to research and cross-reference, and your creativity and outside-the-box thinking to solve the myriad puzzles and mysteries contained in the cards. \nThe Enigma Emporium was founded by puzzlers for puzzlers. We've taken everything that we've learned from decades of experience with puzzles, games, mystery boxes, and escape rooms and have made something new and unique that we hope you'll love. \nCase closed. You caught the blackmailer in the act and, pending trial, it looked like he'd be going away for 5-7. You came back to the office because you'd forgotten some paperwork, but there was an envelope dangling from your office's mail slot. Odd, since the day's mail came hours ago before you'd even left the office. That meant either special delivery or (you checked the envelope for a postage mark) a hand-delivery. \nBefore opening it, you performed your customary checks: Return address? None. Envelope? Heavy parchment. Expensive. Foreign? Handwriting? Tense, strained, and masculine. \nYour knife blade clicks sharply open in otherwise silent office and you slip it carefully under the seal, wary of marring anything you might need later. Out into your hand tumble 5 postcards, all from different sources, each stamped months apart. They're strange, foreign, confusing... until you spot one that seems to make some sense. \"Hello, detective,\" it begins. You flip it over, momentarily, reading the large letters on the front. \"Wish you were here.\" \nYour lips purse together softly, thoughtfully, as you sink into your chair without realizing it. \"You'll not know my name, but I know you,\" you continue to read while your other hand reaches blindly for the paper and pen you always keep in the side drawer...\n Wish You Were Here is different from many other such puzzles in a few key ways. First, everything you need from us you will receive all at once. There are no subscriptions, no mailers, no waiting around for more information before you can finish solving the puzzles. \nYou also won't need to damage or destroy any part of these cards in order to solve them (although photocopying is encouraged if writing on the cards will help you). That way, upon completion you are left with a beautiful set of cards that you can either save as a keepsake or pass on to a friend to see if they can solve the mystery as quickly as you did. \nResearch is not only recommended, but will also be necessary to solve many of these puzzles as they are set in the real world and use actual facts from history, geography, science, etc. You won't be expected to know much information off the top of your head (although some familiarity with common puzzle types will help you out) and Google is a useful tool. Similarly, here are a few other tools that might prove useful in these, or other, puzzles. \nCaesar Cipher Decoder\nReverse Image Search (click the camera icon in the search bar)\nMorse Code Translator\nA List of Common Codes and Ciphers\nRemember, none of these are guaranteed to be useful for solving Wish You Were Here, but they are all useful tools for anyone aspiring to be a great puzzle solver. \nFinally, there will be a 'Clues' section built for each of our puzzles on TheEnigmaEmporium.com which you will receive a link to along with your postcards. This will offer two increasingly-specific hints for each puzzle, as well as a solution for each (although you may still have to do some decoding after you learn how).\nREMEMBER: You can't unsee a hint. There's no clock ticking here, so take your time. Only get a hint if you absolutely need to, because there's no going back from there and we would hate for you to spoil anything for yourself. \n So, originally we had no plans to include any manner of stretch goals in this campaign. Not because we were holding out on you, we promise! Really, it was the opposite of that. We wanted to include everything we possibly could from the very start. We didn't want to dangle extra puzzles or component upgrades or anything else that should, by rights, be included already. So we made the whole story, as many puzzles as we needed, and we found the quality of production and materials that we thought was best, and then we pressed \"Launch.\" \nWell, in just 7 hours we funded and, as I write this, we're 4 days in and on our way to 400% percent funded. That's amazing. That's something special. And moreover that gave us financial flexibility to start thinking bigger. We pressed \"start\" on some projects that we couldn't before, like hiring a coder to work on the digital elements of the game. But, more importantly, as we looked at the steadily climbing pledges, we realized that we had to give you all something else, something special. So we decided that once we cross the $8,000 mark (which may well happen in the next couple days) we are going to add an extra 6th postcard to all of your pledges.\n This postcard will be a follow-up to the already-complete story told by the first five. As such, you will want to set it aside when you receive it and not dig too much into it until you've finished Wish You Were Here. This card will be included in every pledge, both personal and retail. \nRead Kurt's full review here.\nRead their full review here.\n Watch Daniel's full review here.\nRead Ambie's full review here.\nRead James' full coverage here.\nRead Steph's full review here. \nFull review coming shortly.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're not taking anything for granted here, but we have specifically chosen our lowest-risk project to begin with.

At the latest, fulfillment should begin by the 2nd-3rd week in November, with all pledges (both individual and retail) being sent out by the start of December. \n\nNow, the unforeseen is called that for a reason, so should anything threaten to lengthen this timeline, you will be the first to know.

And we're doing it the Public Goods way: that means premium quality products, available to you for what they cost us to make. By joining Public Goods, you'll be able to save money all year on our always expanding range of culinary delights plus our collection of premium home products, ranging from shampoo and body wash to linens and essential oils.\nLast year, we launched our personal care and household products on Kickstarter, and thousands of backers joined us. We've launched over 60 premium products (which are also available to all backers!) that have generated rave reviews from our members.\nWe\u2019ll carry a large selection of premium quality items, including a wide range of gluten free, organic, and vegan produce. We will introduce new products weekly, so you\u2019ll be sure to find some favourite new stuff as well as high quality everyday staples. Saving money has never been this tasty.\nOur mission is to make healthy high quality food affordable the same way we have with personal care and household goods: we cut out the middlemen and deliver healthy high-end products for the same price they cost us to make. We make money with a small annual membership fee instead of inflated prices.\nHealthy good food is actually not that expensive to make. It\u2019s the supply chain that\u2019s the problem \u2013  traditionally, a product goes through several price markups before it reaches you in a shop. We do things differently: by cutting out the middlemen and shipping directly to you, you can get premium products delivered to you door at a fraction of the price of traditional retail, saving you money every year. \nThrough this Kickstarter, we're offering lifetime memberships for a single, one time fee. Once the campaign ends, simply head to our website and choose which items you want from our line of natural products. (You\u2019ll also be able to access the Public Goods personal care and household products.) And in case you\u2019re wondering, we offer free US shipping for orders over $25.\nSaving money is just one aspect of the Public Goods concept \u2013 we\u2019re equally obsessed with bringing you the best quality products possible.

We know that there are thousands of games out there, and even more being developed and backed on Kickstarter as we speak (trust us, we've backed our fair share!). Before designing our modular inserts, most of our game piece storage included zip lock bags and rubber bands.  We love our game collections and want to make sure they are well-protected and look amazing when we bring them to game night. That's what inspired us to design our modular game box insert system.\nWe've sent our inserts to many different testers, and have been using them ourselves for a while. Now it's time to share the freedom to be able to protect and organize your games, regardless of size and components. \nPRODUCTS\nThe beauty of our product is that everything is modular, so you just purchase one of the base containers that fits in your particular game box and then select inserts that best organize the components of your games.  \nEach of our products are made from a high quality Baltic Birch plywood that both gives a high quality look and feel for the product, and ensures it will last for a very long time.\nWe will be offering 3 different-sized containers and 5 different types of inserts for the Kickstarter, with more inserts and container sizes to be released when our webstore goes live after fulfilment.\nDeck Inserts - We have 2 types of Deck Inserts that we are currently offering. The covers are included, but are optional. Their main function is to ensure that the cards will not get damaged if you move the game box around or if you store the games sideways. The inserts have also been designed to accommodate sleeved cards.\n*sleeved count is using penny sleeves\nToken Drawers - We have 3 types of Token Drawers that we are currently offering. These token drawers are offered as add-ons, but can also be used as stand alone products. If you have a game in a small box with only a few components, you can utilize the token drawers without the full box containers. \n *The Split Token Drawer is two shorter drawers stacked on top of each other for additional organizational utility, as shown in the picture below:\nYou can add additional inserts and token drawers to your pledge by upping the pledge amount for your selected level according to the cost of each additional insert you would like. See the Add-On section further down for pricing.\nAlong with the products being great for storage and organization, they also allow for some functionality when playing your games. We have a quick video that shows how you can utilize the products during your game play: \nKickstarter Pledge Levels\nFor our pledge levels, we have put together what we would consider \"starter bundles\".  In addition to each pledge level bundle, we are offering the Token Drawers, Deck Inserts and the Short Sand Bar, Sand Bar, and Sand Box  as add-ons.  Using these, in addition to the bundles, will provide you many ways to store, protect, and organize your games.\nSand Bar Bundle\nSand Box Bundle\nSand Castle Bundle\nSand Fortress Bundle \nADD-ONS\nTHERE WILL NOT BE A WAY TO ADD FUNDS FOR ADDITIONAL ADD-ONS ONCE THE CAMPAIGN IS OVER, SO MAKE SURE YOU ADD THE FUNDS FOR THE ADD-ONS YOU WANT WHILE THE PROJECT IS STILL LIVE.\nBelow are the products that can be add-ons to your pledge level bundles. Images of each of these items can be found above the pledge level descriptions prior to this section to help you gauge what you might need.\nSingle Deck Insert\nAdd $3.00 to any pledge level - Size:  H: 2\" x L: 4\" x W: 3\"\nSingle Split Deck Insert\nAdd $4.00 to any pledge level - Size: H: 2\" x L: 4\" x W: 3\"\nSingle Token Drawer\nAdd $4.00 to any pledge level - Size: H: 2\" x L: 4\" x W: 3\"\nSingle Split Token Drawer\nAdd $5.00 to any pledge level - Size: H: 2\" x L: 4\" x W: 3\"\nDouble Token Drawer\nAdd $6.00 to any pledge level - Size: H: 2\" x L: 4\" x W: 6\"\nDividers (2-pack)\nAdd $1.00 to any pledge level, These are the dividers that will fit in the Sand Bar line, NOT in the Sand Box.\nShort Sand Bar w/ dividers\nAdd $7.00 to any pledge level - Size: H: 2 1/8\" x L: 9 1/4\" W: 4 1/4, This will look the same as the Sand Bar, just shorter in length to accommodate different box sizes. It will not come with additional inserts.\nSand Bar w/ dividers\nAdd $8.00 to any pledge level - Size: H: 2 1/8\" x L: 11 1/4\" x W: 4 1/4\"\nSand Box w/ divider\nAdd $10.00 to any pledge level - Size: H: 2 1/8\" x L: 11 1/4\" x W: 6 1/4\"\nHere is an image showing the Sand Bar and Short Sand Bar side by side. The Short Sand Bar is the exact length to fit 3 inserts. \nOur product was made to work with hundreds of games. Below are some examples of how we have utilized them, but the possibilities are endless!  \nThe above games were organized using components you will receive in the Sand Castle Bundle. You will see that not all games will require the full amount of inserts you will be sent, so this will allow you to have additional inserts to use in other games as well.\nThe above games were organized using variations of the Sand Bar Bundle. You can see that for each of these games we used add-on items to complete the organization to our liking, but with the system we have designed, there are numerous ways to use your items to organize how you would like.\n*Note that Carcassonne was organized using the Short Sand Bar and Token Drawer. Both of these items are in the add-on section and do not come in any of the base pledges.\nThe above games were organized using what you will receive in the Sand Box Bundle and did not require any additional add-on pieces.\n*Note that in the Fallout picture we used 2 of the Token Drawers instead of the Double Token Drawer that you will receive in the Sand Box pledge level. This was due to the early photograph used for this game prior to us having decided to create the Double Token Drawer that is now being used.\nSHIPPING\nWe have decided to charge a flat rate of $7 for any pledge level being shipped within the United States. The international shipping rates will unfortunately be much higher and we are currently estimating $40. However, international shipping rates may apply. In addition, if the cost to ship to you internationally ends up being less than the $40 that was charged as part of the project we will reach out to you come time for shipping and inform you of any excess shipping funds that are in your favor and allow you to apply them towards any additional add-ons that you may want.\nAdditionally, there will be no extra shipping charges added for any add-ons that you choose to include in your pledge, unless you are only pledged at the $5 pledge level, in that instance we will be contacting you each individually after the campaign has ended in order to collect shipping costs. \nIf you choose to add a large number of add-ons to your pledge, the shipping may fall beyond the estimated ship date set for the wave you are a part of. If this may happen, we will reach out to you personally to let you know of any delays.\nFUTURE OF SAND BOX GAMING\nThank you for checking out our Kickstarter campaign. We hope you have a better idea of what we are doing as a company and that you are excited to contribute to our new adventure!  We have so many ideas for new inserts and designs, and if this campaign goes well, we are excited to continue to add to our line of products.   \nAll pictures in the campaign were taken using prototype versions of the products. As we continue to test the products and get feedback from our testers we may make small adjustments for ease of assembly and use.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis project comes with very few risks and challenges. The only limitation we foresee would be if we get a larger than estimated amount of backers. However, this is a problem we wouldn't mind having. We feel we have given sufficient time for us to fulfill orders and if we really do get a huge response we are confident we can up our production and resources to meet the demands.\n\nAnother risk would be if our laser machine goes out, which could cause our shipments to be delayed due to repairs. But, we have put some mitigation measures in place to help ensure we don't have this issue, or if it does occur for any reason, that the delay would be minimal as we are prepared for any minor fixes or repairs that may need to take place.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "That looks cool.", "descp": "Maybe you are not sure how much and what you will need?

Martin Wallace's design, originally set in a different universe, has been now translated into the realities of the myths and legends of the Victorian London. The same London which stood as inspiration for so many stories. Unavailable for more than 3 years now, the game returns in a new, stunning PHALANX quality edition.\nThe previous edition sold tens of thousands of copies and received fantastic feedback from the community:\nThe new artwork and premium components aren\u2019t the most important part of this project. Cardboard and plastic is worth nothing compared to the fun you get when you play the game. And this game brings you this most important thing: an hour of fantastic gaming experience for your family and friends.\nBut why we should stop here? Let\u2019s improve this experience, let\u2019s start playing NOW! This won\u2019t be a standard Kickstarter campaign. It will be a true story-driven campaign! To reveal the goals you need to solve the mystery puzzle:\nSo, please sit back, watch the trailer, and follow the first campaign update to read the Prologue of our story. Become a Nanty Narking backer now and take an important part in the investigation!\nWhat's in the box \nWhy Back Now?\nBack Nanty Narking now to:\nSave 25% off the suggested retail price (\u00a380).\nGet a free deluxe set of 50 metal coins (20 crowns, 30 shillings, all designed basing on the real Victorian era ones), worth \u00a320.00 in retail.\nGet 3 new game variants, unavailable in the previous version.\nReceive the game before it hits retail distribution.\nHelp an independent publisher design, develop, and publish unique, challenging games.\nUnlock the new components and improve the recent game components while being involved in the ongoing investigation.\nGame Overview\nNanty Narking is a Victorian board game of wit and podsnappery that reintroduces the well-known bestseller of Martin Wallace. Immersed deeply in the world of Dickens's and Doyle's literature, the card events in the game are now tied to real and fictional characters and places in London. More specifically, following a scrupulous analysis of inspirations that were found and identified in historical English literature, all game locations, events, and characters have received new identities corresponding to the ones found in the previous edition of the game. This way the game retains its attractiveness to the established audience, but expands its reach to a wide range of people generally interested in history and literature of the Victorian period.\nThe action takes place on the map of London, with players placing their followers and buildings on the board through card play. Each of the 132 cards is unique, and \"the cards bring the game to life as they include most of the famous characters that have appeared in the various books. The rules are relatively simple: Play a card and do what it says. Most cards have more than one action on them, and you can choose to do some or all of these actions. Some cards also allow you to play a second card, so you can chain actions\" (Martin Wallace). At the beginning of the game, each player draws a secret personality with specific victory conditions, which means that you can never be sure what the other players need to do in order to win. You need to fulfill your goal while also trying to prevent others from winning!\nSimple game rules and deep, immersive gameplay are the backbone of this title\u2019s success. Please check the Previews and Reviews sections on the campaign page (just scroll down) to get the idea of what people think about the game.\nAnd if you want to see how does the gameplay look, please check out this video:\nOur Goal and Story Goals\nThis campaign is not something that you are used to seeing on Kickstarter. The game design is complete and has been playtested by more than 60.000 players, with a great 7.2 rating on BoardGameGeek.com! So, there will be no rule-changing expansions and stretch goals.\nThe game will be published if we reach the funding goal of \u00a360,000. And then we will start our journey through Victorian London to solve the mystery of Lenore\u2019s death, playing a gamebook written by Miko\u0142aj Ko\u0142yszko. What lies ahead on this path? What upgrades and additional components will you collect for the game box? With this first story-based Kickstarter campaign everything is in your hands.\nAll reached story goals are added to every game for free, except the add-ons, which need to be purchased separately.\nNanty Narking Artbook\nAll backers with their backer number no higher than #2200 will receive a free copy of Nanty Narking - Stories in an imaginary world - an artbook (full colour, A5 size, 4+48 pages [250-170g coated chalk paper], UV varnish, English edition) by Waldemar Gumienny, showing the connections between the game and Victorian themed literature. This book was available for free during the first 48 hours of this campaign for all who get the Round World Pledge. This item is also available as an add-on - please scroll down this page for add-ons section.\nWhat is more, thanks to revealed story goals, the Artbook add-on will be enlarged by additional pages dedicated for the gamebook story you have been shaping during this campaign. The story, written by Miko\u0142aj Ko\u0142yszko, will be a background intro that will allow you to emerge into the game itself. It will introduce the most important figures and places you will encounter in the game.\nNo Game-Related Kickstarter Exclusives\nWe are players at heart, so we are against Kickstarter exclusives. In this campaign you will find no game-related Kickstarter exclusives. But the deluxe Victorian coins set that you receive for free when backing the Round World Pledge during this campaign will not be free afterwards. This set will be available at retail distribution for \u00a320.00, and limited in production.\nPlease note, however, that Nanty Narking - Stories in an imaginary world is a Kickstarter exclusive for this campaign.\nReviews\nVideo Previews\nWritten Previews\nPolyhedroncollider.com, Sep 2018. Nanty Narking is a brilliant game, something that carefully balances direct player conflict and area control without relying on heavy randomness and this new version is beauty to behold.\nTabletoptogether.com, Sep 2018. From the looks of the components and the huge box you would expect this to be the main event of your typical game night. But the truth is, the game is has a rather simple ruleset and plays fast. This actually surprised me and in a good way.\nNerdly.co.uk, Aug 2018. As someone who never played the original, Nanty Narking occupies a unique spot in my collection. There are relatively few games that feature such interaction, such one-upmanship and such a simple set of rules. I won\u2019t lie, I also love the new artwork. Yes, dark, heavy oil is a big departure from the comical, cartoon style of thepredecessor, but that might be a deliberate juxtaposition and in any case, it fits Nanty Narking\u2018s theme well.\nReviews of the previous edition\nHarvey O'Brien, Sep 2011. I was a little skeptical but also intrigued when I first heard about this and I preordered it when I could. Martin Wallace hasn't let me down. Though the game is quick and fairly light and has some randomness, there are still meaningful choices to be made in the manner of most Wallace games, and you're not going to find it as straightforward as it seems. Played quickly and with a sense of fun, this is a very worthwhile and entertaining addition to any game table.\nNeil Thomson, Mar 2014. It is a fantastic game from the stripped-back mechanics and player interaction aspects through to the care to honour the world it is drawn from and the wonderful production values. For those that think Wallace went too light with this design compared to his tight scoring and meaty designs of the past I call foul. I think this is a deeper game than it is given credit for, it's just not the same kind of deep that relies on heavy mechanics, multiple scoring options and a bundle of components. If you have never heard of the universe do not fear, this will not result in a poor experience one bit. In fact a much larger factor in your enjoyment will boil down to your like or dislike of 'take that', 'bash the leader' and area control games.\nRPG.net, Dec 2011. This is is a very different sort of game for Martin Wallace. It's more of an American design, full of randomness and confrontation, with some touches of elegant Euro design. Fans of American games should find it a well-polished and well-themed entertainment. Fans of Euro games will need to be comfortable with the random elements, but if so will enjoy a fun game.\nThe Opinionated Gamers, Mar 2012. For me, the game is light, devious fun. Don\u2019t\u2019 take it too seriously and accept it for what it is. It seems to accomplish exactly what it is designed to do \u2013 provide players with a light and fun game that is filled with power grabs, smack-downs and unexpected twists of fortune.\nGame Rules\nHere you can find videos with rules:\nAnd if you prefer to read them, please click here to download the PDF Beta version of the game rules:\nPlay the Game\nHere is a link to the Tabletopia game room for Nanty Narking:\nAdd-Ons\nWe are offering a number of items that you can add to your pledge. To include add-ons in your pledge, please click on the Manage Your Pledge button (do not cancel your pledge!). To include any items you would like to receive, simply increase your total pledge for the amount of the add-ons. For example - if you want to add Canvas Mat to your pledge, please click Manage Your Pledge button and increase your pledge from \u00a360 to \u00a395. You will be able to let us know in the Pledge Manager (after the campaign ends) which items you have added to your order.\nCampaign add-ons\nOther game add-ons\nThe estimated shipping cost of the Canvas Mat, Hannibal & Hamilcar and The Magnates is +\u00a38-\u00a310 per item; Germania Magna, Days of Honour, and HUNGER is +\u00a35 per game. Extra set of Victorian Coins, Artbook and Wooden Card Holders do not affect your shipping cost.\nYou need to purchase at least one copy of Nanty Narking to be able to include any add-ons in your pledge.\nOngoing Pre-order\nYou can still take part in pre-order of our previous Kickstarter: U-BOOT The Board Game and save \u00a315 on this innovative game.\nProduction and Delivery\nPlease note that the graphic materials presented here are not yet final and may be changed. The photos are of handmade prototypes of the game. The final production quality will be much, much higher.\nPrototype game components.\nThe games are produced in the EU (with miniatures produced in China), in keeping with the proven high standards of PHALANX. If you back us on Kickstarter, you will receive your copy several weeks before the game reaches any retail outlets! Our goal is to produce Nanty Narking within 200 days of reaching our funding goal. Kickstarter backers will have their copies delivered no later than October 2019.\nShipping\nYou will be asked to pay the shipping cost in the Pledge Manager after the campaign. At that time, you will be able to add extra copies of the game and items from our add-on list. Additional items may increase shipping costs. PHALANX is responsible for shipping the English and Polish editions of the game. The games will be shipped out from USA, EU, Canada and Australia. The estimated shipping cost is: USA \u00a315 to most states, \u00a330 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Canada \u00a320. EU \u00a310-12 to most countries (Poland - free). Other European countries \u00a315 - \u00a330. Asia \u00a330, Australia \u00a330, New Zealand \u00a335, Oceania \u00a345, Latin America \u00a345, Africa \u00a345.\nYou can multiply the Round World Pledge to get significant savings on shipping costs. For example: the cost of shipping to most EU countries will be \u00a310-12 for a single game and \u00a315 for 2-4 games, if shipped to the same address. Call your friends and save around \u00a325 on shipping!\nInternational Distribution\nIf you're a retailer from the EU, please contact us at sales[at]vertima.trade to receive an offer.

We are sure that you won\u2019t regret it, as our previous projects have received great feedback from the community.

The Plague Doctors are posing as Villagers too, so who do you trust? Exile a new player each day, but beware, as new infections plague your village each night. \n The variable player powers and roles gives an enormous amount of depth, tension, player interaction, and replayability, with new character roles you haven't seen before. \nThe majority of players will be on the Villager team. Presumably, players try to eliminate someone from the Plague Doctor side during the day. This is the crux of the game, as the Plague Doctor side tries to hide and blend in with the Villager team without being too suspicious in their actions. \nThere are 2 phases to the game: Day, and Night. \nAt night, certain players will secretly perform actions (such as checking on, infecting, or protecting other players) under the guidance of the Moderator.\nDuring the day, Villagers will try to identify members of the Plague Doctor team.\nThe Villagers will win by eliminating the Plague Doctors, or the Plague Doctor side will win by eliminating the Villagers.\nThe Villagers is full of unique roles which will counter each other so that the level of interaction between players is higher than in any other game of its kind.\nCheck out this video preview by Man vs Meeple: \n \"This is where all the lying, bluffing, and deceit comes out.\" - Man vs Meeple \n A close look at The Villagers by Tantrum House:\nThe Villagers preview, by Brian's Got Game:\nPlaying The Villagers, by The Games Room: \n  What are some of these special roles?

Dice colors for spectrum sets will be randomly selected, but you will be getting a dice in every color of that spectrum! For example: Let's say you purchase the primary spectrum: you may receive a red d4, orange d6, yellow d8, green d10, blue d12, purple d20, and pink d100.

It is a mechanical lock artifact with a secret chamber inside.\nWe are introducing a redesigned and engineered version of this artifact. A beautiful and affordable product with endless possibilities. We are proud to share we issued a patent of our design, it is now patent pending. \nMXN $460  \u2248  USD $24 \nCreate, design and solve enigmas, riddles and cryptograms.\nHide secret messages, store your most valuable items, make surprises, create challenging adventures. \n  Watch the story of this young adventurer on his way to find the treasure...\nBeautifully wood-crafted using CNC technology with details and finishes by hand.\nSix digits, one password. Six decagonal rings with engraved numbers on the surface. 1,000,000 possible combinations. Smooth ratchet mechanisms inside each ring.   \nInspired on DaVinci's inventions. DaVinci must be proud!\nInside...\nA secret chamber with 26.5cm3 (1.616 in3) of volume capacity. Here you can store anything you want!\n  It only opens when you put the right combination.\nThe Cryptex is completely developed and it is ready to be manufactured. It took us several months to develop it as a product and make each little detail perfect. The mechanism, the material, its resistance and durability, how pieces join together, its shape and weight. It was carefully designed and engineered to ensure the best user experience for all ages.\nAchievement unlocked - Customize it!\nWe'll let you decide what to engrave in this area of your Cryptex!\nCheck the new design from the image below\nWe know how customized things are way more unique and full of meaning for each of us. This is why we'll be able to customize it with your own personal touch to make it perfect for you.\nNew design\nWe are featuring the DaVinci's phrase we love. This phrase to continues to inspire us to innovate and create things differently. A meaningful phrase simulating DaVinci's hand-written Italian.   \nCi sono tre tipi di persone: quelli che vedono, quelli che vedono quando viene mostrato, e quelli che non lo vedono.\n\"There are three classes of people: those who see, those who see when they are shown and those who do not see.\"\nAfter campaign, you tell us what is the phrase you want. We'll send you a survey. For those of you who don't know what phrase to choose or simply don't want to customize it, we will engrave the official web address of the Cryptex (no decided yet, but tentatively would be cryptex.guizarbrothers.com).

Through the ancient Chinese art of herbalism, you\u2019ll test ingredients, use logic to deduce the cure, and become the greatest Herbalist in the country!\nDesigned by: Eros Lin and Liu Xaio Art by: Stephen Tsai  \nAt Deep Water Games, we have partnered with publishing powerhouse EmperorS4 to bring the US versions of their games to America. We're debuting our company and partnership on Kickstarter with the brand new, North American versions of Herbalism and three other excellent ES4 titles.\n  Every game of Herbalism is played with a deck of 14 cards that contains 4 ingredients of varying frequency. Every round, two of those 14 cards will be set aside randomly. Those are the ingredients that will cure the epidemic.\nPlayers take turns choosing combinations and taking actions to exchange hidden information until they can solve what two ingredients are missing from the deck. Each action consists of two parts: what a player gives to another player and what that player gives in return.\nPlayers will exchange information this way until a player thinks they know which two ingredients are missing. Then they can take the Cure Action and choose the formula they think is the correct one. Other players have the chance to make their own guesses or follow this player!\nIf the player making the guess is correct, they score 3 points and anyone who followed them scores 1 point. But players should choose wisely because incorrect predictions and following the wrong answer will earn a player negative points! The first player to gain 7 points is declared the best Herbalist, and claims the ancient honor of \u201cGodfarmer.\u201d \n\n                        Click for the full article\n    Click for the full article\n                 This Kickstarter includes free shipping all over the US and reduced shipping for the pledge tiers everywhere else in North America.\nCanada: $10 For the base pledge and $15 for the founders pack!\nAnywhere else: $15 For the base pledge and $20 for the founders pack!\n\nIf you include add-ons we'll cover any additional shipping costs for you! \n Follow us on Social Media!\n                                        \u2022 Fantastic Gameplay \u2013 This game is highly interactive, puzzling, and leaves players wanting more.\n\u2022 Elegant Design and Beautiful Art \u2013 The art is captivating and the design of the game is great!  \n\u2022 Free USA shipping! \u2013 And reduced shipping to the rest of North America.\n\u2022 Bundles! \u2013 Big discount on all 4 of our launch games.\n\u2022 Support goes a long way! \u2013 Deep Water Games is just getting started.

Your characters will grow and progress through a series of stories in their quest to rid the land of evil. Every story is broken into chapters, allowing players to control the length of each game session. Most chapters take approximately 45-60 minutes to complete, and almost assuredly spell doom for you would-be heroes.\nThe second edition of the Folklore: The Affliction contains cardboard standees instead of plastic miniatures in the core boxes. The 77 miniatures (in 45 unique sculpts) from the world of Folklore are available packaged separately. Already own the core game, but ready to delve deeper into the darkness? The \u201cMinstrel\u201d pledge level contains seven full-length stories, the Adventure Creation Kit for crafting your own tales, and a Kickstarter exclusive embossed metal coin with inlaid color. Scroll down for more details!\nThe Folklore Community:\nThis Kickstarter\u2019s goal is to build a larger community around this game. To help accomplish this, we\u2019ve separated the plastic miniatures into their own box, allowing us to make the core Folklore experience more widely available at a lower price point.  As the community grows, you guys, the vanguard of this realm, will have opportunities to shape the future of Kremel with story creation contests and community votes for branching story paths. \nThe biggest thing you can do to help make this happen is participate on the Folklore page of boardgamegeek.com, and share this campaign on social media.

Check the updates for new previews!\nDuring its original campaign in 2015, Folklore: The Affliction unlocked a lengthy list of SGs, which we spent the better part of a year and half developing. Our goal for this campaign is to bring the adventure to a greater audience here on Kickstarter, and then to retail. With this in mind, we will focus on social stretch goals to help spread the word about Folklore. All stretch goals will be meant to enhance the game as it stands, while having minimal development time so as not to delay the estimated delivery date. \n All pledge levels now include a Folklore: The Affliction cloth dice bag.\n A pack of updates for returning backers, including a revised rulebook, errata cards, and reprinted character booklets for The Dark Tales expansion.

Each chapter is meant to be played in between the main stories featured in Folklore: The Affliction, and will end in a choose-your-path moment. We'll be asking members of the community to vote for which path their group chose - and the most popular choice will become cannon, shaping the the step chapter and the world of Folklore. Chapters will be released on a monthly basis.\nWe are now able to develop dial-based trackers to replace those found in the core game. The design features dials on top and bottom to track the  vita and power points of your character. Even more exciting, the trackers are double sided, and can be flipped over to track up to two creatures in an encounter, instead of one character. Packs of 5 trackers will be included in the Farmer and Mystic pledge level for free, and sets of 5 will also be available to add-on to any pledge for $5.\nThe Esoteric Order of Gamers will now be creating a comprehensive rules summary, play-through videos, live streams, and other supporting content for the Folklore: The Affliction community.\nThanks to the votes and support of the community, the Dark Tales expansion has been upgraded to include the Demons & Dark Artifacts bonus pack, which includes the Heirlooms deck, the Artifacts deck, and the Shadow Lord - a cross over affliction from the Midara franchise. Backers who already own the Dark Tales expansion and would like to obtain the Demons & Dark Artifacts pack should email us at greenbriergames@gmail.com.\n  With 12 successful Kickstarters under our belt, we have learned a lot about what it takes to get our games into your hands. One of the biggest things is how variable the cost of shipping can be. As such, we will be charging shipping after this Kickstarter concludes, according to the actual costs incurred to ship to your area. We will do this through our own Pledge Manager system once this Kickstarter has concluded.  \nThere are two reasons we do this. First, it allows us to provide a lower rate on the actual pledge levels and structure a much tighter budget for the campaign and stretch goals since we do not have to estimate for shipping costs. Second, the funds raised for the project are 100% for the actual project itself rather than being partially inflated by shipping costs that may not be accurate.Though the pricing may vary due to any add-ons you pledge for by the end of the campaign, these are our closest estimates for shipping, based on region.\nFor the Townsman level:\nUSA: Average of $15 to most states. \nCANADA: Average of $18 to most cities. \nEUROPE: Average of $25 to most countries. \nOCEANIA: Average of $20 to Australia. Average of $30 to New Zealand. \nRest of World: Average of $80 to most countries\nFor the Minstrel/Farmer pledge level:\nUSA: Average of $6 to most states ($10 for Farmer). \nCANADA: Average of $8 to most cities ($12 for Farmer). \nEUROPE: Average of $12 to most countries ($16 for Farmer). \nOCEANIA: Average of $12 to Australia. Average of $20 to New Zealand ($16-25 for Farmer).\nRest of World: Average of $35 to most countries ($40 for Farmer).\nFor the Mystic pledge level:  \nUSA: Average of $20 to most states.  \nCANADA: Average of $23 to most cities. \nEUROPE: Average of $30 to most countries.   \nOCEANIA: Average of $25 to Australia. Average of $35 to New Zealand. Rest of World: Average of $95 to most countries\nUnfortunately, import laws and customs have made it impossible for us to ship to Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nNote that the above prices are all import/customs friendly, except for \u201cWorld.\u201d These numbers are based on regional averages, and are subject to change.\nGreenbrier Games has teamed up with Twin Fire Productions to produce this amazing game. We are very excited about Folklore and we are enjoying working with Twin Fire Productions on this adventure!\nThere are many people that have embarked together on this quest to aide in the development of Folklore:The Affliction. Here are a few:\nEd Greenwood! In between game sessions you can continue your adventures in Folklore: The Affliction by reading the novels from Ed Greenwood and other works by members of The Ed Greenwood Group's Sessorium of Creatives.

Most players will step into the shoes of LAPD Homicide detectives that will do whatever it takes to solve the case, but one player will take on the role of The Chisel whose goal is to stall and misdirect the detectives at every turn. \nInspired by classic film noir like The Big Sleep, the works of James Ellroy (L.A. Confidential), and the video game L.A. Noire from Rockstar Games, Detective: City of Angels is a mystery and crime solving game unlike any other. \n    4 unique sculpts are included in the game. Prototype sculpts shown here.\n  Detective: City of Angels is a VRG Select title. This means that it will not be sold through normal retail channels. It will be available at the best price to backers of this Kickstarter campaign, for preorder/late pledge at a higher price through our pledge manager, and eventually through our website, at conventions, and/or through other direct partners. For more information see Update #9 here.\n          Each case is beautifully illustrated by renowned artist Vincent Dutrait, creating a rich and gritty noire atmosphere.\n  Detectives will explore every shadowy corner of the City of Angels, rendered in gorgeous and authentic detail on a massive 33x21 inch game board. The game board is based on an amazing public domain map created in 1932 by K. M. Leuschner, which Vincent has lovingly updated and adorned with his own touches.\n     Click here to download the rulebook for Detective: City of Angels. This is the rulebook that was sent to reviewers and uses prototype components and art. It is NOT the final version! \nWith 9 cases included and the option to play competitively, cooperatively (see below), or even solo (see below), Detective: City of Angels will provide hours of mystery-solving gaming.\nPlus, go all in for the Hardboiled Pledge level and get Bullets Over Hollywood, the first expansion which includes four additional cases, putting even more noir goodness on your table!\n      While we highly recommend the game be played competitively, the versatility of Detective: City of Angels is such that it can also be played cooperatively against \"The Chisel\" or Cooperatively/Solitaire with no Chisel player. \nPlaying cooperatively against the Chisel removes the \"corruption\" elements and the detectives become a team working together to solve the case. There is still competition with the Chisel though. \nAlternatively, this KS will come with a 64-page Solo/Cooperative case book and case grid cards that allows the game to be played without a Chisel player as the book will simulate the play of the Chisel. In particular, playing the game solo is a great way to prepare for your first game as The Chisel! \nDesign of solitaire case cards and solitaire paragraph book is not final.\nIn each of these modes of play the ARC system is in the spotlight and the competitive elements of the game, like scratch and bribe actions, are removed. The focus is primarily on solving the case and immersing yourself in the role of a detective.\nAn important question with scenario-based mystery solving games such as Detective: City of Angels is: how replayable is the game? \nWhile detective players will not be able to experience a given case again as a detective (since they'll already know the solution), anyone can play the same case multiple times as The Chisel. In fact, it even benefits The Chisel to have played a case more than once! The Chisel will understand how the mystery works and have a better grasp of how to mislead and delay the detectives during their investigation. \nIn fact, a case can unfold VERY differently depending on how the detectives pursue their investigations, always forcing The Chisel to stay on his or her toes even if it's a case he or she's already played.\nDetective player boards\n  Rahdo Runs Through\nThe below video has Richard \"Rahdo\" Ham's final thoughts on the game.

We endeavor to ship as inexpensively as possible while still being able to cover costs and get the games safely to you!\n  From Vincent Dutrait, the amazingly talented artist behind Detective: City of Angels: \n\"Detective is an epic journey! Because of the huge narrative aspect of the game, it's a real challenge to bring to life all the iconic characters and well-know places. I've never worked on a game with a \"film noir\" atmosphere before, and I did a lot a research to find precise documents and great references, all in support of helping the players immerse themselves deeply in the game and the city of Los Angeles in the 1940s. Another tricky challenge was to get the right tone and to capture the right mood! Working with Evan and the Van Ryder team has been incredibly rewarding as we worked so hard to share and convey our points of view with the players. We wanted to give them the chance to live out the stories and everyday life of Detectives & Mob characters.\"\n\"Technically, I really enjoy to working on 'fake' illustrations, imitating textures, objects, colors and lights of past periods, which is a unique opportunity. I also enjoy bringing the characters to life, giving them authenticity, truth and credibility! Furthermore, Detective is a fascinating project because of all the different component sizes and elements: I have to develop precise and accurate solutions for building the box, cards, boards and tokens in order to get the most cohesive ensemble!\"\nMiniatures\nWe would like to thank James Van Schaik for his incredible sculpting work on the miniature in Detective. Thanks to him, each player will have his or her own miniature to move around the City of Angels!\nJames has worked on many top grossing kickstarters including Gloomhaven, Defense Grid, Myth, Mercs, Relic Knights, Dreadball, and many more. As a sculptor, he has worked with Ral Partha, WizKids, Wyrd Miniatures, Games Workshop, Mantic, Megacon Games, Ninja Division, Soda Pop Miniatures, Pulp City, Battlefront, Gale Force 9, Dust Tactics, Reaper, Gloomhaven, and Lynnvander.\nSee the many projects he has developed here on Artstation. Additionally you can find him on Facebook or visit his portfolio on Flickr. \nGame does not come with painted miniatures.

These terrain sets represent the culmination of over twelve years of gaming terrain design experience.\nFat Dragon Games is the only 3D printer terrain company that is part of the prestigious DriveThruRPG Community Content program, which includes Margaret Weis Productions, Monte Cook Games, and Wizards of the Coast\u2019s DMs Guild. Our Dragonbite Community Creator program allows YOU to sell your own Dragonbite-compatible terrain designs on DriveThruRPG, RPGNow, and Wargame Vault!\nBy supporting us through Kickstarter, you get bonus models that won't be available later, and access to free stretch rewards. We have been in the 'print-and-play' terrain business for over twelve years, and have successfully delivered eight previous Kickstarter projects, so you can pledge with confidence that we will deliver a high-quality product on time.\nFREE STRETCH REWARDS that will increase the size of the terrain offerings will be available to anyone pledging at the 'Realm of the Mountain King' pledge level or higher. Spread the word about this project to your friends and post about it on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, etc., and GET FREE BONUS MODELS as the pledges rise!\nA standard dungeon wall piece costs around $0.40 in plastic to print yourself, far cheaper than factory-made terrain! All of the models shown were printed at 100-200 micron resolution, a common standard on most economical 3D printers. A nice starter printer that can print these files starts around $220 (see our F.A.Q. for more info on printers, printing costs, filaments, and more.)\nEven if you don't currently own a 3D printer, it benefits you to support this campaign now. You can get all of the free stretch rewards, exclusive content in some sets not available later, and have a digital library of village terrain ready to go when you do purchase a printer.\nSPECIAL THANKS TO REAPER MINIATURES for allowing us to use their miniatures in our photos and video!

One or two poorly selling sets could hurt our company severely. By putting potential projects up on Kickstarter, we can be sure if there is demand for that subject before devoting our resources to it. We also get to connect directly with our customers, rewarding those who are early supporters for a set with cool stuff like exclusive pieces not available to customers who purchase the set later on, and free stretch rewards. We have been in the print-and-play terrain business for over 12 years, having released over 180 terrain sets, and have had eight previous Kickstarter campaigns successfully funded and delivered, so supporters of this project can feel completely confident in our ability to deliver a high-quality product as promised.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "I just need the add-ons", "descp": "Pledge here if you only want add-on sets, and pledge the total amount for all of the sets you want.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2018"}], "stat": ["122 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Wilderness Encounters", "descp": "A wilderness scenery pack including a full campsite with tents, shelters, three stages of campfires, owlbear miniatures, and more.\nINCLUDES:\nWilderness Encounters Terrain Set", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2017"}], "stat": ["19 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "Mountain Adventures", "descp": "The ultimate cliff and elevated terrain set!

The challenge of this project was to come up with a design that felt similar to Dice of Crowns, but introduced new elements to keep it fresh. The feel of Crowns was all about intrigue and backstabbing. Pirates are not subtle, so the design went for direct action and attacking.\nCorsair Darrin Michelson is a graphic designer and illustrator who has worked on everything from games to gravestones. He enjoys working himself to death, anything involving the words 'Inception' and 'The Prestige', and dogs seem to think he's okay. \nSwab Sean Epperson has been design support for this project. He's an avid gamer all his life, working on numerous video games and helping to develop the very popular Dice of Crowns. When not designing and developing games, he's playing them, or talking about them on the Board Game Alliance audio podcast on BJ's Geek Nation podcast network. We've tried to get him help, but he just gamed the system.

They were the manufacturer for the original Dice of Crowns game.They have great service and quality.\n\nThe biggest challenge that we see for this project is the unknown of backer fulfillment. To minimize that risk we are partnering with fulfillment companies in AU, CA, and the UK.\n\nWe are consistently monitoring the project and working hard to remove as much risk as we can.\n\nIf you have any questions about the project development please ask us.

For us, it had been too long.  So my wife and I started writing down random questions every day. They were little things we didn't know about each other. We put them in a box, pulled one out every night and discovered something new about each other with a completely fresh conversation.  Uncommon Questions is our collection of questions that you can use to reconnect daily with your loved one.\nUncommon Questions is a set of 200 conversation starters for couples. Each card will help you learn something new about your partner. Each question was designed to be fun, non-confrontational, and not-very-serious. We are 99.99999% sure you've never had these conversations. And if you have, pat yourself on the back, you are weird. This isn't marriage therapy, you won't talk about your feelings, you'll just have a quick chance to reconnect and re-appreciate your partner by learning a new random fact about them.\nWe made Uncommon Questions because our relationship needed some help. As parents of young kids, my wife and I realized with the exhaustion we were facing on a daily basis, we had stopped discovering new things about each other. Our conversations were mostly the same every day: money, schedules, family stuff and what to watch on Netflix.\nThe questions are quick, insightful and fun.  Some conversations might last a minute, some might last 20 minutes.  The outcome will be the same, you'll find something new to appreciate about your partner.  \nThe topics you'll discuss are very random, and this keeps things fresh!  You might answer questions about your favorite toy growing up, your favorite urban legend, what you'd do with the ability to time travel or what you'd train a domestic robot to do.  All these little random discoveries add up!\n  You can use the cards however you want to.  For us, we pick out one card to talk about every night right after the kids go down.  Some of our friends have pulled out the deck and answered a bunch of cards in a single sitting. Do what works best for you!\nThere is no scoring system, but if you must be competitive in every facet of life, make one up. How about you try to guess your partners answer, or predict a word they are going to use in their answer. If you lose, you have to do something. There, now you have your arbitrary point system.\n    We have tested the game out with newlyweds, people dating, empty-nesters, DINK's, married couples, teenage couples and retirees, we found that the conversations worked great for everyone.\nUncommon Questions was designed to be gender and orientation inclusive.  We hope everyone can enjoy it!\nYou get a sleek box that holds 200 professionally printed cards with our conversation starters.\nYou'll also receive 16 blank cards for you to come up with your own questions!\nThe cards are standard Poker size. \nIf we meet our stretch goals we'll have expansion packs printed for you to add to your box!\n  Our goal is to ship in early January 2018.  We have the designs submitted and approved by a printer.  If we have a larger response and meet our funding goal early, we'd love to get printing right early!\nIf you are outside the US and interested in our project, reach out.  We'll figure out shipping!\nOur first stretch goal is $10,000!  If we raise $10,000 we'll add an additional 18 cards to the deck, bringing the total to 234 cards!

Each one will provide a unique experience, pushing the survival skills of both novice and veteran explorers to the limit.\nThis new expansion has its own \u201ccollector\u2019s\u201d box that \u2013 combined with the base box \u2013 can store all of the cards of the base box as well as all of the expansions (even if everything is sleeved) and other materials.

When you wish to take off again, simply make your way back to the card where you landed and your aerial adventure continues.\nTake care though, as each trip will tax you. Hunger, confinement and violent winds will test your nerves.\nMake short trips and improve your piloting abilities if you want to stand a chance of lifting the curse that keeps you trapped in this hopeless land.\n\u201cThe Veins of the Earth\u201d will drag you down into the bowels of the earth where an underground network of serpentine waterways spans the entire length of the continent.\nAboard a barge of aboriginal design, your actions will be limited as the current draws you ever deeper.

A renowned explorer, you have just returned from the first expedition on the seventh continent, a mysterious land that was recently discovered off the coast of Antarctica and is very likely the last Terra Incognita in the world.\nYou are recovering from your adventure when, whilst reading the daily newspaper, you realize that several other members of the expedition have disappeared suddenly, for unknown reasons.\nCoincidentally, you have been lethargic for a few days, feeling feverish and finding it difficult to get out of bed. A cold shiver runs down your spine and you are in a constant state of depression and malaise.\nYou are going to have to face the facts: an evil is consuming you from within. When night falls, you slip into a restless sleep unaware that, for you, this is only the beginning...\nYou start each new game by choosing one of the available characters. Each one comes with their own set of Skill cards that represent their abilities and personality (adventurer, herbalist, doctor, mercenary, etc.).\nKeelan: an explorer and keen Botanist. One of the explorers available to you with an example of her Skill cards.\n\u201cThe Voracious Goddess\u201d, \u201cAn Offering to The Guardians\u201d, \u201cThe Bloody Hunt\u201d, \"The Dark Chest of the Damned\" - Choose which curse (or curses!) has been put on you from those included in the base box (4) or those in the expansions (5).\nYour goal? Find out how to lift the curses you have chosen and then purge your soul of them. Each curse offers a very unique adventure and will take you to different places. Obtain the unobtainable, discover that which is forever hidden, and strive against the impossible.\nDo you have what it takes?\nA Curse that you can attempt to lift and its clue.\nYou are now ready to begin your unexpected adventure. Similar to the books where \"you are the hero\u201d, you will explore the continent by putting numbered Terrain and Permanent event cards into play, which will gradually form the game board.\nForests, deserts, caves and mountains - you will visit dozens of different locations during your adventures as well as encounter random events that coincide with your location.\nTo progress through the game, you will perform the actions available on the Terrain card your miniature is standing on, the Event cards attached to it, and the Character, Skill, State and Bonus cards in your hand and the Items in your inventory.\nIn order to perform these actions, you will use the Action Deck that contains your Skills and simultaneously serves as your life force.\nEvery action makes you draw a certain number of cards from the Action Deck. These cards provide a variable amount of successes and you must obtain a specified number of them in order to succeed.\nFight action: draw 2 or more cards from the Action Deck to perform the action. Get 1 or more achievements to succeed.\nFailing when performing an action may have terrible consequences and cause you to get negative State cards, forcing you to discard cards from the Action Deck, and consequently reducing your life force.\nFall off this peak and you will likely get injured.\nWant to stack the odds in your favour? You may choose to draw more cards from the Action Deck to get more successes. However, every card in the Action Deck is a bit of your life force, so when the Action Deck is exhausted, so are you. From now on, every action could be your last!\nThankfully, the Skill cards that you may add to your hand when performing actions, your Bonus and Item cards, and the help from your companions will make things easier for you. This is especially true when it comes to decreasing the number of cards you must draw to perform an action or by increasing your chances of success.\nA faithful companion and a precious item.\nThe 7th Continent is a strange land with many paranormal events, hostile creatures and inhospitable locations.\nYou will have to use your best survival skills to overcome the varied threats you will face in this land, so that you can eventually lift your curses:\nFind or craft items to help you escape risky situations or access locations that would normally be unreachable without them.\nGather food, by hunting or fishing, in order to regain some life force, returning Action cards from the discard pile to your Action deck. Make a fire and cook it and you\u2019ll find that you\u2019ll get even more cards back!\nLook carefully at your environment. It contains many clues and hidden numbers that can help you uncover the Continent\u2019s many secret locations.\nThere are countless surprises for you to experience along your journey!\nA page from your journal that now allows you to use this plant when you see it on your Terrain card.\nYou can download the rules (.pdf \u2013 56 Mo) or check this video (26\u2019) to learn how to play The 7th Continent!\n\nEdit: cards from The Past must be returned between two game sessions.\nAll the expansions and optional purchases from the original Kickstarter will be available during the course of the second campaign.\nHow to add optional buys to my pledge?\n1.

Without them, we wouldn\u2019t be here today.\nThe cost of making this game is high, notably due to the quality of its components. Due to this a retail version of the game is almost unfeasible.\nHowever, we want the game to live and continue growing as well as allowing those that missed out on the first campaign and/or some of its contents to acquire them.\nThis campaign is no doubt one of your last chances to take part in The 7th Continent adventure...\nThis new campaign will allow you to expand upon the adventure we all began back in 2015. With new curses and mechanics, a whole new experience awaits you! It will also allow you to acquire any elements you may have missed from the first campaign.\nFor those of you only interested by the \u201cupgrade pack\u201d: you will be able to procure it (at production cost) at our online store at www.seriouspoulp.com when it becomes available in 2018.\nFree Upgrade pack\nThis pack contains cards that will allow those of you possessing the first edition of the game to upgrade it to the second edition and 4 additional dividers to help you search for cards more easily (Characters' Skills, \"004\", \"051\", \"109\"). It includes any cards that may have been changed or corrected after the first campaign.\nNOTE: This pack is included in the Veteran pledge (which is specifically for those with a copy of The 7th Continent from the first Kickstarter campaign)\nNew Content\nIf you purchased all available content from the previous campaign and wish to complete your collection, then all you\u2019re missing is:\nThe expansion \u201cWhat Goes Up, Must Come Down\u201d: this expansion includes two new curses along with new ways to explore the continent.\nSatchel & Notebook binder: this game accessory will allow you to store all the cards that would normally be placed under the Satchel & Journal card.\nAll unlocked Stretch goals that become available during the campaign.\nThese items are included in the Veteran pledge.\nAlso, new \u201coptional purchases\u201d will become available during the campaign (see \"Optional buys\" section). \nThe USA, European Union, Canada and Australia will all be \u201cShipping Friendly\u201d. This means that backers from these countries will not incur any import taxes.\nAfter our experience with the first campaign, we are planning on two waves of shipping for this new project.\nThe First Wave will include the new \"Second edition\" base box and non-cards optional purchases (such as bone dice & dice bag, sleeves, etc.). This wave is slated for March 2018.\nThe Second Wave, due in October 2018, will include the new expansion \"What Goes Up, Must Come Down\", all optional buys with cards (old and new) as well as Stretch Goals from this campaign.\nShipping will be paid AFTER THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN, during the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d phase. Below, you will find an estimation of shipping costs per shipping area. Despite this, we are committed to these prices being the maximum amount you will have to pay.\nDuring the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d phase, you can ask to receive everything, including the Base Box, in Wave 2 (due in October 2018) in order to reduce shipping costs significantly when compared to the cost of both waves (although still more expensive than the wave 2 shipping shown below).\n*You can choose to have this optional buys shipped on wave 2 \u2013 instead of wave 1 \u2013 to avoid paying for the shipping fee associated.\n**Europe (A): Germany, United-Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland and Austria.\n**Europe (B): Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Czech Republic.\n**Europe (C): Albania, Armenia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Croatia, Finland, Iceland, Montenegro, Norway, Serbia, Turkey, Ukraine (Note: the lower part of the estimate).\nNote: recently updated for GREECE, ROMANIA and SWEDEN.\nAlso, South Korea is in Area 4 \u2013 lower part of the estimate\nWould you like to pledge for multiple copies?\nEach copy purchased includes all unlocked Stretch Goals. For areas 1, 2 and 3, shipping costs after the first pledge (up to a maximum of 7) are halved! We are still looking for solutions to get some discount for multiple copies for areas 4 and 5 as well (hopefully by the end of the campaign).\nWe\u2019re two friends that love playing and making games. Also, one of us is pretty handy with a pencil.\nFounded in 2010, Serious Poulp was all about seeing the games we designed come to life.\nSerious Poulp Inc. is the name of the North American branch of Serious Poulp. It was created in 2017 to help us develop our business in North America.\nThe first Kickstarter campaign for The 7th Continent was successfully funded back in October 2015 thanks to the support of 12,103 daring explorers! Two years later, with a lot of experience from this first adventure under our belts, we\u2019re back with some new ideas that we just couldn\u2019t keep to ourselves!\nLudovic Roudy and Bruno Sautter\nTwo friends passionate about all things gaming! We\u2019ve been working together for almost 15 years in the digital communication agency we created in 2002, then as Serious Poulp, which we founded in 2010, when the temptation to publish games became too strong to resist.\nRole-playing games and gamebooks played a significant part in both our childhoods. Bruno was 5 when \u201cThe Warlock of Firetop Mountain\u201d was published. Ludovic was 11 and already had a few prototypes on the go (one of which would eventually become The 7th Continent!).\nWe've been inspired by many great works during our lives, whether from board games, role-playing games or video games. When we started out in the board gaming industry, we naturally brought all of these elements with us.\nWe are not only the designers of the 7th Continent - Ludovic also creates all of the illustrations and visual elements for our games and Bruno, apart from writing cards and rulebooks, supervises production.\nJamie \u201cWhelpslayer\u201d Johnson\nJamie is the Community Manager for The 7th Continent and the scourge of small draconic beings. Rolling dice, pushing toy soldiers and trading sheep for many a moon now, Jamie is, just like you guys, a gamer at heart. He\u2019s also a publisher himself with his own company, Holy Grail Games.

Think of this game as one of the genetic-precursors to a whole new globe-spanning game genre.\nFUN FACT: To start the spirit of the game, we have hidden various Easter Eggs that we allude to within the text of this Kickstarter campaign. Try to find all of them and post your results in our introduction post on the Bitcointalk forums.\nHow it Works:\nBackers receive a Memix shirt and initial MEMX tokens to be used in a worldwide game played both socially and on the Ethereum platform.\nAs it currently stands, there is one overriding rule of the game:\nWhomever has the majority of MEMX becomes the CryptoMaster and can create the rules of the game.\nSince Tamaki Ride Limited is the current CryptoMaster, our additional rules of the game are as follows:\nThe total supply of MEMX is capped at 111,111,111 Tokens (this is unchangeable as the nature of the Ethereum blockchain). \n100,000,000 of these tokens are used as the 'contribution supply'. No more will ever be created. \nKickstarter Backer Rewards come with bonus MEMX to help jumpstart the game. All bonus MEMX will come from the contribution supply and to validate players via Ethereum wallet addresses.\n500,000 MEMX from the founder's supply will be distributed to various members of the community as a bounty to assist in helping this Kickstarter campaign gain traction.\nAny backer that wears the official Memix T-Shirt on Youtube, Vimeo or Twitch and if this video post hits over 10,000 views we will supply that backer with additional MEMX tokens (after judging whether the Memix logo was clearly visible for more than 10 seconds). \nFor the first 10,000 views 0.5% of the remaining contribution supply will be awarded (rounded up to the nearest decimal point)\nFor every next power of 10, we will provide any valid video poster with additional 0.5% of the remaining contribution supply. So 1st Tier = 10K, 2nd Tier = 100K, 3rd Tier = 1 Million etc.  Each Tier can earn 0.5% of the remaining contribution supply (which depletes as rewards are given).\nWe will award MEMX as points until we are not the majority owner any longer. \n Any MEMX holder that proves that they are the majority owner becomes the new CryptoMaster and can set the new rules. \nClaiming the MEMX tokens happens through simply posting the video, as proof, on our upcoming forum (memix.io). \nValid posts (with a clearly shown Memix logo for over 10 seconds) will be rewarded in sequential order on a first-come-first-serve basis, as long as a valid wallet address is provided. \nOnce another owner of an Ethereum wallet address can prove that they own more MEMX than we do, we relinquish the right of ownership of the domain name and forum to the new majority owner, and the rules of the game may change to whatever the new owner wishes.\nGame Characteristics \nThe MEMX token is an Ethereum-based, ERC20 token that is used as points to win the game. This crypto-token has unique properties bestowed upon it:\nNo fancy algorithms \nNo mining, just meme-ing, miming and mimicking \nNo complex, and legally grey \u2018ICO\u2019 (Initial Coin Offering) \nInstead, we are offering a simple \u2018ITO\u2019 (Initial T-Shirt Offering)\nOur token generation is the first of it's kind: Proof-of-Shirt\nSimple way to receive Ethereum-based (ERC20) tokens\nExtra Benefit!  No extraneous strain on the Ethereum network during the crowdfunding as Kickstarter does all of the heavy lifting.\nUnlike ICOs, no ETH or BTC dumping!\nA new way to add fuel to existing, or up-and-coming, internet celebrities.\nMemix is a experiment in how blockchain-based tokens can be used to create emergent gaming. We are pursuing a way of creating fun, social dynamics that has the potential to generate its own buzz and viral marketing. It is our hope that the social nature of this game provides the feedback loop that propels it forward in new and interesting ways. It should be fun and compelling enough to watch what happens from the sidelines, and even more engaging to play a part in the unfolding.\nHelp us by being a part of this experiment to see how far we can take the idea of a borderless social game through the power and promise of the blockchain!\nQuestions\nWhat does Memix mean?\nMassive Ethereum Multiplayer Internet Xpedition? Mixing memes? ME + MIXed (Reality)? Truth be told, after trial and error, Memix rolled off the tongue and stuck. Hopefully it does for you too.\nWhat does the new CryptoMaster do with the domain name and forum once the game has been won?\nWhatever he/she wishes to do with it. But do me a favour. Try and use your powers only for good. OK?\nWhat type of people is this game targeted too?\nCrypto-enthusiasts, Gaming Geeks, Internet Celebrities, Gunters, Adventure Vlogers, Traders, Trolls, Hackers, Anonymous, Ludologists, Satoshi Nakomoto, and anyone else who fancies to try playing a new type of game in a new type of way.\nWhy is the total supply set to be 111,111,111 Tokens?\nBecause our players are going to 'one' so much, they\u2019re going to be so sick and tired of 'one-ing'.\nAlso we took a look at other popular cryptotokens such as Ethereum, Waves and Lisk and decided to aim at a similar amount.\nWhy are the rules so simple? Just get the majority of the coins? \n\u201cAudentes Fortuna Iuvat\u201d, is a Latin phrase that shapes our philosophy. To be straightforward, we are expecting emergent gameplay to come about. Will parties pool together to win? Will smart contracts be written to fairly pool resources? Will players play games outside the main game for tokens? Will celebrities appear or emerge for the community to side with? We don\u2019t know, but we\u2019re ready to find out. What type of player will rise to the top? What will the CryptoMaster do, once the game has been won?\nWhat ways can I generate views while wearing the T-Shirt?\nAnyway you think of! Or maybe something you do will just go viral. But to get you started, here are some ideas.\nPhotobomb a Congressional committee. \nAttend a basketball game in North Korea. \nHost a successful cryptocurrency video series. \nVideo yourself doing extreme sports. \nPlay a board game online with Wil Wheaton. \nMarket crashing & partner out on the town? Post a drunken rant that evolves into meme!\nWhy do you choose only Youtube, Twitch or Vimeo?\n\u201cYTV?\u201d, you say\u2026 Besides being the current CryptoMaster and having the right of setting the rules? Simply put, these sites are popular, they clearly show viewership, and have basic rules on what is appropriate or not. This makes our lives easy to ensure that the game is played fairly.\nWhat will happen if someone uses a counterfeit T-Shirt?\nSince we give MEMIX tokens with every T-Shirt, we will have the Ethereum wallet address for each T-Shirt awarded in the ITO crowdfunding (since a wallet address will need to be given to receive the MEMIX tokens that come with each T-Shirt).\nWe will only honour the wallet addresses that have proven to back the project with tokens for reaching the valid number of views.\nWhat matters the most is the wallet address. This means that you could back the Shirtless Reward, receive the MEMX tokens (which will give us a record of your wallet address) and then make your own shirt. This is a perfectly valid way to play!\nCan somebody win without having been an original backer with an original Ethereum wallet?\nYes. Anyone that can prove that they have the largest supply of MEMX can win the title of CryptoMaster. This is to encourage the emergent gameplay aspect.\nCan a group or corporation win the right to be a CryptoMaster? Or does it need to be an individual?\nThere are no restrictions on who becomes a CryptoMaster, besides proving to be the owner of an Ethereum wallet that holds the MEMX tokens. Tamaki Ride Limited just happens to be a corporation that is also the very first CryptoMaster. But the next winner can be an individual, a knitting group, a world-dominating secret cabal, a DAO, or a self-aware AI with the affinity for soft-spoken passive aggressiveness. This is part of encouraging any emergent gameplay that may result.\nWhat happens to the game once a new CryptoMaster is crowned?\nWe have no idea, as it would represent a new chapter in the game. We are hopeful that the new ruler is benevolent and fun, and the play continues. Considering that many of the ones joining are gamers and players, we are more than optimistic that the game will go on.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur risks and challenges are very slight.
