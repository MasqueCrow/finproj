Unger is a sculptor and mosaic artist in Hudson, NY best known for his Sculptural Firebowls.His mosaics have been commissioned by the American Museum of Natural History, Budweiser and Stagecoach Music Festival, Chicago Public Art Group, Chef David Burke,Alden State Bank,  Northeastern University, MA, Limelight Lodge, Aspen, CO, Lakeview Baseball Club, Chicago, IL and many residential clients and private collectors.\n\u00a0\nHis mosaics have been featured in Smithsonian Magazine, the book and touring exhibit Mythic creatures: and the impossibly real animals who inspired them from the American Museum of Natural History, JoAnn Locktov\u2019s seminal book Mosaic Art + Style: Designs for Living Environments, Garth Johnson\u2019s 1000 Ideas for Creative Reuse: Remake, Restyle, Recycle, Renew, the cover of Pompei, Italia by Francesco Erbani, the cover of\u00a0Envisioning Black Feminist Voodoo Aesthetics by Kameelah L. Martin, The Toronto Star, Microsoft Home Magazine, and AHA! A House For Arts on WMHT, PBS.Self-taught as a visual artist, Unger\u2019s training in poetry at Interlochen Arts Academy, Naropa, and Stone Circle brings a depth and lyricism to his visual works. Music, myth and metaphor are woven into his work, a foundation of story and song. Using a variety of media, he seeks to marry construction and context. Materials and techniques are chosen for their impact on narrative, meaning and nuance as much as for form or function.To make art that will last, he looks to the past for examples that still delight after millennia\u2014 believing the simplest forms are most likely to remain relevant. Natural history, music, literature and ancient art are his strongest inspirations.From performing his poetry on stage at Lollapalooza in 1996, to bartering a mosaic to a bank as a down payment for a house and studio, to displaying an American flag created\u00a0from over 20,000 Budweiser bottle caps at the 2015 Stagecoach Music Festival, Unger\u2019s art career has been as much about making good stories as making good art.", "websites": ["johntunger.com"], "url_link": "https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/johntunger", "name": "John T.

Like many of you, I have been playing board games since childhood. As a kid, I dabbled in creating both card and board games as well as computer games in the early 80's. Fast forward 20 years to when I started Knight Works back in 2000. I have been eagerly working on board game designs, of various complexities, ever since. \n\u200b\nI ended up self-publishing, and hand producing, my first game called Shadow Wars in 2000. Only 60 (or so) copies of that game were ever produced. It was not until my discovery of Kickstarter in early 2011 which allowed me to professionally manufacture a small print run of games.Our first Kickstarter campaign was for a Wild West dice Euro game called Dark Horse, which was released in 2012. Since then, we have had four other game releases. The first was an expansion for Dark Horse called Rebels & Rogues in 2014. We followed that up with a release of two (back to back) games called Forged in Steel and Hands in the Sea. Both of those games were well received and the Kickstarter campaigns were successful in 2015. In Fall 2016, we fulfilled both games to backers and were excited when both games quickly sold out within the first few months.More recently, we teamed up with Vital Lacerda and his daughter Catarina on Dragon Keepers which was successfully funded in 2018! We are still working on several other titles for future release and we look forward to publishing many thematic games in the future!", "websites": ["KnightWorksGames.com", "facebook.com", "twitter.com"], "url_link": "https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/knightworks", "name": "Knight Works", "no_of_backed_proj": "Backed 327 projects", "location": "Colorado Springs, CO", "joined_date": "Joined Apr 2011"}, [{"title": "Stellaris Infinite Legacy", "content": "A 4X board game based on the acclaimed Stellaris PC game featuring 2 hour games full of story and exploration.", "project_link": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/academygames/stellaris-infinite-legacy?ref=profile_backed", "creator_link": "https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/academygames", "backers": "by Academy Games and 13,294 backers"}, {"title": "Night Market", "content": "Worker Placement game set in a Night Market where you are bringing in customers and creating  signature dishes.", "project_link": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/talonstrikes/night-market?ref=profile_backed", "creator_link": "https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/talonstrikes", "backers": "by Talon Strikes Studios and 968 backers"}, {"title": "Miniature Painting Masters (Canceled)", "content": "Learn to paint miniatures with 4 world-famous artists!", "project_link": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1302528630/miniature-painting-masters?ref=profile_backed", "project_fail_status": "funding canceled", "project_end_date": "project canceled on april 19, 2021"}, {"title": "Crafting Arzium", "content": "A documentary feature film about board game designers Ryan and Malorie Laukat!", "project_link": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zoomoutmedia/crafting-arzium?ref=profile_backed", "creator_link": "https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/zoomoutmedia", "backers": "by Zoom Out Media and 1,253 backers"}, {"title": "Dangerous Destinations Hardcover or PDF for any Fantasy RPG!", "content": "The definitive guide to creating intriguing and dynamic destinations for storytelling and fantasy roleplaying games!", "project_link": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nordgames/dangerous-destinations?ref=profile_backed", "creator_link": "https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/nordgames", "backers": "by Nord Games and 5,312 backers"}, {"title": "Darwin's Journey", "content": "Retracing Darwin\u2019s journey to the Galapagos in an exciting Worker Placement euro game by Simone Luciani and Nestore Mangone.", "project_link": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gonab/darwins-journey?ref=profile_backed", "creator_link": "https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/gonab", "backers": "by Gonzalo Aguirre Bisi and 16,759 backers"}, {"title": "Tinners' Trail - a game by Martin Wallace", "content": "Tinners' Trail - a board game by Martin Wallace, redeveloped for the modern era by Alley Cat Games", "project_link": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/alleycatgames/tinners-trail-a-game-by-martin-wallace?ref=profile_backed", "creator_link": "https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/alleycatgames", "backers": "by Caezar and Kuly from Alley Cat Games and 3,974 backers"}, {"title": "Illumination & The Road to Canterbury by Alf Seegert", "content": "Two Great 2-Player Games by a Master of Best-Played-by-Two Games including Fantastiqa, Rival Realms, Heir to the Pharaoh, Mus\u00e9e & Haven", "project_link": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/eaglegryphon/illumination-and-the-road-to-canterbury-by-alf-seegert?ref=profile_backed", "creator_link": "https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/eaglegryphon", "backers": "by Eagle Games and 611 backers"}, {"title": "\ufffd Alba - an Open World Adventure Book \ufffd", "content": "An innovative branching narrative gamebook, set in a desolate post-apocalyptic world.
