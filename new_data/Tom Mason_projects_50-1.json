Instead, crossing continental distances, only to reach the wall of a \u2018room\u2019. Passing beyond will only bring yet another room on the other side of it, with new lands stretching off just as far again.\nAlthough all manner of threats exist out in the wilds, such as strange animals and beasts, and other barbaric or dangerous people, the greatest dangers of all, are the Rooks. Huge, hulking stone automatons that patrol, somewhat mindlessly, out in the wilds of the Colostle\u2019s rooms.\nThat is until they are disturbed. Every Rook is different, there are no two the same, and they are the only source of magic in the world. As such, they are something of a target to hunters looking for tech they can scavenge, artefacts they can sell or magic crystals to grant them strange and unpredictable powers.\nThat is if they can bring one down...\nA 'room' stretching out before an Armed adventurer...\nWhat is a solo RPG?\nThink of it like a personal, mindful writing exercise, where the game provides you with prompts to write your own fascinating adventure in this strange world. You will be keeping a journal of your adventures, and the game system is a way to determine what you will encounter along the way, and to dictate the outcome of combat. All the book provides is prompts and inspirations, but it is up to you and your character to flesh out the details and to write about what you discover.\nFirst you need to create a character, someone of this world. This book will guide you through this process, but it is completely up to you. Then the game provides you with an outline of your first adventure. You can decide how to interpret these prompts and what to write, there are no limits to what you can do, this is YOUR adventure.\n\nWhat is in the book?\nThe Colostle book will be a 24 page A5 tome with all the rules required to create and play your own Colostle adventure. The book will have a thick 300gsm cover with foiled lettering, and the internal pages will be on off-white recycled paper for an otherworldly look and feel. The book will also feature black and white illustrations throughout suggesting glimpses of the world and the kind of characters you could create.\nDesign of the interior black and white pages (mockup)\nHow does the game work?\nThe basic principle is that of drawing cards from a shuffled deck of playing cards, and checking their colour, suit or number against tables to see what they represent for your adventure.\nIn the exploration phase of the game cards might stand for meeting another traveller on your journey, finding some abandoned ruins or discovering a mysterious doorway. its up to you to write in your journal what these things are and what they mean for your character. The game simply suggests things, like writing prompts, set against a fantastical world... its up to you what they all mean for your greater story. In the Combat phase, cards stand for attacks with the numbers on the cards showing their strength. Playing the right card at the right time could mean victory for your character!\nAs you play and write you will find ideas for what the mysteries of the Colostle might mean, just falling into your head. I don't provide the answers in the book, every player will discover their own truth and meaning of the world.\nAll you will need is a deck of playing cards, a pen, some rough paper for making gameplay notes and a journal to record your character's adventures in.\nHow to Play Colostle - Example of a typical Exploration and Combat phase in the game\n3 Unique Character classes\nTo play Colostle you will need to create a character, and to that end there are 3 unique classes introduced in the book that will help you do that. They are; The Armed, The Followed and The Helmed. All of them use parts and pieces harvested from Rooks that give them special abilities. I don't want to give everything away, as it is only a small book (!) but you can see an Illustration of The Armed class below.\nThe Armed - wielders of harvested Rook arms\n Rewards + Stretch Goals Breakdown\n Cheaper Shipping Options\nIf you look in the rewards you will notice that some rewards have an identical twin with the added 'Cheaper Shipping' to their title. This is because I found a cheaper shipping cost later in the life of the campaign after these tiers had been already added. If you are a new backer, and you live outside the UK, please make sure you select the 'Cheaper Shipping' version of the tier you would like, to make sure you get the best deal on your shipping.\n(These 'Cheaper Shipping' options only exist for the top 3 tiers, \u00a320 or over. The lower tiers have accurate international shipping as they are, so you don't need to worry about those)\nNew artwork for the 'Oceans' module!\nNew artwork for the 'Battlements' module\nWho am I?\nMy name is Nich Angell and I am a comic book artist, illustrator, writer and game designer. I am one quarter of the stories-and-games company Big Punch Studios, creators of comics such as 7STRING, Afterlife Inc., and Cat and Meringue and the super fun card game Sandwich Masters!\nI have worked on a lot of comics and games, both from an illustrator perspective and a concept/creation one. More than anything I love creating worlds, whether thats a place to hear a story from, or a place to play a game in, making worlds is my thing! So when I found out about solo RPGs and played a few I realised what an awesome thing they were, a small tight rulebook for a brand new world.\nAs someone with a wild imagination I am always coming up with new ideas and Colostle is the latest setting that popped into my head. This time though, I was excited to create a more open ended world so that others can experience the joy I have creating stories, adventures and mysteries.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have worked on many graphic novels and as such am extremely familiar with creating books and making artwork printready. I have run a great many Kickstarters both on my own and as part of Big Punch so I am highly confident in the process and know the extent of what is involved.\n\nAs with all of my Kickstarters and those I have been a part of, I believe communication is key. I know to update regularly and keep the backers informed even if unforeseen delays or problems occur.\n\nWith a small book and a small print run like this I don't foresee any issues. The kinds of things might be print delays, quality issues, and delivery but I have plans for all of these issues if and when they appear.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nReusability and recyclability\nThe book will not be packaged in any plastic shrinkwrap or film, and will be delivered in a fully recyclable cardboard book envelope. The book itself as it is all card and paper is fully recyclable too.\nSustainable materials\nAll the interior pages of this book are printed on recycled paper.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nThe printers I have selected for this project put the environment first. They have reduced their use of solvents and other hazardous waste down to almost zero, reduced their setup waste to almost zero and recycle every offcut created during the manufacturing process.\nSustainable Distribution\nThe printer I use are UK based which means any UK orders will not involve costly international bulk shipping.

Read more about it in the update #5\n\nHave you ever had the problem of needing to describe a dungeon and none of the players could really imagine how the structure is actually built? You don't always have to draw a battle map. Sometimes a small picture is enough to quickly show what the situation around the players looks like. Or did you ever try to come up with a dungeon room on the fly and just could not come up with an interesting layout? This deck of dungeon cards is perfect for those situations. 36 (now 54) unique cards full of stairs, dark corners, slim corridors, claustrophobic rooms, crates, barrels and much more to place monsters and treasure in.\nCards can be either used separately or combined to form larger dungeons. You can reveal one card after another as your players make their way through the dungeon and make them curious about each corner.\nThe cards are made out of professional 310gsm card stock with a blue core and smooth linen finish for the professional look & feel. The deck comes in a custom printed tuck box with a protective matte coating to give your cards the home they deserve. \nSpeaking of... Each map (as well as the back of the card and the box) is completely hand-drawn. All 36 cards are already done and just need to be sent off to the printer.\nSo why Kickstarter? This is a test for me to see if such a deck is even wanted by enough people. If this project gets funded I can let the cards print for a reasonable price per deck without making a loss or charging an impossible high price.\nSupport Tiers\n5\u20ac - Get the PDF\nYou will get the full Deck of Dungeons (including the back side) as a PDF. This is perfect for those that would like to support this project but can't (or don't want to) afford the price of the physical deck + shipping costs.\n15\u20ac - Get the printed deck\nYou will get the physical Deck of Dungeons. Perfect for Dungeon Masters, as a present or just as a collectors item.\n18\u20ac - Physical & digital deck\nGet both - The PDF and the printed deck. This is for people who play classically as well as digitally or want to collect the printed deck and use the digital one.\nIf you want more than one deck please contact me with the shipping country. I would need to calculate the additional costs depending on where to ship. Thank you for your understanding :)\nStretch Goals\nI am very hesitant when it comes to stretch goals for this project. This is my first kickstarter and I just want everyone to get what they expect and as smoothly as possible. But if the project gets a lot more supporters than expected, I probably have no choice. So here is the goal:\n[Unlocked] 300 Supporters - 54 Cards\nIf we hit 300 or more supporters I will increase the number of cards in this deck to 54. It doesn't matter if for the physical deck or the PDF version. If we reach 300 backers the deal is sealed. I will invest some extra time to come up with 18 additional cards.\nSo if you would like to have a thicker deck make sure to share this project and encourage your friends to grab a copy as well ;)\n Shipping\nThe Deck of Dungeon gets shipped worldwide. The shipping costs will be added after you selected your pledge level. \nGermany: 6 \u20ac\nRest of the EU, USA, Canada, Japan: 11 \u20ac\nRest of the world: 13 \u20ac", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEven though this is my first kickstarter I am fairly confident that everything will go smoothly. The designs for the deck and tuck box are done and I already got several prototype prints of the deck from the printer to check the quality and made some adjustments.\n\nOf course it is always possible that something goes wrong during each step of the process and the shipping could get delayed.

Still, you push along doing the best that you can. Yet, as you move forward you can't help but feel stress & anxiety about the future. \"Will I actually succeed with my art?\" \"Is it even possible to find an art career that will pay my bills and  fulfill me creatively?\" To make things worse, you sometimes cave into your fears because of social distancing and/or your past.\nWell, listen up!

I've written a guide to help you make it happen. \nThese may be BOLD words from a stranger - Why can I make you this promise?\n\n\nMy name is Will Terry and I am a successful  illustrator. - I\u2019ve illustrated over 30 children\u2019s books for publishers like Scholastic, Penguin Random House, and Simon Schuster. I co-founded the wildly popular illustration podcast - 3 point perspective. I co-founded SVSLEARN.com with Jake Parker and Lee White where we teach illustrators all over the world. I\u2019ve created a thriving comic convention brand. I taught illustration and business practices for 9 years at UVU. I\u2019ve been giving entrepreneurial advice on my popular YouTube channel  for over 10 years!\nThe point is, I've made my own successful illustration career. I, along with 12 other award winning illustrators, will show you how to make yours.\n\n What They Don't Teach You In Art School is a guide to help you create new opportunities using your art skills to pay the bills, even if you have no prospects right now. \nIn this BEAUTIFUL 300-page fully illustrated hard cover book; you're going to learn:\nIndustry Insights\nYou will learn the most relevant professional practices I use in my career to this date. To name a few: How to find clients, how to price effectively and close deals, how to figure out which industry your art is best suited for, how to correctly invoice, industry mistakes you should avoid, and more...\nThis means you will be fully prepared to find and secure the right opportunities that will fulfill you creatively and pay you fairly.\n\nHow To Land Your Dream Art Job\nFor some of you, landing that nice prestigious illustration job at a famous company like Disney, Riot games, or DreamWorks is your dream.

You will learn how to get the best freelance work, how to get your work discovered to attract more clients, how to correctly structure your portfolio, best practices to follow as a freelancer, and more\u2026\nThis means that you will be able to create the freelance work-hard/play-hard lifestyle you want, earn a living, and still have time for conventions and games.\n\nHow To Create Your Own Brand\nAs artists, what we want most is to be known for our accomplishments and abilities.

You could spend an entire academic career at an art university and still not even come close to learning the gems that are in this guide. \nLuckily, this isn't art school so you won't have to take out student loans to get access to this valuable information. For this Kickstarter only, I am going to give you access to a massive discount. \nI'll give you one copy of \"What They don't Teach in Art School\" for the price of $29 for a soft cover or $39 for a hard cover. \nThe invaluable knowledge of how to monetize your art skills and craft your own successful career all for a fraction of the cost of student loans, housing, text books, and Tuition. This deal lasts only for the duration of the Kickstarter. It will go back to full price afterwards. Claim your guide at a massive discount today!\nSoft Cover\nHard Cover\n\n\nSo What? Why should I care? \nThe vast majority of artists out there have the art skills to earn a living, but they have no clue how to monetize their skills; so they starve. Artists just assume that if they don't have any opportunities to make money with their art now; they will never have any opportunities in the future. This is false. They just lack the understanding of how to apply their art.\nWhat They don't Teach in Art School gives artists the edge they need to go out there and make a successful career for themselves. \nIf you personally apply the principles in this book:\n* You'll learn how to establish a career where you are both earning a living and creatively fulfilled.\n* You'll learn where to spend your time to get your career off the ground and save a lot of money in the long run.\n* You'll skip past mistakes and obstacles that inexperienced illustrators make in the industry today.\n* You won't have to listen to that naysayer in your life, you know the one, and instead you'll take life into your own hands.\n* You'll be recognized for your own content and your own brand.\n* You won't have to be afraid of the future and instead look at it as your oyster.\nFear is a tough thing to shrug off. It paralyzes you from head to toe; preventing you from taking the necessary steps towards success. The greatest source of fear is the anxiety of not knowing how your future will play out. But let me clue you in on a secret, the future is yours to decide. You have what it takes! Decide to make your future a bright one. I wrote this guide to help illustrators, like you, to succeed in the most challenging time of your life. It's going to take work, there are no shortcuts, but there are open highways.\n- Will Terry\n\nShipping & Fulfillment\nBoth soft & hard cover books are ready to be printed!\nBooks will ship to the United States & Internationally. You will not pay for shipping until after the completion of the Kickstarter during fulfillment  (estimated to be in October). I will be using Backerkit to help me with fulfillment. Backerkit makes fulfillment quick and easy! I will not mark up shipping whatsoever, you will only pay what is fair.  \nWhen we are ready to ship the books (probably in October) you will receive an alert to complete a survey (to be sent to the email address that you provided with your pledge). That survey will ask for your current/updated mailing address to ensure that your order will arrive to you directly. You will pay for shipping at that time -AND- GREAT NEWS: YOU WILL ALSO HAVE THE OPTION TO ADD MORE COPIES TO YOUR ORDER AT THAT TIME! You'll also have the chance to purchase add-ons, such as other books and prints by Will Terry.\nIf you have any further questions, feel free to ask me personally.

I specialize in comics, illustration, and designing characters, robots, and machines. You may also know me from Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, or as the creator of the popular online art challenge: Inktober. \nIt's been 3 years since my last art book and I thought it was high time to make a new one just for you! \nThe book will be beautifully printed by a 4 color offset printing press. It will be a softcover, perfect-bound book that will fit nicely with the other books in the DRAWINGS series. It will hold a comprehensive collection of both finished and exploratory artworks from the last three years, including an exclusive SKULL CHASER comic made especially for it. There will be a step-by-step tutorial on my drawing process as well.\nThis is the FIFTH book in my series of DRAWINGS art books and I felt it was time to mix things up a bit and change the nature and design of these books for the next several publications starting with DRAWINGS 5.\nYou can order these books right now from my shop. If they're out of print, I have a digital download option available.\nAlong with the book there's a bunch of other stuff that is only available from this Kickstarter. I'm excited to make these things and get them out to you!\nNote: this is a living, breathing project. All designs are pretty close to what I would like to produce, but are subject to change.\n Note: \"ALL The Extras\" now includes the bookmark set as well!\n\nThe book is getting made! YESSS! And now we're shooting to add these stretch goals to your book - at no extra cost to you!!\n\nMy team and I are shipping from the US, so apologies for the high cost of shipping to countries outside of North America. We're charging *exactly what it costs us* to ship from the USA. So if you live in London or Sydney or Berlin, shipping prices are what they are. If we can find an affordable way to ship to you we will use it, and keep you updated here.\nAll rewards will be sent out at the same time (both signed and unsigned). However, if there is a very high number of backers, please keep in mind that it will take us a few days to work our way through packaging all the rewards. \nUnforeseen delays that are out of our control can occur during delivery, so please allow an additional two weeks before checking up on your package. We will be doing our best to make sure everything gets to you on time!\nSometimes orders get lost or damaged in the mail. In that case, we will work with you to make sure you get your book. For instance, if your book is damaged, please contact us and we will have you return the damaged book for a replacement. We are not responsible for lost packages marked as \"delivered.\" \nIt's Kickstarter season, and that means a few friends of mine are also running Kickstarters right now. If you like what I'm doing here, you might also like these projects. \nAll of these creators I know personally and know that they supplement their income with conventions and with the situation right now none of us are sure if selling at shows will be an option this year. Just a couple bucks from a bunch of people could make a huge difference for these projects.  Go check them out and throw some support their way!\nDerek Laufman's Creations\nCreations Vol 1 is Derek Laufman's first art book entirely comprised of original designs. The book will be jam packed with hundreds of illustrations, beautifully displayed across 100 pages and 7.5 x 10\" in size with a soft cover. This book is for all ages showcasing character designs, concept art, and visual development. With full color illustrations, rough sketches, traditional ink and ink washed artwork. It's a great book for professional artists, art directors, aspiring creators or just fans of art and pop culture. Printed In CANADA LINK\nDave and Fred's Story/Line\nFrom my friends Fred Shroeder and Dave Kellet comes one-on-one interviews w/ artists from comics & animation, talking about their craft. \"Art and Stories and the Art of Telling Stories.\" I was one of their \"test\" interviews and I think it's a great platform to learn about the craft of comics, while also elevating the art form.

It\u2019s a wallet with a pencil and replaceable sketchbook inside.The sketchbook is filled with tips, prompts, activities and more to get the creative juices flowing.  It comes in two styles designed by Parker Jacobs and Ralph Thomas. Our goal is to make drawing fun and to build great sketching habits. It also comes with an Artistic License which means you can do whatever you want in the name of art. Don\u2019t want to clean your room? Bam! Just flash your license!

I can't believe that I have enough support from people like you to get to do this for a living. It really is a childhood dream come true.\nThank you for your interest in this campaign.

Building good drawing habits and making sketching fun is the goal of our latest creation.  \n The wallet is 3.25 x 4.25\" and is made of high quality printed vinyl. The inside has an ID window pocket, a card pocket, and a money pocket for your cash. Each wallet comes with a small pencil and a 2.5 x 3.75\" replaceable sketchbook filled with drawing activities to prime the creative pump.  \nMany parents have asked me how to keep their young artist going. I believe they should provide them with a few things: \n\"Encouragement\" will need to come from you, but we can help with the \"fresh art supplies\" and \"inspiration\" to make drawing fun and accessible. Each wallet comes with a replaceable sketchbook filled with tips, prompts, activities and more to get the creative juices flowing. Your artist will definitely come away with new skills and fun stuff to draw. There are also plenty of blank pages that will allow unguided creativity. Our small blank, toned, dot-grid and lined books also fit this wallet. \nMany artists don't begin to carry a sketchbook until they hit college age or older. Help the young artist in your life to develop this habit early, it will only help them get better. Drawing at a young age should only have one goal...it should be fun. You'll have plenty of opportunity to dash their hopes and dreams later. Don't get hung up on, \"you drew the head too big,\" or \"the perspective is all wrong.\" Criticism before they're ready will squeeze the love right out of it. If they can keep drawing through middle school and into high school then they are probably ready for honest critiques. You'll know because they'll ask for it.\nWe've had this on the idea board for a couple years and thought it was time to make this thing. We have been trying several designs, interviewing young people, measuring pockets, checking out materials and so on. We love the final designs and know you will too. \n The first wallet was designed by the ever-doodling Parker Jacobs. Parker has been posting his daily doodles for the past decade. You may recognize his work from Paul Frank Industries, Yo Gabba, Gabba, The Aquabats and Goon Holler. Parker has a bad habit of letting his domain names run out.\n The second wallet was designed by Sketch Wallet creator Ralph Thomas. He's proven that even a mediocre artist can make a living in illustration and has spent the last 10 years as a game artist. When he's not drawing he's found riding his trusty green bike, \"the Bass-O-Matic\u2122\" or stealing Parkers websites (Exhibit A, Exibit B).\nSpecial Thanks to Miles, Raegan, and Aaliyah :-)\nPLAY", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs much as I want to pretend there are no risks - there are.

If you are a fan of 80's/90's road trip movies and retro video games, this movie is for you. It will capture those warm memories you have for gaming and remind you of those good times while making you laugh along the way. This will be a movie you can watch with the whole family. For fans of the Game Chaser's web series, this is not a 2-hour game chasers episode, it is a feature-length scripted comedy film. However, it will have everything you come to love from the show at its roots, just presented in a new and exciting way!   This will be a different format, of course, from the show (which is reality documentary style) But that's the point, to do something fresh and different!  \nWe've had an idea to do a movie for a long time, but it wasn't until someone approached us with the concept of a scripted comedy that the light-bulb went off. Our original idea a few years back was a country-wide road trip going to flea markets. Basically exactly what we do on the YouTube show, still keeping it a \"reality format\", and making it a feature-length movie. And while many might find that idea awesome, I found it boring. It's the same thing we already do just.....longer. And we have to depend on the chance of actually finding games. You wouldn't see Mevor, or Dodongo in it because or work obligations as well. For me, that idea just wasn't exciting. We never pursued it. We never tried to Kickstart it. Maybe we will down the road, but this idea that we have is so much more stimulating creatively for all of us, and a nice breath of fresh air. And the great thing about it for fans is that even though it's a fictional narrative, it still has the essence of the show. It's a refreshing take on Game Chasers. And we are super excited to bring it to life and show the world. \nNow, some people might be concerned over the fact that we have a Producer and that that means someone else other than us is calling the shots. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is OUR project, OUR vision, and the idea and direction is 100 percent OUR creations. We make the decisions. No one controls us, ever. They work for US, not the other way around. I just wanted to ease anyone's concerns that someone else was in charge of this project. This is GAME CHASERS only bigger and badder! What you love about the channel, you will love about this. \nThe plan is to shoot over the Spring/Summer and have it ready for release in 2020. There will be a limited theater run, at the minimum here in DFW. But there will also be digital downloads and Blu-rays as well! In the meantime the regular YouTube show isn't going anywhere, so don't worry.  \n\nWhat's it about????\nWell....I can only say so much. A lot of what will make it awesome to see for the first time is the big surprise we have in store. That's good enough, right??? RIGHT? NO? Fine......I can give a quick synopsis, I suppose...... Billy and Jay go on a road trip to track down a childhood gaming relic. And of course...a ridiculous adventure ensues.....a ridiculous adventure but not TOO outside the bounds of reality. Its main purpose is to be FUN to watch but also make you feel good!\nThink of this as a fictionalized Game Chasers Prequel. A fun re-telling of how 2 friends became game collectors. \nIt will be what you have come to love about the show mixed with stuff you would have never expected, but still fitting in with the spirit of what we do. And also mixed with bigfoots and aliens. Maybe. ;)\nPLAY\n\n\nOk, how about this? How about I list some words that are out of context but have actual meaning in the movie. Yes, Im a tease. \nMountain, NES, Shotgun, Campfire, Star Fighter, Gnome, 1988, Flea Market, Lemmy, Battle Toads, Rental, Motorcycle, Gaiden, Photograph, Basement, Drone, Trunk, Punchout, Tetris, Jarr, Abandoned. That's all you get. For now....\nFor another tease...scroll to the bottom and see a page from the actual script. \nThis is just a teaser paying homage to Gremlins, not any official art\nIn this video we go into the story a little more to hopefully help you understand the theme of what its all about.  \nMany of the Game Chasers show fan's favorite episodes were ones that made them both laugh and cry, and this movie will capture that same feeling. You will laugh, cry, cheer, and reflect. Fans of the web-show will get enjoyment out it, as well as those who are not familiar. Its a movie for fans and newcomers alike.  \n I (Billy)  have a passion for storytelling. I have enjoyed making the Game Chasers web series and will continue to do so, but my favorite projects have always been the ones where I can tell a story and or just be creative. The Under The Bridge Game Chasers Episode and our cartoons display that the most, I believe. This movie has been in the planning stages for a while now, but we feel it's finally time to move forward with it.  \nYour support right now of this Kickstarter is critical for it's success.\n Making a movie of this magnitude is expensive. As I said, this isn't a 2-hour Game Chaser episode. This is not us just taking a camera and going out a few days a week shooting video. We have a producer. We are hiring a professional film crew for this. We want this to be like any other movie you would see in a theater. THIS IS NOT a normal \"web series makes a movie\" scenario. Our goal is to shoot this movie on a RED Camera. A RED camera was used in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, to give you an idea of the quality. I DEMAND that this EXCEEDS your expectations.  We have always reached for the best quality in everything we do, and this is no exception. But besides the film crew, there are so many costs that go into this such as, location costs, insurance, paying the cast, props, transportation, post-production, CGI, licensing, lawyers, to name a few. We will need to hire people to do jobs such as accounting so we don't get sued or have the IRS come after us, a production manager so they can organize the dozens of people need to work on this and keep things on schedule, and also the cost of simple things like food for the crew that will add up quick. Luckily I (Billy) will edit so we can save money on that. As you can see, things add up quickly. 95k may seem like a lot, but in movie making terms 95k is still low budget. Remember, this isn't us filming on the fly at the flea market, this is a REAL production.   \nThis is a Pre-Sell. \nWe hope to Pre-Sell enough copies of the movie to cover the costs of making. If we don't, and our goal is not met, then Kickstarter will not charge your card. \nWHY CROWDFUNDING?\nCrowdfunding, or \"Eat Bacon\" as some would call it, is the best way to for us to bring this movie to you. Lucky for us, it's the year 2019 and the film industry has changed so much. There isn't a need to get a studio's backing or get deep pocket investors. We cut out the middle man and allow our product to be funded by the PEOPLE who want it DIRECTLY. The thing is, investors, dropping large sums of money will want a say in the movie, and rightfully so. We want to keep 100 percent control. We have TURNED down an offer for a TON of money from a potential investor because they wanted to make changes.  Our vision is important to us. With that said, we HAVE been able to secure smaller funding from a few sponsors who won't be taking any control. It's not a ton of money, but it helps, and we are always looking for more small sponsors who don't want say in the movie making aspect. \nObviously, we have always been great at taking low budget and making it look high budget. It's been our MO since we started. \nReminder: You wont be charged unless we hit our goal\nOf course, there are going to be people waving their finger saying we should get investors instead of going directly to our audience who would want to see this movie to fund it. They say we E bacon? With that said, we actually DO have some! As it stands we have around 7k committed from sponsors. However, you can play a huge part in making that higher. IF you guys help fund this now and early on in this campaign, more sponsors will be willing to jump on board since they will see there is a ton of interest and will be way more willing to get involved. However, they still wouldn't be sponsors who would get a say in how we make this movie. If so, we will turn them down. So if you want this to happen, let's do it as soon as you can! Let's show the people what the Chode Nation is all about!\nWe more than likely not make any profit off this. And we have no plans to pay OURSELVES for the work. Kyle Newman recently said he made nothing off the movie Fanboys in the end. I can see that happening with us. This is a passion project, but even passion projects require funding. If you want to see this movie made let's pull together an make one hell of a movie! \nHere is a pie chart that will show (generally) where the money will be spent. This as of now is a best guess, some areas could end up being cheaper, others more expensive.\nHere are a few further breakdowns of what you saw on the graph, and why exactly we need them. These are the jobs/things we will actually have to pay for and not get the \"friend\" hook-up.\nProduction Manager - This person handles the business side of things. Like managing the budget, making sure people get paid, employment issues, paperwork and etc. \nCinematographer - Behind the director (Billy and Melvor) this is the most important crew member. He or she is responsible for the look and cinematography of the movie. We can't do everything, so this person is vital for us. We want to hire someone who knows what they are doing, a professional. This will obviously cost but will be worth it. We want the movie to look good! But beyond that, if we hire someone who is cheap and inexperienced we run the risk of them making a mistake, and a mistake on a movie set can cost thousands of dollars and days of shooting. \nAudio Tech - This person is responsible for recording the audio on the set. Again, if someone messes up this job it can cost money and time, so a professional is needed. \nAssistant Director - While the director and co directors focus on the actual movie making, the Assistant director does the important \"dirty\" work to free up the directors time. Such as breaking down the script and planning the shooting days, and making sure all the people who need to be on set a certain day are there. They find the best and most efficient way to organize the shooting days to save time and money. \nSet Building - This is a must, and an expensive must. Some of our settings will need to be created because finding a real-life location that we need will be near impossible. I wish I could go into more detail but I would be giving away to much of the plot. Let's just say we will need to create a set that looks like it's from 1988. Also, a few of our settings would be impossible to film in a real life location because there would be no space to fit a camera and crew, so one would need to be built with only 3 walls, so a camera crew could be behind the \"fourth wall\". All this would need to be built on a sound stage which we would have to rent out from someone. Plus add the cost for materials and people to build said sets.  \nFilm Equipment - The DP will have a lot of gear but we will more than likely need to rent more and that cost can add up quick. Things such as camera mounts for a car, jibs, lenses, and lighting. Maybe even another camera if needed.  \nLocation fees - When we CAN shoot in real outside locations rather it be a building, a town, or someone's house, it is rarely ever free. Someone, whoever owns it, will want to be paid. Believe me, we will try to find a place for free or cheap, but it might not be possible.  \nSpecial Effects Tech - Sometimes its cheaper and easier to use miniatures instead of full size real life objects for a particular scene. Tons of movies use models and you never realized it. Apollo 13 and Avatar are two to come to mind, and we have one of the model makers who worked on those movies on board to work with us! He knows the art of the craft and how to make them look real on camera. We are talking professional half-scale and quarter-scale models, not little toys. Big difference. This will make our life SO much easier for a few things we have planned, but we still have to pay him. But it's totally worth it.\nActors - Some of the main actors will be friends, others will not. Regardless, we will still need to pay them. We can't ask someone to step away from work for a week, or a month, or even a few days for shooting and expect them to do it for free. We will also have a lot of actors who are not our friends...we will definitely need to pay them.... \nFlight/hotel -  This is another costly but necessary expense. We will need to fly actors and crew in and out all through the shooting phase. \nCatering - This is not in the pie graph but still important. You can't starve your actors or crew while shooting all day. Food will add up quickly. I hope they like Taco Bell...or bread and water...\nInsurance/legal - I hate this one, but it's a must. We are treading new ground here. We have to do things on the up and up to protect ourselves. We can't afford to get sued if someone gets hurt on set. And an entertainment lawyer is a MUST on a movie. One product or logo shown might open ourselves up to get sued, so we need council to tell us what's off limits. \nCGI artist - I already mentioned this but we have an artist who has worked on the Walking Dead on board. Now when I say CGI I don't necessarily mean crazy CGI sets or creatures (for the most part), a lot of CGI you see you don't even know you...see it.. Like wire removal, or fixing a mistake in the scene. CGI is an amazing tool to have, especially when a lot of times its cheaper than just re-shooting a scene. Cheaper...but not free\nMiscellaneous - This is everything else. Anything from fixing a broken piece of equipment, to gas for driving to a location.  On a movie set, something can always go wrong. An example would be as follows: We have scheduled a two-day shoot that's outside at a certain location. We have 12 cast and crew members that need to be there, and we have flights booked for everyone. The shoot day comes and then...it RAINS! We have to pay for two extra days of hotels for everyone and reschedule return flights. And some of those people might not be able to stick around after the rain to shoot, so we could have to re-shoot it a week or two later.Yeah, that would be a nightmare. An expensive nightmare. If we get more than expected out of this campaign, then this slice of the pie will get filled up even more due to the old saying, \"what can go wrong will go wrong\". \nCAMPAIGN FEES - Kickstarter's fees, together with the credit card processing fees, come to about 8.5% - 10%. At our goal of $95k that's up to $9,500. \nCheck out the production team so far. It isn't just a bunch of chodes (for the most part), we have real industry people working on this with us! \n\n\nMore on CGI With Yoshi\nHere, Yoshi talks about a somewhat unknown use for CGI that can have a huge impact on storytelling. CGI isn't just for space battles and crazy aliens....for the most part.\n here is Yoshi's IMDB and demo reel\nhttps://m.imdb.com/name/nm4668929/\n\nAgain, this is a Pre-SELL. If we don't hit the goal, you will get your money back, but if we do, then you will get a copy of the movie. \nWe are NOT asking for FREE money. You will get stuff in return. We are offering some cool rewards for you! You are the VIP of this project. We could easily ask you guys for money now, make the movie, then charge you again to buy it. We don't want to do that, so despite having a significant part of our budget go towards Blu-ray production, we want your money to go towards owning the movie as well as making it. You only have to contribute once to see it! If you ever wanted to be a part of a movie, see how it works up close, and know you helped make it happen, then we have a ton of cool rewards just for you! \nAnd remember, you can pledge as many times as you like. If you only want a digital download now, you can always come back before the campaign ends and get a Blu-Ray as well, or one of the higher rewards. Take a look on the right-hand side of all the reward details, but some of the stuff included are:\nUltimate Combo Pack!\nThis is the ultimate pack! Get the Blu-Ray, Shirt, name in the credits, and filming vlogs! This IS the combo you are looking for...\nConcept Art!\nGet art made just for the movie! This concept art is what is used to bring forth a visualization of what the scene should look like for filming. \nActual concept art drawn for the movie\nCome To the Premiere! \nCome hang out and see the premiere of the movie with us! This will be a special private first screening! Get VIP tickets and dinner with the cast and crew! It will be a blast, don't miss out!\npic is for example only. Official venue to be determined.\nHang out on set, and or be in the movie!\nWant a once in a life time chance to be behind the scenes when a movie is made? Or even update your IMDB profile with a role IN the movie? Either way, you are sure to have a hell of a time. \nnot the official sound-stage, pic only used as example\nPages from the First Working Draft! \nThis is a page from Jay's first draft of the script. There are notes as we made changes. You can get a page like this from one of 3 first draft working scripts from Billy, Jay, or Melvor.(Obviously the black lines are only so we don't give away the plot here on the kickstarter page and your page wont have them)\nThis is censored pic of an actual page of the actual script. Your page will have no black bars\nA VERY LIMITED VHS print\nThis VHS will be limited to 150 copies and each one numbered \"1 of 150\", \"2 of 150\", etc. It will have the movie itself but no extras. A great novelty item for VHS collectors! \n*artwork and title not yet finalized\n\nThere are even more awesome rewards to choose from! Just check out the list on the right side of the page and pick the one that is right for you! Or heck, maybe even 2 or 3...no nuts!\nOh, one more thing..... \nBlu-Ray, and poster art not yet finalized\nBlu-Rays - These are not cheap to produce. There is a reason most of the film kickstarter projects don't have this perk and the ones that do have them priced higher than a Blu-ray would normally be, it takes money away from your movie budget to make them. However, I know you most of you love physical media, so despite taking a piece of the budget away we are going to produce them for you! They will have exclusive stuff only found on the Kickstater Pre-order, so don't miss out! When we run out of these Blu-rays and print more to sell at cons and online well after the movie is out, they will be cheaper but have less content. So these are DEFINITELY the versions to get! These Kickstarter versions will have TWO discs with so much extra content. Plus...if you guys don't buy these now....we wont have the money to make the movie...\nArtwork - The artwork on the BLu-Ray and shirts are just to have visuals for the Kickstarter and are not the final product. I plan on hiring an awesome artist to make the poster/blur-Ray cover and make it look super epic. \nSo our goal of 95k is bare MINIMUM what we need to make this thing. We can make it awesome on that budget, however, we can make it even MORE awesome with these stretch goals!  WE will make the best movie we possibly can on 95k, but these goals are the key to taking things to an all new level. With this extra money we will do things like bring in a REAL famous actor or 2 for a cameo, add more complex scenes, bring in more people to help, and just overall add much more cool chodiness. Not only for the movie, but for the Youtube channel as well. Let's UNLOCK these stretch goals! \nRemember, if you want to throw in an extra dollar or $2 or $1000.....(i'm looking at you Bill Gates)....over what the perk costs, it will help! The more that do that, the more likely this goal will be met and exceeded. \nWhat About Game Chasers on Youtube???\nDoes this mean the end of the Game Chasers series? No way! In fact, check out the video below to learn how there could be MORE Game Chasers/Toy Chasers/ AND Chasing the Unknown.\nLastly, let me list a few films that we were inspired by while writing this script: \nFanboys\nPee Wee's Big Adventure\nDumb and Dumber\nBilly Madison\nGremlins\nGhostbusters \nTommy Boy\n\nOther Ways You Can Help\nSome people can't help fund this, but that doesn't mean they can't help:\nIf you want to help by offering your services (construction, make-up, costumes, etc) please let us know.  \nAnd it would be radical if you want to share this with everyone! \nI will share any video made by you that promotes this Kickstarter and encourages support! \nMake everyone aware!\nThank you so much for stopping in and checking this out. Together we can make this happen!\nEverything that is on this page is here for a reason. Even things you can barely see.....\n\nUpdate:\nHere at the bottom I will be posting various auditions as we receive them. Some for VERY small roles, and some for bigger ones. Keep in mind they are Auditions, it doesnt mean they have the part. I just wanted to post a few of these as teasers.

Choose your path and gather the greatest warriors of the age to your cause! Enter a world of magical treasures, wonders, and horrors. Compete against rivals in the bitter struggle for supremacy! The rules are deceptively simple and easy to learn, but you'll immediately face deep tactical choices in this dynamic battle game.\nThis ambitious Kickstarter campaign includes two new faction sets and a campaign book packed with adventures, lore, and much more! New Faction Sets not only expand the game, but also offer a great entry point for new players as they enter the dreaded Volgelands!\nGet the Volgelands campaign book, both of the new factions, and the Kickstarter Exclusive \"Vandas Greycloak\" miniature with the recommended Bold Adventurer pledge level! \n  Relicblade miniatures are cast in white metal for crisp detail.\nThe Volgelands Adventure Campaign Setting\nThe Volgelands is the first campaign setting for Relicblade, and the first in-depth exploration of the Relicblade world. The book centers on the region known as the Volgelands. The port city of Riverhold is the beating heart of these cursed lands where feral magic still hold sway. Founded on the divine principles of Justice, but controlled by a powerful merchant class. Riverhold stands at a crossroad, both as a center of trade and a symbol of hope. Adventurers seek out the city to find their path. From this indomitable city, brave souls set out into the Volgelands, seeking a new destiny in a dying world. \nThis campaign book is packed with tons of great content. Inside you'll find:\nRegional lore concerning the history of the Relicblade world, Riverhold, and the Volgelands.\nFaction lore focussing on the Temple of Justice, the Lone Guard, the Battle Pigs, and the sinister Bone and Darkness.\nMap based narrative quest lines.\nTwo dangerous new environments: the Scoured Plains and the Brackish Badlands\nSix scenarios in addition to the narrative quest lines.\nNew wild monsters that inhabit the Volgelands\nAnd optional campaign extras including Side Quests and more!\nJust look at this awesome map. Now imagine leading your warriors on this dangerous quest!\nThere is so much great content in this book! It's a little crazy to focus on one particular aspect, but I can't just upload everything and say \"SEE HOW COOL IT IS!!!\" with crazy eyes. But look at this dope map! These map based quest lines are great narrative adventures with cool details that bring it all to life. I can't wait for you to play through them.  \nScoured Plains illustration two-page spread.\nAlso, now that the cards are all in color I may as well make the books full color, right? Here is a preview of the Scoured Plains environment two page spread. Kinda neat, eh?\nIncluded in Adventurer Pledge and Above. Available as an Add-On during this campaign only.\nTo celebrate the launch of The Volgelands, I sculpted an exclusive miniature of Vandas Greycloak: the Torment of Dusk. Vandas is one of the cruel Dark Wanderers featured in the new book. This miniature will not be available for general release after this Kickstarter Campaign, so be sure that you don't miss out!\nThe Moldorfs come from a strange dwarven society deep underground. Utterly detached from the surface, these intrepid explorers set out to discover the truth about a mythical world... An \"outer land\" connected to an infinite \"outer space\". Though it is surely folly, a powerful hearthguard warrior and a razor sharp rogue join the Bibliothecary on this absurd quest. \nThe Moldorf Hearthguard\nA titanic underground world exists below our very feet. Immeasurable caverns spread into unknowable depths. Sprawling underground ruins extend into the shadowy abyss. It is from these depths that the Moldorfs emerge.\nMoldorf society is ruled by warlords from opposing houses. These households retain an elite core of Hearthguard warriors. In the tight corridors in which the hearthguard fight, they favor the use of massive shields and heavy war spears. From behind their brightly colored and richly decorated pavises, these fighters force their foes into unfavorable positions. \nTactically keen and lavishly equipped, the few Moldorf Hearthguard to reach the surface have quickly gained renown as formidable warriors.\nThe Shadowfoot\nShadowfoot belong to secretive clans. They are maniac rogues who stalk the shadowy depths with razor sharp daggers and dubious ambitions. In the complex political alliances between Moldorf houses, there is ample space for these shadowy agents. And though no household would ever admit to employing the Shadowfoot clans, a knife in the dark always has its place.\nThe quest to discover unknown realms promises both horrors and treasures. The opportunity to test their razor sharp skill is simply irresistible to these rogues. The Shadowfoot are ready to face anything the great unknown can throw at them, but is the greater world ready for them!?\nThe Moldorf Bibliothecaries\nThe Moldorf libraries contain countless manuscripts of the forgotten age. Arcane secrets were swallowed by the abyss and utterly lost. But so too, were the Moldorfs. Isolated from the powers that ravage the surface world, the Moldorfs learned magic from ancient texts. A strange wizard caste of librarians, or bibliothecaries, formed around the arcane arts. \nWithout the otherworldly patrons or raw creative energy present on the surface, the moldorf studies have naturally emphasized illusion magic. Though illusory magic is far less destructive than other forms, it is no less potent as they manipulate the battlefield. Bibliothecaries sew panic and chaos with massive illusory horrors and dazzling visions.\nAs the bibliothecaries collected and studied arcane writings, a strange sect began to believe in the existence of a surface world. They insisted the writings were not simply myths, but that they contain a metaphysical truth about the cosmic order. Now, these highly influential illusionists have gathered other bold explorers to their cause. They set out into the unknown. Traveling ever upward holding the ardent belief that a greater world exists in the unknown beyond. \nNeutral Alignment Faction!?\nThe Moldorfs are a neutral faction. That means any player, good or evil, may add Moldorfs to their party! Isolated underground, the Moldorfs have somehow avoided the cosmic struggle between good an evil. While players must still choose their alignment, neutral characters may be hired by any warband.\nWill you influence these strange subterranean explorers for good? Or will you manipulate them to serve your own selfish ambition? I guess we'll see... \nThe strange Lostwood stands to the west of Riverhold. It is the source of countless mysteries and haunting legends. The forests shifting boarders mark the boundaries of a most savage wilderness. Lone Guard watches stand vigilantly at its edge. Deep within the Lostwood stands an ancient empire ruled by the exile of the city of the dead, the immortal king Al'Adindred. \nThe Lostwood Enclave are a distinct faction who abide by the savage laws of nature. They are wanderers, protectors, and sages of the changed world. Though they are extremely dangerous, their souls are intimately tied to the advocate.\nThe Arboleth Sentinel\nThe arboleth are a powerful race of treefolk from deep within the mysterious Lostwood realm. They are slow to anger and deeply wise. Many proud generations have served the immortal king as peacekeepers. They are indomitable warriors naturally attuned with the will of the advocate. These singular beings are lawful, just, and frightfully strong. \nThe Wild Elf Pathfinder\nPathfinders are profoundly talented scouts able to navigate the most bewildering lands. They are keen hunters with the senses that reach beyond the physical realms. The wild elves are secretive nomads as a rule, however the pathfinders routinely interact with the greater world. \nOn certain foggy nights the Lone Guard are visited by these wanderers. They trade rare goods and exchange rumors before fading away as mysteriously as they came. There are even stories of pathfinders joining noble warriors on dangerous quests. The mist-like visitors lend their unearthly speed and stinging arrows to the righteous endeavor.\nWild Elf Druid and Cave Bear Form\nThe way of the Druid is a solitary existence. Druids are in communion with nature and abide within its savage laws. They take the shape of a wild beast and may spend years in this form without ever encountering civilization.\nThe shape of the mighty cave bear is among the most fearsome shapes a druid may choose. These powerful beasts can contend with the horrors and monstrosities that plague the land on equal terms. With tooth and claw these creatures are horrors in their own right.\nDRUID CREDIT OPTION:\nThe druid and bear are original sculpts from the first Relicblade release in 2015. The druid cards have been out of production for the past year, but with the Lostwood set she finds her place in a faction set with updated colored cards. \n2015 to 2018\nIf you already own the Druid and Bear figures you can opt for $10 credit toward add-ons instead of getting duplicate copies of these figures. You will get the Lostwood set without the druid and bear figures, but still receive the updated druid cards and the new elf and treeman figures. You will have the option to select a credit in the survey after the campaign ends.\nIn Relicblade, players recruit the ultimate squad of fantasy heroes or cruel villains as they battle for the fate of the world. Choose your path and gather the greatest warriors of the age to your cause! Enter a world of magical treasures, wonders, and horrors. Compete against rivals in the bitter struggle for supremacy! The rules are simple and easy to learn, but players are quickly engaged by deep tactical decisions.\nBehold! A disparate band of heroes set upon the path of the Advocate. A Moldorf Shadowfoot, Hellhound Berserker, Arboleth Sentinel, Cleric of Justice, and their Billman Companion.\nRelicblade \"factions\" represent groups that exist within the world. However, when you enter the game as a Seeker you choose between the good or evil alignments and gather heroes or villains to YOUR cause! Players use their influence to recruit characters.\nWill you be the fate that brings together a noble fellowship? Or will you bind wicked servants to your dark will!? \nA soldier pig, iguan poacher, ogre retiarius, dark watcher, and shild pig join forces on a dark quest.\nSpecialize your characters utilizing a vast arsenal of upgrade cards. Tactics, items, weapons, potions, and spells create the framework to customize your characters. Faction sets include a booster pack of cards with new characters and upgrades, so as each new set is released the options continue to grow with dynamic new list-building options. \nIn the example below this Iguan Slaver has a combination of defensive and ranged attack upgrades, which shifts his battlefield role and greatly increases his survivability. This particular build includes cards from The Wretched Hive, The Lone Guard, and Adventure Gear card pack.\n(some older cards were produced in black and white)\nWith the Seeker's Handbook campaign rules players construct a base and lead their characters on dangerous adventures to claim magical treasures. There are six scenarios, four environments, dangerous wild monsters, and rare treasures that pack each game with new dangers and unique challenges. The Seeker's Handbook is a wonderful source for limitless adventure. The Volgelands campaign book builds on the core rules in the Seeker's Handbook with tons of exciting new content. \nYou can learn a lot more about the game and how it's played on YouTube! There are gameplay overviews, unboxings, and battle reports ready to consume! Ash and Owen of Guerrilla Miniature Games and Gaming With The Cooler played multiple full Relicblade campaigns on their channels. So check it out!\nChoose the pledge level that's right for you. I try to offer pledge's suitable for a variety of hobbyists. From the ubiquitous PDF hoarder, to the much beloved completionist. To make things super easy I put the new stuff in one \"kickstarter recommended level\". \nThe \"Bold Adventurer\" pledge level is the core level for this campaign. It's the perfect level for new and veteran players. With these two faction sets you will be well equipped to enter the dangerous Volgelands. However, players will still need the core rules found in the Seeker's Handbook. You may purchase the book as an Add-on or purchase the book or a pdf right away from Relicblade.com/shop\nThe Champion of Adventure pledge level will equip you with everything you need for a FOUR PLAYER RELICBLADE CAMPAIGN!!! Is $180 kinda expensive? Sure, it is for me... but it's EVERYTHING you need for up to FOUR players to enter a world of adventure. Good luck getting your gaming group started on a new tabletop miniature game for less :)\nNow that you mention it, I spent that much on a single warband earlier this year... So I feel confident that this is an awesome value.\nWhat's a Custom Character Card?\nYou tell me about a D&D character you used to play or any character you can imagine. Then I will do an original illustration of that character. But the fun won't stop there! I will also stick that character on a special character card and make up some sweet rules and stats for your them! The custom card will be your ideas collaboratively realized in Relicblade. You're welcome to create heroes, villains, relics, or monsters, whatever your heart desires.\nYou get the digital artwork and copies of your character card along with the other Legends from this campaign. All ten custom character commissions will be collected in the \"Legends 4\" booster pack. This booster pack will be an official expansion for Relicblade for players to collect and enjoy. The first three Legends sets were extremely popular, so don't miss out on being part of a new generation of legends! \nMy sincerest hope is to raise enough money to produce the book and the two faction sets above. But as is Kickstarter tradition, I am happy to add a little wish-list in the form of stretch goals. There will be fewer than last year, but that's just because the core campaign has a heavy workload with an amazing book.\nStretch goals are a great way to boost the project outcomes as the budget increases. If we raise enough money to produce the new sets, then the money we continue to raise will push toward even more new content! Newly unlocked content will be available as Add-Ons once the goal is reached.\nGuest Artist: M\u00e1rk L\u00e1szl\u00f3\nThe Relicblade: Guest Artist Series RETURNS!! I'm honored to offer another excellent collaboration. As the creator of Relicblade I enjoy unbridled creative freedom. This privilege is granted by my generous Kickstarter Backers, so in this campaign I hope to extend the mantle of creative power to a guest artist! \nI love M\u00e1rk's style. He and I share a lot of the same influences. His work has tons of character with a mystical edge. He seemed like the perfect person to take my old idea for the Flame Bearer (crazed-fire-wizard) and transform it into something surprising and unique. I'm really delighted with the sketches he's sent so far, and I'm confident we're going to make an AMAZING miniature together!\nCard art by Mark Laszlo!\nHere is the proposed artwork and specs on the type of shirt we'll be using. \nVolgelands monsters have great art.\nThe add-on marketplace is a way to add a few extra items to your pledge. That way you can rest assured you are getting all the Relicblade goodness you can handle. To \"add-on\" simply increase your pledge total to include your selections. Then make a note of your choice so you can let me know what you wanted when the surveys go out! (Pro Tip: email yourself with the note so you can search for it later.)\nI highly recommend that new players pick up a copy of The Seeker's Handbook. You and a friend will be equipped to play a full campaign with this book and the Bold Adventurer pledge level.\nThe greatest testament to Relicblade is the amazing community on Facebook! \nDarkness force by Matt Lechtenberg\nThe group that has formed around RB is the best. They are kind, welcoming, and super talented! There are awesome battle reports, stunning paint jobs, and new friends waiting in the Relicblade Adventure Battle Friends. We have a forum available Here, too. But the facebook platform makes sharing photos and stuff super easy. So we tend to just use that the most.\nStonekin Battleborn by Mads", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have run three successful Kickstarter campaigns to create Relicblade and several expansions.

No. The medium wallet sketchbooks are roughly 3.5 inches square and are great to draw or write in. Everybody loves to draw or take notes on Post-It Notes and these books are larger than those, plus the square format is great for posting to Instagram :-) The small Sketch Wallet books are 2.5x3.75 which are slightly bigger than a standard sketch card. It's a fun size to draw or write in while making it a great size for even a front pocket. Each version comes in black or brown leather or black or gray canvas. Plus we threw in a tweed version just for fun. Keeping our vegan friends in mind, we picked a herringbone pattern tweed that is made from cotton, not wool. The space for the pencil or pen is actually larger than our original size wallet opening up many possibilities for new tools to carry.\nMedium leather wallets come in black or brown\nMedium fabric wallets come in brown tweed, black and gray canvas\nSmall leather wallets coming in brown or black leather\nSmall fabric wallets come in brown tweed or black and gray canvas\n If you're new to Sketch Wallet...\nSketch Wallet is a great way to always have your sketchbook with you. Or if you're the kind of person that would rather take quick notes on good old fashioned paper, this is the best way to do that. These wallet-sized books aren't intended to replace your full-sized sketchbooks or notebooks but are great for sketching or writing on the go when inspiration strikes. I've come to rely on mine and can't live without it. \nPLAY\n\nSmall Sketch Wallet sketches by @kactiguy\nPLAY\n\nMedium Sketch Wallet sketches by @etheringtonbrothers\n    Medium Sketch Wallet sketch by @drydenart\nSmall Sketch Wallet drawing by @anthony_holden\n        Medium Sketch Wallet drawing by @robbmommaerts\nSmall Sketch Wallet drawing by @manleycartoonist\nMedium Sketch Wallet drawing by @ajvilar\nSmall Sketch Wallet drawing by @sornigrafix\nMedium Sketch Wallet drawing by @theanimatedlife\nSmall Sketch Wallet drawing by @munoa13\nMedium Sketch Wallet drawing by @pumbaaguy\nMedium Sketch Wallet drawing by @camkendell\nWhy Kickstarter?\nKickstarter is an amazing platform to see if people actually want what you're making before you waste a bunch of money making thousands of products and then see if people like it. We pitch it to the Kickstarter community and let you decide if it's worth making. Why should you pledge now instead of just waiting until it's available online? Kickstarter backers will have theirs first. We won't make them available to the rest of the world until the Kickstarter backers have theirs. The other big reason is this year we're throwing in a pack of refill books free with each Sketch Wallet. You won't be seeing this deal online. So if you want yours first and with a free pack of refill books, pledge now!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs much as I'd like to pretend there are no risks, there are.

Or in the warband of any ambitious Warlord seeking fame and fortune gold and glory!\nLike walking piles of muscle held together by leather and chains and random plates of battered metal, the barbarian flings himself into the fray frothing at the mouth and shouting unintelligible obscenities. God knows they tend to die a lot so you'll need a lot of them.....so here we are!\nRed Box Games makers of awesomely designed, exquisitely sculpted and expertly cast fine fantasy 28mm scale miniatures is very proud to present!!\nWARBANDS OF WRATH AND RUIN\nWith your generous support we hope to fund the production of a series of new, finely detailed and beautifully sculpted, expertly produced,\" 28 mm \" scale barbarian miniatures which are the initial warband starter set for an all new small scale skirmish game set in a brutal, fallen fantasy world ruled by capricious Living Gods and beset by the ravages of their eternal war for survival and supremacy. The rules for the game are not quite ready for print yet but it is the goal of this campaign to fund this initial set of figures which will help us to also afford to finish the rules and get the production process for the rules and game components started.\nIn the game, Players take on the role of a powerful characters of super human or preternatural nature called \" Chosen \" in command of a small band of followers of various role and ability. These warbands , referred to in game as the \" Following \" expand in number and diversity as the Warlord grows in Power, Repute, Fortune and Favor of the Gods beginning in number between 6 and 9 followers, but growing to include as many as 24 followers at the Apex of the Chosen's Stature.\nFOLLOWERS\nThese followers may be lowly slaves, cultists, warriors, champions, and even monsters. But the core of any Chosen's following are the foot warriors.\nFOOT WARRIORS\nThe foot warriors are the most basic type of warrior follower. They are sparely equipped and basically trained and able. They are non specific to the character of their Chosen and can be of many different races or creature types but the first set of Foot Warriors we want to fund are the Human foot warriors. Rippling muscle and ready to slay in the name of any Chosen whose coin can fill their bowl or whose stature warrants following. \nPictured here still somewhat WIP these figures are semi modular for VERY expansive customization options and are cast in a very high quality lead free white metal. All modular fittings will be made in such a way as to insure easy secure assembly.\nThe items included in the pack are;\n10 barbarian foot warrior head / helm options\n6 right hand weapon options\n3 heavy weapon options\n3 heavy weapon foot warrior bodies\n5 weapon and shield foot warrior bodies\nAll this in one set for $40.00!! High quality, finely detailed metal minis for $5.00 Each!\n SOLOS\nSolos include both the companions and the Chosen themselves. These are the characters of the stories with the companions acting as a supporting role to the Chosen. Please note that any one of the foot warriors can be selected as a Solo option. \nPRIESTESS\nThe Priestess is a companion follower who serves as an intermediary between the Chosen and one of the Patron Gods of the world. Each Priestess is different and their uses can vary wildly based on the particular choices made during the creation of the character for use in the game but rest assured in this game a Chosen without some sort of spiritual aid is a Chosen set upon an arduous path.\nPictured here as a WIP the Priestess will be available in 2 different forms. One unclad and one half clad. The image above represents her unclad form. Her clad form will be slightly more modest.\nBackers can add additional copies of the Priestess to their existing pledge for an additional $8 per copy desired.\nBackers can also pledge for the Priestess figure ONLY if they so choose for $8 per copy desired.\nLESSER CHOSEN\nCurrently still WIP the Chosen will be finished very soon!\nThe Chosen are the scions of the Gods. Born from any strata of denizen in the realms these few are half mortal and half God, able to draw upon the ethereal energies of the cosmos to fuel superhuman feats of strength, speed, skill or to perform miraculous manipulations of the world around them. They can be man or woman marked by the touch of divinity with strange colored skin, hair, eyes, super human, or inhuman build or feature.\n Backers can add additional copies of Chosen to their existing pledge for an additional $8 per copy desired.\n Backers can also pledge for the Chosen figure(s) ONLY if they so choose for $8 per copy desired.\nPLEDGES\n As the funding allows I WILL add more options to the campaign. These will include Chosen of different nature to lead the Foot Warriors and companions of different role and nature to aid these Chosen in their quest for power, survival, glory, favor and fortune. I do not anticipate being able to add other foot warrior types to this campaign BUT I DO have plans for other various types of foot warrior to expand the range of theme of the game through future campaigns if this campaign does not reach a level of funding to allow them to be added during this campaign.\nBackers are free to add as many sets of foot warrior as they desire. This is accomplished by simply managing the amount of their pledge upward by enough value to cover multiple sets.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nIt is our hope to be able to expand the total offering of this campaign to include Chosen and Companions of different character such as an Amazon, a Mutant, a Beast Man, and a Hoplite, as well as a Sorceror, Sorceress, Priestess and Mystic as well as different head options for the Human foot warriors, and possibly other foot warrior themes as well! We can only do this as funding allows however and we will need to cover the costs of each new addition BEFORE it is a selectable add-on or substitution.\nPRODUCTION\nWe have been producing miniatures in metal and resin for a long time..... 10 years actually. And in that time we have established strong stable partnerships with some of the best contractors in the industry. This project will be handled by one of those awesome professionals as well insuring promptly delivered awesomeness so that you can get started playing your games while the excitement is still fresh! This contractor is VERY well established in the industry having delivered in a timely fashion to high levels of quality on several very large products including many of my own Kickstarter projects. Their system of manufacture is very well tested and efficient to make sure that delivery is handled swiftly. And being based in the US this means no lengthy delays in delivery, and no unexpected complications in that process.\nSHIPPING\nWe will not accept any payment for postage through the kickstarter. So please be aware that all of the money you add to your pledge WILL be applied to a reward selection and NOT to the postage needed to cover the shipment of your rewards. I have learned the hard way several times that trying to predict the postage costs of rewards packages can very easily become a serious problem. \nYou will be billed for postage during the pledge manager phase of fulfillment which will be very shortly before delivery commences. We work to keep the postage costs as low as possible and we will be certain that your rewards are securely packaged so as to avoid any damage in transit.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have been working in the miniatures industry since 2006 and have been operating my own business producing miniatures since 2008. In that time I have produced several hundred different unique figures and shipped thousands of packages around the world. I have also established very close working relationships with several of the best contractors in the business.\nThere are always certain risks in any production but I feel that with my experience and relationships I can confidently say there is very minimal risk involved in this kickstarter due to the sheer amount of experience I have in making minis and the reliability and experience of my casting contractor. There may be certain fixes needed for optimal casting of the figures and there may be production delays as these fixes are made. If the project's scope grows beyond the initial offering it could also result in further delays as all fo the product is readied for delivery. The most reasonable risk I could assume worth being worries about would be a delay in postage or a sudden drastic increase in postage costs. An Increase in postage costs is VERY unlikely though as the time frame between funding and delivery on this project will be very short.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 8 or more", "title": "SOLO", "descp": "This pledges rewards backers with their choice of any one (1) Solo figure successfully funded over the course of this campaign.\n\nBackers may add more items to this reward by managing the value of their pledge upward by whatever amount is needed to cover the desired additions.\n\nplease see the campaign pitch section for the specific details of which figures are designated as Solos.\nAll of these figures will be cast in high quality lead free white metal.\nPostage will NOT be collected during the campaign.

Or in the warband of any ambitious Warlord seeking fame and fortune gold and glory!\n Like walking piles of muscle held together by leather and chains and random plates of battered metal the barbarian flings himself into the fray frothing at the mouth and shouting unintelligible obscenities. God knows they tend to die a lot so you'll need a lot of them.....so here we are!\nRed Box Games makers of awesomely designed, exquisitely sculpted and expertly cast fine fantasy 28mm scale miniatures is very proud to present!!\nWARBANDS OF WRATH AND RUIN\nWith your generous support we hope to fund the production of a series of new high quality, finely detailed and beautifully sculpted, expertly produced DURABLE and SUPPLE RESIN cast \" 28 mm \" scale barbarian miniatures which are the initial warband starter set for an all new small scale skirmish game set in a brutal, fallen fantasy world ruled by capricious Living Gods and beset by the ravages of their eternal war for survival and supremacy. The rules for the game are not quite ready for print yet but it is the goal of this campaign to fund this initial set of figures which will help us to also afford to finish the rules and get the production process for the rules and game components started.\nIn the game Players take on the role of a powerful characters of super human or preternatural nature called \" Chosen \" in command of a small band of followers of various role and ability. These warbands , referred to in game as the \" Following \" expand in number and diversity as the Warlord grows in Power, Repute, Fortune and Favor of the Gods beginning in number between 6 and 9 followers, but growing to include as many as 24 followers at the Apex of the Chosen's Stature.\nThese followers may be lowly slaves, cultists, warriors, champions, and even monsters. But the core of any Chosen's following are the foot warriors.\nFOOT WARRIORS\nThe foot warriors are the most basic type of warrior follower. They are sparely equipped and basically trained and able. They are non specific to the character of their Chosen and can be of many different races or creature types but the first set of Foot Warriors we want to fund are the Human foot warriors. Rippling muscle and ready to slay in the name of any \nThe foot warriors are the most basic type of warrior follower. They are sparely equipped and basically trained and able. They are non specific to the character of their Chosen and can be of many different races or creature types but the first set of Foot Warriors we want to fund are the Human foot warriors. Rippling muscle and ready to slay in the name of any\nThese figures are semi modular for VERY expansive customization options and are cast in a very high quality DURABLE RESIN that is VERY similar in feel and nature to HIPS but with the detail fidelity of Resin. We are VERY excited about this.\nThe items included in the pack are;\n10 Human Warrior head / helm options\n8 right hand weapon options ( 2 clubs, 2 swords, 1 spear, 2 axes, 1 javelin )\n4 heavy / long weapon options ( 1 spear, 1 club, 1 sword, 1 axe )\n5 weapon and shield warrior bodies\n1 weapon and javelin warrior body\n2 heavy weapon warrior bodies\n2 long weapon warrior bodies\nAll this in one set for $55.00!! High quality, finely detailed resin minis for $5.50 Each!\nPRIESTESS\nThe Priestess a companion follower who serves as an intermediary between the Chosen and one of the Patron Gods of the world. Each Priestess is different and their uses can vary wildly based on the particular choices made during the creation of the character for use in the game but rest assured in this game a Chosen without some sort of spiritual aid is a Chosen set upon an arduous path.\nThe Priestess is an automatic addition to any \" Foot Warriors \" pledge and is available in two different forms; Unclad ( pictured above ) and half clad ( not yet pictured ). Her Unclad form is kickstarter exclusive and will not be available outside of the kickstarter. Backers will be able to select which form of figure they want to receive as part of their rewards in the pledge manager phase of the fulfillment.\nBackers can add additional copies of the Priestess to their existing pledge for an additional $8 per copy desired.\nBackers can also pledge for the Priestess figure ONLY if they so choose for $8 per copy desired.\nPLEDGES\nTo keep the campaign simple there is only one pledge level available from the outset of the campaign. As the funding allows I WILL add more options to the campaign. These will include Chosen of different nature to lead the Foot Warriors and companions of different role and nature to aid these Chosen in their quest for power, survival, glory, favor and fortune. I do not anticipate being able to add other foot warrior types to this campaign BUT I DO have plans for other various types of foot warrior to expand the range of theme of the game.\nBackers are free to add as many sets of foot warrior as they desire. This is accomplished by simply managing the amount of their pledge upward by enough value to cover multiple sets.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nIt is our hope to be able to expand the total offering of this campaign to include Chosen and Companions of different character such as an Amazon, A Mutant, a Beast Man, and a Hoplite, as well as a Sorceror, Sorceress, Priestess and Mystic as well as different head options for the Human foot warriors, and possibly other foot warrior themes as well! We can only do this as funding allows however and we will need to cover the costs of each new addition BEFORE it is a selectable add-on or substitution.\nPRODUCTION\nWe have been producing miniatures in metal and resin for a long time..... 10 years actually. And in that time we have established strong stable partnerships with some of the best contractors in the industry. This project will be handled by one of those awesome professionals as well insuring promptly delivered awesomeness so that you can get started playing your games while the excitement is still fresh! This contractor is VERY well established in the industry having delivered in a timely fashion to high levels of quality on several very large products. Their system of manufacture is very well tested and efficient to make sure that delivery is handled swiftly. And being based in the US this means no lengthy delays in delivery, and no unexpected complications in that process.\nSHIPPING\nWe will not accept any payment for postage through the kickstarter. So please be aware that all of the money you add to your pledge WILL be applied to a reward selection and NOT to the postage needed to cover the shipment of your rewards. I have learned the hard way several times that trying to predict the postage costs of rewards packages can very easily become a serious problem. \nYou will be billed for postage during the pledge manager phase of fulfillment which will be very shortly before delivery commences. We work to keep the postage costs as low as possible and we will be certain that your rewards are securely packaged so as to avoid any damage in transit.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have been working in the miniatures industry since 2006 and have been operating my own business producing miniatures since 2008. In that time I have produced several hundred different unique figures and shipped thousands of packages around the world. I have also established very close working relationships with several of the best contractors in the business.\n\n There are always certain risks in any production but I feel that with my experience and relationships I can confidently say there is very minimal risk involved in this kickstarter due to the sheer amount of experience I have in making minis and the reliability and experience of my casting contractor. There may be certain fixes needed for optimal casting of the figures and there may be production delays as these fixes are made. If the project's scope grows beyond the initial offering it could also result in further delays as all fo the product is readied for delivery. The most reasonable risk I could assume worth being worries about would be a delay in postage or a sudden drastic increase in postage costs. An Increase in postage costs is VERY unlikely though as the time frame between funding and delivery on this project will be very short.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "tre manor\n17 created \u00b7 57 backed\nI am a sculptor of table top miniature figures for fantasy gaming.

Also for JUST $40.00 USD.\n     See? Not much math stuff, lots of Orcs and Goblins. Who needs them book learnin talkie times anyways? Not Gobbers and Orcsies don't.\n     It is our hope that as the campaign progresses we can add items to the offering and perhaps to the initial box contents as well HOWEVER as this is our first effort in plastic manufacturing we want to be sure we are responsible and take this slowly keeping everything nice and predictable and efficiently produced and delivered. So there will only be a few additions to this campaigns. We don't want to get too ahead of ourselves with promises but we also want to make sure we make the most of this campaign that we can. You CAN NOT go wrong with more and more monstrous beasties eh?\n\n    Please be aware you can buy as many of these boxes as you want! Personally I don't think any orc or goblin warband is complete unless it nearly breaks the shelves under it's ponderous weight when stowed away between sessions of rampaging blood thirst. \n   If you want to add to your rewards you can do so by managing the amount of your pledge upward by enough to cover the addition of as many green hellions your heart desires. \n  And remember a forest without goblins under every hedge is just not a forest worth trodding through for any self respecting adventurer!

They DESERVE awesome enemies to fight! the theatre of your imagination DESERVES fantastic minis! YOU. NEED. THE HORDES OF THE AULD WORLD ORCS AND GOBLINS BOXED SET!!\n   The whole idea of this kickstarter is to fund the production of these fantastic monstrosities in high detail hard grade PVC plastic similar to many of the newly beloved board games recently hitting the market like a spiked ball of steel in the gnarly green fist of a feral Orc berserker rampaging through the ranks of silly tights wearing doods who spend all their time preening their poofy feathered hats and shining their armor and dancing with their little swishy poke \" swords \" and singing songs about damsels and wine and stupid stuff. Do we really want those kinds of doods in charge of stuff and ruining our good time? No. No we do not. We want Orcs and goblins. Lots of them. That is why plastic is good; cause we can make a LOT of them and sell them cheap.\n\n  So to help us do this well we need your help to allow us to pay the high cost of plastic production with tried and true manufacturers who have produced many of these exact same great boxed game projects.\n   Ok this is serious. Shipping is important and can be costly depending upon where in the world you need your stuff to be delivered to. Because we do not know exactly when the project will complete production we cannot bill for postage until the product is actually in hand and ready to deliver. We are working to build a base frame of reference for the shipping costs and we are also working to establish relationships that may allow us to ship from hubs in various parts of the world to mitigate those costs. \n   We will work to keep the postage costs as low as possible cause we don't really want to make money from shipping we just want to get your stuff to you as soon as possible cause once you know you have orcs and goblins on the way.... well they just need to get there fast and cheap right? \n   For now though the only region in which we can reasonably project postage costs is the US. We will be shipping orders via priority mail so as long as your stuff fits into a priority box ( and we will be working to make sure that they do ) you can expect to pay the priority mail shipping rates.\nAnd Say!

Kickstarter has enabled a renascence in miniatures by allowing manufacturers to appeal directly to their fan base. With the success of our Kickstarters, we were able to have several more figures sculpted, printed and put into production than we initially planned. The funding level directly affects the expansion of the range with our backers literally funding our efforts with their venture capital. What better way to participate in creating the miniatures you want while supporting the hobby we love?", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere is practically no chance of this project not being fulfilled once the successful funding level is reached. Fortress Figures is one of the oldest professional miniatures production companies with more than three decades of experience casting the finest white metal miniatures with capabilities for casting several thousand figures per day. All molding and casting is done in house by our dedicated staff of three well experienced individuals. Only the sculpting is outsourced and the sculpting portion of the project is already completed. We have again, allowed ourselves what we consider to be an extraordinarily abundant amount of time to complete this project. We have, so far, completed 9 Kickstarter projects and a 10th project on track for completion before the end of this campaign. A quick look at our previous Kickstarters will show that we shipped rewards to backers well ahead of schedule. We believe we have a 100% backer satisfaction record after nine successful kickstarters and a 10th one in process. We're not perfect but if a problem does arise we do our honest best to resolve any issues.\n\nAn unforeseen event, though unlikely, could be, well, unforeseen.

They had been curious of course, and there was much speculation as to what was on the other side, but as the hill had been inhabited by Gnomes who didn't take kindly to such impudent questions, the matter was largely left alone.\nNow, seemingly in the middle of the night, the gnomes have disappeared, and the big question (apart from where have all the gnomes gone) of what lies on the other side of the hill is now very much the talk of the town.  Some think it might be an orchard, full of apples.  Others, that a very big dragon has eaten all the gnomes and may well be coming for them next.\nThe Halfling Town Council declared an emergency meeting, and decided there's only one way to be sure - an adventure.  Under such dire circumstances, they are seeking brave (or at least moderately confident) adventurers, from different backgrounds to form a Party (the very worst kind, without cake or even paper hats) to investigate the other side of the hill...\nNinjas in the Pantry - Stretch Goal Unlocked!\nWe are very pleased to announce that we have made our stretch goal to unlock the Halfling Ninja class!  Once again, we are indebted to you for your fantastic support.\nWhile we don't have a second stretch-goal planned, in order to keep the Kickstarter manageable, should we pas \u00a310,000 we will endevour to come up with a mystery reward for backers of the full pledge.\nThe Way of the Mini-Ninja! - Stretch Goal Announced\nSo far, the Halfling Town Council had interviewed a motley collection of individuals from all walks of life and professions.  It had been decided however, that eager though the bakers were, they were far too vital to the town to risk, and that something else was needed. At that moment, from out of the shadows of the room, two totally silent black-clad figures triple back-flipped into the interview chairs.\n\"And you are...\"\nAs suggested by one of our loyal customers, we present a male and female halfling ninja from one of the more obscure character classes. \nShould we reach \u00a37000, then we will include one of each miniature free with every Halfling Lady and Gentlemen Adventurers pledge, and the appropriate one free with each Ladies or Gentlemen Adventurers pledge.  Backers who pledge for a single or double miniature set will be able to choose one of these miniatures as one of their options.\nMidlam Miniatures are pleased to present a collection of sixteen 28mm scale halfling miniatures for use in all of your fantasy games.\nChoosing Your Class\nWe have chosen a range of different character classes for the 'A Class of Their Own' Kickstarter, which we hope will help flesh out your fantasy adventures. However, while we couldn't include all the possible choices in the campaign, we will consider any suggestions for a follow up Kickstarter in the future, should this Kickstarter is successful.  Please leave any suggestions (from the obvious to the obscure) in the comments page!\nAbout Midlam Miniatures and Our Kickstarters \nThis is our ninth Kickstarter, and we are using it to help develop and extend our range of miniatures, in this case, halflings! \nWe have been very grateful to all the support we have received in the past and hope you will join us on our latest project. Our eight previous Kickstarters - Wizard Apprentices, Wizard Halflings, Cultists of the Kraken Lord, Servants of the Undead Pharaoh, Halfling Adventures, Winter Adventurers, Common or Garden Gnomes and the Ghosts of Midlam Manor have all successfully funded.\nA Note on Metal\nThe miniatures are cast in a high quality pewter, with a high Tin content, but may contain a small quantity of lead. We unfortunately cannot guarantee lead free models. Most 'lead free' metal usually contains a small amount of lead to help the metal flow into the mould. \nAnticipated Delivery Date\nThe delivery date of July 2018, is our shipping date, rather than an arrival date. As we ship all over the world, delivery times will vary considerably, even within the same countries.

Thrall and Brute\nSpetznaz Greens are Done\n The US mech armed with pile driver and grenade launcher will have this frame.  \nPLAY\n\nUS and Russian Mechs\nRussian Mechs\nUS Mechs\nHello Kickstarter Patrons,\nWe at Impulse Miniatures are looking to kick start our first miniature game \"The Evolved\".  This 28mm mech focused game gives you control over mechs, infantry vehicles and The Evolved.  The game play is fast paced, full of tactics, and strategy.  The setting is based in the modern day with some futuristic advancements.  Players can look to see modern day weapons and vehicle designs.  The story is something new that we believe players will find fresh and intense, and we can\u2019t wait to share it with you.\nAfter the Kickstarter we will continue to produce models for the 3 armies and have another army in the works. There are several additional units currently planned for each army.  The US army has an infantry team with large caliber sniper rifle, anti tank gun team, and anti infantry gun team. For US mechs, an anti infantry mech, a leader only mech, and a close quarters mech with pile driver.  For the Russians, a heavy cannon team, RPG team, and mortar team.  For the Russian mechs, a riot shield and shotgun armed mech, leader mech, and one armed with high explosive rockets.  The evolved will gain a heavy armored infantry unit, an infantry unit with ranged weapon, a faster moving large creature, and one with ranged.  These will be added as additional stretch goals if the kickstarter reaches all of the current stretch goals.  All of the current stretch goals and the ones mentioned above are in the rule book, and will be included in the pdf rules sent to all backers.  A printed rule book will be available shortly after the kickstarter as well.  \nThe evolved are humans that have the ability to control nanite swarms.  After being experimented on by scientists from the US, they broke free.  In their wake they left cities in ruins.  They lead armies of humans that  have been taken over by the nanites.  The nanites change the humans from the inside out.  The evolved brutes are formed from the melding of nanites with larger beasts and in other cases several human hosts.  They are the wrecking balls of the evolved armies.  The evolved have also learned how to use nanites to take control of mechs whose pilots have been killed but are otherwise still operable.  They are less accurate and agile, but provide  needed ranged attacks to the evolved armies.  The evolved army is a swarm army with powerful technomancers able to deal damage and heal thanks to their nanite abilities.  \nSo far we have the US, and Russian Mechs completed and ready for production. This Kickstarter will be funding the infantry and expansions. This is just the beginning of The Evolved universe with many more units and models planned for the future!  Our manufacturer is US based and used by many other companies with a proven track record.  \nThank you for being apart of our Kickstarter and helping us to bring The Evolved to life.\nSTRETCH GOALS!!!!\n$8500 \nRussian Mech with Howitzer\nRussian Howitzer\nUS Mech with High Caliber Rifle\nUS Heavy Rifle\n $10,000- \n-US Stingray variant armed with pile driver and grenade launcher\n-Russian Black Bear Variant armed with riot shield and automatic shotgun\n$12,000\n- US Infantry Heavy Armor Squad.

Evolved Leaders are strong technomancers able to control swarms of nanites, transforming fallen enemies into servants of their wil, interfering with the systems of enemy mechs, and even creating brutes from fallen enemies and nanite swarms.  \nThis is the first miniature for the evolved, and to celebrate every backer will receive this model for free.\n$18000\n-The Evolved infantry.  Assimilation of human and nanites, these creatures serve the will of the Technomancers.  They are quick, able to heal damage and deadly up close.  \n$20000\n-The Evolved Brute.  Massive creatures created by the technomancers.  They tower at over 10 feet tall.  Metallic protrusions, incredible strength, ability to heal wounds.  They are horrendous creatures to encounter in the field.  Able to tear a mech apart with brute strength.  \n$25000\n-To celebrate the initial models for The Evolved miniatures game being funded, Every backer will receive a Kickstarter only SGT Jack Savage Model.\n$30,000\n-The Evolved Corrupted mech.  The strongest technomancers are able to overcome mechs and their pilots taking control of the mech and corrupting it to their will.  These are less accurate and responsive than normal mechs, but provide much needed ranged support to the evolved armies.  \n$35,000\n-Japanese Mech.  Japanese mechs are the most nimble and agile of the mechs.  The have the most overdrive points of all the mechs, and the highest evasion roll.  \n$37,500\n-Japanese Infantry.  The Japanese infantry are the most trained and tech focused of all the countries.  They make heavy use of sub machine guns and guerrilla tactics.

Digitally rendered by Master Sculptor Tim Hill and faithfully brought to physical reality by Fortress Figures using cutting edge technology to bring you the unquestionably highest quality metal miniature available today.    \nThe Sauracens fled the extinction wrought by the planetary cataclysm of their home world in the forgotten epoch shrouded by the mists of eons past. Civilization for Sauracens has risen to celestial heights and fallen to their archaic origins many times as their knowledge ebbs and flows as with the cycles of the great celestial mechanism. Those retaining knowledge of archaic technologies still travel the stars searching for the mythical home of their origin to which they are instinctively as a species driven to return. As the navigator/priests identify each newly discovered planet, they pray to the celestial consciences that the long lost home of their origin will finally be rediscovered and bring some peace to the wander lust they have not yet managed to suppress.\nMETALS\n This project is for unpainted, white metal figurines. Models are provided NOT painted. Models are scaled to 28mm toe to eye or 1:60. Models are provided with a plastic tab/slot base. White metal figurines are not toys and are intended only for adults. Models may require some assembly, may have sharp or pointed parts and are a choking hazard to anyone prone to put them in their mouth.\nSCALE COMPARISON\n  PLEDGE LEVELS\n  GRENADIER SQUAD\n  SAURACEN RAIDERS\n  STRETCH GOALS\n  $1500 STRETCH GOAL\n  WHATS NEXT\n  ADD ONS\n  SET ADD ONS\n  SHIPPING\nOn the end of the campaign, each backer will be issued a coupon code via e-mail to redeem at our on-line store for your pledge rewards.

Kickstarter has enabled a renascence in miniatures by allowing manufacturers to appeal directly to their fan base. With the success of our Kickstarters, we were able to have several more figures sculpted, printed and put into production than we initially planned. The funding level directly affects the expansion of the range with our backers literally funding our efforts with their venture capital. What better way to participate in creating the miniatures you want while supporting the hobby we love?\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere is practically no chance of this project not being fulfilled once the successful funding level is reached. Fortress Figures is one of the oldest professional miniatures production companies with more than three decades of experience casting the finest white metal miniatures with capabilities for casting several thousand figures per day. All molding and casting is done in house by our dedicated staff of three well experienced individuals. Only the sculpting is outsourced and the sculpting portion of the project is already completed. We have again, allowed ourselves what we consider to be an extraordinarily abundant amount of time to complete this project. We have, so far, completed 5 Kickstarter projects and a 6th project on track for completion before the end of this campaign. A quick look at our previous Kickstarters will show that we shipped rewards to backers well ahead of schedule. We believe we have a 100% backer satisfaction record after five successful kickstarters and a 6th one in process. We're not perfect but if a problem does arise we do our honest best to resolve any issues.\n\nAn unforeseen event, though unlikely, could be, well, unforeseen.

We have returned again to kickstarter in the hopes to fund our newest selection of fantasy norse figures that we call the Njorn. \n  Our intention is to fund the production of a new set of heroes and their faithful follower rank and file troops. We also intend to fund the set up of our in house production capacity! This means buying a spin caster, a smelter, all the various periphery of safe casting, metal shelves to hold molds ( LOTS of molds ) having our molds shipped to us from the various contractors we currently partner with, and raw metal to do the casting with. Being set up for in house production will allow us to reinvest in the various aspects that will make your experience with Red Box Games more efficient and better presented, as well as allow us to manage our working capital MUCH more efficiently.\n  We currently reinvest a disproportionate amount of our profits into maintaining reasonable stock levels across the entire breadth of the red box games line. This is a HUGE investment that grows every time we add new products to the line. It also means we have to rely on kickstarters much more because we simply cannot afford to just put new items in to the store without knowing that the funds are already there to pay for the production and stocking of said items.\n\n  Once set up for casting we will be able to keep the funds of the business' success where it belongs, in the future of the business. It also has the added advantage of allowing us to afford lower prices across the board and able to take chances on items which are too risky to produce through out sourcing such as larger monsters and cavalry and Rank and File sets appropriately priced for army building. \n\n  To insure that the high level of quality you have come to expect from Red Box Games is faithfully maintained, I will be training in casting with a VERY talented and experienced mold maker and caster. I wont be handling the entire burden of casting right away so there is no need to worry that this development will slow down delivery of the Kickstarter or the regular course of business for RBG.\n\n  My molds will continue to be made by one of the industry's best studios as well so there is no need to worry that the burden will overwhelm me or that the overall quality of the Red Box Games product will suffer.\n\n  I cannot do any of this without your help so please consider backing this kickstarter! You will get some really cool stuff for a GREAT price in a reasonable amount of time and I will FINALLY be able to set up for my own production and make some real progress in this industry!\n\n  AAAaaannndddd without further Adieu...... ON TO THE MINIATURES!!!\n We intend to fund as many figures as this kickstarter will allow and at the outset of the campaign we have 19 figures ready to go with a few slight details needing to be added before they are ready for production and I still have several more underway which will be shown as they are completed and added to the campaign as the funding allows. \n   Please se as follows for the full selection of miniatures offered in this campaign;\n  KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE!! Thorarnr the Storm Hammer!!\n  available as a free addition to all pledges of Warband or Alla Njorngarna but available as a selection option or $8 add-on as well!\n       Any of the miniatures shown above can be selected as singular selections. or the entire group can be selected. \n Backers can pledge for an entire warband ( 25 figures in total as of the launch of the campaign ) cast in high quality white metal, or pick and choose individual figures from the selection funded by this campaign.\nHERO ..................This pledge level rewards backers with 1 copy of any one of the figures successfully funded through this campaign cast in high quality white metal.\nCOUNCIL....... This pledge rewards backers with their choice of any 10 figures funded through this kickstarter campaign.\nWAR BAND ..............This pledge rewards backers with their choice of any 25 figures funded through this campaign.\nALLA NJORNGARNA........This pledge rewards backers with one copy of each of the figures funded through this campaign AND one copy of each of the figures currently offered in the red Box Games Njorn back catalogue, including also a few of the recently OOP models as well. \n      All figures will be produced in high quality lead free white metal.\n    Most figures will be cast in a single piece. However some figures may need to be cast in multiple parts to allow for the most reliable casting. These figures will also be cast in high quality lead free white metal as well.\n All packages will be shipped in BOXES rather than envelopes with any appropriate extra packaging needed to insure your rewards are delivered perfectly intact. It is my hope to also be able to invest in some fancy schmancy marketing materials and snazzy packaging to go in with your beautiful Red Box games minis.\nAll packages will be fullfilled from the United States. Postage will be collected within the kickstarter pledge. However it is not always possible to predict when / if postage costs increase to deliver to foreign countries. As a result we must reserve the right to bill for any additional postage needed to cover the shipment of your rewards. We do not try to profit from the postage of our packages and will always keep the cost of delivery exactly in line with the actual costs.\n For those who are unfamiliar with me as a sculptor and with my business red box games I am a sculptor of finely detailed 28mm scale fantasy miniatures. Most often specializing in minis of a Norse theme. I founded my business in 2008 and have been producing miniatures ever since. In that time I have produced some 300 odd figures for my various ranges of Men, Elves, Dwarves, Goblins, Halflings, Orcs, Demons, and Undead of all kind of role for each of those range themes. I have now run 7 kickstarters and have fully delivered on 7.

Lead the sinister Wretched Hive in a dangerous criminal underground, or find yourself entangled in the strange motives of the inscrutable Wilderkin.\nThe Wretched Hive Kickstarter campaign offers the opportunity to add amazing new characters to Relicblade. New Faction Sets not only present the chance to expand the game, but also offer a great entry point for new players. The Wretched Hive Kickstarter campaign promises to deliver all-new factions, characters, unit types, upgrades, and powerful magic spells. These faction sets have been meticulously designed to add exciting new play-styles to Relicblade!\nGet both of the new expansions and eight incredible metal miniatures with the recommended Bold Adventurer pledge level!\n The Wretched Hive\nIn The Wretched Hive we delve into the sinister underworld that exists on the fringes of society.\nThe iguan are a ubiquitous reptilian race whose myths claim a primordial origin predating all human civilization. The pragmatic iguan do not build cities of their own, but rather opt to live in nomadic groups operating with a network of semi-permanent encampments on the outskirts of large cities. Traveling bands will meet to trade with the settled iguan, who in turn offer goods and services to the wider markets. \nDue to their peculiar psychology many iguan find full integration into civilized life distasteful and traditionally work as laborers and sailors. They never shy from dangerous work, and take special pride in their ability to endure. Despite the obvious value of strong workers, the complex cruelty of civilization has branded the iguan as the lowest class. Merchants gain hordes of wealth while the workers struggle to survive. \nIn the absence of true justice, following the law is a luxury few can afford. Thus we enter the vile black markets of the Wretched Hive. Where cruelty is the law and only the strong survive. \nThe slave trade is perhaps the most depraved of the black market practices. The legality of slavery may vary from kingdom to kingdom, but legal status only truly changes how public the slave auctions are. \nThe Iguan Slavers are powerful fighters and bitter task masters.These depraved individuals offer harsh motivation to their comrades in brutal fashion. Slavers are rightly feared for the sinister depths of their inhumanity.\nPoachers are almost universally nomadic in origin. Many ply their humble, if illegal, trade as hunters. However, in the harsh depths of the black market, not every poachable entity is a beast.\nThe brutal wilderness takes its toll on nomadic tribes. In the harshest seasons many poachers turn their unmatched skill as scouts and trackers to the benefit of dangerous crime lords. With highly valuable skills and keen javelins, these deadly warriors are rightly prized.\nAccording to their customs a select few are chosen and groomed from birth to assume a terrible duty. The elder crone prepares these youth for many years. Until the fateful day they must read from the unpronounceable black pages of agog. The black pages tether the iguan to their primordial gods. As the chosen study the dizzying passages their inner minds are assailed by terrible dimensions beyond reality. \nSadly, many are utterly consumed by madness. Those who survive are honored and assume their place as iguan witches. These witches are respected councilors and powerful sorcerers. They peer into the void to observe the threads of fate, command plagues, and call upon the boiling depths of the earth. These powerful women form an integral core of iguan political and religious society.\nNomadic iguan have formed strange alliances in their bid for survival. One such partnership is with a the mangrove basilisk. A long snouted sub-species endemic to the brackish badlands.\nThese cold-blooded beasts have a near super-natural hypnotic gaze and are extremely venomous. The Iguan Witches made connections with the beasts and have used them as powerful assets for generations. These pitiless creatures grant an exotic edge to an iguan fighting force. They paralyze combatants as swift warriors descend upon their ill-fated foe.\nThe Wilderkin\nWilderkin is a broad term describing individuals of fay ancestry. Elves, while rare, are the most common in settled society. However, the term Wilderkin is often reserved for more conspicuous outlanders.\nIt is generally believed that the fay realm and ours were more closely tied in ancient times. In the terrible cataclysm known as the sundering, when great empires were brought low and from which there is only a faint hope of recovery, the relationship between realms was irrevocably changed. In this new and unstable landscape the otherworldly races adapted in strange and marvelous ways. From the peculiar gnomes to the indomitable stonekin, the Wilderkin abide by their inscrutable ways.\nGnomes are largely unchanged by our changed world. Gnome interactions have always been centered on their fanatical devotion to craft. These pint-sized hobbyists have only the slightest concern for the greater world. They are even known to forget entirely the plight of our modern age! Instead they focus with razor precision on mastery of a given craft. \nGnomes are still intimately tied to the fay realm and may even travel between worlds. Accordingly they are visitors with minor alliances to a select few. It seems their primary endeavor in our world is to explore their passions. Once a gnome fixates on a craft they are utterly obsessed. They may be captivated by anything from shoe-making to the most complex alchemical sciences.\nDue to their tiny stature, gnomes rarely travel without an animal companion. They have been seen riding everything from common mountain goats to exotic creatures only imagined in the most obscure folklore.\nThe stonekin were elves once. In the tumultuous years when civilization collapsed a sect of mystical artisans took extreme measures to survive. In desperation they placed irreversible enchantments on their families, forever changing their bodies to lifeless stone.\nWith a faint hope the artisans went to work. Employing unknowably ancient secrets, once used to create marvels beyond reckoning, the artisans worked into the fading twilight of all civilization to finish their final masterpiece. The world burned, but the work was complete.\nThe stonekin were born. The artisans had saved their beloved people. A new race, half-elf and half-stone, arose. They were completely alive, not living statues or enchanted stone. The stonekin were reforged in the fires of a dying world, and emerged a race fit to survive in the coming dark age.\nThe Battleborn comfortably faces multiple combatants.\nMany stonekin live peaceful lives as farmers and artisans. However the brutality of the changed world demands certain concessions. The battleborn are a reserved caste of fearless warriors. They stand as the definition of stonekin fortitude and strength. The stonekin battleborn are imposing giants hardened for the rigors of battle.\nSummon explosive stone spires to smash your enemies.\nThe wild elves owe their earnest allegiance to nature and regarded the sundering as a natural shift. Embracing the chaotic heart of creation, the wild elves humbly adapted in the midst of mass extinction. They plunged themselves deeper into asceticism and immersed themselves in the changed environment. Some individuals became indistinguishable from nature itself.\nThe wild elf druids adopted powerful beast forms to live in brutal harmony with the wilderness, while the geomancers tap into surging rivers of energy that course through the earth. Embracing the wilderness, the geomancers enjoy a place of privilege in a chaotic world. Though they are wanderers in a savage wilderness, geomancers compose themselves in complex formalities and are utterly dedicated to the discipline of the earth. As servents of the enigmatic wilds, the geomancers often find themselves entangled in heroic endeavors.\nThe Wilderkin follow the serpentine paths of fate. Forever entangled in the intricate patterns of an altered world. For as the wind blows, life is chaos.\nRelicblade is a fantasy skirmish miniature game. Players command heroes or monsters as they battle to claim powerful magic relics lost in the ancient world. Players only need between three and six figures per side, and games only last about a half hour. The rules are simple and easy to learn, but there is a lot of depth in the available characters and upgrades.\nEnjoy an immersive hobby experience as you collect, build, and paint your miniatures. Relicblade models are made of white metal for wonderful crisp detail. Games take place on a two foot by two foot area, so creating detailed scenery is very manageable. While beautifully modeled terrain is a delight, you can play on any surface you have available by simply using stacks of books to represent the troubled wilds of Relicblade.\nDive into delightful tactical depths with each new game. Specialize your characters utilizing a vast arsenal of upgrade cards. Tactics, items, weapons, potions, and spells create a wonderful framework to customize each character in your war party. Faction sets include a booster pack of cards with new characters and upgrades, so as each new set is released the options continue to grow with dynamic new list-building options. In the example below this Iguan Slaver has a combination of defensive and ranged attack upgrades, which shifts his battlefield role and greatly increases his survivability. This particular build includes cards from The Wretched Hive, The Lone Guard, and Core Game Deck.\nCards from the new sets will be in full-color for your viewing pleasure!\nFor players interested in narrative campaign play, the Seeker's Handbook is packed with great content. Rather than simply selecting characters and upgrades based on a point total, you will construct a base and lead your characters as they undertake dangerous adventures to claim magical treasures. There are six scenarios, four environments, dangerous wild monsters, and rare treasures that pack each game with new dangers and unique challenges. The Seeker's Handbook is a wonderful source for limitless adventure. \nBattle Pigs personally congratulate the rangers on finding the lost relic!\nYou can learn a lot more about the game and how it's played on YouTube! There are gameplay overviews, unboxings, and battle reports ready to be consumed! Ash and Owen of Guerrilla Miniature Games and Gaming With The Cooler played a full Relicblade campaign on their channels. So check it out!\nChoose the pledge level that's right for you. Remember, by backing Relicblade you're helping it exist! Get ahold of this delightfully unique miniature game. Relicblade is 100% natural, pure, and unfiltered imagination that is bottled at the source. It is untouched by the sanitizing influence of a board-room or stock-holders. Enjoy the benefits of live and active gaming cultures.\nIf you're new to Relicblade the \"Champion of Adventure\" is AWESOME! At this mega-rad pledge level you'll get the core game along with the \"Wilderkin\" and \"The Wretched Hive\" expansions. This pledge level includes twenty one metal miniatures, the rulebook, tokens, dice, and 70+ unique cards including all kinds of amazing characters, magic swords, advanced battle tactics, and powerful ancient relics from time immemorial.\n What's a Custom Character Card?\nImagine the possibilities.\nYou tell me about a D&D character you used to play or any character you can imagine. Then I will do an original illustration of that character. But the fun won't stop there! I will also stick that character in a special COLOR character card and make up some sweet rules and stats for your them! The custom card will be your ideas collaboratively realized in Relicblade. You're welcome to create heroes, villains, relics, or monsters, whatever your heart desires.\nYou get the original illustration and copies of your character card along with the other Legends from this campaign. All ten custom character commissions will be collected in the \"Legends 2\" booster pack. This booster pack will be an official expansion for Relicblade for players to collect and enjoy. The first Legends set was extremely popular, so don't miss out on being part of a new generation of legends!\nIt is my earnest hope to raise enough money to produce the two faction sets above. But within the production timeline for this project I am happy to add a little wish-list in the form of stretch goals.\nStretch goals are a great way to boost the project outcomes as the budget increases. If we raise enough money to produce the new sets, then the money we continue to raise will push toward even more new content! Newly unlocked content will be available as Add-Ons once the goal is reached.\nGuest Artist: DARKWIZARD BERSERKER\nThe Relicblade: Guest Artist Series RETURNS!! I'm beyond excited to offer another off the wall collaboration. As the creator of Relicblade I enjoy unbridled creative freedom. This privilege is granted by my generous Kickstarter Backers, so in this campaign I hope to extend the mantle of creative power to a deserving guest artist!\nTriptych by Darkwizard\nScott Wygmans is known under the name Darkwizard_Berserker on Instagram. I almost feel like that's enough to get him the job, but he deserves it for more than a badass Fighting Fantasy name. His style is both absolutely brutal and undeniably fun. He's got one foot firmly planted in heavy metal dungeon badassery and the other cheerfully placed in a fun-loving world of adventure. It's precisely this balance of light hearted savagery that makes Scott the perfect fit for Relicblade.\nI particularly love collaborating with artists with loads of style. Scott manages to evoke hardcore nostalgia of classic pen and paper gaming while always delivering something completely fresh. I encourage you to dig deep into his portfolio and let your imagination reel. It's going to be a special delight to sculpt based on his work. Let's make this happen!\nThis is a gross wizard.\nNOTE: The Shadow Fox and Gnome Alchemist are separate characters who form a cavalry pair. Now with the Ibex and Battlesmith you'll be able to swap riders and mounts to explore new combinations. As more cavalry models are released there will be more fun options to explore. \nFate of The Firstborn\n        \"The First Born King once ruled a mighty empire. His fertile lands stretched far and wide from his island borne ziggurat. His armies marched and his navy sailed, bringing tribute from the conquered. His sorcerers and alchemists sought and distilled the secrets of life. His seers and soothsayers predicted the rise and fall of mighty kings, dynasties, and empires. But for all his power and knowledge, The First Born King could not save his own.\nThe Firstborn still skulk in their hidden tombs and foul fens to this day, silent guardians of the treasures of their ancient empire. Animated by foul magics, they have remained strong and aware despite the loss of their primitive humanity.\nNow, bold adventurers and dastardly villains scour The Fens of The Firstborn in search of ancient treasure and powerful relics. From the be-swamped port city of Fen\u2019s Moore, they set out into the murky frontier to find their fate and fortune.\nJoin them if you dare, but know that wherever you go, The Firstborn will be waiting.\"\nFate of The Firstborn is an all new expansion for Relicblade!\nJust look at how cool these are in the video below. The Ancient Waystones scenario requires players track which objectives have been activated this round, and the Braziers will play a significant role in upcoming Relicblade Adventures!\nThese paint up really nicely, too. They make wonderful additions to your tabletop.\nThe additional Stone Spire miniature will be extremely useful for playing the game. I realize that most of you have the hobby skills to make as many rocks as you need. But I think an extra spire miniature will make the Geomancer more playable right out of the package. :) \nALSO. I can't believe I'm writing a stretch goal for 30k. THANK YOU!!! \nThe add-on marketplace is a way to add a few extra items to your pledge. That way you can rest assured you are getting all the Relicblade goodness you can handle.\nI highly recommend that new players pick up a copy of The Seeker's Handbook. This book contains the full rules for Relicblade, along with the awesome campaign rules. Link your games into an ongoing narrative, claim rare treasures, and assail terrible monsters on your quest to claim the mighty RELICBLADE! You and a friend will be equipped to play a full campaign with this book and the Bold Adventurer pledge level.\nNOTE: All the non-stretch goal add-ons are presently available at Relicblade.com. So if you're excited about trying the game you should place an order to get shipped to you right away! These add-ons are of particular interest to my EU friends who have had their eye on these treasures but didn't want to deal with customs. \nmnmNOTE: The terrain featured in the photographs was hand built by our amazing studio staff (me :D ). It's mostly made out of painted insulation foam, however I must draw special attention to the rad dungeon terrain. For the dungeon I used materials and resin/metal accessories from Firedragon Games. I cannot recommend their products highly enough! I built my full dungeon in one day, and painted it all the next day.

Funds will go to the necessary development tools and time needed.\nChallenge Mode [REACHED!]\nWe'll have some extra resources to put towards a unique challenge mode! Put your Flynn skills to the test in the arena with survival and boss rush trials!\nAnimated Intro\nWe'll be able to work with our pals over at Studio Yotta to create an animated intro for Flynn: Son of Crimson! It'll be pretty and juicy and whoa!\nRozia Story DLC\nAn alternate character in a DLC story played alongside Flynn's journey! We already have this story planned out, these funds would help it become a reality! All backers receiving the game will get the DLC at no charge.\n  Flynn: Son of Crimson is a 2D action adventure platformer with metroidvania elements. Set in a wondrous world with a looming darkness beginning to awaken yet again.\nWhat can you expect?\nExplore a wondrous world filled with discovery, taking place in unique regions designed with non-linear exploration.\nSwap between multiple weapons with quick and satisfying combat.\nDive in to a land with ancient mysteries and rich story.\nTravel across the lands, discovering new ways to roam and opening new paths using the power of crimson.\nDip in and out of an alternate dimension to make unique alterations to the real world.\nView a realm full of life, carefully formed with hand-crafted pixel art.\nTrade trinkets for new combat techniques and runes with an old war veteran.\nCall on your companion Dex in times of need, a mystical and loyal creature.\nTest your strength in the feared Rustwood coliseum among other challenging feats.\nTake on the role of Flynn, a young man orphaned as a child who sets out to chase the shadows of his beginnings whilst awakening the ancient power of Crimson within him. \nDiscover relics of ancient Rosantica, effigies and monuments to the goddess Sorrell that reveal hints at Flynn\u2019s beginnings and unlock new powers. Reveal secret pathways, trade with villagers, battle fierce monsters, hang out with dogs.\n    What about the Switch?\nWe've received a lot of requests for the Switch, we hear you! We'd love to launch on as many platforms as possible, but there is a problem. Flynn is being created in Gamemaker Studio 2, which is a great engine, but it currently does not support porting to the Switch. If we were to go for it now, Flynn would have to be recreated in an entirely new engine, which as you can imagine is a lot of work. Just know that Yoyo games is working hard on trying to make a Switch port possible! We can set up a later stretch goal for a Switch port, but until then we'll have to hope for the port to become available during Flynn's development! We'll keep everyone updated as Yoyo games and Nintendo work it out.\n  From the very first stages of development, we began designing Flynn: Son of Crimson with fast paced, satisfying combat. We\u2019re strong believers that \u2018game feel\u2019 should be priority in any video game so we've been injecting as much juice as we can to make sure every hit packs a punch and feels extra tasty.\nTrade gems and trinkets acquired throughout the game to learn new techniques for Flynn\u2019s arsenal, and you\u2019ll soon find that you can figure out your own favourite combination of attacks (Smash, bash, tickle, tickle, bosh!). Designed with quick and easy weapon swapping in mind, you\u2019re never more than a button press away from your desired weapon so you better dispatch your foes with flair, else you\u2019re not the cool hero everyone thought! \nThe Crimson Blade, a staple in Flynn's arsenal (and the default starting weapon, but that doesn\u2019t sound as appealing!) is the first weapon of Crimson energy gifted to Flynn by the Goddess Sorrell in a great time of need. Unlocking and mastering the uppercut will provide some serious hang time to any foe that is on the receiving end. Or why not slice through many baddies with the piercing dash? Piece of cake.\nThe Crimson Axe demands precise timing and enemy prediction, trading the quick cuts of the crimson blade for a weighty windup, this axe packs a punch sure to leave your enemies as a smear on the floor. Use the axe to crush your enemy's shields, and smash brittle walls to access new areas with brute force. It\u2019s a wonder how the young one can lift this, but as we wrote this we realized it is made of energy, whoops.\nThe Crimson Claws, a swift and energetic set of weapons used to stagger enemies with high attack speed and air superiority, if that\u2019s your sort of thing. Unleash your inner wildcat with unique wall climbing (go home, Knuckles) and a spiral drill attack (you too, Taz) to tear into enemies and dig through soft ground, these high mobility weapons will have you on your toes and keep your hands warm.\nWhat would our youthful hero be without a ranged weapon? That's right, a hero without a ranged weapon. So here's a bow, not any old bow, but a Super Awesome Crimson Bow\u2122 (nice). Acquired early on in the game, this will help you hurt/take out weaker foes from a distance. Use the bow to trigger traps and puzzles, and even augment with elemental arrows such as ice, electricity, and explosive (explosions are an element, right?). Once you've unlocked them, it's your choice which to roll out with, depending on your play style, whoa!\nSet in the world of Rosantica after the Great Conflict, a war that carried on for decades between parallel worlds, one of humanity, one of gods. The worlds once kept in peace by the Crimson Goddess Sorrell and Lord Zealock, now torn between each other.\nThe Great Conflict between overlapping worlds, caused by Sorrell\u2019s forbidden love of a mortal knight, Allistair. Falling for humanity's innocence and good nature, Sorrell leaves her world for another, sending Zealock into madness with her involvement with the \"frail humanity\".\nDecades of war have gone by between worlds, as things begin to look grim for the people of Rosantica. Realizing she can do no more to protect them from Zealock's growing rage, Sorrell initiates an ultimate sacrifice with her and her love, giving their lives to banish what has now become The Scourge. Locking Lord Zealock and his followers away to the malicious world they have created.\nBut don\u2019t live in the past, the world around you is brimming with exploration and discovery. Track down a mysterious stranger that appears to be following you as the barrier between worlds begins to crack, and investigate her ties to The Scourge and Zealock.\n  Roam the fantastic world both on foot and with your loyal companion Dex, a last gift from Sorrell and a guardian of Rosantica, helping both man and beast alike take back their homes. Will you follow Flynn on his journey through this war torn land?\n  Venture into the heart of evil itself, and tackle the horrors of The Scourge head-on. A once pristine land of gods, now an infested land filled with hatred. Track clues about your past and the Crimson power that grows within you leading to this nest of evil, and uncover what really lies at the heart.\nFlynn must hurry, with every passing day The Scourge\u2019s hold on Rosantica grows, slowly plunging the world into madness and decay with its noxious corruption. You must seek to end Zealock\u2019s reign of disease and lunacy before it\u2019s too late. \nTraveling between dimensions, Flynn controls the ability to tear open portals to The Scourge with the power of Crimson. Finding alternate paths and searching for trapped Rosanticans taken away from their homes. But be wary, The Scourge has many eyes in search of Flynn.\n    Journey through the vast island of Rosantica in search for answers to stop the land from falling victim to the corruption. The world is pieced together to transition seamlessly as you travel across the 5 unique regions.\nExplore the frigid Mistral Peak \u2013 a frozen over mountain once brimming with enterprise and discovery of its rich natural resources and fossils, now fallen victim to The Scourge\u2019s wretched influence in the form of a supernaturally dangerous blizzard. Discover what infernal power has summoned up this ferocious storm and help put a stop to it.\nWade through the once secluded and dazzling waters of The Hollow's Isles. A group of seaside caverns and alcoves that were once the pinnacle of natural beauty and serenity that have been ravaged by the relentless winds brought on by the blizzards of Mistral Peak above. Track your quest into the damp caves to battle off the mutated crustaceans that have forced out the indigenous Neptyn to flee their ancestral homes.\nLose yourself in the sprawling gardens of Rustwood. Home to the legendary proving grounds of the warrior tribe, the Mazir, and their Fighting Coliseum. The Mazir are a beetle-like people that are honor bound to prove themselves capable warriors by duking it out in this immense arena. Be warned, however, for The Scourge has seeped even into this land of once sacred trials. The swamps of Rustwood grow darker as each day goes by, causing hazardous poison storms to awaken.\nYour quest for knowledge will eventually lead you to the home of all scholarly pursuits, the famed Shivering Spire. What used to be the beacon of knowledge and symbol of Rosantica\u2019s prosperity, is now home to a portal of the netherworld, with its devout healers and once benevolent sorcerers now becoming vessels for The Scourge\u2019s evil magic to pour into the world of Rosantica. Flynn will be bombarded with acolytes that are now driven mad by their enhanced dark powers, as well as assaulted by powerful warlocks that once dared to challenge gods themselves.\nIn between journeys, Flynn will return to Sanctia. A stronghold where his most valued allies reside, banding together to help Flynn fight off the corruption. Here Flynn will barter rare Crimson Shards found throughout the world for new techniques and upgrades, as well as complete quests for the villagers.\nFlynn: Son of Crimson features crisp, hand-crafted pixel art that's designed to compliment its frenetic gameplay. Readability and strong visual tells are key components in our artistic process, as we realize how important it is for a game to be crystal-clear in its visual feedback to the player.  \nEach chunky pixel is deliberately and thoughtfully placed to create a memorable world for players to explore. Mischievous goblins, big-bellied fish men, blood-thirsty wolves, and more are brought to life with expressive animations brimming with personality.\nFrom concept art, to character sprites, and final polished animations - we aim to deliver a product we're truly proud of, and one that communicates to our players how much we truly care for the timeless and endearing craft of pixel-art!\n    From our composer, Jacob Lincke: Starting with a clean slate is always exciting and inspiring. \u201cFlynn: Son of Crimson\u201d needs satisfying music to accompany its already magical looking art style. I started looking at things I thought the game reminded me of; other games, movies and even places in the real world. I want the soundtrack to have its own unique voice, instantly connecting it to the game.\nI have a deep love for traditional folk music from all over the world which made me think of all sorts of fun instruments and what they could bring to the table. Flutes and keyed fiddles are combined with medieval lutes and finally mixed together with a grand orchestra making you feel less alone. All of this and a touch of retro synths to go along with the cute art style results in a collaboration between Scandinavian folk music and the Far East.\nI imagined Flynn wandering enchanting forests such as those found in Ghibli movies and traversing cold mountains of my homeland Sweden. I want the music to help Flynn telling his story, setting the atmosphere and be beautiful at the same time.\n    Always felt like you needed something Crimsony for your wall? Me too. Put this pretty 18\" by 24\" poster all over it and have your friends say, \"whoa\"! A beautiful illustration by Jaya Ply (@Nikingply).\nGet warm with this high quality t-shirt designed by miski! Printed on a 50/50 blend shirt for maximum comfort. We may or may not kiss each one before they ship. T-shirt sizing and possible color options will be provided after the campaign.\nDig your eyes intothe Official Flynn: Son of Crimson art book containing used and unused concept art, pixel art, level design sketches, fan art, a deeper look into the lore, and more! Size of the book to be decided later in development, based on our content. \nBecome one with the game with your spooky skeleton in the ground, and your likeness drawn in to your own gravestone to be placed in the Rustwood Graveyard. In other words, your face on a rock. \nDesign an NPC to fit in to the game! We'll contact you to work on your NPC's design, personality, dialogue (nothing naughty!), back story, and favorite things.\nGet your own custom room! You choose its location, style, what it's full of, maybe a bit of lore, maybe a bit of graffiti, maybe your face everywhere, I don't know. Put your own flair in to it!\nCombine every design tier before to create a sidequest! Include your secret room and your NPC in this quest to make Flynn fetch a bucket of water, or to do 50 pushups, whatever your heart desires!\nA story being told right from our hearts and fingers, Flynn is a young baby boy that has been on our minds over the last two years. As we write this, we are roughly one full year into development on Flynn: Son of Crimson from when we began putting this design all on paper.\nactual paper!\nSo far being funded completely by our own money, we feel we're now in a good place to introduce Flynn to Kickstarter. In order to continue to fulfill our dreams in making Flynn a real boy, we need your support! We're very confident in the head start we have on the basics in design and development, with a lot of the core features already built and working. A large portion will be going to the art, allowing us to give our artists more consistent hours and maybe even hire extra help. Additionally, the sound is very important to us, so that will be a big investment as well.\nIs this your first game? \nFirst bigger scale game, yes. We have 2 other games we released in the wild on mobile though, which can be found here:  \nSamurai Blitz\nRaccoon Rascals\nWe also have a couple projects we have worked on in the past that didn\u2019t quite make the cut (we all have them), but we see them as more of a learning process and who knows, we may come back to them in 50 years time.\nSpecial Thanks\nAndrew Filip - Web design/development, help with the trailer.\nJohan Aronson - Being part of Flynn's original birth long ago, and the title screen.\nmiski - Being the greatest for designing the t-shirt last minute with us.\n           This project is promoted by Jellop, a direct\u00ad response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always risks and challenges for a project like this.

This campaign is specifically for the funding the creation Issues 8 and 9, which will complete Volume1. That means MOST of the book is already complete. I only have about 50 pages to go out of the 225+ pages in the series.\nNew to the story? Not to worry!  All of Volume 1 is available in this campaign. Also Issues 8 and 9 will be of course available as well for those who have already been following along.\nThanks to the lovely and amazing Kickstarter community I've had Issues 2 - 7 funded on previous campaigns. This project began years ago and has slowly turned into something I am really devoted to and would love to work on for years to come.\nGIRRION is a sweeping sci-fi fantasy story of a hero's journey in a distant world in a distant time. The saga is told through the eyes of Jarra, a poor factory worker who dreams of escaping his world of endless toil. His wish comes true, though not in a way he would have ever wanted, when his city is attacked by a dark entity called the Halodron. He escapes the conflict, but only to be thrust into a war of other-worldy magic and weaponry.\nAmidst the destruction, history begins to unravel as soldiers of a forgotten war resurface and the secrets of a mysterious technology known as Girrion come to light as its scattered remains suddenly start to \u201creawaken\u201d. With little time and resources, the hero must help save his crumbling empire from its destructive past.\n        Inking in progress\n        Volume 1 cover art in progress\n     Girrion started off as a hobby over 15 years ago. Initially it was more of an illustration portfolio than a story. I wanted to be a concept artist, so I would spend a lot of time designing characters, ships and environments.\nI didn't consider myself a writer back then, but I started getting ideas for a story. When I would draw environments or characters the ideas would just pop in my head. One scene led to another, then another etc. It took a lot of time, but the experience put in over the years not only helped the art, it also gave me time to develop the story more and give it more depth than it had in the earlier drafts.\nAge Range: (PG - PG-13 )\n- No sex or bad language\n- No excessive gore. Girrion is primarily about a war so there is cartoon violence similar to the level of Star Wars, but more of it.\n            This will be the first campaign where a full volume book is available. It will be 225+ pages in length. 6.14\" x 9.2\"\nVolume 1 mockup. Cover art and design are in progress.\n Previous campaigns single issues were available in hardcover or softcover, and these formats will be available in this campaign as well. \nSample Hardcover (Issue #7)\n Hardcover comic issues are 6\" x 9\". Grey cloth with a dust jacket. Each issue is anywhere from 22 - 26 pages in length.\nSoftcover samples (Issues 1-9)\nSoftcover comic issues are 6\"x9\" and have a glossy cover with a stock thicker than standard comics. The interior art is full color and has a watercolor feel.\nSample Character Sketch\n  Sample 4\" x 6\" print\n  How Do Add Ons Work?\nHere's what you do:\nClick \"Manage Your Pledge\" in the upper right corner (blue button) Add the total of your Add On to your pledge amount. (i.e. one Giclee Fine art print is $25.) You don't need to change the tier you've selected You are done! Later you'll get a backer survey asking how you spent your add-on dollars and for other pertinent info. Thank you!\n  Generally, about half of my expenses come from printing the books and mailing them. The other half of the budget is going into the production. Most of what this campaign money goes towards is large chunks of time for me to focus fully on the book. One issue takes me 300 - 400 hours. If I'm able to knock off some days working freelance on other jobs, the books come out much faster.\n  Scout Comics is now publishing Girrion! They released Issue 1 last October and will be releasing books up through this Fall. They are an indie publisher\u2013 very supportive of their creators and just a great group of people all around. They also have a wide range of comics which you can check out on their site. www.scoutcomics.com\nFollow\nWebsite: www.girrion.com\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/Girrion1\nInstagram: www.instagram.com/girrion1/\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/girrion1/\nMusic from Kickstarter Video: \"Night Owl\" by Broke For Free", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBeing that this is not the first comic I've made there aren't too many major challenges with getting the book made, but there are some small ones:\n\nSome of the artwork on certain pages goes fast, some takes very long. There are some complex scenes in this issue with lots of characters and elements that need strong design. Again from past experience, the artwork can sometimes take a bit longer than expected. Also, keep in mind I have to mix this work in with the day job.\n\nI've learned a lot from previous Kickstarter campaigns, and I am getting more and more efficient. I'm also trying to find ways to make rewards as cost-effective as possible too. One way of doing this is to do more than one issue per campaign, which cuts down on mailing costs.

As Spymasters, position your Spies and Specialists to outmaneuver your opponent and dominate the battlefield.\nPlayers must stay one step ahead of their opponent on a battleground that is as much in the minds of the Spymasters as on the board. Predict your opponent\u2019s moves to prevent them from gaining ground, and when all hope seems lost, snatch victory away from your opponent with clever use of your Specialist agents.\nIf you are the first to capture both parts of the Doomsday Device, it\u2019s game over for your opponent.\nA quick review of the game board and object will reveal that Pocket Ops is based on the familiar framework of tic-tac-toe \u2014 but don't write it off as child's play just yet! The prediction mechanic and Specialist abilities have been proven to offer playtesters both challenge and laughter. Don't believe it? Check out the sample Print n' Play files below:\n   ...or check out the Tabletop Simulator mod on Steam!\n  Pocket Ops is the first published design of Brandon Beran, with art and graphic design by industry veteran Josh Cappel.\n         Pocket Ops is quick to pick up, because you already know how to play; If you've played Tic-Tac-Toe before, you have the fundamentals: place markers in a grid, trying to get three in a row. But wait! The simple but game-changing twist with Pocket Ops is that before you make a move, the other player gets to secretly predict where you are going to go. After your move, if they were right, your move is canceled. In addition, a variety of Specialist tokens that introduce all sorts of sneaky abilities will change the way you place and predict. Pocket Ops takes a classic framework and breathes surprising life into it.

For Canadians, this also covers import taxes and customs duties.\nUnfortunately, we can't offer the same outside the US and Canada, because it is simply too expensive. However, any EU orders will be \"EU Friendly\", in that they will not incur VAT or customs fees on delivery.\n  We know that international shipping is annoyingly expensive; believe us, we are just as annoyed as you are! However, to help offset the shipping costs a bit, we have created the 4- and 10-copy levels with lower pricing per copy.\n     We are very happy to bring this project to you via Kickstarter. Keeping true to our philosophy, we have asked for an amount that will get us halfway to what we need to produce the game. It will take about twice as much money as we are asking to bring Pocket Ops to life, and our part is ready.

Delays can occur. Sometimes you have to go back and forth on color samples six times just to get the color right, and even then the color isn't perfect. But what we do promise is that we will hold ourselves to the same high standards and transparency we expect from other board game publishers and our previous projects, and we will be completely honest and open with each of you every step of the way.\n\nAside from artwork changes that may come about as a result of stretch goals, this game is finished and ready to go to Bang Wee, the experienced manufacturer of our two previous titles.\n\nWe learned a lot from our first Kickstarter campaign, and we feel confident that those lessons will help us make this campaign successful.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Spy in training", "descp": "Support our project + 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}], "stat": ["35 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 14 or more", "title": "Spy", "descp": "All Backers at this level will receive:\n\u2022 1 copy of Pocket Ops with all stretch goals\n\u2022 1 KS Exclusive Doomsday Device lapel pin\n\u2022 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017\nAll physical items in this reward level will ship together with Pocket Ops.\nFREE shipping within the US, $5 Canada, $10 everywhere else", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["933 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 28 or more", "title": "Stroop Spy", "descp": "All Backers at this level will receive:\n\u2022 1 copy of Pocket Ops with all stretch goals\n\u2022 1 copy of Stroop\n\u2022 1 KS Exclusive Doomsday Device lapel pin\n\u2022 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017\nAll physical items in this reward level will ship together with Pocket Ops.\n$5 for shipping within the US, $9 Canada\nLimited to 250 Backers", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["55 backers", "Limited (195 left of 250)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 36 or more", "title": "Unreal Estate Spy", "descp": "All Backers at this level will receive:\n\u2022 1 copy of Pocket Ops with all stretch goals\n\u2022 1 copy of Unreal Estate\n\u2022 1 copy of the Gothic Estates expansion\n\u2022 1 KS Exclusive Doomsday Device lapel pin\n\u2022 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017\nAll physical items in this reward level will ship together with Pocket Ops.\n$5 for shipping within the US, $9 Canada\nLimited to 250 Backers", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["45 backers", "Limited (205 left of 250)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 48 or more", "title": "Spy Hard", "descp": "All Backers at this level will receive:\n\u2022 4 copies of Pocket Ops with all stretch goals\n\u2022 4 KS Exclusive Doomsday Device lapel pins\n\u2022 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017\nAll physical items in this reward level will ship together with Pocket Ops.\n$7 for shipping within the US, $12 Canada, $15 everywhere else", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["19 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 52 or more", "title": "Guild Spy", "descp": "All Backers at this level will receive:\n\u2022 1 copy of Pocket Ops with all stretch goals\n\u2022 1 copy of Stroop\n\u2022 1 copy of Unreal Estate\n\u2022 1 copy of the Gothic Estates expansion\n\u2022 1 KS Exclusive Doomsday Device lapel pin\n\u2022 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017\nAll physical items in this reward level will ship together with Pocket Ops.\n$10 for shipping within the US, $15 Canada\nLimited to 250 Backers", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["43 backers", "Limited (207 left of 250)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Santa Spy", "descp": "All Backers at this level will receive:\n\u2022 10 copies of Pocket Ops with all stretch goals\n\u2022 10 KS Exclusive Doomsday Device lapel pins\n\u2022 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017\nAll physical items in this reward level will ship together with Pocket Ops.\n$10 for shipping within the US, $20 Canada, $30 everywhere else", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["6 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 1,000 or more", "title": "\"Bond...

Kickstarter has enabled a renascence in miniatures by allowing manufacturers to appeal directly to their fan base. With the success of our last Kickstarter at more than double the funding level, we were able to have several more figures sculpted, printed and put into production than we initially planned. The funding level directly affects the expansion of the range with our backers literally funding our efforts with their venture capital. What better way to participate in creating the miniatures you want while supporting the hobby we love?\nKicktraq\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere is practically no chance of this project not being fulfilled once the successful funding level is reached. Fortress Figures is one of the oldest professional miniatures production companies with more than three decades of experience casting the finest white metal miniatures and capabilities for casting several thousand figures per day.

Only the sculpting and printing is outsourced and the sculpting portion of the project is already completed. We have again, allowed ourselves what we consider to be an extraordinarily abundant amount of time to complete this project. We have, so far, completed 3 Kickstarter projects.

All you need is to learn this simple method of Cognitive Drawing and you will soon be decoding and memorizing how to draw things like you never imagined possible. \nHow can I make such a bold claim? Because this technique is exactly how I taught myself how to draw.\nI believe that with Cognitive Drawing you will quickly learn how to test yourself and force your brain to start memorizing what you are learning. \nWhat is Cognitive Drawing?\nCognitive Drawing will be an easy (90+ page) workbook designed to teach you how to learn to draw anatomy from memory. Not only will you learn to draw but you will learn to do it in a way that helps your brain retain what you learned. \nThis book is perfect for beginners and intermediate artists of all ages.\nThe technique in this book is exactly how I (Jason Brubaker) taught myself to draw as a teenager without an expensive art education. At the age of twenty I was hired by a storyboarding agency in Los Angeles and I have been a professional artist ever since working in storyboards, animation and visual development on some of the biggest movies and commercials in Hollywood. (You can see my IMDB credits here.)\nWe are printing the book on sketch book paper perfect for drawing with pencil.\nHow did Cognitive Drawing start?\nBack in the mid 90's when I was trying to learn to draw, I developed this method while trying to memorize anatomy and different artistic styles. Although I didn't have a name for it yet, it was the way that I was able to learn anatomy quickly. It was't long before I was able to draw anatomy and styles quickly from memory and I attribute much of this success to this method.\nOver the years I have tried to explain the Cognitive Drawing method to friends assuming that others were doing it as well. To my surprise, I have never found anyone teaching or using this technique. Twenty years later I decided to make an experimental worksheet to show a drawing class how to quickly learn to draw things on their own. To my surprise, about 90% of the students found my method surprisingly easy and highly effective for learning to draw from memory. \nSince it worked so well for others I decided that it was time to try to make a Cognitive Drawing book using this technique to aid in learning one of the hardest things to learn to draw: anatomy. I announced the idea on my Youtube channel and nearly 100 people signed up to be beta testers for an experimental 40 page anatomy book using Cognitive Drawing. \nAfter a few months of testing Cognitive Drawing the beta testers were finished and sent me their results and I was once again blown away with the high percentage of positive feedback and massive improvement for almost all of the beta testers.\nThe beta-test worked better than I expected again but it still needed much improvement to be a real workbook. I received much needed feedback from the testers and studied all the problem areas in their drawings I was able to refine Cognitive Drawing into an amazing and fun daily exercise designed to walk a beginner artist through the entire male figure (from any angle or pose) within a month.\nWhat is in the Cognitive Drawing Book?\nCognitive Drawing will be a 96+ page workbook book designed to fold flat so you can draw on all the pages. \n(The page count will keep growing as we hit stretch goals. I would like to get it up to 140 pages if possible.)\nAbout 60% of the workbook will be cognitive drawing worksheets and the rest of the book is full of lessons and exercises to help you tie it all together. This book will help you memorize proportions of body and face, muscle groups, poses and more and will show you how to use Cognitive Drawing to learn how to memorize any drawing style you find. \nAlong with Cognitive Exercises the book is filled with muscle breakdowns and other exercises that helped me understand how to build a figure from scratch. Here are some samples of some of the daily exercises:\nThe book will be a combination of Cognitive Drawing exercises mixed with anatomy breakdowns and other drawing lessons.\nOnce you complete the book, not only will you know anatomy but you will also be able to use this technique with all kinds of other reference material like: anatomy books, comic books, robots, dinosaurs, aliens, monsters, machines, manga, your favorite artists or even photos. The sky is the limit!\nWho Is Cognitive Drawing For?\nThe book is designed for Homeschoolers, Drawing Groups, Classrooms and personal use. There is no nudity in the book so it's safe for all ages.\nI have seen much improvement in students ages of 8 and up. As long as there is a desire to learn to draw and you can spend about 30 minutes a day focused on doing an exercise then this is for you.\nBacked by Science?\nInterestingly enough, some of my findings agree with what scientists have learned about how the brain learns and retains information. This is the field of Cognitive Psychology. I have even interviewed a Cognitive Scientist who experimented with my method and he has helped me develop it to be even better than I expected.\nI will post an interview with him here where he breaks down the scientific principles used in Cognitive Drawing and why they work.\nProduction Timeframe\nThere are about 3 months of production left on the book depending on how many extra pages we can get funding to add. I would like to be able to make the book 140 pages but this would mean hitting stretch goals. So depending on how many pages the final book is will determine how quickly it goes to print.\nOnce printing begins it will take about 3 months to have the books in my studio and they will be shipped out shortly after that.\nI am setting the delivery deadline to April 2018 as a worst case scenario. But the funding amount will determine the exact timeframe and we might be able to have the books in your hands by this Christmas. \nMoney\nI am planning to print 3000 copies of this book quoted at $10,410. With shipping estimates as well as Kickstarter fees and Card processing fees, it will be over $16,000. We need another 9k for the remaining production costs and assistance to complete all the pages and worksheets. This brings our total to $24,900 to make sure this book can get off the ground.\nIf we don't reach this goal then I will not be able to invest the time or money to get the book printed so please help by sharing this with everyone you know who wants to learn how to draw.\nWho Am I?\nI'm Jason Brubaker. I am a self taught artist. I started my professional career at the age of 19 and have worked for more than 20 years in the entertainment industry on big movies (Blade, Pitch Black, Kung Fu Panda 1, 2 & 3) and hundreds of commercials before launching my own company to publish graphic novels and books. Now I self-publish graphic novels for a living.

All backers at pledge levels of $50.00 or more at the end of the campaign will receive all stretch goal rewards included with their pledge rewards on fulfillment. The stretch goal rewards will be awarded in addition to your pledge level and will be automatically included with your shipment when your pledge is fulfilled.

Kickstarter has enabled a renascence in miniatures by allowing manufacturers to appeal directly to their fan base. With the success of our last Kickstarter at more than double the funding level, we were able to have several more figures sculpted, printed and put into production than we initially planned. The funding level directly affects the expansion of the range with our backers literally funding our efforts with their venture capital.

We have again, allowed ourselves what we consider to be an extraordinarily abundant amount of time to complete this project. A quick look at our previous Kickstarters will show that we shipped rewards to backers ahead of schedule. We received a total of 2 (two) complaints from all of our backers regarding fulfillment. One of these was simply the delivery company not getting it to the backer which was eventually resolved by sending a replacement and the other one was a backer not happy with a defective casting that was resolved by substitution and replacement. We believe we have a 100% backer satisfaction record after two successful kickstarters. We're not perfect but if a problem does arise we do our honest best to resolve any issues. \n\nAn unforeseen event, though unlikely, could be, well, unforeseen.

Face new horrors with sword and shild or embrace a dark alliance as they delve into the unknown depths of Relicblade.\nThe Bone and Darkness Kickstarter campaign offers the opportunity to add rad new characters to Relicblade. These expansions not only present the chance to expand the game, but also offer a great entry point for new players. The Bone and Darkness Kickstarter campaign promises to deliver all-new factions, characters, unit types, upgrades, and dark new powers that add wonderfully to an already delightful fantasy-battle experience.\nGet both of the new expansions and eight incredible miniatures with the recommended Bold Adventurer pledge level!\nEuropean backers will have their rewards shipped from Germany.\nBone and Darkness\nMysterious skull faced villains stalk the wild-lands. Early reports indicated these sinister watchers had something to do with the Pig-Men. Now we find that these dark wanderers are an evil threat unlike anything we've seen before. \nThe Dark Wanderer model kit includes the option to assemble the character with a Longbow or a Maul. Choose your favorite or buy an extra kit in the add-ons so you can have both builds.\nThe Dark Wanderers are unyielding warriors whose martial prowess is undeniable. They often carry powerful mauls or strange bone-bows. One must never underestimate these foes. Some have slaughtered legendary knights in single combat. Others expertly kill from a distance with jagged bone arrows then silently disappear into unnatural darkness.\nThese wanderers wield dark bone-magic, a new form of necromancy that spurs unnatural growth and creates mutated skeletal monstrosities. Unlike the dead who haunt the ruins, bound to this world by ancient magic, these creatures behave as beasts. They are furious, manic, beings who attack without provocation and with unnatural savagery.\nthe arms swap on these guys.\nThe bone construct is the most disturbing of all. It is a towering creature assembled from the magic-warped bones of multiple bodies. Without any life of it's own, these infernal engines of destruction are powered by life-force torn from its allies. These unstoppable monsters are immensely strong, and are able to unleash a fearsome howl that can shatter the will of the most stalwart hero.\n3D renders of the Bone and Darkness Faction Pack\nThe Lone Guard\nMuch of what we know about the horror of the coming Darkness is through the valiant efforts of the Lone Guard. The Lone Guard is an ancient order of warriors and rangers who patrol the wilderness. They are an ever vigilant force against every kind of impending threat.\nThe Lone Guard Rangers are hardy frontiersmen who travel hidden paths and have an uncanny kinship with nature. Armed with a keen longbow, the rangers are deadly hunters who stalk both powerful game and fiendish enemies.\nSome rangers have forged powerful bonds with the Smilodon Fatalis. These saber-toothed cats are natural predators who take to the partnership in deadly accord. The Saber-toothed cat uses its powerful claws to wrestle its prey into position before using its dagger-like fangs. Working in tandem with a ranger the cat will hold the prey in an exposed position creating an opening for its partner to land a singularly deadly strike.\nA Saber-tooth Cat?! UGH! SO COOL!\nThe Lone Guard Warriors are lightly armored fighters who are quick to respond to any threat. These intrepid fighters dive into combat with razor sharp skill and deadly poise. Their preferred armament is the bastard sword and round shield. They use both as weapons for quick attack and defense, and are a versatile presence on the battlefield.\nOh rad.\nThe Billman brings a useful set of skills to any warband. His polearm grants a reach advantage, while the hooked end can be used to force the enemy off balance. These trained soldiers work in close partnership with whoever hires them, and are ready to hook a shield or deliver a finishing blow as needed.\nHandsome mustache included at no extra charge.\n3D renders of The Lone Guard Faction Pack.\nThe wave two expansions introduce two new character types to Relicblade. The Bone and Darkness expansion introduces the construct character type. Constructs have no life of their own and enter play inert. Through the application of specific magic, players will be able to bring these creatures to bare against their foes. Constructs are a powerful addition to your war band for relatively few points. The real cost to your war party will be what it takes to keep the terrible bone construct empowered. Constructs can only be removed from play by magical attacks while inert, and will likely remain a relevant game-changing piece through the entire battle.\nThe Lone Guard expansion brings the much anticipated companion character type to the game. Companions operate in tandem with the character that hires them. A skilled billman can be attached to your hero for a few extra points. These two characters can activate together to use their skills and abilities to achieve incredible things.\nRanger and companion Smilodon support one another in this dangerous encounter.\nEach of the new Relicblade faction packs will include a special scenario related to the faction. These thematic adventures add fun context to your battles. The scenarios will also seamlessly integrate into the forthcoming campaign rules for Relicblade! \nLearn more about Relicblade on the page for the Original Kickstarter Campaign or at www.relicblade.com\nChoose the pledge level that's right for you. Remember, by backing Relicblade you're helping it exist! Get ahold of this delightfully unique miniatures game. Relicblade is 100% natural, pure, and unfiltered imagination that is bottled at the source. It is untouched by the sanitizing influence of a board-room or stock-holders. Enjoy the benefits of live and active gaming cultures.\nEuropean backers will have their rewards shipped from Germany.\nYour wife won't be mad. It costs less than a (fancy) sandwich...\nTake the oath of the Lone Guard and resist the Darkness!\nNo good-guys for me, thanks. There is only darkness in this mortal shell.\n If you're new to Relicblade the \"Champion of Adventure\" is AWESOME! At this mega-rad pledge level you'll get the core game along with the \"Bone and Darkness\" and \"The Lone Guard\" expansions. This pledge level includes twenty one metal miniatures, the rulebook, tokens, dice, and not to mention 70+ unique cards including all kinds of amazing characters, magic swords, advanced battle tactics, and even snacks incase your pigs get a bit hungry.\nStretch Goals are a lot of the fun of Kickstarter.  I have a few particularly awesome things that I really want to make. Without a little extra success here I won't be able to take on the projects right away. If we are able to unlock these stretch goals they'll be made available as add-ons. So here's hoping y'all love Relicblade half as much as I do, and we can get this mind blisteringly awesome stuff together!\nThe Deep: Guest Artist Series\nAs the creator of Relicblade I have enjoyed unprecedented creative freedom, and thanks to your help I've been able to get my unfiltered imagination onto tabletops the world over! It's such an incredible experience that I want to share it with artists who have styles that shouldn't be filtered before smashing up dungeons around the world. In accordance with what is right and just, I'm launching the Relicblade Guest Artist Series.\nI first saw Keegan Kaya McGee's work on ye olde world wide web. His art delights me to no end. His style is a similar mixture of badass and goofy like my own. However, his work is completely different in so many fantastic ways! This wonderful blend of similar yet completely wacky and unique made him the perfect choice for my first guest artist. Keegan did the illustrations for the cards, we collaborated on the rules, and I'll do the sculpture! It's all very exciting...\nI can't imagine not falling in love with this stuff. but that's up to you. Definitely check out keegankayamcgee.com and use your eye-balls to soak up some @KeeganKayaMcGee and the tag #thingsyoumightfindinadungeon on Instagram.\nThe multi part miniature can be assembled as the Shark Warrior or the Eel Sorcerer!!\nI want the Campaign Rules so bad I can taste it. It's a pretty big undertaking so I needed to place the goal up here at 15k. I know I'll need to take a pretty decent chunk of time out of regular work to make this happen, but I sure as heck want to. I love a good pick-up death-match style game, but especially in a fantasy setting like this I want to see my characters advance and take on dangerous new adventures. \nWhat are Add-Ons?\nAdd-ons give Backers the option to add extra bits to their rewards for a little extra money. This is the best opportunity for people to grab extra components to optimize their Relicblade experience.\nThe Faction sets are right around 65-70 points worth of characters in-game. Since a standard game is 100 points a few Pigs, some extra Bone Stalkers, a Knight, some Thieves, or a noble Cleric of Justice, will bump your war-band to full fighting strength right off the bat.\nUsing the marketplace below you can look at what is available and adjust your pledge accordingly. I want to make sure you get everything you want out of this Kickstarter campaign, and I believe this will help. \nShipping\nShipping will be processed through Kickstarter, the old fashioned way. When you select your pledge level you will also be asked to add USA, Canada, or \"rest of world\" shipping. I do my best to ship in the most affordable way I can manage, but it's still pretty costly to ship internationally. I'm sorry for that.\nThe note about \"add-on\" shipping only really applies if you ordered at the digital scholar, or scholar levels. Scholar level will ask for a little shipping, but if you add a box set we'll need to make sure we have enough postage.\nRelicblade miniatures are carefully crafted white-metal model kits. Each figure is supplied unassembled and unpainted. Painting miniatures is a delightful part of the hobby that can, and should, be enjoyed by people of all ages!\nI put together this little video to help shine light on how it's done. It can be hard to know where to start. Here I'll show you how easy it is to make something look decent with very little effort! The first video covers assembly while part-two goes into painting.\nI love this hobby, and It's my pleasure to help you get into it any way I can. In these videos I pretty much say everything I would say if we were hanging out. Give it a watch and play along at home if you like.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIn February of this year I ran a successful Kickstarter campaign to create Relicblade. It was a truly amazing experience. Thanks to the support of backers from around the world I was able to create an extremely rad finished product.

FANS AND NEW FACES!!\n  It is with great pleasure that I return to Kickstarter once again to fund a new set of Fantasy Norse 28 mm heroic miniatures!\n  In this campaign I intend to produce a  host of 20 new Njorn characters of various roles sure to tread ruin upon their foes in the Frosty Ruins and forlorn wildernesses of the Great Cold North. Berserker, Hird, and Huscarls, Rangers, and  Mages. And the Norns allowing, mayhaps even more. There are many allies at the call of the Northfolk if the need be.\n   Backers can pledge for an entire warband ( 10 figures in total as of the launch of the campaign ) cast in high quality white metal, or pick and choose individual figures from the selection funded by this campaign. OR backers can pledge for the same warband cast in high fidelity resin or resin solos of individuals funded by the campaign or a mix of both!   The pledges are as follows:\n   SOLO METAL ..................This pledge level rewards backers with 1 copy of any one of the figures successfully funded through this campaign cast in high quality white metal.  \n  SOLO RESIN ..................This pledge level rewards backers with 1 copy of any one of the figures successfully funded through this campaign cast in high fidelity resin.  \n   WAR BAND METAL ..............This pledge rewards backers with one full set of any 10 figures successfully funded over the course of this campaign cast in high quality white metal.  \n   WAR BAND RESIN ..............This pledge rewards backers with one full set of any 10 figures successfully funded over the course of this campaign cast in high fidelity Resin.\n   WAR PARTY METAL.......This pledge rewards backers with any  20 figures successfully funded over the course of this campaign cast in high quality white metal.\n    WAR PARTY  RESIN.......This pledge rewards backers with any  20 figures successfully funded over the course of this campaign cast in high fidelity Resin.\n Here be the place where stand the long list of the hardy souls afoot in the snows of the cold north and the price they demand for their hands in battle. many of the items pictured here are still slightly WIP but these will all be finished before the end of the campaign.\nAll items listed in this Section are offered as selections for the \" Warband \" and \" War Party \" pledge rewards. each of which offering a VERY hefty discount off of the RRP of Red Box Games figures ( $9-$10 ) per figure. Please keep in mind that these prices expire at the close of this kickstarter and that post campaign pledge-ups or jump-ins will not be allowed. if you want in on this deal you have to be a part of the kickstarter.\n    All of the characters listed here cost as follows;\n   #1 $7.00 metal, $15 resin\n  #2 $7.00 metal , $15 resin\n    #3 $7.00 metal , $15 resin\n  #4 $7.00 metal, $15 resin\n  #5 $7.00 metal, $15 resin\n  #6 $7.00 metal, $15 resin\n  #7 $7.00 metal, $15 resin\n    #8 $7.00 metal, $15 resin\n  #9 $7.00 metal, $15 resin\n  #10 $7.00 metal, $15 resin\n    #11 $7.00 metal, $15 resin\n  #12 $7.00 metal, $15 resin\n  #13 $7.00 metal, $15 resin\n  #14 $7.00 metal, $15 resin\n  #15 $7.00 metal, $15 resin\n    #16 $7.00 metal, $15 resin\n    #17 $7.00 metal, $15 resin\n  #18 $7.00 metal, $15 resin\n  #19 $7.00 metal, $15 resin\n  #20 $7.00 metal, $15 resin\n                  .\n After the close of the kickstarter, full collection and transfer of the funds gained by the campaign, and the full production process of the items funded by the campaign, Upon readiness of the rewards for fulfillment you will be issued a link to an external website which will allow you to select the specific items and quantity there of you would like to apply your pledge to as a reward. At this point you will also be billed for your postage as needed. This way all of the information is nice and neat and easily manageable and you do not have to fuss with multiple payments strung out over the course of delivery.\n    Here be the place where await the stranger folk a wander in the Cold North. Mayhaps they are friend. Mayhaps they are foe.\n        I work with a great team of very talented and reliable contractors who handle all of the mold making and metal and resin casting of my products and I operate a live webstore where in you can view and purchase any one of my currently available products.\n  http://red-box-games.com/\n\n     IMPORTANT!!! DO NOT add funds to cover postage to your pledge. Postage will be billed upon readiness to deliver. Any funds collected via kickstarter MUST be applied to the rewards ONLY.\n  This project is produced in the US so the postage within the US should not exceed $5 for most rewards packages. The reason I say most is just to caveat for the odd wonderfully insane backer who pledges for 20 sets of 20 figures. Obviously heavier packages that exceed the standard priority rate postage boxes would cost more to ship.\nAll packages shipped within the US will be shipped with all the necessary cushion and damage prevention measures we can provide to make sure that your goodies arrive safe and sound and in pristine condition. US backers will of course not need to worry about any import duties, customs fees, shipping company collapses, or bands of savage pirates preventing them from receiving their beloved Red Box Games minis.\n  I also have confirmation that we Will be fulfilling with help from oir very goodmfriends at Hasslefree miniatures in the UK Many thanks Dameon!!\n  AUSTRALIA: I do really love all you guys very much, and I am sorry yall always seem to get stuck at the end of fulfillment. To that end I am going to assure you that your rewards will be the first shipped when fulfillment begins. You have all been so patient and loyal and I do not want you guys to feel taken for granted at all. I cannot however absorb the customs fees and import duties or the postage costs fro shipping to Australia.\n  CANADA: again as above. I am eternally grateful for yall's continued support and patience and I assure you all that your rewards will be shipped along side of the Australian backer's rewards. The postage costs to Canada can fluctuate rather dramatically and there could be customs fees incurred.\n  I try to keep my postage costs as close to actual cost of the postage and materials as possible, subsidizing the costs of our time to sort and package as part of the cost of making this as affordable as possible for you all.\n\n     For those who are unfamiliar with me as a sculptor and with my business red box games I am a sculptor of finely detailed 28mm scale fantasy miniatures. Most often specializing in minis of a Norse theme. I founded my business in 2008 and have been producing miniatures ever since. In that time I have produced some 300 odd figures for my various ranges of Men, Elves, Dwarves, Goblins, Halflings, Orcs, Demons and Undead of all kind of role for each of those range themes. I have now run 9 kickstarters and have fully delivered on 7 ( 2 campaigns were canceled prior to reaching the funding goal ). I always strive to produce figures of the highest possible quality and have gone to great lengths and even significant personal difficulty to see to it that I deliver fully on all of my promises.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have a great deal of experience in the running and delivery of kickstarters and 7 years experience in the industry dealing with all the various aspects of producing and marketing miniatures. These aspects include design, sculpting, coordinating production, quality control, packaging and shipment. I maintain a very close relationship with my customers and backers well after the sale is made.\nI have experienced difficulties in previous kickstarters but have run several successful campaign which delivered on time and to expectation, but even in the kickstarters which delivered late I have always delivered in full as promised.\n\nI very keenly understand the hurtles which may present themselves during the fulfillment of kickstarters and I am ready to deal with any of them. You can rest fully assured that I will deliver your rewards to you if you back my campaign.

This is a work in progress, does not represent the final game and is subject to change. Any and all feedback is welcome - good luck, doctor!\nPS. This build has only had limited testing and optimizations but wanted to give everyone something to sink their teeth into, so expect some bugs!\n    Hi! We're the Thar Be Monsters team! Founded in 2015 by three AAA industry artists that wanted to create a game inspired by colorful and gross Saturday morning cartoons.\nOur team has worked on a lot over the years, from indie to AAA -- including League of Legends, Darksiders 2, Enter the Gungeon, and Ori and the Blind Forest! We've been around the block before, and we've got a serious passion for making games.\nCheck us out in our team bios below!\n  Blubber Busters is a 2D action platformer with an emphasis on frantic combat. Space whales have problems -- Lots of problems -- from bizarre bacteria to pesky parasites and everything in between, and they need your help! We're big fans of 90s-era combat platformers, and are especially inspired by games like Mega Man X, Metal Slug and the Metroid series! Blubber Busters is definitely snuggled up in that same blanket and we aim to make something that stands toe-to-toe with the greats.\nWhales come to you for help, and who are you to turn them down? Pick your patient and get out there! Each afflicted whale effectively works as a single stage with its own set of problems and objectives you need to solve to help get it happy and healthy again. A whale with a stomach ache may have you trekking down into the stomach to clear out unwanted debris while dodging digestive acids, or a parasite infection may have you wiping out swaths of critters before taking on their queen!\nSwap between crew members to tackle each situation. Switch to the more agile Eva to climb a wall, burn through barriers with Rudy's flamethrower or kick-start machinery with some juice from Emmett's defibrillators! Or just cycle between all of them to give infections a thrashing. There's no I in team, so get to know the whole crew!\nTreating patients earns you cash! As you play, the whales who show up to your orbital \"waiting room\" will start exhibiting more and more acute symptoms; you'll have to quickly decide how to optimize your exploration for upgrades and needs for cash against the growing demands of your patients.\nDeck out your crew! Enhance their abilities, making them stronger, faster, and more effective! Give their health a boost or add some pep to their punches.\nUpgrades don't come free and some need to be researched! You'll even be able to research entire new abilities to help you do what doctors do best.\nUpgrade your space station! Your run-down clinic can't function without a solid crew and proper resources! Expand to accommodate more patients or build a lab to analyze new infections and get an edge with the latest tech -- spend that down-time growing your space station from a gutted wreck into a thriving medical facility!\n      Humans and space whales live in harmony among the stars. Why? Because we need them and they need us. The whales provide us with transport across the galaxy, access to resources and materials, and much-needed companionship and in return they only ask that we keep them healthy. For being such an ancient species living in deep space, they're not too bright and get themselves into all sorts of trouble.\nTheir docile and cuddly demeanors make for perfect company in the lonely expanse, so what kind of monster WOULDN'T do their best to make sure they're happy and disease-free?\nNaturally, clinics have sprung up across the stars offering these magnificent beasts relief from whatever ails them in return for a number of goods and/or services. Usually cash.\nA new mutation has started manifesting in the patients causing all sorts of aggressive behaviors in these otherwise sweet and docile space beasts. One by one, clinics across the stars have started to go dark. Rudy -- a lowly janitor -- was on break and missed all the murder, so he's all the poor whales have left!\nFollow Rudy and his crew as they take on the burden of keeping these burdensome beasts healthy in a world packed with guts, eccentric aliens and quack doctors! As you race to save every patient that comes to your door, a sinister plot is unfolding... Good luck, Doctor!\n       Help us go beyond the stars and expand our game's content, platforms and more!\n  Swap that formal medical education for hands-on experience! Ethics are great and all, but you have a job to do. Your patients, lovable lummoxes as they are, don't just get sick from disease\nThey suffer from indigestion, cholesterol-caked blood vessels, alien head-colds, virus-ridden prosthetics, infected bowels, and even genetic disorders. Do what needs to get done, there\u2019s no medical board watching over your shoulder in space.\n  We're set to launch on Steam for PC, but with your help we can reach stretch goals that can get the game on other platforms like Mac, Linux, PS4 & Xbox One!\n Art style? Art style.\nEarly exploration of a mother parasite\nComing at you with 2D hand-painted comic-book-style graphics! Our art style is completely derived from the mind of our epic concept artist, Avery Coleman.\nAvery's work is inspired by comic book artists like Joe Mad (creator of Battle Chasers and artist for various Marvel comics), which we think will give Blubber Busters a style and unique look all its own!\nFinal concept of a mother parasite\n  Layers of 2D depth in a 3D world!\n      All of our characters and enemies are 2D renders of animated 3D models. This gives us the freedom and speed of 3D animation while still harmonizing with stylish 2D effects!\nLook at all that harmonizing\nWe\u2019re extremely excited to announce that Chris Christodoulou - of Deadbolt and Risk of Rain fame - will be joining us to compose the soundtrack for Blubber Busters! He's coming at you with a pumping retro electronic sound that jives with our art style perfectly!\nChris has already been helping us set the tone for Blubber Busters, and we have three audio tracks that we can share!\n          What are Add Ons?\nAdd Ons are additional goods that you can include with your pledge (plus shipping if needed) If you pledge a minimum of $15 - you can add any of the following to your pledge amount.\nFor t-shirt sizes & any additional info needed - expect a backer survey from us! Thank you!\n  The Game\nGet a digital PC copy (PC/Steam) of Blubber Busters! All backers at the $15 Resident Rank or above will be able to choose on which platform (out of the unlocked release platforms) they'll receive their codes.  \nDigital Wallpaper Set  \nA collection of desktop wallpapers featuring Blubber Busters' colorful cast of mis-adventurers and medical malpractitioners.  \n\nEarly Beta Access\n Play the game before anyone else!

Everyone gets access, but you get to be a part of it.\nPhysical Softcover Art Book  \nIt's the art book... but you can hold it on your HANDS. In meat-space! Digital-world cyber-beings need not apply; this is only for us creatures of flesh and bone.  \nPhysical Hardcover Art Book - Signed -  \nLike the softcover art book...but harder. It also comes with some signatures from the team! Limited availability in the Surgeon tier or higher.  \n-Limited Edition- T-shirt  \nIf the horrors of middle school taught us anything, it's that being cool is being EXCLUSIVE, and what better way to exclude others than by all of you guys wearing this limited-edition Blubber Busters tee! Available only through the Kickstarter!  \nPhysical Box Copy of the Game (+ manual & OST)\nThe ultra-definitive version of the game. A handsome box containing a physical copy of the in-game manual and the OST CD! Feel its weight in your hands and make space on that shelf!  \nAlternative Outfit  \nWhile the other janitors are in their orange suits, you can stand out from the crowd!

Own one of the original sketches by Avery drawn during the development of the game. (Pencil not included)\nName & Portrait in the game\nThere are tons of dead surgeons in space whales these days, but oddly enough not many with names... until now. You can be one of these dead surgeons with a unique story of how you died! \nName a Disease \nThe first disease ever named after a still living person! If that's what you want to name it... Work with our team to create a gross, silly and unique name for your disease to go down in history! *cough* \nArt Direct an Enemy Design\nJoin forces with the BB team as an Art Director for a day & help design a flesh devouring enemy for the game!\nBecome an NPC in the game  \nWhat's more exciting than talking to an NPC? Talking to one that IS YOU! Become one with the lore or just mop up the floor. Work with us to figure out your place at the Orbital SVP!   \nBreakdown\n  As a funding solution, Kickstarter affords us the most independence, control, and artistic freedom. Most of our team is remote, but our core members will be moving closer to work under the same roof. We'll all be basically living in a small, hobbit-like commune scrabbling with one another for an extra flavor-packet for our ramen noodles. But we'll be making a game - a game that we really believe in!\nThis game is our passion project, and what you see already is the culmination of months of work through late nights, weekends, and some missed engagements. Most of us were wholly unpaid thus far - the others, paid out-of-pocket for their services by the core team. These out-of-pocket funds are starting to run dry, and so it's come to the point that if Blubber Busters is to become a reality, we need to focus on it - full time.\nWe strongly value being transparent and listening to our community - a great trait that we've learned from working at Riot. We want to make sure that our game is just as fun for us as it is for you, and we hope for your feedback throughout development to make that happen! \n Budget \n                                                                                                                                                                                                              Please feel free to reach out to us through any of the above channels, and if all else fails, you can shoot us an email at info@tharbemonsters.net\n   Special Thanks!\nShout out to all those that have helped us through our earlier stages of development - Alex Redfish, Kevin Culler, Priscilla Tsang, Khai Tran, Skylar Surra, Mike Ton, Terry Nguyen & Ai Tran.\n& thank you to Koujaku for the Ferr2D tool!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur biggest risks come from the fact that game development is sometimes unpredictable and when that happens scheduling can be effected.\n\nLuckily, every core member of the team has more than five years experience working in game development and has seen at least one shipped title. We've been through the scoping and development process and we're confident that we've budgeted time appropriately given our funds. Should several designs take more iterations than previously estimated, we have several publishers and investors already courting us, so we're willing to entertain those options to ensure that the best

The concept is something retro and nostalgic that is intended to evoke images of famous paintings like J. Howard Miller's \"We Can Do It\" and Rockwell's \"Rosie the Riveter\".\nWe have a fantastic list of classic character archetypes with a fresh take on the designs from the mind of concept artist Chris Walton for the core set as well as numerous stretch goals. Care is taken to size the figures so they are compatible with other models from the most popular manufacturers within the 28mm range of heroic sizes. Babes\u2122 are cast in the finest lead-free pewter to assure as much of the detail of the original sculpt is preserved. All models are supplied unpainted and some assembly may be required.\nSculpts by Patrick for Reaper, Dark Sword, Privateer Press, and Bombshell\n               Shepherd - sculpted by Chad Hoverter\n        FUSE LEVEL - This backer level allows you to choose from any of the rewards available or unlocked, a la carte.

This will allow you to choose duplicates of the same Babe if you prefer. The Bomb Kit includes all of the FREEBIES shown here and may receive more as future items are unlocked.\nDETONATOR LEVEL - You may choose which 13 Babes are included in your Detonator from any of the ones listed in the BABES section. This will allow you to choose duplicates of the same Babe if you prefer. The Detonator level includes all of the FREEBIES shown here and may receive more as future items are unlocked.\n  These items may be added at any backer level for the listed pledge amount shown.

He has some critters in the Bombshell range along with a couple of Babes and we are happy he has been able to help with this current project.\nArtist - Chris Walton is probably best know for his iconic character designs on games like WARMACHINE\u00ae and HORDES\u00ae as well as designs for Z2 Inc, Forrest-Pruzan Creative, Sodapop Miniatures, Paizo Publishing LLC, Exato Game Studios, Reaper Miniatures, Antarctic Press, Atlantis Studios, Eos Press, and Scrambled Eggz Productions.\nArtist - Mary Profitt knew as a child she wanted to be in the creative field and started painting and drawing at age three. During high school she won three Gold Key awards at the national level and went on to study fine arts in college. Being blessed with a natural talent she has done commission work in portrait oil painting, pencil drawings, and painting in acrylics, so miniature painting was a natural fit.\nPainted by Mary Profitt\n  Artist - Elizabeth Beckley-Bradford is a professional miniature artist living with two cats, three dogs, a lizard of unusual size, and her husband, who puts up with paint brushes sitting around the house. She's been painting miniatures for several years and loves bringing miniature characters to life. There's nothing better than sitting down to a game of D&D with some wonderfully painted mini's to vanquish evil monsters!\nPainted by Elizabeth Beckley-Bradford\n  Artist - Matt DiPietro is one of the most prolific miniatures painters working today. He started his career as the lead studio painter for Privateer Press, and shaped the painting of Warmachine and Hordes for nearly a decade. These days he makes his living teaching the next generation of miniature artisans, and creating miniature art for private collectors.\nPainted by Matt DiPietro\n  We will charge shipping after the Kickstarter based on the actual costs. This will be collected via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. DO NOT INCLUDE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO COVER YOUR POSTAGE PAYMENT IN YOUR PLEDGE AT THIS TIME!\nAny funds collected through the KS system are reduced by 10% when KS takes out their fees. This means that any funds collected to cover postage are 10% less than what is actually needed to cover postage IF the postage rates do not increase between the time of billing and shipping. (Postal rates have increased on us during our projects at least once prior to fulfillment. In one case the rates increased twice!)\nAfter the campaign ends, backers will be able to select their rewards via the pledge manager. Shipping costs will be calculated and collected at that time. You will also be able to select additional rewards options at that time if you wish.\nPostage will be billed by region when backers make their choices via our pledge management system.

My task is to come up with new designs and concepts for our artists to work from. With the success of our first Kickstarter the stars have aligned for me to produce a good number of brand new designs. Bobby Jackson has sculpted some imaginative models for you this time around. Fortress Figures is again producing our figures so you know the quality will be top notch. Along with my brother, Jeff, and my sister, Ronda, we are reaching out to the miniatures gaming community to support our second Kickstarter Project.\nFor this Project we have General Aurora Salt, Robots, and several more specialists.  For our backers in the U.S.A, we also offer FREE shipping for pledge level ending the campaign at $50.00 or more.  \nFREE U.S.A SHIPPING\n  Stretch Goal Bonus\nMetal Castings\nWhite metal production copies of the new models from Fortress Figures. \nProduction Copies\n Scale\nOur figures are for the commonly used gaming scale of one inch is equal to five feet scale.  This makes our human figure 28mm from toe to eye or 30mm from toe to top of head if standing up.  It is our goal to keep our figures a consistent scale throughout the ranges.   See photo below for a size comparison to figures produced by other popular gaming companies.   \nScale Comparison\n Last Minute Add-On\nAdd On BDUs\nStretch Goals \nOur intention for this kickstarter is to add a stretch goal to each pledge of $50.00 or more as each funding level is achieved.  All backers at pledge levels of $50.00 or more at the end of the campaign will receive all stretch goal rewards included with their pledge rewards on fulfillment.  The stretch goal rewards will be awarded in addition to your pledge level and will be automatically included with your shipment when your pledge is fulfilled.  The stretch goal models shown are between 15mm and 25mm tall and will fit comfortably on a 25mm base that will be included for them.  All stretch goal reward models will be cast in white metal.   \nStretch goals by Bobby Jackson and Tim Hill\nPLEDGE LEVELS\nWe have a variety of pledge levels to choose from including all new figures if you participated in the last kickstarter and don't need duplicates  and an ALL IN level if you missed the last one so you can catch up.   The $10.00 level is for the General Aurora Salt and her trusted genetically enhanced covert operative companion Sergeant Pepper.  It should be noted that this $10.00 level is not eligible for stretch goal rewards.   \n         Add-Ons\nIf what you get in the standard pledge is not enough, and how could it be, you can add any number of additional models to you pledge as desired.  \nShipping\nOn the end of the campaign, each backer will be issued a coupon code via e-mail to redeem at our on-line shop for your pledge rewards.  This worked out very well last time around seeming to be the simplest way and also allows for some last minute additions if you desire.  Shipping fees are not included in the pledge level and will be collected at the time you redeem your coupon code.  \nEstimated shipping fees:\nU.S. $0 - $5  (U.S. receives free shipping for $50 or more pledges)\nCanada $15\nOther Destinations $20\nCustoms fees, duties, taxes, tariffs and or additional charges incurred at the shipping destination by the receiver are the responsibility of the receiver.  RBJ Game company cannot accept any responsibility for additional charges imposed by the taxing authority of the legal jurisdiction of the receiving residency.     \nWhy Kickstarter?\nKickstarter has proven to be the best method to launch and expand a new range of miniatures.  Kickstarter has enabled a renascence in miniatures by allowing manufacturers to appeal directly to their fan base.  With the success of our last Kickstarter at more than double the funding level, we were able to have several more figures sculpted, printed and put into production than we initially planned.  The funding level directly affects the expansion of the range with our backers literally funding our efforts with their venture capital.  What better way to participate in creating the miniatures you want while supporting the hobby we love?   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere is practically no chance of this project not being fulfilled once the successful funding level is reached. Fortress Figures is one of the oldest professional miniatures production companies with more than three decades of experience casting the finest white metal miniatures and capabilities for casting several thousand figures per day. All molding and casting is done in house by our dedicated staff of three well experienced individuals. Only the sculpting and printing is outsourced and the sculpting portion of the project is already completed. We still have some 3D prints that need to be printed (the standing at attention guys and the stretch goal figures), a few master molds and a half dozen production molds remain to be finished before casting your figures can begin. We have again, allowed ourselves what we consider to be an extraordinarily abundant amount of time to complete this project. A quick look at our previous Kickstarter will show that we shipped rewards to backers a full three months ahead of schedule last time around. \n\nAn unforeseen event, though unlikely, could be, well, unforeseen. Should anything go awry, I pledge to keep our backers up to date on any delays or scheduling changes that might occur so no one is left guessing about what is going on.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "General Aurora Salt", "descp": "You receive General A.

It has been used to make games like Hyper Light Drifter, Hotline Miami, Risk of Rain, Gunpoint, Undertale, and many, many more.\nAbout Me\nI love teaching people how to make games. I'm a top instructor on Udemy with over 20k students happily learning to make their own games and over 2100 perfect 5 star reviews.\nMy Udemy courses can be found here.\nReviews\nThe Course\nI\u2019m creating a new step-by-step video course about making a turn-based RPG using GameMaker Studio.\nCourse Benefits\nSave time by starting with everything you need\nHave fun as you make this beautiful, turn-based RPG\nBe confident as you master advanced GameMaker techniques\nFeatures\nAfter finishing this video course you will be able to:\n\nDesign tiled overworlds\nProgram a character that can easily navigate the overworld\nIncorporate complex in-game cutscenes with multi-page dialog boxes\nCreate beautiful room transitions\nControl turn-based battle mechanics\nManage character progression with level-up system\nAnd much more\nWho is this Course for?\nThe ideal student for this course is someone who has used GameMaker before but wants to learn more advanced techniques. This course is not for absolute beginners to GameMaker. If you haven\u2019t used GameMaker before, then check out my other courses first. This course is not easy. It will take a significant amount of work but it will also be fun.\n\nKickstarter?\nWhy am I here on Kickstarter when I have already created 3 successful courses without it?\n\nThis course is quite a bit larger in scope than my other courses. To help with the larger scope I\u2019ve hired Toby Dixon as a contract pixel artist. As you can see from the screenshots, his art is amazing! I\u2019ve been paying him using my business savings but I\u2019m running low. I will be using the funds donated via Kickstarter to continue paying Toby as he creates the different worlds and animates the many monsters.\n\nAlso, a Kickstarter allows me to create a more flexible pricing structure before the course is placed on Udemy (see pledge tiers).\n\n\nThanks\nThank you so much for your interest in my course! Please consider pledging your support! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are many challenges that might arise during the course creation process.

Because of the extended development cycle, resources that I had planned to use on the game ended up going to the course.\n\nThe game itself (what I have) has an interesting story that I wish I could share. I paid a writer from Telltale games to help me create it and I think it is really great. The artwork (by Toby, and Clement) is also amazing. However, . I don't want to deliver a bad experience. Playing the game itself isn't fun and I've lost my passion for trying to make it good.\n\n\n\n(not including paypal) and of those .

These awful cards may allow you to draw from the fantasy deck, take a card from the discard pile, plagiarize by stealing fantasy cards from opponents, or even destroy an opponent's hard-earned story elements by killing off their Protagonist, poking holes in their Plot, or by de-antagonizing their Antagonist.\nRead the rules here: Rulebook\nIncorporating the unique and absurd humor of Justin and Mitchell Lucas (@AwfulFantasy), with gameplay designed by Adam and Brady Sadler (Warhammer Quest: The Adventure Card Game), and featuring the art of Conor Nolan, Awful Fantasy: The Card Game is an awfully great blend of quick, elegant card play, beautiful illustrations, and absurdly hilarious fantasy satire.\n                                                                         @AwfulFantasy is a comedy fantasy and science fiction social media account guided by Justin Lucas and Mitchell Lucas. Each tweet satirizes or parodies classic tropes and cliches in fantasy and science fiction writing.\n\nHere's what some people have said about us:\n  Awful Fantasy: The Card Game was designed to be simple and super easy to learn. Here's an example video for your first round of gameplay:\n            The Protagonist, Antagonist, and Plot cards are each based on characters or events from popular @AwfulFantasy tweets. This allows us the opportunity to make sure Awful Fantasy: The Card Game is as silly and colorful as it can be.\n\nSome of the tweets we've chosen are... weird (okay, most of them). It would most likely be a challenge for most artists to translate. We knew it was very important to find an artist who could not only capture the absurdity of our tweets, but to help us visualize the characters and places we come up with in a spectacular way. Conor Nolan does just that.\nConor Nolan is an illustrator based out of New York. From editorial illustrations for Vice Magazine, comic covers for Dark Horse Comics and Boom! Studio, and promotional material for MTV he has covered a varied range of clients and projects. Nolan's work can be seen on posters, apparel, comics, magazines, newspapers, beer labels, and record covers. And now, it can be seen on Awful Fantasy: The Card Game.\n \n              (Conor's original line drawing for Gru'k. This is what the Original Line Drawing Level reward will look like)\n    Every copy of Awful Fantasy: The Card Game will include all unlocked stretch goals.\n            We've partnered up with established tabletop game designers, and good friends, Adam Sadler and Brady Sadler to make Awful Fantasy: The Card Game not only funny, but fun.\nAdam and Brady Sadler have been working together creatively since before they could walk. This twin brother design team has worked together on staff at Fantasy Flight Games, contributing to game lines such as Descent: Journeys in the Dark Second Edition, Mansions of Madness, X-Wing, Gears of War, and Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay.\nTheir first published design together was FFG's Warhammer Quest: The Adventure Card Game. Since moving on from FFG, the Sadlers have begun working with other publishers, both in the tabletop and digital world.\n\nWe're excited to have the help of such big influencers in the tabletop gaming world to really help make Awful Fantasy: The Card Game a funny, enjoyable gaming experience.\nAt the Adventure Level pledge tier and above, backers will receive The D\u00e6mon Queen's S\u00e6cret Tower, a very special Awful Fantasy roleplaying adventure specifically designed to be compatible with 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons!\nHere's the story:\nOnce a regal and respected Queen of the Land of Orboz, Queen F\u0153tida instilled the opposite of fear into the hearts or her loyal subjects. Faced with the knowledge that she comes from a royal line rife with incest and illegal underground dragon fighting, F\u0153tida was dethroned by the Lord of a lesser house who uncovered her family\u2019s darker past. Queen F\u0153tida, residing in an old, long abandoned s\u00e6cret tower in the Dargon Mountains, is now a servant of Necrosa, and has turned from her love of Contemporary Impressionism to the somewhat Darker Arts\u2014NECROMANCY!\nThe Undead are invading the peaceful townships and cities of Orboz, consuming the flesh of the living, and ever spreading their vile dark magic and unpopular religious beliefs. Queen F\u0153tida has been spotted as a shade near the Dargon Mountains, and tale is told she still lives, most likely raising the dead as her own Personal Undead Army of Revenge!\nIt is up to a small band of heroes (you) to find Queen F\u0153tida and put an end to her Necromaniacal ways. In the Dargon Mountains lies the decrepit heart of the dark magic that plagues Orboz like a plague. In this metaphorical heart is where you must end the Dark Queen\u2019s evil, vengeful plans (by killing her).

Troopers\nThis is Jeff Rodman, AKA Ironrook from Fortress Figures, and I have made miniatures all of my adult life. I generally work behind the curtain for other miniatures companies but now it's time to step from behind the curtain and create some pet projects I have had rolling around in my head for some time. Along with my brother, Ben, and my sister, Ronda, we are reaching out to the miniatures gaming community to make our first Kickstarter a success. We're confident that with this first success under our belt, we will continue to realize additional great products that could not have been possible without you.\nTo get the ball rolling, we have a set of S.T.A.R Trooper miniatures. The core set of 5 poses is already done and ready to go. These miniatures were designed by my brother Ben and the 3D sculptures were brought to life by veteran sculptor Bobby Jackson. The molding was done by me at Fortress Figures and personally hand cast by us.\nS.T.A.R. Trooper Heavy Weapon\nMiniatures provided are not painted.  Slotted plastic base provided for each miniature not textured.  Miniatures produced in spin-cast white metal or spin-cast resin.  \nPLAY\n\nMetal Castings\nHere are some of the production copies of the white metal troopers.\nProduction Copies\nSCALE\nscale comparison\nMiniatures are sculpted to the commonly used 28mm gaming scale.  \nREWARDS\nWe are envisioning our stretch goals to reflect our ability to add additional poses as funding levels are reached.  As each goal is achieved, we will add new poses to the core set with the first level adding two figures and each level thereafter swapping out redundant poses for new different ones with a final goal of 10 figures of 10 different poses.  Additionally, we have an early bird incentive and two bonus figures to add to the core group.  \nWhat do I get?\nWhat do I Get?\nPainted models for display only.  Models provided NOT PAINTED.  \nThe early bird pledges also include the limited edition medic.  The resin sets will include the same figures as the metal sets including bonus stretch figures and medic in resin.  \nEARLY BIRD MEDIC BONUS FIGURE\nDigital render.

There is practically no chance of this project not being fulfilled once the successful funding level is reached. The Core set is already done and ready to distribute. The greatest risk may be a delay in creating the new poses if funding levels go high enough. Ironically, that means that the more successful the project, the more likely we may not meet the shipping dates. We have allowed ourselves what we would consider an extraordinarily abundant amount of time to finish completion of the project. Should something go awry, we are used to working under pressure and feel we can mitigate any issues that may arise. Additionally, I pledge to communicate to our backers any delays that might take place so no one is left in the dark.

Available in XS.S.M.L.XL.XXL.XXXL If you do not see your size or fit just PM me and we can work it out.\n  Boy Theif is included in the Warband pledge but is also available as an $8 add-on.\n  Girl Apprentice is included in the Warband pledge but is also available as an $8 add-on.\nMighty Jorik is included in the Warband pledge but is also available as an $8 add-on.\n  Ejryvindr the Far Seeing is included in the Warband pledge but is also available as an $8 add-on.\n  Ase Arvidrson is included in the Warband pledge but is also available as an $8 add-on.\n  Red Gunhildr is NOT included in the Warband pledge but is available as an $8 add-on.\n  Frodulf is NOT included in the Warband pledge but is available as an $8 add-on.\n  Pretty Laerke is NOT included in the Warband pledge but is  available as an $8 add-on.\n  Wolf Set is NOT included in the Warband pledge but is available as an $15 add-on.\n Modular Thug set is NOT included in the Warband pledge but is available as an $25 add-on. Pictured above are the works in progress. The finished set will include a sprue of 6 heads ( 2 hooded, 2 bare, 2 capped ) a sprue of 7 right hand weapons ( 3 clubs, 2 axes, a sword, and an open hand ) and a sprue of 7 left hand options ( an open hand, a set of javelins, a dagger, a torch, a handaxe, and a buckler ) along with the 5 modular bodies pictured above.\n Berserker Shaman is NOT included in the Warband pledge but is available as an $8 add-on.\nBerker Shaman apprentice is NOT included in the Warband pledge but is available as an $8 add-on.\nRaging Bear is NOT included in the Warband pledge but is available as an $15 add-on.\nWith this kickstarter we plan to fund the production of a broad selection of fantasy themed heroes for use in skirmish table top gaming. To begin I have a set of 5 semi modular warriors fitted for universally interchangeable weapons and heads, a Ranger, and a Wizard. With a Swordsman Hero, a thief, and an apprentice underway to complete a warband of 10 figures.\n Backers can pledge for one warband for $55.00 ( a $75.00 RRP value ) or for individual figures for  $8 each ( a $9 RRP value ) or for one set of the modular Warriors for $25 each ( a $30. RRP value ).\nIt is my intention to create more Norse themed figures to compliment this warband as funding allows. These plans include 5 semi modular Thugs fitted for universally interchangeable right and left hands and heads, a berserker with two handed axe, a shield maiden, a female ranger, an alternate male ranger, a female wizard and an alternate male wizard. As thee figures are funded they will become items available for selection as add- on rewards.\nI will be posting pics of the various Works In Progress of these figures as the campaign develops.\nSHIPPING IS NOT INCLUDED IN ANY PLEDGE. \nDO NOT INCLUDE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO COVER YOUR  POSTAGE PAYMENT IN YOUR PLEDGE IT WILL * NOT * BE APPLIED TO YOUR POSTAGE.\n Any funds collected through the KS system reduce by 10% when KS takes out their fees. This means that any funds collected to cover postage are 10% less than what is actually needed to cover postage IF the postage rates do not increase between the time of billing and shipping.\nPostage will be billed by region upon time of readiness for delivery. All postage fees must be paid before shipment can be made. Rewards will be posted from the US to all backer's addresses.\nPostage ESTIMATES by region;\nUS $7.00 and $15.00\nUK EU $10.00\nAU / NZ/ ROW currently unspecific.\nRed Box Games are not responsible for any customs duties, taxes or fees incurred as a result.\nUS rewards will be shipped via USPS Priority mail and will thus be charged according to the box size needed to safely package your rewards. We do not fuss with extraneous packaging much in the effort to keep postage costs to a minimum to pass those savings along to our backers. We will however package your items safely and securely.\n  This project IS EU friendly! All UK and EU rewards packages will be shipped from a fullfillment point in the UK. And I am working on securing an Australian fulfillment point for Australia as well.\n  Production is being handled by a very reliable and proven partner Valiant Enterprises located in the US. Valiant has proven again and again that they are proessional, prompt and reliable.. The figures will be produced via traditional methods of spin cast metal and hand poured resin where applicable. Production for metal miniatures is typically very swift and is generally less subject to the delays of foreign production.  \nFinally, I am just a guy with a dream to create great fantasy miniatures and possibly one day a great fantasy game. I have worked very hard in this industry for a long time with a long well established line of great products to show for it and the dearly treasured support of a lot of really great people. I have had some hard knocks and things are never easy, but in the end I could never be happy doing anything else. This is where my heart is. I am not at all afraid of hard work and I will always see to it that I deliver on my promises. But in the end I am still just one guy with a dream, skill, and dedication to a goal, I still need your help. I have my ability to sculpt, my ambition to create, my dedication to this purpose, the help of a few very talented friends ( Thanks for all the great Art Dave! ) The support and patience of my darling Wife Kristy, and the help of many wonderful people such as yourself willing to chip in what you can to help make it all possible.

With each warband set containing all the basic elements needed to play a game of any of a variety of popular table top skirmish games. At the outset, each starter box will contain 5 semi modular warrior figures repeated three times per box for a total of 15 miniatures. These figures include 4 weapon and shield warriors and one archer.\n  It is my hope to be able to expand the offering in each starter box as the funding allows me to afford more molds. These expanded offerings might include additional troop types for expanded tactical variety or alternate sculpts to replace repeated sculpts for greater variety.\n  The first Warband Set offered is Njorning hirdmen set which includes ;12 hirdmen warriors, and 3 huntsmen. Each of the hirdmen is semi modular being fitted for universally interchangeable heads and right hand options. The right hand options included with the set are 2 swords, 2 axes, a mace and a spear repeated three times in the box for a total of 18 weapon options. There are also 6 different head options repeated three times in the box as well for a total of 18 head options. The archer model is fitted only for a modular head.\nBackers can add to their pledge as add -ons are unlocked by managing the value of their pledge upward by the amount necessary to cover the cost of the desired items. Each new add-on posted will be accompanied by a full detailed description of the contents and the cost of the add-on itself.\n SHIPPING IS NOT INCLUDED IN ANY PLEDGE.\nPostage will be billed by region upon time of readiness for delivery. All postage fees must be paid before shipment can be made.\nRewards will be posted from the US to all backer's addresses. We are not responsible for any customs duties, taxes or fees incurred as a result.\n  The miniatures are cast in a high quality hard PVC plastic produced by a well established and experienced production contractor which handles the manufacturing for several well known table top gaming companies.\n Plastics manufacturing has made a great deal of long strides in the level of quality they are able to capture and reliably produce in miniature scale. many very impressive products have been released recently showcasing just what is possible in the medium. I am very confident both in the examples I have had on hand for comparison and in the research I have conducted over the past 4 years that plastic is definitely the way forward for Red Box Games and the plans I have for future projects.\n I am still however a very cautious person when it comes to new ventures as I have endured some very hard lessons in the past teaching me to take it slow at first. To that end I want to keep this campaign manageably modest in scope. I feel that the plan I have laid out is sound and deliverable within a reasonable span of time and the product offered is excellently made and designed specifically for the medium. I am confident that I will deliver to your full satisfaction.\nFinally, I am just a guy with a dream to create great fantasy miniatures and possibly one day a great fantasy game. I have worked very hard in this industry for a long time with a long well established line of great products to show for it and the dearly treasured support of a lot of really great people. I have had some hard knocks and things are never easy, but in the end I could never be happy doing anything else. This is where my heart is. I am not at all afraid of hard work and I will always see to it that I deliver on my promises. But in the end I am still just one guy with a dream, skill, and dedication to a goal, I still need your help. I have my ability to sculpt, my ambition to create, my dedication to this purpose, the help of a few very talented friends ( Thanks for all the great Art Dave! ) The support and patience of my darling Wife Kristy, and the help of many wonderful people such as yourself willing to chip in what you can to help make it all possible.\n\nThank you very much for your time, your support and encouragement.\nCheers,\nTre'", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis project will face different challenges than what I have experience with in that the production will be handled in a foreign country and the medium is plastic rather than metal.

There is a Facebook group called Relicblade Official Battle Friends where you can share photos of your miniatures, and connect with the Relicblade community. \nRelicblade.com is the other spot to keep an eye on as we move into this glorious new dawn. \nThanks for making this game a reality. \nYour Friend,\n Sean Sutter\nRelicblade is a small scale miniatures skirmish game created by Metal King Studio. Players take command of heroes and monsters as they battle to claim magical relics of the ancient world.\nWill you lead bold heroes on their righteous quest for hope? Or will you harness the unbound fury of the Pig Men; whose craven lust for destruction is only matched by their love for snacks?\nThe \"Bold Adventurer\" two player battle game includes everything you need for start playing full-size games of Relicblade out of the box.\nFully Illustrated Rulebook\nWave 1 Deck: 14 Character Cards, 32 Upgrade Cards, 2 Reference Cards, and 6 Relic Cards\nAll Wave 1 Heroes\nAll Wave 1 Pigs\n6 Dice\nKickstarter Exclusive Relic Card\nALL UNLOCKED STRETCH GOALS: Relic Miniature, Thief Character, and more to come!\nThis set is the best way to start playing the game right away!\nRelicblade is quick to learn and fun to play. The characters are represented on the board by detailed 30mm miniatures while their statistics and abilities are shown on convenient character cards. The real depth comes in as players choose from 25 unique upgrades to specialize their characters to gain a tactical advantage. Will you choose to specialize your cleric as a support healer, or bestow her with powerful magic weapons to bring low the adversary?\nBefore the battle players choose characters and upgrades.\nBattles are fought over an unidentified magic item that has drawn the characters to that spot. When characters are finally able to seize the relic it is drawn randomly from the Relic Deck. Relics grant an unnatural boon and are used just like upgrades, however they far surpass any upgrade in power. But if the character wielding the relic is disabled anyone can pick it up.\nThe Knight grabs the Sword of Ruin\nStandard games of Relicblade are played on a 2'x2' area, players usually only field between three and six characters, and the games only last around 45 minutes. Games are fast paced, dynamic, and exciting. It's not unusual to play several games over the course of a couple drinks. \n The Relicblade Core Game has been FUNDED! We are now working our way through awesome new stretch goals!!\nRelicblade is super rad. I know you're going to love it. If we can get a bunch of people behind this project it's better for everybody. You want more characters... I want more characters. So let's do this!\nWhenever we unlock a new goal everyone backing at Bold Adventurer ($89 early bird, and $99) and above will get it added to their rewards for FREE. Everyone wins!\nOH SNAP! I love you guys. Free Relics for everyone!!! (almost)\nRad new hero. Free with \"Bold Adventurer\" Pledge ($89/$99) or more!\nWhat goes into making new characters?\nOh, I'm glad you asked. The Metal King Studio YouTube channel has a whole web series dedicated not only to this question, but to the production of this very character! Follow along as I draw, sculpt, and produce the thief in an aptly titled series called... Thief.\nRelicblade is a good old-fashioned miniatures game. \nPlayers dive into the miniatures hobby as they assemble, paint, and play the game. Relicblade figures are made of high quality white metal, and the miniatures are supplied unassembled and unpainted. The process of customizing and painting the characters is part of the awesome collaboration between the creator and players. The ruins of Relicblade are largely unexplored, so the depths of this savage world are open for players to invent and discover.\nMiniatures are supplied unassembled and unpainted.\nWhat scale are the figures?\nRelicblade miniatures are made at the 30mm scale. That means from foot to eye level a character should stand at around 30mm. It's ever so slightly larger than the well known Warhammer scale, but slightly less \"heroic\" ( giant hands and weapons). \nRelicblade figures lined up with other favorites from my collection\nHow Relicblade miniatures are made.\nRelicblade is 100% independent and creator owned. However, the process for creating these metal miniatures is extremely similar to the production process from your favorite miniatures companies. I even use the same prototyping company, mold maker, and caster as some of my most loved games.\n1. The first step is to create a character that is at least vaguely interesting. For the Questing Knight I did a bunch of research on knightly arms and armor. I especially lost myself in YouTube videos of Battle of the Nations and other HEMA groups.\n2. Using ZBrush I create a 3D model of the figure. From the very beginning I have to consider how the model will look at the tiny 30mm scale and how it will work for mold making and casting.\n3. Rapid prototypes are a quick low resolution 3D print of the model. Using the Form 1+ printer I was able to see what was working and what wasn't. It's extremely important to see how the parts fit together and make sure everything is at the appropriate scale.\n 4. Once the design is finalized and all the issues are resolved, the files are sent to VisionProto for high resolution prototypes that can withstand the mold making process. These prototypes are quite costly, but offer unmatched detail and fidelity.\n5. The high resolution prototypes are sent to a mold-maker and caster. The master and production molds were made by Fortress Figures. With the molds established the figures are cast by the hundreds in high quality white metal.\n6. The final stage is when players paint the figures and play out legendary adventures. The final product is a collaborative art piece that unites friends, gamers, and hobbyists around the world.\nGreetings friends,\nMy name is Sean Sutter. I am a professional freelance artist and illustrator, and the lead artist on the comic book series B-Squad: Soldiers of Misfortune. As a freelance artist there can be gaps between jobs or even simple hours here and there while you wait for a sketch to be approved. Relicblade was more or less born in these gaps. \nB-Squad Volume 1 Cover Art by Sean Sutter\nI've been obsessed with tabletop miniatures since I first walked into a game shop and saw that they existed. And like many of you, I harbored dreams of creating a game. 20 years later I realized that I'm still crazy about miniatures, but I am also an able illustrator and writer. So I taught myself how to sculpt miniatures in ZBrush.\nZBrush is extraordinary. I've studied drawing my entire life. I did over ten years of weekly figure drawing and have a bachelors degree of fine art. But drawing has always been a process of translation for me. While drawing I work to translate a three-dimensional idea into two-dimensions, which is always the major challenge. But once I learned the basics for ZBrush I was finally home. My thee-dimensional imagination just needs to be transcribed into ZBrush... I can't adequately describe how artistically fulfilling sculpting is.\nI sculpted that bear while I was waiting for a poster design to get approved by the Crocker Art Museum.\nGame design has been a joy, as well. I put forward core design principals and set about creating a game. As I got deeper in the game design I obsessively asked and answered questions through every step. I would toss and turn at night trying to figure out gameplay mechanics. After months of fevered game-craft Relicblade was complete. Now, each time I play it I am delighted at how well Relicblade meets its design goals.\nAsset drawings, card prototypes, and probably a pot of coffee on my desk.\nWhile learning to sculpt and filling notebooks with ideas took place in the gaps between freelance gigs, the hardcore making of the game had to be a full time endeavor. In July of 2015 I started creating Relicblade full-time. It's been a crazy adventure so far, and I really hope with this Kickstarter it is just the beginning. I have ideas coming out my ears and a really great game. \nNow that the rules, cards, and figures are in print I can take a step back and just enjoy the game instead of critiquing it. We are still finding crazy new upgrade combinations and party-builds. Just last night I had one of the most exciting games to date. \nUltra fun Relicblade demos at Great Escape Games in Sacramento. That's me with the cool orange hat!\nI hope you will step out on a limb to try this new game. There are a ton of great games out there, but I know after a few games Relicblade will be one of your favorites, too. Plus, supporting independent artists has intrinsic value. ;)\nYour Friend,\nSean Sutter\nClick photo to go to the B-Squad campaign page!\nB-Squad is a crazy action-packed comedy that follows a band of misfit mercs on dangerous and ridiculous missions. In volume one the squadies did battle with a hive-mind of wiener dogs, and a dangerous band of James Cameron cosplayers. While Eben Burgoon is writing each issue he spins a six-sided whale-bone die to determine which of the six main characters will be killed on the mission. Ridiculous. Dangerous. Expendable.\nGetting paid to draw for B-Squad empowered me to believe in myself and make Relicblade. In B-Squad Volume 2 we will be empowering a new batch of artists! When you #BackBSquad you aren't just getting a book. You're showing artists that they deserve to get paid, and encouraging them to make something awesome.\nIf you back both B-Squad and Relicblade, you'll also receive an exclusive Relic Card modeled after the very dice that slays all the B-Squad characters, The Pequod!\n What's a Custom Character Card?\nYou can tell me about a D&D character you used to play as, or any character you imagine. Then I will do an original illustration of that character. But the fun won't stop there! I will also stick that character in a character card and make up some sweet rules and stats for your them!\nNow that barbarian you have fond memories of playing back in high-school can roam the wild lands of Relicblade!\nYou get the original illustration and a professionally printed copy of your card (Character, or monster, or relic, or whatever...)\nPorter McScotch, B-Squad writer Eben Burgoon's Dwarf Bard\n But, what if I want a miniature of my awesome character?\nIt costs money, but it's pretty amazing seeing your characters come to life this way. Also, these high pledge levels really help support the studio.\nCustom hand-made Relicblade terrain:\nYou want Relicblade? Say no more. I will personally hand craft a 2'x2' board for you in whatever setting you want. I'll do my best studio-quality work to get you a seriously awesome board. The 2'x2' panels hang on your wall while not in use and make really crazy 3D fantasy landscape paintings. It's an absurd amount of work, but you're worth it. I'll even paint up a full set of Relicblade figures to match your adventure setting. Frozen city, ancient tomb, or lava fort? Follow your heart.\n Here is a little chart that should help clarify the pledge levels.\nWhat are Add-Ons?\nAdd-ons give Backers the option to add extra bits to their rewards for a little extra money. This is the best opportunity for people to grab extra components to optimize their Relicblade experience.\nThe Two-Player set is specially designed to give you everything you'll need to get the full Relicblade Experience. But if you want a few extra Pigs this is the way to get the promotional deal available only through the Kickstarter.\n Using the Marketplace below you can look at what is available and adjust your pledge accordingly. I want to make sure you get everything you want out of this Kickstarter campaign, and I believe this will help. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf you say, \"I want to make a game.\" people will ask \"have you thought about Kickstarter?\"\n\nKickstarter has become an everyday occurrence for the tabletop gaming industry. Which has, I believe, very positive implications for the future of independent games. But that also means you can get ahead of yourself and start asking for money before you really have a game. I don't want to ask you to support a project that is just an idea. Even if I think it's a pretty good one.\n\nThis risks and challenges section of the campaign is probably the part I've fought the hardest for. At the outset of a project like this you have to ask yourself a lot of questions, and you have to look at each obstacle as gatekeepers. Just past those cold hearted sentinels was the game I wanted to make. Bringing a game from drawings and notes all the way to miniatures and rulebooks was daunting, but it's done. I already went through my delays. There were countless challenges that I wasn't expecting, but I crushed them. And I worked on this game full-time for eight months before it was ready for Kickstarter.\n\nThe game is done. Relicblade is being played by gamers across the entire world, and they love it. But I was only able to make 100 copies, and the game currently exists with the minimum number of characters needed to play. If I write four emails I can have the Relicblade two-player sets ready to ship in three weeks, because everything is done. But I want to make the game bigger and better too. If we can unlock the stretch goals we can do just that.\n\nMaking new characters means new illustrations, sculpts, 3d prints, molds, rules, and cards. So the risks and challenges aren't completely eliminated. But I know how to take a sketch and turn it into an excellent game. Delays will almost certainly happen, but I'm ready...

Go to www.skyheartcomic.com to stay up to date on the project!\nI'm Jake Parker, and I'm making SkyHeart Book I: The Star Seed. \nSkyHeart is an all-ages graphic novel inspired by my favorite movies and comics. If you liked Miyazaki's Nausicaa, Star Wars, Tokien's The Hobbit, and Indiana Jones, then you just might become a fan of SkyHeart. \nSkyHeart will be a 7.5 x 10 inch 100+ page book that comes in both soft and hard cover editions. \nThe book is being written and drawn by me and is scheduled to be finished in May of 2016, and shipped out to backers in October of 2016.\nFor years I've been developing this project on the side, but it was so big, and so involved that it scared me! I felt I wasn't ready to create this book. \nAfter years working in animation as a concept artist (Horton Hears a Who, Rio, Epic) and comics (Flight, Missile Mouse, Rocket Raccoon) my skills as an artist and storyteller got better. I feel like I'm finally at a level now where I can take on a project like this and do it justice.\nSo...I'm going for it!\nThe Idea for SkyHeart was planted in my imagination over 15 years ago while on a road trip though the Arizona desert. I imagined the desert floor vanishing, leaving only an abyss of clouds with the rock formations suspended above them in the air.\nFrom that seed of an idea grew an entire world of characters and their struggles, with mythologies, cities, and technology fleshing out the rest of this universe.\nI love classic tales of adventure, of good versus evil, and struggles with real consequences. Which is why I look to films like Star Wars, Nausicaa, Castle in the Sky, and Indiana Jones, and books like the Hobbit for inspiration. Just because a story is all-ages, doesn't mean I can't enjoy it as much as my kids do!\nSkyHeart takes place on Airth, a world literally torn apart by a pre-historic war between the gods who created it. That war left the planet divided into 4 realms:\nThe Stratos, a chain of islands high in the sky where the Sylph people live.\nThe Rimland, a massive ring of continents and giant islands where most of the inhabitants of Airth live. Wake, our main protagonist, lives here.\nThe Abyss, a stretch of atmosphere filled with incredible cloud formations and tiny floating islands. Limberg and Grimm are from here. \nThe Core, an ocean covered rocky sphere filled with colossal caves. The Tengru, monsters and beasts, and the Dark Lord live down here.\nIn that great ancient war, the beings of Light were able to defeat the Shadows and banish them to the core, but not without a great cost. Losing most of their godly energy, they left Airth to search the universe for more power. Their children stayed to protect what was left of Airth from the evil trapped in the core. \nThousands of years later these pre-historic events have become myth, and the inhabitants of Airth are consumed with their own wars for power. \nHowever, deep in the core, the Shadows have not forgotten, and have begun sending their agents to the surface to harvest the people of their life force. Once enough of this power has been taken the Shadows will rise again to destroy the rest of Airth and start a new world.\nWake and his crew set off to find the Star Seed with the hopes of both saving Wake's mother, and the world of Airth. That is, if they can beat Malsang and his sinister tengru to it's secret location. \nHow Do Add Ons Work?\nI'll be using Backer Kit to handle rewards and add-ons. Here's what you do:\nAdd up the total of your selections (plus shipping if it applies) \nClick \"Manage Your Pledge\" in the upper right corner (blue button) \nAdd the total of your Add Ons to your pledge amount. You don't need to change the tier you've selected \nYou are done! Later you'll get a backer survey asking how you spent your add-on dollars and for other pertinent info. \nThank you!\n\nI'll be updating the add ons and adding more if the project funds and we hit stretch goals. I want to add a map of Airth, a poster, and more, so check back.\nI'm asking for A LOT of money. I've got a great youtube video here that outlines where all this money is going and how I arrived at this number. Basically, half the funds are going to the production of the content, and the other half is getting the books printed and shipped. \nHere's a breakdown of where the funds are going:\nPrinting: $12,000 This covers getting the books printed and shipped to my house. (15.4%)\nProduction: $42,000 This covers my time writing and drawing the book, paying a colorist, editor, and building the book and getting it ready for print. (53.8%)\nFees: $8000 This covers Backer Kit, Kickstarter and Amazon fees. (9%)\nShipping: $16,000 This covers packing up the books and shipping charges. I will be shipping the books PRIORITY MAIL to US backers to ensure the safe delivery of each package. International orders will all be sent FIRST CLASS. Orders will be packed in a bubble wrap sleeve, then put into heavy duty cardboard case. I talk all about how I ship things in this video. (23.4%)\nThis book will be produced in the spring and summer of 2016 and will be delivered to backers in September of that same year. Here's a rough timeline of the production:\nNovember: Run the Kickstarter\nDecember: Finish the SkyHeart manuscript\nJanuary - June: Drawing and coloring\nJuly: Building the book, and prepping for print\nAugust - September: Printing the book\nOctober: Packing and Shipping\nHi I'm Jake Parker, and here's a little bit about me written in third person to sound official: \nJake Parker is an illustrator and cartoonist. For the last 17 years he's worked on everything from animated films to comics to picture books. His credits include the animated films Titan A.E., Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs, Horton Hears a Who, Rio, and Epic. \nHe illustrated the New York Times bestselling book The Astonishing Secret of Awesome Man, and went on to also illustrate The Girl Who Wouldn't Brush Her Hair, The Tooth Fairy Wars, The Little Snowplow, and most recently finished his first children's book that he also wrote, Little Bot and Sparrow which will be available in fall of 2016.\nAlong with children's books Jake also draws comics, and recently finished five issues of Marvel's Rocket Raccoon. His Missile Mouse graphic novel series, published by Scholastic, have sold over 100,000 copies. His own self-published comics anthology The Antler Boy and Other Stories was funded through Kickstarter at over $85,000. \nJake is the creator of the Inktober challenge and World Art Drop Day, with both initiatives involving thousands of artists across the world. He's taught at Brigham Young University and is the co-founder of SVSLearn.com, an online art school specializing in visual storytelling. \nHe and his wife Alison live in Provo with their five kids, two cats, and five chickens.

But lets see what other fun stuff we can add in the remaining time.\nI will add all the original stories I created when I was first conceiving Shiver Bureau.  Fully illustrated covers and sequential pages.  I think this will be at least 20 extras pages of content.  This will be awesome to have in the book just for the sure zaniness of the stories, but it will show the Shiver Bureau in its infancy.  The story, the characters and even me grew a lot in the 8 years it too to get to this point.  I think these pages will really showcase that growth.\nPrints of cool interior pages, panels and the cover will be sent out with all physical shipments.\nAll books will be printed in glorious hardcover!\nThe hardcover will be upgraded to include some tasteful embossing.  My plan is to emboss the logo, Trish, and Pickle.  Also I will start compiling a massive concept art book for Shiver Bureau volume 2.  All backers who gave $10+ will get a digital PDF copy of this book when complete.\nUpgrade Level twooooooo! The book will get a spot UV treatment.  I think that is something like a spa day for graphic novels.  I want to add a shiny, 'invisible' ghost to the back cover.   A spooky friend you only spot out of the corner of eye when the hair raises on the back of your neck.\nShiver Bureau: Welcome to London is a 150 page graphic novel.  That's 150 pages of full on story.  There will be some bonus content in the back as well. It will be a paperback unless we raise enough to afford a hardcover.\nBest part is, this first volume is completely finished.  I'm not waiting for the artist to art, or the colorist to color, or the letterer to letter, or even the snozzleblurrer to snozzleblur.  I just need cash money to get it printed.\nSuitable for all ages with parental guidance.  There is some cartoon violence and monsters lurking about.  But nothing worse then a Saturday morning cartoon.\nThis is the first volume of a trilogy (possibly a quadrology) but this volume is self contained and serves as an introduction to the world, characters, and the awesome.\nIt's also a webcomic that you can read for free at http://shiverbureau.com/\nThe world is overrun with ghosts and it's up to the Shiver Bureau to keep things under control. But everything isn't as it seems, the bureau is corrupt and there are things lurking in the shadows that are far worse then the shivers.\nThat's where Pickle, Trish, Mr. Todd and Oliver come in.  The is Pickle's first day in London and already he's been attacked by shivers, fallen out of a blimp and been shown up by his assistant*.  How much worse could his day get?  A lot worse...Welcome to London.\nPickle is taking over the London headquarters.  Not only does he have to deal with shivers, but he needs to clean up the bureau, deal with a power hungry minister, get back his assistant*, and there are rumors about missing kids.  I think Pickle needs a vacation (wink wink volume 2 wink nod wink wink wink wink...sorry got something in my eye).\nThere are a wide assortment of characters, but the main dogooders are...\nPickle is an Inspectre, a rare type of person with the ability to lay shivers to rest.  He is overly confident, but has the skills and the mouth to back it up...most of the time.  Pickle thinks he's the hero of the story...\nLuckily, Trish is there to remind him that he's not.  Trish is the power house of the group.  She's not just a brute though, she has more than enough smarts to keep Pickle and his mouth in check. *Not Pickle's assistant.\nMr. Todd fixes everything that Trish and Pickle break.  He also makes some really cool toys.  Don't let his size fool you, he's no good in a fight...he's a pacifist and very huggable.\nOliver is the next generation.  He embodies the best of Pickle, Trish, and Mr. Todd. Maybe some of their faults as well.  When he's older, he will be someone to reckon with...if he can live that long.\nWell I'm me, silly...\nMore info?  Okay, my name is Walter Ostlie and I am a part-time storyteller who dreams of retiring early to create new worlds and new possibilities, to boldly go where no cartoonist has gone before...or go where they went but put my own twist on it.\nShiver Bureau is my second graphic novel.  My first is Cubicles: The Movie: The Graphic Novel...or just call it Cubicles.  It's a sci-fi comedy about two office workers who get dragged across the universe.  It's pretty funny, you should read it.  It's available on Comixology.  You can read the first chapter for free and the entire novel is only 4 bucks.  That's like 80 pages of hah hah hilarious uproar for 4 bucks. What?  What!\nhttps://www.comixology.com/Cubicles/comics-series/6589\n$10 - Not only do you get a digital copy of the story, but also some overloaded bonus content.

Not only is it styling and profiling, but it's functional.  No shirt, no service.  Any pledge 60+ will have their name printed in the 'Thank You' section of the book.\n$65 - This is like the $35 tier but even cooler.  Instead of sketching in the Shiver Bureau book, I will sketch on a separate 6\" x 8\" card stock. You pick any character you want and I'll draw them looking their coolest.  Keep it to a single character.  Background are at my discretion.  You also get the signed print copy and overloaded PDF.\n$90 - This is like the $35 tier but even cooler.

Some of them make games. Some of them play games. All of them are helping make the video game community one of the most vibrant and exciting collections of humans on Earth.\nI made this video with Christian Cicerone over four days of shooting and five days of editing. Imagine what we could do with your backing and support!\nI can't wait to show you what these people are really like, what drives them and how they do what they do.\nWe've begun production on the following two episodes:\nEpisode 01: FOX, BIRD, BEAR. Spry Fox just released the clever word game \"Alphabear\". Before that, its \"Triple Town\" made waves (and attracted controversy). With less than a dozen developers working form all over the world, this mid-sized indie studio is trying to turn modest successes into long term survival. Their next game, \"Steambirds\" could be the breakout they need. \nEpisode 02: FAMILY BUSINESS. John Romero created \"Doom\". Brenda Romero has worked for decades as a game developer. Now they're working with young Donovan on \"Gunman Taco Truck\" and helping others learn the joy of game making. This is the story of the Romero's \"Family Business\".\nAdditional episodes will include the stories of:\n  And if we're funded to our second stretch goal (way less than twice our original goal), we'll be able to make six more episodes \u2014 and you can help decide whose stories we tell next!\nSTAGE OF DEVELOPMENT is the next major webseries from my company, Flying Saucer Media. I've worked for 25 years in media production. I was the head writer and producer of TechTV's \"The Screen Savers\"; editor-in-chief of the six-time Webby Award winning escapistmagazine.com; co-founder of Polygon.com; and creator Polygon's \"Human Angle\" webseries, short documentaries about people in video games.\nSTAGE OF DEVELOPMENT is picking up where Human Angle left off, with an entirely new 6-episode series chronicling the real human stories of video games. And to ensure that no one can pull the plug, call the shots or change the course, I'm asking for your help to fund this series.\nProduction of STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT has already begun. I've spent my own money shooting the first two episodes of this series. And pre-production has begun on several additional episodes. \nSTAGE OF DEVELOPMENT will be six episodes. We're asking for your help to raise $192,105. That's a very precise figure, and one we're confident in. We're experienced video professionals with over 25 years experience making high-quality video. We know how much it costs, how hidden costs can stack up, and how to avoid surprises up-front. We've provided a detailed breakdown of why we're asking for what we're asking below. I think after reading and hearing more about what we're trying to accomplish you'll agree we're aiming for a reasonable goal.\nEach 7-10 minute episode of STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT tells a new story about an interesting, exceptional or revolutionary personality in the video game community. What is it like to be an indie developer working with a dozen other people around the world? What kind of child grows up raised by some of the most famous game developers in the world? How do you make a game better than your first game, when your first game was one of the best reviewed games out there? And what kind of person has millions of fans just for making videos on YouTube? STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT will answer all of these questions and more.\nThe first episode will publish the same day this Kickstarter closes, whether or not the series is funded. New episodes will then follow every month.\nAt Flying Saucer Media, we run very small crews. For STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT, we'll be working with freelance contributors for almost every shoot, but the core team will be:\nProducing six, separate short documentary films covering subjects all over the world is no easy task. I know. I've done it before. I know exactly how much that will cost, how long it will take and (most importantly) how to do it right.\nI'm asking for a lot of money. I'm asking for a lot of trust. I hope you agree that telling these amazing stories is worth a little of both.\nCrew fees and travel are the biggest expenses. The second biggest expense is backer rewards, that's the stuff we're making and shipping to you for backing this project. I'm borrowing Robert Khoo's excellent analysis of how much that sort of thing costs. I also borrowed Robert's math on how much Kickstarter and credit card companies will charge me for the privilege of taking your money. It's a lot! \nStage of Development is going to cost us $138,650 to produce (rounded to the nearest dollar). That includes crew fees, travel, contingency (in case something breaks) and fees for music composition and licensing.\nAdding in the cost to produce the awesome backer rewards ($38,406.05) and the amount Kickstarter will charge to raise the remaining sum ($15,049.76) we get to $192,105.\nOr put another way:\nThe portion of this chart that looks like Pac-Man is how much we need in order to produce Stage of Development.\nThe rest is how much we need to spend in order to raise the amount we need to produce Stage of Development.\nThe first episode of Stage of Development will be available to backers as a digital download the same day this Kickstarter closes. No excuses.\nEpisode 1: September 16 (The day this Kickstarter closes)\nEpisodes 2-6: One per month, every month. \nThat's not bluster. The episode been shot and is currently in the final stages of post-production.\nWe are planning to publish additional episodes every 3-4 weeks. Right now we have all of the six episodes booked and scheduled for production and post-production.\nFancy pledge chart.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe only serious risk is that someone's schedule might change, forcing us to adjust our production schedule, possibly costing us more or affecting the amount of time it will take to finish an episode.\n\nThis is the sort of thing where experience leads to a much lower risk. I've done this before. I've run into these issues. And I know how to work around them and plan a schedule and a budget keeping in mind that things may change.\n\nRealistically, there's a 100% chance that something will happen differently than we've planned it. But there's a statistically zero chance that a disruption will be so severe that it will impact our schedule or budget so severely that we can't adjust. \n\nI don't want to say \"never\" but I've been managing schedules and budgets for decades. Both \"Press Reset\" and \"Human Angle\" came in on time and under budget. As has every production I've ever been a part of. If STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT were to run over budget or take longer than I expected, it would be the first.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Russ Pitts\n2 created \u00b7 28 backed\nRuss Pitts is a veteran producer with experience in almost every entertainment medium.

This lead to the creation of Sketch Wallet - a leather wallet that holds a sketchbook. It comes in black or chocolate brown leather with a matching sketchbook.\n If there is a combination of things you'd like, but don't see in the rewards, just do the math and give me a note explaining what you want. For example, if you'd like one sketchbook and a t-shirt, just select the t-shirt and then add $4 to your pledge for the sketchbook. \n I've been using a prototype Sketch Wallet for two years and absolutely love it. I can't imagine not having one. It doesn't matter where I am, the doctor's office, a restaurant, or wherever. If I have a few moments I'll doodle a few sketches instead of surfing the net on my phone. I've come to cherish all these quirky little drawings and many of these raw ideas I've developed further into games I create for work and other projects. This has brought the joy of drawing back, and has helped me improve my skills.\nThe Sketch Wallet is very flat and is designed to maximize the area of a standard men's back pocket without feeling bulky or heavy.\nAttention writers and note takers - now you have the option of lined paper! After the campaign you will receive an email survey and can pick blank sketch books or lined paper books.\nWe respect craftsmen everywhere, but I wanted to use local factories to ensure the best quality and ethics possible. Our wallets and sketchbooks are made in the USA.\n STRETCH GOALS!\nUNLOCKED! If we hit $35,000 every reward level, small or large, gets a small metal page clip. \nUNLOCKED!

The factory and printers are already in place. The wallet dies and hot stamps have already been made. Not only have a few prototypes been made but I manufactured a small batch just to work out all the kinks in manufacturing before the Kickstarter campaign began. It's extremely expensive to manufacture a small batch, but I felt it was crucial to ironing out any kinks in the pipeline beforehand. While I don't have any leather product experience, I have, over the years, designed, manufactured, and shipped hundreds of products made of metal, plastic, and rubber.

I know you've shared a lot already, but will it be possible for you to post more pictures clearly drawing the comparison between the two colours? Maybe against different backgrounds, and how a Moleskine Cahier looks on each of them, or how sketches look on both sketchbooks with wallet border, etc? I hope my request makes sense.
