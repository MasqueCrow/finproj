[{"backer": "Mark McKenna", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "He is Camriddeon. The Torn Soul. He is the savior of Dannisfire. Overthrew a tyrant.  Married a princess. Established peace throughout the realm.\nHe is the despot. Who killed a king. Bent the land to his rule, and watched it fall to ruin.\nHe is a hero. A villain. Lover, liar, mage, demon. Depends who you ask.\nHello everyone! We are so excited to launch our Legends of the Realm series with Camriddeon, the Torn Soul. A new epic fantasy series in a world of magic, demons, true love, and the questions that tear at the heart.\nThis 50 page tale follows the life of Dannisfire's enigmatic mage. The Torn Soul is a hero, a tyrant, a lover, a traitor. He toppled a kingdom, established greatness, and watched it all fall to ruin in fire and ice. Was he good? It depends on who you ask.\n\nWhat is in Legends of the Realm?\nA 50 page epic fantasy, launching the Legends of the Realm series.\nSpecial Edition includes Legend of the Realm's first short story \"Camriddeon and the Leighman Lurkers.\" +8 pages of content!\n2 amazing prints from artist Evan Scale\nVariant cover from legendary artist Tony Moy\nAnd more!\n\nJack Holder's website\nEvan Scale's Website\nInstagram\nJohn Robinson website \nMicah Myers website\n\nPraise for Legends of the Realm\nCamriddeon reminds me of the great fantasy adventure novels of my youth. There's a great reverence to fantasy-pulp past, but also with an eye to the future.\n- Russell Nohelty, Wannabe Press Creator of \"Ichabod Jones: Monster Hunter.\"\n\"This story is a blast, and it holds so much promise for an expanded world of fun, magic, and adventure.  Make it happen!\"\n- Greg Wright, Creator of \"Monstrous.\"\n\u201cAs short stories go, CAMRIDDEON AND THE LEIGHMAN LURKERS has everything you need. Great fantasy. Dynamic art. And a character that intrigues as well as captivates. I look forward to more adventures in this interesting world.\u201d\n- Frank Martin, writer of \"The Polar Paradox,\" and \"The Last Homicide.\"\n\"Cammrideon and the Leighman Lurkers is fantasy at its finest. Jack Holder writes it from an interesting narrative perspective that makes the story seem both familiar and new, and Evan Scale\u2019s art is pitch-perfect, epic and poignant at the right moments. It is one of my favorite stories in the Creator Connections, Panel 1 anthology\"\n- A. A. Rubin, Comic Book School.\n\n\n\nWhy Start with the Torn Soul? \nLegends of the Realm is, in essence, about people and legacies. With new history, and changing dynamics in the world, we are reevaluating how we see figures like Founding Founders, Dr. King, and even our own ancestors' role in history. I've personally struggled with how to look up to figures, as we can now see the flaws so much more clearly.\nAnd I spent a lot of my college and grad school years with my foot firmly planted in my mouth, wrestling with this in ways that made others uncomfortable. And so I turned to a man that, for a while, lived only in the back of my mind. A good man, certainly. But angry, passionate. Human. Trying to change a world the only ways he knows how.\nCamriddeon is my attempt at bringing forth a high fantasy that looks at the mage from all sides. We have seen the warrior hero, striving against evil, just as we've seen compromised schemers, lovers, and those who do bad things for good reasons. What happens when the greatest hero the realm has ever seen, had his story told by others? Would he be the hero? The villain? Or simply a man?\nWhy Kickstarter?\nThis will be my ninth Kickstarter project, and quite possibly the one that I've given most of myself towards. The Legends of the Realm team is coming here because this platform, and you the kickstarter community, is one of the best audiences we have ever seen. \nWith Legends of the Realm, this series is a wonderfully huge undertaking that I and the rest of the team cannot wait to bring to life. \nWhat will the funds be used for?\nMaking comics is a rewarding, if difficult venture. Putting together a 50-page comic is  one of the biggest individual efforts we've ever done as a team. Funds will be utilized to make this comic, and the upcoming series that follows a reality. \nCheck out a free preview of Torn Soul below!\nPage 1\nPage 2\nPage 3\nPage 7\nPage 8\nPage 10\nPage 17\nPage 18\n\nWhat kind of rewards can I get?\nBack at this level because you believe in our work.

Born of Magic follows the lives of four groups of adventurers. Students, friends, daughters and heroes, all living in a world that is increasingly more fantastic. To survive, they will take on dragons, old gods, a lightning ghost, and the Fairy King who remembers them all too well.\nEach is called a fool. An idealist. A blight upon the world.\nJust don't call them kids. \nWhy Faith?\nHave you ever wondered about why you have faith? Or wanted to know more about what that part of your life could mean?\n             \"Why Faith?\" is a wondrous, full-color comics anthology, jam-packed with stories from creators of all faiths, identities, and backgrounds. Edited by Jack Holder, and featuring some of the greatest creators in the business, these 30 stories bring to bear the question of why one should (or should not) have faith, and how it truly changes the very nature of life.\nSo what's the Plan?\nAfter funding we hope to build the book and special edition throughout the summer.\nWe hope to print the books over August, and start shipping in September\nAnd with your efforts, start the next arc of Legends of the Realm\nThank you all so much for reading.

He's super-strong, he can fly, and he's adored by millions. He's also FLAT BROKE. Busted. Bankrupt. Being a superhero is surprisingly expensive and it's hard to keep a job when you keep disappearing for hours at a time to save people's lives. \n\nSo Captain Stronghold goes on national television to reveal his secret identity and to turn to the people he's saved countless times for help... financial help! Yes, the world's most beloved superhero is launching a crowdfunding campaign to fund his super heroics!  After all, those costumes don't just pay for themselves!\nRed, White & Broke is a superhero story that's not a superhero story. It's a look at the (literal) cost of being superhero, all told in the wryly comic writing style of #1 bestselling author and award-winning podcast host Mike Spring. Along with rising comic art star Dennis Tirona, Mike has crafted a 24-page debut issue that dives deeper into the logistics of being a superhero than you've ever seen before. Who makes the costumes? Who pays for them? How many jobs can one superhero hold? Are secret identities worth it? All these questions and more will be answered in Red, White & Broke: Confessions of an American Superhero #1!\nVariant Cover by Ian Chase Nichols (The Tick, TMNT)\nVariant Cover by Drew Moss\nWe've got a great selection of rewards for backing this project, including three different covers to choose from.

Gave myself a few months to learn as much as I can, made some sample pages then got my first sequential gig in October that year and it\u2019s been freelance work ever since. I always aim for a clear page as I want the story to be seamless, and my art style is definitely on the cleaner side and not too anatomically exaggerated, although I am also developing a style more keen on the noir look.\"\nDrew Moss (Variant Cover Artist) - Drew Moss is an Illustrator based out of southeastern Virginia and has worked for Dynamite (Red Sonja/Vampirella), IDW (The Colonized, The Crow, MASK) Dark Horse (Creepy), Oni Press (Terrible Lizard, Blood Feud) Image Comics (Copperhead) and various other publishers.

We're estimating about a month after the Kickstarter ends to get the coloring done, another two weeks for lettering, and then it's off to the printers! But that's where the uncertainty comes in. With the Coronavirus and postal delays, we're hesitant to put an exact date on it, but we want to get this book into your hands ASAP! We'd like to say you'll have them in December, but with the delays mentioned above, we're projecting January just to be safe, but are very hopeful you'll have them before that!

We are offering three new books! The first is the latest art book by Mark Schultz, Carbon 4. The second book, Xenozoic by Mark Schultz, is a handy to hold and affordably priced new printing of his classic Xenozoic Tales comic series. The third book focuses purely on the legendary Al Williamson, titled Strange World Adventures! Plus, we have four premium prints on offer: one by Williamson, and three by Schultz. Please read the details below for more  information. Thank you for visiting!\nUNLOCKED! Stretch Goal #1! Book binding upgrades! Please see the stretch goal section below for details.\nUNLOCKED! Stretch Goal #2! Bonus Sketcbook! Please see the stretch goal section below for details.\nCarbon 4 is the latest collection that highlights Mark Schultz\u2019s favorite recent and past works. From the barbaric past to the nightmarish future\u2014from the ocean\u2019s depths to the farthest planets\u2014Carbon 4 features Mark Schultz\u2019s most-ambitious works to date!\nMark Schultz unleashed! Inspired by the otherworldly pulp stories of his childhood in the 1950s and \u201860s, Schultz continues to draw inspiration from the adventure, fantasy and science-fiction genres of that imaginative period. With its visions of romanticized space exploration, this time continues to be a primary influence on his artwork and in this new collection, where the focus is on life on other worlds.\nCommissions, personal works and archival art can all be found within the pages of Carbon 4!\nWhile many of these new visions were created purely for his own satisfaction, Carbon 4 also features Schultz\u2019s most recent commissions and commercial illustrations. As always, Xenozoic\u2019s Jack and Hannah are featured prominently. A number of the works include preliminary sketches as well as the finished pencils, residing alongside their completed brush-and-ink companions. Two gatefolds highlight a pair of the artist\u2019s most-ambitious commissions to date\u2014illustrations of contrasting literary interpretations of Martian life.\nTwo gatefolds showcase new works by Schultz!\nCarbon 4 also opens the Schultz archives to highlight obscure pieces not included in his previous volumes from Flesk. Rarely seen imagery from the first decade of his career is finally revealed after years of requests from fans. The drawings include covers done for the SubHuman series as well as for Superman, Aliens and Predator. Also presented are sketchbook page samples that offer insight into the artist\u2019s thought process. As a bonus, fans will find \u201cTime Troubling,\u201d a little-known three-page teaching aid made for a long out-of-print book about how to tell a story through comics. The breadth and scope of Schultz\u2019s evolution as an illustrator is fully represented by these dynamic images spanning his thirty-year career.\nCarbon 4 book interior artwork reproduced from the originals!\nA stunning first collection in a new series showcasing the career of legendary artist Al Williamson.\nThis first compendium in a new series is the perfect introduction to Al Williamson\u2019s work. You will find samples that span his fifty-year career along with anecdotes and historical details salted throughout. Cover art, interior pages, drawings and sketches\u2014plus photographs of Al and his friends posing as reference for his sequential art\u2014are included. This volume contains a mixture of both his most-obscure and best-known works, all meticulously reproduced from the original art.\nUntil now, this captivating original artwork has only been seen by those fortunate enough to visit the Williamson studio in person. For the first time, readers will be able to view the artist\u2019s most-cherished works. Williamson\u2019s love of 1920s and 1930s adventure, fantasy and science-fiction pop culture\u2014and his admiration of artists such as Flash Gordon creator Alex Raymond\u2014grounded his drawing technique and storytelling, which evolved throughout his life. He was able to take these inspirations and carry on the legacy of the past masters while becoming a unique icon in the industry. In this collection, readers will be able to witness Williamson\u2019s development as an artist.\nArtwork from the originals revealed from the Al Williamson studio.\nComic pages and covers from Al Williamson's fifty year career are showcased.\nThis 352-page Xenozoic book is a handy-to-hold collection of all the classic Xenozoic Tales comic stories written and drawn by Mark Schultz. This is a new printing with a new cover. Welcome to the Xenozoic Age, a post-apocalyptic landscape where dinosaurs are the lords of the Earth\u2026and humanity is the endangered species!\n\u201cWhat a strange new world, to have such creatures in it!\u201d\nForced into hiding by a global ecological cataclysm, humans emerge from their underground warrens half a millennium later to discover that the Earth has been totally transformed. All of the familiar flora and fauna are gone, replaced by a radically altered natural order populated by rampaging dinosaurs and strange new creatures. It takes guts, grim determination, ingenuity and a whole lot of old-fashioned luck just to survive, much less thrive, in this alien wilderness\u2014all qualities that ace mechanic Jack Tenrec, lovely scientist Hannah Dundee and their friends possess in abundance.\nA new collection of the classic comic series by Mark Schultz!\nBut even the worthiest of these hardy souls are hard-pressed to surmount the obstacles presented by their new homeland. And when those trials are further compounded by the underhanded and selfish actions of the cutthroat human scavengers they encounter, even the best-equipped and bravest among them might not endure.\nXenozoic artwork reproduced direct from the originals!\n\nXenozoic combines lush and richly realized ink-and-brush artwork with a pulp-fueled narrative to create an action-packed fantasy\u2014an unrelenting adventure that also serves as a subtle cautionary fable concerning the unforeseen consequences that shortsighted present-day decisions might have upon future generations.\nSequential sample pages from the Xenozoic story.\nThese four signed 13 x 19\" museum quality gicl\u00e9e prints feature three recent artworks by Mark Schultz, and one classic piece by Al Williamson that has been colored by Steven Roberson. These prints utilize 290 gsm acid free matte paper that is  water resistant and they are printed with archival and fade resistant inks.\nThe limited edition prints on offer are \"Dark Portal,\" \"Epic,\" and \"Tigress of the Southern Seas\" by Mark Schultz. The Schultz prints come signed and numbered. The Al Williamson print \"Lair of the Golden Princess\" comes numbered. If you pledge for 1 or 2 Mark Schultz prints, you can provide us with your choices when we send out the Kickstarter surveys.\nPlease note that the books and the prints ship separately. \nWe will include an 8 x 6\" mini-print with all book pledges of $25 or more, one different mini-print for  each of the three books. A total of three bonus prints if you get all three books!\nAll Kickstarter stretch goal and bonus items are limited to one per backer.\nStretch goals are a way for us to offer an additional thank you as the campaign grows. Thanks to our supporters we have been fortunate enough to hit our initial goal on day one. We are pleased to announce our first stretch goal.\nUNLOCKED! Stretch Goal #1! Book binding upgrades!\nWe will add 4\" french flaps to all three paperback books. Plus, we will add an upgraded custom ordered material to use for the  quarter-binding on the hardcover Al Williamson and Xenozoic books. For the Carbon 4 hardcover we had already budgeted for the Arlin boards with a blind stamp under a dustjacket to match volumes 1-3. Please see update #1 for more details and sample pictures.\nAs an art book publisher, I am someone who is always eager to add  improvements to the book binding along with upgraded material that is  not typically found on books in the stores. A good thing about the  Kickstarter platform is that your support allows us the confidence to  add these features that could not be done otherwise. We hope to hit this  stretch goal so that we can research and implement these book  construction upgrades. The art of the book is just as important as the art that is found within the pages. --John\nStretch Goal #2\u2014Bonus 16-page Sketchbook! UNLOCKED!\nWe will include a free 16-page, 5.5 x 8.5-inch paperbound saddle-stitched sketchbook collection titled The Al Williamson and Mark Schultz Astounding Sketchbook with all book pledges of $25 or more! This will feature previously unseen blue pencil drawings from Schultz\u2019s personal sketchbooks, and also sketches and preliminaries by Al Williamson. Both Williamson and Schultz will have 8 pages worth of material each. This bonus item is for those who make a book pledge of $25 or more and is limited to one per backer.\nAdd-on anything to anything! An Add-On lets you pledge for more than one tier by adding the price of any additional tier to your existing pledge. Say you want to include an extra hardcover signed book? Or maybe combine a few tiers or make your own selections? Please contact us through Kickstarter and we can provide you with a grand total that includes the shipping. If you have any questions we are here to help.\nWe expect to have your pledges shipped to you in February 2021. It takes approximately three and a half months for everything to be printed and then to be delivered to us. We will ship them to everyone immediately upon their arrival at our Flesk warehouse in Santa Cruz, CA.\nHere is a detailed schedule and outline so that you know what to expect.\nAugust 2020: Finalize the designs of the three books. Mark Schultz completes a few new pieces to include in his Carbon 4 book.\nSeptember 2020: Finish the book designs and package the books for the printer. \nOctober 1, 2020: Turn in the books to the printer. Review the proofs and approve the book for the press.\nNovember 2020: Make the premium prints, the Kickstarter bonus items. \nJanuary 2021: Receive the books from the printer. Begin shipping them to our supporters.\nFebruary 2021: Packages begin to arrive at your homes.\nAll books are shipped within the U.S.A. by USPS Mail and will include tracking. Premium signed prints shipped in the U.S.A. will ship  by USPS First Class mail (small prints) or Priority Mail (larger prints or packages with multiple prints) and will include tracking.\nThe items shipped to our international friends usually take 3 weeks for delivery to your local post office, but can sometimes take up to 3-6 weeks depending on the country. Note that customs for your local country may hold on to packages for a  week or longer and incur  additional charges that is the responsibility of the backer. We will not  mark items as a \"gift.\" We know that shipping overseas is  very expensive and we wish it was cheaper, too! We help by subsidizing  some of the shipping cost. We make no money from the shipping charges collected.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhy you should trust Flesk Publications? John Fleskes answers:\n\nI pride myself on having an 18 year record of publishing nearly 100 art books. I've run over a dozen previous Kickstarter campaigns with artists such as Brom, Frank Cho, J.A.W. Cooper, Jeffrey Alan Love, Gary Gianni and Mike Mignola (Hellboy: Into the Silent Sea Studio Edition), Petar Meseldzija, Richard and Wendy Pini (Elfquest), Mark Schultz, and Daren Bader and Lance HaunRogue. Most of these have been on time. We are very open with our backers and communicate through updates often to keep you up to date.\n\nIn some cases, things don't always go exactly as planned in the publishing world. Much of the time they do, but sometimes an unexpected problem or delay arises. In the rare case that this happens, simply put, I deal with it and find a way to get the job done. I am very open about any challenges and like to share in the process so people know what's going on. I don't like surprises, and don't feel anyone else should either. I respect the artist, and our supporters too much to let them down. The good thing is that I've published nearly 100 books and I know how to get them shipped and delivered, and I know how to manage a schedule and keep projects on track, and I will stay motivated and energized to get the books into your hands when I said I would.\n\nThanks to everyone has supported us.

There were three issues originally published, but the book was soon overshadowed by a larger market presence by Archie and a flood of titles by comics publishers like EC. The title was unceremoniously cancelled and quietly slipped into public domain.\nOver the years, reprint books have showcased these classic stories, but this is the first time ever that an entire book of all-new adventures will be published!\nThe idea for a collection of new Jetta adventures had been kicking around for a few years by Rich Maurizio.  We talked years ago and last year he approached me again to say Jeff Shultz and Ken Wheaton were also up for it.  We talked and here we are.  We immediately went to work recruiting some really special friends and talent to make the original vision a reality!\n\"Fishing Cover\" by Jeff Shultz and Jimmy \"T\" Tournas\nHere are just a few samples of stories from the book...\nPage from \"COOKIES\" story by Craig Boldman/ Jeff Shultz and Tim Estilez\nPage from \"Star Truckers\" story by Chris Yambar / Pat & Tim Kenndey / Jim Tournas\n\"Shake your Bot-ty\" story by Angelo DeCesare / Bill Walko\n\"The Binge\" a Simpson's parody by Craig Boldman / Jeff Shultz / Ken Wheaton.\nMy first Kickstarter was a handsome hardcover book in 2014 for Joe Sinnott, collecting his Pope John XXIII stories from Treasure Chest comics, which Joe personally considered his best and most personal work.\n\n      My Credits are Inking Spider-man Sundays, Archie and Friends, Inking & Producing Shylock, Monster Squad and Full Moon Craze six book Mini-series.\nRich has worked on books and comics for many popular characters over the years, like Animaniacs, Looney Tunes, and The Munsters.\nJeff has drawn many characters, but mainly hundreds and hundreds of pages for Archie Comics over the last few decades.\nKen has worked on art for several Simpsons books and comics, as well as drawing issues of Popeye.\nJoining these guys is an all-star team\u2026 writers Chris Yambar, Matt Manning, Angelo DeCesare, Craig Boldman, and Paul Kupperburg, along with artists Joe Sinnott, Al Milgrom, Pat & Tim Kennedy, Bill Walko, George Broderick, and Tim Estiloz.\nJoe Sinnott penciled and inked one of our covers, As well as inking Jeff Shultz on a cover,  sadly these will be his last original published work.  With his passing, Joe didn\u2019t get to pencil a story for the book, so Al Milgrom graciously stepped in to draw a story that would have made Joe proud!\nJoltin' Joe Sinnott putting final finishes off Jetta cover\nRounding out our team, we\u2019ve got hand lettering by the talented Eddy Chapman, digital lettering by Mattia Gentili, colors by Michael Woods, and some inked images by Mark Sinnott, in a book with his father-what a wonderful tribute!\nMark Sinnott inking Jetta Raye Strips\nRich Maurizio, Jimmy T (Me) and Joe SInnott 2019 at Saugerties, NY\nArchie Artist Jeff Shultz\nArchie and Jetta artists Pat and Tim Kennedy\nWriter/Artist Cris Yambar and Artist George Broderick\nArtist/Inker Bill Walko\nJoe Jusko, Ken Wheaton and Joe Sinnott\nTeam assembled and working hard to bring you the best in entertainment.\nPat and Tim Kennedy pencils, Jimmy T inks.\nAs a reward we have a Joe Sinnott inked cover over Jeff Shultz. \n\"Dance Cover\" by Jeff SHultz and Joe Sinnott\nWe also have as a reward Joe Sinnott's last comic art cover he penciled and Inked.

FOR ALL BACKERS WITH PHYSICALLY SHIPPING REWARDS!\nAfter that comes our NEXT STRETCH GOAL REWARD - THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN #300 HOMAGE SHI: WOTW #1 25TH ANNIVERSARY PURE LINE VARIANT COVER! \nSHI\u2019S BACK! Exclusive cover by Billy Tucci\nBLACK FRIDAY SPECIAL - REMARKED NOIR PRINT!\nKickstarter Exclusive Cover - SHI: Return of the Warrior!!!!!!!\nThere I was\u2026 \nArmed with a portfolio holding the very pages in this book and storming the floor of the 1993 Comic Con International in San Diego\u2026\nI was anxious.  I knew no one, but even though my heart was pounding through my chest at this \u201cone shot\u201d at comic book fame, I held a strong conviction that I could somehow scratch out a living in this fantastically creative industry.  Like many a budding cartoonist at this biggest of all conventions, I stood in long lines and when it was my turn to show my wares, opened my book hoping the bored and hung-over editor would awake from his stupor and look up at me wide-eyed like he\u2019d just made a great discovery\u2026  And offer me a job. \nSTRETCH GOALS!!!\n  (Please note: Stretch goals are distributed per backer)\nProblem was, that aside from Lady Death creator, Brian Pulido (who graciously offered me a pin up), no one was interested.  From the \u201cBig Two\u201d all the way down to the smallest of publishers, all turned me down -- every single one of them.  To say I was heartbroken would be a callous understatement, but I was undeterred.  I remember thinking to myself, on that long flight back home to New York, about a life of illustrating licensing products, or even going back to designing children\u2019s wear.  Perhaps I could go back to the National Guard.   Either way, I had to do something as I was incredibly broke and way behind in my rent.\nI put on my Sony \u201cdiscman\u201d (remember those?) and removed the portfolio from the aircraft\u2019s overheadstorage bin.  Listening to Kitaro\u2019s Kojiki, (which was the soundtrack I crafted up the \u201cWay of the Warrior\u201d story arc) I began thumbing through the book, critiquing each and every panel and determining which pages were good and which had to be redone.  My mindset was one of defiance as my train of thought was  \u201cI\u2019m not going to forget these pages and come back in six months with new material\u201d like I had been instructed by the editors.  I will keep them, improve upon them and move forward with \u201cmy story\u201d\u2026 the story of Ana Ishikawa and her monogatari titled, \u201cShi.\u201d  I was going to self-publish comic books.\nBilly Tucci - Creator\nAnd that, pretty much, is how it all started.  Of course the next six months were utterly painful, but so exciting, as I delved into researching - just how in the hell does one \u201cself-publish?\u201d  This was before the internet, so I hit every library, read every book and bothered every retailer who would speak to me, trying to figure out just how to do this.  All the while, I worked freelance design by day and sharpened the Shi pages by night.   I \u201cemployed\u201d two great friends, co-writer Peter Gutierrez and designer Barry Orkin, with my ever-suffering wife (then ever-suffering girlfriend), Deborah to refine the script and define the artwork.  There was much aggravation, missteps, late hours and fear \u2013 at one point I almost sold half the creation to a pair of predatory business \u201cpartners\u201d, but that\u2019s a story for a different day.  There were also triumphs -- none so gratifying as March 23, 1994 \u2013 the day, \u201cShi \u2013 The Way of the Warrior #1\u201d shipped to comic shops across North America and Europe, making the anxious drama that seemed to daunt its creation every step of the way all well worth it.\nAs they say, from that day forward, things have never been the same.  And it\u2019s all because of my friends, family, retailers and most of all, you \u2013 the reader.  Especially those of you who, for some reason or another, chose my book among hundreds that day in 1994, and for that I am forever grateful.  \nSHI: Way of the Warrior #1, 1994\nSo join us for the first new Shi graphic novel in 15 years  ...  A story in which a comic book character has grown up in real time. ..  A story that is literally 25 years in the making and one we hope you will love reading as much as we have loved making.\nThank you\u2026 #SHISBACK!\nBilly Tucci\n\nSHI\u2019S BACK!!!!\nSHI \u201cAmazing Spider-Man #301\u201d Homage Cover by Billy Tucci\nCrusade Comics is so excited to bring you the debut crowdfunding campaign for our all new 48-page graphic novel Shi: Return of the Warrior! \nNigen-Sei Cover by Billy Tucci\nIn this story over a quarter century in the making we now find our heroine Ana Ishikawa 15 years removed from when she last graced the pages of a comic book. Ana is divorced from her husband, disgraced NYPD detective Peter DeNyse and now lives a peaceful, quiet existence raising their teenage daughter Hotaru.\nTeenager Hotaru Ishikawa and her mother, Ana\nSHI: Return of the Warrior, Interior\nMost importantly, her warrior days far behind her\u2026\nBut that all changes when Dr. YOU (a character that will be named after one of our backers via a special pledge level) brings the terrifying news that Masahiro Arashi has escaped from a New York City Mental Institution. Her former antagonist, now suffering from dementia has regressed back to his younger more violent self and is vengefully obsessed with the one person responsible for his incarcerated existence\u2026 Ana Ishikawa!\nSHI: Return of the Warrior, Interior page\nManhattan is once again gripped in fear as a series of gruesome copycat Shi Killings resurface \u2013 with the order of victims proving ever closer to Ana. A desperate Ana must now, alongside Dr. You, seek out and stop Arashi before he can fulfill his murderous destiny\u2026 a destiny whose road ends with her own daughter Hotaru.\nThe maddened Masahiro Arashi\nAs Doctor You and Ana get ever closer, he confesses to her of Arashi\u2019s twisted and dangerous obsession with the young Ana\u2019s secret warrior persona, SHI, the living embodiment of death.\nWorse still, the maddened Arashi is convinced that everyone: nurses, orderlies, janitors and especially the man treating him is in love with the lithe mistress of the underworld (Yomi). \nDr. \"You\" (to be named by one of our backers!)\nAna is mortified that the doctor is fully aware that she is indeed a murderess and knows that if ever exposed would rightly be the end of her world. But You assures her secret is safe and even though his own life is in danger, he promises to take it (due to both professional and personal reasons) \u201cto the grave.\u201d\nSHI: Return of the Warrior, Interior\nBut the grave just might be waiting for them all. For Ana will realize that measured acumen only goes so far in protecting those you love and, once again, the lioness within Ana will resurface to take up her trusted naginata, transform the hunted into the hunter, and unsheathe\u2026 The Return of the Warrior.\nSHI: Return of the Warrior, Interior\nIn Return of the Warrior, Shi creator Billy Tucci is joined by co-writer Steven Peros, co-artist Ricardo Silva, colorist HI-FI Colour Design, designer Mindy Lopkin and superstar cover artists Amanda Conner, Paul Mounts, Wes Hartman, Conny Valentina and Mike Renzine. \nOur Troops\nSpecial Guest Cover Artists!\nCover by Amanda Conner\nAnd as a very special bonus the legendary George Perez (colored by Wes Hartman) has gracefully come out of retirement to provide one last and unforgettably beautiful Shi cover. \nCover by George Perez\nPure Line Art Editions\nConny Valentina Cover Art\nGeorge Perez Original Cover Artwork for Shi: Return of the Warrior\nBilly Tucci's ORIGINAL AMAZING SPIDER-MAN #301 HOMAGE COVER ARTWORK!\nWith tons of fun reward levels for you to become the hero!!!!!\nChallenge Coins!\nSHI-Shirt\nCover by Mike Renzine", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are so grateful to the OUTSTANDING fans Shi has had these last 25 years and are so very appreciative of how patiently you all waited for the next chapter in the saga.

We just have to be able to pay for the privilege.\nYou worked hard getting the word out about IMPOSSIBLE JONES\u2014 and succeeded by sharing, posting, and re-tweeting images like this:\nThanks to several successful re-tweet campaigns every Backer will get IMPOSSIBLE JONES DIGITAL WALLPAPERS and this special KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE IMPOSSIBLE JONES STICKER (PDF for Digital Backers; delivered upon successful completion of the campaign, of course):\nNOT TO MENTION (Since we are funded, after all):\nWe now return to the IMPOSSIBLE JONES: GRIN & GRITTY Kickstarter, already in progress\u2026\nA thief gets powers, is mistaken for a superhero\u2014 and runs with it. Why not? Comes with some great perks. Of course, she has no intention of reforming\u2014 with these powers? Are you kidding?!\u2014 it's just sometimes there's no better place to hide than in plain sight.\nIMPOSSIBLE, you say?\nEXACTLY!\nImagine Harley Quinn meets Plastic Man in the Marvel Universe with a little Dick Tracy thrown in. Kind of. \nThat's IMPOSSIBLE JONES! \nIMP in her native habitat.\nI first thought of IMPOSSIBLE JONES as a monthly comic\u2014 but the first \"issue\" became 27 epic pages, so now it's a 132-page (or more!) Graphic Novel collecting what would have been the first 5 \"issues\" of her comic\u2014 the irrepressible Imp's entire Origin Story!\nAnd IMPOSSIBLE JONES: GRIN & GRITTY isn't just any graphic novel, but an Ultra-Cool Collector's Edition Graphic Novel! \nWorking design only. But still\u2014 pretty cool!\nHARDCOVER!\n OVERSIZED! (7.5x11 inches!)\n 110 PAGES OF STORY! (if not more!)\nIntroduction by the impossibly generous and talented GAIL SIMONE! \n PIN-UPS by AMANDA CONNER! HOWARD CHAYKIN! TOM GRUMMETT! PETE WOODS! And others!\n BEHIND-THE-SCENES sketches and stories!\nPLUS (if the Stretch Goal Gods smile on us):\n SPOT GLOSS on the cover!\nFULL-COLOR ENDSHEETS!\nSWANKY RIBBON BOOKMARK!\nOf course, IMPOSSIBLE JONES is a new character. You know nothing about her. Let's fix that\u2026\nA SHORT TIME LATER\u2026\nWant to see the MISSING PAGES from this mini-adventure? Support this project and you get the whole story in UPDATE #1\u2014 for Backers only!\nThe amusing-if-somewhat-morally-ambiguous adventures of IMPOSSIBLE JONES are brought to you by:\nKarl loves his job far more than he has any right to. He has written, inked, and occasionally penciled: Superman, Superboy, Harley Quinn, Spider-man, Suicide Squad, Fantastic Four, Captain America and many others\u2014 although he has an inexplicable fondness for obscure characters no one else remembers. His current obsessions are his creator-owned comics with Tom Grummett\u2014 SECTION ZERO\u2014 and David Hahn\u2014 IMPOSSIBLE JONES (you may have heard of her)! Waiting in the wings: SAINT MAYHEM! Karl lives in Portland, Oregon with his wonderful wife Myrna, their energetic son Isaac, and cute-as-a-bug daughter Eliza. He really can\u2019t complain about much.\nDavid's work is decidedly contemporary and reflects his eye for crisp detail. He has illustrated Marvel's Spider-man Loves Mary Jane, and Marvel Adventures: The Fantastic Four, DC's Batman \u201966 Meets Wonder Woman \u201977, and Vertigo's Bite Club, Fables, and Lucifer, as well as The Batman Handbook. David was nominated for both an Eisner Award and an Ignatz Award for his creator-owned comic series Private Beach, published by Slave Labor Graphics. An avid \u2026 who loves video games, David has somehow found himself living in bear and cougar country in the backwoods of western Montana.\nAIDING AND ABETTING THESE TWO: \nTony Avina\u2014 an American comic book colorist. Born and raised in the South Bay area of Los Angeles, he began his career working for Wildstorm Production in 2001. Since then he\u2019s worked for DC Comics, Marvel, Image, Dark Horse and Dynamite Entertainment. Some of his notable projects are The Boys, Happy, Sleeper, Richard Dragon, Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay and Batman \u201866 Meets the Green Hornet.\nALSO: The crafty COMICRAFT gang on letters.  \nNo, the book is not done.\nThe first chapter/issue is totally complete. The second chapter/issue only has letters, colors and some inks left to finish. There are still three more chapters/issues to produce.\nWith your support, David and I are confident we can finish that over the next handful of months.\nBut to make the wait a little easier, we do have some lovely Reward Levels to offer you\u2026\nYOU GIVE. WE GIVE BACK. ONLY FAIR.\nI will hand-deliver these to any shop within *REASONABLE* driving distance of Portland, Oregon. So for those lucky ducks: NO POSTAGE!\nNOTE: Both books will be shipped together, once IMPOSSIBLE JONES: GRIN & GRITTY has been printed.\nNOTE: All three books will be shipped together, once IMPOSSIBLE JONES: GRIN & GRITTY and SECTION ZERO 1959 have been printed.\n\nYOU IN THE SPOTLIGHT!\nAWESOME ART OPPORTUNITIES!\n\nHere's where things get fun(ner). Stretch Goals will alternate between something that makes the book better\u2014 spot gloss on cover, full color endsheets, etc.\u2014 and something for everyone who has pledged at THE GOODS\u2014 BUT BETTER! level or above\u2014 trading cards, stickers, cloisonne pins, etc.\nSo the more money raised, the more cool stuff you get\u2014 at no extra cost to you! (As long as you've pledged at THE GOODS\u2014 BUT BETTER! level or above.)\nIt is impossible to show how much coolness spot gloss adds to a book's cover. For an Ultra-Cool Collector's Edition, it's a gotta-have.\nGiven Imp's uncanny ability to alter her appearance, Paper Dolls are a natural! Not only will she have different outfits (since she can shape-shift her uniform, too) but different arms, extra arms, etc. A quick and easy way to explain Imp's powers to people you meet at cocktail parties.\n$50,000 STRETCH GOAL instantly added to everyone pledging at or above THE GOODS\u2013 BUT BETTER! level.\n$51,000 STRETCH GOAL instantly added to everyone pledging at or above THE GOODS\u2013 BUT BETTER! level.\n$52,000 STRETCH GOAL instantly added to everyone pledging at or above THE GOODS\u2013 BUT BETTER! level.\nNOTE: Until actually unlocked, all Stretch Goals may be changed or modified as new, cooler ideas come to me!\nIf you followed my SECTION ZERO campaigns, you know I vowed to get a tattoo to commemorate every successful Kickstarter I run. I stand by that vow! I now have two SECTION ZERO tatts, and would love\u2014 LOVE!\u2014 to add one for IMPOSSIBLE JONES.\nOnly YOU can make that possible. Only YOU can get me to decorate (or desecrate, depending on your view) my body\u2014 by getting IMPOSSIBLE JONES funded! Whatever ends up on my arm (or leg) is in your hands! (So to speak.)\nFirst: DON'T PANIC!\nApproximate postage costs will be:\nUNITED STATES: $8\nCANADA: $15\nTHE REST OF THE WORLD: $25\nFingers crossed, those numbers won't change much.\nPostage will be charged after the campaign ends, when the survey goes out and we know exactly how much it will cost.\nThis way we don't end up with an under-estimated postal bill that cripples us, and you don't end up with an over-inflated postage charge based on assumptions and guesses.\nOur surveys will be handled by BACKERKIT, who has done this many, many times before. The process is simple, safe, and painless. You will be glad we're doing it this way. Trust us.\nTruly and sincerely, I am constantly amazed and humbled by the power of people like you to make, well, the impossible possible. Making comics\u2014 and specifically making creator-owned comics like IMPOSSIBLE JONES\u2014 is what I want to do most in the world, but I can't do it without you. It doesn't even exist without you, without your support and belief.

Written by Robbie MacK, illustrated by Dario Carrasco and colored by Natalia Nesteranko. The zombies in Crude Awakening were inspired by the horror feature film, Peelers, with permission from the Director, Sev\u00e9 Schelenz.\nThe first issue also includes these awesome variant covers by Italian artist, Leo Colapietro.\nCustom commissions from Leo of any mainstream character are also available for only $295! Check the Commission Crude pledge package for details. Here are some examples of his previous work.\nBryn Walker, is the unlucky police officer that first discovers one of the Shaman's victims. She is called to investigate a burned-out house, inhabited by a homeless teenage boy and his infected girlfriend.\nAfter narrowly escaping a violent altercation with the zombified teenage girl, Bryn rushes back to her department headquarters to find it has been over-run by zombies. She joins the few remaining survivors, including her partner John Redcrow, as they mount a last-ditch defense of the town against the crazed horde of zombies.  John has a hunch that this outbreak might be more than a freak of nature... it could be a reckoning!\nYou'll never look at oil the same way again!\nClick HERE to view a 7-page PDF preview of issue 1.  \nWhile Crude Awakening can be enjoyed as a fun, gore-filled zombie apocalypse, it also tackles some troublesome themes faced by contemporary Canadian society. Such themes include the country's angst towards the production of crude oil and the plight of the First Nations people.\nNow that you've read about the story, take a look at these awesome rewards!  We've tried to put together a full spectrum of pledge packages that should cater to everyone's tastes and budgets. In addition to the great sequential page art by Dario and Natalia, I'm really excited to offer the four alternative cover designs by Italian artistic prodigy, Leo Colapietro. These masterpieces are available as pinups in the Digital edition PDF, as pinups or posters in the print packages and as t-shirts too! At this point, we only have plans to do a print run using one of them as a variant cover, but if we hit our stretch goals, we could end up offering them ALL as variant covers!  \nCheck out the animated GIF below that showcases Leo's ingenious creative process.\n\nHere are the pledge package descriptions.

He has been making his personal ballpoint pen drawings purely for himself for over two decades. This is the first time that these rarely seen works have been captured into a dedicated volume. Compiled here are his favorites, many which are done recently specially for this book. Many pieces are shown in four stages that are accompanied by Frank's commentary to reveal his process. He is completely self-taught which makes for a unique and educational experience.\nIncluded within the book are visual guides for anatomy and body parts, plus a short interview where Frank discusses his working methods and answers the most common questions that he receives online. Also shown are comic covers for his creator owned property Skybourne, where he has incorporated ballpoint pen in a mixed media format to show you how to incorporate the ballpoint pen into commercial assignments.\nPremium Signed Gicl\u00e9e Prints\nOnly available to our Kickstarter supporters during this campaign! These four signed luxurious 13 x 19\" museum quality gicl\u00e9e prints feature Frank Cho's favorite and most popular works.

Note that customs for your local country may  hold on to packages for a week or longer and incur additional charges that is the responsibility of the backer.

John Fleskes answers:\n\nI pride myself on having a sixteen year record of delivering over eighty books of the highest quality. I've run ten previous Kickstarter campaigns with artists such as Brom, Frank Cho, J.A.W. Cooper, Jeffrey Alan Love, Gary Gianni and Mike Mignola (Hellboy: Into the Silent Sea Studio Edition), Petar Meseldzija, Richard and Wendy Pini (Elfquest), Mark Schultz, and Daren Bader and Lance HaunRogue. Most of these have been on time. We are very open with our backers and communicate through updates often to keep you up to date.\n\nIn some cases, things don't always go exactly as planned in the publishing world. Much of the time they do, but sometimes an unexpected problem or delay arises. In the rare case that this happens, simply put, I deal with it and find a way to get the job done. I am very open about any challenges and like to share in the process so people know what's going on. I don't like surprises, and don't feel anyone else should either. I respect the artist, and our supporters too much to let them down. The good thing is that I've published over eighty books and I know how to get them shipped and delivered, and I know how to manage a schedule and keep projects on track, and I will stay motivated and energized to get the books into your hands when I said I would.\n\nI can't thank everyone enough who has supported us before.

Thanks to the generosity of friends, family, colleagues and even strangers here on Kickstarter, the comic was drawn, printed and found its way into the hands of over 100 backers.

We strive to always better each project with every step forward, in the hopes to someday produce stories that can be pointed to as someone's favorite. Over the past several years, we have made a modist controbution to the industry while cautiously getting our feet wet. This year however, we would like to make a big splash as we team up with a new artist (Jason Seaux) and prepare to relaunch issue #1 of our flagship character, a zombie super hero named Necro-Man. This time around we have dilagnetly reworked the script and story structure to optimize our concept's full potential. The art for this book, that you will be able to preview in our video, promises to knock your socks off...Jason pulls no punches! As Halloween quickly approaches, the last few blocks of this puzzle are being put into place. With your help here on kickstarter, by making donations Necro-Man will be able to meet his DEADline and hopefully rise from the grave! All profit made from this campaign will be put towards printing costs and other minor expenses that will insure a much wider spread success in reaching more fans of our unique brand of story telling. We have gathered varius resources to put together some fun and exciting prizes to thank those of you who chose to support our dream. In advance, all fo us at Paranoia Comics would like to take the time to say thank you.

We are not on the level of the two big companies that dominate the industry... nor are we even anywhere near the lower level companies that sit just below them. But what we do have, is hard working creative people that are passionate and dedicated to entertaining fans and giving them their moneys worth. Some of the most common expenses are of course paying artists, writers, and printing costs. Often, a casual fan may not be aware of other costs such as buying tables to sell at conventions, gas it takes to get to those conventions, and various other avenues required for promotion. Obviously we do not desire to become rich from this kickstarter campaign, but we would be forever grateful to any of those willing to support us and our childhood dream of making action packed comic books for everyone to enjoy!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Shout out", "descp": "A shout out on the Necro-Man Facebook page and our gratitude.\nINCLUDES:\nA shout out on the Necro-man Facebook Page.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2018"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 3 or more", "title": "Digital pdf download of issue #1", "descp": "A digital download of Necro-Man issue #1\nINCLUDES:\nDigital pdf download of issue #1\nA shout out on the Necro-man Facebook Page.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2018"}], "stat": ["6 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "printed copy of Necro-Man #1", "descp": "This is an actual copy of the book.\nGet a physical copy of Necro-Man #1 +pdf digital download of issue #1\nINCLUDES:\nDigital pdf download of issue #1\nA shout out on the Necro-man Facebook Page.\nprinted copy of Necro-Man #1", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["10 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "O.G Necro reward", "descp": "You'll get issue(s) (2) of the original Necro-Man Series and one signed Reboot Necro-Man #1 by Mark Scholl and Jason Seaux. 1 print by Nikkol Jelenic and Mark McKenna. 1 print by Valerie Sattazahn.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital pdf download of issue #1\nA shout out on the Necro-man Facebook Page.\nprinted copy of Necro-Man #1\nOriginal Necro-Man #1\n1 print by Nikkol Jelenic and Mark McKenna\n1 print by Valerie Sattazahn", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["20 backers", "Limited (30 left of 50)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Jason Seaux original sketch cover.", "descp": "You get a hand drawn sketch cover by Necro-Man Artist Jason Seaux.

The 112-page hardcover spans Starlin's entire career, including classic images, rare private commissions, personal work, never-before-published sequential pages, and even the world's first glimpse of a new Dreadstar story.\n\nThis is pure Starlin, in all its cosmic power and glory. The images contained in the Black Book are all hand-picked by Jim Starlin, who has written commentary throughout. The cover is brand new, and may well be the last image Starlin draws after an accident injured his drawing hand. \nThe second project is an oversize hardcover edition of Jim Starlin's illustrated prose novella Mindgames, a science-fiction epic set on Hardcore Station.\nIn Mindgames, telepath Dr. Zareb Alter is in reality a former member of a notorious interstellar crime organization. Alter is pulled back into his dirty family business as he tries to solve a murder on Hardcore Station. Along the way, he must contend with a genetically-altered collection of power-enhanced psychopaths, as well as deviants of all kinds, if he intends to reach the heart of the mystery.\nStarlin's expansive, lavish artwork for Mindgames will be reproduced in gray tones, as the acclaimed illustrator originally intended. The result is a graphic and narrative tour de force from a master storyteller.\nDescribed by the creator himself as \"Starlin-brand sci-fi and weirdness\" and checking in at more than 100 pages, this is the only hardcover publication of this story. Mindgames is the beginning of a four-part Hardcore Station story cycle.\n\nJIM STARLIN ART PORTFOLIO\nLimited to only 250 copies, the Jim Starlin Art Portfolio can be had for a pledge of $95 or more. The portfolio contains five of Jim Starlin's most exquisite illustrations, printed on thick paper stock at 9 inches by 12 inches.

An accident last year injured Jim's drawing hand, leading him to devote himself to writing full time. So in order to make original art a part of this campaign, we have enlisted a slate of Jim's collaborators and admirers to execute pieces featuring Jim's creations and most well-known characters. We'll be offering one original per day as a reward tier, from creators like Phil Hester, Tom Raney, Rick Leonardi, Graham Nolan, Andy Smith, Darryl Banks, Paul Harding, and many more.\n\nThe rewards also include hardcover copies of Black Book: The Art of Jim Starlin and the illustrated novella Mindgames.

These heroes overpowered, surprised, and weakened the hundreds of thousands of German forces in the area so the troops landing on the beaches the following morning could take a foothold in the coast. The British 6th Airborne would land at Pegasus Bridge, the first place to be liberated in France, whereas the 101st Airborne and the 82nd Airborne would land in areas such as Saint Mere Eglise and Saint Come du Mont. But their victory came at a terrible prices as thousands were killed or missing, many caught in trees with their boots dangling mere feet from the land they traveled  so far to liberate. Loaded down with almost 200 pounds of equipment and jumping into a flak and machine-gun filled sky is a mohawked, war-painted member of Jake McNiece's Demolition Platoon 3/506th PIR aka. \"The Filthy Thirteen.\" This image honors those true heroes who were the inspiration of the book and film, \"The Dirty Dozen.\"  Remember these brave sky soldiers and those heroes who hold up that honorable legacy to this day, for they are the rough ones who stand ready so we may sleep peacefully in our beds at night.\nAnd such were my thoughts when I illustrated \u201cNight of Nights.\u201d \nIn my 20 plus years in the comic book business, this is one of my very favorite pieces.

Did I mention that this is one wacky fun story?\nThe story is told in a sequential art format for those who love comic books but the product will be published as a hardcover children's book to give it a solid durable feel that both kids and adults enjoy. This will also make it easier for libraries to order copies and get them into the hands of kids in schools across the country.\nPunk Taco was created, written and designed by myself and my 5 year old son. I am inking, coloring, lettering and designing the book as well with pencil assists by the super talented Gabriel Mayorga.\nWe are currently in the process of inking and coloring the book and will be  finished with the art in March.\nI am looking to raise $4,000.00  to cover the cost of production (Inking, coloring, lettering, editing and design) printing, and shipping. Any extra money will be put into adding more pages of story/art and making the book even more awesome.\nI am not offering a lot of rewards outside of autographed copies, sketches and original art because I want to focus all my time on finishing the book. \nI don't want to give too much away but here are a few  pages of pencil art before they are colored and lettered. I'm going to update this page as much as possible to show you what we are working on.

Magic Shop or Dwarven Tavern? In Unreal Estate, the City Council has hired you to build the best cityscape, which you'll do by drafting buildings to your hand. Rejected designs go to the Scrap Pile, but as demand for those buildings grows, you can reclaim them to score the most points. But be careful that the other architects don't score them before you!\nDesigned by Jason Slingerland (cohost of Building the Game podcast and designer of Water Balloon Washout), with art by the talented Corinne Roberts, Unreal Estate is a game of drafting, hand management, and timing set in a fictional fantasy city. It is a game for 2-4 players, and only takes about 20 minutes to play.\nDuring Unreal Estate's development, playtesters consistently commented that they enjoyed the simple mechanics combined with real decisions on every turn. Players never felt as though they were playing on autopilot, and a turn was always made with consideration of other players' actions \u2013 all in a 20-minute game. Check out the amazing art and the print-and-play files to see how Unreal Estate pulls it off.\n                PLAY\n\nIf you want to check out the rules for Unreal Estate, or print out the game and try it for yourself, download the print-and-play files right here! \nAchieving our base funding goal will ensure that Grand Gamers Guild will be able to publish Unreal Estate with high quality that you expect.\nHere is a list of all unlocked stretch goals that will allow us to upgrade components and help us add more cards, better bits, and even prettier components!\n  Unreal Estate is a hit! Find out what many board game reviewers, insiders, and designers are saying about the game.\n                                         Have you played Unreal Estate and want to tell everyone how much you enjoyed it? Join the discussion here on Kickstarter and please share on BoardGameGeek!\nUnreal Estate is available for world-wide shipping and all copies will ship from within the US. Shipping fees will be added to your pledge level when you select your location. Shipping costs to specific locations are shown on each pledge level.\nWe know that international shipping can be a pain, so check out our 5 copy pledge level to save on shipping for groups!\nNote: International Backers will be responsible for any import fees, brokerage or delivery surcharges, or applicable taxes that may be levied after we have shipped your package. However, this campaign is customs friendly for the $25 level and below. The low price point for this game should not cause any customs fees for backers pledging for 1 copy. We all know that shipping can be costly, so we are doing our absolute best to keep shipping costs low and fair. We appreciate your understanding and support!\n \nMarc Specter is the Master of the Grand Gamers Guild. He is also an owner of GrandCon Gaming Convention and Headmaster of the Grand Gaming Academy demo team.\nJason Slingerland is cohost of the Building the Game podcast and self-published Water Balloon Washout.\nCorinne Roberts realized our building ideas in traditional watercolor art. All prints of her work for sale can be found here.\nChris Kirkman is the Graphic Designer for Unreal Estate. He is also the founder of Dice Hate Me Games, voice of the State of Games Podcast, and co-designer of the upcoming Fate of the Elder Gods.\nThe project video was created by Jason Slingerland and Rob Couch. The How-to-Play narration was provided by Jason Slingerland. Music by Kevin MacLeod.\nKickstarter is an interesting landscape, very different from 2010 when Alien Frontiers broke the scene open for the board gaming world. For many it has turned into a pre-order system, and the notion of being a patron \u2013 of supporting a creator and helping see his/her vision to fruition \u2013 often no longer seems to be the central focus for many. \nThis is my first project, and some may question, \"Can he really make this happen with only a $5,000 goal?\" I chose that goal because I believe I should put at least as much into this project as you, my supporters, do. It will take more than $5,000 to see this dream come true, but my part is ready. If you are willing to embrace the Guild by lending us your support, we really do appreciate it. Thank you for looking at our project, and considering bringing to life our collective vision.\nSincerely,\nMarc Specter\n  If you want to be kept updated and have a chance to win a copy of Unreal Estate, visit grandgamersguild.com and sign up for our mailing list.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project that involves the production and manufacture of a good to be delivered, there is certainly a real chance for hiccups and delays. Many boardgame projects on Kickstarter have been seriously hampered by art production delays, problems with an overseas factory, missing units and one shipping snafu after another.\n\nEven though this is Grand Gamers Guild's first project, our team has a wealth of experience in the production process.\n\nWe won't lie - stuff happens. Delays can occur. Sometimes you have to go back and forth on color samples six times just to get the color right, and even then the color isn't perfect.

This Kickstarter project is so I can print my \"Art of Tom Bancroft, Vol. 1\" book and ship it to you.  \nThe Book\nSpecs are: 8.5\"x 12\", 52 pages, hardcover, with glossy, full color pages.\nThis is a simple project, but one I've been wanting to do for some time now.  It will feature mostly full page art illustrations by me and colored by industry professionals Jeremiah Skipper (most of them), but also by Joe Spadaford, me, Chuck Vollmer and Jesse Heagy. With some sketches sprinkled in there also.  Most of the content are fan drawings, commissions, or \"for fun\" drawings I've done over the last couple years.  A few might by favorites of mine from a little farther back than that.  I want this to feel like the \"ultimate\" Tom Bancroft art book.  If you've enjoyed my artwork on Instagram (tombancroft1), DeviantArt, or other places over the years, I think you'll like this book.\nMy background is character design and traditional animation- mostly with Disney Feature Animation.  I worked on many of the classic Disney films of the 90s (Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, Aladdin, Tarzan, Mulan, and Brother Bear to name a few) but also worked on Veggietales, ABCMouse.com, and other properties for Marvel, DC, Archie comics and more.  In my 30 year career I've also illustrated many children's books, created comic books and worked on video games too.  You've seen little pieces of me all over the place and probably didn't know it.  Additionally, I've written two perennial art instruction books: \"Creating Characters with Personality\" and \"Character Mentor\" that are the #1 best selling books on the subject of Character Design and are used as text books at art schools around the world.  Much of those artistic influences will be in this book in some way. \nMy goal is to keep this Kickstarter simple: It's about creating this book.  The artwork for the book is finished, the graphic design/page layout is already in process and the printer in China is Global PSD, whom I've worked with before on my Opposite Forces\" graphic novel.  They do excellent work.  I do have some REWARD tiers for artwork that is either already in the book or might be if we reach a later Milestone goal, so that artwork is already completed, so you should have nothing to fear concerning this project not getting finished or being delayed.  \nWHERE WILL THE MONEY GO?  That's easy- about 70-75% goes to paying to get the books printed.  Another 15% goes to shipping supplies for the books (along with additional shipping costs in the Reward tiers themselves).  Lastly, about 8-10% is allocated for Kickstarter fees and about 3% for my graphic designer.  There is NOTHING in this for me besides a few left over books (I hope!) that I can sell at a later date.  IF we go beyond the asking amount, I hope to get some of my work/expenses/time paid for, but I do not expect it.  (My wife would like that though.)  I also hope to put some more of that back into the books by adding Milestone Goals (more pages!) as we go.  \nLet's do this!  \nThank you for considering backing and supporting this Kickstarter!  I need you to help me make this book project a reality.  -Tom Bancroft\nJust some of the artwork that will be INSIDE the book\nJUST ADDED (May 6) :  BY POPULAR REQUEST-  ADD- ONS!\n  EDIT: STRETCH GOALS BEING ADDED!

Aliens are an everyday part of life, and humanity has found its place among them.\n\nWednesday Daring is a bounty hunter. She's young, she's fearless and she's damn good at what she does for a living -- although not always the most motivated. Our protagonist is a firm believer in the idea that the rigors of life should not stand in the way of a good time.\n\nShe is smart. She is sarcastic. She is beautiful. She is bold. Quite frankly, she's an absolute joy to write.\n\nThe comic we are asking you to Kickstart is a 24-page second issue that is the latter half of a two-part story arc. We are asking for enough money to cover the pencils, inks, colors, letters, printing and shipping of the book, as well as the creation and shipping of the rewards we have offered. Currently, we have all of the pages penciled and half inked. The first five pages, which you can see below, have been colored and lettered. \n\nSince everything is already penciled, and the inks will be done before the end of this Kickstarter campaign, we anticipate a quick turnaround and shipment of comics beginning this summer. We've stated August if only for the fact that we've hit some snags on the past couple of projects that delayed the shipping, but we are hoping to be done sooner than that. \nTHE COMIC\nHere are the two available covers: \nDead by Wednesday #2 cover\nDead by Wednesday #2 variant cover\n And here are the first five pages to showcase the interior artwork:\nPage 1\nPage 2\nPage 3\nPage 4\nPage 5\n THE CREATIVE TEAM\nWe are pretty proud of the creative team we have assembled for this particular comic.  \nSam Eggleston and Kim Eggleston, who hail from Michigan's Upper Peninsula, are sharing writing duties. Sam has written published comics such as Last Breath, Combat Jacks (with Mark McKenna), Cazadora (with Randy Kintz), The Eighth Day (with Roberta Ingranata) and contributed to the BOOnana Tail Halloween Special (with Mark McKenna). He has several other projects he is currently working on as well. This series marks Kim's first step into writing comics, though she has been a professional writer for the past seven years. She has previously edited Last Breath, The Eighth Day, Combat Jacks 2 and 3, and Cazadora and probably anything else you've seen Sam write.\nJay De Foy is a Michigan-based artist who has been working his way into comics for years. He has his own self-published title, Threadcount, which he successfully Kickstarted, and has previously done work for Zenescope, and, of course, Dead by Wednesday #1.  \nJohn Hunt and Sam Eggleston have worked on several projects together, including Combat Jacks, Last Breath, The Eighth Day and Cazadora. Hunt has worked on various published properties as a colorist and letterer, like Naruto, Star Trek: The Next Generation and Grimm Fairy Tales. He will handle both colors and letters on Dead by Wednesday #2. \nREWARDS\nFirst and foremost, I would like to say that I am sorry for the higher international shipping on this Kickstarter than I have charged in the past, but the last two rounds of international rewards for my campaigns have been insane in terms of price. This isn't meant to discourage international backers... just meant to cover the actual costs. \nArtwork (more will be added throughout the campaign)\nVarious artwork available as rewards\nSketch Covers (more will be added throughout the campaign)\nVarious Sketch Covers\nBatgirl Sketch Cover\nHarley sketch cover\nDead by Wednesday Sketch Covers\nSketches  \nWe've decided to keep things fairly simple this time around. Rewards will focus on commissions by Jason Baroody, Brian Lopez Santos and Jay De Foy. These commissions can be busts or full figure and can be 9x12 or 11x17. \nBaroody has worked with Sam Eggleston on several projects, including Last Breath and Combat Jacks. He is a founding member of Ten Ton Studios.\nLopez-Santos is a California-based artist who is up and coming in the pin-up world. He has offered up rewards on all of Sam Eggleston's Kickstarter campaigns so far.\nDe Foy is the artist for Dead by Wednesday and an all-around swell guy. \nExamples of the cover-quality artwork reward level.\nFULL TRANSPARENCY\nI currently have another project, The Eighth Day, that is still shipping (the comic is done, just a few snags kept all of the packages from going out in February), but everything is on its way and I've been in communication with the backers. I do still have to turn the book into a webcomic, but I anticipate being able to complete that portion of The Eighth Day project in the next couple of weeks.

That series is now being collected into a 104-page softcover graphic novel, but in the meantime we've got another three Semiautomagic stories we would like to include in a special, expanded edition of that graphic novel: a box set including a second, 80-page softcover of new stories.\nSemiautomagic follows the highs and lows (mostly lows) of occult investigator Alice Creed, an average girl from a bad part of town who ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time. A decade after the wrong turn that changed her life, she is who you call when magic ends up in murder. \nBut the magic of Alice's world isn't the cozy, familiar magic of Vertigo books: no myths and legends, no Bast and Queen Mab here. Just the void, and inexplicable, incomprehensible things coming through from other dimensions, other colours of space. Magic itself is a thing with barely understandable rules and many, many unforeseen results. There is a strong element of J-horror, too: one of the ways that predators and parasites come through into our world is via technology, and via places that have some profound impact on our cultural consciousness -- NATO nuclear test sites, for example. This is modern horror, set in the strange nooks and crannies of America, the forgotten places of shadow in our nation. Stay weird, America.\na panel from Semiautomagic: The Bomb That Will Bring Us Together\nAlice is a character that Alex and Jerry developed together, and Jerry was crucial in so many aspects, from her design, to story ideas, to pushing for Alice to be based in New England, an area very familiar to both of us. The book is very scary and very disturbing, but is technically PG. While there is body horror, it is not sexual in nature, nor is there excessive gore or indeed any nudity. To be fair, we didn't need to resort to cheap thrills in Semiautomagic. It's more a book of creeping, unsettling horror that stays with you long after you're done.\nRead the first eight pages of our first Semiautomagic story below! It was published in Dark Horse Presents #4, in 2014.\nThe 104-page softcover is 100% complete. Of the new stories, all are written, and Jerry is well into drawing the longer of his two stories, \"Childhood's End\". Lara has begun work on her story, \"A Town Called Malice\". The series' original editor, Brendan Wright, has joined us on a freelance basis, and Dark Horse is handling design and printing because they have fabulous deals with their printers that we can't even imagine (this means you get a much better quality book, and we get a much lower print bill!).\nDark Horse will be releasing just the 104-page softcover in June. (It's in February Previews right now). They will NOT be selling the box set, or the 80-page new book. The new book is only available as part of the box set in this Kickstarter, and we're only planning to print 1,000 of them. Our box set should be ready to send to backers in August.\nWhat you're getting:\nFunding goal: $21,000\nPrinting, shipping, covers, kickstarter fees, plus art for \"Childhood's End\". \n*Book 1: 104-page softcover collection of Jerry, Alex, and Marissa's two Semiautomagic arcs in Dark Horse Presents: The Bomb That Brings Us Together and Throne of Blood. \n*Book 2: 28-page new Semiautomagic story, drawn by Jerry Ordway and coloured by Marissa Louise: \"Childhood's End\". Alice plunges into Seussian madness while investigating a Howard Hughes-esque recluse in a shuttered Maine mansion. See updates for Jerry's pages in progress!\n*Hardcover case / box with cover by Jerry Ordway.\nnb: printing, shipping and fees is most of this goal. Le sigh.\nStretch goal #1: $26,000\nArt for \"A Town Called Malice\".\n*Book 2 becomes 60 pages, adding a 32-page story drawn by Lara Margarida and coloured by Marissa Louise: \"A Town Called Malice\". Alice's friend Harriet, who is unstuck in time and falls into a different timestream every 24 hours, attempts to rescue a woman who made a wish while burning her wedding bouquet... and is now dealing with the horrifying consequences of that wish coming true. It's about what happens to manic pixie dreamgirls after they marry the damaged hero, and when the manic pixie-ness isn't enough any more to paper over that damage.\nBut why have Lara draw this and not Jerry? Lara is an amazing artist in her own right, and as this is a story about Harriet (not Alice, our usual main character) we thought it would be lovely to bring in a rising star alongside Jerry. Plus, with Jerry already providing almost 40 pages of new story, we wanted all three new stories to be drawn and the box set to be out within a reasonable time after the Dark Horse collection came out -- not practicable if we added another 32 pages to Jerry's workload. See updates for Lara's pages in progress! \nStretch goal #2: $28,000\n Art for \"The Hollow Man\".\n*Book 2 becomes 80 pages, adding a 12-page story drawn by Jerry Ordway and coloured by Marissa Louise: \"The Hollow Man,\" as Alice goes to Los Angeles and finds out what is eating a famous actor. \nStretch goal #2: $31,000\n A Tomer Hanuka cover.\n*Hardcover case/box gets an exclusive Tomer Hanuka cover. Tomer Hanuka is a legendary Israeli illustrator who also provided the cover to Alex's Smoke/Ashes book, and Alex kinda has a thing about unifying design across her books. \n* * *\nOriginal cover for debut instalment of Semiautomagic in Dark Horse Presents #4\nI have questions! Course ya do, sunshine.\nI love Jerry Ordway! Yeah, we do too :D. But I'm really sad you don't have more sketch or commission rewards! We don't have them because we love Jerry. He is already setting aside a massive chunk of time to draw the Semiautomagic pages, and frankly we don't want Kickstarter to eat his life. We also want any commission income to go straight to him. So, if you DO want a Jerry Ordway commission to go with your book, at his normal commission rates, please message us and we'll put you in touch to work that out directly with him!\nAlso where are the prints and posters and buttons and stuff? Do you dig those? For real? Because I've backed like 50 Kickstarter projects and all I really want is the darn book. I have whole drawers of cards and mini-prints and other kerfuffle that got sent along with the darn book that I just... ignore. But hey, you're the boss. If enough of you message us and are like \"we will die if we all don't get buttons\", heck, we'll do buttons.\nBut why isn't Dark Horse just publishing this? Why do you have to Kickstart? Everyone involved in this project has families, and does comics as their full-time career. That means it's pretty hard to be like \"I'm just gonna take three months off getting paid and do some pages for fun\". Alas, our mortgage companies don't take \"exposure\". And graphic novels just don't make enough money that Dark Horse can hand us $30k and be like, \"sure, you crazy kids run along and write/draw more horror stories!\". For example: we are likely to sell as many copies of Semiautomagic in this Kickstarter as Dark Horse will in the first month of the 104-page collection's release. We are so, so thrilled that Dark Horse is being supportive of us and is already helping us so much with design and by letting us leverage the agreements they have with their printers... let's not be greedy, shall we?\nThe first panel of Semiautomagic: Throne of Blood\nWould you do more Semiautomagic stories after this? Heck yes. We have so many we want to do... but we're not cheap dates (we can't actually afford to live on the sort of indie-comic page rates projects like this usually get), and we're doing the book in an unfashionable format: short one- and two-issue stories that sometimes build into other things and sometimes don't, rather than six-issue arcs \"for the trade\" (and the option). I'm really hoping this Kickstarter is successful so we can come back and do another one for more new work after this... perhaps a \"Semiautomagic Annual\" that we could send separately? Oh the dreams we have! But let's get this baby funded first.\nAre there zombies or vampires in Semiautomagic? No.\nWhy not hardcover editions? $$$$. Like, maybe if we hit all our stretch goals and then overfund, I'll upgrade everyone? But for us, more story content is a higher priority than hard covers. What do you think?\nSo what if you do crazy-overfund? Kinda just got a temptation to divide any overfunds around the entire creative team, rather than killing ourselves to do extra stuff. You don't make a lot of money in comics. We're all just scraping by, honestly, and a little bonus would be nice.\nWhy aren't you willing to suffer for your art? Because that's charming at 20 and truly tedious by 40.\nCan I have just the new book? No. \nNo points for guessing he's not a good guy.\nHow did you come up with the pricing for the books? (Cost of creation) / (Print Run) + (Error margin) = Book price. Yeah, we wish it was a bit cheaper too, but even with DH on our side, a box set print run for 180 pages of content ain't cheap.\nI'm a retailer and I want to sell this set in my store. Do you have a retailer package? OKAY FINE I ADDED ONE JEEZ GUYS. Please bear in mind there is the $12.99 Dark Horse 104-pager (eg half our box set) that comes out in June, and our box set won't come out until August at earliest. \nIs this your first time at the rodeo? Oh, heck no. I raised $32,000 in the early days of Kickstarter for my graphic novel Ashes. It proved a far more challenging project than expected, and we did deliver 9 months late. Hopefully making up for that, we delivered twice the book we promised (it became a collected edition of Ashes and its 2005 prequel Smoke), in a better format than promised (cased hardbacks for everyone!), and with a more exciting lineup of artists than promised (Sienkiewicz! Doran! McNeil! Gu\u00e9ra!). And we turned around every book to ship to backers in less than a week after they arrived. So, when life gives you lemons, punch them so hard you shatter the space-time continuum. Or something.\nSEMIAUTOMAGIC: OPENING 8 PAGES\n(Originally printed in Dark Horse Presents #4.

Her recent books No Mercy and Archie vs Predator have achieved both critical and commercial success, and her Grindhouse series at Dark Horse started the recent revival of exploitation-cinema comic books. Valentine, her groundbreaking fantasy-thriller digital comic with Christine Larsen, is widely credited as having established the digital-native storytelling techniques used by the flood of later digital-native graphic stories It's also been downloaded over half a million times. Alex lives in Northern New England with her daughter and a pair of rescue dogs.\nJerry Ordway is a legendary comics artist and writer, known mostly for his work at DC. He has famous runs on Superman, Crisis on Infinite Earths, and Captain Marvel. He can draw anything, from the sweetest and most romantic Superman / Lois portrait to the most visceral horror. He lives in New England with his family.\nMarissa Louise is a Portland-based illustrator, colourist and thinker who has brought her dazzling and modern touch to Semiautomagic from the beginning.\nLara Margarida is a comics and storyboard artist based in the UK. We all love her and she's gonna be the next big thing. You heard it here first.\nBrendan Wright is a freelance editor with nearly a decade of experience in in the field, between Dark Horse Comics, Top Shelf Productions, and independent projects. He was the original, developing editor on Semiautomagic. He is based in Portland.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk with this project is it being late. Though one book (the 104-page Dark Horse Presents collection of Semiautomagic) is already complete and Jerry and Lara have already started on their pages for the 80-page second book, it is never beyond the realms of possibility that an artist could have something come up in their life that means a deadline needs to be missed.\n\nWe have a pretty good infrastructure in place to manage this: the series' original editor Brendan Wright is riding shotgun on everyone; we have Dark Horse itself managing the design and printing; and lord knows I've successfully managed and delivered on a comics Kickstarter before where a lot of unexpected issues came up. (Unlike Ashes, however, this project is: smaller, far more substantially complete, and involves a team I already know well and trust. In other words, maybe I learned my lesson.) \n\nI also feel that the experience of Ashes taught me that backers should be able to ask for refunds at any time up until the book is in the mail, if they are unhappy with the way the project is going or any delays in it. Although we do not expect delays, I really loved the \"anytime refund\" policy we had at Ashes and will continue it with Semiautomagic.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "New ONE WEEK ONLY Kickstarter for two sci-fi graphic novels", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #19", "update_userinfo": "ALL BOOKS ARE SENT", "update_content": "Hey everybody!

(144 pages of story)\nWhat is The Argonauts?\nThe Argonauts \u2014 co-created by writer and Harvey Award Nominee Keith Dallas and artist Robert Saunders\u2014features eight principal characters from different time periods (specifically the Norwegian Middle Ages and the outer rim of the galaxy in the 27th century) who are brought together by an unknown force right before an evil alien race threatens to enslave humanity in modern day America.\nREAD THE ENTIRE FIRST ISSUE HERE\nWhat makes this book different?\nWell, in order to stop the invasion, the heroes will have to overcome the language barriers that keep them from understanding each other. That's right - they don't all speak English! There are no universal translators like Star Trek and it's not a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away where everyone conveniently understands each other. The Argonauts places these heroes in a unique conundrum in order to save humanity. Plus, one is a Norwegian Mountain Giant.\nLet's look at the simple, not at all complicated Rewards.\nWho is The Argonauts for?\nIt's for YOU!\nMore specifically, The Argonauts is for anyone who likes a thrilling, action-packed adventure with intriguing character interaction. Since none of the violence is gory, and all profanity is censored, The Argonauts is appropriate for anyone who can watch a PG-13 movie.\nWhy Kickstarter? Didn't you try this already?\nKickstarter is the most practical method for funding independent print runs (which ain\u2019t cheap). We did run basically the same campaign last year albeit unsuccessfully. However, we really believe in this book and we know readers will enjoy it. And as much as a success as Patriot-1 has been for TJ Comics, we've learned a few things along the way.\nWhere is the money going?\nInto the print run, shipping fees, Kickstarter fees and Amazon fees.The production of the book is finished.

The worlds Kevin creates range from the bayou territory of a lone motorcycle gangster seeking vengeance for his cursed appetite for street meat and the slaughter of his brothers-in-arms (Roadkill du Jour) to dark carnivals overrun by killer clowns violently avenging abused children (Vicious Circus) to dying frontier towns in the Old West beset by Steampunk versions of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (Last Ride for Horsemen) to hellish dimensions replete with untapped energy mined by unsuspecting adventurers ripe for demonic possession (The Absentee)!\nThe Artist\nAmanda Rachels' love of horror has been a heavy influence on her comics work: Vicious Circus, a tale of killer clowns with a twist, and Arcana Studios' The Book, which explores the dark side of traveling off the beaten path. She was a frequent contributor to Grayhaven Comics' The Gathering anthology (including several covers).

Those pages will be collected into individual 24-page comics and will be made available online and at conventions. Currently, it's a black-and-white comic, though we will possibly be adding in colors with a stretch goal. \nThe funding will be used to cover costs of creating and hosting the webcomic for all of 2016 and, hopefully, beyond. But, for certain, a full year of webcomic and the first 24 pages collected into Issue No. 1 and printed for our backers, who will get to see those first 24 pages before anyone else. \nThe Eighth Day was written by Sam Eggleston and is being drawn by Roberta Ingranata and lettered by John Hunt. The story is being edited by Kim Eggleston. \nIngranata and Hunt are both industry pros with Ingranata currently working on Zenescope's Robyn Hood title and Hunt having a background with several major publishers as both a letterer and a colorist. \nSam Eggleston has written several independent books, including Last Breath, Cazadora (soon to be a mini-series from Action Lab Entertainment) and Dead by Wednesday, all of which were successful Kickstarters. Kim Eggleston is also a comic writer (Dead by Wednesday) and has edited just about everything Sam has written. \nThe story\nT8D page 1\nThe Christian bible states that God created everything over the course of six days, and on the seventh day he rested. \nScience tells us that creation takes a much longer time period. That a day, quite frankly, isn't going to cut it. \nWhich one is right? What if they are both right? \nT8D Page 2\nThe Eighth Day tells the story of Devani, who is living life on an Earth that has succumbed to a terrible disease that transforms those who contract it into hideous creatures that cannot be exposed to sunlight and that feed on any living thing they can catch. There are those who are immune to it, like Devani, but their numbers are dwindling and humanity stands on the brink of extinction. \nThe world is quiet. Where once great populations lived in cities, only a few souls still remain. \nT8D Page 3\nDevani doesn't think about how quiet it is. She's focused on surviving each day, collecting what she needs and staying safe indoors at night. But what she doesn't know is that the quiet -- the lack of other people around her -- is about to reveal something amazing: That we were all, indeed, created in God's image. \nT8D page 4\nThe rewards\nWhen it comes to Kickstarters, I have done the really complicated route and the less-complicated route and this time around I'm trying the not-complicated-at-all route. \n\nBasically, you can get hard copies of the first comic, which would be a 24-pager that would give you a nice head start on the story (about six months ahead of the web readers), and you can get prints and other comics and even some commissions. \nFor the commissions, you can get work by Jay De Foy (Dead by Wednesday), Jason Baroody (Combat Jacks, Last Breath) or Brian Lopez-Santos. They all do great commission work and you can see samples of their work by following the links for each of them. \nPLEASE NOTE: Commissions are for ONE character. To add a second character, it will be and additional 50-percent of the purchase. For the 9x12 full-body, for example, it's $100 for one character. For there to be two characters, it will cost $150. Drop me a note if you want more than two characters, or detailed backgrounds. \nOne lucky backer will also be able to get a 9x12 bust commission done by Billy Tucci (Shi, Sgt. Rock). Make sure to grab that one before it's gone because it's limited to just a single backer at the $100 tier. \n\nUPDATE: Roberta Ingranata has made herself available for limited commissions through this Kickstarter.

Colors will be by Michael Woods. Backers will be able to choose between a colored version of the print comic, or black and white. \n$6,250 -- Variety is the spice of life: We'll have a variant cover created and backers will be able to choose if they want the original cover or the variant as their reward. \n$7,000 -- There's always room for more: If we hit $7,000, the creative team will add four pages to the print copy that will ONLY be available in print. The webcomic won't get them. \n$9,000 -- The Eighth Day #2! At this point, we'll be in a good spot to produce the second part of the story in print format. We'll also offer it up in color and in black and white and we'll be sending it to you along with issue No. 1. Please note, however, that we'd probably experience about a two month delay in getting everyone's rewards in their hands. We want to keep the quality the same from start to finish, so we'd want to give everyone ample time to make No. 2 as solid as No. 1. \nHere's an example of the coloring with Page 5. Note how we're looking at a much \"flatter\" feel that I feel exemplifies the mood of the book: \nT8D Page 5\nT8D Page 5 w/ colors by Michael Woods\nComplete transparency\nI just want to make sure everyone is aware that this Kickstarter is running concurrently with another project I am finishing up. Dead by Wednesday was a successful Kickstarter I ran for a comic my wife and I wrote that is currently being printed and will be getting mailed out to backers in June and July. I don't foresee anything being delayed with that project, but I wanted to be able to keep moving with other projects and other creative teams so I decided to move forward with The Eighth Day while I finished up DBW. \n\nIf you have any questions about that, feel free to contact me and I'll answer them for you.

With no signal and lost communication, NASA believed the astronauts were lost forever. They declared the mission a tragic lost and announced the names of those on board. One of those astronauts was Dane Quaid\u2019s brother, Daniel. Quaid refused to accept this. So he asked NASA to coordinate a search and rescue team to find his brother and the rest of the crew. They declined. Desperate to find his brother, Quaid enlisted the help from his father James Quaid, retired space marine; his girlfriend, Casey Hathaway, technologist and long time friend, Bill Richards, weapon specialist. Together they hijacked one of NASA\u2019s most advanced space shuttles.

Was he always destined to be? We also introduce a new \"Villain\". The Persian freedom fighter Sirocco. Is he friend, or the worst type of foe?\nThe story, is a simple one. When I was 14 years old I created my Captain America mixed with The Six Million Dollar Man hero, Cyberine. That is 1985 to you young pups. In Bergen Tech Print Shop, Mr. Pavlu tasked us with creating a flyer for something that interested us. Me being a huge comic fan and also had just read Captain America with Deathlok, I created a character to be in that vein. I was also very patriotic as a teen. I still am. \nCyberine made his first appearance alongside Agent Napalm in Shadowflame #2(1996/2007) to arrest Billy Barnes, also knows as KillWatt the Electrocutioner. He was hired by Don Tony Baltinetti to kill Shadowflame for disrespecting his nephew Tommy. \nThe Cyberines, or United States Cyberine Corps made their first full appearance in Shadowflame #4(1997/2007) where they helped Shadowflame fight and defeat Maldestrak. \nCyberine was in a tragic accident that required the government to make him better, stronger and faster. The cost was a helluva lot more than $6 million dollars.\nThe Cyberines follows a \"family\" of Cybernetic Marines. They are the top tier of elite combat class of soldier: the USCC, the United States Cyberine Corps. Their members are recruited and trained at a young age and then cybernetically or genetically enhanced. This can be due to an accident or injury that has occurred in the line of duty or just to unlock their genetic potential.\nCyberines #1 cover by Cory Hamscher and Sean Forney\nJoe, Jeff and Sean's cover.\nThe Cyberines first appeared in the Shadowflame mini-series from 1996.\nI no longer have the first Cyberine drawing that I did.

It's greatly appreciated!\nBLOODSUCKER BLUES: A VAMPS IN VEGAS STORY is an Amazon Top-10 bestselling novella with a lot of humor and, of course, vampires.\nThe story introduces us to Alex, a vampire who lives in Las Vegas (a thriving vampire community) that ends up in trouble with people he doesn't want to be in trouble with. Along the way, we are introduced to Alex's particular brand of snarky humor.\nThe book has been a success online where it is available for digital download (tinyurl.com/vampsvegas to check it out and read some reviews.) This is the audiobook adaptation of it.\nThe audiobook will be about an hour long, professionally narrated and produced, and will come via digital download or in CD format in a professionally produced, full-color Digipack, depending on which tier you pledge.\nWHO AM I?\nIn addition to being the book's author, I am also a three-time award winning voice actor, podcast host, and audiobook narrator. I've narrated and produced over a dozen audiobooks, and I'm bringing that experience and passion to this project!\nAN EXCERPT FROM THE BOOK:\nEverything you know about vampires is wrong.\nI mean, sure, we do drink blood. And yes, we have fangs, (Have you ever tried to pierce the skin on someone's neck without them? Okay, probably not, but trust me, it's next to impossible.) And, yes, a stake to the heart will kill us, but to quote a popular animated movie, \"Who wouldn't that kill?\" Other than that, a good old-fashioned beheading will pretty much do it, but not much else.\nEverything else you've learned from Hollywood and fiction about vampires? It's generally... well, complete bullshit.\nFor example, sunlight? Listen, I don't want to spend any more time in it than I have to, but mostly exposure to sunlight just feels like a bad rash. It doesn't kill us. Some of us with higher pain thresholds have even taken up tanning. It's a trend in vampire culture lately. We call it \"sunfanging.\"\nAnd we sure as hell don't sparkle.\nWill I cringe if you wave a cross at me? Only if you follow it up with a sentence like, \"Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal lord and savior?\" I have no particular truck with religion, it's just not my thing. And I've never quite understood why people want to go to strangers' houses and talk about god, anyway. That seems like a good way to spend a day getting doors slammed in your face.\nSo how do I know all this?\nSimple. I'm a vampire. And my name... is Alex Blood.\nBwah ha ha ha ha! Oh my god, I'm just kidding! Could you imagine?! The vampire community would eat me alive (no pun intended) if I had the balls to call myself Alex Blood! That's a bit on the nose, don't you think? Holy shit, Alex Blood... please.\nWHAT ARE THE FUNDS FOR?\nI will be using the Kickstarter funds for the cost of producing the CDs, the shipping and packaging costs, and the Kickstarter and Amazon Fees, plus some additional costs for mastering as well as some ancillary equipment for recording. \nWHEN WILL I GET IT?\nThe audiobooks will be delivered via download almost immediately after the Kickstarter campaign ends, while the physical copies will ship out about two weeks after that.

It has a great indie superhero vibe going on, and the story is fun and easy to follow.\" - ComicAttack.net\n\"The makers of this book know comics and know how to make fun comics. I especially like the character designs; original and iconic. This book is worth a look.\" - Ain't it Cool News\n\"Issue #2 ends on a backward Doctor Who moment. What more could I ask for? Dallas, Saunders and Towry make Argonauts a pleasure to experience.\" - ComicsBulletin.com\nREAD THE ENTIRE FIRST ISSUE HERE\nREAD THE ENTIRE SECOND ISSUE HERE\nREAD THE ENTIRE THIRD ISSUE HERE\nWHAT\u2019S IN THE BOOK? \nThe physical graphic novel will contain the previously published Argonauts #1-6 (totaling 143 story pages), Each issue's cover and a gallery of design art and pinups. (If you want to let a more detailed look at Argonauts, go to TJ Comics\u2019 website (http://tjcomics.com/argonauts/) where many pages of the first six issues have been posted.)\nWHAT MAKES ARGONAUTS UNIQUE?\nArgonauts isn\u2019t just another costumed hero comic book. While presenting a science fiction story that involves time travel and alien invasions, Argonauts principally operates on character interaction and the pitfalls of \u201cmiscommunication.\u201d Since all the characters hail from different time periods and different locations, they don\u2019t speak the same language. Therefore, intentions and actions are misunderstood. Even when characters DO speak the same language, confusion still reigns, producing more conflict and strife. As such, a prevalent \u201cTower of Babel\u201d theme runs throughout the narrative, expanding the story\u2019s scope.\nWHO IS ARGONAUTS FOR?\nArgonauts is for anyone who likes a thrilling, action-packed adventure with intriguing character interaction. Since none of the violence is gory, and all profanity is censored, Argonauts is appropriate for anyone who can watch a PG-13 movie.\nTHE CREATORS\nKeith Dallas was editor-in-chief of ComicsBulletin.com for many years before becoming a writer for such comic book companies as Th3rd World Studios (Omega Chase), IDW (Ghostbusters) and Dynamite Entertainment (Stan Lee\u2019s How To Draw Super Heroes). He has written and edited many books for TwoMorrows Publishing including the Harvey Award nominated American Comic Book Chronicles, the decade-by-decade comic book history series, and the best-selling Flash Companion.\nRobert Saunders is a Graphic Artist/Illustrator from Vancouver, Canada. He has been illustrating for over 30 years and his previous comic work includes ARComics: The Frontiers and Bravo.\nOther Argonauts contributors include DC/Marvel artist Scott Kolins, award-winning colorist Moose Baumann, artists Patrick O\u2019Donnell and T.J. Sangalang, colorists Kote Carvajal, Donna Gregory, John Hunt, Omi Remalante and Jon Towry, and letterer Wilson Ramos Jr.\nWHY KICKSTARTER?\nKickstarter is the most practical method for funding independent print runs (which ain\u2019t cheap). Argonauts has been plotted as a three volume project, and the success of this Kickstarter campaign will assure the creators that Argonauts has the reader support to produce more volumes.\nREWARDS\nIn addition to a hard copy of the book, we\u2019ve lined up some unique rewards for various pledge levels including personalized sketches, a rare retailer-incentive copy of a Ghostbusters comic book, American Comic Book Chronicles volumes and participation in a Long Island launch party!\nIf you choose the \u201cArtist Sketch Reward\u201d level, Robert Saunders will draw you a one character sketch similar to what you see below (you choose the character you want Robert to draw).\nWHERE IS THE MONEY GOING?\nInto the print run, shipping fees, Kickstarter fees and Amazon fees.The production of the book is finished.Any leftover funds will go directly into the production of the next Argonauts book.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNONE.

Every backer at the book level and above will receive one of these, numbered and signed by both of us. Every backer who contributes anything will be thanked in the final pages of the book!\nAlso up for grabs are T-shirts, whiskey glasses, commissions by Jack, original pages of Malice and Mistletoe, and an opportunity for you to become part of the book itself.\nWe'll be producing a high-quality, 120-page book with an exclusive cover. Interior pages will be B&W, with splashes of red and green -- kind of a festive Sin City. If our project is funded, we'll introduce stretch goals that will allow us to produce a 140-150 page book with a hardcover.\nWe'll also be signing and numbering every single one of these for no additional charge. You're helping us get them made, so we figure we can write our names down. Want Jack to draw you a head sketch along with his signature? Add $10 to any category and we'll get in touch for more info.\nSelect this option and we'll reach out to you to get a size.\nThese tie right into the book itself. Mistletoe is a sinister whiskey, distilled by Krampus and the elves of the Antarctic. While Kickstarter won't let us offer alcohol (and we're also missing a key ingredient), we are STOKED to be putting these up for grabs. You'll get a pair of 12 oz whiskey glasses -- one red, one green -- laser-etched with the Mistletoe \"M\" logo.\nJack's commissions normally start at $100, which is our project's price point for both a commission and a signed, numbered book. When you select this option, we'll get in touch to find out what you're looking for, be it a character from Malice and Mistletoe, or an entirely different character of your choice. No matter what you choose, it'll be a top-notch piece of original art, on 11x17 paper, ready to frame.\nA lot like the normal commissions, except in full greyscale, with a splash or two of color. These will make for some SERIOUS wall art. Not only that, but Jack normally starts pricing on these at $200, so you're essentially getting one of these bad boys for $45 off.\nWe set these up as part of the $230 level, but you can also add $80 to any reward that includes a normal commission, if one of the others catches your eye.\nWhile we won't be including splash pages, we can guarantee that the pages received from this reward will be highlights from the book. If you select this option, we'll touch base with you in an effort to customize the selection to your preferences (such as whether or not you want something bloody).\nWant to be in our book? You can! If you elect to have a character take on your likeness, you can even opt to have him/her killed. Select one of these rewards, and we'll get in touch to find out how you want your name written, or get a couple pictures to help Jack capture your good looks.\nJust a heads up -- we'll also need a signed release saying it's okay for us to use said name/likeness. And yes, you can definitely select this reward on behalf of someone else, as long as we can get a similar release.\nWould you rather have your company/project namedropped in the book? Get in touch with us beforehand and we'll see if we can make it work.\nSince shipping varies wildly between countries, please reach out to us first. Feel free to e-mail us at maliceandmistletoe@gmail.com. Thanks!\nIf you're a brick and mortar store or a reputable, online retailer, we'd love to work with you during this campaign. E-mail us at maliceandmistletoe@gmail.com, and we should be able to work out a big discount on multiple copies of the book, especially if you're local.\nAll rewards will be shipped together, as soon as we receive the books. We are currently producing pages, and plan to send them to the printers right around the new year. They'll be coming from overseas, so delivery is tough to pin down. We're aiming for early spring, 2015, but it could run as late as May.\nShipping costs are worked into the rewards themselves. Jack has shipped innumerable amounts of art over the years and can assure you that yours will arrive in amazing condition.\nChristmas is business.\n\nToy companies, movie theaters, lingerie boutiques, confectioneries... shit -- even the hospitals clean up. Your grotesque Uncle Alan couldn't turn down that last piece of pie. The \"Ho-Ho Heart Attack,\" they call it.\n\n\nAt the top of this trillion-dollar capitalist empire is Claus, and he traded his furs for bespoke Armani about the same time his rosy-nosed visage started popping up in Coke ads. Now, he sits on the throne of a bona-fide Arctic kingdom, complete with serfs and concubines. Only one problem --\n\nKrampus.\n\nThe infamous Yuletide tot-tormenter. He wasn't keen on the holly jolly direction of the new Christmas, and there was an uprising. When enough blood was shed and Krampus' defeat was apparent, he fled to Antarctica with the few elves who shared his cause.\n\nTogether, over a century, they built a new home. A frozen wild west, where they began to produce a euphoric whiskey called \"Mistletoe.\" Sought after by the world's elite, it afforded Krampus and his followers a chance to rebuild and seek revenge.\n\nThanksgiving night. Six of the world's most powerful CEOs are brutally murdered, with the Mistletoe logo scrawled in blood at every crime scene. Each was a longtime business partner of Claus'.\n\nAnd this is where Eldon Carrillo comes in. To most people, he's nothing but a brooding loner who lives on a secluded estate, deep in the Nordic countryside. To those who've heard the stories, he's a ruthless, ghost-like assassin. To Claus, he's someone who can deliver the best Christmas gift ever -- Krampus' head on a fucking platter.\nPurcell\nJack Purcell is a veteran of comics, having worked on multiple titles for Marvel and DC Comics, including Gotham Underground, Batman, and Green Arrow.\nDavis\nNathan Graham Davis normally works as a screenwriter, and currently has a project in development with 1984 Private Defense Contractors (producers of Dredd and The Grey).\n\nBoth are thankful to live in the artist-friendly town of Easthampton, MA, and both look forward to becoming more friendly artists by way of the above-mentioned whiskey glasses.\nWe're also stoked to announce that Davin Pasek (34-design) will be handling lettering/coloring/design, and Mark (epic Mickey) Stefanowicz will be contributing additional design!\nTHE BACKSTORY:\nThe concept for this project hatched in early 2012 as a bit of midnight inspiration \u2013 the type that wills you out of bed to write it down. A screenwriter, Nathan worked up a treatment, then sent it to his manager and a few friends in the business.\nThe overwhelming response? \u201cNo one in Hollywood will ever touch this. Ever.\u201d It's too dark. Too out-there. You don't fuck with Christmas. So, rather than waste six months of his life writing what would likely be a dead-end, Nathan dropped it.\nFlash-forward to near-Christmas, 2013. Nathan's going through old files, happens upon the treatment, and feels the painful bite of missed opportunity. This idea deserved another chance. Not as a movie, but in a medium that still depended heavily on visuals \u2013 a graphic novel.\nNathan combed through online databases for artists, and discovered there was an incredible, experienced inker, living right in his hometown. He immediately sent Jack a message, saying he loved his work, had an idea, and would he please let him buy him a few beers at the local watering hole.\nJack had been honing his craft for years, drawing and inking for some of the most prolific comic book characters on Earth. He was ready to take that experience to another level, and create something new. The timing was right, he dug the idea, and now we've got months of concept art, extensive outlining, script, and finished pages to show for it. We are ready to dive in and make this thing.\nThat's where you come in.\nWe would love for you to get in on the first-ever printing of Malice and Mistletoe. By backing us, you'll be casting a vote for originality. Your support will help prove that the world doesn't need another paint-by-numbers story. That there's room for something unique, dark, and \u2013 dare-we-say \u2013 really fucking out-there.\nThrough your pledges and support, we're going to make something awesome.\nMore Info:\nFeel free to hit us up with any questions at maliceandmistletoe@gmail.com.

In fact he pencilled and Inked The Story of Pope John XXIII by day and Penciled and Inked Thor by night, All while never missing his Son's athletic events or coaching sports teams. Joe is amazing. \nThis Story was broken up through several issues of Treasure Ches,t and being among Joe's most cherished works, Joe has always longed to see it in a larger, more complete format. The Story of Pope John XXIII is fascinating. \nAngelo Roncalli was born to a working family in a very small poor villiage. one of 13 children, he overcame hardship to become one of the most loved Popes. His life was interesting, as he showed his affection to all people all the time. \nEven the Nazis, allowed him to visit prisoners while he was in Bulgaia, he ministered to Catholics and Non-Catholics alike. When he was sent to Turkey the Bulgarian People were all sad to see him go, he was respected so much. \nJoe's Story flow is spectacular as he illustrates, a wondrous story of a man's life, who was loved so by millions, that he had been made a Saint, on April 27, 2014. To commemorate this, Joe really wanted to print the story in a larger format, in one Beautifully done Hard Cover edition. \nMark Sinnott and I, Scanned each page twice, as they were to big for a large scanner.  I stitched the two scans per page together.  Once prepped, the files were ready for coloring.  I put out a call for a colorists. Mike Deodato told me he had a friend that could handle the job well. Enter Leonardo Ito, currently in Japan.  I showed Leonardo scans, and we came to a more classical look of comics, with a hint of modernism. Also we wanted to correct the original, to be as accurate historically, as we could get it. The original had been colored, but with not a lot of accuracy.  \nJoe Sinnott has been an artist his whole life, in fact, lets see a bit of his biography so you will see what I mean, \nJoe Sinnott (born October 16, 1926, Saugerties, New York, United States) is an American comic book artist. Working primarily as an inker, Sinnott is best-known for his long stint on Marvel Comics' Fantastic Four, from 1965 to 1981 (with a brief return in the late 1980s), initially over the pencils of industry legend Jack Kirby. Years before, he had inked Kirby's The Fantastic Four #5 (July 1962), the issue introducing Dr. Doom, plus a science fiction monster story in Strange Tales #94 (March 1962). In 1964 Joe was contacted by Brian Epstein to pencil, and Ink, the Biography for four lads from Liverpool, for a comic meant to introduce the BEATLES, who would be here in the United States in a couple of months. The book was the Dell Giant Beatles 64 page comic. \nJoe has also produced art for many commercial ads, Record album covers, and logos, through the years as well of some very popular products. During his nearly sixty years as a Marvel freelancer and then salaried artist working from home, Sinnott inked virtually every major title, with notable runs on The Avengers, The Defenders and The Mighty Thor. \nMarvel impresario Stan Lee in the mid-2000s cited Sinnott as the company's most in-demand inker, saying jocularly, \"Pencilers used to hurl all sorts of dire threats at me if I didn't make certain that Joe, and only Joe, inked their pages. I knew I couldn't satisfy everyone and I had to save the very most important strips for him. To most pencilers, having Joe Sinnott ink their artwork was tantamount to grabbing the brass ring\".\nInks\n Here is a sample panel of Joe's work.  This is a single panel of the coronation. Stunning panel.\nLeonardo Ito's Colors.\n The Book will be Approximately 10\" X 15\" to showcase the wonderful work that went into creating it.  55 Pages, With a high quality glossy laminated Hard cover, and fine 128 lb. art pages.\nThe Book will be printed as soon as the Kickstart ends and printer should have them back in 7-8 weeks so they can be distributed as soon as they are signed.\nThe actual Cover art\nSo Thank You for stopping by, and we hope you will take advantage of our incentives to help Joe fund this project.

Instead of a short answer to the question, \"What if zombies attacked?\" I decided to write a \"hypothetical autobiography\" of having to deal with a zombie attack and recalling the events that took place. I have laid out the frames in a \"real-time\" format, there is no break in the action once it starts. I am very excited to have such a talented artist doing the pages, Jordan Johnson. His inking style is exactly what I had in mind for the Black&White Horror look.\n Good Question, but it is not really \"right now\" I started this story almost 10 years ago. I have been writing 3 \"If...\" stories about: Zombies, Winning the Lotto and having Super-Powers. Each story has it's own universe and style, the only connection is that I'm writing them. Also with each story, I wanted to focus on different genres. Zombies is Dark, Hardcore & Violent. Lotto is a drama/comedy. Super-Powers is a mix of everything.  When bringing up the ideas with artists, they all seem to be interested in drawing zombies. I feel like I have new and interesting twist on Zombies. I hope it to be un-like any Zombie story you have experienced before. With over 200 pages in the series, an epic story unfolds over 3 books. This first book focuses on the main characters, the zombies and helps set some of the \"rules\" for the story. The book has been broken up, because there are major changes in the story. I am not actually a big fan of zombies and that is a reason why I wrote this. I want to show how shocking yet pointless zombies are... and that humans, as well as other things are much more dangerous.\nOver the past couple years going to comic-cons, I have noticed a spike in self published comics and the possibility for Kickstarter to help bring your visions to life. Originally this was supposed to be an animated short, so I found myself in need of artists to draw zombies that I could animate, this was much harder than I thought. Since I was already laying out my Superhero story as a comic, I decided to to make all of them in comic form. For many years it was my goal to turn my artist (painters) friends into comic artists for my books. Real Life, families and jobs made it almost impossible for them to dedicate the time needed for a comic. So after a few years I still had very little to show for everything. Even though I kept writing, the thought of these stories ever getting done was becoming slim. I feel that this is the best (and a quicker) way to get this first book done. I have building and working on this Kickstarter since Oct 2013, I am not rushing anything and making sure everything and everyone is ready and making sure there are some fun rewards ready for you backers!\nProbably the most common reason for comics on Kickstarter is to help pay for the Printing of the book, but in addition to this I am asking for help to secure Jordan on this massive project. The writing is finished so my job is pretty much done. My \"payment\" is getting my story out to the world. We already have a few pages done and he is ready to start pumping out the rest of the pages! We would like to be able to print some copies of the preview and other reward items to have for upcoming comic-cons: Fantasticon (April 12th)\nWe are not here to make a profit, if fully funded, every extra dollar will go towards starting the art for part 2 of the book.\nIt is our goal to send the book to print by Late August/Early September. This will allow 2-3 days for each page to be finished and ready for print.\nAlso, if the book is funded and when completed, I will be making a Motion Comic. I will send this as a FREE Thank you Gift to ALL Pledgers! You will get an update on this Kickstarter with link to video when completed.

Then imagine in that moment you are told you have cancer.\nThe Mighty Titan is a character who is for all intents and purposes, invulnerable. He cannot be harmed by any means known to man. His alter ego doesn't have such luck. Titan's alter ego is dying. What now?\nIsn't this the perception that we all have when not touched by cancer? We are all under the belief that we are invulnerable. Aren't we all someone's protector? Aren't we all everything to someone? Not until that lump, or pain, or (un)lucky scan.\nHow we deal with this defines us. How we live with this strengthens us. What we lose is innocence and the loss of a clear mind.\nThis is my epitaph. This is my way of dealing. This is my way of helping others understand what it feels like to be invulnerable...\nAnd then, one conversation, one sentence later... never feeling that way again.\n\"I am sorry, Mr. Martino. You have adeno cell carcinoma.\" were the last words my 33 year old innocent, clear-minded self ever heard. From that day forward, I had cancer. Life was over. Even though, through the support and resolve of my friends, family and doctors. I survived. Twice.\nThe Team\nWRITER/CREATOR: Joe Martino - Joe has been creating comics since he was 10 years old.

Dead Men Tell No Tales) , Trinity Comics (The Wraith) Faust, FemForce and many others.\nCOLORIST: Keith J. Betancourt - For those who know him, Keith is considered a triple threat. He is a penciler, inker and digital colorist. As a colorist, some of his work includes the cover to Time Flyz Volume 8, The DVD Cover to Worst that can Happen (Interspecies Wrestling), art for the NJ hardcore band Ripface Invasion and more from the independent comic Megazeen. Since the age of 2 Keith has been honing his skills, anticipating the day when he can officially break through the comic book world and and show them what he can really do.\nLetterer: Adam O. Pruett - Adam Pruett letters for Image, Antarctic Press, JGM, Arcana, Markosia, Ronin Studios, 215 Ink, and others.

Personally, my introduction was from the classic Disney animated movie.  Most of us have seen the Kevin Costner or Russell Crowe versions as well, but I realized that I have never seen an updated version: a modern-day Robin Hood, where he doesn't exactly \"rob from the rich to give to the poor,\" as the saying goes, but he instead steals medical supplies and gives them to those in need, or those who can't afford them or have no health insurance.  I am sure a lot of people can identify with how expensive health care is in the U.S. these days, and this comic book is a commentary on this, and other, issues.  But don't be fooled, it's also a straight-up adventure story that, hopefully, captures the spirit of the Robin of old.\nCreating comics is a costly venture these days. I wrote the words, but the true masters bring it to life; the artists, letterers, colorists, and cover artists (industry stalwarts Jason Baroody and Mark McKenna) all did amazing work on the book, and should be paid accordingly.

Well, we'll produce a second, variant cover for LAST BREATH and will include it in the packages of everyone who has pledged $50 or more. The cover will be a limited, numbered edition, and after our Kickstarter's pledges are met and our creators each given a copy, there will be no more made available.\n\nBecause $7,500 is such a stretch, we wanted to make your reward something special, and something exclusive.\nThank you to everyone who has backed us so far, and to everyone who will back us from this point forward.

Give up and welcome what is to come beyond this life, or fight until the absolute bitter end?\n\nLast Breath, a 24-page saddle stitched comic, is about a man who has to make that choice.\nHopelessness? The promise of death potentially following each and every breath. Which is his last? And what can he do about it? \nWith the world being torn apart before his very eyes, astronaut Jason Gustafson has no way to get home, and his oxygen is quickly depleting.\nThe story is one that speaks of the human spirit, and how the desire to live can push us even when we don't think we can take another step.\nPage 1 for Last Breath\nThe creative team\nSam Eggleston is the writer of Last Breath. He has been a professional award-winning journalist and columnist since 2000 and a full-time freelance writer and editor since 2008. He has been an avid reader of comic books most of his life and has written several scripts for comics slated to publish in the next year. He also edited Mark McKenna's Combat Jacks, which was originally published in 2012. \nJason Baroody is mostly known for his work in the comic book industry. He's had several comics published, AIT/PlanetLar, Image, 5Finity/Moonstone, Sixgun Comics to name a few. He's written several articles and illustrated advertisements for multiple comics related magazines as well as film artwork for Illuminati Pictures. He\u2019s a founding member of TEN TON STUDIOS and once worked and owned a small independent comic book publisher Disgruntled Fanboy Comics. His work can be viewed here.\nJosh Oakes is relatively new to the comics industry, but you can't tell from the quality inks he turns in on each and every page. His inking work can be seen in his Deviant Art gallery.\nJohn Hunt has been working in the comics industry as a letterer and a colorist for quite sometime. His credits begin back in 2004 when he worked on Tokyo Pop's \"Girls Got Game\" and as a letterer includes Marvel Super Heroes Magazine, Combat Jacks, Nurato, Seekers and more. As a colorist, you've seen his work in numerous IDW Star Trek series, the World's Deadliest Sharks graphic novel and Charmed, among others. View some of his work here.\nMark McKenna recently agreed to do the inks for the cover (example of the cover is coming soon). McKenna is a legendary inker, having more than 450 titles to his name and more than 7,000 pages. He is also an Inkwell Hall of Fame award recipient and recently launched his own titles, Banana Tails and Combat Jacks. The latter he worked on with Baroody, Hunt and Eggleston, among others. You can visit his website here.\nBrian Lopez-Santos, Jason Adams, Jay De Foy, Sean Forney, Te'Shawn Dwyer and Randy Kintz have helped on this project as creative consultants and part of our support team. You can see some of the work Lopez-Santos has done here, and Rantz's work is available here. Adams work is available here, while Forney's can be viewed here. Go here to see De Foy's work and here for Dwyer. \nPage 2 for Last Breath\nWhy Kickstarter?\nLet's be honest here: Making a comic isn't easy, and it sure isn't cheap to bring it to life in the form of a printed book. Knowing how supportive the comic community can be on a crowd-funding site such as this, Eggleston, Baroody and Oakes made the decision to turn to the legion of comic fans out there and ask for a little help in getting their comic launched.\nYou have lots of choices when it comes to choosing a comic to back, but we're hoping to be able to pique your interest with a solid story, quality art and a compelling protagonist.\nA sample panel from one of the pages of Last Breath.\nBut why are you asking for the amount you're asking for?\nTruth be told, none of us began this journey looking for a payout, and anyone in the know about the cost of creating comics can tell you that there is no room for profit being built into what we're asking for. The $4,500 will be used to cover the cost of having the pages finished (drawing, inks, gray tones, lettering) and getting a limited number of comics printed. Additionally, the costs associated with Kickstarter and Amazon payments have been built in, as well as the creation and shipping of the rewards.\nDo you have any stretch goals?\nOh, for sure. If we're able to make it to $5,500, then we will have additional copies of the book printed to hopefully sell online and via local comic book stores. \nIf we reach $6,500, we will likely get the entire interior colored as well, and if we reach $7,000 and beyond, we will use the additional funds to begin work toward additional comic projects.\n\nSome of the rewards\nHere are a couple of the rewards that we have ready to go already.\nThese sketch cover rewards are still available.\nThese sketch cover rewards have all been claimed.\nAdd ons\nAt the request of a couple of backers, we have decided to put \"add on\" rewards on the list. The way this works is you add the amount of the corresponding reward (listed below) to your current pledge and then drop us a note and let us know you'd like to have an add on and which one(s).\n\nExtra issue(s) of LAST BREATH: $10 each (unlimited) -- Larger quantities can be discussed at discount pricing, of course.\n\nHeadshot of your favorite character by Jason Baroody or Brian Lopez-Santos: $20 each (unlimited) -- This will be on 9x12 paper and is a shoulders-and-up shot of any character you choose.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith any project, there are challenges and risks. Right now our biggest challenge is getting enough money to get the remainder of the comic finished. \n\nWe don't foresee any delays on getting the comic out on time, but that's always something that looms in the air. We believe we've built in plenty of room for deadlines, however, and that the entire process should go off without too much of a hitch.\n\nIf any setbacks arise, we'll be open and honest about the delays and stay in communication with our backers via Kickstarter.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #45", "update_userinfo": "Last Breath creative team's newest project", "update_content": "Hey gang, \n\nThanks so much for your support back when we launched Last Breath.

Aardwolf lacks an advertising budget and while I believe my 370-page tome is as important as anyone's capsulated history of comics, I need folks to know it exists.\nPerks have been going out regularly, too, and we're just 30 days from hard copies. The book will be very short-printed, as promised, so once it's gone, people will have to purchase the digital version if they want to see what all the fuss was about."}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 70, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1626567590/comicbook-babylon-the-real-villains-and-heroes-of", "project_name": "ComicBook Babylon: The Real Villains & Heroes of Comics"}}, {"backer": "Mark McKenna", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 70, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1461073089/chrono-mechanics-potholes-in-the-cosmic-road", "project_name": "Chrono Mechanics: Potholes in the Cosmic Road"}}, {"backer": "Mark McKenna", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "WHAT IS THIS?\nThis a brand-new steampunk adventure series whose first story will be told in three 48-page issues. Our hero, Dr. Quentin Bowlsby, or \"Q\" for short, falls into a mystery after he is asked to retrieve an item from a train crash by gov't agents. Once there, however he uncovers evidence of the presence of an old adversary, piquing his interest in the case. One thing leads to another and soon he's...well you're just gonna have to read it.\nThis Kickstarter campaign is the to get the ball rolling, so to speak. Well, that's not entirely true. The ball started rolling well over a year ago, when we sprouted the idea for the story, but this is the first time we are seeking outside funding to pay our creative team and print the book. Depending on how much we can generate here, we can possibly fully fund all three 48-page books with just this one campaign, that would be a perfect world.\nWHO ARE WE?\nThe creative team for this inaugural installment of \"The Steamworld Chronicles\" is as follows:\nStory and script are by Steven Hoveke & Mike Scigliano. The interior artwork and all conceptual designs are courtesy of Ben Risbeck. Coloring for the artwork is by way of Jeff Balke. Leaving the all-important lettering of the project in the able hands of John J. Hill.\nSteamworld Chronicles can also be found on FACEBOOK and TWITTER\nHere's an example of the artwork we are producing : Page 11\nPage 11 pencils/inks\nPage 11 color\nUPDATE! We have our first color page just in time for the big final push! SEE! We told you it's gonna be in color!\nMore info about each member of the creative team can be found at our website by clicking the link below.\nThis first issue of the \"The Steamworld Chronicles\" is the launching point for a planned series of adventures. This first issue of a planned three 48-page issues will tell the tale we have sub-titled \"The Constantine Quest\"\nFuture tales will tell of more adventures of Dr. Quentin Bowlsby, his longtime friend and boss Clifford Weston and the ever expanding cast of characters. We have big plans for this world. Several story outlines have already been scribbled down and merely await the completion of this one. The world which we have created is rich and deep, and one day we hope to invite others to come create in it as well.\nWhat we are raising the money for? Our artists will LOVE being paid to do what they love to do. Our Kickstarter funding amount is set to cover our creative costs, to have the artwork drawn, colored and lettered. It DOESN'T include the writers, Steve and Mike, who are foregoing getting paid for the work done on this project until the artwork is paid for. If our funding goal is met, whatever overfunding occurs will go towards the production of Issue #2, and eventually #3. Only THEN, will Steve and Mike see any money out of this. It's really the only way. They can't draw this thing, and without art, they might as well be writing books.\nOur hopes are that the book will get picked up by a publisher and help us to offset the creative and printing costs, but we are fully aware of the wealth of amazing projects there are out there and if we can't get the help we need from an established publisher, we're ready to publish it independently. We think that once word gets out about the first issue, we won't have to worry about this problem for long, but that's our opinion. We may be biased.\nOne other thing, please check out our stretch goals for the campaign below. They have been designed to allow us to give more to each person who donates, as the funded amount rises. As an example, If we reach $20k, then every person who pledged $10 to get issue #1 will automatically get a copy of Issue #2...no extra charge. This is designed with the idea that the more people who everyone can get to pledge support for us, the more everyone will benefit.\nSo, please pass the link around and everyone wins.\nAlso, follow us on TWITTER\nAnd come like us on FACEBOOK\nSTRETCH GOALS REVEALED\nWhen we originally pitched our idea to Kickstarter, they thought our stretch goals were a little vague and wanted us to keep them hidden until further along in the campaign. As we approach our funding goal, I think it's high time we release them.\nThe concept is simple. The more people who support and pledge, the more stuff EVERYBODY gets.\nHere's the basic idea. When we started out we were looking for just under $10k. Which is $10 x 1000 people. Simple, right? So those 1000 people all get  the first issue for their $10 pledge. Now, here's where it gets awesome. IF those 1000 people could each talk JUST ONE other person into spending $10, that's another 1000 people, and another $10k. At that point, everybody who has pledged $10 or more, gets not only part 1, but they get part 2 as well, for FREE. One more step, if the 2000 people who have pledged $10 each can get another 1000 people between them, then we have $30k and all 3 books are fully funded and EVERYBODY gets all 3 books (upon completion) for JUST $10!!\nThat was our masterplan. Now , I doubt at this stage we can double our pledges, but it's worth a shot, right? So go tell your friends and have them tell their friends. And honestly, we don't need 3000 people because you now someone will want some cool sketches or prints and those pledges count as well so, if someone pledges for one of the sketchbook rewards, that's like 7 people pledging for $10!! It'll add up fast, so get those Facebook and Twitter accounts rolling! EVERYBODY WINS!!\nUPDATE! WALTER SIMONSON's Cover pencils prelims\nWalter Simonson cover image pencil prelim\nHere is the 1st pencil prelim from Walter for the cover art for issue #1. How awesome is this?

As you all know, we originally had a delivery date of this month, March. Well, for many reasons I am going to outline here, we will not be making that deadline. I apologize for this. I am one of the creators and one of the ones spearheading the overall project. I think that the primary reason we're running late is, ultimately, lies at the feet of the fact that we had such a successful Kickstarter. By helping us achieve $3k OVER our intended goal, it allowed us to hire a real professional inker in Mark McKenna and that instantly put us behind, as we had to begin the inking process from the start again. I, as the original inker had finished almost 15 pages and had starts on the other 10 when we brought Mark aboard. It was last minute, so Mark had some other jobs to finish before being able to fully commit to Steamworld, but he has steadily managed to fit chunks of our pages into his schedule and is now working solely on our pages in an effort to finish them as quickly as possible. Our colorist has been in and out of town making his living doing what he does but will begin a long homestand this week and will be cranking out pages faster than you'd think possible, so we're about to see a big jump in the project towards it's final outcome. Our current new goal is to have the book in hand by the end of April, so we can have copies ready for a signing we have scheduled on the Sunday after Free Comic Book Day on Long Island (if any of your are in the area, we'd love to have you come by and say hello) Mike and I will be there along with Walter Simonson and Mark McKenna at Grasshoppers Comics in Williston Park, NY We are getting printer quotes and will be posting colors and the final cover art very soon. We have a final script for issue #2 that Ben will be starting the pencils on imminently. We appreciate your support and understanding as we tackle these final few obstacles to ensure we deliver the finest product we can to you. I wish we could get them out now, trust me, I'm dying to hear what you guys think. It's close, folks, just a little longer I promise.

Please enjoy, and tell the world about this new, improved version of this backer reward!!\nWhat's This All About?\nThis Kickstarter project is all about getting a quality comic book on the shelves and into your hands. But, it's more than that: it's the culmination of over a decade's worth of work: writing, designing, developing... All leading up to this day.\nWho Is \"WatchGuard\"? Teen Force 5?\nWatchGuard & Teen Force 5 are two separate entities residing in the same universe, which I call the WatchGuard Universe, or WGU, but they reside at different times. WatchGuard, the focal point of the stories I have to tell, exist today. And so, their stories will be more modern, reflecting the world around them. Teen Force 5 on the other hand, existed before WatchGuard, roughly in what would be our 1990s era. As such, TF5's stories are more 'retro', harkening back to a time that seemed simpler to us, and to them.\nWatchGuard\nWhat Can I Expect From The Story?\nWell, there are two stories being told, as you've probably deduced already. One story focuses on the developments leading up to the formation of WatchGuard, so it's essentially the origin story. It's filled with plenty of action, so don't worry that the origin will slow down the pace any!\nThe Teen Force 5 story is kind of an origin, but not really. We're introduced to the team, minus two, and we'll eventually have these latter two join up. They will go from Teen Force, to Teen Force 5 and stay that way until they retire altogether from superheroics. So, call it an origin story if you will, but it's just another tale in the middle of many I have stored in my head for these guys! :)\nTeen Force 5\n2 Teams! 2 Eras! 2 Pilot Stories! 44 Pages! ONE comic book!!\nBOTH the WatchGuard -and- the Teen Force 5 pilot stories will be told as independent adventures, but in one, double-sized, massive comic book! The comic book will feature two covers ('front' and 'back'), each representing the beginning of each story. The WatchGuard story will feature the WatchGuard cover, and the Teen Force 5 story will feature the Teen Force 5 cover, all in 'flip book' style (\u00e1 la Youngblood #1, c.1994) -- so you'll know where to start reading! :)\nStill confused? Please drop me a note and ask away!\nWho's The Creative Team Behind All This?\nFor starters, there's me: Charlie. I self-published my first project, The WatchGuard Sourcebook, back in 2011 and wrote nearly the entire book. Gaming adventures were added by DT Butchino, an experienced writer for gaming supplements, and edits were by author V.V. Wedding. So, I'll be your Writer.\nAs for art, well, sit down for this!\nOn the WatchGuard story we have the dynamic artist Andy Smith, who's lines have graced books such as: Green Lantern, X-Men, DC Comics: WWIII, X-O Manowar, The First (from CrossGen), Batman, Armor X, and more. His clients include Marvel, DC, Image, Wildstorm, Advent Comics, Ominous Press, Dynamite Entertainment, Green Ronin Publishing, and more. Andy is a pro with more than two decades experience in the comic book world!\nJoining Andy will be Andrew Dalhouse on colors. Andrew has colored JLA, Teen Titans, Irredeemable, Anita Blake and more!\nAs for the Teen Force 5 story, we'll have penciler extraordinaire Kevin Sharpe! Kevin has drawn everything from the Legion of Superheroes, to He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, and on into Nova (Marvel Comics)!\nJoining Kevin will be inker Diana Greenhalgh, who worked over his lines previously on Nova #25 and an as-yet unreleased mini-series from Image Comics.\nRounding out the art for TF5 is colorist Eddy Swan. Eddy's clients include several independent publishers, including Zenescope. His previous work on the WatchGuard Sourcebook was so stellar, we decided he's a keeper!!\nOk, Cool! So, What's This Funding Going To Do?\nAll funding will go into the latter portions of the creation of this book, to include, but not be limited to the publishing fees, printing fees, promotional materials, and possibly distribution fees. The intent is submitting this project to Image Comics, but that will come after this Kickstarter is completed.\nIdeally, we'll be able to take this to the next level and begin production on a mini-series for one (both?) properties. That's the point behind the \"pilot\" issues anyway, right?\nSo, go! Vote with your mouse by clicking \"Back This Project\", and enjoy your rewards!!\nReward Achievements to Unlock!\nIn addition to the regular rewards listed to the right, as we progress successfully toward our goal, you'll be able to unlock new rewards!

The added twist is that we don't know the identities of these supposed heroes...readers will find out when our main characters do!\nThe New Age Heroes!\nUnmasked is action packed with a love story, coming of age themes and a moral dilemma in an age surrounded by questionable leaders and the threat of society collapse.\nIf you decide to back the Unmasked Kickstarter project, some of our incentives include:\nYour choice of T-Shirt\nDagger II mask and 27\" x 40\" movie poster\n11\"x17\" Poster\nMore choices T-Shirt!\nOriginal Inked (not colored) 11\"x17\" Unmasked covers, signed by John Broglia and Michael Sarrao\n4\" x 6\" Print\nOriginal Inked Unmasked Overdrive 5 page short story\nTHE CREATIVE TEAM:\nMichael Sarrao \u2013 Creator and Writer\nJohn Broglia \u2013 Artist\nGiuseppe Pica \u2013 Colors\nKristyn Ferretti \u2013 Letters and Design\nNick Filardi \u2013 Cover Colors\nTim Daniel \u2013 Logo Design\nAlex Amezcua \u2013 Guest Artist\nJesus Antonio \u2013 Guest Artist\nUNMASKED TRAILERS:  Want to know more about Unmasked?

I'd never read it, or at least I don't remember reading it, but I was profoundly moved by it. It was strange, but it's like a personal metaphor of the way my life has been going for the last two years. There are things happening around me, big things, personal things. Some will happen sooner than later. \nI find myself disturbed by the tone some things are taking in the industry. Darkness where darkness didn't dwell, bitterness for the sake of \"relevance\". it seems that in certain corners, there's no room for magic, and light. It bothers me more than I can say. This not to say that superhero stories can't be serious, or adult. However you can achieve those things without making them dire, and unlikeable. I need to be the one to make the changes I want to see.\n I can only say \"I\" because my tastes only end at the tip of my nose. There is room for fun, there is room for magic, there is room for genuine good in comics.I need to be the agent of change now. I've been moving towards it, now I need to step up that effort.\nOh, the places I will go.\nWho am I?\nMy name is Jamal Igle and I\u2019m a 22 year veteran of the comic book industry, having drawn everything from Action Comics to Firestorm the nuclear man, 52, Countdown, Daredevil/Shi, Iron Man, Iron Fist/ Wolverine, KISS, New Warriors, Noble Causes, Nightwing, Spider-man, Supergirl, Superman and Zatanna. My work has appeared in projects for the European market such as L'arm\u00e9e Des Anges for Les Humano\u00efdes Associ\u00e9 and Perry Rhodan, reprinted in a number of languages internationally. I\u2019m also a former editor, marketing executive and art director, I\u2019ve worked in television animation on series such as Roughnecks: Starship Troopers Chronicles and Max Steel. Last year, I received the Inkpot Award for achievement in comic art. Currently I\u2019m completing work on KISS for IDW Publishing and SMALLVILLE Season 11 for DC COMICS.\nWHO IS.....\nMolly Danger is the story of the world\u2019s most powerful 10-year-old girl. A seemingly immortal, super strong hero, Molly has protected the city of Coopersville for the last 20 years.\nAn animated styled Molly treatment Rich Maurizio and I drew in 2004\n\nKept in constant isolation and watched closely by D.A.R.T. (The Danger Action Response Team) an organization created to assist in her heroic deeds and monitor her movements, Molly battles the Supermechs. A team of cybernetically enhanced beings with unusual powers, Molly always defeats them and yet they always managed to mysteriously escape. Molly longs for a real life, with a real family, something she\u2019s been told she can never have. Her life changes when D.A.R.T. recruits a new pilot, Austin Briggs. Briggs has his own motivations for joining the team, newly remarried; Austin is having trouble forming a relationship with his new stepson, Brian. Austin wants to use his connections to impress Brian, an avid Molly Danger fan. However things get turned on its ear when Molly and Brian form a friendship of their own.\nShe believes she\u2019s an alien, whose family died when their ship crash-landed on Earth and before the atmosphere could fully alter them. She also believes that she\u2019s alone, the last of her kind.\nEverything she knows is wrong.\nThe Origin of Molly Danger\nThe original character turnaround sheet I drew back in 2001\nMolly was conceived originally on a car ride with my friend, Rich Maurizio back in 2001. At the time we were trying to pitch Molly as an animated series but later decided to re-envision the project as a comic book series. We began production 2002; with the intention of self-publishing through Rich\u2019s company Airwave Comics. \nAs my career picked up it became harder for me to take the time to draw the book. We then hired another artist (Sonic the Hedgehog Artist Jamal Peppers) to redraw the script I had written at the time. Eventually the project fell apart due to time commitments. I never abandoned the concept and would continue to revisit the possibility over the next three years. In the mean time, life changes. I signed a six-year exclusive contract with DC Comics. I got married and had a daughter; I became a teacher and a lecturer, traveling around the world to conventions and conferences. In all that time, I never abandoned my girl. \nIn  2008 I became the artist of the comic book series, Supergirl and something became very clear to me. Whenever I would talk to fans, two things kept coming up. One was the lack of all ages\u2019 material in the U.S. Comics market. The second was the lack of female heroes who weren\u2019t an offshoot of a male hero or weren\u2019t sexually exploitive. That\u2019s when the seed really began to take root again and why I\u2019m now attempting this massive undertaking. This is my solo first creator owned project. I also co-created the miniseries Venture with Noble Causes,Dynamo 5 and Near Death writer/ creator Jay Faerber in 2003. \nThis, however, is a story that I feel needs to be told and that now is the time to tell it.\nSample art\nWhat will the money be used for?\nMolly Danger is planned as a 4 book 8.5 x 12 Hardcover, European format Graphic Album series scheduled to be published beginning September/October of 2013. I'll be re-writing the script and redrawing the book, since I think I've improved artistically since 2004.\nEssentially you're pre-ordering this limited edition. \nThe money will go to the production, printing and shipping of a Molly Danger: Book One limited edition of 2000 copies available only to Kickstarter backers. The funds will also be used to create and ship the incentives being offered.  Any additional funds raised for  Book one will immediately be used for Book Two and so on. The series is set to ship bi annually (Two books per year) and once completed will be packaged as a collected 200 page graphic novel.\nWe also stretch rewards planned should we surpass our initial funding goal.\nAs you may be aware, producing a book of this type, in the format size and scope I'm planning is an expensive endeavor. The money raised will be used to hire professional talent to help me flesh out Molly's world.\nArt by Sonic the Hedgehog artist, Jamal Peppers \n I have assembled a top-notch creative team in inker Juan Castro (G.I.Joe: Snake Eyes for IDW, Incorruptible for Boom Studios, Elders of the Rune Stone) and Colorist Michael Watkins (Sonic the Hedgehog, Transformers).\nI've teamed up with Action Lab Entertainment, a publisher known for their high quality, all ages, creator owned products, such as the Glyph award and Will Eisner Award nominated series Princless. They also feature other diverse genre projects such as Jetta: Tales of the Toshigawa, Fracture and Double Jumpers.\nFormed by four independent creators with over 20 years of media experience and creator-owned content, Action Lab Entertainment\u2019s goal is to develop, create and distribute original comic book series as well as create original animated and various forms of entertainment that challenges and competes with the media industry as a whole.\nConcept art of the Supermechs Bonnie Double, Two Fisted Tommy and Lil' Cavey\nWhy aren\u2019t you drawing it now? Why wait until December?\nMostly because I\u2019m currently busy with other projects, However I'm currently hard at work writing a new draft of the book one script. The plan is to begin penciling in December and have book one completed by July of 2013\nWhy should I pledge to this project?\n Molly Danger is a concept and a character that I believe is needed in the current marketplace. I\u2019ve been in this business a long time and have watched it become darker and direr for years. As the father of a young girl, I\u2019ve found myself disheartened that there isn\u2019t a female superhero character for my daughter to read that hasn\u2019t been turned into a killer, or overtly sexualized. A character that isn\u2019t joined at the hip to a male hero or subservient to one. I like to think of Molly as a cross between Astroboy and the Powerpuff girls, the perfect type of character for young, burgeoning superhero fans. \nThere's room in the comics market place for more all ages action adventure stories.\nI believe in Molly, so much so that I'm putting my money where my mouth is. One person who pledges $10,000 dollars or more will receive 38 pages of original art from Book one. Ten others who donate $1,000 or more will receive a page on top of the other incentives I'm offering starting with:\nThe D.A.R.T.  Membership Card which will give you exclusive members only access to the Molly Danger production blog. Backers will be able to track the development from scripting, to design to finished pages, etc.\nNot final product\nMolly Danger T-Shirts and More!\nAll rewards will be shipped in stages\n The membership cards will ship to all backers first followed by posters, T-shirts, preview material and the rest. There will be new rewards shipped to each backer at each stage of completion.\nThank you for taking the time to look at my Kickstarter page and for your kind consideration.\n$500 commission reward sample", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #69", "update_userinfo": "The new Molly Danger Campaign is now live!", "update_content": "We're up and running.

Brandon wrote the book, played editor in many ways, did the bulk of correspondence with Image, did most of the Kickstarter work (and believe me that's a lot!), and was the one behind I think all of the extra ideas that have made this pretty special.

I\u2019ve already had some talented artists consent to help me play with the idea of doing a sketchbook which will be out in time MidOhioCon in October, 2011.\nHelp Ursula battle the Undead in this sketchbook!\nHi.\nMy name is Bill Nichols and I\u2019m a writer and inker of comics books as well as an editor, most notably of Sketch Magazine, the magazine about the comics-creating process. I\u2019ve been around comics most of my life and have been most things you can be in comics: reader, collector, retailer, and creator.\nOver the years, I\u2019ve accumulated my share of characters and stories and set them in my own personal playground called Sparta Bay, an East Coast city that is home and habitat to a great number of the world\u2019s AMPS (amplified beings) whether they are super, scientific or mythical.\nSo, I decided it was time to shoot for having something definite going on with this Sparta Bay imprint. I\u2019ve already had some talented artists consent to help me play with the idea of doing a sketchbook which will be out in time Wizard World Chicago in August, 2011.\nContributing to the sketchbook are artists like Gary Barker, Neil Vokes, Steven Howard, Chris Noeth, Rudy Garcia, Fred Lang and others. And some will be inked by me.\nAnd I'll be including an original Ursula short story, written by me, of course.\nThe Ursula Sketchbook is the first effort in all this. Starting as a collaboration with Gary Barker, Ursula is the story of a young heroine trying to live up her family legacy as a Valkyrie-type and at the same time, live some kind of normal life. She has a natural aversion to the undead of all types, which are anathema to her. It\u2019s unnatural to be dead but still walking around. Of course, this constantly puts her in situations where she must deal with those undead-of-all-types.

Anything above and beyond that will set the stage for the first mini-series, the first of several if I have anything to say about it.\nAnd I do.\nThank you for giving this a look.
