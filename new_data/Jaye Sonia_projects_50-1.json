Since then I've been playtesting epic games with berserkers able to fell fortresses with one momentous blow, druids transforming into the land itself, and wizards reworking magic in the most wondrous ways! Now I've got a 128 page sourcebook that provides everything you'll need to go beyond the core ruleset\u2014or to fill up the GM's toolbox with a host of new epic creatures if you're already there.\n\nSimple Pledge Rewards\nThis is a straightforward project\u2014pledge for the PDF or pledge for the hardcover. There are plans for stretch goals to bring in other designers to provide more epic content supplements as add-ons, but by keeping this Kickstarter simple we can swiftly deliver your rewards because the initial book has already been proofed and copies will begin shipping within 2 weeks of the funding period's end.\n\nNote: Every stretch goal we unlock is being added for free to each pledge for a PDF or hardcover of Legendary Adventures. As these become available you will get emailed codes for a PDF download and an at-cost print voucher (if you want a softcover from one of these stretch goals it'll cost what it costs in ink, paper, glue, and shipping). \n\nWhat's in the book?\n Epic rules for every character class\u2014attack with devastating swiftness, transform into the land itself, see magic in all its intricate glory, and much more\n 18 Epic Feats to choose from to customize your legendary adventurer. Transform one of your favorite magic items into a sentient creature, become resistant to types of damage, emulate the legendary resistance of monsters.\n 10 Epic Hazards including antimagic clouds, wild magic zones, planar bleeds, and other environmental anomalies to keep battles exciting as the threat of foes increases.  \n Over 50 monsters ranging from all-powerful gods of magic to the Four Harbingers of the Final Judgment, assassins from the future, and elementals formed from lava.\nEpic Archetype Support\nAmong the more painful decisions when making this book was how to approach archetypes for epic play. One thing that makes legendary adventurers so deft is that you gain *more* than one archetype for your class\u2014your assassin can also become an arcane trickster, or your evoker can learn to master divination! But what of making archetypes themselves epic? At 25th and 30th level legendary adventurers acquire additional prestige, and at the GM's discretion they can also (or alternatively) acquire epic features for every archetype from the 5E ruleset. These epic archetype features are not included in the core rulebook because this isn't intended to be a lengthy tome but all 19,000 words of them are available for free at www.epic5e.com!\n\n\u2694\ufe0f Stretch Goal: Epic Depths - UNLOCKED \nMerlin summons the party to his tower for a dire task\u2014find where important figures from across the globe have gone and free them from captivity. Of course once the adventurers discover what's really going on it's a whole lot bigger of a problem than some kingly kidnappings and missing empresses.

Each of these titans has created armies to assail the capital city of an alien warlord, eager to claim their prize\u2014the enchanted heart implanted into the warlord's body. The adventurers may choose a side or fight for themselves, but to learn more of the Trekth they must end the siege and vanquish any forces that would continue the conflict.\n\nWhat you'll find in Heart of War: \nAn adventure on a different world for PCs of 22nd level.\nStatistics for elite alien shock troops, the alien warlord, and battalions of elementals (air, earth, and fire).\nThe Heart of Primordial Flame, a potent artifact that offers whoever takes it great power\u2014but not without cost.\nMore details about the mysterious Trekth and the effects of their world runes.\nPregenerated adventurers of 22nd level for every class.\nA printer-friendly black and white file in addition to the regular PDF.\nEveryone who pledges for a PDF or hardcover of Legendary Adventures will receive the PDFs for Heart of War at no additional charge, as well as a print on demand voucher to get a softcover of the adventure for the cost of paper, ink, glue, and shipping.\n\n\u2694\ufe0f Stretch Goal: Forgotten Crowns  - UNLOCKED \nThis third adventure (also free for project backers) is for 23rd level PCs and penned by a trio of talented designers: Jocelyn Gray, Josh Gentry, and Peter Martin. Palatia, the Ruler's Rest, is a dimension of floating isles where those of noble achievements and royal blood spend the afterlife. Eons ago the emperor god Leviatos died and since then his planar home has slowly frayed and weakened, only breaking just now. The long dead kings and empresses that dwell there have slowly gone mad in the absence of their deity, and the broken energies sustaining their home are trapping dimensional travelers\u2014and worse. Things from beyond and below have begun to invade Palatia, hastening its end and the total destruction of any soul within.\n\nWhat you'll find in Forgotten Crowns:\nAn adventure in a dying dimension for PCs of 23rd level.\nStatistics for new epic level adversaries, including planar-eating arnsenons.\nBattles within the rib cage of a dead god and across islands that float in midair.\nMore details about the mysterious Trekth and the effects of their world runes.\nPregenerated adventurers of 23rd level for every class.\nA printer-friendly black and white file in addition to the regular PDF.\nEveryone who pledges for a PDF or hardcover of Legendary Adventures will receive the PDFs for Forgotten Crowns at no additional charge, as well as a print on demand voucher to get a softcover of the adventure for the cost of paper, ink, glue, and shipping.\n\u2694\ufe0f FINAL GOAL: Dismantling Cities - UNLOCKED\nThis supplement for 24th\u201326th level characters is a GM handbook for how to run epic fights against sentient cities.

However, due to the use of game settings owned by other publishers, none of these works could be published and brought to the public as a standalone adventure. When Storm Bunny Studios licensed The Game Academy full rights to create and publish within the World of Alessia, they also granted us the opportunity to develop the content for one of Alessia's main continents, Shiran. When presented with this land of verdant forests, frozen tundra, a barrier mountain range, and the frozen wasteland of The Vastness, The Game Academy fell in love and got straight to work. While we are being intentionally vague about the plot of our story (we don't want to ruin it for anyone who desires to play), we will give you a teaser of what you might expect. \nOur story is one that can only happen in Shiran and playing through this adventure will introduce players not only to the land of Shiran but also to its people. The adventure begins in Kulg, a city of contradictions standing firm against the elements on the edge of civilization, protecting its traditions, and preserving its future. Anomalous data readings collected by several factions in Kulg, bring the players together to investigate the source of the readings, and to report back on what they find. \nThe party must navigate their way through The Vastness and find the source of this strange data, so they appeal to a spiritual sect of weaseling Shangpa known as the Seekers of the Sacred Way. This troupe accompanies wayward travelers through The Vastness and strive to keep them safe through the land of ice, snow, and ravaging shard storms. Along the journey, the party has opportunities to meet many people who inhabit Northern Shiran and the reaches of The Vastness. They may find members of an Ancient Order of dwarves given the charge to protect the crystal caves which broach the planet\u2019s magical ley line network. They may happen upon a society of rabbit folk called the \u2018Jir\u2019 who inhabit the belly of giant megafauna that roam The Vastness. Their paths may cross an infamous group of drifter and dasher pilots known as the Frigid Flyers who rove The Vastness and claim it as their home. The adventurers must expect the unexpected while they seek causes to mysterious happenings in a region that few survive, and even fewer understand. What will happen, what will they find, and what does it all mean?\n\nWelcome to Scourge of Shiran.\nScourge of Shiran is an adventure written by The Game Academy, set in the World of Alessia, a 5e-compatible (and soon to be Starfinder) game setting published by Storm Bunny Studios. Scourge of Shiran is the published version of one of four summer adventures to be featured in The Game Academy's 2021 Adventure Gaming Summer Camp. The adventure is designed to be played over 5 to 6 four-hour game sessions with provided 3rd level characters and taking the characters through 5th level. \nThe final published adventure book will be 96 pages for our standard edition, and 120 pages for our special educator's edition, which will feature educational sidebars and call-outs for integrating the events in the adventure with real-world academic STEM subjects. Along with the educator's edition, we are also publishing an accompanying 96-page student workbook for student players to track their progress through the adventure, as well as record their reflections on the educational aspects of the game, and answers to related puzzles and exercises created to blend perfectly between the game and the classroom.\nAlong with our internal staff, and in partnership with Storm Bunny Studios, we are fortunate to include a cadre of RPG superstar writers and developers taking our project into the A-level game. Here's a peek at our epic team of heroes...\nWelcome to the Kickstarter for the Scourge of Shiran Adventure \u2013 an educationally themed space fantasy adventure set in the World of Alessia. Designed for the 5th edition of the world\u2019s most popular roleplaying game, this adventure takes player characters out into the Vastness, a dangerous northern wasteland where an alien threat slowly spreads\u2026\nSet exclusively in the World of Alessia Campaign Setting, this collaboration pairs The Game Academy\u2019s organizational goals with Storm Bunny Studio\u2019s vision for Alessia, creating an immersive adventure that teaches while entertaining.\nWhile all good adventures distract us, the Scourge of Shiran Adventure entertains while encouraging communication, collaborative problem-solving, and divergent thinking.\nThis adventure combines top-level writing from a host of industry RPG authors with educational pedagogy and social awareness, creating a tool that educators can use in an academic setting that encourages positive and constructive behavior.\nUsing classic themes adjusted for today\u2019s age, this adventure empowers the heroes to change their environment, the Vastness, and with it, the world.  \n\n Born from the combined vision of game designers Jere Manninen and Jaye Sonia, the World of Alessia is a futuristic utopia whose native y\u00f6kai mingle peacefully with dozens of alien species of which are carefully protected by the divinely crafted Rings of Heaven.\nWith all its advantages, Alessia remains a place filled with threats \u2013 both inside and out. While its Rings of Heaven keep outside invaders unable to penetrate the planet in force, smaller assaults remain a constant threat to the people below.\nAlessia is a rich setting that focuses on the heroic, mixing elements of Wuxia with science fiction to create an alternate, non-human centric campaign setting that encourages the heroic alongside the inquisitive.\nA Different Approach to Conflict Resolution\nAlthough the World of Alessia has many of the same problems of any modern society, the historical struggles of Alessia\u2019s proud y\u00f6kai and their alien allies have given rise to a truly wondrous future \u2013 a future worth defending.\nAlessia\u2019s cultural norms, especially in places like the Empire of Xian and the Free Cities of Shiran, encourage and practice de-escalation techniques whenever possible; in places where the Empire\u2019s Peacekeepers hold the front, this is doubly important.\nEvery encounter in the Scourge of Shiran Adventure has been carefully tailored to showcase the many non-violent solutions available to heroes while still giving the players opportunities to take action when necessary.  \nWorld of Alessia 5e Primer Version on SALE (334 pages)\nWe at The Game Academy (TGA) are a 501(c)3 educational non-profit organization committed to the social, emotional, and academic success of learners of all ages through the use of tabletop role-playing games and live-action role-play. We provide collaborative storytelling experiences that encourage academic and social/emotional skills in youth ages 8-18 and adults through our innovative enrichment classes, summer camps, and custom made curricula for educators.\nWhile we are based in the San Francisco Bay Area, we have been working with educators across the country to accomplish our mission since our inception in 2016. Our staff has worked in education and educational gaming since the early 2000s.  \n Storm Bunny Studios is a small, Wisconsin-based tabletop roleplaying game company that publishes several campaign settings, including the Rhune: Dawn of Twilight Campaign Setting, Mike Myler\u2019s Mists of Akuma, and the World of Alessia Campaign Setting, in which the Scourge of Shiran Adventure takes place.\nFounded in 2012 by author Jaye Sonia, Storm Bunny Studios has maintained an informal relationship with The Game Academy since 2016. They are excited to be officially teaming up to create some world-changing content.  \n\n\nThe Game Academy has served children and adults through their various programs since 2016, continuing the work that the founders Joshua Archer and Bert Holcomb were doing for at least 5 years previously under Iocari Games. In founding The Game Academy, Joshua and Bert adopted a new mandate to bring professional educational tabletop role-playing games to a wider audience, including the underrepresented, economically disadvantaged, and at-risk youth who would not afford the programs run under a for-profit model. TGA operates under the principle of never turning away a child from their programs due to economic hardship. At any given time, 30% or more of the participants are on a partial or full scholarship. \nWith their year-round Enrichment Gaming Program (EGP), Adventure Gaming Summer Camp (AGSC), Winter and Spring Break mini-camps, and their Game Master Training and Certification Program (GMTP), The Game Academy has served over two hundred individual children and adults during their four years of operation, with concurrent enrollment reaching over 100 students at its peak.\nThrough their various programs and offerings, The Game Academy has become a community of participants and their families that supports each member with a safe environment in which they place their trust and find belonging. Over a third of the programs' participants have some type of physical, emotional, or intellectual challenge, which the TGA staff are equipped and prepared to support through normalization and open communication. Every participant has an opportunity to find belonging and support, from which they can build confidence, trust, and deep relationships.\nThe Game Academy has also worked with school systems to create game-based learning units for the classroom. One engagement was a year-long adaptation of a high school Spanish class into a live-action role-play focusing on real-world skills and practices pertaining to life after high school. Another engagement was a ten-day middle school unit educating the class on the American Industrial Revolution. Both projects were well-received and increased motivation and engagement in the materials of the class.\nWhen our nation experienced the shutdown in March 2020, The Game Academy made a hard pivot from in-person classes to an entirely online delivery model within a matter of weeks. We were able to continue our programs with most of our students, and consequently able to retain most of our staff. Through this new model, TGA has been able to reach new populations that live in diverse and remote locations and provide gaming sessions for adults, which offer relief from social isolation and general anxiety experienced as a consequence of living through a pandemic.\nIn many cases, The Game Academy has shown resilience, resourcefulness, and flexibility that has allowed them to continue to serve their community's needs and thrive in times that have been less than ideal. TGA is adept at identifying advantages in times of hardship and strives to provide its community with top-quality educational and entertaining experiences. TGA views the collaboration with Storm Bunny Studios, through The World of Alessia, as a significant advantage in addressing the inequities and social stresses of our current age through the defense and development of a utopian society.  \n\nADD-ONS\nWe have a few add-ons available for those wishing to show further support to our project and to educators.\n$10 - Gift a PDF copy to a qualified educator.\nWe strive to get Scourge of Shiran into as many educators' hands as possible, and with your generosity, we can make this a reality. Pledge an extra $10 and we will give a PDF copy of the Scourge of Shiran to a qualified educator - of your choice, or our own.\n\n$25 - Get your very own  Master Tenzin Tee!\nShow your support for Scourge of Shiran by wearing this high-quality Tee with Master Tenzin\nWhile we will be releasing Scourge of Shiran in October 2021, show your support early by wearing this finely-crafted tee-shirt printed with Master Tenzin on the front. With Master Tenzin, you will never lose your way.\nThe Game Academy and Storm Bunny Studios view our collaboration on Scourge of Shiran as an opportunity to bring educational pedagogy and creative excellence together and produce a top-notch adventure that will be useful in the classroom as well as exciting to play for all.\nAs a non-profit, The Game Academy focuses on the combined good we can do through this project. Fortunately, Storm Bunny Studios shares our values and is excited to work with us on a series of adventures that bring together the industry's best talent and challenge assumptions, introduce scientific concepts, and educate in critical and divergent thinking. Scourge of Shiran serves as our first collaboration of many to come.\nPart of the good we are celebrating in our project is the bringing together of talented writers, designers, artists, and educational experts and collaborating with them on a project of value and principle. We are also committed to putting as much of the operating budget as we can afford into paying our contributors as well as we are capable.\nWe are also committed to providing Scourge of Shiran to educators at as close to production costs as possible. Our launch on Giving Tuesday is an opportunity for early bidders to secure a free copy of Scourge of Shiran to verified educators and moving beyond the launch, we are providing an educator package that will equip them with everything they need to run a successful campaign for their students at a fraction of the retail cost. Each contribution to our project includes an offset amount that pays to supply verified educators with our products for free or at cost.\nDeliverables\nScourge of Shiran (Standard and Educator\u2019s Editions)\n We aim to deliver Scourge of Shiran in October of 2021, avoiding the possibility of spoiling the adventure for the participants in The Game Academy\u2019s Adventure Gaming Summer Camp 2021. We are producing this 120-page adventure with a standard edition as well as an educator\u2019s edition. The educator\u2019s edition will add call-outs and references to educational standards met and individual educational units that tie into the story's plot.\nScourge of Shiran Players\u2019 Guide\nBefore this, however, we aim to produce and release a Scourge of Shiran Players\u2019 Guide, which will provide backers with an exciting preview of the things to come in the main adventure. The Scourge of Shiran Players\u2019 Guide will contain character backgrounds, example characters, extra art, new character classes and options, and details on factions found in Shiran.\nScourge of Shiran Student Workbook\nAlong with the release of the Educator\u2019s Edition of Scourge of Shiran, we will also be releasing a 96-page 7\u201d x 9\u201d Student Workbook. In this elegant workbook, students will:\nTrack their characters statistics, experience, and possessions,\nWrite their character\u2019s backstories and motivations.\nTrack their character\u2019s progress through the adventure,\nTake notes, observations, and reflections, and\nRecord answers to surrogate puzzles and academic word problems used in bridging the content of the adventure and related classwork.\n$20k - Racing The Wind\nOnce we reach the $20k mark, we will produce a 24-page 1st-level Adventure in Shiran - Racing The Wind, to be delivered to all backers at $20 or more as PDF, and for all backers of $40 and more as a softcover print. Racing the Wind features the beast riders of Shiran and introduces many of the factions and locations in the lands below the Vastness.\n$25k - Finding the Sacred Way\nOnce we reach the $25k mark, we will open the \u201cSeeker of the Sacred Way\u201d pledge level.

The Game Academy puts human value above all else and is happy to increase the rate for our talented and skillful writers and artists. \nTimes are difficult right now, and we\u2019re doing what we can to help creatives stay employed as creatives. In this way, we are doing our part to support the artists who feed our souls and who also are struggling to survive through the pandemic.\n$30k - Mastering the Vastness\nOnce we reach the $30k mark, we will launch the \u201cMaster of the Vastness\u201d pledge level. Backers at this level will receive all the perks of the \u2018Shadow Operative\u2019 pledge level and will also be enrolled in The Game Academy\u2019s complete Game Master Training and Certification program.

Our creative collaborators are professional writers and artists known for their skill and their reliability, some having worked for established companies such as Wizards of the Coast and Paizo for over twenty years. Additionally, because of our partnership, we will be starting this project with a large asset library which will reduce costs and expedite delivery.\n\nFurthermore, our parallel internal commitment to developing and releasing this adventure in time for our 2021 summer camp season guarantees that we are going to complete the story in plenty of time before we release in October 2021.

The story chronicles the lives of two sisters who, in a moment of peril, are transported to a magical world full of danger, magic and mystery. They soon find themselves embroiled in a conflict between several warring tribes and, with no route back home in sight, the sisters are left with a single choice: adapt to this new and bizarre world, or perish.\nTwo beautifully designed graphic novels totalling over 140 pages each - or 300 pages exactly in the hardback edition. A body of work created by artists and writers from five different continents. Above all, a comic book experience you won't find anywhere else. Don't take our word for it, you can read a free preview of Nani on our website right now (which you'll get as an instant PDF if you back the project at any level).\nNani takes place in \u2018Samma\u2019, a magical world inspired by West African myths and legends. Samma has been lovingly designed to showcase the beauty of African art and storytelling - everything from the outfits, character designs, magic systems, architecture, and even the humour, has been crafted to represent the best of West African culture.\nSamma is inhabited by various creatures and beings that group themselves into different tribes. The tribes can be roughly divided into two groups, the Chosen who serve as the ruling class, and the Fallen who are thought of as lesser beings.\nThe story is also full of metaphors that serve as a window into our own world. Mina and Lamin, our main characters, are constantly confronted with very real manifestations of their heritage as they explore the world of Samma. One of the first people they meet there is Laye, a woman who is everything the girls want to be \u2013 smart, strong, independent, and powerful... She\u2019s also the character most visually in-touch with African culture and tradition, the complete opposite of our otherwise highly modern protagonists. As the sisters begin their journey alongside Laye, they also begin to develop a new relationship with their heritage \u2013 and, thus, themselves.\nUltimately, this story is for anyone that loves fantasy and high concept narratives such as Avatar: The Last Airbender, Saga, or Lord of the Rings. However, Nani is also bringing something completely new to the table; now you get to experience fantasy through the unique lens of African mythology.\nMina is the primary protagonist of Nani. She\u2019s in her late teens and was born and raised in Nigeria. A couple of years before the start of the story, Mina was robbed at gunpoint by a group of armed thugs. Ever since then, she\u2019s struggled to overcome this trauma. As a lifelong Martial artist, Mina had always thought of herself as invincible. After she was robbed, she was not only forced to consider her own vulnerability but is now confronted with the psychological scars of the incident on an almost daily basis. As the events of Nani unfold, she now finds herself facing an even bigger challenge: she is trapped in a strange world full of supernatural creatures, magical warriors and mythical beings. The primary motivation behind Mina\u2019s character is whether she can overcome the trauma of her past in order to rise up to the challenges of the present.\n\nLamin is Mina's younger sister. Like Mina, she is a lifelong martial artist, especially skilled in the striking arts. Both she and Mina are perfectly capable of defending themselves, and Lamin isn\u2019t afraid to make this known. Although she's often brash and impulsive, Lamin is incredibly loyal and supportive - especially when it comes to her big sister. However, she also views Mina as her rival, and deep down she suppresses a complicated envy when it comes to her sister. As Mina grows over the course of the story, Lamin pursues her relentlessly, utterly determined not to be left behind.\n\nLaye is a high-ranking warrior from the world of Samma. From a young age, Laye had been identified as a warrior with enormous potential and, as a result, she didn't have much of a childhood. Despite an incredibly intense upbringing, training her to be a fierce warrior, Laye is a naturally kind-hearted person with a very idealistic sense of morality. This eventually causes her to question the very society she was raised to protect.\nKore is the leader of the Kura clan, a motley group of werehyenas living in exile, and the antagonist of the story. Decades prior to the events of Volume 1, the Kuras had rebelled against the ruler of Samma and were consequently exiled to a barren wasteland known as Tsari. No longer willing to accept a life of poverty and strife, Kore incites a rebellion in the hopes of restoring his clan to their former glory.\nNani is for anyone that loves fantasy or coming of age stories. You've probably seen plenty of fantasy stories inspired by both eastern and western folklore and mythology,  but we\u2019ll bet you haven\u2019t seen anything inspired by African mythology. Black Panther is great, but it's one of the only comics that showcases the majesty of African culture - and this needs to change. If that whets your appetite, then Nani is a great next step towards diving into African culture!\nThis campaign presents an opportunity for us to help promote and share African-inspired stories on a much larger scale than they typically receive - a scale that they absolutely deserve. Nani is an epic fantasy tale that fully showcases the magic of African storytelling, and one that goes deeper into our mythology than any mainstream comics have done before.\n\n\n\nBorn and raised in Lagos, Nigeria, Ziki is a writer and entrepreneur with a burning passion for storytelling. His first book, Iku, was featured as part of the original Kugali Anthology, and since then he's gone on to work on projects ranging all the way from comics to film and tv.\nZiki is also the Co-Founder of Kugali, which he started in order to showcase the best of African art and storytelling, and who will be helping to fulfil the rewards if the campaign is successful. Nani is the next step in this mission.\nJasonas is the chief designer and illustrator at Kugali. Having grown up in Zimbabwe, Jasonas discovered Japanese manga and anime and immediately fell in love. Ever since then, Jasonas has worked tirelessly to realise his dream of becoming an artist, and now his work speaks for itself. Over the course of his time with Kugali he has learned to incorporate various African art styles into his work, and works tirelessly to ensure that every visual representation of African culture within his work is as accurate and as well-informed as it can be. We couldn't be prouder of the result.\nNyasha is Kugali\u2019s Senior Editor and grew up between Zimbabwe and England. Inspired by how much she could learn about the world around her through fiction, Nyasha started writing at a young age. Her editorial journey began when she discovered the joys of helping people find their own literary voices. Nyasha\u2019s keen eye for detail has earned her a reputation at Kugali, where she\u2019s supporting writers in creating organic plots and authentic characters.\nCristina is a freelance illustrator from Caracas, Venezuela. She has long been influenced by Egyptian art and the works of Pablo Picasso, but also Venezuela's own African artistic influences with the Diablos de Yare tradition. Working alongside Kugali, she discovered her passion for comic book coloring and has increasingly incorporated more nuanced coloring styles into her work.\nBill Masuku is a Zimbabwean Nommo Award-Nominated comic book artist and author. He is the creator of the comic series Captain South Africa and the short Welcome to Dead World, both of which were shortlisted for the Nommo Award this year. He is also the author of the urban fantasy series Misfortunism, a set of novellas that depict mental health as a form of unstable supernatural forces. He works to contribute to creating authentic African stories told by Africans.\nApproximately 40% of the funds raised in our initial goal will go towards printing and production. Making comics is a time-intensive labour of love so we also want to make sure we take care of our creative team, hence why we are dedicating another 40% of the funds towards paying every member of the that group. The rest of the money raised will be used to cover Kickstarter fees and shipping and finally, we're giving ourselves a 5% contingency buffer in case any unforeseen problems emerge.\nVolume 1 is already complete and we've already begun production on Volume 2, so we're confident in our ability to complete this project within 4-5 months.\n\nNani is brought to you by Kugali, an arts collective working  to bring African art and storytelling to the forefront on an international scale. Our goal is to create stories that honour Africa's rich history of storytelling, showcase the contemporary African experience, and embrace Africa\u2019s future. Stories shape our society; let's shape our stories.

When I finally broke into freelance illustration, I wanted  to give back to the industry in a meaningful way.\nI've been asking creators what type of stock art is missing in the industry. The response has been overwhelmingly clear. This project is to fill those gaps for you.\nThis project will be a collection of 75 to 100 stock illustrations with a Modern, Sci-Fi, or Lovecraft theme. There will be a total of SEVEN categories of artwork:\nFONTS - ONE font for each of the Modern, Sci-Fi, and Lovecraft Themes.\nFULL PAGE / COVER ART - THREE vertical full page illustrations designed to also be usable as cover art. Each illustration will be divided into foreground, middle, and background images.\nVEHICLES - FIVE images of various modes of transportation. These will include up to 3 variants each with a minimum of 12 total variants.*\nSCENES - SEVEN half page illustrations of action or display of skill. Like the full page art, these will be broken into foreground, middle, and background images. Each image will include up to 3 variants with a minimum of 15 total variants.*\nEFFECTS - NINE images of various effects such as explosions, weather, gunshots, and more. These will be accompanied by an appropriate text effect such as: BOOM, ZAP, CRACK, etc.\nCHARACTERS - ELEVEN characters and creatures posed to be used in a scene. Each of these will include up to 3 variants with a minimum of 24 total characters or creatures.*\nITEMS - THIRTEEN illustrations of various items and equipment. These also will have up to 3 variants each with a minimum of 27 total variations.*\n*The actual number of variants per illustration will depend upon the complexity of converting the image to another genre.\nAs usual with most of my projects, illustrations will be chosen from submitted ideas. These ideas will be curated and voted upon to determine the actual contents of this project.\n$4,900 - Funding goal.\n$5,900 - COVERS will receive full color.\n$6,900 -  VEHICLES will receive full color.\n$7,900 - SCENES will receive full color.\n$8,900 - CHARACTERS will receive full color.\n$10K - ITEMS will receive full color.\n$10K+ - For every additional $500, backers get 10 images from my stock art catalog.\nNone of the illustrations on this page are part of this project.

It seems that everyone wants to come! BUT:\nNone of the Guests of Honor can 100% commit until we set the date which we cannot do until the virus clears up.\nKeeping that in mind we would like to announce our Featured Guest of Honor: \nNone of the Special Guests want to have to cancel once the date is set. Because of this we will announce special guests at a later date.\nArt Show\nWhen we think about games we picture the artwork! Art is a very important part of any game and we are ready to celebrate the artwork and the artists! Artists, like Guests of Honor, cannot 100% commit until we set the date which we cannot do until the virus clears up. \nWe will announce these special guests at a later date.\nExhibit Hall\nWe will do our best to bring great exhibitors featuring great products for sale. Great exhibitors who have RPG, Board Game, Cosplay, and LARP related products.\nIt can be hard to commit to an event when you don't know when it will be.

It helps us plan, helps us put a deposit down on the hall, and helps us get the Guests of Honor here.\nIt does NOT get you a badge.\nWe are not collecting badge money through the Kickstarter. Why?\nBecause we plan to use Tabletop Events to plan and organize PhoenixCon and it wouldn't be fair to cut them out.

The date will be set 4 to 10 weeks after the \"all clear announcement\"and will be between April and September. It will not be the same weekend as Gen Con or Origins.

At this point you can also submit games that you want to run.\nWe will open game registration shortly afterwards.\nAttendees will have the chance to sign up for games in the order listed below.\nConvention Schedule\nSubject to change. \nShipping\nSome of you will want to back the project for merch but won't be able to come to the event. That's okay! You will be able to pay for shipping (currently $4 USA $15 international) and we will ship your merch to you. This will be done later after the Kickstater project is done. \nMore Details\nFrom the creator of this project:\nI wish we had firm details! The date is the biggest one. Also, what events will there be? Who are the Guests of Honor? Can I get the Steak Wellington at the Royal Dinner?\nWe are working on getting these details set. \nPart of this we cannot control. The virus, the pandemic, these are things we cannot do anything about.\nPart of this we can control. Every pledge shows us another person who is interested. Bigger pledges show even more interest.\nEvery pledge shows interest which encourages the Guests of Honor and Exhibitors. \nMore Guests of Honor and Exhibitors encourages more people to make a pledge.\nWhich encourages us to bring in more...\nWell you see, it is a positive feedback loop.\nAnd it starts with you.\nThanks!\nAndy\n * The nature of this event is that many things are subject to change.\nSponsorship Opportunities available contact Andy Watkins andy@cosmo-joe.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis project presents some special challenges; mostly the fact that we don't know exactly WHEN it will be.

Those final decades were associated with rampant growth, progress, and innovations culminating in the World\u2019s Exposition of 1893. Yet Chicago\u2019s emergence to prominence was not without tragedy. The Great Chicago Fire of 1871 nearly reduced the city to embers. Riots and strikes broke out. And there was the World's Exposition.\nThe bustle of the World\u2019s Expo hid an appalling snake in the grass, Mr. Herman Webster Mudgett, aka Dr Henry Howard Holmes. Holmes would become infamous as America\u2019s first serial killer and proprietor of The Murder Castle. He confessed to 27 murders, and was purported to have killed as many as 200 victims before his capture. Some believed he may have been Jack the Ripper. Others knew him as a devil.\nWithin this Kickstarter you\u2019ll find two books: The Devil\u2019s City, a novella, and Horror in the Windy City, a full-length RPG campaign sourcebook expanding the Whispers in the Dark RPG universe. Whispers in the Dark is compatible with the 5th edition of the world's oldest rpg and set in a world adjacent to our own. The books can be enjoyed independently, but when conjoined they offer the players, readers, and game masters a truly immersive experience.\nThe Devil's City cover by Thomas Boatwright\nThe Devil's City is an illustrated, hardcover, limited edition novella by Sara Tantlinger and Matt Corley. Within its 90 pages the book follows H.H. Holmes as he stalks and captures five victims through chaos and confusion of the 1893 World's Exposition. Each chapter begins with a diary entry from the devil himself, and contains evocative illustrations to bring the chapter to life.\n\u201cThe Devil\u2019s City is a helluva thrill ride, delving deep into the sick history of serial killer HH Holmes, brutally peeling back the layers of his evil legacy through a series of surprising character studies, viciously unraveling Holmes' evil blood lust, victim after victim, until it reveals an unexpected core lurking behind it all. Holmes experts Sara Tantlinger and Matt Corley have built a whole new underworld around the killer's infamous Murder Castle at turn of the century Chicago, and this book takes you straight down into the twisted intricacies its darkest abyss. LOVED IT.\u201d\n                                      - Michael Arnzen, Bram Stoker Award-winning author of Play Dead\n\"In The Devil's City, Sara Tantlinger & Matt Corley have created a phantasmagoric fun house of a novel, heavy on the gore. The novella takes the story of H.H. Holmes and gives it an even darker twist. A suspenseful, highly recommended read.\"\n                   - John F.D. Taff, Multiple Bram Stoker Award Nominee, author of The Fearing.\nThe book is illustrated by Daniele Serra, Francois Vaillancourt, Sam Araya, and others. To bring the reader further into the Holmes' lair, an appendix of exquisitely detailed hand drawn maps of the World's Fair Hotel by Dark Realm Maps was added. Below is one of the four maps.\nCheck out our 5-star review at Let's Get Galactic, and our 4-star review at High Fever Books.\nH.H. Holmes Murder Castle Ground Floor - by Dark Realm Maps\nHorror in the Windy City cover by Kealan Patrick Burke\nHorror in the Windy City  brings the excitement, intrigue, and beautiful chaos of the time period to your table using the 5e rules you already know as adapted by the acclaimed Whispers in the Dark RPG written and developed by Matt Corley and M.T. Black.\nThe beautifully illustrated 180+ page book is a fully realized campaign sourcebook covering Chicago in the latter half of the 19th century. There are new rules, backgrounds, a new alignment system, NPCs, scenarios, and more. In short, it\u2019s everything you\u2019ll need to take your party of investigators to Chicago. It will be up to them to find their way out.\nExtensive Worldbuilding. Horror in the Windy City is written to provide the GM with everything needed to play multiple campaigns in its borders.\nThe major events, and the forces behind them, are explored with scenario hooks and evocative details for the GM present to their players.\nChicago\u2019s historic neighborhoods and locations: Englewood, Lake Forest, St Charles, The Cabbage Path, the Stockyards, Wrigley Field, Lake Michigan, and others are presented with scenario hooks, and NPCs of note.\nThe Dreamlands' incursion into Chicago has had profound effects on the city. Particularly in areas of heightened emotions, tension, and violence. Find out what\u2019s happened, and continues to happen, behind the veil of sleep.\nNo story of Chicago is complete without an in-depth look at the public clubs, secret cabals, gangs, and gangsters running the city. From the public faces, to the puppeteers pulling the strings, dozens of new NPCs and organizations are detailed.\nAll Original Content\nNew Mechanics. Horror in the Windy City introduces new mechanics for players and GMs to use immediately in any Whispers campaign.\nA new ancestry \u2013 The exotic Tcho-Tcho.\nNew backgrounds \u2013 Athlete, Explorer, Laborer, Religious Scholar, and Teamster\nNew feats \u2013 Hardened Mitts, Inner Calm, Nimble Counterpuncher, Resilient Psyche, Steady Heads, Vril Initiate, and others.\nA new Alignment system that introduces personality nuances based on the following pillars: Good vs Evil, Order vs Chaos, and Selfless vs Selfish. The personality of your PC may change during your campaign, and this system takes that into account. \nThe Dagger by Francois Vaillancort\nScenario Hooks, NPCs, and Horrors in the Darkness. Horror in the Windy City includes the GM tools, statblocks, and information needed for a GM to create their own campaigns. \nNovella WIP by Francois Vaillancourt\n The World Fair Hotel. All four floors are exquisitely drawn by ENnie nominated cartographer Dark Realm Maps. Each of the nearly 100 hundred rooms is described in detail for easy use by the GM. Body chutes, walk-in vaults, gas rooms, and a basement laboratory are just some of the rooms you and your players will discover.\n Beneath the Veil and Castle Under Siege. This campaign begins where the novella leaves off with the players assuming the roles of Holmes\u2019 victims as they awaken in the lowest level of the Murder Castle. The players are also able to take the role of investigators and concerns citizens infiltrating the villain\u2019s lair to rescue victims. One location, and two uniquely complimentary objectives. Total playing time: 6-8 sessions\n Other scenarios. Joining the campaign will be shorter, loosely connected scenarios suitable for play as one-shots, as components of a longer Chicago-based story arc, or to adapt for your own table.\n NPCs from History. In addition to the five pre-gens (the characters from the novella), HH Holmes, Benjamin Pitezel, Charles Chappell, Catherine O\u2019Leary, Daniel Burnham, Harry Houdini, Buffalo Bill, Frederick Douglas, Annie Oakley, and other notables will have full statblocks.\n Faces in the Crowd. Pinkertons, workers, chefs, beggers, soldiers, cowboys, Amerinds, and many, many more will have statblocks to give the GM plenty of choices and options in their own scenarios.\nPledge Levels\nHidden Cultists by Dan Hawksworth\nTiers with printed copies of The Devil's City are only available for US Backers.

Instead of providing you a list of what I\u2019ll be adding for each milestone I\u2019m going to tell you how the extra dollars raised over the $12,000 funding goal will be spent in broader terms.\n Art. For each $1,000 raised I will be adding 1-3 piece(s) of art (the quantity depends on the size of the piece and the artist). Dani, Francois, Sam, Benjamin, Dan, Matt R, Toby, and Thomas are all on standby to add illustrations.\n Profit-sharing and Royalties. All the writers have either royalties or profit-sharing as part of their contracts. The more funds raised the more they are paid. It\u2019s pretty straightforward.\n Planning for the Future. If the project does very well, and we all hope it does, funds beyond the goal will be used by SMS for two main purposes. The first is to continue to pay creators before crowdfunding so that our books are on time and to spec. I have another novella, a novel, two RPG books, and The Crow Man sequels to publish in the next 12 month. The success of this KS will have a dramatic effect on those timelines. Secondly, SMS would like to expand distribution beyond POD, and for that physical inventory is necessary. And it\u2019s not cheap \ud83d\ude0a\nThe Writers\nMatt Corley whose works writing and publishing include Lamp\u2019s Light Sanitarium, Whispers in the Dark, and Harper\u2019s Tale.

In PunkApocalyptic: The Roleplaying Game, based on the wild and irreverent miniatures game of the same name by Bad Roll Games, you and your friends assume the roles of mercenaries who roam the Wasteland. In this bleak and radioactive land, you fight to survive, explore the ruins of what came before, and trade blood, sweat, and tears for the precious bullets that have become the land's currency. Explore the radioactive ruins, fight battle-crazed mutants, negotiate with bizarre cultists, bargain with junkers and scavengers, and unearth fantastic relics from the past. Brutal and filthy, PunkApocalyptic: The RPG offers thrilling adventures steeped in the carnage of a bleak and devastated future.    \n\n As a huge thank you to everyone who has supported so far, all backers of Scavenger and higher get FOUR bonus missions!     \nArt by Matteo Spirito\nPunkApocalyptic: The RPG uses a variant of the Demon Lord Engine, introduced first in the horror-fantasy roleplaying game, Shadow of the Demon Lord. Designed for a short-burst campaign of eleven adventures, with flexible character development, and no-nonsense, streamlined rules, you can bang out a character in no time and get down to the business of kicking ass.\nYou start the game as a fragile survivor, choosing from a list of eight backgrounds such as Muscle or Face. Once you complete your first mission, you assemble a team, and choose a novice path to guide your character's development. Novice paths include the mutated freaks, killers, and scum. The more missions you complete, the more choices you make, picking up an expert path and eventually a master path.\nPunkApocalyptic: The RPG includes some variations on the Demon Lord Engine, such as using eight attributes instead of four, with Grit as a healing resource, along with a few other changes. If you know how to play Shadow of the Demon Lord, you'll have no trouble playing this game. And if you don't yet know Shadow of the Demon Lord, well, it's easy, using familiar dice rolling conventions to make it easier for folks familiar with some of the other well-known roleplaying games currently being played today. \nArt by Matteo Spirito; This could be you!\nWant to learn more?

It was incredibly popular, with nearly 2,500 backers. Now we're bringing you the sequel: nine new player classes in A TOUCH MORE CLASS, a 100-page full color book! \nYou can get either or both books from this Kickstarter, plus a unique set of cards for use with the cardcaster class in the original book.\n A TOUCH OF CLASS (REVISED): The original book has been revised and updated, and includes the alchemist, cardcaster, diabolist, feywalker, morph, noble, and occultist.\n A TOUCH MORE CLASS: This new book contains the bloodweaver, fatebender, gemini, geomancer, gunfighter, lodestar, monster tamer, savant,  and tinkerer.\nPlay as the brilliant savant, the black-powder gunfighter, or travel with exotic animal companions as the monster tamer! Harness the power of your environment as the geomancer, or create wondrous inventions as the tinkerer!\nAs with all of our Kickstarters, the books are ready. You'll get the PDFs within minutes of the Kickstarter campaign ending, and we'll commission the print run for the actual books the moment the Kickstarter funds clear! You won't have to wait for your rewards! \nThese new classes are fully detailed with exciting class-themed abilities! Each of these classes also contains a range of subclasses to further customize them. In this book you'll find the bloodweaver, fatebender, gemini, geomancer, gunfighter, lodestar, monster tamer, savant, and tinkerer.\nWant to read more? Find out more over on our website, download this free 12-page preview of the savant from DriveThruRPG, or this preview of the geomancer! \nThese nine classes originally appeared in EN5ider, the 5th Edition patreon. Since their publication we've revised and updated each of them after plenty of feedback from the community, and now they're ready to be presented in a beautiful full-color softcover book! Each is a full class along with subclasses and all the roleplaying information you'll need to play them at the table. \n Bloodweaver: Macabre Magician. Bloodweavers fuel their magical powers with their own blood, enhancing their own prowess, healing or bolstering allies, and flaying open their foes. They can sense the presence of creatures of flesh and bone, resist the cold reach of death, and manipulate a target\u2019s blood to spectacular, deadly effect. Choose from the Bloodbinder, Crimson Witch, and Scarlet Reaper subclasses!\n Fatebender: Destiny\u2019s Chosen. At the extreme edges of fate\u2019s tapestry, fatebenders pull upon its fraying threads, tugging at the strands of chance. Fatebenders manipulate their own dice rolls as well as those of allies and enemies, further relying on luck to make uncanny discoveries, avoid lethal attacks, and make the most of their own strikes. Subclasses include the Mascot, Jinx, and Weaver!\n Gemini: Two\u2010Faced Warrior. Evading and confounding enemies, gemini create dangerous semi\u2010real multiples of themselves and copy their foes\u2019 techniques. Their duality affects more than how they wage war however, and each embodies two major contrasting ideals, never certain which will be at the fore the next time they wake. Will you select the Atavist, the Equalist, or the Reluctant Hero?\n Geomancer: Nature\u2019s Hearthmage. These mages turn the surrounding elements into potent weapons and tools and fuel their spells with the primal components of creation. Geomancers can also protect companions from harm and draw upon nature outside of battle to reveal reality\u2019s secrets. Four distinct orders\u2014the Conqueror, the Apothecary, the Architect, and the Rune Knight.\n Gunfighter: Black Powder Desperado. These warriors shoot their way across the field of battle, pausing only long enough to aim their next bullets. Gunfighters are adept with the guns they choose to master, picking off targets hidden behind cover with precise shooting and aiming telling shots that leave enemies with catastrophic wounds. The Bushwacker, Drifter, and Maverick make your choice of subclasses!\n Lodestar: Fractured Soul Given Form. In combat lodestars are poetry in motion, their innate powers bringing both wonder and woe. To keep from unraveling into madness these fractured souls must train and hone their skills, becoming masters of body and mind\u2014and their lodestones, magical spheres used to attack, defend, and more. The lodestar chooses from three methods: Control, Imagination, or Instinct.\n Monster Tamer: Companion of Beasts. Monster tamers bond with monstrous pets, whether beasts, exotic aberrations, slimes, or even draconic in nature! Though significantly weaker on their own, tamers with companions make for a potent and unique addition to any group of adventurers able to tolerate the presence of a monster in their midst. Select from the Animalist regimen, Monstrous regimen, and Oddball regimen.\n Savant: Mind Over Matter. Sometimes saving the day means weaponizing knowledge. Savants are brilliant detectives, iconic martial artists, and adventurous physicians, each utilizing genius where others rely on magic or brute power. Repositories of lore, savants also use canny combat tricks to put enemies at a disadvantage. You might be an Adversary, a Chirurgeon, or a Coordinator.\n Tinkerer: Engineer of Wonder. Tinkerers bring life to impressive contraptions, create incredible devices, and forge legendary destinies! When not making or improving mundane items, tinkerers use their technical genius to unleash elemental fury upon their foes, relying upon their own brilliance to resist any magic that might subvert their will. Steam Knights, Bombardiers, and Mechanics make up the tinkerer's choice of subclasses!\nAnd if that's not enough, for those who don't already have A TOUCH OF CLASS, we have a revised edition of that book containing the alchemist, cardcaster, diabolist, feywalker, morph, noble, and occultist classes!  \nEach class has been tweaked and updated. \nThe cardcaster has been restructured to be more approachable.\nNew archetypes for the occultist and noble.\nExtra flavor and guides for making adventurers. \n Alchemist: Scientific Sorcery. The alchemist uses an almost scientific approach to magic to make alchemical discoveries. Will your alchemist become immune to poison, or discover the Elixir of Life? Will you delve into the Science of Creation and build a homunculus, or research the Science of Destruction and devise explosives? We also expand on the alchemist class with three new advanced studies: the Science of Illumination, the Science of Mutation, and the Science of Regeneration. Also included are two new spells, and an update which gives the alchemist a little more \u201coomph.\u201d\n Cardcaster: Seers of Fate. The cardcaster uses a tarot deck to release magic, playing cards to cast spells\u2014although she doesn\u2019t always have control over what spells are currently made available to her by the winds of fate! Also included are three subclasses: the Knight of Swords, which embodies mental force and determination; the Page of Wands, which embodies the magical power of creation; and the Queen of Cups, with embodies the emotions. This class is also supported by new feats and new secrets, including the King of Pentacles, which pertains to thrift and wealth; and the Jack of Beasts, which unleashes the trapped spirits of monsters. \n Diabolist: Students of Darkness. Diabolists deal with forbidden secrets and dark entities, grasping for power through dark pacts. While they have things in common with necromancers and warlocks, diabolists are something entirely more\u2026diabolical! Also included are two dark paths: the Demonic path and the Devilish path. We also introduce some conjured horrors, such as the accuser devil, contract devil, and more! \n Feywalker: A Taste of Primal Chaos. The feywalker is a mysterious warrior with mystical powers. Feywalkers can teleport short distances, breathe in air and water, and enchant others with a glance. They can also choose from three primal spheres: Beasts, Plants, or Entropy. \n Morph: Changing Faces. The morph is a shapechanging specialist, able to slide between different forms. Morphs have a choice of three essences\u2014the Doppleganger, the Primordial Beast, and the Trickster\u2014and a selection of Morph Talents they can choose from and acquire. \n Noble: Chessmaster and Commander. Leader, tactician, and a source of inspiration, the full 20-level noble class is able to command and inspire through three paths: the Path of the Heart, the Path of the Brave, and the Path of the Tactician.\n Occultist: Freeing the Monster Within. The occultist allows you to play a monster, with a choice of three distinct paths: Abomination, Vampire, or Werecreature! Delve into the dark and secret creatures of the night, cursed to exist as monstrous beings shunned by the world. \nA TOUCH OF CLASS got 4.7 out of 5 stars from customers in its initial print run on Amazon!\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 \"Brand new, original and fully developed classes that will make the other players at your table jealous.

This allows us to charge actual shipping costs just before we're ready to ship out rewards. For this reason...\nShipping costs are not included in your pledges for this campaign. You will be charged for shipping later, once rewards are ready to ship.\nThe above amounts INCLUDE S&H + VAT.\nFor example: If you live in Toronto and back at the Grimmerspace Core Tier, it should cost you $40.00 for your pledge + $12.17 for fulfillment = $52.17 (total cost).\nWe will ship all pledges from warehouses in Australia, Canada, Germany and the United States.\nUnfortunately, there is no easy way for us to collect or pay VAT for pledges made outside the countries / regions in the above list. If you do not live in one of those locations, you will be responsible for those fees when the product gets to you \u2013 most likely, having to pay them at the post office, if at all.\nRewards bound for these countries will not incur extra customs charges!\nStarfinder and associated marks and logos are trademarks of Paizo Inc., and are used under license.

As ENnie Award-winning freelancers and podcasters, we've written, authored, or edited over 2 million words for the roleplaying game industry and bring over 30 years combined industry experience to the table. Not to mention that separately, both Rone and I have launched and run successful businesses outside our gaming careers. And we've also consulted on or outright rescued struggling projects through Kickstarter; for example, forming business partnerships and then rolling up our sleeves to make sure the ENnie Award-winning Razor Coast and its related books finally got to Backers. \n\nWhile there is always risk starting a new company, we think the risks are minimal given our extensive business experience both in and outside the tabletop industry. However no one is an island, so Iron GM Games has signed agreements with Modiphius Entertainment and Gamerati, two companies with proven track records planning, executing, and delivering TTRPG Kickstarters. We believe their extensive, hands-on expertise, plus our other industry relationships, further mitigate these risks.\n\nWhile much of the design and development on Grimmerspace is complete and nearly half the art already purchased, it proved impossible to finish before the Kickstarter. Mostly because, until the Kickstarter completes, we won\u2019t know all the locations you want in the Grimmerspace books. And because every location in Grimmerspace gets an adventure, that means we just won't have a full list of adventures to write until after this Kickstarter. \n\nNonetheless, to ensure the highest quality work and swiftest delivery, we\u2019ve invited only top industry professionals with a history of meeting or exceeding deadlines to join our writing team. Of course, it is always possible for life to prevent a given designer from meeting obligations. Should that happen, we will tap our network and swiftly select a different writer to take over. With over nine top designers signed to the project and nearly a dozen equally proven people \u201con the bench,\" we are confident that our schedule is reasonable, achievable, and that we can minimize any delays that may arise.\n\nLast but not least: In recent months political factors, such as Brexit in the UK and a growing trade war with China, introduced increasing uncertainty into the publishing and tabletop games industries. To mitigate the cost and production risks posed by volatile markets we have already sourced additional solutions with printers and manufacturers in the United States, Lithuania, and Korea.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Digital Space", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nPDF copies of all Grimmerspace books\nAll Digital Rewards", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2020"}], "stat": ["1,024 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "The Endless Mall", "descp": "RETAILERS ONLY: Your rewards will be shipped before any product is offered to distributors.

Perched on his massive throne, the Sea King dreams of his massive jaws bathing in runnels of fresh land-dweller blood. He dreams of the ecstasy of rending air-breather flesh. His hate-filled dreams suffuse him with visions of presiding over a glorious and bloody feast where his despised enemies, those both above and below the waves, drown in a tide of their own blood, torn apart by his fierce warriors. In this sprawling adventure the characters will come face to face with this terrible menace.\nSea King\u2019s Malice is a full color and lavishly illustrated 5e adventure for the world\u2019s most popular role-playing game that takes characters on a sweeping adventure across the ocean, to previously uncharted lands, and finally down under the waves to the very depths of the sea. It is also available for the 0E Swords & Wizardry system for those preferring old-school rulesets.\nOn the East Coast of the Crescent Sea sits the vital city of Bridgeport, where the merchant company of Zephyr Assimilated has mysteriously lost a ship. Not just any ship, either, but  their flagship, a well-outfitted, well-provisioned merchant vessel with a veteran captain \u2014 who also happens to be the eldest child of Zephyr Assimilated\u2019s owner, Jaxon Brand.\nBrand is now assembling an expedition to search for and rescue the lost ship... \nOnly the most stalwart and bravest of heroes will have any chance of surviving the hazards of the open sea and the perils of other strange and yet unknown lands, both above and below the waves, as they search for clues surrounding the disappearance of the missing ship.  For in the sea-green depths a brooding menace awaits them, filled with  inhuman hatred of all things of the surface world. The adventurers\u2019 journey will end, one way or the other, in the Court of the terrifying Sea King. This edge-of-your seat 5e adventure takes characters to level 10, and is also available for Swords & Wizardry (0e) The Swords & Wizardry version will begin at higher level and cover fewer level advancements.\n\n Do you have the courage, fortitude, and lack of self-preservation to challenge the terror of the seas \u2013 the terrible and brooding menace of the Sea King? Surely only the foolhardy or the truly desperate would actually seek out this horror in the abyssal depths and confront him in his court, his very seat of power!  For the sea is an unforgiving place, the natural realm of the Sea King, and the characters are merely intruders in his realm. And yet \u2026 perhaps they will turn out to be very deadly intruders indeed\u2026 \n\nThe Treasure from Beadle & Grimm's Pandemonium Warehouse.\nFrog God Games is very proud to announce our partnership with Beadle & Grimm\u2019s Pandemonium Warehouse. They are the premier creator of high-end tools for tabletop game masters and players worldwide. The Map Vault: Sea King's Malice is the first of a planned series of limited edition maps for gamers everywhere.\nDear friends,\nAs grizzled veterans of the original AD&D, Alex\u2019s tale of the Sea King really spoke to us here at Beadle & Grimm\u2019s. The rules may be 5th Edition, but the vibe is old school in the best possible way \u2013 it strikes the perfect balance between heady role-playing, tense dungeon-crawling  and visceral, gory combat. We\u2019ve been looking for an opportunity to try something new, so we\u2019re very grateful to Alex and Frog God for inviting us to create a special enhancement for the Sea King\u2019s Malice adventure \u2013 our first-ever selection from the B&G Map Vault.\n\nThe Sea King\u2019s Edition of the Map Vault focuses on one of the most exciting and unique elements of Alex\u2019s story \u2013 the sailing ships. Three different ships are presented here, each on its own two-sided 24x30 map with art created exclusively for Beadle & Grimm\u2019s. One side has the full-color detail of a ship from the adventure, while the other has blank interiors and a dry erase surface so that you, the Dungeon Master, can use it to create future adventures from your own imagination. All six battle maps are scaled and gridded for your minis, and they come rolled in a custom cartographer\u2019s tube to keep them protected for years of future use.\nPrototype of the Map Vault: Sea King's Malice Cartographer's case.\nBeadle & Grimm\u2019s Pandemonium Warehouse was founded in 2018 by five old friends with more decades of gaming between them than they\u2019d like to admit. Our first two products, the Platinum Edition of Waterdeep: Dragon Heist and the Sinister Silver Edition of Ghosts of Saltmarsh, have established us as a premier creator of high-end tools for Dungeon Masters. Now with our new Map Vault, we get to reach out to the vibrant extended community of 5th Edition gamers.\nOne last thing \u2013 like our Platinum boxes, the Sea King\u2019s maps are a limited edition only \u2013 once they\u2019re sold out, they\u2019re gone forever. So jump on board!\nAnchors aweigh!\nSet sail!\n(Seriously, we can keep this up all day. Don\u2019t tempt us.)\nSincerely,\nBill, Charlie, Jon, Matt and Paul\nThese items may be added to any pledge in any quantity.

First of all: All shipping costs are included with this pledge level.The Temple of the Shark God Pledge gets you an invite you to join the Froggies at North Texas RPG Con 2020 in June or at Gamehole Con in November 2019 (your choice of 1). At this event, we will pay for your:\nConvention badge \nHotel room \nMeals and beverages\nAll you pay is your transportation to and from the convention! Shipping is also FREE, anywhere in the world! This is where you get to hang out with us behind the scenes, eat dinners with us, play in our games during the day, and generally stay up late without your parents telling you that it's bedtime. Ask any of our fans that have bought this pledge before, it\u2019s truly a wonderful experience! This reward also includes automatic entry into a game game run by Alex Kammer at North Texas RPG Con or at Gamehole Con in 2019 or 2020! Plus a VIP invitation to Bill Webb's Tegel Manor Halloween Game at Gamehole Con (2019 Only)!\nBook Quality\nAll Frog God Games hardcovers are stitched into 16-page packets, the packets are sewn together, and then all the packets are sewn to a cloth backing, creating a book block that is glued to its cover. This is what we mean when we say \"library binding.\"  That being said, after a myriad of book-binding issues both recently and dating back to 2nd Edition, there is nothing we hate to see more than someone investing in an expensive game book and having it fall apart on them after only a short period of regular use.  After all, you guys spend a lot of money on your books! Second, if a Frog God hardcover book ever falls apart (we have tested this with baseball bats and very rough use, by the way), we will replace it at no cost assuming we still have one in stock. Yes, that means if you call me in ten years, and your book binding has failed you (failed us really) through regular use (please no bulldozer roll overs), just email me and if the book is still in stock, we will mail you a new copy for free. Nothing I can do for you if they are all sold out though (but email me anyway and I'll hook you up in some way).  PLEASE NOTE! The POD option for this books is a softcover book and is NOT library bound. That being said, it is significantly less expensive to ship if you live in the UK, EU or Australia.\nBackerKit\nBackerkit enables us to get you the rewards you want both faster and more reliably than we could otherwise. No reward is eligible for shipment without Backerkit checkout. You will be asked to create a Backerkit account to select your reward. This process verifies both reward selection and your correct shipping address. PLEASE complete the Backerkit process in a timely fashion so we can deliver your pledge reward! \nDigital Reward Shipping\nWe will email the instructions to groups of eligible backers with instructions on how to access PDF pledge rewards. This is a three-step process that is completed using our web store. You will have to create a customer account on the Frog God Games website to get your PDF; it's how we keep track of everything. The Kickstarter PDF files are 'purchased' at zero cost by backers (as they are paid for after the Kickstarter) at the Frog God Games web store using a coupon code. That code will be sent via email to backers or will be provided through BackerKit. This process gets you your correct reward, ensures your future access to your reward files, and allows us to track project fulfillment. If you are missing something from your account, and see all over Facebook that everyone else has it, please email Mike at mike@froggodgames.com, and he will set things right for you. Be patient for a few days after it is first released though, as we do release these in batches to prevent crashing our server.\nPhysical Reward Shipping\nWhen the BackerKit site for this project is ready, you will receive an email. This is a separate communication than the Kickstarter survey. In that email you will receive the link to the site where you will be asked to verify your shipping information, your pledge rewards, and checkout through their system. Your Kickstarter pledge amount does not include shipping. It is during BackerKit checkout that your shipping cost is calculated and charged.\nShipping Damage or other Related Issues\nNo matter what we do, the post office seems to have a desire to drop, kick, throw or even drive over some packages with trucks (yes, it has happened). In the unlikely event that you are one of the lucky folks that have this happen to you, we will of course send you a new book. All you need to do is send photos of the damage in an email to Mike at mike@froggodgames.com. He will set you up with a new book. Please do not send multiple emails to multiple sources as it confuses the process and may cause delay. That being said, we have a 100% delivery promise on our books. You are the reason we are able to make cool products, and your satisfaction matters to us.\nRefunds\nIf for some reason you need a refund post-Kickstarter, we are happy to oblige, less a 13% charge that we pay to Kickstarter, Backerkit and Paypal. \nOverseas Shipping\nThis hardcover book likely will cost around $60 to $80 to ship to non-US customers. We continue to see cost increases and damage increases on overseas shipping. We cannot do anything about this. Likewise, some countries charge VAT tax or other fees to our customers on receipt. We cannot fraudulently lie about the value of materials we mail out.We actually have considered not even selling books overseas due to the complaints about postage. That being said, we have a number of long term customers that we want to be able to get our stuff. But this postage stuff is not for the faint of heart. Due to the handling of our products when we mail them tens of thousands of miles, we have noted a significant increase in damage as well. One package sent overseas can cost $50, $70 or even $100 to reship. We discussed this internally, after spending several thousand dollars in excess postage over the past year. While we take great care in packing, we still have about 2% of our shipments get damaged en-route. What we decided was that we would start double boxing overseas shipments, and also that we needed to charge insurance costs on the postal service. We will continue to honor our policy of 100% resend on damaged books--and after much deliberation, we will be adding a $15 USD insurance and handling charge on all overseas shipments. T We hate to do this--but conditions have simply become untenable for us to continue to lose large amounts of money shipping books overseas. We are happy to ship you anything regardless of where you live, but we have to stay in business at the same time.

That's all it takes to go down into the lands of endless darkness.\nThis project delivers a full 5th Edition campaign of dark fantasy adventure. It begins with undead plagues upon the surface, and then sends the heroes into the Underworld. Into the hungering dark. \nAllied with vampires, the darakhul of the Ghoul Imperium turn their attention to the surface. Emperor Nicoforus the Pale remains wary of further expansion, but others are not satisfied with  caution. These ghouls have set plans in motion to gain further control of the surface world and spread their dark religion across the land. \nThis project delivers a full adventure from levels 1 to 13 that begins with stirrings of ghoul trouble in Zobeck and eventually sends heroes into the Underworld to confront the leaders of the ghoul uprising. And it doesn't stint on the dangers of the Underworld: purple worms, bone collectives, kobold tinkers, otyughs, the derro and their strange madness, and, of course, the ghouls with their baronies and armies, implacable and alien and utterly without pity. \nThe Empire of the Ghouls for 5th Edition Kickstarter offers three main elements: \n1) the Empire of the Ghouls adventure campaign hardcover for the GM, a continuous storyline for an epic adventure from levels 1 to 13, that also includes new undead magic, a detailed tour of the Ghoul Empire, new monsters, and unforgettable villains.\n2) an Underworld Player's Guide softcover book of new player options, including new underworld races, new subclasses and tools, backgrounds, and undead-themed spells.\n3) a set of additional encounters, the Underworld Lairs. These standalone, single-map adventures are similar to Eldritch Lairs or Creature Codex Lairs. This book will contain between 5 and 12 such encounters, depending on stretch goals.\nTogether with some book-expanding stretch goals, this project provides new cavernous, dark lairs, character options, and a full campaign to draw adventurers against the dark gods and their minion. Here's an easy reference for all the pledges and rewards.\nThe core print books (Empire hardcover, Underworld Player's Guide softcover, and the Underworld Lairs softcover) will all be offered as add-ons for those who want more than one copy. \nWhile we always like to throw in one or two other add-ons of interest, offering a larger number of items makes it difficult or impossible to deliver EU-friendly and Canadian-friendly shipping. So we're going to keep it simple. \nAdditional add-ons may be announced over the course of the project; all add-ons will be available to backers during the Survey phase of the project (so you need not pay for them as part of your initial pledge).\nA large and proven creative team has been working on this project since early 2018. The designers on this project include lead designer Richard Green plus contributing designers Chris Lockey, Dan Dillon, Jeff Lee, Jon Sawatsky, Kelly Pawlik, Mike Welham, and Wolfgang Baur. The project editor is Meagan Maricle.\nNaturally, the look matters as well. The Kobold Press art director is Marc Radle, and our lead cartographer is Jon Pintar. Our cover artist is Craig J Spearing, and the video also features art by Bryan Syme, Egil Thompson, Roberto Pitturru, and William O'Brien. \nWe have early stretch goals commissioned by Darrin Drader, Richard Green, Jeff Lee, Jon Sawatsky, Wolfgang Baur, and Kelly Pawlik. (If a particular stretch goal is not funded, it may be published separately.)\nThis project builds on earlier Ghoul Imperium work by Wolfgang Baur, Scott Gable, and others.\nShipping costs from the US to anywhere outside North America have risen sharply in recent years, so we are once again partnering with groups in Canada and the EU. Kobold Press will pay customs and import duties for those packages, but they will take additional time to ship as they enter the mail system after an additional journey. \nOur best guess for those Canada-friendly and EU-friendly costs right now are roughly $24 shipping for Canada and roughly $34 for shipping to the EU. The UK, Norway, Switzerland, and Russia should expect shipping costs of approximately $50. We do not have an Australia estimate yet but anticipate shipping costs of $70 or more; we will not be working with a local partner due to the relatively low volume.\nTo calculate shipping to your location from the US, you can use the US Postal Service calculator and assume a Medium size flat rate box:  https://postcalc.usps.com/ \nOur goals are primarily about improving the campaign by adding new material to the Lairs book, expanding the lore of the underworld, and providing more player options. \nThe compiled and unlocked goals are listed first, then the 3 next goals in line. With your help, we hope to unlock everything and provide a rich, dark, and dangerous campaign!\nAnd that exceeds our wildest dreams by a ton! Thank you to all backers for your support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nKobold Press has published over 100 printed books and hundreds of PDF releases in its 13-year history. The main challenges to timely completion have been the loss of designers or artists due to illness or family issues. While there is no guarantee that the team will remain healthy, you'll be kept informed if any such issues come up.\n\nWe have a full manuscript for the Empire of the Ghouls campaign currently in editing, and we have designers working on the Player's Guide and Lairs. However, there are always risks, and the largest risk for a small company like Kobold Press is a health issue or personal tragedy for one of our primary contributors, such as the publisher, art director, or lead editor. We can't plan around that, but we have mitigated it by having text and art and maps either complete or assigned.\n\nIn addition, our past projects have shown us that overseas manufacturing and shipping to locations outside the US both carry substantial risks, especially with respect to 1) tariffs, brokerage fees, and customs fees, and 2) increases in US postal costs. To address the first we partner with EU and Canadian partners, and we are hedging against the second by charging postage separately in BackerKit.\n\nBased on prior years' trends, we fully anticipate another rate increase by the US Postal Service on January 1, 2020. If it follows past years, it will affect shipping overseas to a larger degree than US shipping, where we expect a more moderate increase in costs. You can find US international postal rates for a 3 pound hardcover to 5 pound multi-volume package here: https://postcalc.usps.com/\n\nIn addition, the complexity of international fulfillment mean that overseas rewards will take longer to fulfill than rewards shipped within the US. We strive to make sure they are as timely as possible, but working with overseas partners invariably means that timelines are longer and deliveries more complex.\n\nOn the digital side, please note that Roll20\u00ae is not responsible for the completion, quality, or timely delivery of this content; it will deliver the associated reward only if and when all digital materials are provided in a timely manner.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Underworld Player's Guide PDF", "descp": "Get new PC races, subclasses, backgrounds, spells, gear, and more in the Underworld Player's Guide PDF.\nINCLUDES:\nUnderworld Player's Guide PDF\nAccess to Updates and Streams", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2020"}], "stat": ["58 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 14 or more", "title": "Underworld Lairs PDF", "descp": "The maps and encounters for the undead and their allies, on the surface and underground.

It's a dive into pre-colonial Africa for all the rich lore you've never heard of. It's an exploration into a world where the majority of the faces are dark, yet isn't constrained to one corner. It's a world where women hold power equal to men and the merit of ones soul is what propels them through life. It's a world where spirits aren't to be feared, they are to be embraced. In a time where we know that representation matters, this project is an effort to add to that spirit in the way I know best. Narrative fiction in the nerdiest of flavors. \nSwordsfall is made up of three key parts; World Anvil, Tabletop RPG and Stories/Novels. Each of them telling a different part in the lore that is the world of Tikor. This Setting and Artbook is part of that synergy and the first step toward realizing the Tabletop RPG.\n For the Full Plan - Check out the Swordsfall Patreon\n Read our Feature in Kotaku!\nFinal Concept Piece for the Minos - Art by T'umo Mere\nThe Story So Far...\nIn the beginning... Tikor is a world where deities and spirits are as real as the nature that surrounds them. Since the earliest writings of mankind, the gods have been there with them. They are a vital part of the makeup of human societies across the globe. This is in a way to be expected. Humans were in fact, created by the gods. Various great deities created cultures of their design and ethos. As time marched forward, these various cultures and groups co-existed. Sometimes contentiously, sometimes harmoniously, but always striving to co-exist. \nConcept Art for the Dihoma - Artwork by Tumo Mere\n\nHistory, however, would change over the course of a tragic day and its horrific night. Mime, the Garuda deity of Wisdom, is assassinated at the hands of an alleged Vinyatian assassin. Mortal hands had never slain a deity. As tensions between the rival nations of Garuda and Vinyata soared under a long Tikor night, a bloody battle erupted between the two sides. A truce was called once the truth was revealed, but not before irreversible damage to both sides was done. \nDespite the armistice between bitter enemies, the wounds of that day will forever linger. The world heaves as the one constant, the gods themselves, waver and a new struggle begins.\nSwordsfall Logo Designed by Taylor Ruddle\nTHE YEAR 10 A.R\nAs the world still recovers, ten years after the bloody events that ended the Era, its fallout begins to appear. Rumors begin to give rise around the world of the arrival of a new kind of weapon. Instruments capable of killing gods, Grim Arms. Could this be related to the unsolved assassination of Mime? \nIn Garuda, a power struggle is in full effect as the current ruler of The Divine Order of the Phoenix, Amma Zencora, vies to hold onto his ill-gotten throne. How far will the ruler go to defend the throne he so desperately wants to hold on to? \nKevin Hou has allowed his art be used in Swordsfall\nVinyata is adjusting to a world with one less major city and cultural hub. The Eastern Node having been destroyed during the bloody war at the End of the Era. An unpleasant surprise emerges as they rebuild and a rash of malevolent spirits now roam the region. The souls of those lost 10 years still attached to the mortal plane, hungry for vengeance and retribution.\nHawklore's neutrality during The Longest Night has finally paid dividends. Literally. The God King, Hawken, basks in the increasing wealth of his nation. On the outside, it seems like a rich paradise where any want can be attained. Yet below, in the dingy streets of the capital city, High Perch, dissension stirs.\nAn early concept sketch of the Minos - Art by T'umo Mere\nRumors abound that the desolate stretch of land known as the Ebon Cascade has stirred with a new form of horror. Something cunning. And it's uniting the monstrous beings that call it home. Whispers say a Raksha is on Tikor, hiding away, building an army. None want to believe the horrifying rumor, yet none dare to confirm it either.\nIn the boundless waters of The Grand Divide, new forces stir as the largest pirate fleet of them all, Heaven's Fall, begins to marshal. With the cold genius of Nubia leading them, her power has begun to make those on land to take notice. The law of the sea changes as rumors of an alliance between her and the tech genius, Ken Musa begin to stir.\nIn all corners of the world, events are in motion.\n Visit the website - Official Swordsfall Website\nThe Book\nWelcome to Tikor will be an 8.5\" x 11\" hardcover book, printed on premium color for the richest and vivid colors. With this being an artbook, the quality and feel of the book is important.\n*Update* Due to the overwhelming support of our backers, we hit the goal for OFFSET PRINTING! The book will be printed by PrintNinja, with the solid binding and paper quality you wanted!\nThe main point of this Kickstarter is to raise money for the art. Being able to see the dynamic characters and unique setting with your own eyes is something that can't be replaced. The goal represents the minimum needed to make that happen.\nAs for the book, the length will be around 150 pages, though it could be longer depending on the amount of money raised. The max page count will be around 200 pages no matter what. \nNot the Final Version - Design by Taylor Ruddle\n\nThe Setting and Art Book will be a combination of T'umo's art, and Brandon's lore. Each piece of detailed full-color art will be accompanied by information about the person, place or thing it depicts For those only interested in the art, this lore will help bring the art to life and give it meaning. The kind of book you can sit down and just read.\nHowever, for those interested in the setting for their own games of the future Swordsfall RPG, then this serves as your window to the Afropunk setting. Throughout the pages, you will find a living world that easily makes the backdrop the right Tabletop System. However, this Setting and Artbook contains NO RULES. Just pure, sweet narrative world-building and fantastic art.\nSwordsfall itself has its own custom system that is deep into development.  Much of the art from the artbook will be used in the Corebook itself. Supporting this Kickstarter makes the Corebook's development even faster.\nAn early concept sketch of the Minos - Art by T'umo Mere\nThe Wallpapers\nAs a bonus to our backers all of T'umo's gorgeous work will be turned into amazing high-quality Wallpapers for your PC and phone. While the art will be used in both the Art Book and Corebook, I also want to share it with you the fans. And nothing is better than a gorgeous wallpaper on your home screen.\nThe World Map of Tikor makes for a sexy wallpaper\nAlmost every piece of art that is generated through this Kickstarter will be turned into a vivid piece of wallpaper. As well, there will be multiple resolutions available so you can always have the right size for your screen. We'll be conducting a poll after the Kickstarter to find out what the most used resolutions are. (I doubt we'll be able to do 15 resolutions for all the art)\nThat means you're not just getting the World Map as a wallpaper, but a ton of different ones with different art on it. Do you have a favorite profession? Or a favorite city in Swordsfall? Well, I'm sure there will be a wallpaper with it on it. We plan to have over 50 wallpapers in the bundle. \nA big ol fat zip of Wallpaper goodness.\nA Work in Progress shot of the Griot Wallpaper - Art by T'umo Mere, Design by Taylor Ruddle\nThe Poster\nFor the Kickstarter there will be a Limited Edition run of a full-color Poster of the final book cover. The final art cover hasn't been finalized yet, but watch for updates on Kickstarter or the Swordsfall Patreon to see what the final image is. As well, a digital version will be included with all Kickstarter PDF's as part of the Digital Stretch Goals!\nThe Poster of the Minos, currently available on Redbubble!\nIf you like the art, like the poster, then check out our shop! We already have shirts, stickers, and more already available. Buying Swordsfall swag also supports the artists! All our artists receive royalties on shirts their art is featured on.\nCheck out our Official Merchandise: The Swordsfall Shop\nSo, what exactly is the world within the pages of this book? Well, Tikor is a world divided, both in idea and land. Yet, hope remains as the two halves are only divided, not separated. The Northern Hemisphere of Tikor sports much more moderate temperatures and expansive grasslands in the center. The tip of the northern region is snow-capped, with the furthest tips permanently covered in ice.\nThe Southern Hemisphere of Tikor, on the other hand, is essentially a desert wasteland. Or at least that's what some will say. Despite the harsh conditions and cunning predators, various cultures have made a home among the barren sand and oppressive heat. With dunes that sing hypnotic lullabies, mammoth beasts and a second sun that relentlessly bakes the land, the southern half is worlds different from the North.\nThe World of Tikor\n Garuda - The largest nation in the Northwestern Hemisphere of Tikor. A land of green and grasslands, it's headed by the Order of the Divine Phoenix. The organization itself was created by the deities of the land, The Divinity.\n Vinyata - The eternal rival to Garuda and the largest nation in the Southern Hemisphere of Tikor. The desert land is home to the Dracon, a culture descended from the only heroic dragon in history, Ryuu-jin. Despite the unforgiving landscape, the people of the desert have found solace underneath enormous domed cities.\n Hawklore - On the eastern edge of the Northern half of Tikor, lies a nation sitting singular. The country is embroiled in no battles, sieges or upsets to the throne. Instead, it's been lead by one single man, a god in fact. Hawken. And within his cool and steady grip, the nation has remained at the forefront of Azurean mining and economics.\n Grimnest -The living mountain, Enkai, separates Garuda from the western portion of the Northern Hemisphere.  The wrathful deity hasn't allowed a single person to cross his crags in a millennia. It's in this isolation that the rule less land of Grimnest sits. With no official government or ruler, its a land truly free. And also home to pirates, raiders and the spirit powered bounty hunters to reign them in.\n Ramnos - Nestled in the southernmost part of the Southern Hemisphere, this reclusive nation avoids attention at almost all cost. For them, being forgotten is the best thing they could do. Trade in and out of their nation is limited, and trust is a temporary arrangement in Ramnos. And with it being located between the horrors that wait in Ebon Cascade and the Outskirts of Vinyata on the other side, most who are born there stay there.\nSecond set of concept art for the Dihoma - Art by T'umo Mere\n\n Independent Freeland of Teslan - A small island located off of Grimnest. Tucked away in the turbulent ocean, Crystal Priest train to control their gift, all while studying the secrets to Hekan itself. The school for these Azurean molders, Druse Academy, rarely allows visitors into its halls. And the ring of Sentrylocks guarding the island makes it a place people only come to by invitation.\n The Grand Divide -The vast ocean that almost splits the land in two has its own personality. Its sparkling blue and green seas can turn harsh at any given moment. With hellish winds and torrential rain coming on seemingly at its whim. And if the weather doesn't get you, the pirates may. Yet millions flock to the sea everywhere. In search of glory, freedom, and prizes on its sea.\n Ebon Cascade - This perilous zone has swallowed up a chunk of the western part of the Southern Hemisphere. The air near the plagued lands seem to make every pore cry out, threatening to vomit. The waters run yellow with poison and the air feels stiff with suffering. Yet throughout the harshness, humans continue to visit the lands. Pushing their luck, and eventually their lives.\n The Canopy -  Located on the very western quarter of the Northern Hemisphere, this mountain region is unlike anything on Tikor. The peaks of the half a dozen mountains can't be seen from the ground level. Even if you could see them, these majestic peaks are not safe for visiting or habitation. Tales float around about mysterious creatures that whisk away anyone that dares venture into these lands.\nMinos Concept Bust - Art by Tumo Mere\n For More Lore: The Swordsfall World Anvil\n $4,000 \nMoar art from T'umo Mere\nA Deadquiver in action - T'umo Mere\nAt this Pledge level we'll be able to add more fantastic artwork to the Welcome to Tikor. Drawn by Swordsfall team member, T'umo Mere. We'll be adding in more characters to help further illustrate Tikor's diversity with more their detailed illustrations.\n\n $7,000 \nLandscapes and Cities from Sabina Lewis\nSphaerum (Previous Work) - Art by Sabina Lewis\nA world simply isn't complete without vivid scenery to immerse yourself in. To accomplish that, we've enlisted the help of a master in landscape design. The amazing Sabina Lewis! She's agreed to be a guest member on the Swordsfall to help bring the luscious world to life. When we hit this pledge level she'll be able to bring Tikor's incredible world to life.\n\n $10,000 \n Second PDF \"Tikor: The Professionals\"\nNot the Final Version - Design by Taylor Ruddle\nWith your continued support we will be able to release a SECOND PDF as part of the Kickstarter. In the future this will be sold separately, but this and any other unlocked PDF's will be included as part of your Kickstarter!\nTikor: The Professionals will detail the 34 unique professions used in the Swordsfall Corebook. However, they are not classes, they truly are Professions. They are a symbol of not what someone is, but truly what they accomplish in life. The Professionals will talk about these professions in detail including history, location and important figures within each. Each Profession will be accompanied with full page art from T'umo Mere.\n\n $12,000 \nChibi Profession Art and Pins\nA Chibi Celestial Shield in the middle along side two other examples\nSwordsfall team member Taylor Ruddle has long had a love for Chibi art, even studying in Japan to hone his art. He's bring those skills to Tikor by designing Chibi versions of all 34 of Swordsfall's Professions. \nThen we're going to take those adorable creations and craft quality pins from them. They're cute, and fiercely adorable.\n\n $15,000 \n10 page Comic \"The Rise of Nubia\" Prologue\nThe story of Tikor's most famous and powerful pirate is one that needs more than just words. To describe the true depth of the character, only a comic can suffice. And so if we hit this goal Brandon and T'umo will credit a comic of Nubia, leader of Heaven's Fall.\nNubia has become a fan favorite among those who have read the Swordsfall World Anvil. Her strong spirit and fire has made her a often talked about character. The story of her rise may be known by some already, but it's never been shown in this kind of detail or color. \n $20,000 \nThird PDF - \"Pantheons of Tikor\"\nNot the Final Version - Art by T'umo Mere | Design by Taylor Ruddle\nThe world of Tikor would not be where it is without the help of its divine beings. Almost the entire world is covered in various spirits and deities. Some influencing the people, and some hindering them.\nIf we reach this goal another PDF will be produced. This one all about the Pantheons that exist on Tikor. From the The Divinity in Garuda to the Orisha in the Outskirts of Vinyata, each pantheon will be detailed. Each pantheon will have gorgeous art alongside of it to show you the lives the divine live.\n$26,000 \nTop Notch Editing and Formatting\nAt this point with now three books in the lineup, we've more than maxed our ability to edit in house or within our circles. It's official become time to bring in the experts.\nIf we hit this tier we'll be able to commission the help of a number of freelance editors to help make the books truly shine. And most importantly, be effortlessly readable (because sometimes English is hard).\n $35,000 \nDragons and Creatures from Jonah Lobe\nDragons from Elder Scrolls: Skyrim - Designed by Jonah Lobe\nA true legendary figure has joined the Swordsfall team for a limited engagement. His creatures are ones you've certainly seen before. Jonah was the genius behind many of the Tamriel's most famous creatures such as the Dragons, Giants, and Draugr. He was also the whiz behind the grotesque Deathclaw and freakish Super Mutants from Fallout 4.\nIf we reach $35,000 the master Jonah himself will apply his dragon scales to the Afropunk style of The Wretched Ones. Swordsfall's own winged horrors. As well, he'll also draw other varied creatures from Tikor's wildlife.\n\n$50,000\nCharacter Design From Venus Bambisa\nTitan Slayer: Tinishi (Previous Work) - Art by Venus Bambisa\nThe look and feel of characters is important to Swordsfall, we want to create truly something unique. To help make the Tikor as rich as possible, we're bringing one of South Africa's most talented Character Concept artist, Venus Bambisa.\nHer design's are just jaw dropping in the way they same to flow an anime style with black faces. Her Artstation has character designs of all sorts, each of them elegant, sleek and badass. I especially love how she shows a characters increase in power. Who doesn't love transforming heroes?\n\n $70,000 \nFourth PDF - \"The Animalists' Guide to Creatures\" - Art by Jonah Lobe and T'umo Mere\nNot the Final Version - Design by Taylor Ruddle\nThe final and ultimate goal. A FOURTH book through this kickstarter, and the most expensive. That's because this book will be the most art heavy of them all, featuring art from both Jonah Lobe and T'umo Mere.\nAt this final amount we'll craft a trip through the wildlife across Tikor. From the monstrous Nandi Bear to the adorable and house trained Aardwolf. Each animal will be drawn by one of these dynamic pair. This is not a Monster Manual however, this, like the other books, will be narrative journey through the world. Instead focusing on the the animals and how they fit into the world. Their tales and even their bestial gods.\n\n$100,000\nThe Azurean Finish\nArtist Rendering of the Boxset, not ANYWHERE close to the final design. (The final version will be way cooler, and full of T'umo art)\nWhen we hit the $100,000 goal, I can do what people have wanted for over a week, ALL of the books printed. However, I'm going to do one better and not just print all four books, but print them in stupid high quality. And put in a few little extras. Lets see what your getting!\nThe Details\nAll four books printed\nTwo Variant covers for the Setting and Artbook\nEmbossed covers on all books\nSilk Ribbon bookmark on all books\nAll tucked in a Custom Slipcase with special art\n\n$130,000\nUnleash the Beast\nSwordsfall Studios can come to life\nWhen we hit $130,000 the Formation of Swordsfall Studios will begin! This will allow the core team to work full-time on future projects! Brandon and T'umo will be able to devote their full time and energy to the world!\nThat means more content, the RPG sooner and more! We have so much stuff planned, short run comics, adventures and even modules.

Robert A. Heinlein, \"Glory Road\", 1963\nRoleplaying games often feature flashy, instantaneous magic.  Magic users hurl fireballs, call down lightning, and summon monsters, all within an instant and with much visual fanfare.  When you look to magic systems in the real world, though, things are rarely so dramatic.  \nThe development of magical beliefs grew out of the human need for control of the world or the self.  For real world practitioners, magic takes time, effort, care, and patience.  It is anything but spontaneous.  It doesn't share the flavor of the sorcery found in high fantasy rpgs, but real world traditional magic practices can provide a wealth of interesting ideas for games that take a more subtle approach to things.\nOther Magic is an old style zine designed to translate \"real\" magic practices into a format that is useful for fantasy and horror rpgs.  OSR-style versions of the spells will be provided, but the content will be written in a way that will make the material easily adaptable to just about any system.    \nIn addition to the spells and rituals themselves, the zine will give background information about the magic traditions which inspired them.  It will also include ingredient lists, tips on running subtle magic campaigns, and more.  The first issue will feature information and game materials related to American hoodoo, Pennsylvania Dutch braucherei/powwowing, and other forms of folk magic that have not been featured in many rpgs.  \nIn keeping with the goals of Zine Quest, Other Magic will be printed as a stapled black and white 5.5 x 8.5 booklet.  It will be approximately 36 pages long, not counting the cardstock cover (front, inside front, inside back, and back).  \nGiven the nature of the project, I don't have any stretch goals planned at this time.  \nSupporter\nFor $1 you can be a supporter of the project.  That will allow you participate in the comments section and view all the update information.\nPDF Only\nFor $5 you will receive a full copy of the PDF.  \nPrint Plus PDF\nFor $10 you will receive a print copy of the zine (shipping included in the price) and a copy of the PDF.\nShipping is included in the price for orders shipped within the US.  This particular issue doesn't include an option for international orders of the print zine.  I am currently exploring possible ways to include that as an option, but so far have not found an affordable solution. Any advice would be appreciated!\nI can be contacted directly at jesse@woodcutgames.com if you have any questions or comments!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThough nobody can predict the unforeseen, I don't expect any real difficulties with producing and distributing the zine within the estimated timelines. A significant portion of the zine has already been written, and I have detailed notes for the rest of it ready to go. At this point I have about a week of writing left. I have selected and priced the art that I will be using, and have set up the template for the zine. My proofreading and editing folks are ready to go. The only thing left after that is to finish putting everything in the template and having some more layout work done. I should be ready to go to print by the end of the campaign or very soon after.\n\nThe money generated from the campaign will primarily be used for art, printing, and production costs. We will be physically producing the final product ourselves, in good old-fashioned DIY tradition, so there won't be any possible delays from using third-party solutions.\n\nThis is my first Kickstarter, but I have produced a number of work-related booklets and handbooks in the past, so I am familiar with the process.

A shadowed tree-line where no-one dares cross and whose boundaries go undisturbed.\nThis is not the woods of peaceful fey and beast, but the dark and twisted children\u2019s tale that kept you full of terror. It is a world of fear, madness, and bloodshed; ruled over by the uncaring watch of ancient trees. There is no bargaining with the primal forces that rule the uncivilized world, as you have nothing they could ever want.\nThe woods do not care for you. Never forget that.\nInto the Wyrd and Wild is a supplemental book for those seeking to incorporate a weird and terrifying wilderness into their role-playing game. Players and GMs who enjoy a level of horror and prefer the sweeping, darkened landscapes of forest and mires to the well-trodden cobblestone of dungeons need look no further when it comes to books. Presented within the book is a light overhaul of the adventuring system, modified to fit better with a campaign centered around forays into the frightening wilderness.\nIn addition to stocking the area with new monsters and set pieces, Into the Wyrd and Wild is also an attempt to increase the playability of the wilderness. Rather than have the wilderness remain a place along the way to a dungeon, it seeks to make the wilderness a dungeon in itself. Included in this is an essay on design theory as well as a way to easily and randomly construct a wilderness dungeon.\nThe book contains a variety of information for both GM and players alike. For players there is a vast array of strange items and artifacts, each embodying the haunting and feral nature of the Wyrd and Wild. There is also a section devoted to spells, specifically, Wyrd magics that may be just as deadly to the caster but offer great and terrible powers if they choose to harness it. Finally there is a list of the odd and useful floras that dwell within the wilds, plant-life that ranges from profitable and wondrous, to deadly and loathsome.\nFor GMs, this book contains every possible thing you might need to run a wilderness-horror themed game. Monsters that present unique and specific challenges to the player, while also being terrifying and lethal; simple rules for use in the Wilds that make gameplay both easier and deeper; unique factions that exist within the Wilds, for use or adaptation in a home game; and of course a plethora of tables for generating random locations, treasures, encounters, and more. \n While the contents of Into the Wyrd and Wild were designed for D&D and the OSR, this book has been written to be as system-neutral as possible. This means that:\nRules and stats are written bare-bone with the intention of being widely compatible.\nEnough information is given that a GM and player can easily adapt it to their own preferred system.\nThe book contains:\nRules for wilderness travel and survival\nRules for Moon Cycles and strange phases.\nRules for hunting, tracking, and butchering monsters.\n40+ dangerous and terrifying monsters.\n40+ strange and savage items.\n40+ spells and rules for channeling the Wyrd.\nAn essay and guideline on running and creating \"wilderness dungeons.\"\nA step-by-step guide for generating your own wilderness adventure.\n100 random wilderness locations.\nTables upon tables of random diseases, wilderness dressings, traps, hazards, flora, encounters, and MORE.\nAll illustrated with over 150 pieces of original art.\nWhether you are a veteran group looking to make a foray into the terrifying Wilds, or new to the hobby and looking to spice up your game, Into the Wyrd and Wild provides something for everyone. \n $15 Into the Wyrd and Wild PDF\nInto the Wyrd and Wild in PDF format, for those on a budget or who prefer a digital version of the book.

In this game, players assume the roles of desperate people who come forth to fight against the imminent apocalypse promised by the dreaded Destroyer of Worlds, the Hunger in the Void, the being known as the Demon Lord. Since the first Kickstarter campaign three years ago, Schwalb Entertainment has revealed the hidden kingdoms, the terrifying vistas of Hell, the madness of the Void, and has even taken you to a post-apocalyptic world in which the Demon Lord has already won. Now, though, is the time to arm your heroes with even greater weapons so that you can take the fight to the darkness and triumph. \nOccult Philosophy, the first major expansion to this sinister game, offers 800 new spells divided between forty traditions of magic. Whether you are calling down a mountain to shatter the armies of the Witch-King or opening a portal to the ancient past before the troubles began on Urth, Occult Philosophy ramps up the magic in the game. Each tradition receives a considerable expansion, with spell offerings for rank 0 to rank 10, each of which has been tested for use in your campaigns. If you want to master the secrets of Battle magic or plumb the depths of Forbidden magic, Occult Philosophy has you covered.\nWant to learn more about Occult Philosophy? Check out these interviews with Mud & Blood, Tales of Blood and Stone, and TabletopBabble.\nShadow of the Demon Lord is a horror-fantasy tabletop adventure game that presents a world standing on the brink of annihilation. In this game, you and your friends play characters charged with fighting back against the spreading evil, whether that involves tracking down potent relics, exploring ancient faerie ruins, journeying into Hell to bargain with the Devil, or battling demons and the cultists who summon them. \nIf you\u2019re new to this game, check out some of the great reviews about Shadow of the Demon Lord here, here, here, and here, and some live-plays of the game: here, here, and here.\nFinally, you can grab a copy of the quick start rules and a starting adventure for almost free, right here.\nThe book is written and extensively tested, so we\u2019re ready to move to the next stage of production, which involves editing, layout, art direction, and the rest. Given the size of the book and the expenses involved, I\u2019m asking for your help to bring this project over the finish line. The best way to help is to choose a pledge level found below and back the campaign. The level you choose determines the rewards you get in return for your support. If the project funds, your dollars go toward purchasing art, paying for editing, and covering the other production costs. Of course, if the project doesn\u2019t fund, you pay nothing and everyone becomes quite sad. If you can\u2019t help out by backing at a pledge level, we\u2019d be mighty grateful if you spread the word to those who can. \n[NEW!] Digital Spell Cards\nOn DriveThruRPG, I've been selling spell cards for most of the spells presented in game. Now, backers at the $50 or higher pledge levels automatically gain digital spell cards for every spell presented in Occult Philosophy to make using this awesome project even easier. How much value does this pledge add to your game? Well, each deck includes at least 18 spells and MSRP is a $1 per deck. At 42 decks, that's a $42 bucks worth of content you get for free!\nOver the last few years, we\u2019ve released a ton of great content for the game.

Price includes shipping.\nDemon Lord Dice ($25 US/$35 International)\nA set of 9 dice with the Schwalb Entertainment logo featured on the 6. Dripping with evil, the dice set includes 3 white dice (boons), 3 black dice (banes), and 3 red dice (damage).\nDigital Spell Cards ($15)\nYou can complete your collection of digital spell cards, getting all the decks released for the game until this KS for a low price of $15. These decks include all card sets from the core rulebook, A Glorious Death, Demon Lord's Companion, Demon Lord's Companion 2, Exquisite Agony, Godless, Hunger in the Void, Terrible Beauty, and Tombs of the Desolation.\nIn addition to the above add-ons, you can also pick up Demon Lord Turn Tokens and Demon Lord Fortune Tokens.\nShadow of the Demon Lord Turn Token (1) - $10\nThis large 50mm token is 4mm thick, and brings real weight to the table. It can be used to track the Fast and Slow combat rounds, and the token features white enamel letters and red enamel sigils and glowing eyes. Not for the faint hearted. Designed by Lee Smith and made by Campaign Coins under license from Schwalb Entertainment.\nShadow of the Demon Lord Fortune Tokens (6) - $10\nThese tokens are emblazoned with the word Fortune. The top side features the Demon Lord symbol in magnificent 3D, while the reverse has the design in 2D, making it naturally lie flat on the table. Comes as a pack of 6 tokens. Designed by Lee Smith and made by Campaign Coins under license from Schwalb Entertainment.\nShadow of the Demon Lord Dice Tray (1) - $14.99\nThe Demon Lord approaches... your hands are shaking... your character has one chance to live... now would be a bad time to lose your dice.\nThis deluxe pleather dice tray will keep your dice where you need them during your sessions of Shadow of the Demon Lord.\nThe dice tray packs flat with your rulebook and is easy to snap together for play.\nIt features the legendary Demon Lord design by Schwalb Entertainment, printed in stark bone white on jet black pleather.

C\nShipping\nFor any and all of the Campaign Coins accessories, add $5 to your pledge for US, Canada, and the Rest of the World. Add $3 to your pledge for Asia/New Zealand/Australia.  \nFor now, you\u2019ll pay shipping for printed copies of Occult Philosophy directly to the printer when you redeem your at-cost coupon. If we hit a funding level that allows us to do an offset print run for Occult Philosophy, you\u2019ll pay shipping after the campaign closes through Backerkit. Doing so allows us to avoid distorting the funding levels to give us an accurate estimate of how much money we've raised, and it allows us time to find the best shipping options for the campaign. Typically, I can ship out a book to US customers for about $6 (includes shipping, box, and tape). \nFor international backers (under 4 lb.), we\u2019re in $40-50 range, which sucks on so many levels. Since international shipping rates keep climbing, I\u2019m offering the print-on-demand coupon, so you can receive the book for the cost of glue, paper, and binding. I\u2019ve ordered plenty of hardback books from Lightning Source, and the quality is good.

Check me out on Google Drive!\nHAIL TO THE DEMON LORD!\nThis Kickstarter is for two different hardcover books for D&D 5e and the Shadow of the Demon Lord RPG: the already complete 338 page Trade War and the Imperial Matchmaker mega adventure.\nTRADE WAR (journey across Soburin on quests before a battle and race up Hone-Noroi Bone Keep) collects the six existing Mists of Akuma adventures into one book with connecting chapters to carry the campaign from one module to the next (for folks that already have the softcover adventures there's a shorter 132 page softcover supplement available).\nTRADE WAR: The adventurers face off against their first great challenges near and within Robai-Shita Temple in Shibai, traveling all over Soburin as the Mub\u014d Brothers seek vengeance for their murdered brethren while fate puts the party onto the trail of nature demons and black torii gates of mysterious purpose. After meddling in the affairs of two of the immortal Imperial Siblings, staving off rebellion in Samon, saving Fuson Prefecture from a reign of terror, and deciding the fate of a secret oni city, the PCs run afoul of the ancient Pale Master's servants in Kizaki! Soon the powerful necromancer's bone keep appears as various armies are mobilized leading to a climactic siege against undead legions followed by a harrowing invasion of Hone-Noroi Keep's nine hellish levels where the party either defeats the Pale Master once and for all or become his thralls! \nWith 50 maps, over 100 NPCs and monsters, and an already proofed print version, it'll keep your table shoulder-deep in action-packed adventures for months and months of excellent gaming. \nIMPERIAL MATCHMAKER (webs of intrigue between the nobles of Soburin in a highly-detailed metropolis) is being forged with the help of the talented Savannah Broadway and Michael McCarthy. This sprawling exploration inside of the imperial capital of Sanbaoshi is brought to life with illustrations from world-class artist Claudio Pozas, Nathanael Batchelor, Jacob Blackmon, Indi Martin, Renan Moraes, Sara Shijo, and Hope Swain. Over half of Imperial Matchmaker has been written and playtested already, and with your help I'll be able to bring in my Canadian-counterpart (McCarthy) and Savannah to put the final elements of the book in place with all the polish (and beautiful artwork) it deserves.\nIMPERIAL MATCHMAKER: An enmity between the Gekido, Hakaisuru, Kirai, and Namida clans has persisted for ages, the wounds from the Battle of Broken Spears torn open every few years by border skirmishes and trade disputes. Seeking to win the minds of the people by a grand gesture during these dark times, Emperor Hitoshi Masuto has arranged an alliance between the quarreling noble families\u201420 brides and grooms have been chosen to wed in celebration of the 10th anniversary of the decisive final battle in the rebellion against more than a century of foreign occupation. \nClick here for the Google Drive file! (D&D 5E only)\nGroups that are playing through Imperial Matchmaker for 5E receive this book of pregenerated characters (levels 3rd through 10th) available to either use themselves or for the GM to make adversaries the adventurers compete against amidst the intrigue in Sanbaoshi! Several of the capital's locations tie into sub-plots for these iconics, encouraging players to explore the city as they try to help (or hinder) the Imperial Matchmaker's arranged weddings.\nAt-Cost Vouchers?\nBackers at $19 and up get one or more at-cost vouchers for print copies of Trade War, Imperial Matchmaker, and the core Mists of Akuma setting book.

Offering complete physical copies as pledge rewards creates limitations that Print-On-Demand and at-cost vouchers do not have to accommodate\u2014for example, 20 additional pages of content are developed for Imperial Matchmaker, and 200 people are getting a print copy, adding those to the book costs $0.71 cents a book (which would translate to $142 not calculated into the funding goal). I've run several Kickstarters using vouchers as rewards and only one with a direct print copy available from the start: Hypercorps 2099 (a cyberpunk superhero world for Pathfinder/5E). While backers embraced that print option, it forced limitations onto both the creative and development processes of the book that frankly didn't need to be there, and due to a relatively incremental increase in the cost of paper and 20 extra pages of content, fulfilling rewards nearly bankrupted me (although I still released the larger book because that's what folks deserved to get). While it's still a wonderful book and fulfills the original vision for Hypercorps 2099, there was no way to vastly over deliver and make a bigger, better book (like the Veranthea Codex [doubled estimated page count], Book of Exalted Darkness [also doubled estimated page count], and first Mists of Akuma Kickstarters [150% estimated page count]) and my goal here is to make these the best they can be.\n$5 - Mists of Akuma GM screen at-cost print voucher (5e or SotDL)\n$5 - Mists of Akuma Iconics PDF & at-cost print voucher (5e only)\n$10 - Mists of Akuma campaign setting PDF (5e or SotDL)\n$15 - Mists of Akuma campaign setting PDF & at-cost print voucher (5e or SotDL)\n$10 - Trade War supplement PDF (5e or SotDL; 132 pages)\n$15 - Trade War supplement PDF & at-cost print voucher (5e or SotDL; 132 page softback)\nThere are more people in the wings for stretch goals (Andrew Engelbrite, Dirk van de Rijt, Brandes Stoddard, Robert Lashley, Chris Davies, and others) and I'm excited to reveal what they've got planned\u2014but can't do that until we get past the first one! \nThis first new designer is someone you probably have seen the writing of but only under his Twitter handle: @dr5bludgeoning.

Wrath of the Gatekeepers is the sequel to the already successful, Chronicle of the Gatekeepers campaign serial adventure path.  The amazing folks over at DawnforgeCast recorded a two-part session of the the original Chronicle of the Gatekeepers campaign serial adventure path. You can watch it below!\nAlpha - Resurrection of the Drowned City\nIt's been two years since the lost city of Atlantis appeared in the sky above Exodus, and crashed into the Orin Sea, and finally, the fires are out. Every country and power on Exodus has been sending one expedition after another to the still-floating city, trying to pierce its defenses and steal its secrets. None of them have returned, and many of them have failed to even approach the city's shores before being sunk (or often worse) by the city's defenses, or the swarm of flying ships that have become commonplace in the skies above. It isn't simply chance that so many ships have been destroyed on approach - until just a few weeks ago now, Atlantis has been embroiled in a vicious and bloody civil war, between the insectoid Vespan natives -- servants to the Atlanteans themselves, and the mighty rhino-faced kaylethon -- mercenaries serving an unknown master. It's time to raid Atlantis. Resurrection of the Drowned City is an adventure for 4th level characters, in the NeoExodus Campaign Setting. It is the Alpha adventure that begins the Wrath of the Gatekeepers adventure serial and is a sequel to the events of the Chronicle of the Gatekeepers campaign serial adventure path.  \nDelta Adventures\nCyrix is a name that few on Exodus speak willingly. It is the name of a genocidal construct who wants nothing more than the freedom of all mechanical creatures from biological control. And he believes the best way to do that is the total eradication of living creatures. With stolen Atlantean technology that allows him to travel instantly anywhere, and rebuild himself from nothing, he has gone on a murderous rampage across Exodus, and needs to be stopped - over and over again.\nOmega - Threefold Immortality\nThe sentient construct Cyrix has been a force of destruction since his accidental creation many years ago. But when he got his hands, and his soul, on Atlantean technology, he went from a menace to preparing for a full-scale genocide of all biological life forms. He has been driven out of Atlantis, but the question of how he got there - and how he managed to take over the kaylethon army remain as unanswered as where he has been launching attacks from since he was destroyed in Atlantis. But Cyrix's mysterious masters aren't sitting quietly for long - with the incredible powers of Atlantis slipping from their grasp, the time has come to reveal themselves, and take action directly. Threefold Immortality is an adventure for 8th level characters, in the NeoExodus Campaign Setting. It is the Omega adventure that concludes the Wrath of the Gatekeepers adventure serial.\nWhen we reach our stretch goals, we have more options waiting for a chance to strut their stuff. Join us today, and let's make Pathfinder campaign worlds better, stronger, wilder and very interesting! \nThis project is being overseen directly by Michael McCarthy, Jeff Lee, George \"Loki\" Williams and Louis Porter Jr., who has been involved in the RPG industry combined for nearly twenty-five years. Louis Porter Jr Design over the last decade has released over 700 RPG related products in both the traditional brick and mortar retail store and the online PDF market.\nPatronage and Funding  \nThe fundraising goal we have for this project is $3,000 in a little under 35 days. We feel that amount will be enough to provide us with the cost of writing and artwork for this project so we can send copies of it out to the premiere retail gaming locations. We hope that we will be able to raise greater than the asked amount to include all kinds of interesting upgrades and add-ons to this project. \nWhat if you don\u2019t meet your goal? \nOne of the most important questions I am sure you asking is: What if the Campaign Serial doesn't fund will you still complete the AP? \nNo matter happens, the Campaign Serial will be completed. The Crisis of the World Eater Campaign Serial is an incredible story based off of a well-known and respected premise. If all the adventures are not funded completely through this Kickstarter, it means we will take a longer \u201croad\u201d to complete this. With this Kickstarter, our plans will be able to be completed much quicker. We are doing this campaign serial, we just want to make it the best campaign serial it can be.  \nThe reason we want you to support this campaign serial from the start because it shows your interest, zeal, and passion for the project. But most importantly, success creates MORE success for a Kickstarter project. The better this project does the more additional content we can add to it. Potential fans will become happy donors at a rapid pace when they see that this project is taking off like a rocket and growing fast. Jumping aboard early only helps boost the success of this project. We know all of fans are assured and self-confident that this project will fund fully and further than expected, but this is always a risk.  \nKickstarter Rewards  \nThe rewards are uncomplicated and an amazing deal for Pathfinder fans \u2014 and they keep making this the best book it can be.

The new setting was to be called Pirates of the Bronze Sky and it was to be a mash-up of Spelljammer and Birthright based off of the American Revolution. I wanted to make a counterpoint to WOTC\u2019s Eberron. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I like Eberron, but NeoExodus kind of covers some of the same areas Eberron does. Pirates of the Bronze Sky was going to be my steampunk meets Raiders of the Lost Ark inspiration and I knew the one thing to make the setting different was having floating islands and skyships to sail between them. What I really wanted to do is make a world that felt more cinematic and more exciting than your typical RPG setting. And with that, I needed to create races that were interesting different and unique to the setting. And that's how I came up with a Kaylethon. I think the Giff are very iconic to the setting of Spelljammer and I wanted that same thing for Pirates of The Bronze sky. So I took one of my favorite animal, the rhinoceros, added two more arms, gave them gunpowder pistols and I knew that would be something exciting that players had not seen before. But I still needed a culture to provide a background and a believable characteristic for them. So I thought and I thought and I came up with the Scottish because everybody knows kilts cool. And what's that the Kaylethon was born.\n\nWhile Kaylethon originally were created for Pirates of The Bronze Sky, they ended up in one of the first drafts for the adventure serial that we planned The Cross of Fire. We had them in a really great role as mercenaries, because that's what they are, and it really fit well for the campaign serial. While the kickstarter for this never got off the ground I always kept them in the back my mind to use later as an interesting race. And when I pitched Michael McCarthy the original concept of this I wanted to add in the Kaylethon again and bring them back into the light. And here we are several years after the original creation I finally got the sourcebook for them done and completed. and with that to give you a little more excitement here are the first four pages of the PDF so you can at least see and get an idea where we're trying to go with this race. I hope you enjoy it and as always thank you for your support for this Kickstarter.

It\u2019s not a book with adventures, spells, creatures, or magic items. It\u2019s not a book for characters at all, but a book for players! If you play or run roleplaying games, this book is for you. Inside this gorgeous hardcover book, suitable for your coffee table or your gaming table, you will find advice and suggestions for enhancing your RPG experience at the table and away from it. This is an insider\u2019s look at everything that goes into the hobby\u2014finding a group, making a character, running a game, creating adventures, finding all the right ideas, hosting a game\u2026and that\u2019s just for starters.         \nIf You\u2019re an Experienced Gamer\nYou\u2019ve been gaming for a while now. Maybe even years. You get the concepts, and you understand the rules. No one needs to explain the dice to you. Your Best Game Ever embraces the hobby you love, and provides real tips, immediately usable advice, and hands-on pointers you can use at your game table. You\u2019ll find everything here from enhancing immersion, tips for running games online, creating characters with depth, worldbuilding, designing rules, dealing with personality conflicts that arise at the table, and more!\nIf You\u2019re Fairly New to Gaming\nYour friends play RPGs. You\u2019ve maybe watched some streaming games, or given it a try a few times. You get the general idea, but where do you go from there? How do you really get into this hobby the way so many others have? This book will give you everything you need to learn how to choose the right game, how to fit into your game group or start your own group, and get you going on the fast track to being a great gamer.\nNot a Rule Book, But a Tool Book\nYour Best Game Ever is divided into three major sections: general game topics, being a player, and being a game master. There\u2019s even a section on designing your own game, and getting it published. And this isn\u2019t just a stuffy book on theory, either. You\u2019ll find actual suggestions you can use to create better characters with character arcs, real recipes you can make for game night (and even spruce them up for your genre of choice), specific suggestions for music and ambiance depending on genre, plot ideas, character ideas, and other ready-to-use material.         \nThis 240-page book will enable you to become a better gamer. You\u2019ll find ways to create and manage a great game group, tricks for game prep (and what to do if you haven\u2019t prepared!), understanding and managing game balance, and taking everything around you and incorporating it as inspiration for your game.\nMonte Cook, the principal author, has been playing RPGs for 40 years, and working on them professionally for 30 years. The MCG team, all of whom will be contributing, are an extremely seasoned group with a combined total of over 250 years of RPG experience. But we wanted to get an even wider and diverse set of experiences and points of view in this book, so we\u2019ve recruited a team of folks that will provide feedback as well as their own contributions for the book. This dream team of consulting experts includes:\nEric Campbell\nMatt Colville\nLuke Crane\nStacy Dellorfano\nTanya DePass\nAjit George\nJennell Jaquays\nEloy Lasanta\nTom Lommel\nMatthew Mercer\nSusan J. Morris\nAlina Pete\nJohn Rogers\nMonica Valentinelli\n\nThe book will also feature comics and cartoons from: \nJohn Kovalic (Dork Tower)\nVickie Lee (Dungeons and Doggos)\nAviv Or (Up to Four Players)\nBrian Patterson (d20 Monkey)\nLen Peralta (Geek-a-Week)\nAlina Pete (Weregeek)\nStan! (10x10Toon)\n\n(Scroll down for more details on Your Best Game Ever)\nIn 2011, Monte created Numenera, and with it, a game system called the Cypher System. This game system has won awards and has been lauded by gamers everywhere as a wonderfully different way to play games of any genre. In 2015, we created the Cypher System Rulebook (CSR) to help gamers use the system for any type of game they wanted to play\u2014fantasy, science fiction, horror, superheroes, and so on. You can get a copy of that book in this Kickstarter campaign, but we\u2019re also Kickstarting a new version that will come out in 2019. The new version will incorporate lots of new options for players, but perhaps best of all it will take the concepts from Your Best Game Ever and apply them directly to the Cypher System. These two books will work hand-in-hand to create the best Cypher game ever!         \n(Scroll down for more details on the new Cypher System Rulebook)\nIf you're new to the Cypher System and are curious about how it works, you can download the free Cypher System Rules Primer for an idea of how the game plays.    \nNow that the Kickstarter has funded, our stretch goals will focus on the development of various genre-focused books that will take the concepts found in the new CSR and take them one step further, with specific examples. Each of these additional books will include an entirely new and original campaign setting as well as lots of material and advice for making your own in the realms of science fiction, fantasy, and more. \nYou\u2019ve read the effusive descriptions above. Is Your Best Game Ever really for everyone? More importantly, is it for you? Maybe it would be better to just show you what\u2019s in the book. Here\u2019s a brief listing of some of the topics we'll cover:         \n                                      Click here for a closer look!  \n\nOur goal with this book is to make every game your best game ever. But we know\u2013as GMs, players, and designers ourselves\u2013that every game and every experience is unique. What\u2019s the hardest struggle you have with creating great games, either as a player or as a GM? Looking for some GM or player advice? Let us know at this link. (Once the KS is complete and we\u2019ve started working on the book, we\u2019ll look through your comments to make sure the book covers players\u2019 biggest issues and concerns.)         \nWhen we were finishing the new Numenera books, Discovery and Destiny, one of the first things that playtesters asked us was, are you going to incorporate some of the cool new material in these books into the Cypher System?         \nA valid question. And it got me (Monte) really thinking about the Cypher System Rulebook as a whole. I didn\u2019t want to change the rules\u2014I love the Cypher System, and wouldn\u2019t touch the mechanics. But developing Numenera Discovery and Destiny showed me that there was a lot we could add in terms of player abilities and flexibility, and what the CSR really needs is flexibility. The idea that you can create any campaign in any genre is fundamental to the whole idea. And I realized we could take some steps to push that idea a lot further.\nSo we\u2019re Kickstarting a brand new, revised 416-page Cypher System Rulebook. Before I go any further, though, let me say right now, if you\u2019ve got the existing Cypher System Rulebook and you\u2019re happy with it, great! These new ideas don\u2019t change the way the rules work. You still roll a d20, you\u2019ve still got difficulties 1\u23bc10, you\u2019ve still got characters with descriptors, types, and foci. NPCs have levels. PCs use effort to decrease the difficulty. Everything is still fully compatible with everything Cypher-related that we\u2019ve ever published. You\u2019ll be able to play a game with half the characters from the original CSR and half from the new CSR all at the table at the same time. The difference isn\u2019t in how the game is played, but in the choices players get to create and run their characters.         \nWhat I\u2019m most excited about are the ways I\u2019ve thought about over the last few years to make things more customizable so that you could even more easily use these rules in any setting. To that end, in this book we\u2019re dramatically streamlining the chapter on character focus, so that you can customize your character\u2019s focus to perfectly match the setting and your character concept. So if you\u2019re making a starship pilot, a superhero, or an occult investigator, you don\u2019t choose the one that fits best from a list of foci\u2014you take your character concept and tailor your focus so that it really fits what you want to do.\nBased on player feedback, we\u2019re also making what we call subtle cyphers\u2014cyphers that aren\u2019t tied to a specific object\u2014the default for all genres, and we\u2019ll be including way more of them. (You\u2019ll still be able to have cyphers as objects too.) This will make applying the concept of cyphers, which is obviously core to the system, easy no matter what kind of game you\u2019re playing.         \nAnd of course, there\u2019s all those new additions from Numenera Discovery and Destiny that add a lot of new options that just make the game better. They\u2019re not really changes, they\u2019re additions\u2014new character abilities, more choices, player intrusions in addition to GM intrusions, and more. These will all be incorporated into the new CSR. And let me say again, it\u2019s still all entirely compatible with existing Cypher System material, whether it be from the CSR or one of our settings like Gods of the Fall, Predation, or Unmasked (and of course, Numenera and The Strange).\nFurther, we\u2019ll also be incorporating suggestions from Your Best Game Ever directly into this book. So, for example, Your Best Game Ever will talk about creating character arcs to enhance play, while the specific material for creating Cypher System character arcs as a mechanic will be included in this book.\nLastly, we\u2019ll include even more genres you can use, in addition to fantasy, horror, and so on. We\u2019re going to break science fiction into hard sci-fi and space opera/science fantasy, and we\u2019ll add coverage for romance, historical gaming, and more!

Your pledge is a down payment for an order to be placed, at a retail-friendly discount, when Your Best Game Ever and the revised Cypher System Rulebook are ready to ship. You can choose as many copies as you like of the books individually. You\u2019ll pay for your order (less your $80 deposit) at that time. It is likely (but not guaranteed) that you will get them ahead of street date, and you are welcome to begin selling them immediately. In addition to those books, you get a free deluxe Your Best Game Ever PoP kit. MCG covers domestic US shipping.\nYou might be wondering, \u201cHow do I select an add-on?\u201d It\u2019s easy. Select the Manage Your Pledge button on the right-hand side of the Kickstarter page and increase your pledge for the amount listed for the add-on. For example, if you want Early Playtest Access, add $100 to your pledge. It\u2019s that easy. After the campaign closes, we\u2019ll be using a service called Backerkit to collect your information, and at that time you can specify the add-on that you\u2019ve already paid for.  \nWhy does Monte Cook Games use Kickstarter to fund so many of its projects? In a word, you. You're reading this right now on Kickstarter because you're an invested game fan interested in what's new and innovative in gaming\u2014and thus you're exactly who we write our products for. If MCG were a company that made its way by publishing just another adventure or just another sourcebook every few months, we would have a hard time justifying Kickstarter. But that isn't our passion. Our passion is innovation and creation, but that requires up-front capital and\u2014probably even more importantly\u2014a test of the audience to determine if our ideas meet people's needs and wants. Kickstarter provides us with that. In turn, it puts us in a position to reward those early adopters with great deals, early access, and transparency. We think it's a win-win for everyone. But we use traditional sales channels as well, so if you'd like to check out some of our other products, like Numenera, The Strange, or Invisible Sun, you can go to our online store or visit your favorite local game retailer.         \nSoon after the Your Best Game Ever Kickstarter campaign ends, we will invite you to review your pledge on BackerKit. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add anything that you might have missed.         \nWhile we use BackerKit to organize backers, pledges, and add-ons, we don\u2019t fulfill rewards through them. Instead, your rewards from this Kickstarter campaign will be fulfilled through the MCG Shop, which puts you, the backer, in charge of redeeming them at your convenience.\nHere\u2019s how it works: when your rewards are ready, we\u2019ll notify you by email to check your MCG Shop account, which will be updated with coupons that let you redeem your rewards for free through our online store. You decide when to use the coupon, at which time we'll ask you to provide or update your shipping address. If you have multiple rewards coming, you may delay redemption of your rewards to bundle them together into one shipment to save on shipping costs. We guarantee a product will be in stock for you as one of your rewards for at least one year after the product's release date. This applies to all methods of shipping described below.\nIf you move between reward shipments, you won\u2019t need to tell us, since you\u2019ll simply enter your new address the next time you redeem a reward. If this is a gift and you want to ship it directly to the recipient, simply enter the recipient\u2019s shipping address as the Ship To address when you redeem your reward.\nDOMESTIC SHIPPING We offer USPS basic shipping within the United States for free. If you\u2019re super-eager to get your rewards, you can upgrade to a higher shipping class, but you\u2019ll be charged accordingly at the time of fulfillment.\nSHIPPING WITHIN THE UNITED KINGDOM, EUROPE, AUSTRALIA, AND NEW ZEALAND Your reward will be filled by our shipping center in the UK. The cost of shipping is not included in your pledge\u2014it will be an additional charge for you. However, it will be much less expensive than paying for shipping from the US to you.\nThe UK shipping center ships to the following countries: Austria, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.\n\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING International shipping is not included in your pledge. (Backers in the UK, Europe, Australia, or New Zealand: please refer to the previous section, above.)\nInternational shipping is expensive. We don\u2019t have any control over that, and we can\u2019t accurately predict what shipping rates will be at the time of fulfillment. If you\u2019re an international backer and have questions about shipping rates, we recommend you visit the USPS website to get an estimate. Please also be aware that you are responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.\nIf you have multiple items coming as rewards, you can mitigate shipping costs by waiting to have several of them shipped together. We guarantee that each reward will be available for a minimum period of one year from its official release date.\nTo ease the burden of international shipping costs, we subsidize all non-UK/Europe international customer orders and backer reward fulfillment orders with a $10 discount. You\u2019ll pay the shipping costs at the time of fulfillment, minus the $10 discount, which is automagically (and invisibly) applied through the inner workings of the MCG Shop (you won\u2019t see the discount reflected on your order, but it is applied to all international orders outside of the UK/Europe). In other words, if the cost to ship the parcel to you is $62 USD, you\u2019ll pay $52 USD. The $10 shipping discount is applied once per parcel, not per item.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the twelfth Kickstarter campaign for Monte Cook Games. All of our previous campaigns have been successful and jam-packed with rewards. Most of those campaigns are completely fulfilled, and we have a strong record for fulfilling rewards on time\u2014we\u2019ve delivered over 250,000 rewards to date. These include such varied items as corebooks for Numenera and The Strange, leather-bound deluxe corebooks, boxed sets, almost two-dozen hardcover supplements, signed bookplates, playtest access, special-access seminars, meetings and dinners with the creative team, online and in-person games, and so much more.\n\nThus, while there are always challenges that can arise, we've probably already faced them.\n\nWe are extremely proud of our track record.

Corey\u2019s award-winning series of science fiction novels to the tabletop. Using the Adventure Game Engine (AGE) rules found in Fantasy AGE, Blue Rose, and Modern AGE, The Expanse takes players to a far-future solar system where humanity is divided: Martians, Belters, and the people of old Earth struggle for political power and resources, but even older, alien, forces are stirring in the universe, and human history is about to take an unexpected new turn. The Expanse applies the fast-playing and action-based AGE rules to spaceships, solar colonies, and adventure and intrigue in the far-future, where the actions of the characters may change the course of history!\nAs long time fans know, The Expanse was a roleplaying game campaign long before it was a series of novels or a TV show. We are delighted to bring it full circle with this game! And here's the best thing about The Expanse RPG: we've been working on this for well over a year and rules are done! They've been through multiple iterations and playtesting, and we've worked closely with Ty Franck and Daniel Abraham (together, James S.A. Corey) throughout to ensure we are getting The Expanse right. Now let's hear from Daniel and Ty themselves!\nPLAY\n\nWant to check the game out RIGHT NOW? Download The Expanse RPG Quickstart today! This is a 40-page PDF that includes stripped down rules, pre-generated characters, and an adventure you can play right away. The download is free. \nThe Expanse RPG Features \nThe Expanse is based on the exciting new Modern AGE rules-set, and includes many of its features, such as customized character building using Backgrounds and Professions, Drives for character engagement, and an abstract resources system. It also makes use of the Modern AGE approach to action, exploration, and social encounters, complete with stunts and systems for all of them. To get a closer look at Modern AGE, you can download the Quickstart here.   \nThe following are some of the unique features of The Expanse in comparison to other AGE games:  \nFortune: Rather than Health, characters have a Fortune score that measures lucky near-misses, close scrapes, and trivial hits before the character takes serious harm. Fortune is also useful for modifying die rolls and offering players some narrative control but, watch out! Spend too much of it and your luck could run out when you get caught in a crossfire!\nConditions: In addition to a running Fortune total, characters use various conditions to measure things like injuries and fatigue as well as tactical challenges like hindered movement or sensory abilities.  \nInterludes: The interludes in between encounters are given their own treatment, allowing players to make use of their \u201cdown-time\u201d (including long hauls between destinations in the System) to recover, do maintenance, build their connections with others, or pursue their own projects.  \nSpaceships: The Expanse RPG features a system to model and create spaceships and its own system for space combat, including the assault on Thoth Station as an example of the system in action!  \nThe Churn: The Expanse also offers something for the Game Master with the Churn: A ticking counter that measures the crew\u2019s progress through a story and just when things are going to suddenly go sideways and become even more complicated!\nTwo Editions to Choose From!\nWe are offering the core rulebook of the Expanse RPG in two formats:\nThe Standard Edition is now (thanks to unlocked stretch goals) a 224 page full color hardback with a poster map of the solar system. This is the version that will stay in print after the Kickstarter has been fulfilled. \nThe Special Edition is a deluxe version of The Expanse RPG. It features the same beautiful full color interior of the Standard Edition with a black leatherette hardcover and a ribbon bookmark. This version is a Kickstarter exclusive, so it will not be available after the close of this campaign. Thanks to an unlocked stretch goal, the Special Edition now includes a dust jacket featuring the game's gorgeous cover art!\nThe Expanse Game Master's Kit\nThis Kickstarter also includes The Expanse Game Master's Kit, which will ship alongside the book. It currently includes the following, but may expand with the unlocking of stretch goals:\nA three-panel landscape format GM Screen with vital game system reference tables on one side and three panels of Expanse art on the player-facing side.  \nA set of game reference cards, including an initiative tracker, stunt references, and action references useful for players at the table.\nNow includes pre-generated characters after a stretch goal unlock!\nNow includes an adventure after a stretch goal unlock!\nAbzu's Bounty\nAbzu's Bounty is the first campaign for The Expanse  Roleplaying Game. This series of six linked scenarios will let you kick off your adventures in The Expanse in style. All six parts were unlocked as stretch goals so the full campaign is a go! Best of all, if you back the Kickstarter for $30 or more, you get a PDF of Abzu's Bounty for free! \n\nDesign Team\nWe assembled a great team to design The Expanse Roleplaying Game. Steve Kenson is the lead designer. You may know Steve from our Blue Rose and Mutants & Masterminds RPGs, or from any of the dozens of RPG books he's worked on over the last two decades. He had the able assistance of Seth Johnson, Ian Lemke, Rich Lescouflair, Rob McCreary, Jason Mical, Neall Raemonn Price, Zack Walters, Nicole Winchester, and of course James S.A. Corey!\n\nImportant Note: Shipping!  \nWe are going to be charging shipping separately later this year when the books are almost ready, and it will be EU-, Canada-, and Australia-friendly. In our previous Kickstarters, we tried to keep it simple with just a few standard shipping costs but this has proved a poor way to handle it. International shipping can be brutal and in too many cases we were paying more to ship than we collected for it. Shipping rates can also rise after a campaign ends but before the games are ready to ship. So about a month from shipping, we will assess and collect actual shipping costs using a pledge manager. The upside is that you don\u2019t need to pay the full cost now. We also want to point out that The Expanse RPG Standard Edition will be sold through distribution and into game and book stores after backers get their books. If you are concerned that shipping is going to be too expensive, be aware that the Kickstarter will not be the only way you can get the game. If you can get it from your local game store and save yourself a lot on shipping, that\u2019s a totally reasonable decision to make. There are also special tiers of the Kickstarter for retailers, so you can also talk to your local store and find out if they'll be bringing in books that way.\nGamers and retailers may also be interested in our Pre-Order Plus Program. Basically, this lets gamers pre-order our games through their local stores and get the same special we offer on our website. You can find out more about Pre-Order Plus here. \nStretch Goals\nOur initial batch of stretch goals are focused on enhancing the core rulebook and GM's Kit, make them bigger and better. \nUnlocked!

Build characters with familiar races akin to some found in popular media like runekin (master weaponsmiths with an earthy appearance and giant swords), fiari (desert-dwelling thieves and sorcerers with red hair and a flare for the dramatic), and tsura (who commonly dwell in water, offering aid to young heroes).\nArbiters, dalits, skaldaks, and swarmborn make for some curious, nonstandard races.\nDragon souls, god-blooded, and nephilim bring the power of gods and other great beings to bear.\nDwarrow, dworgs, and elflings hail from a dark realm ruled by a fallen god.\nWorld Soul dragonkin, dwarves (bronzemane, ironfire, and wildhill), elves (high, sun, moon, shadow, and star), tech gnomes, minotaurs (bison-fur, elk-horn, and eternal-flame), tieflings (exiled and star-forged), and trollkin (forest) celebrate their MMO counterparts with interesting abilities and traits.\nMinotaurs, leonin (lions), leporine (rabbits), sokari (unicorns), and ursaren (bears) round out a few other anthropomorphic races.\nDryants, manussos, mushroom leshys, xendauni\nThe accelerist (Volume 1) is a fast, active hero who can speed through the battlefield, taking opponents down quickly using velocity.\n                                                                                                                                                        Want to play one of 18+ new classes, including alternate, base, and hybrid classes? Speed through your enemies as an accelerist, take their power for yourself as a battle augur.\nPractice the forbidden arts as an invoker or necromancer.\nHybrids like convokers (paladin/summoner), darkseekers (cleric/rogue), d\u00falra (cleric/druid) and monster tamers (druid/monster trainer) find new ways to experience their parent classes as one solid concept.\nGenerational heroes, midnight legates (inquisitor/range), nature wardens (druid/fighter), truenamers, and witchblades (paladin/witch) take ideas from other editions and sources and expand on them.\nAstrologers (constellation magic), gamers (complex roleplaying and immersion), heirs apparent (wealth as a resource), potentialists (don't move!), and pythia (spontaneous druids) fill in strange concepts requested by fans and made into entertaining new options.\nArchetypes and class options offer a variety of new ways to play both new and classic character classes.\n                                                                           Play a wolf heart ranger, whose expertise lies in alchemy and specialized sigils he can use to create effects that help in battle. Maybe you draw your accelerist powers from time rather than speed as a time render. As a pious thief, you can worship the almighty coin. You could even become a skiprock champion!\nNumerous racial archetypes bring new ways to play as the race and class you want. Including: Archons and bull king's warriors (nephilim arcanists and barbarians), blessed apothecary (farrealmer alchemists), fury warrior (world soul barbarians) monk of the hidden continent (ursaren monks), mushroom knight (leshy fighters), sorcerer thane (fiari magus), and trash witch (dalit witches).\nAt least 1 archetype for every new class, and several for existing classes. These include: necrolyte, predator, and shapeless druids, rangers of the dark path, sanguine gunman gunslingers, time render accelerists, troubadour bards, twin blade generational heroes, vengeful spirit mediums, and wolf heart rangers.\nConvergence (introduced in Volume 1) lets you take a different heroic path during character progression.\n                                                                       The character options chapter in each volume includes other ways to customize a character beyond just class and level. Convergence, for example, allows you to trade some of the gold you would usually gather each level to take a heroic path and change yourself thematically, such as making you more devilish, draconic, of fey-like.\nConvergences also interact with some classes (such as the heir apparent) and magical locations (see below).\nFeats fill in the blanks on characters in different ways. From becoming a masterful assassin to experiencing new multiclassing options.\n Each volume contains a number of new spell lists (for the classes that require them) and new spells that offer opportunities for characters to study different methods of magical use.\nMagic items and equipment give characters new ways to deal with their enemies in combat, travel, or learn.\nIntroduced in volume 2, magical locations take an idea from back in D&D 3.5 edition and bring it to Pathfinder in new and exciting ways.\n Races like the dryant (dryad's who owe their lives to treants), manussos (constructs that absorb the consciousness of other creatures to grow stronger), and world soul dragonkin (dragon centaurs) have found their way into our exclusive content as we've unlocked new stretch goals.\nThe Dreamwalker class lets you explore the realm of dreams and use it to learn new, fantastic abilities quickly.\nVoted for by our backers so far are the life cycle guardians (druid and pythia) and the broom knight (cavalier) archetypes. Once we hit our next goal (150 backers), we can vote on another piece of content to guarantee, such as world soul ogres (a race that once ruled their world, sometimes have two heads), world soul dryants (dryant centaurs who guard the realm of dreams), the ventriloquist archetype (bard), model /s androids (small, armor and combat-loving androids), or some extra, new content for existing classes like necromancers and d\u00falra.\nBroom Knight art by Angusburger @DeviantArt\nThe different reward tiers are structured so that you can pick out the best individual option for you. If you want to get a single volume, you can simply pay the listed price and let us know in your survey which you want once the campaign finishes. If you want both, just double the price, and so forth. Any print copies distributed through the Kickstarter will be hardbound, premium print through Lightning Source and Drivethru RPG. \nVolume 1 is finished now. Volume 2 is available in PDF and expected in print around October. \nIt is stated in the rewards themselves, but Volume 2 is still being updated regularly. Once the campaign ends, anybody with a pdf reward for this volume will receive their link to the monthly update. Once the book reaches between 172 and 200 pages, we will finish cleaning it up and send it out for a proof copy to begin our print run for those looking to keep one on their bookshelves.\nVolume 2 offers playable options for characters based on other popular media.\nRequests for Additional Content and Art\nWe have a print proof ready to go out for Volume 1, but we can add up to 22 additional pages without having to change the layout. If anybody backs at a level where they can add content to volume 1, we will work with them to add it quickly once the campaign ends so we can adjust the print and reapprove it. If you're considering one of these tiers, please be available and ready to put in your request at the end.\nWe have more leeway for Volume 2, since it won't be sent to print before October, but the sooner we can get requests in for this, the sooner we can find an appropriate artist and put the content into the PDF.\nYou can get customized pages of content with a direct thanks to you on the same page!\nHow to Get an Add-On: If you have backed the project here or as part of our extended campaign on Drivethru RPG, you can reach out to me through a direct message on the Book of Many Things Facebook page or the Samurai Sheepdog website (www.samuraisheepdog.com) and we can discuss adding prints of any content (including the campaign exclusive book), or get you set up to join us for our Pathfinder 2 conversion group starting in August.\nAdditional Print on Demand Link ($10): Want to pick up another copy of either volume 1 or 2 as a gift for a friend or family member? You can buy multiple print on demand copies as an addon to any tier for $10 each. \nHard Cover Copy of the Campaign Exclusive Content ($10/$25): Want something truly exclusive to the Kickstarter? How about a Hard cover copy of all of the exclusive content we're putting together? We have enough content already planned (up to 100 pages) to make this a viable option, and each goal we meet from here on will only make it that much better. If you're looking to get a signed copy sent your way, $25 will do the trick.\nSignature Upgrade ($15 USD): If you would like to have a single volume signed and sent to you, you can do so by backing at any print on demand tier and adding $15 USD to cover the cost of shipping it to us so we can sign it and send it out to you. When we send out surveys, you can let us know what volume you want signed ($30 for both).\nThe Book of Many Things Volume 3 ($10-$15): We've been asked if the Book of Many Things will continue after Volume 2, to which we want to say resoundingly yes! If you've enjoyed the work we're doing here so far, you'll love what we have planned down the road. Even better, you can get in on the groundwork now for less than the final cost when it goes live in (planned) 2019. If you add $10 to any tier, you can let us know in the survey it's for volume 3 early buy-in. For $15, you can buy-in now for a print on demand code once that volume is finished as well. We figure most Kickstarters plan out to a year in advance, so this is our reach into that not-so-distant future. We'll look forward to seeing you then.\n We also hosted a Deal of the Day on Drivethru RPG for one of our other titles, which is being added to our final total and already reflected in the stretch goals above.\nAs a result of our efforts, we have so far reached 2 major stretch goals already. PCGen Support and a custom cover for the campaign exclusive content. Here's a link to check out the former, and a preview of the latter. *Cover subject to change as we get custom art completed.\nWe also have several other designers joining us as we meet the content goals, including:\nScott Gladstein: A green-tea fueled writing golem; Scott runs Little Red Goblin Games and has over a hundred published works to his name.

She likes to define herself as, \"a lot wizard, a little oracle, and a would-be bard\" (lately, also a Halfling Librarian), and the greatest challenge she deals with everyday now is finding time to write with an inquisitor of a husband and a little celestial bloodrager and dinosaur\u2013loving skald (Michele and Giorgio) in her life.

After two years of obsessive cooking and development in our private kitchen, Sichuan Chili Crisp is finally ready to make its debut outside of China with your help. \nOur goal is to harness Sichuan's legendary canon of flavors through our sauces and share them with the world, showcasing the cuisine's complexity beyond just 'spicy and numbing' and that \"Made in China\"can mean the highest quality products with no artificial flavors and preservatives.  \n  New York Magazine - A Chinese-Food Authority Is Bringing Her Chengdu-Made Chili Sauce to America \nSaveur - You Need This New High-end Chinese Chile Crisp \nDownload our press pack here \n    At the base of a great sauce lies \u9c9c xian, a.k.a. umami, or, the fifth taste.  Instead of using MSG as a shortcut, we draw it out naturally using the finest ingredients available.\nFlavor and function belong together\nWe believe that flavor and function should not be mutually exclusive.  \nSo our flavorful sauces are built with a blend of adaptogenic mushrooms, seaweeds and spices long known in China to have both flavor-building and healing properties. \nThis allows us to build deep umami flavors that are good for you as well, boosting immunity, energy, and longevity.\nIt's all about the ingredients\nTribute Pepper\nAt the heart of Sichuan Chili Crisp is Sichuan pepper, an ancient spice that has been cultivated in China for thousands of years that is responsible for the cuisine\u2019s unique tongue-tingling sensation. \nWe use a special variety called \u8d21\u6912 Gongjiao, also known as 'Tribute pepper', so prized it was once given exclusively as a tribute to the emperor, with a truly transformational smell and taste. They are painstakingly hand-harvested just once a year- and sell out immediately-, rarely making their way to the West.\nProudly crafted in Sichuan\nWe work with our co-packing partner in Sichuan to process our ingredients and craft our sauces, ensuring the highest quality control standards, food safety management, and strict compliance with FDA regulations.  We only source 100% all natural ingredients, and do not use any artificial flavor additives or preservatives. \nTogether, we're changing the notion of what \"Made in China\" can mean.\nThe result is a chili sauce that delivers the perfect level of spice and deep flavor that you can use the same way you would any other hot sauce.  It's spicy, numbing, crispy, and deliciously savory. How you eat it is completely up to you. \nWe dare you not to put it on everything.\nRead More About Us\n1.  SICHUAN CHILI CRISP\n\"Fly By Jing sauces are a game-changer \u2013 and not just for your food, but for the global image of Sichuan food as a whole. So much of Chinese cuisine is misunderstood in the Western world, but I believe we are on the cusp of a renaissance for its appreciation, starting with Sichuan cooking. Sichuan Chili Crisp is the perfect antidote to gloopy, artificial headaches like 'Szechuan Sauce;' it's made with authentic, natural ingredients hailing from the heart of the region, and will awaken your senses to real Chinese food.\"\n- Betty Richardson, Former Food Editor, That's Shanghai Magazine\n\u201cSichuan Chili Crisp is absolutely delicious, unique and versatile.

Be one of the first to get your hands on new season Tribute Pepper (painstakingly hand-harvested by farmers this August in the mountains of Sichuan), the smell and taste of which is transformational. Read our Sichuan Primer in Anthony Bourdain's Parts Unknown to learn why it is exceptionally rare to find fresh and high quality Sichuan pepper outside of China.\n  \u4e8c\u8346\u6761 Erjingtiao, the most popular variety of chili in Sichuan, is known for its mild spice but intense fragrance. It doesn\u2019t overwhelm the taste of a dish but instead heightens sensations and awakens the palate to deeper flavors. Its uses are varied and inventive: dry-fried in oil for a scorched-chili flavor; ground up and combined with aromatics to create the canvas for the most fragrant chili oils; and mixed with various other spices to make dozens of Sichuan flavor profiles.\n4.

The best doubanjiang comes from a county called Pixian just outside of Chengdu. Here, factories have been fermenting their paste for hundreds of years, traditionally in large clay pots that are left out under the sun and mixed by hand daily to evenly distribute its exposure to the elements.  The longer they are aged, the darker and more complex in flavor they become. Our 3 year doubanjiang is one of the best in existence, with deep umami flavors slowly built over time, completely natural with no additives, and largely unavailable outside of China.  \n6. MR. CHEN'S HANDMADE CLEAVERS\nMr. Chen has been a metalsmith for the last thirty years in the old village of Pengzhen outside of Chengdu. He makes a selection of cooking equipment and tools including woks, cleavers, pots and scissors.  Of these, our favorite is his carbon steel Chinese cleaver, one of the best multipurpose tools in the kitchen. Chinese cooks have traditionally used a single cleaver for every task in the kitchen from dicing, deboning, butchering to julienning. These measure about 170mm with a 105mm wooden handle. \n7.

This new book from Dreamscarred Press will provide everything you need to use psionic powers in your Starfinder RPG campaign.\nWhat's In It\nThe Psionics Guide will include the following material to expand your options in a Science Fantasy campaign:\nNew Races - 11 psionic races to choose from the curious astreidi, the insectoid dromites, the immortal elans, the serpentine ophiduan, to the powerful half-giants\nFour New Classes - the iconic Psion, the Aegis who shapes energy into armor and weapons, the Specialist who uses her psionic power to overcome obstacles, and the Integrator who joins minds together into vast neural networks\nNew Feats - new feats for the different psionic classes\nNew Archetypes - including a Wilder archetype and the Soulknife archetype, which use the Starfinder RPG archetype design\nPsionic Powers - with powers from 1st level to 6th level\nPsionic Equipment to outfit your character or augment their abilities\nNew Psionic Themes\nSample mock-up cover, not intended to be final cover\nWhy Kickstarter\nOur initial goal is to have enough funds to cover all artwork costs and fulfillment costs. If we exceed that, we're planning on expanding the book and adding some additional psionic content. \nThe Psionics Guide has already been written and is going through public playtesting to get reviews and feedback. What we need funds for is artwork and printing costs. If we want to get an affordable, traditional offset print run, we need to order at least 1000 copies of the hardcover to be cost effective. While we can go with on-demand printing, we still need to pay the authors and artists for their work. And a book of this size isn't cheap to create.\nStretch Goals\nIf we exceed our base funding, we have additional goals for higher funding.\n ACHIEVED! $6000 - Children of the Void: We'll add the Children of the Void motif to the Psionics Guide. This includes new character options and GM tools.\nACHIEVED! $7000 - Psionic Character Sheets: The current Starfinder RPG character sheets are great for the core classes. But they're geared toward spellcasters. Psionics works differently, so our goal would be to create character sheets with spots to record your power points, powers known, and other psionic abilities. These sheets will be provided as a PDF download to all backers at $10 and up.\nACHIEVED! $8500 - Raiders of the Endless Sea: We'll add the Raiders of the Endless Sea motif to the Psionics Guide. This includes new character options and GM tools.\nACHIEVED! $10000 - Bestiary! We will add a psionic creature book to the project! This will include new psionic monsters and new grafts of a psionic nature. The Bestiary will be a separate book, so as to not impact the completion and shipping of the Psionics Guide. For PDF-only backers, we will add a new $15 reward tier to get a PDF copy of the Psionics Guide and the Bestiary.\nACHIEVED! $12000 - Dreamwalkers: We'll add the Dreamwalkers motif to the Psionics Guide. This includes new character options and GM tools.\nACHIEVED! $14000 - Athanatism: The Athanatism discipline, the psionic art of manipulating souls and spirits, will be added to the Psionics Guide, along with new psionic powers, class options, and more.\nACHIEVED! $16000 - More Iconic Artwork: At this level, we will add more artwork for the iconic characters of the different psionic classes.\nACHIEVED! $18000 - Shadow Wars: The Shadow Wars motif will be added, detailing the spies, saboteurs, and revolutionaries of the psionic races, and the resources they use to hide and find information, manipulate extradimensional space, and get out alive to fight another day.\nACHIEVED! $20000 - Full Page Artwork: Artwork is one of the largest costs in creating a book this size. With this funding level, we'll add full-page images to the start of each chapter.\nACHIEVED! $22000 - Expanded Bestiary: At this level, we will add more psionic monsters and options to the Psionic Bestiary. While this will increase the page count, it will not change the price of the book for any add-on selections.\nACHIEVED! $24000 - Fleshwarping: The Fleshwarping motif details the modern practice of an ancient psionic tradition, including new augmentations, powers, and other player options.\nACHIEVED! $26000 - Additional Artwork: At this funding level, we will set aside additional funds for interior artwork in the book.\nACHIEVED! $28000 - Bringers of Peace: We will add the Bringers of Peace motif, which will give expanded information on the Noral Democratic Republic, the frenzied terraforming obsessions of the duergar, and the online culture of the Astreidi, including player options and GM tools.\n$30000 - Psionic Starships: If we reach this funding level we will write the Strangers' Armada supplement, detailing the starships of various psionic nations and organizations, the weapons and systems developed for them, and exploring the role of psionics and magic in starship combat.\n$32000 - The Lost Children:The Lost Children motif will be added, which includes examples of psionic societies that developed apart from their parent cultures such as lost Noral colonies, Ophiduan rebels, and the tools they developed.\nMore will be revealed as we reach higher funding levels!\nNOTE: The themes discussed for stretch goals do not refer to the Starfinder RPG term theme like the Ace Pilot, but instead a thematic group of character options and GM tools.\nBacker Stretch Goals\nNow that we have achieved initial funding, we have some bonuses based upon the number of backers for the project! This means if we have the number of backers indicated by the goal, that reward will be unlocked!\nREACHED! 150 backers - Mobile device wallpaper downloads\nREACHED! 200 backers - Each of the four classes will receive ONE reward for an iconic character design. Like the cover art reward, the character concept MUST be approved by Dreamscarred Press. Please check the FAQ for more details.\nREACHED! 250 backers - Desktop wallpaper downloads\nREACHED! 300 backers - Backers will get to vote on ONE additional psionic monster to be included in the Bestiary!\nREACHED! 350 backers - The Familiar Strangers motif will be added, incorporating the psionic traditions of many non-psionic races, as well as the powers and techniques they have developed and the history of psionics in cultures where it is more niche and less visible.\nREACHED! 400 backers - We will create a printable minis PDF of the iconic psionic characters. All backers at $10 and up will get this PDF.\nREACHED! 450 backers - We will create a printable minis PDF of the creatures from the Bestiary. All backers at $15 and up will get this PDF.\nREACHED! 500 backers - Backers will get to vote on a SECOND additional psionic monster to be included in the Bestiary!\nREACHED! 600 backers - We will add the Seekers in the Great Night motif, which will include content relevant to the mysteries of the psionic races, their colonies & outposts, and player/GM tools for 'frontier' stories.\n700 backers - We will produce an artwork PDF for all backers at $10 or higher.\nRewards\nBackers at $10 and higher will get rewards as our thanks of bringing this project to life! Since we cannot update reward selections once they've been chosen, we'll add to the list here if we reach stretch goals that add any additional rewards.\n$10 or higher - PDF of Psionics Guide, PDF of printable iconic minis, and PDF of psionic character sheet\n$15 or higher - PDF of Psionics Guide, PDF of printable iconic minis, PDF of psionic character sheet, PDF of Bestiary, and PDF of printable creature minis.\n$50 or higher - Standard full-color, hardcover copy and PDF of Psionics Guide, PDF of printable iconic minis, PDF of psionic character sheet, PDF of Bestiary, and PDF of printable creature minis.\n$100 or higher - Premium full-color, hardcover copy and PDF of Psionics Guide, PDF of psionic character sheet, PDF of printable iconic minis, PDF of Bestiary, and PDF of printable creature minis. See below for example of premium vs standard prints. \nStandard vs. premium printed books\nYou may be wondering what is the difference between the standard full-color hardcover book and the premium full-color hardcover book. Standard prints are done using our normal print-on-demand printing facility, using inkjet printing technology. Premium prints are done using more traditional offset printing processes, which are more expensive when done at smaller runs because of the setup cost. Premium prints will have more vibrant colors. Both use the same weight of paper.\nAdd-Ons  \nYou can increase your pledge to get additional rewards!  \n$45 - If you want additional copies of the Psionics Guide, add $45 for every standard additional copy you want.  \n$95 - If you're pledging at the $100 or higher tier, add $95 for every additional premium copy of the Psionics Guide you want.\nWith $10,000 in funding reached, we will also be producing a 64-page Bestiary of psionic monsters and grafts! All backers at $15 or higher get the PDF of the Bestiary as part of your rewards.\nIf you want a print copy, you can add the cost to your reward total based upon which version of the Bestiary you'd like: softcover full color, hardcover standard color, or hardcover premium color.\nSoftcover full color - add $25 to your pledge amount\nHardcover standard color - add $35 to your pledge amount\nHardcover premium color - add $50 to your pledge amount\nBecause the Psionics Guide may finish before the Bestiary is finished, we may ship these separately. For backers in the US, there is no additional shipping cost. For international backers, we will have an option in your survey to select if you want us to wait and bundle the two books or to invoice for the additional shipping costs. \nSample mock-up cover, not intended to be final cover\nFulfillment\nDigital downloads and printed book fulfillment will be done using DriveThruRPG. We've successfully used DriveThruRPG to distribute PDFs for our Patreon campaign, and we use DriveThruRPG's on-demand printing service for some order fulfillment already, so it only makes sense for us to continue to use them for this project.

This is Everyman Gaming's second Kickstarter and Rogue Genius Games's fourth; our team is experienced in crowdfunding and publishing. We know what we're doing. Everyman Gaming started this year publishing a 1,000 words or more of Third-Party Pathfinder Roleplaying Game content every week, and has continued this trend until August 17th, at which point we began releasing two products a week for a total of 2,000 or more words. Both Everyman Gaming and Rogue Genius Games are 5-Star Third-Party Publishers with plenty of experience.\n\nThe primary risk for the Starfarer's Skill Guide is our author (Alex Augunas) or artist (Jacob Blackmon) being struck by some major illness or injury. In such a scenario, we're prepared to reach out to friends and contacts throughout the industry, from Rogue Genius Games and belong, to complete this project in as timely of a manner as possible.\n\nCurrently, all of the words for the funded level of this book are written; they just need to be developed and edited once or twice each. This is due to the Advanced Skill Guide's status as a compilation and conversion product of sorts. As additional stretch goals are unlocked, however, we may need additional time to get the content written, and will certainly need time to get the art finished.\n\nAnother potential challenge could arise from backers who wish to have character illustrations included in the Advanced Skill Guide if they aren't quick to communicate with Jacob or Akex. Backers who pledge at those levels must deliver text promptly, and it will be developed as quickly as possible. We will not hold up the project due to lack of submission, however.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Patron", "descp": "[BASIC]\nINCLUDES:\nOur sincerest thanks.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2018"}], "stat": ["5 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Recognized Patron", "descp": "[BASIC]\nINCLUDES:\nOur sincerest thanks.\nYour name on the \"Thank You to Our Backers\" page.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2018"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Digital Patron", "descp": "[BASIC]\nINCLUDES:\nOur sincerest thanks.\nYour name on the \"Thank You to Our Backers\" page.\nA PDF copy of the Advanced Skill Guide upon public release.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2018"}], "stat": ["39 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "Print Patron", "descp": "[BASIC]\nINCLUDES:\nOur sincerest thanks.\nYour name on the \"Thank You to Our Backers\" page.\nA Print OD copy of the Advanced Skill Guide upon public release.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2018"}], "stat": ["9 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "Star Log.EM Digital Patron", "descp": "[ADVANCED]\nINCLUDES:\nOur sincerest thanks.\nYour name on the \"Thank You to Our Backers\" page.\nA Print OD copy of the Advanced Skill Guide upon public release.\nEvery Star Log-EM series product in 2017 (EM-001 through EM-019).\nA PDF copy of the Advanced Skill Guide upon public release.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2018"}], "stat": ["45 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "Bundled Patron", "descp": "[BASIC]\nINCLUDES:\nOur sincerest thanks.\nYour name on the \"Thank You to Our Backers\" page.\nA Print OD copy of the Advanced Skill Guide upon public release.\nA PDF copy of the Advanced Skill Guide upon public release.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2018"}], "stat": ["7 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "Star Log.EM Print Patron", "descp": "[ADVANCED]\nINCLUDES:\nOur sincerest thanks.\nYour name on the \"Thank You to Our Backers\" page.\nEvery Star Log-EM series product in 2017 (EM-001 through EM-019).\nA Print OD copy of the Advanced Skill Guide upon public release.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2018"}], "stat": ["4 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "Celebrity Patron", "descp": "[ADVANCED]\nINCLUDES:\nOur sincerest thanks.\nYour name on the \"Thank You to Our Backers\" page.\nA PDF copy of the Advanced Skill Guide upon public release.\nYour Core Race character will be illustrated in the book.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2018"}], "stat": ["2 backers", "Limited (2 left of 4)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "Star Log.EM Bundled Patron", "descp": "[ADVANCED]\nINCLUDES:\nOur sincerest thanks.\nYour name on the \"Thank You to Our Backers\" page.\nA PDF copy of the Advanced Skill Guide upon public release.\nA Print OD copy of the Advanced Skill Guide upon public release.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2018"}], "stat": ["8 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Literal Patron", "descp": "[ADVANCED]\nINCLUDES:\nOur sincerest thanks.\nYour name on the \"Thank You to Our Backers\" page.\nA PDF copy of the Advanced Skill Guide upon public release.\nA Print OD copy of the Advanced Skill Guide upon public release.\nA 1,000 word Star Log will be designed on a topic of your choice.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2018"}], "stat": ["0 backers", "Limited (5 left of 5)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Consultee", "descp": "[ADVANCED]\nINCLUDES:\nOur sincerest thanks.\nYour name on the \"Thank You to Our Backers\" page.\nA PDF copy of the Advanced Skill Guide upon public release.\nA Print OD copy of the Advanced Skill Guide upon public release.\n1 hour of consultation time with Alexander Augunas.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2018"}], "stat": ["0 backers", "Limited (1 left of 1)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "Foreign Celebrity Patron", "descp": "[ADVANCED]\nINCLUDES:\nOur sincerest thanks.\nYour name on the \"Thank You to Our Backers\" page.\nA PDF copy of the Advanced Skill Guide upon public release.\nYour character (any race) will be illustrated for the book.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2018"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "1 backer"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #19", "update_userinfo": "Belated Final Update and Contact Info!", "update_content": "Hello, backers!\nIt came to our attention that we never actually posted an update signifying that the print books were out in the opening.

Seeking to win the minds of the people by a grand gesture during these dark times, Emperor Hitoshi Masuto has arranged an alliance between the quarreling noble families\u201420 brides and grooms have been chosen to wed in celebration of the 10th anniversary of the decisive final battle in the rebellion against more than a century of foreign occupation.\nWhether the adventurers seek honor and glory by protecting these fiancees or choose to line their pockets by ensuring the unions never come to pass, opportunity knocks at their door as the bengoshi of several clans sift through the mercenaries and spellswords that walk the streets of Sanbaoshi for the most capable agents. To rise above the chaff in the capital of the Imperial Prefecture the PCs must be willing to do whatever is necessary to achieve their goals and survive among their cutthroat competition, the corrupting Mists of Akuma, and any designs of the monstrous forces keen to strike a foothold anew in Soburin. \nImperial Matchmaker's cover by Renan Moraes\nThe Imperial Matchmaker sandbox mega adventure for 5E is a full color hardcover book that takes characters from 4th through 10th level as they try to stop the disruption of Emperor Hitoshi's decreed nuptials\u2014or use the grand events to gain glory, fame, and power in the disparate lands of Soburin. Throughout the adventure PCs explore the richly detailed imperial capital of Sanbaoshi while fighting off adeddo-oni emerging from the Mists of Akuma and discovering the subplots woven into the module for their characters, each one of them unique and distinct from their mercenary peers.\nCover of the softcover iconics book by Sara Shijo\nEach illustrated by world class artist Claudio Pozas!!! (www.claudiopozas.com)\nThe challenges facing the adventurers in Imperial Matchmaker are as difficult as they are diverse and to truly embody the Mists of Akuma campaign setting we've made 8 special pregenerated characters for players to utilize. Groups making their own PCs (character sheets \u2192 ink-friendly) get guidelines inside of Imperial Matchmaker: Guests on how to include special features like the iconics, and then the GM can use these characters instead as rival NPCs with builds at 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th level! \nAyakashi, Performer Extraordinaire - A noh theater mask turned into a tsukumogami able to possess those who wear it to travel freely in society.\nKanden, Last Shinobi of the Jitsuri-Teki - Undead haunted still by his ancestors (both soldiers from distant Ropaeo and murdered soburi ninja) that seeks solace before his ancient augmetics give out.\nLan, Self-Proclaimed Immortal - Saru hengeyokai thief with a penchant for machinery, collapsible staff, cursed headband, and secrets galore.\nMatsi Tsunamo, Private Eye for Hire - Magic dice wielding urban tanuki detective seeking the answer to a mystery beneath Sanbaoshi.\nNatsuko Hibike, Kamispeaker - Soburi cleric accompanied by her family's powerful spirit, a strange snake kami named Hibe.\nPiasu, Haiiro-Nokishi Battle Brother - Machine-armored hobgoblin er\u012btokir\u0101 warrior with a mission from his Chapter Master and a debt to the black-smoke dragon Ahench\u016bdoku.\nRinna, the R\u014dsoku-Urasan - Tengu warlock from the future that uses her ancestors as her patron, seeking to upend a terrible fate for the world.\nTomoe Masamune, the Crimson Blade - Soburi samurai in Sanbaoshi seeking to reclaim the dignity stripped away after her lord amputated her for defying his word (a limb replaced now by the steam arm tsukumogami Zenry\u014dna).\nFor GMs and players that seek to travel beyond the bounds of Sanbaoshi we're making the Mists of Akuma: Trade War adventure path, a hardcover book that collects and expands on the existing six Mists of Akuma adventures! These highly-rated modules will include new antagonists ranging from smuggler guilds to subversive shinobi clans in an epic tale crafted by shinnichi (japanophile) Duan Byrd that traverses the whole of Soburin. More information, video walkthroughs, and PDF previews of the adventures are on DriveThruRPG but for a quick rundown:\nScourge of R\u00f3bai Shita Temple (3rd-4th) is an isolated mountain village mystery and dungeon crawl.\nFeud Primordial (5th level) is a mystery adventure across several prefectures and the river city of Nesuto. \nFangs of Revenge (6th-7th level) Duplicitous intrigue and a deep mystery in a railroad town.\nCursed Soul of the Scorpion Samurai (7th level) Covert journeys, zombie pandemonium, and a chase after a murderous anti-hero.\nYai Sovereign of Storms (7th-8th level) Discover the oni city of Tsukisasu and influence who rules over the secret settlement. \nRevenge of the Pale Master (8th-10th level) An epic adventure delving into the dark past of Kizaki and the bloody abattoir of its true master.\nAn eastern fantasy noir steampunk campaign setting for 5E funded on Kickstarter in 2016. Think Edo-era Japan + Ravenloft + Warhammer 40,000 or Afro Samurai + Onimusha + Sin City. \nOwning the Mists of Akuma core book is not required to play through Imperial Matchmaker, but both it and the Adventurer's Handbook are available as pledge rewards and add-ons for GMs that want the whole package.\nThe Mists of Akuma are an ancient and primordial fog that re-emerged not long after the people of Soburin threw down the oppressors of the Kengen Occupation. Exposure to the supernatural haze corrupts living things, robbing them of their dignity and virtue until they are completely transformed into adeddo-oni\u2014deadly, swift, zombified perversions of who they once were. Even inanimate objects are not immune to its effects, artificially aged at a rapid pace and possibly becoming monstrous tsukumogami in the process! This is a complete campaign setting of two dozen prefectures with 14 new races, archetypes for all classes (including a paladin samurai and wu-jen warlock), martial arts feats, two attributes that help define characters in the world (Dignity and Haitoku or \u201cfall from virtue\u201d), majestic imperial dragons, a treasure trove of oni, and more. \nPledge levels at $100 and below offer at-cost print vouchers.

NeoExodus Legacies uses the structure set forth in the NeoExodus Campaign Guide. If you are a fan of another organized play setting like Pathfinder Society, Living Forgotten Realms, Living Greyhawk, Living City and other living, organized play or  RPGA run campaigns, NeoExodus Legacies would be of interest to you.\nThere are several types of adventures in NeoExodus Legacies: \nKeystones, which include major plot points. One or two key decisions made in each keystone adventures will be tracked by GM, and turned in as part of the Legacy Record for the adventure. Keystones will be aimed for a 4 hour retail and convention time window. Each keystone has a Legacy Record, which tracks key decisions, Patron Favor earned, and a Patreon Favors called in. \nEpisodes, which are for lack of a better term \u201cfiller\u201d, which does not advance the main plot in any significant way. Interactives will be aimed for a 4-hour retailer and convention time window. Each interactive has a Legacy Record, which tracks Patron Favor earned, and a Patreon Favors called in. \nSide-Treks, which are additional information for players. They are short, mini-episodes that provide players information and focus particularly around a single roleplaying encounter. Each side-trek has a Legacy Sheet that informs that the player has completed it, and offers them a small, one-time boon that can be used in a future adventure. \nSeasonal Events, specialized Vault based raids and mini-campaigns that are tied to a specific date or time for example Hallow\u2019s Eve (Runs from the week to 10 days before Halloween and a week after Halloween); New Dawning (Runs from the week to 10 days before Christmas and a week after New Year's Day); Renewal (Runs from the week to 10 days before Easter and a week after Easter); Unification (Runs from the week to 10 days after Origins and a week before Gen Con).\nAdditionally, there are going to be 3 different levels of \u201cfocus\u201d for adventures. A = Keystone adventures related to the storyline of the year; B = Keystone adventures that set up next year's main story adventures; C = Episodes that do not directly relate to the main plot.\nLevel Brackets \nIn a similar vein to Pathfinder Society, characters will not level up based on traditional experience points but instead based on the number of scenarios they have completed. The iconics are level 3 and 5, making that our baseline for year 0, and the starting point for year 1.\nEvery NeoExodus Legacies adventure grants participating characters a number of experience points. Those experience points are not given based solely on combat and challenge rating of the creatures within the adventure. In fact, some adventures may be completed without any combat at all.\nAdventures grant between 1 and 9 experience points, with most adventures giving 3. Some may give more, while others may give less. Each adventure will detail how to give out experience points, and how many can be gained.\nEvery time a character reaches a multiple of 9 experience points, he goes up one level.\nOn average, an adventure planned for four hours (a regular convention time slot) will give you 3 experience points. A side trek (1-2h) will give you 1 experience point. A full module (such as Cold Visitor) may give up to 9 experience points.\nWho are the PCs?  \nAll PCs, no matter race, class or creed are members of the Alliance Freelancers. The Alliance Freelancers are theoretically mercenaries, but working under the collective direction of the Crown Council, who together work for the betterment of the Imperial Alliance. At least, in theory. The reality is much more complex. As the Freelancers come from all over Exodus, and even other worlds, their loyalties are divided at best and even sometimes opposed. Even when they are working directly for the Crown Council, as they often are, each member of the council have their own ulterior motives that often oppose those of other members - and these motives translate directly to sub-missions for the PCs. \nFactions \nThere are six dominant factions in NeoExodus Legacies. Each faction is represented by one or more Patrons.

It is an open-world survival tabletop RPG with art by legendary Swedish fantasy artist Nils Gulliksson and the masterful Simon St\u00e5lenhag, lore by acclaimed fantasy author and game writer Erik Granstr\u00f6m and game design by the Free League team that brought you Mutant: Year Zero, Coriolis: The Third Horizon and Tales from the Loop RPG.\nIn Forbidden Lands, the player characters are not heroes sent on missions dictated by others - instead, they are raiders and rogues bent on making their own mark on a cursed world. They will discover lost tombs, fight terrible monsters, wander the wild lands and, if they live long enough, build their own stronghold to defend.\nThe glorious boxed set with two books and a large full-color map will give players freedom to hexcrawl the world the way they want while still taking part in an epic campaign that will, in the end, let them decide the fate of the Forbidden Lands. Also, the unique rules for exploration, survival, basebuilding and campaign play can easily be ported to your own favorite game world.\nIn Swedish? Sj\u00e4lvklart kommer \u201cGullikssonspelet\u201d \u00e4ven p\u00e5 svenska, med arbetstiteln \u00c4rans v\u00e4g. Denna kickstarter g\u00e4ller \u00e4ven den svenska utg\u00e5van - du kan v\u00e4lja vilket spr\u00e5k du vill ha efter kickstarterns slut. Och - om du var backer i kickstartern f\u00f6r Nils Gullikssons konstbok f\u00f6rra \u00e5ret f\u00e5r du automatiskt detta spel i PDF-format.\nNils Gulliksson's art enthralled a generation of Swedish kids in the 1980s. For many, he was - and still is - the fantasy artist. His iconic gritty inked style showed a down-to-earth yet wondrous brand of classic fantasy archetypes. Now, thirty years later, these illustrations will come to life as never before. Forbidden Lands will contain both classic art pieces and new work by Gulliksson.\nSo, what do we mean by a retro RPG? In Forbidden Lands, you will play raiders and rogues in an unforgiving world, but what you do is up to you. RPGs from the late \u201970s and early \u201880s often had this open approach to adventuring. You were free to roam a map and discover its secrets and treasures. This is something we aim to recapture - with the support of modern game mechanics. The sandbox approach to gaming gives the players the freedom to make their mark on the game world however they want - if they can survive long enough to tell the tale.\nThe aestethics and art style of the game is also influenced by retro gaming and the iconic work of Nils Gulliksson. The books themselves will have a handcrafted, old look like old tomes from the Forbidden Land itself!\nStill, Forbidden Lands is a modern game, based on the award winning rules and mechanics from Mutant: Year Zero and Tales from the Loop - and taking them to the next level. In this game, we aim to merge the best of the old and the new to create a fresh, exciting fantasy RPG unlike anything you have seen before.\n  The core game setting of Forbidden Lands is a vast and remote valley once known as Ravenland, conquered by the spellbinder Zygofer over three centuries ago. When faced by the savage orcs, he opened dark gates to seek the help of demons. That was his undoing. Zygofer was lost to the darkness and he placed himself on the throne of the Ravenland, his daughter Therania by his side.\nTo keep their vile corruption from spreading, the king in the south built a great wall across the mountain pass and forbade all to ever speak of what had happened. Since that day, the spellbinder\u2019s domain is known as the Forbidden Lands. Zygofer's henchmen, the feared Rust Brothers, still haunt the land, but the spellbinder himself has not been seen for many years. Fearful whispers say he has transformed into a demonic creature called Zytera.\nToday, the Forbidden Lands it is a lawless place where demons and dark creatures roam the countryside, while common folk barricade themselves in small villages. Only the brave and the foolish, the raiders and the rogues, dare venture out to seek treasure and glory in the ruins of old.\nWritten by acclaimed fantasy author Erik Granstr\u00f6m, the Forbidden Lands setting is rich and detailed, on the surface based on classic fantasy but with many surprising twists and secrets to discover during play. However, the game does not require the players to learn any lore at all before starting to play. Instead, the intriguing history of the Forbidden Lands is discovered piece by piece during play using a system of so-called legends.\n  The rules of the Forbidden Lands are built on the award-winning Year Zero engine, used in Mutant: Year Zero, Tales from the Loop RPG, and Coriolis - The Third Horizon. The core system uses a dice pool system based on six-sided dice - but Forbidden Lands uses D8s, D10s and D12s as well, for powerful artifacts and magic items.\nSurvival in the wild is at the core of this game. As in Mutant: Year Zero, the characters\u2019 attributes will degrade if they do not strike camp and find food. Combat is fast and furious, and the melee combat system has been greatly expanded with a range of tactical options that will make sure that no two combats are ever the same. Magic is wild, dangerous and unpredictable.\nA limited set of attributes and skills makes character generation quick, while a comprehensive range of talents provide mechanical depth and development opportunities. Talents are tiered to provide even more variation and progression options.\n  The beautiful game map by Tobias Tranell, showing the Forbidden Land in all its glory, is the centerpiece of the game. The map is devided into 10 different terrain types, and uses an hexagonal grid to regulate movement.\nUsing the map, players can go anywhere they like and explore the world the way they want. The modular way the campaign is built using adventure sites (more on those below) allows the GM to make sure the players don't miss the story without any need for leading them by the nose.\nFast but effective rules regulate travel, scouting, foraging, hunting, striking camp, resting, etc, giving every character in the party a role to play during travels. The game also contains a system for generating hazards as well as thrilling encounters for the GM to throw at the players.\nStickers & Legacy Map: Additionally, we will make custom stickers for key events and adventure sites, and even the graves of killed player characters! Placing the stickers on the game map, you transform it to a living, unique document of your campaign. (The map will be double-sided to allow for replay.)\n  In Forbidden Lands, adventure sites are scenario locations that can be placed wherever the GM wants on the game map. The adventure sites are divided into the three categories - Village, Castle and Dungeon - and symbols for these three categories can be found in many hexes on the game map. For example, when the player characters venture close to a village on the map, the GM chooses which adventure site to actually place there.\nThe adventure sites themselves are exciting location-based scenarios that the player characters can interact with in many different ways. Each adventure site has intrigues, locations, characters, treasures and suggested events. Many of them tie in to the history of the Forbidden Lands and the main Raven's Purge campaign, but all sites can be played standalone and in any order.\nEach adventure site comes with a beautifully illustrated map overview. Below, you can see one example - the village Grindbone (map art by Niklas Brandt). Several complete adventure sites will be included in the main game.\n  If the player characters make it back from the ancient ruins alive, they will hopefully bring gold and other treasures with them. Eventually, they might feel the need to spend that treasure on something lasting - a stronghold of their own.\nHaving conquered an old castle or dungeon, the player characters can turn it into their stronghold. Using fast and effective mechanics, the players can then develop their stronghold, adding features such as a forge, mill or garden, or stronger defenses.\nThe stronghold is a place to rest between adventures and a safe haven against the beasts that haunt the land. However, the stronghold needs upkeep and it might also invite the attention of others, looking to steal the player characters' riches.\nMany classic fantasy RPGs ran into the problem of player characters becoming filthy rich after much adventuring, not having much to spend their gold on. The stronghold mechanic of Forbidden Lands solves that problem - and creates a slew of new scenario hooks to boot.\n  Dark powers are stirring in the Forbidden Lands. Zygofer's henchmen, the feared Rust Brothers, still haunt the land, but the spellbinder himself has not been seen for centuries. His enemies and his allies are setting plans in motion. The Blood Mist covering the land has lifted and the deathly calm that has reigned for so long is about to shatter.\nWhile the players are free to roam the land as they see fit, there is a larger scheme behind the scenes that they can get involved in. In the campaign called Raven's Purge the players hunt for four powerful artifacts, adorned with Elven gemstones that together have the potential to decide the future of the Forbidden Lands.\nRaven's Purge is not a linear story and it has no set goal that the players are expected to follow. Instead, it is a rich tapestry of legends, characters and plans that the players can interact with in a multitude of ways. The four artifacts can be placed in any adventure sites, thus giving the GM the means to control the length and the pacing of the campaign.\nRaven's Purge will be published as a separate book, at the same time as the publication of the core game. It is included in the pledge levels OGRE and above.\n  The lore and setting of Forbidden Lands is rich and detailed, a new take on classic fantasy that we are really excited about. However, we also realize that many players already have their favorite fantasy worlds to play in, be it from other games, books or movies or homemade creations.\nThus, we have made the Forbidden Lands rules and the open-world campaign structure very easy to port to other settings. The adventure sites can easily be placed in any other fantasy setting with minor tweaks. All you need is a hexagonal map of the world you want to play in, and you're good to go!\n  With your help, we can make Forbidden Lands even more awesome!

We're thrilled to present our new Kickstarter: Dungeon of Doom!  \nWe've finished the design and the sculpting -- nearly 150 different brand new pieces!  But to create the steel molds required for production -- and to commit to the enormous production run required to bring this remarkable dungeon to gamers -- we also need your support.\nWhat makes this dungeon different from all other dungeons?\nNote: Nearly all of the pieces in this collection will be made from original Dwarvenite, as opposed to the more rigid, somewhat lighter Dwarvenite-G. \n                Links to rotating images:\nMarble 4'' Curved Dais\nLarge Curved Wall\nForsaken 6inch Wall\nForsaken 6inch Wall (Jade)\nIdol of Sysuul\nFreestanding Temple Wall\nBurrows Tripod\nJade Forsaken Temple LED Corner \nElevation Platforms: This year we\u2019re making our largest piece ever - a 12\u201d by 12\u201d platform designed to quickly elevate levels of your dungeon. Utilizing a removable lid, it allows you to build using two different heights.  \nAnd when you\u2019re done building, the platform flips over and becomes a storage tray covered with lid.  Note: The large logo area shown in this graphic will be replaced by a usable floor (as shown just under the animation).\nPLAY\n\n    Terrain Trays: Beautifully rendered trays to ground and enliven your builds -- and they give you incredible mobility to move your setups without breaking them down.  Terrain Trays work best with optional Gaskets and Anchor Magnets as shown below.\n                                                                                                                                                           12\"x12\" Terrain Trays (Stone Side) -- Two + One Added\n    The end result -- and our goal for Dungeon of Doom: provide the most fun you've ever had at the game table!\nThis year, we have six Main Pledge Levels: Dungeon Levels I - V, and the largest pledge, Dungeon of Doom! We also have a Build Your Own Dungeon pledge.\nTo showcase our vision of what these pledges can create, Dwarven Forge Creative Director, Nate Taylor, built them into 15 connecting zones called Encounter Areas.  Dungeon Level I includes the first Encounter Area, Dungeon Level II includes Encounter Areas 1-3, and so on, to the Dungeon of Doom Level, which includes all 15.  So each successive Pledge Level transports you deeper into Doom!\nIn fact, we are even preparing a pdf module that includes an adventure for each Encounter.\n      The Encounter Areas are just a start.  While Nate\u2019s compositions are just suggestions, we think they illustrate how rich a new system this is \u2013 and how you can build an amazing setup filled with unique challenges, special surprises and a story all its own. For example, the photos below show some examples of what you can create with Dungeon Level II.  Imagine what you can build with even more. This is not your Dwarven father\u2019s dungeon!\n   Please take note as you review our sets:\n   Here is each Encounter Area in greater detail:\n                                          Optional limited edition version of Encounter #15 (same sculpts, different colors):\n    Our Main Pledge Levels are listed below from smallest to largest.  In addition to these, we have a large selection of Add-On Sets to enhance your main pledge.\nChoose whichever set(s) you want, add them up on our pledge calculator or our online spreadsheet, and that's your pledge total. (After the campaign ends, we will reconfirm all your set selections using our online pledge manager.)\nFRIEND OF THE FORGE ($1):  No product, but our sincere gratitude.  Feel free to use this pledge level as a placeholder to ensure that you receive updates.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   FREE STRETCH GOALS\nAs the funding level of this Kickstarter grows, our production run gets larger and more efficient. This enables us to add in free stretch goal pieces that \"unlock\" -- and are automatically added to your pledge -- at specified funding milestones.  These milestones are eligible to unlock until the Kickstarter ends on July 11, at 9PM US Eastern time.\nEach stretch goal fits into a specific Encounter Area (e.g. \"Lever Chamber,\" \"Gorgon Room,\" etc). If your pledge includes that Encounter Area, you receive that stretch goal when it unlocks; if your pledge does not include that room, you do not receive that stretch goal.\nNew this year: If you order individual Encounter Areas as Add-on sets (including with the Build Your Own Dungeon pledge), you do receive the unlocked stretch goals for that Encounter Area.  (Note: there are not free stretch goals for any other sets apart from Encounter Areas.)\nOur Final Stretch Goal Chart is shown below: \n          An extensive assortment of paid Add-on Sets adds variety, features and coverage to your main Dungeon of Doom pledge. New Add-on sets will be released throughout the campaign. \nClick on the category links below to see the Add-on Sets we've unlocked so far -- or click here to view them all.  \nAlso note: every individual Encounter Area (1-15) is also available as an Add-on set. \n                                             How to pledge for Add-on Sets:  It's easy. \nFirst, use our pledge calculator or our Google spreadsheet to select the main pledge and add-on set(s) you want and calculate their total cost.\nNext, remember that those two tools don't talk to Kickstarter.  So you need to confirm or change your total pledge amount on Kickstarter (to your signed in account).  (Once you do this, Kickstarter will charge you this total once the campaign closes.)  \nThen, a few weeks after the campaign closes, you will receive an invitation to our online pledge manager.  We will use that to confirm all your individual set selections and your shipping address.  You can also alter/add to your selections then. (Please note we cannot issue Kickstarter refunds in the pledge manager.)\nA few more details:\nYou can change your Add-on Set selections as often as you'd like until the end of the campaign.\nIf you want more than one base pledge, you can simply add the additional pledge the same way you include an Add-on Set. Just add the amount of the second pledge onto your overall total. There's no need to create a whole new Kickstarter pledge (all applicable Stretch Goals are still included).\nPlease note: only Backers at the Build Your Own Dungeon level and above (Level I through Dungeon of Doom!) are eligible for paid Add-On sets. \nWe offer all sets completely painted by hand. Or, if you prefer to paint yourself or want a more economical option, you can order your sets in Dungeon Gray. The difference between these choices is highlighted below.\n  We founded Dwarven Forge in 1996 to offer the world\u2019s finest -- and most useable -- handcrafted gaming terrain. Everything is modular, so you can build something different each time you play.\nFor our first 17 years, we introduced new sets as we could afford to make them. We cast everything in resin, a relatively costly material that looks good, but chips or breaks if it's not handled carefully.\nThen, in 2013, everything changed when we launched our first Kickstarter, called Game Tiles. The campaign marked the debut of Dwarvenite\u00ae, a proprietary material that looks and feels great and is nearly indestructible -- all while being more affordable to cast than resin. The challenge: making Dwarvenite requires costly steel molds and large production runs: a staggering up-front investment that wouldn't be feasible without backing from the Kickstarter community.\nThanks to incredible backer support, Game Tiles was a great success. It led to three more exciting campaigns, Caverns in 2014, City Builder in 2015 and Castle Builder in 2016. The Castle program took us the longest to produce, both we and the factory learned a tremendous amount resolving the large piece sizes and stacking towers and walls.  This year we go back underground.\nNotes:\n1) You can modify your main pledge level and your pledge total anytime until the campaign closes on July 11th.\n2) Don't worry that Kickstarter doesn't capture your Add-On Set selections. We actually do that after the campaign ends, with our online pledge manager. Kickstarter tells us how much you pledged. We then give you an online order form that shows your total paid pledge amount and your main pledge selection (e.g Dungeon Level IV). You can then fill in all your specific set choices (as well as your shipping address).\nShipping and Delivery:\nUSA: As with our previous campaigns, US ground shipping (probably ground UPS) is included.\nNon-USA: Shipping outside the US requires an additional payment per base pledge and per Add-On set. All these charges are displayed on our pledge calculator.  These charges also include import fees and duties for shipments to Canada, the EU, Australia and New Zealand -- but not for any other countries. We regret that the VAT in particular adds a lot to our EU shipping prices, but we're afraid this is unavoidable.  \nOne suggestion: we've found that a number of people use package forwarding companies based in the US to ship packages to them overseas.  We don't endorse any of them, but this might be a way for you to save on shipping.\nWe deeply appreciate the interest of backers from all over the world, and we apologize that we aren\u2019t able to make any exceptions to these extra charges.\nWe expect to ship your Kickstarter product by April, 2018. We always try to deliver worldwide at the same time, but deliveries outside North America sometimes require a little extra time.\nIf you like what you see, please spread the word, and join the conversation in the Comments section.

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have been in the terrain business for over 20 years, with a constant dedication to quality and service. \n\nShipments for our last Kickstarter campaign (Castles) are nearly complete. \nWe were late with these deliveries, primarily due to retooling needed to ensure that the walls and towers were more precise and robust. Shipments for our previous 3 Kickstarter campaigns were completed on schedule. \n\nNotably, the focus of this Kickstarter is on design, variety and features --\nand unlike the Castles, the architecture of these pieces does not require the extremely fine tolerances (e.g. the stackable tower walls) that delayed that project. In addition, for the first time, final, fully refined sculpts for nearly every single piece in this Kickstarter are already complete. \n\nWhile it's understandable to think that we would hold this new campaign until 100% of the Castles are shipped, we felt that additional delay of this Kickstarter would push the bulk of casting and tooling into the Christmas production season, a time when everything takes much longer and during which quality often takes a back seat to completing and shipping seasonal merchandise. This is the main reason we are launching now.\n\nWe are very familiar with the technologies, skills and resources required to produce and deliver the rewards promised in this Kickstarter. Several factors, however, could affect the delivery time. These include weather and labor related events that could slow down delivery, for example, a strike in the ports.\n\nWe intend as before to have all our product tested for safety and reliability. All the of products shown in the stills and video are resin prototypes. While our actual production should be even more refined, there might be some minor changes made to facilitate production.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Friend of the Forge", "descp": "Our sincere appreciation for your support.

Check out the Book of Celestial Heroes update and the Exemplar class playtest!\n All pledges of $100 or above receive a PDF and at-cost print voucher for Book of Celestial Heroes included with their rewards.\n  This is my team's fifth Kickstarter-funded campaign setting and you can check out previews for the last two here and here.\nThese are my print proofs for each previous campaign setting (the covers for 2099 Wasteland and Mists of Akuma wrap entirely around and only look like this in the two books you see here).\nWhen we finished the 2099 Wasteland Kickstarter (ahead of schedule and bigger than expected! :D) I said to myself, \"that's enough Mike, stay focused,\" and began to layout a Shadow of the Demon Lord conversion for Mists of Akuma.\nBut something in the back of my head wouldn't stop whispering and there was no escaping the evil, forbidden voice. It followed me day and night, hounding at me, nipping at the heels of my mind.\nI did my best to ignore it until it utterly refused to accept that conclusion.\nBut Miiike. Inaequa is the answer, Mike. Inaequa.\nInaequa is what really makes the Book of Exalted Darkness work. When we initially started this project (over a year ago) the idea was a standard medieval world. Middle-Earth where the angels have won!\nBut what's the real appeal of that? Where's the real bite, the hook?\nThen came the idea to make the world decopunk. Nothing pairs better with angelic and celestial aesthetic than The Rocketeer and Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, and it brought a little bit of really appealing pulpy feel. A wonderful combination! But still something was missing\u2014a linchpin that really makes all these concepts fit together. That's inaequa.\nDon't get me wrong\u2014playing an evil PC can be entertaining and rewarding in itself\u2014but for a whole campaign? For an entire group to play despicable characters weeks on end? That's not always easy for everyone to be intrigued by and can prove difficult to keep banded together. But what if there was something fundamentally wrong with the supreme goodness that has blessed the world? That's where inaequa comes in.\nInaequa powers the marvels and wonders of technology in the decopunk world of Askis, but it also gives off radiation that lengthens the lifespan of good creatures.\nWhat a quandary!\nInherently inaequa is not evil, nor are its effects\u2014it favors one morality over another but even so there's nothing fundamentally wrong with it and YET, and YET! That's a complex package worth unfolding!\nLike my other campaign settings there are new thematic attributes that play very heavily into the central element of inaequa that allow PCs to trick devices powered by the resource or otherwise manipulate them, overcharging an inaequa jetpack for a brief burst of speed before burning out or setting off an inaequa gun to explode like a grenade. \nWith this final major reagent in the maddened minds of the design team, the utopian world and the paths evil adventurers will pursue to bring balance back to Askis (or an evil imbalance!) poured out in a frenzied torrent of truly wicked game design.\nBut what exactly is in this 180 page full color hardcover book?\nTHE HOLY DECOPUNK UTOPIA OF ASKIS and its three continents: contiguous Ouranios, Samovi, and Zakuthombo. \nTHE 9 SPHERES OF ASKIS, great workings of the Celestial Heroes that rule over the world. By subverting or upending these essential pillars of civilization the PCs will either bring society down around them or rise to rule over the world!\nDOZENS OF NPCs throughout the establishment of Askis' government as well as the 20th level Celestial Heroes themselves (a tiefling sorcerer, dwarven cleric, half-orc fighter, aasimar paladin, half-elf bard, elven wizard, gnome ranger, halfling rogue, and human monk). As the evil adventurers go about destroying or mastering the 9 spheres of the world, these legends will be their staunchest opposition and most difficult assassination targets!\nTWO NEW ABILITY SCORES (Sanctity and Sin) AND SIN POINTS to give evil adventurers an edge!\nINHERENT HERESIES that all despicable PCs in Askis gain at character creation: anger, envy, gluttony, greed, lust, pride, or sloth (and whatever other vile ideas playtesters offer up, like mendacity).\nEVIL CHARACTER BACKGROUNDS to play a \"reformed\" murderer, disloyal traitor, unholy witness, and more!\nTHREE CLASSES: the demon or devil summoning Diabolist, lunatics that transform themselves into monsters via the paths of the Occultist, and of course Mad Scientists!\nNEW CLASS ARCHETYPES FOR EVERY CLASS! Fearmonger sorcerers, abyssal and infernal clerics, feral barbarians, dark chi monks, and many more!\nFEATS, FEATS, AND MORE FEATS! Gain a deformity like Corpulence or a Malformed Basal Ganglia then graft on the horn of a unicorn, wings of an angel, or skin of a devil! Maybe formalized magic is more your thing and you'd like some Voodoo or to master Ritualistic Slaughter? If not you can always just snag some Sinful feats to get down with being bad. ;)\nDARK TRANSFORMATION PRESTIGE CLASSES! D&D 5E hasn't offered any of these yet and we're very excited to see how they work in a larger playtest so that we can craft solid rules for becoming a dark one, fiend, kyton, ooze, rakshasa, protolich, or even one of the nearly extinct chromatic dragons! \nTHE EVIL MAGIC TRADITION, an entire school of magic dedicated to being vile with more than two dozen spells including blood spear, bone spurs, cerebral hemorrhage, flay skin, sanguine razorstorm, and whatever else playtesters feel the book needs!\nVILE AFFLICTIONS because what's a book about evil without some new diseases and poisons?!\nEXPANDED FEAR RULES for GMs that want to include more terror in their games!\nFORBIDDEN MAGIC ITEMS by JAMES INTROCASO, VILE AFFLICTIONS, EXPANDED FEAR RULES, NEW MONSTERS BOTH GOOD AND EVIL, GAMEMASTERING TIPS FOR EVIL GAMES and MUCH MORE!\nMany pledge levels include at-cost print vouchers: your Kickstarter pledge pays for the PDF and when the book is done, you can get a physical copy for the cost of the ink, paper, glue, and shipping (estimated cost for 180 page hardcover prints: $13.29 or \u00a39.50; shipping varies by location).\nI have done Kickstarters with direct print rewards but my experience has been that a far better, bigger book can be produced with the flexibility offered by print vouchers (Hypercorps 2099 was not done by voucher and only 20% larger than promised whereas Veranthea Codex doubled in size and both Mists of Akuma and 2099 Wasteland delivered at 50% larger than anticipated). \nThe final cover artwork for this book will be done by Indi Martin (who did the fantastic covers for the Evil Primer and Killing the Golden Twins) when we know the project is going to fund. :D\n  BACKER GOAL #1 - 120 PLEDGES:\nBook of Celestial Heroes UNLOCKED!\nFor every bit iniquitous, nefarious, and wicked the Book of Exalted Darkness is, the Book of Celestial Heroes is just as illuminating, redeeming, and uplifting. Etch out your heroes\u2019 place in history by protecting the divine gifts blessing the world, achieving a true utopia for the rest of time! More information about this UNLOCKED add-on and new pledge reward can be found here.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nSTRETCH GOAL #1 - UNLOCKED: Mists of Akuma is my first conversion to the Shadow of the Demon Lord RPG but I want to take the Book of Exalted Darkness to it as well! When we reach 150 backers or $5,500 (whichever happens first!) this will be available as an add-on for either a PDF, a print voucher, or both!\nSTRETCH GOAL #2 - FIENDISH LORDS: When we reach $6,000 or 165 backers, a new section will be added to both the Book of Exalted Darkness and the Book of Celestial Heroes--demon lords from the Abyss and the devils of Hell! As villains you might ally yourself with or gain boons from these despicable fiends, and as a holy hero you'll be able to take the fight to them!\nADD-ONS\n$5 - VTT Map Pack: High-resolution digital maps for every map that appears in The Book of Exalted Darkness.\n$15 - Book of Celestial Heroes PDF for do-gooders in Askis!\n$20 - Book of Celestial Heroes Print Voucher for exemplary adventurers that want a tome in their hands!\n$20 - Extra Print Vouchers (6): Are you the owner of a Friendly Local Game Store? We want to support you! For every extra $20 you pledge you'll receive six (6) more print vouchers that should allow you to maintain a reasonable mark-up for selling the Book of Exalted Darkness in your store. Make sure to let your FLGS know about this add-on!\n$30* - Book of Exalted Darkness Art Prints: Do you love Indi's artwork as much as we do?

(10 pt) stock prints to keep the balance of evil and good in your home or office! (*International backers that want this add-on should include an additional $15 in shipping costs.)\n$30 - Book of Celestial Heroes PDF and Print Voucher for the truly devout do-gooder that wants something digital and in their gaming bag!\n$100 - Online Mini-Campaign: Mike Myler will design and run a small campaign using the Book of Exalted Darkness and Roll20.net for you and up to five friends! This will be a minimum of 5 sessions played at the discretion of Mike Myler's existing schedule for Kickstarter games (Sundays are booked through late summer 2017 with Mists of Akuma and 2099 Wasteland sessions). \nPLAYTEST\nAll backers that have pledged for a PDF or print voucher of Book of Exalted Darkness gain access to the playtest google document as soon as the project's funding period ends or when we reach $10,000 of pledges (whichever comes first).\nPROJECT TEAM\nBook of Exalted Darkness is the work of the same design team behind Hypercorps 2099 and Mists of Akuma\u2014myself (Mike Myler), Michael McCarthy, Luis Loza, and Savannah Broadway\u2014with one exception: James Introcaso is on board for magic items. For illustrations however we are devoting all of our art budget (about half of the funding goal) to giving one person (the ridiculously talented Indi Martin) money to conjure more pieces like the covers of the free PDFs above. Other than that (barring potential new designers and artists from stretch goals) that's it because I do my own cartography, graphics, and layout.\nWhile there's undeniable value from the input and perspective a larger team brings to a book, the more hands that are in the pot the longer it takes to get material finished\u2014often not even due to negligence but a statistical increase to the chances of people suffering emergencies (not to mention more time spent communicating instead of just getting the work done!) and the more difficult it can become to keep a strong vision of the project in place. \nThese are my A-Team and this is our next mission: we know one another well, work together seamlessly, and are tried and proven to produce amazing things! \nPlease consider backing this project! Thanks!\n PS: If you get the name, you should definitely pledge. ;)\nMore on the World of Askis\nFolks on the internet have asked for more information about the campaign setting itself and I don't want to leave anyone disappointed (see Risks and Challenges below) so I'm compiling the juiciest reveals from project updates here.\nBut first let's dig into the big overlaying structure behind the world: the 9 Spheres of Askis.\nLong ago the world's \"heroes\"--three adventuring parties known as Tucker the Great & Co., The Order of the Shining Stone, and The Golden Redeemers--smote all of Askis' evils, beating back corruption and nearly purging it from the planet. Each of the nine Celestial Heroes is responsible for maintaining a ward against malevolence, keeping it at bay through a variety of both mundane and magical means. \nThe Order of the Shining Stone: Gimli Stoneflask - NG Dwarf Cleric (The Towers of Light), Varrus Goodwin - LG Human Monk (Monastic Order of Law), and Rankir Tarryndorn - CG Elven Wizard (Bands of Kyttarmoak) \nThe Golden Redeemers: Tapper Underknoll - NG Gnome Ranger (Samovi Evil Preserve), Damien Ventrelli - CG Tiefling Sorcerer (Holy Virulence), and Lellwyn Fethyrwal - LG Aasimar Paladin (Shadows of Vanity)\nTucker the Great and Co.: Mystral Farsong - CG Half-Elf Bard (Bloodsong Storms), Grukk the Axe - LG Half-Orc Fighter (Chime of Contests), and (of course) Tucker Quickfoot - NG Halfling Rogue (Inaequa)\nObviously the Book of Exalted Darkness has a ton of awesome evil player options (see the bullet list above!) inside of it, but these classically typed NPCs are at the apex of what the PCs must accomplish in order to bring balance back to the unjust world--starting with the spheres. \nEach update (after the first, anyway, but that's alright because Inaequa gets a lot of love up there) will include information about one of these key features of Askis so stay tuned and keep an eye on the update tab!\nSphere of Askis - Bloodsong Storms: The half-elf bard Mystral Farsong is responsible for a powerful and encompassing ballad that floats quietly just above the waters of Askis' oceans and seas, a sub rosa melody that reverberates along the waves of the world in search of only one thing: the freshly-spilled blood of humanoids.\nWhile this is a powerful enchantment and not to be underestimated, the vast distance it must cover makes this great celestial work a tertiary sphere--PCs might be able to undo it by 12th level or if they are particularly clever, maybe as low as 10th.\nEvil hearts that persist in the utopia of Askis do so either underground, with the aid of technology or magic to hide their wickedness, inside reform institutions (undergoing brainwashing to become good), or on the high seas living a life of piracy! The Bloodsong Storms detects when a nefarious seafarer is nearby (sensing an aura of evil) and blood spills onto the water, causing the global enchantment to begin conjuring a small storm in the nearby area. The more flowing crimson and malevolence there is, the worse the storm gets until reaching a true tempest--the sort of thing any naval ship is likely to see, report, and respond to!\nLike all of the Celestial Heroes' great works the powerful melody requires attention and care to be maintained. Mystral is the only person on the planet able to perform the daily tasks that keep the Bloodsong Storm strong, though the details of her rites and what the PCs need to do to destroy her creation will appear in the Book of Exalted Darkness.\nSphere of Askis - Chime of Contests: All of the Celestial Heroes are capable of incredible feats and possess great prowess, but that does not mean they are all geniuses. Grukk the Axe is, as his name would suggest, not terribly sophisticated or nuanced. As his companions went about constructing their great works--Tucker negotiating with the powers of heaven itself for access to inaequa, Mystral composing her elegant Bloodsong Storms--the half-orc searched through Trucker the Great and Co.\u2019s treasure hoard, seeking out the most valuable metals and gems he could find. The fighter took them into the rim of the Herculane Volcano, forging a huge cymbal made from adamantine, mithral, and jewels fused together by the heat of the planet and the strength of Grukk\u2019s soul: the Chime of Contests.\nSince then his fellow Celestial Heroes (the dwarven cleric Gimli Stoneflask, the tiefling sorcerer Damien Ventrelli, and the elven wizard Rankir Tarryndorn) have used their magics to enchant Grukk\u2019s creation, turning it into a proper artifact capable of sensing the entirety of the world and connecting the souls of those who have pledged themselves to the half-orc\u2019s crusade for honor. To become a part of this revered order is the lifelong ambition of many a young warrior though few prove able, falling in the final test for admission--holding their own in battle with Grukk for a full minute. Any that succeed (whether by guile or prowess) are brought into the fold, attuning themselves to the Chime of Contests and roaming the lands of Askis in search of its telltale ringing.  \nWhen a sentient (Intelligence of 3 or higher) creature fights dishonorably (by ambushing a target without challenging them first, using dirty tactics, striking a helpless opponent, or utilizes other dastardly tactics at the discretion of the GM) any Knife of the Chime within a certain range hears a telltale ringing from that general direction. These warriors are honor-bound to investigate any instances they are able to and this inevitably draws attention to evil afoot in Askis, whether they are able to stop it immediately or are left to deduce what has happened from whatever remains from a despicable combat.\nNot Entirely Alone\nWhile evil isn't at all common on Askis, it is a little easier to find under Askis. Mad scientists are the only lot of iniquity that have managed to collectively elude and resist the Celestial Heroes' purges, staying one step ahead of their oppressors at every turn. It is through these insane geniuses (which is one of the 3 classes in the book!) that parties of evil adventurers are gathered together and directed, used as pawns in long and elaborate plans--until the players turn the tables when the opportunity presents itself, of course, as any nefarious-minded group of wicked villains will eventually do at one time or another. The first of these deranged inventors, Gespadrieux (pictured above) appears in the Killing the Golden Twins adventure module but more will be included throughout the Book of Exalted Darkness.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my 6th Kickstarter project and we completed the last one (2099 Wasteland) not only ahead of schedule but also at 50% larger than the anticipated page count.

Much like a model kit, some assembly is required. We provide the pieces \u2013 all you need is some paint, a little glue, and a steady hand.\nPrep-light, improv-heavy GMs will enjoy the versatility and flexibility that Adventure Kits provide, while GMs who prefer going into games with a lot of prepared material will appreciate utilizing the toolkit to create a fully fleshed out adventure quickly and easily.   \n      Within, you\u2019ll find inspiration, mechanics, and ready-made, modular add-ons for each adventure. Use as little or as much as you need to create your unique adventure.\nAdventure Setting: A brief description of the world, realm, and region that the adventure is set in, including a quick note on how to run it in your own campaign world.  \nWorld Primer: The most important tenets of the world that the adventure is set in. These are the details that give the world its tone and feel.\nAdventure Overview: This top-down view includes high concept details of the lore, tone, and possible conflicts.  \nMap: Each Adventure Kit includes a modular map of the adventuring location for easy reference. You can find full-size maps for use with miniatures available for purchase at www.HeroicMaps.com.\nLocations: Each area of the adventure includes a flavorful description and applicable mechanics, as well as sights, sounds, and sensations.\nEncounters: This list of encounters includes at least one of each of the following: a roleplay encounter, a combat, a skill challenge, a puzzle or trap, and a climactic encounter.  \nNPCs: Each Adventure Kit comes packed with a handful of unique and thematic non-player characters, complete with basic stats, personality traits, and even secrets for use in roleplay encounters.  \nResolution and Rewards: This section offers some suggested adventure resolutions and ideas for rewards and loot for the adventurers. \nToolbox: Modular add-ons and adventure enhancements like mechanics, thematic phrases, set dressing, trinkets and loot, and simple generators for monsters, skill challenges, and traps.\n                                                             ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nQ: Can Absolute Tabletop handle this project? \nA: Although this will be Absolute Tabletop\u2019s first Kickstarter, it will be our eighteenth published RPG book, all of which we\u2019ve written, produced, funded, managed, and delivered to customers on our own. We know our way around a production schedule, and are adept at managing projects and meeting deadlines. For us, Kickstarter is a way to reach a wider audience, and fund a larger amount of art. For our first Kickstarter, we\u2019re keeping things simple and focused to ensure that we can deliver a quality product that is on time or early. Our track record with our customers is one of communication and over-delivering, and we plan to keep that intact here on Kickstarter.\n\nQ: Is this book written? \nA: The fully-working playtest version of the product is 100-percent written and will be made available for backers after the Kickstarter funds and closes. We have a tried-and-true writing and editing process that we know works, and have no concerns about delays.\n\nQ: What if the complexity of executing a first Kickstarter overwhelms Absolute Tabletop? \nA: We have simple, straight-forward pledge levels to make it easy for us to manage. Also note that there are no additional add-ons to this project. We\u2019ve done that deliberately in order to keep the project manageable for our small but dedicated team.\n\nQ: What about delays in art? \nA: We'll be using artists that we\u2019ve worked with for more than two years, who have always delivered high-quality art on or before deadline. We\u2019ve already begun sourcing the art, working with the artists and preparing for any level of success with sketches and thumbnails so that the wheels are in motion. This makes it a simple matter of the artist finishing a piece we\u2019ve already decided the look and feel of via thumbnail.\n\nQ: What about increases in shipping costs? \nA: We\u2019ve done an exorbitant amount of research on this, as it\u2019s something that can easily burn first time Kickstarters. Shipping costs constantly rise, and while we've projected them to the best of our abilities, there's not a lot we can do if they change. However, due to the limitations on the size of our product, we're confident this won't be an issue, and we have contingencies in place. In addition, we\u2019re fair, honest people, and will be hyper communicative of any potential changes as soon as they\u2019re a possibility. We are offering FREE shipping to all of our U.S. backers.\n\nQ: Why is your goal so low?\nA: Being our first Kickstarter, we\u2019re trying to be shrewd, and pace ourselves. We\u2019ve made the goal for the project as tight as possible while still being able to deliver a gorgeous, high-quality project. We\u2019re starting small because we care about quality, and our reputation, and are taking our first Kicktarter one step at a time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Trapped Under Ice", "descp": "You have our undying thanks.

With expertise in multi-touch displays; mixed, augmented and virtual reality solutions; as well as interactive holography \u2013 the teams at Mesa Mundi can pull from a vast well-spring of design and technical knowledge.\nWorld Engine was originally conceived as a proof-of-concept, online tile mapping tool back in 2014. The technology was not at a level where this type of tool was practical and, as a result, World Engine sat in an \"internal use-only\" bin where it had the joyous job of creating GenCon Crawl event maps! \nAs HTML5 technology grew in speed and performance, World Engine grew too. In the summer of 2016, prior to GenCon, World Engine received a minor face lift to leverage updated libraries and tool sets. The result was the core of what is currently available for preview (link above) \u2013 a fast, versatile and robust mapping solution with a great deal of promise.\nThis project is founded on the strong base of the original World Engine and shaped by our team's experience over the last three years, leading to the re-imagining of World Engine as the definitive online map making solution.\nAlthough many key components of World Engine are well underway, funding this Kickstarter will help us complete important aspects and add many advanced features.\nWorld Engine will be available as an alpha and beta, so Kickstarter Backers can try it right away and provide feedback to help us create the best map-making tool on the market.\n  Social Media Share Buttons\nHelp spread the word!

In the end, we decided that if we were going to have to make such wide, sweeping, changes we may as well create the project in a system that gave us more flexibility."}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 220, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/magehand/world-engine-an-online-map-making-tool-for-tableto", "project_name": "World Engine: An Online Map-Making Tool for Tabletop RPGs"}}, {"backer": "Jaye Sonia", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "  Have you ever struggled with Productivity, Discipline & FOCUS? \nYou're not alone.\nAre you busy all day long but have little to show for it?\nI have a little secret for you...\nWe ALL struggle with productivity, discipline and focus. \nThe problem is, these skills are CRITICAL to success in both business and life.\nAllow me to introduce the solution:\nThe Mastery Journal\nYour step-by-step guide to mastering productivity, discipline & focus in 100 days.\n   \nMy business (EOFire) has evolved into a multi-million dollar a year business, but I struggled for YEARS.\nMy days often looked like this:\nAH-HA moments struck like lightning bolts! \nI\u2019d imagine my future success and the impact it would have on my life. \nI'd bask in the glow of this 'future' success. \nI\u2019d sit on the idea for a couple days, and then life would take over. \nSlowly but surely I'd lose momentum and the idea would wither and die.\nNothing would happen, and my life would go on as before.\nAfter experiencing this circle of failure for years, I learned how to master productivity, discipline and focus.\nNow, AH-HA moments withering on the vine is a thing of the past.\nMy most recent AH-HA moment was to create a guide to help others master productivity, discipline and focus.\nThe Mastery Journal was born, and I'm FIRED UP to be sharing it with you today! \nIn the video below, JLD will walk you through the contents of The Mastery Journal!\n  PLAY\n\n \nThe #1 Frustration for Entrepreneurs?\nMaintaining the discipline and focus required to be productive. \nBad ideas are not the reason Entrepreneurs fail.\nEntrepreneurs fail because of a lack of execution.\nThe Mastery Journal will guide you step-by-step in EXECUTING your plan of action.\nSimply put, The Mastery Journal is an accountability partner that won\u2019t let you fail! \n   \nI\u2019ve interviewed 1500+ successful and inspiring Entrepreneurs.\nAll 1500, myself included, struggle to maintain discipline and focus throughout the day.\nWe\u2019re only human after all!\nThe Mastery Journal is your key to overcoming that struggle & beginning your journey to success!  \n        Morning routine: The Mastery Journal will get your day off to the right start.\nFour daily sessions: Timed sessions where you have ONE focus.\nDaily self-evaluation: Evaluating your strengths & weaknesses is critical to your success. \n10-day recaps: Amplify what\u2019s working, adjust what\u2019s not, and establish your 10 day productivity and discipline scores. \nWin tomorrow today: End each day knowing how you are going to WIN tomorrow. \nDaily affirmations: Positive mindset is KEY.\nInspiring Quotes: Hand-picked quotes from JLD to inspire you daily. \nand SO much more... \n   \nHere\u2019s your opportunity to follow a proven plan to IGNITE your day & INSPIRE your life\nMomentum is hard to attain.\nThe good news?\nOnce you\u2019ve attained a little momentum, achieving success becomes easier.\nThe Mastery Journal will IGNITE your momentum, and the sky's the limit!\n   \nIt\u2019s time to:\nInvest in yourself\u2026\nInvest in your future...\nInvest in The Mastery Journal!\n   \nSelf-Evaluation\nTracking your productivity can be tedious and repetitive, which is why we've included self-evaluation sections designed to keep you motivated and engaged.\nWith four focused daily sessions, nightly preparation and 10-day recaps, a dramatic boost in your productivity, discipline and focus is a mere 100 days away!\n   \n The Success Pack!\n   \nThe Mastery Journal + The Freedom Journal\nIn 2016, we launched The Freedom Journal, a step-by-step guide to accomplishing your #1 goal in 100 days.\nIn preparing to launch The Mastery Journal we received many versions of the question:\nHow do The Mastery Journal and The Freedom Journal work together?\nSo glad you asked! \nThe Freedom Journal will guide you in accomplishing your #1 goal in 100 days.

The way is winding and dangerous, but the rewards are great for the adventuresome and bold.\nThe rewards for the Midgard Kickstarter include 3 primary books, plus a slew of thrilling adventures and crunchy expansions! The core rewards include these volumes:\nMidgard Campaign Setting for 5th Edition and Pathfinder RPG: A 300+ page volume describing the Midgard regions, from the Northlands to the Western Wastes, and from the Southlands to the Crossroads. With detailed locations, cities, rulers, heraldry, plots, and adventure hooks galore, plus full details of the various pantheons, masked gods, and dark gods, there\u2019s enough here to fuel years of adventuring!\nIn this updated edition, you\u2019ll get the expanded Blood Kingdom of Morgau and updates to Zobeck, the Cantons, the Western Wastes, and other regions, plus all-new chapters on the Shadow Realm and Blood Kingdom as standalone chapters. It's a rich and standalone edition of the setting.\nThis book is available in both a regular cover and in a special limited edition with leatherette cover, bookmark, and stamped gold foil, plus a handbound leather edition.\nMidgard Heroes Handbook for 5th Edition: Full details for Midgard races, variants, archetypes, and backgrounds\u2014everything you need to play trollkin, ravenfolk, kobolds, and others! You\u2019ll also get more than a dozen new cleric domains, new weapons and equipment, and Deep Magic spells and traditions such as Clockwork Magic and Ley Line Magic, plus new options for every class in the PHB. Stretch goals will add even more Deep Magic to the book. A complete 5th Edition Midgard handbook! \nMidgard Player\u2019s Guide for Pathfinder RPG: Collects all of Midgard\u2019s racial lore, class options, feats, and equipment under one set of covers\u2014plus new material for ley line magic, and more. We hope to expand it with shadow magic and other stretch goals. Developed by Paizo staff developer Amanda Hamon Kunz.\nEldritch Lairs for 5th Edition and Pathfinder RPG: A series of one-shot adventures written by James Haeck, Mike Shea, and other designers, like the Prepared! collection of one-shots. A print volume is included with the premium tiers (and available  as an add-on for Basic pledge tiers).\n For those who want the best level of detail, here are the pledge tiers in detail, showing what's what!\n  The Midgard Campaign Setting is a world of dark roads and deep magic, firmly rooted in European myths and legends. While some regions of Midgard have been played since the 80s, Zobeck and the Crossroads were first published in 2006, and the world was originally published in 2012.\nMidgard supports the 5th Edition of the world\u2019s first RPG, as well as the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and others. Its players enjoy both wide-ranging rules support and a rich variety of adventures. Now we\u2019re ready to update the setting by a decade, and to reveal a few of the secrets hinted at in the first edition of Midgard\u2014while introducing new secrets and mysteries, of course! Baba Yaga knows much, and shares enough lore and schemes to fuel the next 5 years of campaigning.\nFor more specifics, check out the detailed Midgard overview on the Kobold Press site!\nAs always, we hope to raise more than the core funding goal to allow the development and publication of larger books with additional chapters, both for DMs and for players. Here are all our funded goals for expanded rewards.\n                 Backer goals depend on the number of people pledging to the project, rather than the number of dollars. They reflect the strength of interest in the setting.\nWe hope to fund an ongoing set of releases for the Midgard Campaign Setting, and possibly open the setting to publication by others in an Open World model. Any supporter who pledges even $1 to the project counts toward reaching the backer goals. \n      Questions?

While this form of playtest and collaboration is welcome and traditional for Kobold Press (meaning, we've done it often and know how long it takes!), it does mean that pledges for the core book may be delayed if cartography, feedback, or layout for the central pillar of the project are delayed.\n\nIn addition, we are always at the mercy of printers, shipping companies, customs, the US Post Office, and other partners for fulfilling pledges. Fortunately, this is our 10th Kickstarter and close to our 30th crowd-funded project, so we have a good handle on what's possible, and what sort of time to allow for normal setbacks and the friction of producing creative work.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 19 or more", "title": "Midgard 5E Heroes Handbook PDF", "descp": "All the Midgard races, backgrounds, more than a dozen new divine domains, masses of new spells, equipment and more.\nINCLUDES:\nMidgard 5E Heroes Handbook PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2017"}], "stat": ["40 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 19 or more", "title": "Midgard PFRPG Player's Guide PDF", "descp": "All the Midgard races, archetypes, racial variants, divine domains, spells, equipment and more.\nINCLUDES:\nMidgard PFRPG Player's Guide PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2017"}], "stat": ["15 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Midgard Campaign PDF", "descp": "A vastly expanded and updated campaign setting, moving the timeline forward 10 years and adding new regions to the setting, plus new maps, hooks, and characters.\nINCLUDES:\nMidgard Campaign Setting Revised PDF\nMidgard Digital Map", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2017"}], "stat": ["41 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "Midgard 5E Heroes Handbook Print & PDF", "descp": "All the Midgard races, backgrounds, divine domains, spells, equipment and more in print and in PDF.\nINCLUDES:\nMidgard 5E Heroes Handbook PDF\nMidgard 5E Heroes Handbook Hardcover", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["41 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "Midgard PFRPG Player's Guide Print & PDF", "descp": "All the Midgard races, backgrounds, clerical domains, spells, equipment and more.\nINCLUDES:\nMidgard PFRPG Player's Guide Hardcover\nMidgard PFRPG Player's Guide PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["7 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "Basic 5E Setting & Heroes Handbook PDF", "descp": "The campaign PDF plus the Heroes Handbook PDF with the Midgard races, backgrounds, divine domains, spells, equipment and more.

The best part: we delivered Vufine to our 1400 backers. We believe in making our technology as simple as possible to help users take advantage of their favorite devices hands-free and at an affordable price.\n      Introducing Vufine+\nBuilt upon the invaluable feedback from our backers, we\u2019re back with Vufine+: the next evolution in wearable displays. Vufine+ has a larger, more versatile display and a totally redefined docking station. Like our first unit, Vufine+ is able to connect to most major smartphones, laptops, tablets, drones and cameras to provide a second monitor or mirrored display for the user. This connection is achieved through the included micro-to-full HDMI cable and, depending on the device, appropriate HDMI adaptor.\n                       The Screen:\nWith Vufine+ we wanted to make the screen larger and more versatile. Our first campaign taught us just how many users were connecting Vufine with tablets or with smartphones displaying in portrait. With Vufine+ we made sure that no matter what device you\u2019ve connected you are getting the largest display possible.\n      Display Modes:\nVufine+ offers 3 different display modes to allow users to optimize the display no matter what device they are using. The new Zoom Mode has increased the size of portrait displays and 4:3 landscape displays by 77% and the new Fit Mode expands 16:9 landscape by 33% with the Standard Mode designed specifically for unaltered 16:9 viewing.\nFit: The new Fit Mode has increased landscape by 33%\nZoom: The new Zoom Mode has increased the size of portrait displays by 77%\nStandard: Designed specifically for unaltered 16:9 viewing. \n   The Docking Station: \nLastly, we completely redesigned the docking station. We know a new, larger display is only as good as the ability to position it to comfort. The new docking station utilizes a ball joint and pivoting arm to allow users a whole new way to adjust Vufine+ to ensure the best, most comfortable viewing angle.\nAccessories:\nBy retaining the shape of Vufine, we were able to make Vufine+ compatible with all of the current Vufine accessories so users are able to further personalize their viewing experience. The Vufine+ package includes both the new and traditional magnetic docking stations with additional accessories available to purchase when we collect backer survey information through Backer Kit after the campaign ends.\n Colors:\nVufine+ is available in four limited edition colors through Kickstarter. So, whether it\u2019s simply a favorite color or a diehard team allegiance, Vufine+ is all about you.\n  About Us:\nVufine, Inc. was founded in February 2015 by Goro Kosaka to create a simple, wearable display that utilized the functionality of current technology. Run by a small, talented group of likeminded individuals, the Vufine team is well versed in both the wearable market and myriad challenges facing a Silicon Valley hardware start-up. Since their first Kickstarter campaign the team has been hard at work improving the Vufine wearable display and are proud to come back to the community that made it all possible with Vufine+.\n     ", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Thank You!", "descp": "Every dollar counts!

Here we are! \nA few words on what you get with this project, and why we've developed these various blasphemous, villainous, and need-to-be-stopped cults and societies.\nThe Pathfinder Roleplaying Game compatible version of this book is essentially complete in PDF, but publishing a print edition is always a gamble. We have expanded the text of the PDF series to about three times the original length, and made it a lot richer, tighter, and more evocative in its evil details. Each of these cults could be the villain in a single extremely memorable adventure--or the hidden power behind a whole campaign--or a side trek to work with your Horror Adventures hardcover.\nKobold Press regular Jeff Lee provided the new design and expanded his original text, while Paizo freelancer Jim Groves developed the manuscript. Paizo staffer Jason Keeley edited it. Kobold art director Marc Radle is completing layout now, and it could be on press as soon as Thanksgiving, and in your hands in the New Year. \nYes, we could send it out as a PDF or a print-on-demand book; but we'd really like to have it professionally printed and bound. Kickstarter makes that possible, and it offers the possibility of some cool stretch goals to expand what you get.\n5th Edition: The 5th Edition work on this book is not as far along, which is why the delivery dates are later. However, we have a separate and highly 5E-centric team working on that version: it's not the same people as the Pathfinder design and edit team.\nThe first five parts of the Demon Cults series were commissioned to support the Southlands Kickstarter, and they are quite amazing. \nHowever, people asked if we could expand them, to provide more sample cultists at various CRs, plus more new monsters and special cult-specific magic to give each cult or secret society unique tools that PCs have never seen before. Those expansions make an already playable set of villains into something even richer and more exciting.\nMaster of the Burning Rune\n  Several of the original cults were specifically created for the Southlands and work best within tropical or subtropical cultures. We wanted to keep those in this volume. (Some of them, like the pseudo-Egyptian Emerald Order of Thoth-Hermes, work pretty much in any European context as well, if you know your History of Magick.)\nHowever, we also wanted to add all-new cults based on Nordic themes and on a debauched underworld, and other wellsprings of vileness. This book will include runic cults, new demons, and various ways to sow bloody ruin in a traditional fantasy campaign well beyond the Southlands: in colder climates, rat-infested cities, and other locales.\nThis book is over 120 pages, roughly 12 pages per cult, and in full color. The cults hail from both the North and South, and they are designed to fit easily into most fantasy settings without rework (though a few are more Midgardian than others). \nIf the project is well-funded, we hope to offer you even more art and additional cults, created a rich cornucopia of malevolent mayhem!\nHere's some sample pages from the layout to date.\n    Unlike some of our prior Kickstarters, we're laying out our plan from the start. With enough backing, we'll unlock a Hero Lab add-on, a poster, and even add some expanded anti-paladins and a few additional cults to the roster. \nIf it goes REALLY well, DC&SS turns from a rich softcover into a full-bore hardcover. That's dreaming big, but then, villains always DO have world-conquering ambitions!\n                          ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis project is the most far along we've ever been with a book at the time of Kickstarting: the Pathfinder edition is in final layout, and largely ready for press. The primary risks are that we won't get timely publication due to proofing errors, print quality issues, or shipping issues of one kind or another (customs issues, primarily). \n\nThere's also the possibility that the additional material from stretch goals will push out the schedule, or that one of our primary contributors suffers health or personal troubles of one kind or another. We're a small team, and such an event could delay (but not prevent) publication.\n\nThe secondary risk is that the publisher or art director suffers an accident or personal health problem. Both are in good health, but if that were to happen it would delay publication.\n\nKobold Press has no other Kickstarter projects outstanding. They've all shipped months ago, most recently in August.\n\nWe have shipped more than 20 crowdfunded game books to date, eight of them with Kickstarter. We are confident that this one will ship as well.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 17 or more", "title": "DEMON CULTS PDF for Pathfinder RPG", "descp": "PDF of the final book plus expansion from stretch goals.\nINCLUDES:\nDemon Cults PDF for PFRPG", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2017"}], "stat": ["118 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 17 or more", "title": "DEMON CULTS PDF for 5th Edition", "descp": "PDF of the final book plus expansion from stretch goals.\nINCLUDES:\nDemon Cults PDF for 5th Edition", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2017"}], "stat": ["226 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 29 or more", "title": "PRINT & PDF for 5th Edition", "descp": "Print copy of the book for 5th Edition, plus the PDF, plus any PDF or print extras from stretch goals.\nINCLUDES:\nDemon Cults Printed Book for 5th Edition\nDemon Cults PDF for 5th Edition", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["332 backers", "Limited (1 left of 333)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 29 or more", "title": "Print & PDF for Pathfinder RPG", "descp": "Print copy of the book for Pathfinder RPG, plus the PDF, plus any PDF or print extras from stretch goals.\nINCLUDES:\nDemon Cults PDF for PFRPG\nDemon Cults Printed Book for Pathfinder RPG", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["221 backers", "Limited (112 left of 333)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 33 or more", "title": "DEMON CULTS PDF for BOTH", "descp": "PDF of the final books for both 5th Edition and Pathfinder, plus expansion from stretch goals.\nINCLUDES:\nDemon Cults PDF for 5th Edition\nDemon Cults PDF for PFRPG", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2017"}], "stat": ["24 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 34 or more", "title": "HARDCOVER and PDF for 5th Edition", "descp": "Print hardcover of the book for 5th Edition, plus the PDF, plus the PDF or print extras from stretch goals.\nINCLUDES:\nDemon Cults PDF for 5th Edition\nDemon Cults Printed Book for 5th Edition", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["257 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 63 or more", "title": "Print & PDF for BOTH SYSTEMS", "descp": "Print copy of the book for Pathfinder RPG and hardcover for 5th Edtion, plus the PDFs, plus any PDF or print extras from stretch goals.

We\u2019re running this campaign to fund the final development of the book, and we need your help raising 10,000 dollars, which will cover the final development costs for the book.\nThe  manuscript is finished. All that\u2019s left is to begin final layout and art direction, proofing of the finished book, and this puppy will be ready for release! We anticipate the final book to 400+ pages in length!\n   Interface Zero 2.0 is a cyberpunk setting\u2026Sort of. Interface Zero is inspired by a plethora of sources including novels such as Neuromancer, Mona Lisa Overdrive, Burning Chrome, Count Zero, Altered Carbon, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, and Snow Crash.\nAnime such as Akira, Cowboy Bebop, Psycho Pass, Ghost in the Shell, Battle Angel Alita and Appleseed help to round out a vision of our world, incorporating eastern and western influences on the genre.\nThe result is a setting that echoes other popular cyberpunk games, but focuses more on geopolitical intrigue and action rather than the familiar roles of megacorporations as the major antagonists. That doesn\u2019t mean that corporations aren\u2019t powers unto themselves, with their own agendas, both altruistic and nefarious, however.\nThe characters you play in Interface Zero take on a variety of roles. Hackers, drone jockeys, government agents, bounty hunters (just to name a few) generally act as private operators; people with the skills, ability and will to do jobs nobody else can. The jobs often skirt the edges of legality, and can push your moral compass away from true north, if you let them.\nAlternately,  you might work exclusively for a corporate entity, a world government, or even as special operations teams similar to Ghost in the Shell\u2019s Section 9, working to protect the citizens of the sprawl, or even corporate assets. For the military-minded player, characters might become mercenaries working in war zones with occupying armies or resistance movements.\n  Set in the year 2090, Interface Zero 2.0 peers into a dark future, imagining a world changed by Eco-terrorism, unimpeded global warming, and nuclear war. Chinese imperialism has erased national boundaries from Eastern Russia all the way down to Vietnam and Thailand. The world has seen the rise and fall of global super powers. China, Brazil and the Central African Union have risen to global prominence, while the United States has disintegrated, splitting into five new nations; Atlantica, the Great Lakes Union, the North American Coalition, the Republic of Cascadia, and the Republic of Texas.\nIn this grim reality, we have colonized the solar system and sold it to the highest bidder. Colonies and orbital habitats on other planets, while claimed by nations on earth, are in truth the property of massive, multi-planet corporations. Commonly known as \u201czeroes,\u201d many people living in the reaches of space have seen their adventurous spirit, their hopes for an exciting life beyond the confines of Earth, crushed under the weight of indentured servitude after signing on with these corporations. The corps promise to pay relocation expenses and living expenses, and then use technicalities and clauses in the contracts to recoup those expenses.\nThe corporation owns everything; even the air zeroes breathe comes at a cost, deducted from their weekly paychecks. There are those, however, who have found ways to survive, and even thrive in the outer-reaches of space, living on the fringes of law and civilization. Will you join them?\nScience has hacked the genome, unlocking the secrets of DNA to facilitate the creation of new breeds of human; genetic hybrids, human 2.0, and even simulacrum\u2014a slave race grown in amniotic vats and sold on the open market.\nCybernetic technology has reached the point where those with the credits and the will to do so, can become living machines.\nComputer science has grown rapidly as well. Dubbed Interface Zero by those who created it, the Tendril Access Processor\u2014or TAP\u2014downloads the Global DataNet and Hyper Reality directly into the minds of billions of users across the solar system, bringing the world an unparalleled level of inter connectivity, and danger. Malware plagues the Deep, and black hat hackers manipulate the Tendril Access Processor to upload malicious Virii, steal secrets, and even the identities of the unwary.\nWelcome to the future. Let's hope you survive it.\n This project has been in development for two and a half years, and we believe the new rules for hacking, combat, and piloting drones are innovative, uniquely reflect the setting and highlight the power of the Pathfinder game system. With 16 character classes, seven races that redefine what it means to be human, new feats, tons of gear and cybernetics, your options for character creation are endless.\n   Starfinder is coming next year, and we can\u2019t wait to see the awesomeness that the Paizo crew are developing! But what does that mean for Interface Zero? Greatness, to be sure. You can rest assured that once the rules for Starfinder become available for licensed publishers, we will work to ensure that Interface Zero: Cyberpunk action for Pathfinder is fully compatible with that rule set. Indeed, this book is already compatible with the Technology Guide.\nThe only question is exactly how to go about it. We are, of course, printing Interface Zero. Logic would dictate waiting until we can update the book with the new rules, but I don\u2019t want you to have to wait to get your rewards until after Starfinder has been released. That leaves me with another option; releasing a conversion document that gives you everything you\u2019ll need to make characters with the Starfinder rules.\nThe conversion document will initially be a free PDF that you\u2019ll all get standard with your rewards, and depending on how things go, I may offer it as a Print on Demand product at DrivethruRPG. I haven\u2019t decided yet. Either way we\u2019ll have you covered!\n  In this book you'll find:\nA detailed look at the dystopian future that is Earth in the year 2090.\nSeven core races, including androids, cyborgs, and the genetically superior human 2.0.\nSixteen core classes. Dominate combat with the mysterious cybermonk. Use the hacker to lay bare the secrets of corporations and governments. Play a zeek and use your psionic powers to wipe out your enemies, or steal their thoughts.\nA streamlined alternative combat system based on the rules in Ultimate Combat that offer a gritty, cyberpunk play style.\nNew rules for hacking and dealing with Hyper Reality, a virtual overlay of the real world you can use to hack the world around you.\nA plethora of high-tech gear for your characters. Guns, armor, vehicles, cybernetic implants and more are available, if you've got the creds.\nRobots and other technological horrors, designed by RPG Superstar Mike Welham.\nRules for drones, and remotely piloted robotic armaments.\nWe\u2019re keeping this project very simple. To start, we\u2019ll have four pledge levels you can choose from, but as the kickstarter progresses and we unlock more stretch goals, I\u2019ll add special pledges which allow you to back for extra stuff and become a part of the setting!\n           Here's a list of the available add-ons: If you want to grab these, just add the extra dollar amounts to your pledge.\nPrint book: You can get an extra copy of Interface Zero: Cyberpunk Action for the Pathfinder RPG for 20.00\nMiniatures: You can grab a mini for 4 dollars a piece.\nPrint Vouchers: Print vouchers allow you to get a copy of the Print on demand versions of any books we unlock in our stretch goals. Here's how it works:\nBy pledging an extra 10 dollars, you get a Print Voucher to buy the book at cost +shipping. Once it's ready for Print on Demand, I'll send you a discount link you can use to get your copy. At 90 pages, the books will cost $4.61 (plus shipping) to print in full color, soft cover.\nHere are the available books we have so far.\nThe Golemmech Creation Rules: This book will give you everything you need to use battle mechs in your game. We'll have combat rules, customization rules, plenty of mechs to choose from, and possibly even a character class: The mech pilot.\nThe Malmart Catalog: This book will provide tons of new gear, weapons, armor, drones, and vehicles for use in your Interface Zero campaign.\nThe Zero's Guide to the Solar System: This book will flesh out the solar system, providing tons of information on colonies, orbital habitats, and the people who live on them.\nThe New York Reclamation Zone: Once the greatest city on earth, New York was abandoned in 2038 after terrorists blew the levees protecting her from rising sea levels. Forgotten by America, the Big Apple became soggy, slowly rotting away, with only a brave few remaining within its bounds, refusing to give up their once-proud home. Yet in the half-century that followed, New Yorkers proved time and again just how adaptable they could be in the face of disaster, natural or otherwise.\nNow, the waters may still hold the Big Soggy hostage, but its denizens reject any notion of surrender. The city has changed, with flooded streets and ancient subways teeming with aquatic predators while human colonies scrape out a brutal existence on those skyscrapers that haven\u2019t collapsed into the sea. As corporations turn their hungry eyes on the forgotten city, it\u2019s time to rediscover the Big Soggy, where new territory is being fought over, new hybrids are emerging from the waves, new technology is being manufactured in the blackest labs, and new secrets are being dug up from the ocean floor\u2014or buried there.\nThreats of 2090: This source book will give you tons of new threats to include in your game.\nOur stretch goals are designed to improve the quality of the book, add more artwork, and more content, including source books for the setting! Here\u2019s an outline of what we have planned.\nAdversaries: Need I say more? RPG Superstar Mike Welham will create more threats to use in your games!\nHot Spots: Hot Spots introduce a unique location to a given city across the world. They provide you with places to go, new NPC\u2019s to meet, and sometimes even special items, like weapons, tech, or even cutting-edge cybernetics! Each Hot Spot will also provide adventure seeds. Hot Spots will be available for backers as individual pdfs to start, but once we get enough (minimum 24 pages worth of material), I\u2019ll compile them into a single printed book. All backers at 40.00 or higher will get a print copy of the book!\nSource Material: We're going to be doing source books, and rules supplements that give you more content!\n     Shipping costs to regions outside the United States can be extremely high in most cases, which makes it tough to successfully fund a kickstarter or hit stretch goals. I completely understand the dilemma International backers face. You love the project, and want to pledge, but you don\u2019t want to take out a second mortgage on your home just to pay the shipping costs.\nI\u2019ve been doing my due diligence, and I\u2019ve found a solution: Gamesquest!\nHere's their bio:\nGamesQuest is one of the fastest growing Fulfilment companies in the EU, offering a great a service for a competitive price. At GamesQuest we pride ourselves on being hobbyists, with a real passion to see the industry grow and prosper. With years of experience shipping games and collectables worldwide GamesQuest are committed to offering a reliable and safe shipping solution for Kickstarters large and small alike!\nJames Mathe, of Minion Games, recently reviewed us as:\n\"These guys have been very friendly, very responsive, and obviously, speak very good English.\" \"Their customer service dealt with customers directly in a timely manner and they helped quickly resolve the issues we caused ourselves.\"\nBacker Kit\nFor this kickstarter, I'm going to be using Backerkit to collect shipping fees after the kickstarter ends. The reason is simple. Kickstarter has not yet found a way to separate the funds that actually go towards the money we need to raise, and the shipping costs needed to send out the finished product.\nThe result from this oversight, is an artificially inflated \u201ctotal\u201d amount of money raised, which causes huge problems when determining which funds go where. Money which is dedicated towards the development decreases because we suddenly find ourselves compensating for shipping and handling. As an example, the Interface Zero Savage Worlds kickstarter lost over 16,000 dollars because of shipping costs, which resulted in a reduced budget! It hurt me financially as I struggled to compensate for the lost funds.\nBy using Backerkit, I can avoid this by keeping the shipping fees held separately until I'm ready to ship. Once I'm ready to ship you will be charged for shipping one last time, and rewards will be sent.\nClick here for more information about Backerkit.\nCheck the following chart to see the estimated costs for international shipping.

He has worked on the psionics rules for Interface Zero Pathfinder Edition.\nDavid Jarvis\nDavid has been working in the table top industry for just over 11 years. During this time, his company\u2014Gun Metal Games\u2014has produced over 140 books in both print and PDF.

He\u2019s successfully funded three previous kickstarters, and has learned from each of them.

He has an extensive list of writing credits with Frog God Games, Kobold Press, Legendary Games, Louis Porter Jr. Design, and Rogue Genius Games, among others.\nMike Welham\nMike Welham been gaming off-and-on for over 30 years but only recently gave back to his beloved hobby. He has freelanced for Kobold Press, Paizo, Raging Swan Press, and Rite Publishing, and he won Paizo\u2019s RPG Superstar contest in 2012. Mike lives in Kernersville, North Carolina, with his ever-patient wife, a puggle, too many cats, and a turtle. He believes the solution to his current empty nest syndrome is to allow more creatures of his imagination to make themselves at home. He was delighted to have the opportunity to design bizarre technological horrors for the Interface Zero project.\nRobert Hudson\nRobert H. Hudson Jr is a two-time ENNIE nominee game developer and writer who has worked in the industry since 2005.

He lives in Alabama, where he works, runs games, writes, and ponders the mysteries of the universe.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs someone who has been publishing role-playing game supplements since 2005, I can attest to the fact that things don't always go as planned. Writers and artists pull out of projects, or turn in manuscripts and illustrations late. Editing and revisions sometimes take longer than anticipated. The proofs for books come back from the printer with errors that need to be fixed.\nThese things can happen. It's a part of the publishing business. But I've been around the block, and I know that a large part of dealing with issues like the ones I mentioned above is communication.\nI have regular conversations with everyone involved in this process to ensure that I know things are progressing the way they should be, and if they aren't, I roll up my sleeves and work with my team to find the best solution to a problem before it gets out of hand.\n\nAs a backer, you'll receive regular status reports from me about this project.

He has penned six supplements for the HackMaster game system, including the adventures \"Mugful of Mayhem\" and \"Shadow Over Tiwidu.\" When asked about his approach to game-mastery, William stated, \"If your players are not physically limping away from the table at the end of the night, you may as well hang up your dice bag.\"  \nBrian Berg is the creative force behind TPK Games, and is adding additional levels of danger and depth to the adventures. Brian has contributed to several 5-Star adventures such as 'The Bleeding Hollow' and 'The Fen of the Five-Fold Maw.'\nWhat does print on demand at cost mean?  \nWhen these adventures are complete and ready for release, you will receive a link from DriveThruRPG to the print on demand copy at the manufacturer's cost. You'll pay DriveThruRPG an estimated $10 + shipping to your location and they will print and ship to you directly a full color copy of the book.\nWhy do this you ask?  Well, for one, TPK Games is a small operation.  Having our team focused on creating instead of shipping and inventory means you'll get your product much faster.  Also, this model allows us to keep the shipping costs down FAR lower than what we could if we printed them ourselves and shipped them individually through the USPS.

Risk and Challenges, it would seem, are not concepts you consider intimidating. It is only fair, therefore, that we attempt to match your perseverance, and admit our own shortcomings and limitations. After all, should you choose to cast aside your own safety for the sake of The Orphans, the least we can do is tell you how we, personally, may well screw this up for you and for them.\n\nBeing skillful and unapologetic pessimists, we have assumed few to none would be foolish enough to back this doomed venture. As such, a base funding goal of $4,097 was set, a minuscule pittance for some, but a seemingly insurmountable goal for The Orphans. \n\nShipping, of course, would be entrusted to the good people at USPS, UPS, or, depending on the final funding amount, a fulfillment company.\n\nEndangered Orphans will use EU friendly shipping. Alternatively, the value of the game will be listed at a reduced sales cost, matching the reward level you may have chosen, allowing the minimum threshold for Import duty and VAT to be charged in many countries. Of course, we can't assure an unpleasant plague, insidious virus, or fluid-sapping arachnids won't also hitch a ride with the packages, as they all want to do. But, again, you aren't one to concern yourself with petty risks.\n\nEndangered Orphans of Condyle Cove has been painstakenly, even painfully, playtested by groups ranging in age from far too old to care to far too young to understand. Though not all were completely enthralled by the activities, not one person broke out in any form or rash, expired from mysterious causes, or found fit to physically assault or belittle us, and thus we feel comfortable saying that, at the very least, that it plays as promised and is unlikely to cause you death, though far be it from us to jinx anything. \n\nFurthermore, all of the artwork, accessories, and pre-press deliverables have been completed and the final game is ready to be manufactured at the very moment the campaign concludes, a rare show of optimism on our part. In keeping with that uncharacteristic idealism, we feel that the full, fast, incident free delivery of all pre-stretch goal deliverables is within reach. \n\nIn the event of a legitimate miracle that allows us to reach any of our preposterous stretch goals, we will unquestionably provide constant and detailed updates on not only our steps to assure full and pleasant delivery of the promised rewards, but also of our utter and complete shock and humble outpouring of gratitude and indebtedness. Also, perhaps, our in-depth investigation into who may be behind such a cruel hoax. \n\nIn summation, we feel that there is nothing we have promised that we can not deliver, if in fact we find that others, like you, so choose to put your own happiness on hold for the sake of imaginary, illustrated Orphans. \n \nBless you all, and good luck.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "THE \u201cLEAST WE CAN DO\u201d LEVEL", "descp": "For those asking \u201cwhat\u2019s the LEAST I can do to help The Orphans?\u201d, here is your answer.

We have specialized teams for jacket design, jewelry design, Bluetooth & NFC research, wearable technology, smartphone accessories and production that work collaboratively to design and produce creative and smart technology products of HALLAM P NEW YORK.   Our CEO, Hallam Park, majored in design and for the last 15 years he has been a designer and a creator. The motto of his work has been to provide a happier, healthier, and more convenient life for people who are exhausted from living busy lives. Park has put his passion and creativity into numerous product designs, turning 10 of them into patents. During his work, he experienced the inconvenience of having to use a smartphone for virtually everything in our society and started working on a design that could compensate for the mental stress and inconvenience smartphone causes. After 2 years of tremendous effort and research, world\u2019s first smart jacket was released for both iPhone and android users.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHALLAM NEW YORK smart jacket is nearly completed.

It\u2019s about humanity, and how those among us who are the most obsessed have the power to alter reality until it aligns with their fevered desires. It\u2019s about getting what you want despite others trying to keep it from you.\nUnknown Armies presents magick as it might exist in a world co-created by Tim Powers and James Ellroy, as twisting wrinkles in reality created by greater and greater risk, sacrifice, and obsession. In Unknown Armies we ask, what would you risk to change the world? Your friends? Your family? Your health? Your sanity? Magick finds a way to ask the very most from you, until you achieve what you want or you are left with nothing.\nUnknown Armies lets you play one of these characters. Resolve your character's actions through the luck of percentile dice. Track your character's emotional response to significant forms of trauma and shock. Try to accomplish a self-assigned objective or goal in order to get what you want. As part of a cabal, your character helps others to achieve their own goals, as well as a group objective that can \u2014 and will \u2014 have long-lasting consequences when it is met.\nCo-created by Greg Stolze and John Tynes, Unknown Armies presents an entirely original and yet disturbingly familiar approach to mystery, horror, and action in roleplaying games. This new edition, helmed by Stolze, also features the diverse talents of a cabal of contributors: Cam Banks, Tim Dedopulos, Shoshana Kessock, Sophie Lagac\u00e9, Chris Lites, W.J. MacGuffin, Ryan Macklin, Chad Underkoffler, Monica Valentinelli, and Filamena Young. \nSometimes the occult underground is literally underground. Sometimes it's not.\nHere at Atlas Games we love Unknown Armies. Fans love it, too. We want to bring it back. It's a beloved roleplaying game that created ripples throughout the tabletop community when it first came out in 1998, and again in 2002.\nThis Kickstarter campaign is all about taking that game \u2014 a game that has inspired, disturbed, and excited gamers for almost twenty years \u2014 and updating it for a new generation and a new era.\nWe need your help to do this. Change won't happen without broad consensus. Reality won't twist without the focused expression of your collective will. This is Unknown Armies Third Edition.\nUnknown Armies consists of three books presented together as a complete set. Initially softcover, we expect to upgrade them to beautiful case bound volumes in a slipcase once certain stretch goals are met. The books are:\nBook One: Play\u2014The book for players.\nAll of the rules for resolving actions\nThe central shock gauge mechanic\nObsession and identity\nAvoiding fights and then dealing with them when you end up being dragged into them anyway\nThe magick of adepts and avatars\nBook Two: Run\u2014The book for the Game Moderator.\nPresenting the players and their characters with obstacles to their fevered dreams of changing the world\nProcedures for overseeing character creation and setting collaboration in the first session of play\nPlenty of background on the world of the occult underground\nBook Three: Reveal\u2014The book of the weird.\nFuel for the Game Moderator: packed with ideas, hooks, tidbits, scraps, lies, truths, and horrors\nWhat's heresy and what's just hearsay?\nFreaky Game Moderator characters, locations, creatures, and events\nEven more magick\nAn example interior spread (not final)\nInterior spread without splash chapter opening (not final)\nBy backing this project at the $10 level or greater, you get early access to drafts of the three books in their raw, dangerous state. Look for the link in the first backer update. With these documents also come access to the Gamma playtest of this edition, which means we want your feedback about the game before we seal the deal with the Invisible Clergy, AKA our talented production team.\nWe are funded!\nWe've got you covered.\nPublishing three full-color, beautifully illustrated, expertly crafted softcover books is certainly appealing, but we want more for this game, and we want you to help us get there. Here is what we plan to do with backer funds that exceed the initial target set for the campaign.\n$50,000: Hardcover Upgrade - FUNDED!\nWe upgrade all three books to casebound volumes with soft-touch laminate covers. This is a free upgrade to anyone who gets the books in print.\n$75,000: Deluxe Set Magnetic Slipcase - FUNDED!\nWe add a Deluxe Set option, which is the three books in a full-color slipcase with magnetic clasp. The slipcase unfolds to serve as a full-function Game Moderator screen.

Added as bonus content to all tiers from CHECKER upwards.\n$160,000: Book Four Grows to 96 Pages - FUNDED!\nWe unlock the final set of chains on Greg Stolze and lock his full talent upon Book Four: Expose, increasing it to a total of 96 pages in PDF and EPUB for all backers eligible to receive bonus ebook content.\n$180,000: Add Book Five as Bonus Digital Content - FUNDED!\nAs we delve into the occult underground we uncover new and diverse rituals, organizations, archetypes, and magickal phenomena. This stretch goal unlocks Book Five: Mine, which includes expanded game content in PDF and EPUB for all those eligible to receive bonus ebook content at no additional cost. Written by Unknown Armies adepts Chris Lites and Tim Dedopulos.\n$190,000: New Book Five Author: Filamena Young - FUNDED!\nWe draft UA writer Filamena Young to tear the band-aid from a new set of rituals for Book Five: Mine, extending it to 48 pages.\n$195,000: New Book Five Author: Ryan Macklin - FUNDED!\nWe take Ryan Macklin, UA writer from the Internet, and lock him in a chamber of small animals until he hands over an additional 16 pages of material for Book Five: Mine, bringing it to a total of 64 pages.\n$200,000: New Book Five Author: Chad Underkoffler - FUNDED!\nCatching sight of UA writer Chad Underkoffler trying to escape, we strap him in and extract an additional 16 pages for Book Five: Mine, for your eventual enjoyment, bringing it to a total of 80 pages.\n$210,000: Soundtrack Cycle 2 - FUNDED!\nWe return to the orchestral forge of James Semple to commission an additional 15-minute composition of Unknown Armies\u2013inspired music to collide with your willing senses.\n$215,000: New Book Five Author: WJ MacGuffin - FUNDED!\nWe summon the spiritual essence of WJ MacGuffin, UA writer and scribe, to embody a mint condition Western Digital Pascal MicroEngine WD900 installed within an oak box just long enough to produce 16 more pages for Book Five: Mine.

These digital-only products contain everything you need to get an Unknown Armies campaign started:\nFive pregenerated characters, broken and damaged and ready to go\nOne group objective for the cabal to pursue\nA first session scenario to get things moving quickly\nGM hooks, additional objective ideas, GMCs, and suggestions for your aggressive GM planner sessions\nEvery backer who has pledged at a tier that provides bonus ebook content or bonus digital content gets these at no additional cost.

You can thank (or blame) him for several of the new schools of magick in third edition, as well as the pile of free fiction he\u2019s gradually accrued at www.gregstolze.com/fiction_library.

He got his start in the gaming industry by writing articles for Dragon Magazine while he was still in high school. His writing paid his way through college, and he started Atlas Games in 1990 while he was still pursuing his BA in Philosophy at Carleton College, as a way to publish his own work.\nJohn manages the business side of Atlas Games, handling distributor and retailer orders and queries, fulfillment (i.e., packing boxes), accounts payable and receivable, translation queries, and even a little layout and proofreading once in a while. Somehow, it turned out that he hasn't actually published much of his own work, since he kept finding amazing works like Unknown Armies to publish instead.\nOn the road to a better, more productive occult life.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAtlas Games is a well-established publisher with a 25-year track record.

Greg's work on the manuscript is all but complete, and none of the remaining members of the production team are irreplaceable in the event of a serious illness or similar misfortune.\n\nThe greatest risks involved in this project lie in the uncontrollable schedules of our production partners.

Here\u2019s what just a few of the reviews have said: \n\u201cThe basics of the Cypher System are as equally brilliant as they are simple.\u201d\n\u201cA real joy, taking the emergent gameplay of mechanically complex RPGs and blending them with the narrative flow of new-school games.\u201d \n\u201cThe Cypher System Rulebook is a master-class product that manages to become one of the most accessible generic rules I\u2019ve had a chance to see.\u201d \n\u201cMakes life really easy for the GM!\u201d \n\u201cEasy to learn, quick to play\u2026designed and custom tailored for\u2014anything you want to do!\u201d \nThe Cypher System Rulebook came out last summer, and now we want to take it to the next level. (Don\u2019t have the Cypher System Rulebook yet? It's available now, or you can get it through this Kickstarter campaign as an add-on or through the NEW TO THE CYPHER SYSTEM backer level.) We\u2019re creating a suite of support titles\u2014including three complete campaign settings\u2014that will give you at least two years\u2019 worth of awesome Cypher System gaming! \nHere\u2019s a little bit about why we\u2019re Kickstarting. If this isn\u2019t interesting to you, skip down to the next section and I\u2019ll talk a bit about what we want to make for you! \nA couple of years ago, after the amazingly successful launch of Numenera, we were working on The Strange, our next RPG. It was based on the same game engine\u2014the Cypher System. As Monte and Bruce worked on The Strange, they found that converting Numenera\u2019s rules to a new game\u2014even a game with an infinite number of micro-settings in almost every imaginable genre\u2014worked really well. Which got us thinking: Why not make those rules available for you to run your own campaigns, in any setting of your choice?\nThis was the genesis of the Cypher System Rulebook. At that time, though, we were still thinking this would be a minor release\u2014probably just a 160-page rulebook with little more than the existing core rules. But as Monte worked on the CSR, he kept finding more and more ways to make it better. The book\u2019s specs kept growing: A 224-page hardcover. A 320-pager. \nThe more Monte worked on it\u2014and the more we ran our own Cypher System adventures and campaigns\u2014the more we realized how awesome this book could be. By this time last year we\u2019d grown it into a full-sized, 416-page hardcover corebook. \nFor well over a year now, we\u2019ve been running our own Cypher System games. Horror. Superheroes. Space opera and hard science-fiction. Even dungeon crawls. And some of us have started building and running more unique standalone settings. Just as it took us a few months and some hands-on work realizing the Cypher System deserved full-fledged corebook treatment, we\u2019ve also come to realize that the CSR deserves full-fledged game line support. \nIf we\u2019d been thinking this way from the beginning, we would have Kickstarted the CSR. Why? \nA Kickstarter campaign lets us do things we can\u2019t do for a product\u2014or a line\u2014that goes to market in the conventional manner. We can reach for stretch goals that improve the product. We can add new titles. We learn from your feedback about what you like most in the product, and can tailor it accordingly. And we can take risks on things we think are really cool\u2014but that we couldn\u2019t gamble on in the old-fashioned publishing methods. Because we sort of evolved our way into it, we didn\u2019t do that for the Cypher System Rulebook. \nBut there\u2019s no time like the present!\nWe want to help you run great Cypher System campaigns. The place to start is, of course, the Cypher System Rulebook if you don't already have that. But we also want to give you new tools for making those games awesome and taking them into even more realms of play. We want to bring our vision for some cool settings to life, to fire your imagination for roleplaying games that go beyond what you\u2019ve seen before. We have a ton of ideas, and if this campaign goes like some of our previous campaigns, we think we\u2019ll be able to offer even more than our starting point. \nThe old gods are dead. Burning and crumbling, the divine realm dropped from the sky and smashed into the world like a vengeful star. The earth was plunged into darkness. Hope shriveled. Life has become cheap, brutal, and short. But from the ashes of this catastrophe, you can awaken your own divine spark. Claim a dominion; declare yourself the god of War, of the Hunt, of Winter, of Fire, or of the realm of your choice. And if you can complete your divine labors, fulfill prophecy, and throw down the despots that rose in place of the fallen gods, you might redeem a world fallen into evil. You might truly become\u2014a god! \nThis 192-page hardcover is epic fantasy of the highest order, but with the creative twists you expect from Monte Cook Games. Gods of the Fall is already written and in editing, and will ship in June. It does not rely on the success of this Kickstarter to be released\u2014although we do hope this campaign will allow some cool upgrades to the book through stretch goals. \nAn asteroid will soon wipe out all life on earth. You know this\u2014and you know when\u2014because it\u2019s in the history books your grandparents brought back to the Cretaceous period with them. Now your small society is trapped in prehistory, desperate to find a way back to your time. But at least you're not alone. You have tech, weapons, vehicles, and science from the future\u2014you even have the ability to bioengineer the dinosaurs around you. Can you use these tools to survive a dangerous world on the brink of extinction? \nIs that the sound of thunder you hear? \nPredation will be a 192-page hardcover. Like the other campaign settings funded by this campaign, it\u2019ll have setting info, new character options, creatures, cyphers, and everything you need to run a complete campaign.\nWhen they locked you up, you made the mask. When you wear it, you can do the impossible. Just like the comic books.\nBut the mask has always done more: It shows a world beyond the everyday grey skein of cities and people. Something golden and perfect. But the longer you wear it, the more your old self slips away. It's like drowning. But the power calls to you.\nThere are others like you, good, bad and indifferent. All searching for what they call Magonia\u2014the place from their ruined childhoods, where they once escaped from this broken down world. And they all know, as you know, that something terrible is coming.\nUnmasked is 192 pages of super-powered psychological horror. Like the other campaign settings funded by this campaign, it\u2019ll have setting info, new character options, creatures, cyphers, and everything you need to run a complete campaign.\nThe Asset Deck adds a whole new dimension to Cypher System gameplay. Assets are things that help you in completing tasks. They represent the circumstances being in your favor, the perfect tool for the job, and so on. Each card in this 100-card deck has the details of one such asset that a GM can award to a player and that the player can in turn choose to play at any time. Maybe a PC needs to talk her way out of being arrested by the police, and so the player plays the \"Perfect One-Liner\" card, suggesting that the character recalls that perfect joke at the perfect time, thus making the task easier. Or maybe a PC needs to pilot a starship through an asteroid field. The player plays the \"It's Like I've Been Here Before\" card, suggesting that he's either flown through it before, or seen a map or diagram in the past. These cards don't guarantee success, but they put some ability in the players' hands to control their fate.\nAnd More? \nWhat if we hit some stretch goals? In our previous campaigns, stretch goals have allowed us to add additional titles to the lineup, and we\u2019re hoping to do the same thing in this campaign. Among many other ideas, we\u2019d like to expand upon the content in the Cypher System Rulebook, add some support for The Strange\u2014and maybe even build upon the fiction line we launched in the Into the Ninth World Kickstarter campaign.\nMost of the backer levels to the right contain one or both of these packages.\nAll the Ebooks: You receive all the books funded by this campaign in PDF format, along with a PDF version of the Asset Deck. If we unlock new books as stretch goals, those PDFs are added to your rewards automagically!\nAll the Print Books: You receive all the print books funded by this campaign, as well as the Asset Deck in print. If we unlock new print books as stretch goals, you get them as part of your reward. Please see the shipping information, below. (International backers: Please be aware that international shipping is expensive. We subsidize a portion of your shipping, and you can bundle your rewards to save even more. But be sure to read the shipping section, below.)\nAdd-ons are rewards that you add to your existing reward level. Simply increase your pledge by the appropriate amount. Check out our pledge calculator; it\u2019ll help you figure out exactly how much to pledge based on the backer level and add-ons you desire.\nYou can find more details about all of our add-ons at the pledge calculator.\nAfter the campaign ends, we\u2019ll get in touch with you about the extra money you pledged and what it was for. Some of these add-ons items are only available through this Kickstarter campaign\u2014if you want them, be sure to add them to your pledge now!\nWe offer a variety of backer levels with some great rewards. The reward level details on the right can\u2019t be edited once a campaign is underway, but we can make changes to the words you\u2019re reading now\u2014so the notes below are up to date, including upgrades or additions we may make to the backer levels as the campaign progresses.\nULTIMATE CYPHER GM: Run your game with efficiency and style! Dice, the XP Deck, and a laminated GM quick-reference sheet keep things moving quickly at your game table.

These three are not only great GMs, but in the Predation and Unmasked games, you'll be able to provide feedback that will shape the finished product. Gods of the Fall will be out by Gen Con, but the other titles will still be in development, so these will be actual playtest games.

And perhaps a few additional items you can use in your game, hand-picked by the designer. We can't tell you exactly what you'll get\u2014we won't know until design is complete, and it will vary by designer\u2014but you can count on it being cool and utterly unique. And we'll send it all to you in a special keepsake box suitable for storing your own campaign materials as well.

Duties are not included in your shipping charge.\nYou can mitigate shipping costs by waiting to have several titles shipped at once, if you like. We guarantee that each reward will be available for a minimum period of one year from its official release date.\nShow your support for this campaign, and help spread the word\u2014the way we reach stretch goals is to get the word out to more potential backers. And every stretch goal makes our journey into the worlds of the Cypher System that much more exciting!

We offer a versatile broad array of alternatives and options for players and Game Masters. The setting focuses on defeating ancient evils, rediscovering of the world of Exodus and geopolitical intrigue based in a magical setting. NeoExodus brings to players and GMs new races and with unique alternative racial options and highly advanced magics that are almost impossible to differentiate from advanced technologies.\nNeoExodus has been described by its creator, Louis Porter Jr, as his fantasy love letter to the science fiction masterpiece, Babylon 5. Others have compared the mixture of fantasy and science fiction elements to be similar to those found in cult classic cartoon series like He-Man and the Master of the Universe to Thundercats and CrossGen comic books Scion and Sojourn. Some of the realistic aspects and feelings of the setting of NeoExodus are based off of real world events while embracing the possibilities for fantasy.\nLouis Porter Jr. Design\nNeoExodus was created, implemented, expanded and developed by many of the most well know Pathfinder Role Playing Game developers including Neal Bailey, Thomas Baumbach, JP Chapleau, Joshua Cole, Richard Farrese, Lee Hammock, Jeff Lee, Jonathan Palmer, David Ross, Amber Scott, Owen K.C. Stephens, Adam Wells, Benjamin Wenham, Linda Weygant-Robison and myself, Louis Porter, Jr.\nWhat is your money going to?\nWhat we have created, at the most basic of levels, is an update and revision of our NeoExodus Campaign setting. This new book will be at least 175 pages in length for this unique setting. The money that we raise will go for the additional cost of generating art, new written material and editing, and the general updated quality of production of the product. Louis Porter Jr. Design\u2019s goal is to present you with a complete and unique world for NeoExodus in the similar tradition of TSR and Wizard of the Coast's fan favorite campaign settings like Dragonlance, Forgotten Realms and even the more unique setting of Ebberon. As we reach our currently planned stretch goals, we will be attaching all new ones to this project to bring on even more excitement and prestige.\nAs we reach our currently planned stretch goals we will be attaching all new ones to this project to bring on even more excitement and prestige to this project.

These legendary manuscripts are akin to the Viking bible. Written roughly 1000 years ago, they immortalize the culture and society of the northmen.\nIf you are new to Viking mythology, you'll find everything you're looking for between these covers. If if you're a veteran and have several translations of the Eddas already, you will find wondrous new epics that bridge all of the gaps and inconsistencies which exist within the originals.\nThe Illuminated Edda is a faithful homage to both the Prose and Poetic Eddas. The narrative will retell the contents of both books, along with additional tales that fill in the many gaps that exist within the myths. Instead of a stuffy academic translation, you can expect entertaining contemporary language that grips you and doesn't let go. The Illuminated Edda will contain beautiful full-colour artwork on each and every page. This book will tell the tales of the gods, the giants and many other wondrous beings who inhabit the world tree Yggdrasil- from the creation myths all the way to Ragnarok, the twilight of the gods.\nWe fell in love with these texts over 20 years ago, and after writing several books and designing games based on the myths, we feel it's time to release our opus: The Illuminated Edda.\nWithin the Illuminated Edda you can expect the Prose Edda's Gylfaginning as well as over 30 poems from the Poetic Edda.\nThe Illuminated Edda also includes new sagas that tell the complete story. Wondered about the world before Ymir? How did the Aesir-Vanir war unfold? Why are the Dvergar ignoring the Norn prophesies? You will find maps of the realms as well as full sized pantheons for all of the divine races: Aesir, Vanir, Rime Jotun, Muspeli Jotuns, and Dvergar.\nThese new stories are written with the utmost care so that they blend in perfectly with the existing body of Viking epics.\nThe Illuminated Edda is being written by Andrew Valkauskas. Andrew has studied Viking history and mythology for over 20 years. The Eddas have been his muse and inspiration, and now he'd like to honour them with a pull-out-all-the-stops printing. Andrew has released a series of games (role playing games and card games) based on the Viking sagas. The Fate of the Norns RPG has seen 4 editions over the last 20 years, with the latest incarnations using Futhark rune sets instead of dice. The Gulveig card game is all about bidding, bluffing and scoring your way to victory. This year Andrew will be publishing 4 books: Seith and Sword, Horn of the Kraken, The Illuminated Edda and Lords of the Ash.\nAndrew collects everything Viking related. He even scooped up Thor's hammer Mjolnir from the Dvergar Aaleks... shhh don't tell Thor!\nThe Illuminated Edda is being illustrated by Natasa Ilincic, a Croatian artist currently based in northern Italy. After graduating in classical studies she\u2019s now graduating in Archaeology and devoting her spare time to art. She has been following her passion for painting since she was a little girl, trying to keep her inner child always awake. In 2011 she published her first work, illustrating \u201cThe heirs of Bastet\u201d by Elena Romanello; her works have been published in books and magazines (Circle Magazine, The Celtic Connection) and she\u2019s worked on several Fate of the Norns projects (Gulveig, Denizens of the North, The Illuminated Edda). She\u2019s also author of \u201cAgana\u201d, an illustrated story based on north Italian folklore. \nArt Nouveau, Pre-Raphaelites, neoclassical and victorian artists have always been an inspiration for her, and as a panentheist pagan many of her works are focused on nature, mythology, folklore, the feminine. Her weapon of choice is watercolour (often mixed with acrilics, ink, pastels) but she occasionally also works with digital media.\nFate of the Norns is our game line steeped in Viking history and mythology. For those who wish to explore some table-top entertainment along with their Illuminated Edda, we offer the boxed set as a reward tier. It includes everything we've ever released along with 5 sets of sunning and authentic metal Futhark rune sets.\nThe illuminated Edda is designed to be the companion lore book to the upcoming Lords of the Ash. Together they will allows your campaigns full access to the realms of the divinities.\nWhen the book is released we will be pricing it at $79.98 CAD ($64.98 USD) for print and $36 CAD ($30 USD) for digital. The general release will be after all backers have had a chance to receive their rewards.\nWe will be using print-on-demand for fulfillment of this Kickstarter. We have used this for the last 4 Kickstarters with great success. By eliminating double shipping and double packing, we are able to reduce the price and we pass on those savings to you. Oh and you also get the rewards sooner!\nOur POD partner is Lightning Source (LSI) and they have POD hubs in both the USA and UK, so shipping will be cheap for both North American and EU backers.\nThese exclusives are only available via/during this Kickstarter:\nAdd +$15 CAD [$12 USD] to your pledge to gain access to the Lords of the Ash BETA.
