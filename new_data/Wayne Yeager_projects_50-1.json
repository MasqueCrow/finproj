They live independent or in small groups near mountain slopes and prefer to hunt at night. \n Models will be delivered via kickstarter messages as digital STL files. We test every model before delivery. Pre-supported versions will be included to the archive.   \nCredits\nWe would like to thank all people, who helped us during creation process and provided us with useful information about the results of test prints. Also we specially want to thank those, who gave us examples of painted miniatures.\nAnimation in trailer was made using Unreal Engine 4 specially for \"The Mines\" series.

So do we. War Games was very fortunate to have partnered with the incredibly talented Justin Redmond of Red Revolt Design for this project, and we couldn't be happier with the way everything turned out. Check out the rest of Justin's work HERE \n\nKicking Tables interview with OMG Nexus and our CEO, Justin Burgess\nBoard's Eye View \n\"If you're looking for a fast, fun push-your-luck game with enough atmosphere to keep you argh-ing throughout its 30 minutes or so playing time, then Rolling Plunder is the treasure you've been craving. And tho', with dice rolling and card flipping, there's inevitably a high luck factor, there are enough opportunities for the calculating captain to play the odds.\"\n\n The Friendly Boardgamer- \n\"Rolling Plunder is a small box card and dice game with straightforward rules that are easy to understand. Players start off with a small, basic ship that improves as the game goes on. Your ship stats determine how many re-rolls you get when pursuing the other ship. I really like the re-roll mechanism and it adds tension and a hint of push your luck when trying attempting to hunt down or defeat another ship. The higher your sail or cannon value the more re-rolls you get.\"\n\nNRN Gaming- \n\"Players can have a lot of fun trying to fight for ships that outclass them. If a player picks up a R.M.S. ship early in the game, going on offense pays off. You can also slowly build up your power while getting a complimentary crew, which seems to be the best \u201csafe\u201d strategy. \u201cZerg Rush\u201d and defense are present, but less applicable in this game, thus Rolling Plunder earns a strong 7.5 strategy score.\"\n\nSolitaire Times-\n\"The game takes place in the 18th century, and the goal is to upgrade your ship to a galleon and then earn more points than your opponents. In the solo mode, you win if you manage to upgrade your ship within 7 turns. After you shuffle the Crew, Ship, and Plunder decks, you place six Crew cards in the middle, face up. You begin with a hand of 2 Plunder cards, one sailor card as your starting crew, and a schooner as your starting ship.\"\n\nWV Gamers-\n\"I really like the concept and the overall straightforward mechanics of the game. Who doesn't like a fun dice chucking pirate game where you are hunting ships, building up your ship and crew, and taking on the Royal Navy.\"\n\n Game Enthus \n Aspie Gamer Girl \nClick here for a downloadable version of the rules!\nCrowdfunding Innovation \nStretch Goals\nOnce our first stretch goal is reached we'll open the next two levels, and our backers will get to chose which option they want to pursue. During the campaign each new level reached will unlock additional choices, all determined by YOU. The first is a custom 1st player marker with the Rolling Plunder and doubloon logo for marking turn order! \nGameplay and Strategy\nRolling Plunder is a mechanically distinct game with a unique combat system. While your ship card's stats are used as the base, it avoids the \"numbers win\" problem of many games that causes an early lead to become a game-winning snowball effect. The dice rolling combat is balanced by the custom die faces, ships' attack and speed stats, and the interaction of Crew and Plunder cards so that players always have the chance to win a fight but a hard-earned advantage still means something.\nThere is also a social element that allows players to play each other as well as the game. Buy plunder from each other, trade captured ships for their Victory Points, form temporary alliances or truces... you can even save an enemy from an impending mutiny! Provided the price is right, of course.\nMany cards have multiple uses and can be saved for defense or used to aggressively pursue a lead. Crew members provide set benefits every turn, or they can be sacrificed for a greater bonus at a key moment. \"Unique Crew\" members are stronger and more valuable, but each pirate can only have one at a time on his or her ship. The Unique Crew you choose can substantially change your play style or which risks you're willing to take. Just choose wisely, or your opponents will overtake you. In the end, only one pirate can become the greatest on the high seas.\nMore product information can be found @ WarGamesLLC.com\n\n\n\nOUR TEAM (drawn by our kick-ass artist Justin Redmond) ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith COVID-19 still sweeping the globe, the War Games team debated for a long time about whether or not to go live, and ultimately decided that this crisis wasn't going to beat us. However with a lot of people tightening their belts and wallets until the crisis is over, we were risking a failed campaign. So we decided that in addition to running the Kickstarter, we're going to give the digital game away for FREE to anyone who backs us, and they'll get the game immediately. So not only will backers be supporting a veteran-owned small business, but they will get the chance to play Rolling Plunder as soon as they join our campaign.\n\nEven if we fail, we will have provided our game to the public and hopefully brought just a little bit of joy to their lives in tough times.\n\nAs for the product and campaign itself, Rolling Plunder will be our 4th Kickstarter and we will be applying the lessons learned from our past 3 successful projects (FUBAR, Blue Falcon, and WTF, Over?) to ensure Rolling Plunder goes above and beyond the high expectations we've already set with our previously satisfied backers.\n\nCreatively, there is also the possibility that the pirate theme is not unique enough to keep interest in our concept.

You will receive the pieces in \"clean\" STL files, in STL files with the supports, and the Chitubox file in case you want to modify any of the supports.\n\n\n\nMEGATERIO (Megatherium americanum) - The Megaterio was a giant ground sloth that could measure up to 6 meters and weigh 5 tons. Standing on its hind legs reaching, the branches high of the trees and feending on fruits and leaves. They were originally from South America. During Great American Biological Interchange (G.A.B.I.) some species migrated to North America shortly before their extinction eight thousand years ago.\nDOEDICURO (Doedicurus clavicaudatus) - The Doedicuro was a great armadillo, 4 meters long, weighing 3 tons, belonging to the Glyptodonts group. It was a South American herbivorous slow. The current armadillos have an articulated carapace.Glyptodonts had rigid carapace. Its shell made it impregnable it also had a long tail provided by large spikes that served as an excellent defensive weapon.\nFORORRACO (Phorusrhacos longissimus) - The Foorracos were giant birds belonging to the group of the so-called terror birds. They measured 2.5 meters and weighed 200 kg. They lived from 15 million years ago until their extinction approximately one million years ago. They inhabited Patagonia and were without a doubt the super-predators of those times. Their reign probably ended when saber-toothed cats from the northern hemisphere arrived in their territories.\nGONFOTERIO (Stegomastodon platensis) - The Gonfoterios was proboscides extinct relatives of the present elephants. They are originating about 12 million years ago in the northern hemisphere and arriving in South America during the G.A.B.I. 1 million years ago, becoming extinct about eight thousand years ago.\nSABER TOOTH (Smilodon populator) - Smilodon populator was the species most powerful of saber-toothed cats. They belonged to the extinct subfamily Machairodontinae, distantly related to current felines. They were originally from the northern hemisphere.From the formation of the Isthmus of Panama, colonized South America approximately 2 million years ago. Their distinguishing feature was their long upper canines. Laterally compressed like daggers would have been very effective in penetrating the tough skin of the large herbivore mammals of the ice age. These characteristics, although, effective would make them quite fragile, so the bite had to be very precise and do when the prey was immobile enough not to expose the teeth to possible breakage.\nTOXODON (Toxodon platensis) - Toxodon platensis was a species belonging to the extinct order Notongulata. Exclusive to South America, Toxodon platensis originated during the Eocene 27 million years ago. It had two large rodent-like curved incisors and lower incisors arranged horizontally like a spatula, which allowed it to feed on tough grasses and shrubs. They became extinct about 10,000 years ago.\nMACRAUQUENIA (Macrauchenia patachonica)- Macrauchenia was a large native South American mammals long-necked, and long-limbed, of three-toed of the disappeared order Litopterna. In life, Macrauchenia may have resembled a humpless camel, nevertheless like other, litopterns it is most closely related to the odd-toed ungulates (Perissodactyla), horses, donkeys, zebras, etc. The oldest fossils in the genus date to the late Miocene, around seven million years ago, and M. patachonica disappears at the end Pleistocene around 10,000 years ago. Charles Darwin discovered one specimen during the voyage of the Beagle. It fed on plants in a variety of environments across what is now South America.\nMARSUPIAL SABER-TOOTH (Thylacosmilus atrox) Thylacosmilus atrox was a highly specialized carnivorous Marsupial species. It was the size of a modern mountain lion.Its large 15 cm long canines sat on a bony cheek present on the lower jaw when the mouth was closed. It was a South American super predator that reigned during the Miocene 7 million years ago until the saber-toothed cats arrived from the northern hemisphere, causing the extinction of these, incredible marsupials 2 million years ago.\n\n The first stretching goal was unlocked.\nENTELODON (Entelodon sp.) - They are known as: \"hell pigs\" were a group of extinct mammals related to modern artiodactyls (pigs, deer, sheep, etc.). They were the size of a large bull. They had formidable teeth with which they could hunt. They stayed marks from their teeth on the skulls of large Oligocene herbivores thirty million years ago. They dominated the plains of the northern hemisphere until their extinction 5 million years ago.\n The second stretching goal was unlocked.\nINDRICOTHERIUM (Paraceratherium orgosense) It was the largest terrestrial mammal that ever existed. It reached 8 meters in height and weighed 15 tons. It was a relative of the Rhinos although, its conformation resembled a giant giraffe. It lived in southwestern China during the Oligocene 30 million years ago. Due to the dramatic climate change caused by the formation of the Himalayas, it became extinct during Miocene 16 million years ago.\n\n Special offer:\nYou can purchase STL files of the stretch goals (a maximum of 5), increasing your contribution by 3 US$ for each STL file chosen. \nMake your contribution before the end of the campaign.\nEnsure the acquisition of your STL files of choice and also help with your support to unlocking stretch goals more. \nIf you participate in this special offer at the end of the campaign, you will get:\n- STL files of the core set. \n- Stretch Goals unlocked. \n- Additional files your choice and according to your contribution.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThey are digital files, so the risk does not exist.

Clash of Deck is a card game which has been played and tested by hundreds of players throughout its first year of existence, as a French version. The game was published in 2020 in an atypical form: cards you cut yourself from a folded sheet of cardboard. A new standalone expansion was published each month. \nToday, thanks to the feedback and support of its community of players, Clash of Deck takes off with a new edition, available in English.

We recommend the Draft format for your first plays. Each turn, the players draft cards from a common deck to build themselves an efficient deck. For the Draft format, you only need one copy of the Starter Kit. The Constructed format is destined for experts who've mastered the game's mechanisms and the synergies brought by special abilities. Players build their own decks by choosing 10 cards among all the cards from the game. Their opponent will banish two of those cards at the beginning of the game, to form the final 8-cards deck. For the Constructed format, each player must have a copy of the Starter Kit.\nEach player receives a \u201cWatchtower/Stronghold\u201d card. \nPlace the 2 \u201cBridge\u201d cards in the play area. \nShuffle all the other cards into a draw pile. \nThen, reveal the top 4 cards of the draw pile. First, player A chooses 1 of the 4 available cards. Then, player B chooses 2 of the 3 remaining cards. Finally, player A takes the last remaining card. Repeat the operation, but this time, player B chooses the first card. Repeat until each player has 8 cards. Each player shuffles their cards, constituting their hand. They then place their \u201cWatchtower\u201d card in the leftmost place in their hand.\nThe player who crossed a bridge last becomes the first player. For their first turn, they begin the game with only 6 Mana.\nPlayers play their turn one after another. A turn consists of 3 phases:\nPhase 1 \u2013 Mana Regeneration:\nThe player gains as much Mana as the number of cards in their hand (including the \u201cWatchtower/Stronghold\u201d card). Mana is used to pay cards costs. The player can use it during phase 2.\nPhase 2 \u2013 Summoning:\nThe player can spend the Mana gained during phase 1 to play cards from their hand. A player can only play the 4 leftmost cards in their hand (ignoring the \u201cWatchtower / Stronghold\u201d card). \nA card\u2019s Mana cost is indicated in their upper left corner. Mana that isn\u2019t spent during a turn is lost. A player cannot spend more Mana than they gained during their previous phase 1. The play area consists of two lanes. When playing a card, the player chooses in which lane to place it. \nPlayers only summon units in their respective Realm: player A places their card on the left of the \u201cBridge\u201d cards and player B places their cards on the right of the \u201cBridge\u201d cards. There is no limit to the number of cards in a lane. A summoned unit is placed from the player\u2019s hand in the play area, face up, in the lane of their choice, behind their other units already in play. The card remains in play as long as it isn\u2019t destroyed.\nPhase 3 \u2013 Assault:\nA unit has Health Points (HP), and an Attack Value (ATK). A unit cannot attack the turn it enters play. Each unit a player controls inflicts their ATK value to an opposing unit. Units automatically activate in a predetermined order: first the upper lane, from the unit further away from to the unit closest to the \u201cBridge\u201d; then, the lower lane, from the unit further away from to the unit closest to the \u201cBridge\u201d. \nWhen a unit suffers at least as much damage as its HP value, the unit is destroyed. It suffers the entirety of the damage caused by the attack and the card returns to its owner\u2019s hand, in the rightmost place.\nThen, move all the units on the lane closer to the \u201cBridge\u201d so they fill the gap. Units regenerate their HP at the end of the turn. During an assault, a unit inflicts its ATK value to the closest opposing unit on the same lane. If no opposing unit can be attacked, the unit then inflicts its damage directly to the opponent\u2019s \u201cWatchtower/Stronghold\u201d.\nWhen a \u201cWatchtower/Stronghold\u201d suffers damage, shift it that many places to the right in the player\u2019s hand. \nWhen a \u201cWatchtower\u201d reaches the rightmost place in a player hand, it is destroyed: flip it to its \u201cStronghold\u201d side and return it to the leftmost place in the player\u2019s hand. Excess damage inflicted to the \u201cWatchtower\u201d does not carry over to the \u201cStronghold\u201d. When a \u201cStronghold\u201d card reaches the rightmost place in a player\u2019s hand, that player loses the game.\nEnd of the game\nThe game ends as soon as a \u201cStronghold\u201d card reaches the rightmost place in a player\u2019s hand. Their opponent then wins the game.\nThe Solo Mode allows you to play Clash of Deck alone, through a Quick play or a Custom play.  Before playing custom games, we recommend you practice with a few Quick games to learn and discover the rules and the peculiarities of Clash of Deck\u2019s solo mode. Fine-tune the AI difficulty level and try to reach level 5!  \nThe games will be sent from France in an envelope with an inside bubble wrap sheet for extra protection.

In another crazy project!\n\nYes, this time the project is really peculiar!\nIn our family we have 4 nieces and of course they are super in love with princesses, and various fairy tales, that they make us read or see on repeat!\n\nAt a certain point we asked ourselves what would happen if the princesses weren't so sweet and cute anymore, but they would get angry and go crazy?\n\nAnd here is the result!\n\nIn addotion we discovered that the classic fairy tales, the original ones, are anything but cheerful, they are dark and disturbing!\nAnother good reason for our girls to go crazy!\n\nBy now 3D miniatures are an established reality.\nWhen in 2017 we launched the first kickstarter with this formula many called us heretics, avant-gardists and dreamers.\n\nToday, just 4 years later, it is a widespread market and a reality that is increasingly entering people's homes.\n\nAnd we are proud to have been the forerunners of this new technology and therefore also on this occasion we offer our sculptures in stl version ready for your 3D printer!\n\nPLEASE NOTE - This Kickstarter is for digital files (STLs) to make all these items on your own home 3D printer - these are not physical goods **\n\nAll models have been presupported (where necessary)\nSeveral printing tests have been carried out to get the Best result possible, and we hope that you will also get an optimal result with your printers.\n\ncross lances is committed, as always, to solving any problem you may encounter in printing, fixing the files and creating together with you an ever-improving product.\nAlso this project has many sculptures and many varieties: we thought to satisfy as many people as possible: from collectors who love to print their miniature in resin and paint it, from fantasy football players who in recent years have often supported us, and also to those who are dedicated to filament printing and love scenery and decorative elements.\n\nSo let's go to present all our sculptures!\n\nThe first set is about Alice's fantastic adventure in Wonderland!\n\nWe decided to accompany it with three classic characters: cheshire cat , queen of hearts and mad hatter.\n\n\nHere we introduce a new famous fairy tale: Beauty and the Beast.\nIt seems that its origin is inspired by an event that really happened in Italy, in Viterbo in 1550.\nBut then various versions have followed in history.\n\n\nSleeping Beauty is another classic fairy tale that has been passed down through time and come down to us.\nWe have documented a bit on the history of this fairy tale, and the first versions are anything but cheerful, indeed they are very disturbing and not suitable for children, if you are curious I recommend you to document and you will be amazed, and perhaps horrified\n\n\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood\n\nIt's not a princess, no that's true, but it's perhaps the most famous fairy tale of all!\n\nThis story also underwent several changes in the story going to cut very bad scenes and inserting a happy ending.\nIn the past the stories didn't end very well I would say....\nFrom what we have been able to learn, this is the oldest fable that we are going to discuss.\nIt seems in fact that the origins date back even to the Egyptians, and over three hundred versions have been made in history.\nTraveling around the world has collected variants from China, Persia, Russia, England and who knows how many others up to the present day.\n\nAnother traditional fairy tale.\nThis time the origins are Danish and we can say that it has more recent origins, in fact it was published for the first time in 1837.\nBut even here the story is a little different from what we remember, and the ending is rather sad.\n\nThis story has also undergone numerous variations over time and has traveled throughout Europe, there are many ways in which the prince becomes human again.\n\nThe most famous is surely, as often happens, the one created by the Grimm brothers.\n\n\nRapunzel is another classic in the history of fairy tales.\nThe myth of the maiden locked in the tower has its origins in ancient Greece with the mythological figure of Danae.\nBut it seems that the true origins of the story come from Italy from a racocnto of 1634.\nAlso here multiple versions and variations, some more alelgre, others decidedly less happy.\n\nAnd here's the prince!\nYes, because in every good fairy tale there is a prince!\nBut we wanted to interpret him in a nice way:\nGoing to know more about the classic fairy tales and how they have evolved in history we discovered that these princes were often not so beautiful, good and kind.\nSo we imagined that the princesses got in the way of the prince in revenge for his misdeeds, and he was put to \"work\".\n\nHoping this is nice and doesn't offend anyone!\n\n\nWe decided to dedicate a small area also to lovers of scenic and filament printing.\n\nWe created this castle, partly modular, in fact you can freely assemble the pieces in order to create the composition you prefer.\n\nThe castle is in fact composed of 16 elements!\n\ninspired by the most famous fairy-tale castles in northern Europe.\n\n\n\nWe said we would make a small dedication to our Fantasy Football supporters as well and here it is!\n\nSculpting the seven dwarves from Snow White we realized that a team of dwarves with this design would be beautiful!\n\nDuring our kickstarters we are used to unlock many add-ons.\nWe generally ask our backers what they would like to see within the campaign and try to make it happen.\nUsually we get a lot of suggestions and not all of them can be realized, but we will try our best this time!\n\nIn addition we have already preset some small goals that will be unlocked as the campaign progresses!\n\n\nfirst add-on unlocked!\n\nPumpkin carriage.\nMaybe it would have been better on halloween but we liked carving it anyway.\n\nInside we left it open for those who wish to turn it into a lamp.\n\nThis time it's Sissi's turn, when we talk about princesses, we can't help but think of her, even if she doesn't belong to a traditional fairy tale but is a historical character who really existed.\n\nHere is our interpretation of Princess Sissi!\n\nAnother add-on unlocked!\n100 backers.\nAwesome!\n\nHere is the dice throwing tower!\n\nThanks again, this add-on has also been unlocked.\n\nthis time it's up to another character from the famous novel \"alice in wonderland\".\n\nHere is the white rabbit!\n\nWe went to sculpt another of the most famous princesses: the princess on a pea!\n\nWe have made another of the most famous fairy tales in the world: the three little pigs!\n\nOkay, they're not exactly princely, but we think they might like it! \nAlso this time we have moved away from the world of princesses, but it is a fairy tale that is very close to our heart, from the tales of Collodi here is Pinocchio and the Turquoise Fairy!\n\nWe promised more surprises for fantasy football lovers and here it is!\n\nA whole new team made of many little pinocchios.\nWe really liked the pinocchio sculpture so much that we decided to make a whole team.\nWith the addition of a fire-eater!\nWe hope you like it too!\nWhat would a fairy tale be without a dragon?\nAnd finally here it is for you, all our princesses (but not only) without weapons.\nDuring the campaign at the same time we will release three more miniatures related to the project.\nYou can find them on our patreon and make them yours with only 1 euro!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/crosslances\nSo don't miss this funny scene of Hansel and Gretel cooking the witch!\nThe roles are reversed!\nThese miniatures are not available on the kickstarter!\nWe would also like to point out our \"Print and Paint\"

This fourth Cotta's almanac playing cards deck was originally published in 1809. There is no known evidence of any deck issued in 1808, and so this red almanac issued in 1809 is considered to be the fourth in a series.\nCourt card figures depict Arabs in various costumes, which could have been taken from sources of the seven climes (Persia, China/Turkestan, Khw\u00e2razm, Slavonia, North Africa, Byzantium, and India), which as well adds another historical value to its rarity. \nAdditionally to the series of Cotta's almanac decks, all influenced by notable authors, this one might also draw on aspects from another Schiller's work - especially the translation and his intriguing epic symbolic adaptation of Turandot, the famous commedia dell'arte (Italian comedy) play by Count Carlo Gozzi from 1762 after and originated in supposedly Persian story of Calaf's adventure in the theme of the Arabic and Persian tales from the collection (Thousand and One Day) Les Mille et un jours (1710\u20131712) by Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9tis de la Croix.   \nThe artwork also may have been inspired by the Arab population that migrated to Germany or even studied in T\u00fcbingen where the Cotta's publishing house was founded. But mostly there was a friendship between Schiller, Goethe, Cotta, and Gozzi, who died in 1806, a year after Schiller in 1805, what might have been the true impulse.\n\"Numbered\" Limited Edition Displayed (Whole Metallic Gold-Inked Tuck)\nFeatures:\nPrinted by USPCC on Classic Stock\nPoker Size\nEmbossed (Linen) Finish \n52 Cards + 2 Extra 17th-century Jokers + 2 Extra Collectible 16th-century Art Cards \nMetallic Ink On Box & Card Backs (Both Versions of Tucks and Card Backs inside) \nCustom Seals - Numbered and Standard \nPuzzle Image on all Tuck Spines of the Series (Inking Vary by Tuck Version) \nDigitally Hand-Recreated and Designed by Azured Ox\nProduced By Will Roya\nAfter the success of the first blue 1805, the second green 1806, and the third yellow 1807 Cotta's almanac decks, again we come with two versions of the fourth red 1809 Cotta's deck limited edition - the \"Numbered\" and the \"Standard\".\nAs campaigns before, we are limiting this 4th \"Numbered\" deck to only 1,000 copies of tuck which is the whole gold-inked with custom numbered seals. Additional \"Standard\" limited edition decks are created just with a slight difference on tuck designed with dark and gold ink combination and the same custom seals (non-numbered). Both versions will include the same gold metallic inked card back design inside of the tuck box.\nThere are many historical values in the series of decks...\nThat's why the entire 6 deck series is in many ways designed by Azured Ox to meet collector's demand as a \"collection of historical books\" with their mysteries and secrets hidden inside up to your findings...\nSeries of decks will be produced with the piece of puzzle image on each tuck \"book\" spine (left side of the box) to create together a nice display of the Tuebingen monument surroundings, where the idea for Cotta's decks was born.\nPuzzle Spine Image \"Digital Demonstration\" to present Ink Combinations of Both Tuck Versions\nIf you are interested in more information about historical details with a profound and beautiful story behind Cotta's Almanac playing cards creation and idea, or about the famous and noble people connected to these unique transformation playing card decks, you can find reading after scrolling down this project page.\nThe design of both versions of Cotta's limited edition tuck boxes, the standard and the numbered, created by Azured Ox, have been inspired by the old books and published writers' work using the gold ink on their covers as well as combined with the dark ink. \nInking and Tuck Design Inspired by Old Books\nUnexplained stories, hidden mysteries, secrets...\nMuch of historical happenings, influences, and activities would find a place in the Cotta decks, including events in the life of Cotta's own family and notable figures like Schiller and Goethe. Other important influences include the literature, art, history, politics (e.g. Napoleon's invasion), and religious reforms of the time, which all served as an important context to shape the art in the decks themselves...\n4th almanac deck: \"Arabic Turandot\" (Year 1809) \nAfter the first blue deck themed on Joan of Arc play by Schiller, the second green deck themed on Jean Racine's plays, which were translated into the German language by Schiller, and the third yellow deck themed on Wallenstein, here in the fourth red deck, again the images on the court cards might be the characters somehow connected to another Schiller's translational work (1801), the Turandot by Count Carlo Gozzi from 1762, and so those Arabs displayed on court cards might be deeply inspired by Schiller's reverse thinking about the Turandot tale's true origin, as up to the present day, this play in its variety of settlements is considered as an enigma since original ideas were mostly filtered through many versions and their translated adaptations around the world over time.\n\"Nizami Ganjavi\" Jamal ad-D\u012bn Ab\u016b Mu\u1e25ammad Ily\u0101s ibn-Y\u016bsuf ibn-Zakk\u012b is considered the greatest romantic epic poet in Persian literature, who brought a colloquial and realistic style to the epic.\nCourt card figures depict Arabs in various costumes, which could have been taken from sources of the seven climes (Persia, China/Turkestan, Khw\u00e2razm, Slavonia, North Africa, Byzantium, and India), which adds another historical value to its rarity. These seven climes may stretch back into the old stories, which are eventually also linked as a source idea for Turandot anecdote - Persian masterpiece Seven Beauties, by the Persian \"wisdom\" poet Nezami (died 1209) who recounts the romantic history of the pre-Islamic Persian king Bahram. The story of his journey from \"black to white\" also refers to Bahram\u2019s spiritual development from darkness and ignorance to light and illumination, uniting himself with the source of light. He grows to a Perfect Man and an ideal king.\nThe plot of this story is very complex but significantly filled with mathematical, astronomical, cosmogonic, medical, spiritual, and mystical symbolism, which is surely interesting background for playing cards and their purposely hidden deep meanings...\nAnd why Arabs? Turandot = Turan's daughter \n(The name derives from the Persian compound name Turan and dokht, meaning the daughter of Turan. Dokht is a shortened form of dokhtar or \"daughter\", \"girl\". As Persian belongs to the Indo-European family of languages, the word dokhtar has cognates in European languages. Turan refers to the northeastern borders of Persia. Turandot recounts the story of a Turkestan/Chinese princess who kills her suitors when they fail to decipher riddles.)\nAdditionally to the series of Cotta's almanac decks, all influenced by notable authors and works, it is more than likely, just by continuing pattern, that even this 4th red deck might also draw on aspects from another Schiller's work - especially as mentioned above, the Schiller's translation and his intriguing epic symbolic adaptation of Turandot, the famous commedia dell'arte (Italian comedy) play by Count Carlo Gozzi from 1762 after and originated in supposedly Persian story of Calaf's adventure in the theme of the Arabic and Persian tales from the collection (Thousand and One Day) Les Mille et un jours (1710\u20131712) translated from Persian original by Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9tis de la Croix.\nCount Carlo Gozzi (13 December 1720 \u2013 4 April 1806)\nThere is also evidence of the first theatre premiere of Schiller's adaptation of Turandot in 1802, specifically at the \"old\" Weimar Hoftheater by Johann von Goethe, who had been the theatre's director since its inception in 1791. Schiller had begun a collaborative friendship with Goethe in 1794 which lasted until Schiller's death in 1805, after which Goethe forsook ballads and turned to the completion of Part one of Faust, as well as the Cotta's almanac deck series, started in 1805, marked and influenced by these significant occurrences, and then even Gozzi's death came about a year after in 1806, and this deck's theme might be the tribute to Gozzi.\n(If you are interested in more info about Schiller, Goethe, and Cotta's relation to this series of Cotta's decks, you might scroll down to read in the part of \"Story About\".)\n\"R\u00e9ba Roi Arabe\" (Lettered on King of Spades Court Card)\nIt's not all just about Schiller's famous works...\nAs the first blue and the second green and the third yellow deck before, also this fourth red deck was threaded by majestic and noble roots... Besides the noble publisher of the deck, Johann Friedrich Cotta, again there was another person involved in the graphical part of this deck creation.\nJohann Friedrich Cotta (April 27, 1764 - December 29, 1832)\nFor the fourth time, again, cards were designed and stipple engraved by Countess Mary Day von Jennison-Walworth (sometimes spelled with a single 'n'). Her maiden name was Beauclerk, and she was the wife of Count Francis Jenison Walworth (1764\u20131824).\nProbably, she was creating illustrations for decks in Stuttgart as detected from letter communication addressed to her mother in Britain that contained writings about the Cotta's decks... Her mother was Lady Diana Beauclerk (n\u00e9e Lady Diana Spencer; other married names Diana St John, Viscountess Bolingbroke; 24 March 1734 \u2013 1 August 1808). Also, there in those letters is a mention about her mother's health failing what later resulted in a fatality, which probably might have been the main reason for the missing Cotta's almanac deck right for the year 1808 of the series. \nSix Unique Different Card Back Patterns Designed, with Regard to Card Handling, Individually for Each of the Cotta's Deck Year Almanacs.\nClassic Style Borderless Full-Bleed Card Back Design with Luxury Feeling and Metallic Ink\nThe Same Gold Metallic Ink Card Back Design for Both Editions of the Cotta's Deck\nAces\nSpades\nDiamonds\nClubs\nHearts\nIn contrast to previous Cotta's decks' issues where the court cards were designated with the words \"Valet\", \"Dame\", and \"Roi\", which are the French terms corresponding to the Jack, Queen, and King, here the court cards of this 4th issue, Jack and Queen are not described, only King is described as \"Roi\".\nAmong all courts, the only single named figure of King R\u00e9ba, the Midianite King of East, is represented as the King of Spades.\nJack of Spades - African\nQueen of Spades - Noblewoman \nKing of Spades - King Reba*\n*Reba was one of five Midianite kings (E\u02b9vi, Re\u02b9kem, Zur, Hur, and Re\u02b9ba) killed during the time of Moses by an Israelite expedition led by Phinehas, who was the grandson of Aaron (the elder brother of Moses) and the son of priest Eleazar (nephew of Moses), according to Numbers 31:8 and Joshua 13:21.\nJack of Hearts - Merchant \nQueen of Hearts - Noblewoman in ordinary home dress \nKing of Hearts - Regalia Nobleman\nJack of Clubs - Ordinary man \nQueen of Clubs - Countrywoman \nKing of Clubs - African\nJack of Diamonds - Infantryman \nQueen of Diamonds - Maiden in summer dress \nKing of Diamonds - Nobleman\nAt last, we came with an idea to reflect the opposite of noble life and to bring closer to you even more of the unique artistic history placed on extra collectible playing cards...\nAlso, we thought it could be interesting to put other illustrations from the far past on the additional extra cards, in respect to year almanacs, we came with an idea of twelve calendar months in the series as an exclusive collection of unique historical artworks...\nWith the Elements of Heraldic Achievement...\nIncludes heraldry symbols connected with the family and past of the noble designer countess Jenison von Walworth who created most of the Cotta's decks...\nAn absolutely original playing card masterpiece to hang on your wall (double-sided)\nEARLY BIRD:\n\"RED\" #4 Cotta's Almanac Deck Rewards: \nCOMBINATION of previous STANDARD Cotta's Decks with actual \"RED\" #4 STANDARD Deck: \nDid you miss some of the previous decks? \nYou can add some decks to your original tier pledges with no extra shipping costs. \nStandard version of the decks are $10 each and limited version are $12 each.\nPlease note Limited #1 is not available at this time.\nYou will also have the option to add-on after the campaign and add additional items such as uncuts and other items based on availability.\nClick on manage your pledge and add bonus support for the desired amount; for example, if you would like to add 1 limited and 1 standard version of a deck you would add $22 to additional support.

You will also have the option to add-on after the campaign.\nMarch 19th, 2021 - April 4th, 2021\nSince this 4th deck's theme might be mostly inspired by the work of Count Carlo Gozzi, Schiller's translational work on Gozzi's Turandot, and even their friendship behind, this 4th deck might have been issued as a tribute to Gozzi, who died on April 4th, 1806, a year after Schiller, so we set symbolically end date of this 4th Cotta's deck project just to this memorial event...\nCharming beginning of \"Karten Almanach\" series\nThe story behind these playing cards, which probably conceal most of the world's playing card secrets, begins in T\u00fcbingen, a city in southwest Germany.\nThe idea behind the concept of Cotta's transformation decks was to create a series of six decks on an annual basis from 1805-1811. Each deck would focus on a different theme...\nForming a \"Card Almanac\" (Karten Almanach), each card in the deck would represent one of the 52 weeks in a calendar year. At the time it was popular to print various almanacs, which were special pocketbooks for the new year, and often included a short poem or quote for each week of the calendar year. It was a logical move to connect each of these 52 weeks with playing cards.\nOriginal illustrations were fiddling artworks - manually stipple engraved & etched on copper plates\n The famous Cotta's publishing house... \nThe friendship that gave birth to the idea of Cotta's transformation playing card almanac decks...\nThe color of each tuck box created by Azured Ox has been inspired by Goethe's experimental optic and color theory, since Goethe was an important contemporary of Cotta, along with Schiller. (Goethe's deepest immersion into colors was during Cotta's decks issuing.)\nMax Playing Cards\nWorshipful Company of Makers of Playing Cards\nWorld of Playing Cards\nUnited Cardists\nThe Magic Cafe\nKardify\nMagic Orthodoxy\nGentleman Wake\nEnder's Game Reviewer\nThe Card Club\nPlaying Card Collector's Club\nRepeat Super Backers\nFellow Creators & Social Media Friends\nMy Family & Staff\nFulfillment\nBy PlayingCardDecks.com with a safe delivery guarantee and emailed tracking.

Many Patreons and Kickstarters have crazy good looking sculpts of various huge bosses, or overly fragile dynamically posed monsters - but nobody is designing minis for the working DM, who wants to throw a set of monsters on the printer before work, come home and they are sitting there finished (with no print errors), slap some paint on them quick, and use them in tonight's session.\nThis Kickstarter is designed for every DM - regardless of what kind of fantasy game you run, what kind of printer you have, or what kind of models you are looking to fill out your ranks with, this campaign will have something for you. We have sets of all your basic monsters (orcs, goblins, gnolls, kobolds, undead, etc) plus MANY stretch goals planned out, with a backer voting to help add even more stuff to the pledge.\n\nThese minis are designed for your standard fantasy game, and are scaled ~32mm with somewhat heroic proportions. They'll look great next to your existing 3D printable figs, HeroForge, Reaper Bones, etc.\nMinis are designed to print with zero slicer supports - just drop it on your build plate and print away.  Each mini is provided unbased, based on a simple flat base (for you to decorate to your own liking), and also based on a \"quick release\" bevelled and channeled base (for resin printing, which makes removal from the build plate easy).\nIn addition to carefully modeling designs to be support free, we have another advantage: I am a software engineer by trade, and developed an algorithm to help check and remove overhangs in the modeling/repair process, which leads to even easier to print minis!\nThis campaign is easy to understand. There is one pledge level, and it gets you everything pictured on this page! All the minis below are included with your pledge. These minis will be delivered to you as  STL files, with all the base options noted above. I've also release a ton of BASES , and am working on another free base pack for this campaign you can use to base these minis if you want more decorative bases.\nAs new stretch goals are unlocked, I'll add them to the list of included minis below.  There's 31 minis in the core pack, and I'm expecting to have nearly 100 minis in this campaign when all is said and done!\n\n** PLEASE NOTE - This Kickstarter is for digital files (STLs) to make all these items on your own home 3D printer - these are not physical goods **\nTo see a high-res gallery of zoomable renders of each model shown, CLICK HERE\n \\\nHOW IT WORKS\nEvery $1k we hit in funding, I'll choose, at random, a current backer. That backer will pick a set in the list above, then I'll roll a d4 and whichever tier I roll will be unlocked! If I roll a tier already unlocked for a set, I'll re-roll. \"Backer vote\" means we'll do a 48 hr vote to unlock a mini, \"Backer Pick\" means that backer will choose a mini to add to the campaign (based on my discretion of course). Some minis above are single minis, other are sets of minis.\n\nUNLOCK HISTORY\n $15k : Tyler Sawher picked Set #12, 1d4 roll = 4,  Backer Vote - unlocked  the MAD KING\n $16k : Thomas Milazzo picked Set #6, 1d4 roll = 2 , VAMPIRES unlocked\n $17k : Bryan Larson picked Set #11, 1d4 roll = 1 , UNICORN unlocked\n BONUS: 1d12+1 roll = Set 4, 1d4 roll = 3,  HOBGOBLINS unlocked\n $18k: David Schilt picked Set #7, 1d4 roll = 4, Backer Pick - David chose BLIGHTS\n $19k: Christopher Darren Arnold picked Set #9, 1d4 roll = 1, SUCCUBUS unlocked\n $20k: Alec Lanter picked Set #12, 1d4 roll = 2, BONY DEVIL unlocked\n $21k: Harry Colquhoun picked Set #3, 1d4 roll = 2, GIANT SPIDERS unlocked\n BONUS: 1d12+1 roll = Set 4, 1d4 roll = 1,  FLAME SKULLS unlocked\n $22k: Josh Harrison picked Set #10, 1d4 roll = 3, GOLEMS unlocked\n $23k: Earl McCammon picked Set #9, 1d4 roll = 2, IMPS unlocked\n $24k: Matthew Smithers picked Set #8, 1d4 roll = 2, AZER unlocked\n $25k: Silas Mortensen picked Set #11, 1d4 roll = 2, NIGHTMARE unlocked\n $26k: Quentin Christensen picked Set #7, 1d4 roll = 1, WOLF PACK unlocked\n $27k: Justin Wold picked Set #6 1d4 roll = 3, DEATH KNIGHT unlocked\n $28k: Jesse Bailed picked Set #3, 1d4 roll = 1, GIANT TOAD unlocked\n BONUS: 1d12+1 roll = Set #2, 1d4 roll = 2, MINOTAUR unlocked\n $29k: Nick Cook picked Set #5, 1d4 roll = 3, TROLLS unlocked.\n $30k: Adam Albert picked Set #8, 1d4 roll = 4, Backer Vote - unlocked SLAADS\n $31k: Timothy Woods picked Set #1, 1d4 roll = 3, LICH unlocked.\n $32k: EAA00 picked set #7, 1d4 roll = 3, BULLYWUGS unlocked.\n $33k: Charlotte Lee picked set #11, 1d4 roll = 3, YOUNG DRAGON unlocked\n $34k: John Wyss picked Set #13, 1d4 roll = 1, BOAR unlocked.\n BONUS: unlisted stretch goal, GIANT CENTIPEDE unlocked\n $35k: Wilbur Massie picked set #11, final set = 4, Wilbur chose RUST MONSTER\n $36k: Sam Bowskill picked Set #13, 1d4 roll = 3, UNDEAD CROC unlocked\n $37k: Francois Demers picked Set #10, 1d4 roll = 1, INCUBUS unlocked\n $38k: Jon Larsen picked Set #2, 1d4 roll = 3, HILL GIANTS unlocked\n $39k: Brandy Walter picked Set #12, 1d4 roll = 3, CULTISTS unlocked\n $40k: Rick picked Set #2, 1d4 roll = 2, EVIL WIZARD unlocked\n $41k: Daniel Arlos Edwards - set choice pending\n $42k: Michael Francis - set choice pending\n $43k: Tommy Kehlet - set choice pending\n $44k: Ryan Leitch - set choice pending\n $45k: Battle Wear picked Set #8, 1d4 roll = 1, ANIMATED ARMOR unlocked\n*** [NOTE - once the campaign is ended I can no longer update the renders, stretch goal graphic, or text on this page, so please refer to KS updates to see additional renders and info on pending unlocks!] ***\nEverybody loves free stuff, right?! EC3D has many many awesome minis over the years, and we remastered some from past campaigns to include as bonus items for this campaign - all backers will also receive the minis listed below, and I might add more during the campaign:\nMy name is Evan Carothers, and I am a 3D designer with hundreds of designs released via Thingiverse (ecaroth) and through my premium design company (EC3D). This is my 9th Kickstarter, and any of my thousands of customers can tell you about my track record of easy-to-print models - delivered on time. My skill and love for design has grown out of my passion for tabletop gaming, technology, and 3D printing. I design a  ton of the content myself and work with many other great designers and artists to put these projects together. Take a look at the quality of my free items on Thingiverse or my last campaigns Wilds of Wintertide,  Depths of Savage Atoll or Empire of Scorching Sands to get a feel for my design aesthetic, or check out some customer reviews. I am a tabletop gamer at heart, and all models are  printed, and often painted, by myself before being released.\n\nParticipating Modelers, Artists, Painters, and Printers\nCredit to these awesome folks who helped this all come together!\nJoshua Black (lead 3D character design),  Ulises Virgen (3D character design),  Sebastiano Di Grazia (3D character design), Ryan Calhoun (Cephalopod Studios, painting), Ruslan Ahmatnurov (concept art), and Jean Roux (art)\nAnd a SPECIAL thank you to my wonderful wife Ally who has been unbelievably helpful, and essential in preparing this campaign!\n\nAdd-Ons\n\nAdd-ons allow you to get additional awesome stuff at a great discount, and help push even further to unlock stretch goals! There's tons of sets (including fantasy, sci-fi, and space-combat scale) with hundreds more miniatures and lots of terrain/scenery.\nTo get add-ons, just increase your pledge level by the amount indicated for whichever add-ons you would like. Once the KS closes I will be using a pledge manager (BackerKit) to help you finalize you add-ons. You can increase you pledge on KS now to help fund stretch goals, or get these after the campaign closes.\nTo add any STL stretch goals you must back the campaign at a level that includes STLs.\n\n Empire of Scorching Sands: My last sprawling campaign, featuring Arabian/Persian/Egyptian/desert terrain/scatter, monsters, and minis - Empire of Scorching Sands - the add-ons are equivalent to the what's included in that campaign (including stretch goals): Terrain/scatter only ($20 add-on), Minis only ($20 add-on), or ALL IN ($30 add-on).\n Wilds of Wintertide: A chilly, northern project featuring icy, arctic tundra, terrain/scatter, monsters, and minis - Wilds of Wintertide - the add-ons are equivalent to the what's included in that campaign (including stretch goals): Terrain/scatter only ($18 add-on), Minis only ($18 add-on), or ALL IN ($25 add-on).\n A Den of Alien Evil - Everything from the first volume of my \"Community (Treasure)Chest\" series - Mind Horror scenery, terrain, and minis.

Check it out the content from the original campaign HERE ($15 add-on).\n Depths of Savage Atoll: A sprawling campaign, featuring nautical, jungle, pirate, and undersea minis and environs - Depths of Save Atoll - the add-ons are equivalent to the what's included in that campaign (including stretch goals): Terrain/scatter only ($35 add-on), Minis only ($35 add-on), or ALL IN ($65 add-on).\n Skyless Realms: The races and places below the surface, from my previous campaign Skyless Realms  - the add-ons are equivalent to what's included in that campaign (including stretch goals): Terrain only ($40 add-on), Minis only ($35 add-on), or ALL IN ($55 add-on).\n Novus Landing - My most recent 3D printable Kickstarter, full of scifi goodness! The add-ons are is equivalent to what's included in all-in pledge level of Novus Landing, (including unlocked stretch goals): Minis, Terrain/Scatter, or Vehicles (1 set for $25) or ALL IN (all 3 sets for $50)\n The Terra Conflict - My most recent 3D printable Kickstarter, full of space-combat scale ships, creatures, terrain, and more for epic space battles and encounters. This add-on is equivalent to what's included in the '3D Printable STL Files' pledge level of The Terra Conflict, including unlocked stretch goals ($30 add-on for the base set, and $42 for the base set + both add-on fleets).\n The Ignis Quadrant: My first foray into scifi, featuring support-free minis, tons of vehicles and lots of scatter terrain for all your scifi RPG and wargaming needs!

Anybody can signup for that license, and sell the models from this campaign under that license, and I will not be doing specific merchant tiers for this campaign. So to sell these files (and other non-exclusive EC3D sets) you just need to signup for that resale program and back this campaign to receive the files.\n\nAccountability\nEverybody hates waiting, and many people have been burned by poorly designed files and broken delivery timelines in previous kickstarters from other vendors. This is not the case with my campaigns. All core models, and many stretch goals, area already finalized and test printed - and the majority of files will be ready for delivery the second the funds clear after the Kickstarter finishes (usually 2 weeks after the date the campaign ends). I will be finalizing and releasing the remaining items as fast as humanly possible, with a goal of 90 days *MAX* after this Kickstarter ends for delivery - which is something I have successfully done for all my previous Kickstarters. \n\nDisclaimer & Printing Requirements\nTo get the most out of the printable parts from this Kickstarter, you will need to have a well-tuned 3D printer. All minis are designed for FDM or resin printing, and will fit on the print beds of 99% of commercially-available at-home printers.\nEvery part is test printed by myself and repaired to be manifold and ready to drop on your slicer - however, In the event that any issues with the files get past my own QA testing and process, and my other test printers, I will make every effort to fix the file and remedy the situation as soon as possible. I use Dropbox for file delivery so I can push updates/fixes. My number one goal is to make some awesome, unique designs you can have a ton of fun with on your tabletop!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are very few, if any, risks and challenges for this campaign.

Introducing: Fates End 2: Terra & Cosmos! 3D printable Dice Towers + MORE for tabletop gaming!   \nWhat you get for Loot-All+ Pledges:    \n The 15 core STL files will be released by August 2021 with all stretch goals being delivered afterwards. All files will be split for smaller printers and are support-free for easy 3D printing! Please Check the PRODUCTION SCHEDULE for release dates! \n_______________________________________________________________\nUpcoming Stretch Goals\n *Any unlocked Stretch Goals will be included the my NEXT campaign! \n\nThe Special Social Media Stretch Goal has been UNLOCKED! Say hello to The Heaven & Hell Dice Tower!     \n_______________________________________________________________\nAdd-Ons:\nPlease see Update #11 for details on how to add Add-ons to your pledge. If you're a new backer, you'll find the option to add Add-ons after you select your pledge level!\n\nHoliday Ornaments! These are really simple but they were a lot of fun to give away to my friends and neighbors last season! I printed mine in resin, about 2\" tall and spray painted them with gold or silver spray paint! It's hard to get a photo that does them justice!\nBANKS! I gave a way a few bonus banks in the previous campaign (just for fun) but I didn't have the time to get them as perfect as I wanted. Adding this as an Add-on will allow me to use part of my production schedule to develop an improved plug! Here's an example of the Tiamat Bank:\nPLAY\n\n_______________________________________________________________\nFatesEnd has partnered with Mythos Games for a very special Stretch Goal Bonus! For every $10k raised in this campaign, we will donate one table top game to our local Children's Hospital! Thanks Mythos Games!  \n_______________________________________________________________\nDo you want to print test a file first? \nThat's cool, we get that, so we're giving away one Dice Tower for free. Click below to get a FREE Mayan Temple Dice Tower .STL file to print today!    \n_______________________________________________________________\n--------------> ALL files are Print Tested and Repaired before release! <---------------\n_______________________________________________________________\nConcept art of all Core Set items:\n5 Sci-Fi-Inspired Dice Towers\n5 Earth-Inspired Dice Towers\n4 Dice Jails/vaults\n& 1 GM Screen     \n_______________________________________________________________\nMore Details\nWhy Dice Towers? Dice towers help to prevent cheating - and allow Fate do her job! Dice Towers also add an extra level of character to your game! Each tower will include a dice tray to help protect fancy pants tables from heavy metal dice damage. Lastly (our favorite) these Dice Towers inspire envy in friend and foe alike! Enjoy that clackity-clack until fate has rendered her verdict.       \nPLAY\n\n_______________________________________________________________\nWhat's a Dice Jail/Vault? Ah, good question! We didn't know either when we launched our previous campaign  but due to UNPRECEDENTED feedback (begging and pleading) from backers, we offered Dice Jails as stretch goals. Since then, the feedback (begging and pleading) has continued, so we were sure to provide LOTS of Dice Jails and Dice Vaults in this campaign. So, what are they? Dice Jails are intended to punish bad dice in style. Dice Vaults are for less naughty dice who need a place to stay for the night... or until their next adventure commences. \n_______________________________________________________________\nEASY TO PRINT! The files will be designed to be 3D Printed easily without supports! (Supports are the WORST!)   \nActual FDM print (60% at .15 mm layer height)\n_______________________________________________________________ \nDo you actually print your files? Yep, I do, then I print it again, and sometimes... again. \nPLAY\n\n_______________________________________________________________\nAll files will be designed to print on smaller FDM Printers like the Prusa Mini. Files above 7\" (about 177mm) tall will be split into two models so they\u2019re printable on smaller printers. \n_______________________________________________________________\nCan I print it even smaller? These objects can be any size that your printer can support, so you can print them smaller (if you have a small printer) or larger (for large dice) if desired.  All Dice towers are designed to work with standard 20mm dice at 100% scale. (*Dice set/tower scales are determined by the size of the D20 in the set.) If you can't print the towers at 100%, then print them at 60% to work with tiny 12mm dice sets (can be found in local game stores or on Amazon.) Teeeny tiny printers such as the Photon and Mars are unlikely to print the majority of dice towers AND work with existing dice. However, Dice Jails and Vaults may work, depending on size and scale. \n (Photo of actual printed objects ^) \nActual Resin print\n_______________________________________________________________\nHave bigger dice? No problem! You can 3D print these files at any scale (*that your printer can support!). Use the dice scaler tab in the PRODUCTION SCHEDULE to determine scale. \n_______________________________________________________________\nWhat printers are supported? All files will be designed to fit within 7\" square print areas (Prusa Mini). Files will be split vertically to fit taller printers.      \nPrinted in Resin (60%)\n_______________________________________________________________\nI don't have a 3D printer, how do I get a physical product? Although we won\u2019t be selling physical prints through this campaign, we will be offering a Merchant tier that allows the sale of physical prints of all 15 core products, plus ALL unlocked stretch goals. We had a plethora of Merchants with our previous campaign, and we expect (hope) we can duplicate the same success here! \n_______________________________________________________________\nWill you be including 6 tray types for towers in this campaign? Sadly, no. Instead of offering 6 simple trays, we wanted to focus on unique designs for each tray for this campaign.  All tower files will come with one removable tray. Our hope is to include spaces to hold dice, but all trays may not have a great spot for dice. Trays will be only one size, one type. In collecting feedback from the previous campaign, we found that the majority of backers were printing the same trays (large.) If we get enough feedback, we may consider an additional tray type (OpenLock perhaps?) but at this moment, one tray is what is being offered in this campaign.\nTrays that are too large for our 7\"x7\"x7\" print minimum will be split into parts using puzzle shapes for easy assembly. \n_______________________________________________________________\nCan you teach me how to 3D Print? We have a Fates End Print Support Group on Facebook for all backers with lots of volunteers who can help you get started. Many of our backers from the previous campaign were first time printers, and were able to get up and running with the help of our volunteers. \nWe will send the Facebook Link out to all backers after the campaign funds (usually two weeks after the campaign ends.)\n_______________________________________________________________\n When will I get the files? \nEach object will take about 1 week to model, print test, repair and deliver. GM screen(s) will take two weeks. Please check the PRODUCTION SCHEDULE for Release dates.\nThose who back the FatesEnd #1 & #2 or Dual License tiers will receive their FatesEnd #1 files after this campaign funds (*usually two weeks after the campaign ends.)\n_______________________________________________________________ \n\nQuotes from backers of FatesEnd 1 (previous campaign):     \n_______________________________________________________________\nPrevious Campaign (FatesEnd 1)\nIf you're interested in adding files from the previous FatesEnd campaign (FatesEnd1), but you'd like to see them first, you can find renders, photos and details here. \nPLAY\n\n_______________________________________________________________\nImprovements\nWe'll be fulfilling orders from this campaign through Backerkit! We're hoping for a better/clearer process for file access this time around. \n\nSince this is our 2nd campaign, we learned a lot from the previous one. We believe this experience will help us communicate more effectively to help fulfillment run smoothly! \n_______________________________________________________________\n MERCHANTS \n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>IMPORTANT NOTICE<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\nNew Merchants: The Merchant license from this campaign does not apply to the previous campaign (FatesEnd1) If you want to sell FatesEnd1 assets, we offer the Dual License for new Merchants.\nMerchants from FatesEnd1: you do not need to purchase a Dual License since you already have a license to sell assets from FatesEnd1 (The first campaign). However, if you wish to sell assets from this campaign (FatesEnd2), you must back the Merchant License tier.\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\nOur Merchant program in our previous campaign was a huge success! Many Merchants sold so many towers/dice jails from the previous campaign, they were able to expand their print space into a full fledged printer farm! Some Merchants were even able to convert their printing hobby into a full time job from selling FatesEnd merch! To be clear, we can't guarantee the success of every Merchant (that's honestly up to you), but it was fun to see the success of many of our Merchants, especially those who were actively engaged on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, etc.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: No one is permitted to sell prints form this campaign (FatesEnd2) unless they back the Merchant License tier, or the Dual License Tier from this campaign. Selling/giving away files is strictly prohibited. \n______________________________________________________________\nLicense duration: The license is good for a full 24 months from the date of the last released file. The more stretch goals we unlock, the longer you can sell! \n______________________________________________________________\nMerchant ID. To protect our Merchants and their investment, every Merchant receives a unique Merchant ID. This makes it easy to spot sellers who haven't acquired a Merchant License and put a stop to their piracy (Yarrrrr! Avast ye swabs!)   \n Special note for FatesEnd1 Merchants: for those of you who back the FE2 Merchant tier (this campaign) We'll make sure your IDs have the same number as your FE1 ones.\nRestrictions: You may use FateEnd watermarked renders in your listings, however please don\u2019t use Fates End photos to promote your sales. Please use your own photos when listing for sales (you may use concept art until 1 week after finalized files are delivered.  \nWatermarked Render Example\n ______________________________________________________________\nMerchant-Only FB Support Group\nWe have a Merchant-only Facebook support group where you can all share photos of your prints, ask questions and help support one another. \nIf you want to get a Merchant License, but you're still not sure which tier to back, please check this handy for further clarification:\nDual Licenses are only for new merchants who wish to sell prints from both campaigns.  \nFatesEnd 1 Merchants already have the right to sell files from FatesEnd1. Please do not back the Dual License tier if you already have a Merchant License from the previous campaign. Please back the Merchant License tier.\n\nMerchant Licenses and Dual Licenses from campaign 2 will not be issued until campaign 2 funds (two weeks after the end of the campaign.)\n\nThe new campaign does not limit the Merchant License duration from the previous campaign (FatesEnd 1) in any way.\n\n****SPECIAL FOR ALL Fates End 1 MERCHANTS**** If we get more than 20 Dual-License ($550)backers in this campaign, we will extend ALL MERCHANT LICENCE durations from the FIRST campaign to match the end date of FatesEnd 2 licenses!

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my second campaign. The first one blasted past all of my expectations. I've learned a lot from the process, and although we had a few hiccups in the beginning, I believe, in the end, that it was a successful campaign. We have an active community of backers who support one another, and to me, that's the biggest success I could have hoped for.\n\nI feel that there is very little risk this time around. I own all the software, hardware and a lot of learnings from the previous campaign. \n\nChallenge 1: Manufacturing/modeling easy to print items\nSolution - Experience! I\u2019ve been 3D Printing since 2015 and modeling since 2013. In that time, I\u2019ve learned how to create models that don\u2019t require supports, rafts or high infill. (Honestly, complex creations that require supports are the BANE of 3D printing! Many swarings have happened in this house due to the struggles of printing items that require complex supports.) I have owned 11+ printers (no kidding!) We currently have 3 Prusa MK3\u2019s, 3 Prusa Minis, an Elegoo Saturn and a Anycubic Mono X.\n\nChallenge 2: Time\nSolution - Self-employed! I have the time planned out to create the remaining files for this campaign. I have the software, hardware, skill and experience, all I need is time. I am self-employed so I have complete control over my time! All I have to do is schedule the time in, and boom - we\u2019re on track!\nBy funding this project, you make it possible for me to focus on this project instead of client work for a time.

This Kickstarter campaign offers two dramatically different works:\n Illuminated Manuscript. A collection of web, unpublished, and older articles pulled from the company's history. Starting at 24 pages, the zine expands in size as stretch goals are unlocked and we add more articles to the collection!\n 1976 Ogre Playtest Booklet. Constructed from scans of Steve's typewritten and hand-illustrated Ogre playtest set, this saddle-stitched booklet gives you a look at Ogre in its pre-publication form. Have you always wanted to learn more about Steve's first game? This book pulls back the curtains and gives you a version of the game you've not seen before!\nRead on to learn more about both zines!\nAt project launch, Illuminated Manuscript includes a mix of web articles, the winning entry in our recent Ogre playmat scenario contest, and material from the pages of Where We're Going -- our retailer newsletter -- from 1987 and 1988.  \nDigital mockup. This article showcases the progress of GURPS Space in 1987/1988, as documented in the pages of the Where We're Going Newsletter. This hard-to-find newsletter for retailers and distributors includes info that wasn't shared with GURPS players at the time the book was being created. Final may vary slightly in appearance.\nProject stretch goals, if unlocked, add another twelve pages to the zine, expanding the total size to 36 pages. (See stretch goals, below, for more information.) These stretch goals include more web content and previously unreleased material. \n The articles at project launch include:\nDeluxe Illuminati: The Servants of Cthulhu Solitaire Challenge\nGURPS Space, The Albatross of 1987/1988*\n Halloween d6 Dice Set Rules by Steve Jackson \nEyes on the Prize, An Ogre Scenario**\n It\u2019s Munchkin Party Time! with Andrew Hackard \nDesigner\u2019s Notes: Cthulhu Dice\nThinking Outside of the Box**\n Army Men d6 Dice Set Rules \nMunchkin Dungeon Design: For Munchkins, By Munchkins\n * From Where We're Going and Roleplayer (1987/1988)\n** New to Illuminated Manuscript.\n\"This is a reproduction of an actual surviving Ogre playtest set from 1976. It consists of the rules (typed on typewriter \u2013 no word processors yet!), the map (hand-drawn by me, with the sophisticated graphics talent for which I am NOT famous), and the game counters (also hand-made by me).\" \n- Steve Jackson, from the introduction (written in 2021)\n\nDigital mockup of the 1976 Ogre Playtest Booklet. Final may vary slightly in appearance.\n\n\nWhat an incredible treat! Dated November 4, 1976, this is Steve's typewritten playtest set for the original Ogre game. We've scanned the pages and have presented them exactly as the marked copies appear. Have you wanted a look at Ogre in its pre-publication form? This is your chance to add an unusual collectible to your Ogre library!\nThe booklet comes in at 20 pages (which includes the cover, back cover, and inside covers). The center includes the map. We will release the PDF as a free title once this Kickstarter campaign has closed, so you won't have to cut your booklet if you want to build the set and play the game as it existed in 1976.\nDigital mockup of the 1976 Ogre Playtest Booklet. Final may vary slightly in appearance.\nNOTE: None of the project stretch goals impact the content of the 1976 Ogre Playtest Booklet. This saddle-stitched zine is 100% maxed out in terms of page count and ready to go at project launch. One stretch goal upgrades the physical construction of the booklet. See below.\nIf unlocked, these stretch goals directly impact the Illuminated Manuscript zine.\n $2,000 - UNLOCKED! - +4 pages added to the Illuminated Manuscript. (Ogre Sixth Edition vs Designer's Editon comparison and Cthulhu Dice spell effects for fantasy RPGs*) \n $3,500 - UNLOCKED! - +4 pages added to the Illuminated Manuscript. (Spiral Summoning for The Fantasy Trip* and Zombie Dice Designer's Notes) \n $5,000 - UNLOCKED! - +4 pages added to the Illuminated Manuscript. (Munchkins & Mazes Designer's Notes, Gelatinous Solitaire Rules, and One On One Munchkin Monster Melee*) \n* New to Illuminated Manuscript.\nIf this stretch goal is unlocked, we will add three copies of a new Munchkin bookmark to all print reward levels. (This bookmark will be released as a free promo later in 2021.)\n $7,500 - UNLOCKED! - Munchkin Bosses bookmark. What is Munchkin Bosses? A new mini-expansion scheduled for release later in 2021! NEW! \nIf this stretch goal is unlocked, we improve the physical construction of the 1976 Ogre Playtest Booklet.\n $10,000 - UNLOCKED! - The cover of the 1976 Ogre Playtest Booklet is upgraded to a heavier stock. \nIf unlocked, the next stretch goal adds another four pages to the Illuminated Manuscript zine!\n $13,000 - UNLOCKED! - +4 pages added to the Illuminated Manuscript. (Confessions of a Tree-Hugger, How it Got to be Z-Shot, and Dragons*. All by Steve Jackson! Dragons is an unpublished dice game using standard six-sided dice.) \n* New to Illuminated Manuscript.\nIf the next stretch goal is unlocked, all reward levels receive one copy each of the two coaster designs. These are the same size/style as the coasters currently available at Warehouse 23. \n $15,000 - UNLOCKED! - Two different coasters, one Ogre and one The Fantasy Trip, added to each reward level.\nAll stretch goals unlocked!\nDigital mockup.

If those limits are met, we will review the situation and open up more slots when possible.\n\n\n NOTE: Street addresses only.\nAfter the Kickstarter project closes, and after all pledges are collected, we will open the BackerKit pledge manager. There, you will tell us your Warehouse 23 email address, provide your physical address, and pay for shipping. You will also have the chance to add more items to your rewards package. See the FAQ for estimated shipping costs.\nFailure to complete your BackerKit survey by the deadline (which will be announced in a Kickstarter update once the pledge manager opens) will result in a refund and removal from the project. We cannot allow projects to remain open forever; we must set firm deadlines so that we can properly close campaigns.\nIf you wish, you may choose to use a fulfillment service. This allows you to pledge for the project and then provide us with a U.S. address for the delivery of your rewards. Forwarding from the fulfillment service, as well as any local fees, is your responsibility when using a fulfillment company. \nNOTE: Taxes, where applicable, will be charged in BackerKit.\nBecause of the increased complexity and expense of international shipping, this project is limited to U.S. backers only. If the campaign succeeds we will offer both the Illuminated Manuscript and 1976 Ogre Playtest Booklet at our online store, Warehouse 23.

Apparently I like to design what my backers want so a queen piece for the dwarves will be available to purchase from Wargame Vault at the conclusion of this campaign. \nDwarven Queen\n\nThere has also been some demand for the magical tile designs from the 'Kings in Conflict' Kickstarter campaign, so that too will be available as an add on from Wargame Vault.  \nAll files were printed using fdm printers (an Up Box + and an Ender 3 Pro) and used rafts and supports. They were designed using 3ds Max and ZBrush and have been run through a repair tool.\n\nYou can try out a test sample of the dragon pawn here:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4746584 \n\nSome examples of printed and painted models.\n\n The chess pieces can be printed as one piece or as two pieces - a top and a base which push fit together. There is also an optional base cap that can be printed but needs to be glued on.\n\nThe chess board is comprised of three designs -  the corner, the side and the centre pieces. The chess tiles are slotted in on top of that.\nPLAY\n\nFor extra rigidity I've glued my board down to a piece of wood.\n\n\nFulfillment of 'Dwarves vs Dragons' will be completed through WargameVault. Each backer will receive copies via their account. Fulfillment will begin as soon as possible. This should hopefully be within 2 weeks of the project funding. A survey will be sent out shortly after the project has funded to gather email addresses associated with WargameVault accounts. Please note, this is the only way to gain these files. You will then have the files in your library so you can access them as often as you would like.

Not fancy. It's all very DIY and all the work is done by me. I've been noodling on hacking up a d100 OGL system for a while, and I'd been tinkering with the ruleset during down hours. So I sat down and finished it, did some layout stuff on it, and built this Kickstarter page, all in six hours. \nShort of drawing all the art myself, it doesn't get more DIY than that. (I debated drawing the art myself, but I figured I'd spare you.)\nSo. Swordpoint is a d100 swashbuckling-themed zine using the Legend OGL (from Mongoose Publishing). The tone and theme is inspired by Musketeers, Captain Alatriste, and European Continent around the 1600s, as well as older games like En Garde, Flashing Blades, and more.\nThe rules are condensed to about 60 pages in a 5\"x8\" landscape format. I always wanted to try a landscape book, and I like how they read on tablets and phones, so I figured why not.\nI did all the layout myself, so it's not super fancy, but I tried to keep it simple and functional. \nWhat it has:\nThe rules you need to play. A hacked d100 system (it'll feel familiar if you know d100 RPGs.)\nNew rules for this iteration of the d100 RPG: Style points. Streamlined combat. A lightweight magic system. \nGenre rules for grudges, revenge, rank, duels, and some enemies (not many enemies though. Like 3.)\nA planned compatibility license.\n PDF bookmarks. I just learned how to do that this morning!\nCharacter sheet mock-up I made. We'll see.\nWhat it doesn't have:\nLots of rules.\nLots of art. Most of the art is from Shutterstock or public domain. There's only like 5-6 pieces in the book total, just to fill white space.\nFancy layout. Remember: DIY and I am not a layout artist. It should be pretty straightforward and easy to read though.\nStretch goals (at least right now.)\nThe writing is probably kinda dry. I wrote in very technical style, 'cause I was inspired by older RPGs (one of my proof-readers even commented on that, so I figure I'll warn you.)\nLayout Sample\n\nThe Plan\nOnce we close, I'll send the PDF out to backers to submit feedback. I think we got most of the errors, but I've learned not to count on that. I'll incorporate the feedback. Then we'll go to print and delivery. No muss, no fuss. \nShipping\nPhysical is shipping to the US only. Sorry. It sucks and I hate having to restrict it but it's too easy to lose money or get caught unawares by shipping changes (hey Brexit.) \nExtra will be available via the GKG webstore after the campaign though, so if you want, you can get it then and we'll try to give you the best rate possible. \nGKG has shipped thousands of packages, so it should be pretty straightforward.

NEW OPTION: HIGH ELVEN! VOTE NOW!\nVOTE NOW!\nThe system is pretty simple! Each month, you choose a theme and we create assets that are matching that theme for the Townbuilder, as well as a number of print-ready buildings that you can download immediately.\nIf you back this Kickstarter you will receive a code that will, once redeemed, automatically unlock the release for the current month and all following months for the duration you backed for.\nIf you are supporting any miniature sculptors on Patreon, you will already have an idea how such a system plays out. The only difference is, that you will get buildings and customization assets instead of miniatures, and they will be available on townsmith.de instead of google drive/MyAirBridge/Sync.\nAccess to the Townbuilder Software is not included in the subscription, but also not necessarily needed. Please read the section \"TB not included\" for more information.\n\nBasically, each release is a number of models (Walls, Floors, Doors, Windows, Roofs, etc...) that are fitting the theme of that month and are automatically unlocked for your account as soon as they are available.\nAdditionally, we will create a number of print-ready, support-free buildings, that you can download as a zip file that includes everything you need. You can also customize the buildings with any models of prior releases or our last Kickstarter in the Townbuilder.\nThere are a total of 6 releases planned in this Kickstarter, with more to come if the system is profitable. Depending on your pledge you receive a total of 3 or 6 such releases!\n\nSubscribing after these initial 6 months is optional and you will be asked if you want to stay subscribed when you enter your activation codes.\nWe would love for you to stay subscribed and allow us to expand the Townbuilder each month for a long time, but you can also use this Kickstarter without binding yourself to a subscription and just get the 6 months of assets and buildings.\n\nNow let's talk about our last Kickstarter, Townbuilder Unlimited, which was really successful and allowed us to make the Townbuilder much bigger than we ever anticipated! But as many of you know, that Kickstarter has not yet been completely fulfilled. But as you can see in the delivery dates, there is plenty of time for us to finish the last stretch goals before the first monthly release is due.\nWhat we have learned from our last Kickstarter and from running this company for more than a year now is that the most valuable things out there are information and time. If we know which and how many models and buildings we have to create 4 months before the first release rolls out, it will improve the product quality and lower our stress level significantly.\n\nHere we would like to show you the concept art for the already chosen themes, as well as the options for the later releases.\nPLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS JUST CONCEPT ART. HOW DETAILED AND VARIED THE 3D MODELS WILL BE DEPENDS ON THE UNLOCKED STRETCH GOALS.\nCheck the \"Monthly Release\" section to see a daily update on how much has been unlocked. \nClick to see more details!\nClick to see more details!\nClick to vote!\nSeptember, October, November: Will be determined after August has been voted\n\nYou can choose in which month you'll start your 3-month subscription. If Draconic, Aztec, or the voted theme in august isn't your thing, you can skip these months and start your subscription with the September release.\n\nI assume that most people who stumble across this Kickstarter are either backers of our last campaign or bought the Townbuilder shortly after on MMF, BackerKit or in our store.\nBut for those of you who are new to Townsmith, here is a quick overview:\nPLAY\n\nWe really can't explain what the Townbuilder is any better than our info page can: Townbuilder Info Page\nTLDR: The Townbuilder is a web-based custom creator for 3D-printable buildings for tabletop games. You can combine small building blocks, such as walls, floors, roofs, and stairs, into complete buildings.\nAh, and of course, if you don't own the Townbuilder yet, you should head over to our store and have a look at it! There are already plenty of models that you can use to create buildings.\nIf you decide to get the Townbuilder, I HIGHLY recommend watching our User Guide Youtube Playlist, it helps a lot with getting started!\n\n\nAbout a year and a half has passed since Tom and I had the idea for the Townbuilder. Initially, it started as a side project next to our university studies.\nWell, we're certainly not at that point anymore. We had a very successful Kickstarter last year and since then the Townbuilder has gone from Open Beta to Early Access 0.1-0.4 and finally to Townbuilder v1.0.\nBut what exactly has improved and changed in the software since you last saw it on Kickstarter?\nImproved Performance\nIncreased Server capacities by a factor of 10\nImplemented under the hood services that allow us to better monitor the performance and problems of the Townbuilder\nImplemented OpenLOCK capabilities\nDeveloped our own peg and magnet system, allowing for 1-6mm magnets and pegs to be placed on almost any model\nCreated a peg placement mode that makes it much more convenient to place pegs\nEnabled scaling of the exported building to a variety of popular scales\nStarted a partner system to get models of other designers into the Townbuilder\nAdded Fillerblocks, a way to fill out empty space or use them as placeholders (cube, cylinder, prism, floor-like)\nAdded a grouping system that gives the user full control over which models are exported as one STL\nAdded a group linking system that expands the grouping functionality to allow for multiple floors to be linked together for export\nAdded Building Blocks, a way of saving and importing whole buildings into your workspace, enabling creative users to fully modularize their building process\nAdded animations to different elements\nReworked the entire GUI making it responsive on smaller and larger monitors.\nCreated the Signbuilder, a sub-application for the Townbuilder, with which you can create signs with custom text and logos that can be used in the Townbuilder\nFixed 500+ bugs\nHad the servers burn down 3 times\nWIP on (semi-)automatic mesh repair using Netfabb so models can be used in all slicers (Simplify3D users rejoice!)\nWIP on a link sharing system, that allows users to share their builds via unique URLs\nWIP on creative mode that allows users to build with all existing assets, save and share the building, but not export it as an STL\nWIP on on-click merchant integration that will allow users to send out print-commission request to our licensed merchants directly from the Townbuilder\n\nWe will also post this in the FAQ, but just to be clear:\nDoes the subscription include access to the software?\nNO, IT DOESN'T. THIS KICKSTARTER IS JUST ABOUT A MONTHLY EXPANSION OF MODELS AND PRINT-READY BUILDINGS!\n\nIf you backed our last Kickstarter, you already got a lifetime license to the Townbuilder.\nThis system will not change and will remain as it is for the foreseeable future. We do not charge you extra, nor do we give new people cheaper options to get the Townbuilder.\n\nYou can back this Kickstarter without owning the Townbuilder and you will still get all the STLs for the buildings. However, you will not be able to customize them unless you backed our last Kickstarter or you specifically backed one of the following reward tiers:\nTownbuilder Advanced + 6 Months Subscription\nTownbuilder Pro + 6 Months Subscription\nTownbuilder All In\n\nWith this Kickstarter, our stretch goals will depend on the number of backers, NOT on the money raised. That is because this number gives us a rough estimate of how many subscribers we will have in any given month.\nSince you can back for just three or for six months, or for a pledge level that includes both the Townbuilder and a subscription, each individual backer will contribute different amounts of money. This means we use the backer number as a rough estimate of our monthly subscriber count, which in return allows us to determine the variety and detail level of a monthly release.\nBelow you can see the different detail levels that can be unlocked on some example buildings from the Draconic and Aztec theme. \nThe roadmap also includes print-ready, support free buildings of all previously created sets. These will be built once, not on a monthly basis, and will be made available to all backers in the same way as the ones from the monthly releases. If you have access to the sets these buildings were built with, you will be able to customize them in the Townbuilder, otherwise, you will only have access to the print-ready version.\n\n\nOur current Merchant License System is really really simple. You pay 35\u20ac per month and you can sell as many prints of Townbuilder buildings as you want.\nThis does include all the print-ready buildings that we will create with this Kickstarter.\nFor more information, check out our License Agreement.\nIf you want to become a Townbuilder Merchant, check out our store!\n\nAs you may know, we have opened the Townbuilder up to external content. This means that we implement models by other creators as well as our users into the Townbuilder.\nIf you want to know more about this, and want to suggest a creator to us, or get your models into the Townbuilder, send us a message via partners@townsmith.de.\n\nWe are Townsmith. This sentence meant a lot to us when we launched our very first Kickstarter over a year ago. And it only continued to grow in meaning when the Kickstarter exploded beyond all expectations on the second attempt. Since then, our team has grown, and so has the responsibility of all of us.\nWe are very happy to say that we still have the same spirit that originally brought us to this.\nWe are just a group of nerds who love DnD and 3D printing and creating cool tools for our hobby!\n\n\nIf you want to get in touch with us, the best way is via Discord. We have a very active server with over 1800 users. Feel free to join our community, we are always happy to help you out!\nWe also post regular updates on Instagram and Facebook.\nAnd then, of course, you should subscribe to our Youtube Channel if you want to get notified whenever we make more user guides.\nIf you have business-inquiries or want to talk about collaborations in general, please send us an email at business@townsmith.de\nIf you are interested in becoming a partner and getting your models in the Townbuilder, please contact us via partners@townsmith.de", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have now almost fulfilled one of the biggest digital Kickstarters in the 3D printing scene.\nWe have gone through the insane challenge of getting a company of 10 people up and running. And it has been running cleanly for about 4 months now (Our initial Kickstarter launched 7 months ago).\n\nWe have a team of 5 artists and 1 technician working on getting hundreds of models in the Townbuilder and Tom and I are always available to fix any technical issues that might come up.\nAnd we are ready to expand our team if we reach higher stretch goals and the funding is there. If this system makes 50k a month, rest assured that most of it will directly influence the amount and quality of the models we make, while the rest will go into research and development for the next builder. Wait did I just spoil that we are coding another custom builder? No one reads this section anyway, won't do any harm. For the few of you that do keep posted and look for some green in the wild of our website, you might find some hints soon ;)\n\nStill, there are some risks we simply cannot account for:\nA) Longevity. We survived the 'valley of death', that destroys so many start-ups. However, we still cannot guarantee how long the service will live. This Kickstarter is meant to provide us much more safe planning for the next 6 months, but who knows how much money we will make with this system afterward. And if it doesn't pay for the artists, we will not be able to continue the subscriptions.\n\nB) Times of uncertainty. We all know that 2020 just ended, and it taught us, that it can always get worse. So if the world collapses into an economic crisis, a war breaks out or half of our team dies, we will simply not be able to recover. Stuff like this will cause this project to fail since we just don't have millions on the side or 200 employees.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSustainable Distribution\nPure Digital Shipping", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac40 or more", "title": "3 Monthly Releases", "descp": "10% saved versus a monthly subscription after the Kickstarter\nWith this reward, you will get an activation code which will begin a free 3-month subscription for our Townbuilder SubSystem.\nThis means you will get access to 3 monthly model releases\n(check the campaign description to see what 1 release includes as this is expanded over the course of the campaign)\nINCLUDES:\n3\u00d7 monthly releases\nVote for the themes starting in August", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}], "stat": ["26 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac60 or more", "title": "6 Monthly Releases", "descp": "33% saved versus a monthly subscription after the Kickstarter\nWith this reward, you will get an activation code which will begin a free 6-month subscription for our Townbuilder SubSystem.\nYou can activate this code at any time, so feel free to skip the months that don't interest you!\nThis means you will get access to 6 monthly releases\n(check the campaign description to see what 1 release includes as this is expanded over the course of the campaign)\nINCLUDES:\n6\u00d7 monthly releases\nVote for the themes starting in August", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}], "stat": ["188 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac80 or more", "title": "Townbuilder Advanced+6 Monthly Releases", "descp": "ONLY BACK IF YOU DID NOT SUPPORT OUR LAST KICKSTARTER AND NEED A TOWNBUILDER EDITION, NOT JUST MODELS!!!\nFor more information on what the Advanced Edition and the Medieval Set are, please check the campaign description!\nINCLUDES:\nTownbuilder Advanced Edition\n6\u00d7 monthly releases\nMedieval Set\nVote for the themes starting in August", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}], "stat": ["12 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac100 or more", "title": "Townbuilder Pro+6 Monthly Releases", "descp": "ONLY BACK IF YOU DID NOT SUPPORT OUR LAST KICKSTARTER AND NEED A TOWNBUILDER EDITION, NOT JUST MODELS!!!\nFor more information on what the Pro Edition and the Medieval Set are, please check the campaign description!\nINCLUDES:\nTownbuilder Pro Edition\n6\u00d7 monthly releases\nMedieval Set\nVote for the themes starting in August", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}], "stat": ["7 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac200 or more", "title": "Townbuilder All In", "descp": "ONLY BACK IF YOU DID NOT SUPPORT OUR LAST KICKSTARTER AND WANT EVERYTHING FROM THERE AS WELL!!!\nYou will get a total value of 291\u20ac at 31% off for only 200\u20ac.

This Kickstarter provides support-free minis, scatter terrain, space ships of all sizes, vehicles, and more for you to produce at home on your FDM or resin 3D printer. Rewards are for digital STL files to print the products shown and described in this campaign. Rewards are split into three categories: Scatter/Terrain,  Space Ships/Vehicles, and Minis - designed to be used together or independently, and all for normal tabletop gaming scale (28-32mm). All these models should work great for games like Starfinder, Star Wars Legion, Fifth Age (5e), Dark Matter (5e), and Cyberpunk games like Infinity (Note that each of those games listed  have all rights reserved, and this campaign is not affiliated or associated with those brands or trademarks).\n\n** PLEASE NOTE - This Kickstarter is for digital files (STLs) to make all these items on your own home 3D printer - these are not physical goods **\n\n**NEW BACKERS** - This project is successfully funded, and ALL the 15 planned stretch goals have been unlocked! There's over 70 support-free minis,  12 larger vehicles/ships, and 175+ scatter STLs included!\n-- click to view zoomable high-res version. Photos are a mix of resin and FDM prints. Some content shown may be part of stretch goals --\nThis project includes a large collection of thematic minis including aliens, creatures, characters, NPCs, androids, drones, and more!\nHigh-quality miniatures, suitable for resin-level detail but also great quality on FDM printers\n NO supports are needed for any of these miniatures, in resin or FDM. This is accomplished by smart posing and design, and slicing/keying where needed.\nAll models have been test printed and ready to drop on print bed and go.\nAll minis are included in based versions (pictured below), and also unbased for you to base yourself, use in dioramas, etc. Where split/keyed versions are needed, complete versions are also offered for those that want them. Some are designed to use with flight bases, such as these free ones I have on Thingiverse or the great ones by LITKO . I also released all the mini bases from this project for free HERE. \nWHY SUPPORT-FREE? Support-free is not just for FDM printing, it works GREAT for resin too. Support-free designs have many benefits, including being generally harder to break during travel and play (thicker components, merged geometry), less prone to print failure, and less (if any) cleanup and post-processing. You can throw a bunch on your printer, walk away, and come back confident - and get more models on your table faster!\n\nThe minis range in size from small creatures, to HUGE alien beasts. Scale is roughly 32mm (similar in size to Reaper Bones). The below image shows renders of all the models included with the minis set, and will be updated as stretch goals are unlocked.\n-- click to view high-res zoomable version --\n-- click for high-res zoomable version --\n---------------------------------------\nEvery space port needs some space ships! This project includes many space ships of various types and sizes - ranging from large, multi floor ships to small, sleek fighters. All ships are designed to print and assemble on FDM printers of most sizes, and designed to open for easy play and detailed interiors (many of the ships and vehicles will fit on resin printers as well). There's also many other interesting vehicles to help flesh out your space sport and scifi locations. They are all sized for play similar to the minis and terrain (28-32mm). Like everything in this Kickstarter, the vehicles print support-free, with the exception of a few odd-shaped pieces like window glass. Check em out:\n-- click to view high-res zoomable version --\n-- click to view high-res zoomable version --\n---------------------------------------\nThis project has all kinds of fun, modular terrain and scenery to build a wealth of different environments like cantinas,  warehouses, landing pads, gambling dens, outdoor markets, and more. It's far-future Scifi in theme, but much is styled to work great with near-future Cyberpunk as well. All items print support free, and are split/designed/optimized for easy printing, painting, and assembly (if needed). The below image shows renders of all the models in some sample configurations included with the scatter set & all-in pledge levels, and will be updated as stretch goals are unlocked:\n-- click to view high-res zoomable version --\n-- click to view zoomable high-res version --\n---------------------------------------\nI have all kinds of stretch goals planned - enough to nearly triple the core reward content! You can see what's unlocked in the graphic below. Unless otherwise noted, the models that are unlocked are in the previews above. Some stretch goals will be mini focused, some scatter, some a big vehicle, and others a mix - but I am attempting to balance the added stuff overall.\n[UPDATE: all stretch goals have been unlocked, nearly tripling the rewards content! ]\n---------------------------------------\nWho doesn't like free stuff? There's many free items released, and more coming, to sweeten the pot and give you something to print while the KS is in progress. \nI have released my second set of SCIFI DUNGEONSTICKS, which you can download and print right now. You can access all the other free releases in THIS THINGIVERSE COLLECTION. In addition, all the bases I have designed for this campaign are available for free HERE (which match my last free set of SCIFI BASES). The previous free/bonus models from my last scifi project, The Ignis Quadrant are also perfect test examples of the quality of what's in this project, available HERE.\n\nNOTE: Thingiverse has been flakey lately - if things aren't loading for you, you can download the free preview files and bases in Dropbox HERE. \n\nAlso I teamed up with Ben over at 2nd Dynasty to offer a sweet discount for his huge, epic starships! Click the banner below to visit his MMF store and use the code NovusLandingShips for 30% off, until Feb 28, 2021.\n--------------------------------------\nAs the universe of The Ignis Quadrant has continued to grow beyond my first two scifi STL kickstarters, I decided to create and Kickstart a professionally-drawn comic book series as well! The first 2 issues (Chapter #0 and Chapter #1) are released, with the next chapter coming soon. Many of the characters and environments in this project are reflected in the comic book. If you're a scifi fan (which we assume you are, since you're here!) we absolutely encourage you to check out the comic. You can read the free chapter #0 online for free RIGHT HERE, and buy the digital issue #1 RIGHT HERE\n--------------------------------------\nMy name is Evan Carothers, and I am a 3D designer and tabletop game accessory creator with hundreds of designs released via Thingiverse (ecaroth) and through my premium design company (EC3D). This is my 8th Kickstarter, and any of my thousands of customers can tell you about my track record of easy-to-print models - delivered on time. My skill and love for design has grown out of my passion for tabletop gaming, technology, and 3D printing. I design much of the content myself and work with many other great designers and artists to put these projects together. This is my third Scifi project but it's gonna be epic! You can take a look through my previous projects to get a feel for my team's design aesthetic, or check out some customer reviews. I am a tabletop gamer at heart, and all models are  printed, and often painted, by myself before being released.\n\nParticipating Modelers, Artists, Painters, and Printers\nCredit to these awesome folks who helped this all come together!\n\nJoshua Black, Sebastiano Di Grazia, Vitaliy Deaf, Ben Southall (Yasashii Kyojin Studio),  Ryan Calhoun (Cephalopod Studios), Povilas Selila, Alexander Buryak, Julia Kuznetsova (PolyGrimm), and Ulises Virgen.\nAdd-ons allow you to get additional awesome stuff at a great discount, and help push even further to unlock stretch goals! My previous projects have all been fantasy, but I know plenty of gamers play both scifi and fantasy, so I decided to offer them regardless. To get add-ons, just increase your pledge level by the amount indicated for whichever add-ons you would like. Once the KS closes I will be using a pledge manager (BackerKit) to help you finalize you add-ons. You can increase you pledge on KS now to help fund stretch goals, or get these after the campaign closes.\n\nTo add any STL stretch goals you must back the campaign at a level that includes STLs. If you only wish to\n The Terra Conflict - My most recent 3D printable Kickstarter, full of space-combat scale ships, creatures, terrain, and more for epic space battles and encounters. This add-on is equivalent to what's included in the '3D Printable STL Files' pledge level of The Terra Conflict, including unlocked stretch goals ($30 add-on for the base set, and $42 for the base set + both add-on fleets).\n The Ignis Quadrant: My first foray into scifi, featuring support-free minis, tons of vehicles and lots of scatter terrain for all your scifi RPG and wargaming needs! The Ignis Quadrant - The add-ons are is equivalent to what's included in all-in pledge level, (including unlocked stretch goals): Minis, Terrain/Scatter, or Vehicles (1 set for $25) or ALL IN (all 3 sets for $50).\n Empire of Scorching Sands: My last sprawling campaign, featuring Arabian/Persian/Egyptian/desert terrain/scatter, monsters, and minis - Empire of Scorching Sands - the add-ons are equivalent to the what's included in that campaign (including stretch goals): Terrain/scatter only ($20 add-on), Minis only ($20 add-on), or ALL IN ($30 add-on).\n Wilds of Wintertide: A chilly, northern project featuring icy, arctic tundra, terrain/scatter, monsters, and minis - Wilds of Wintertide - the add-ons are equivalent to the what's included in that campaign (including stretch goals): Terrain/scatter only ($18 add-on), Minis only ($18 add-on), or ALL IN ($25 add-on).\n A Den of Alien Evil - Everything from the first volume of my \"Community (Treasure)Chest\" series - Mind Horror scenery, terrain, and minis. Check it out the content from the original campaign HERE ($10 add-on).\n Secret of the Crimson Troupe - Everything from the second volume of my \"Community (Treasure)Chest\" series - A wandering troupe with a dark secret! Check it out the content from the original campaign HERE ($15 add-on).\n The Holy Order of Ash - Everything from the third volume of my \"Community (Treasure)Chest\" series - A dark holy order! Check it out the content from the original campaign HERE ($15 add-on).\n Depths of Savage Atoll: A sprawling campaign, featuring nautical, jungle, pirate, and undersea minis and environs - Depths of Save Atoll - the add-ons are equivalent to the what's included in that campaign (including stretch goals): Terrain/scatter only ($35 add-on), Minis only ($35 add-on), or ALL IN ($65 add-on).\n Skyless Realms: The races and places below the surface, from my previous campaign Skyless Realms  - the add-ons are equivalent to what's included in that campaign (including stretch goals): Terrain only ($40 add-on), Minis only ($35 add-on), or ALL IN ($55 add-on).\n Forest of Oakenspire - Everything from the core reward and stretch goals from my first Kickstarter Forest of Oakenspire at a great discount ($40 add-on).\n All EC3D Premium Sets - The full collection of all 12 previously released premium sets - over $100 value, as seen for sale on Hero's Hoard ($50 add-on)\n Individual EC3D Premium Sets - Chose any number of my EC3D scenery sets from my previously released premium set collection - substantial value over retail price, as seen for sale on Hero's Hoard ($5 per-set add-on)\n** Please note ** - all the add-on items above can be purchased right now for a higher price on heroshoard.com or late pledge pages for those campaigns, but if you are willing to wait until this campaign closes to receive the files you can get a great discount AND help unlock more stuff for this current campaign.\n\nI have an official licensed printer program for my 3D sets, along with my partner at Hero's Hoard, which allows commercial physical resellers with a 10% commission on sales. Anybody can signup for that license, and sell the models from this campaign under that license, and I will not be doing specific merchant tiers for this campaign. So to sell these files (and other non-exclusive EC3D sets) you just need to signup for that resale program and back this campaign to receive the files.\nEverybody hates waiting, and many people have been burned by poorly designed files and broken delivery timelines in previous kickstarters from other vendors. This is not the case with my campaigns. All core models, and many stretch goals, area already finalized and test printed - and the majority of files will be ready for delivery the second the funds clear after the Kickstarter finishes (usually 2 weeks after the date the campaign ends). I will be finalizing and releasing the remaining items as fast as humanly possible, with a goal of 90 days *MAX* after this Kickstarter ends for delivery - which is something I have successfully done for all my previous Kickstarters. Please note, historically I wait until I have released everything from one project to launch another, but I have a fantasy STL project launching right after this one, which is smaller in scope and already completed, and I'm confident will not slow my planned release schedule for Novus Landing.\n\nDisclaimer & Printing Requirements\n\nTo get the most out of the printable parts from this Kickstarter, you will need to have a well-tuned 3D printer. For terrain/scatter and FDM printer capable of printing at a minimum .2mm layer height (ideally <= .16mm), such as an Ender 3.  Parts are cut to small pieces to facilitate printing. All designs for terrain are cut and keyed to fit on a 200x200mm print bed.  For minis, a resin printer is ideal and all mini models are cut/keyed (only as needed) to fit on standard sized smaller resin print beds (such as an Anycubic Photon), with the exception of a few VERY large minis and some large spaceship parts. Minis will print on FDM printers as well - for a few of the more challenging models you might need to slow the print down a bit, but no supports will be needed.\n\nEvery part is test printed by myself and repaired to be manifold and ready to drop on your slicer - however, In the event that any issues with the files get past my own QA testing and process, and my other test printers, I will make every effort to fix the file and remedy the situation as soon as possible. I use Dropbox for file delivery so I can push updates/fixes.

It draws on aspects from another Schiller's work - the famous historical drama Wallenstein and the theme of the 30 Years' War.\n\"Numbered\" Limited Edition Displayed (Whole Metallic Gold-Inked Tuck)\n Features:\nPrinted by USPCC on Classic Stock\nPoker Size\nEmbossed (Linen) Finish \n52 Cards + 2 Extra 17th-century Jokers + 2 Extra Collectible 16th-century Art Cards \nMetallic Ink On Box & Card Backs (Both Versions of Tucks and Card Backs inside) \nCustom Seals - Numbered and Standard \nPuzzle Image on all Tuck Spines of the Series (Inking Vary by Tuck Version) \nDigitally Hand-Recreated and Designed by Azured Ox\nProduced By Will Roya\nAfter the success of the first blue 1805 and the second green 1806 Cotta's almanac decks, again we come with two versions of the third yellow 1807 Cotta's deck limited edition - the \"Numbered\" and the \"Standard\".\nAs campaigns before, we are limiting this 3rd \"Numbered\" deck to only 1,000 copies of tuck which is the whole gold-inked with custom numbered seals. Additional \"Standard\" limited edition decks are created just with a slight difference on tuck designed with dark and gold ink combination and the same custom seals (non-numbered). Both versions will include the same gold metallic inked card back design inside of the tuck box. \nThere are many historical values in the series of decks...\nThat's why the entire 6 deck series is in many ways designed by Azured Ox to meet collector's demand as a \"collection of historical books\" with their mysteries and secrets hidden inside up to your findings...\nSeries of decks will be produced with the piece of puzzle image on each tuck \"book\" spine (left side of the box) to create together a nice display of the Tuebingen monument surroundings, where the idea for Cotta's decks was born. \nPuzzle Spine Image \"Digital Demonstration\" to present Ink Combinations of Both Tuck Versions\nIf you are interested in more information about historical details with a profound and beautiful story behind Cotta's Almanac playing cards creation and idea, or about the famous and noble people connected to these unique transformation playing card decks, you can find reading after scrolling down this project page. \nThe design of both versions of Cotta's limited edition tuck boxes, the standard and the numbered, created by Azured Ox, have been inspired by the old books and published writers' work using the gold ink on their covers as well as combined with the dark ink.\nInking and Tuck Design Inspired by Old Books\nUnexplained stories, hidden mysteries, secrets...\nMuch of historical happenings, influences, and activities would find a place in the Cotta decks, including events in the life of Cotta's own family and notable figures like Schiller and Goethe. Other important influences include the literature, art, history, politics (e.g. Napoleon's invasion), and religious reforms of the time, which all served as an important context to shape the art in the decks themselves... \n Third almanac deck: \"Wallenstein\" (Year 1807) \nAfter the first blue deck themed on Joan of Arc play by Schiller, and the second green deck themed on Jean Racine's plays, which were translated into the German language by Schiller, here in the third yellow deck, again the images on the court cards are the characters from another Schiller's work, the three parts historical drama play Wallenstein centered around the 30 Years' War (1618\u20131648). In Wallenstein were embodied the fateful forces of his time.\nThe central figure - Albrecht Wenzel Eusebius von Wallenstein, sometimes von Waldstein (24 September 1583 \u2013 25 February 1634), is depicted as the King of Hearts. \nHe was a prince of the German Empire and a Bohemian (westernmost region of Czech republic) military leader and statesman who fought on the Catholic side during the Thirty Years' War of which he was a major figure. \nHe belonged to the men of the Renaissance and the world of the Baroque, but also he stood above these categories as an exceptional individual. Raised bilingually, he went beyond Czech or German nationality, beyond Catholic or Protestant denominations.\nHis successful martial career made him one of the richest and most influential men in the Holy Roman Empire by the time of his death. Wallenstein became the supreme commander of the armies of the Habsburg Emperor Ferdinand II.\nFor his successes, Wallenstein became an Imperial count palatine and made himself ruler of the lands of the Duchy of Friedland in northern Bohemia.\n\"Wallensten Herzog zu Friedland\" (Lettered on King of Heart Court Card)\nIt's not all just about Schiller's famous works...\nAs the first blue and the second green deck before, also this third yellow deck was threaded by majestic and noble roots, nay of one more person... Besides the noble publisher of the deck, Johann Friedrich Cotta, there were two other persons involved in the graphical part of this deck creation. \nJohann Friedrich Cotta (April 27, 1764 - December 29, 1832)\nFor the third time, again, cards were designed and stipple engraved by Countess Mary Day von Jennison-Walworth (sometimes spelled with a single 'n'). Her maiden name was Beauclerk, and she was the wife of Count Francis Jenison Walworth (1764\u20131824).\nProbably, she was creating illustrations for decks in Stuttgart (detected from letter communication addressed to her mother in Britain that contained writings about the Cotta's decks...), and so there in Stuttgart, she might put additional historical value into her playing cards creation by mutual cooperation due to her artistic passion & connections network - images on cards of this deck were mostly based on sketches and preliminary brush drawings by well-known Christian Wilhelm von Faber du Faur from Stuttgart. \nNot only from a noble baron family with French roots of ancestors, he was an army officer, soldier, and lieutenant in the 25th Division, which was the W\u00fcrttemberg unit during the Napoleonic Wars, and also a painter focused on the war theme. \nHis involvement is indicated by writing at the base of the 10 of Clubs, which says \"Christian Faber du Faur inv. et del.\" \nSix Unique Different Card Back Patterns Designed, with Regard to Card Handling, Individually for Each of the Cotta's Deck Year Almanacs. \nClassic Style Borderless Full-Bleed Card Back Design with Luxury Feeling and Metallic Ink\nThe Same Gold Metallic Ink Card Back Design for Both Editions of the Cotta's Deck\nAces\nThe publisher's name was placed on the Ace of Clubs as follows: \"A Tubinge chez J. G. Cotta, Libraire.\"\nSpades\nHearts\nClubs\nDiamonds\nIn contrast to previous Cotta's decks issues where the court cards were designated with the words \"Valet\", \"Dame\", and \"Roi\", which are the French terms corresponding to the Jack, Queen, and King, here on the court cards of this 3rd issue, Jack and Queen are not described, only King is described with Crown at upper Left.\nThe central figure of Albrecht von Wallenstein, the Duke of Friedland who served the Holy Roman Emperor in the Thirty Year's War, is represented as the King of Hearts. \nAlso depicted are his general Christian von Ilow (\"Illo\", King of Spades), and his lieutenant Octavio Piccolomini (King of Clubs). Instead of following his intelligence, Wallenstein foolishly followed his astrologer Baptista Seni (Jack of Hearts). By his many schemes involving multiple countries, Wallenstein eventually found himself in a position where nobody could trust him. Piccolomini was one of Wallenstein's assassins, along with the English captain Walter Devereux (Jack of Clubs). Other contemporaries of Wallenstein that are depicted include his wife, the Duchess of Friedland (Queen of Hearts).\n\nSome characters blur the line between fiction and reality. This includes Countess Terzky (Queen of Spades), who in real life was Wallenstein's wife's sister, but takes on fictional actions in Schiller's play. Wallenstein's secretary Newman (Jack of Spades) also makes an appearance, but in the deck becomes the fictional cavalry captain and assistant of Count Terzky. Max Piccolomini (King of Diamonds), the son of the killer Octavio Piccolomini, is also a fictitious character. The same is true of Wallenstein's princess and daughter Thekla (Queen of Diamonds), her servant von Rosenberg (Jack of Diamonds), and her lady-in-waiting Fraulein Neubrunn (Queen of Clubs). \nNeumann (Cavalry Captian, Terzky\u2019s adjutant) \nGraefin Terzky (Countess, Sister of the Duchess) \nIllo (Field Marshal, Wallenstein\u2019s Confidant)\nSeni (Baptista Seni, Astrologer)\nHerzogin zu Friedland (Duchess, Wallenstein\u2019s wife) \nWallenstein Herzog zu Friedland (Duke, Imperial General in the Thirty Years\u2019 War)\nDeveroux (Walter, Captain, Irish Assassin of Illo, Terzky and Albrecht von Wallenstein) \nFraeulein Neubrunn (Lady Companion to Theckla)\nOctavio Piccolomini (Lieutenant General) \nv. Rosenberg (Von Rosenberg, Equerry/Ostler to Theckla)\nTheckla (Princess Friedland, Daughter of Wallenstein's)  \nMax Piccolomini (Octavio's Son, Colonel of a Cuirassier Regiment) \nAt last, we came with an idea to reflect the opposite of noble life and to bring closer to you even more of the unique artistic history placed on extra collectible playing cards...\nAlso, we thought it could be interesting to put other illustrations from the far past on the additional extra cards, in respect to year almanacs, we came with an idea of twelve calendar months in the series as an exclusive collection of unique historical artworks...\nWith the Elements of Heraldic Achievement...\nIncludes heraldry symbols connected with the family and past of the noble designer countess Jenison von Walworth who created most of the Cotta's decks... \nAn absolutely original playing card masterpiece to hang on your wall (double-sided) \nAdd-ons will be made available post campaign based on availability.

Each deck would focus on a different theme...\nForming a \"Card Almanac\" (Karten Almanach), each card in the deck would represent one of the 52 weeks in a calendar year. At the time it was popular to print various almanacs, which were special pocketbooks for the new year, and often included a short poem or quote for each week of the calendar year. It was a logical move to connect each of these 52 weeks with playing cards.\nOriginal illustrations were fiddling artworks - manually stipple engraved & etched on copper plates\n The famous Cotta's publishing house... \n\nThe friendship that gave birth to the idea of Cotta's transformation playing card almanac decks...\nThe color of each tuck box created by Azured Ox has been inspired by Goethe's experimental optic and color theory, since Goethe was an important contemporary of Cotta, along with Schiller.

Over time, you did it less and less: first homework, then the stress of a new job, then...you just didn\u2019t. You were good at drawing once. Never great, but good\u2014and it brought you so much joy. Joy is hard for you to come by these days.\n\nSo begins your journey in below, a solo journaling game about getting lost in a strange, uncomfortable place. Over the course of 10 days, you'll explore a remote area you find yourself trapped in. In responding to the journaling prompts, players are encouraged to draw parts of their responses, even if you don't think that your drawing skills are good. This is a game for you about falling out of your comfort zone.\nIt's important that players understand that below addresses many topics that could be upsetting to players. The narrative of the game addresses depression through metaphor, and as such, for players who aren't in a good place mentally, it may not be the game for you right now.\nIn below, you play someone exploring an area they used to love but no longer feel connected to. At the end of the first day, you fall into a dark, unfamiliar region and cannot find a way out. Over the course of the ten days of the game, you'll keep a record of your explorations through words and images as you endure.\nContent Warnings: below addresses, through metaphor, depression and the disconnection that comes along with it. There are prompts that address falling, being lost, not having food or water, nearly drowning, and harm to an animal caused by predation and its resulting suffering.\n\nThe game will be emailed to you on December 21st, the darkest day of the year. (The rewards say January, but that's because Kickstarter doesn't allow the rewards to be promised for the same month as the campaign.)\nThe writing for the game is finished, and I'm currently doing final playtesting on it. It will be ready to go before the end of the campaign.\nIn terms of art, there's only the cover image for Fergus to do, and they've already taken care of that.\nFergus Ferguson (any pronouns) - Cover Art - is a student and artist, dual majoring in computer science and fine arts at Tufts University. When they are not studying or drawing, they like to play tabletop games, read sci-fi, and tell everyone how great their betta fish is. They can be found on Twitter (@fergusfergyferg).\nDoug Levandowski (he/him) - Design, Writing & Layout - is a teacher and game designer from New Jersey. He has worked on larger RPGs such as Kids on Bikes, Teens in Space, and Kids on Brooms as well as Kickstarter-delivered ones like The Wishing Sigil, Agents of Dice-Ception, and, most recently, Arcane Zoo.

After each player decides which Survivor Character they wish to be, the group selects a Survivor Chapter.\nEvery Survivor Chapter drives a unique story, prepares the board and outlines directives. Some chapters are solitary incidents, and some chapters are part of expansive story arcs that follow a survivor on their saga.\nGame play gets very hands on after this point.\nEach player will gather their first personal bit of biometry by measuring their hand span from thumb to little finger with the built-in ruler. This information is used by the ZOMBIE Framework which is expressed in greater detail further down the page in Ground Breaking Elements. The ZOMBIE Framework is the way this game connects YOU to the board and creates an intricate and dynamic gaming experience without troubling the player with complex calculations or classic pen and dice game mechanics.\nIn this game I decided to call the Zombie opposition 'Thumbies' as a tribute to this unique biometric system. Using the Survivor Chapter and everyone's hand spans the players will populate the board with some Thumbies that were hanging around before the players entered the scene.\nPlayers use a different Hand Span to determines how many items a player can carry in their inventory.\nDuring your quest to survive you will collect hundreds of useful and sometimes not so useful items. Players will need to determine what items they need to keep and which items they must discard or trade. Discovery and circumstances play an important role during every session \u2013 what might have been the game-winning resource management strategy for one session becomes the tragic miscalculation for another. This is one reason why chapters are so addictive and re-playable.\nThe game begins once players finish agreeing who gets which items from the load out deck.\nFound item cards are obtained from Thumbies.\nAnd Board Stock Cards are item cards obtained from specific storage locations situated around the game board.\nThese locations are often locked and require keys or codes to open.\nCards with expendable supply like guns, ammunition and first aid use a tally system situated on their edges instead of small resource tokens that always seem to go missing between game sessions.\nThe tally system on the cards interface with your player board. This is where a player stores their active items, player and survivor card and keeps track of their level and current health.\nAs players make kills the Thumbie tokens are placed in the Player board to count levels, unlocking Survivor Cards. Players draw their Survivor Card at random sometimes finding that a good trait has materialized or a disadvantageous trait has developed. Don't worry, at higher levels player's will have a chance to replace survivor cards as their character becomes more battle hardened.\nDuring game play players try and meet the victory conditions of their Survivor Chapter while pesky Thumbies pour into the game area using the ZOMBIE Framework.\nSometimes unanticipated events are drawn instead of items making hordes of Thumbies pour in or the dreaded All-thumbs Monster to amalgamate. Such examples of events can prove to be a tipping point for survival, and necessitate the groups consensuses to change strategy or perish in disorganized confusion.\nWhen a player gets hit they attribute the damage on their player board condition monitor moving the token on their handy player board.\nThumbies transcends the static game experience again by placing your personal biometrics on the line. The player board condition monitor corresponds to your characters ability to move and function in-game. The result is transmitting game damage into the allowable finger combinations a player is permitted to utilized for actions like, movement, rescuing and attacking.\nUsing the ZOMBIE Framework\u2122 Thumbies\u00ae has broken away from traditional Hex or grid based combat systems liberating the combat experience using an organic versatility. Even attacking is hand rationalized!\nTabletop beginners and veterans will enjoy the quick resolution and sublime game mechanics of Thumbies. And those who are truly paying attention for the high stakes pay-off can capitalize on such game changers with the Build Plan system facilitated by random draw and careful inventory management.\nThumb-mart is the first step on our ambitious journey to bring you more game sets in the Thumbies Series. This game set support hundreds of hours of gaming and exportation, character building and memorable close shaves. It is our goal to provide the most fun and creative gaming experience we can muster; and so Thumbies : Thumbmart was also designed to be integrated with future game sets. Each a stand-alone collection in their own right every set has the ability to link to other sets forming a veritable landscape of epic game play using the ZOMBIE Framework.\nTwo such game sets are already in the works and will be announced early next year. Linking is an option to uncover more story, unlock tiered difficulty chapters and experience the option of longer epic game-play using the special Aftermath Challenges.\n1 Player Solo up to 8 Players Team Game Play\nThumbies\u00ae is engineered to respond to any number of players from a single individual up to eight players using measuring elements obtained at the beginning of game play.\nInnovative Player Board\nThe player board is a cluster of ideas made possible by a tri-layer board developed to alleviate the need for counting chits, counters or pen and paper record keeping. Rationed or expended items use a notch based tally system built into the board keeping the item card in place so a visual representation of its stock can be tallied. Hollows keep a record of character level development with overlapping summaries to track advancement and save space. And the center hand print image with its hollows serve as a reminder to the player for which two fingers to biometrically use when modifying their movement span if and when their character is hurt.\nZOMBIE Framework Whitepaper\nThe integrated math and subsequent engineering model that governs the entire game is called the Z.O.M.B.I.E. Framework \u00ae a smart acronym representing the systems larger more technical name : the (Zone Operational Movement Biometrically Intrinsic Engine). This framework's chief founding purpose is to cloak complex statistics by providing an auto-calculated operation that can be interpolated into actionable game play mechanics like movement, combat, challenges, and other RPG derivatives like abilities. The effective cloaking provides the satisfaction of a statistically rich environment while lessening the computational aspect tabletop games often encounter when rationalizing elaborate game play. This effort, of course, was designed to elevate the gaming experience so players can focus on feelings and fun and let the Framework do the work.\nZOMBIE FRAMEWORK ELEMENT 1 : Board Contour and Features\nThe geometry of the board is made using a series of underpinning theorems that relate to the playable area. Accounting for any number of players between 1 and 8, the individual variance in hand sizes, given trip-related journeys and coverage of selected game play mechanics; token size and weight, the coefficient of friction and zone based occupancy optimization. Mission instructions and card randomization complement these rules... and sometimes break them, thus making up a finely tuned and abstract difficulty tool.\nZOMBIE FRAMEWORK ELEMENT 2 : Hand Biometrics\nTo increase the feel of player relatability to the environment, the ZOMBIE Framework took hand-measurements and turned them into operational character mechanics. The system could have used grid or hexed based models for movement and action resolution but that would have drastically reduced the work achieved in board design; especially considering the effort placed in accounting for the distribution of hand averages in contours and features. Furthermore it would have left out a delicious morsel of biopsychiatry that will be mentioned further in the paper.\nThus, hand biometrics are used to rationalize 100% of character statistics and activities making for an organic feel and a distinct and hitherto unimagined innovation in tabletop gaming. In Thumbies\u00ae digit length, distance between tips, segment lengths, grouping widths, span flexibility, closed and open palm sizes are all utilized biometrics. And due to the unique anatomy of the opposable thumb saddle-joint a special design was employed in this system that sets at the fulcrum of Thumbies\u00ae giving life to the game and its name-sake.\nZOMBIE FRAMEWORK ELEMENT 3 : Board Based Assist\nThe ZOMBIE Framework does not require a game master or any user to move zombies one by one or do any ancillary accounting typically found in classical RPG and tabletop systems. Players can effectively move hundreds of tokens (zombies in this case) with one motion and the aforementioned contours makes them disperse in a meaningful way to create bottlenecking, pincer attacks and the type of movement we all might expect from a massive crowd of thronging creatures\nCulturally speaking the ZOMBIE Framework also acknowledges both the classic definition of zombie (Night of the Living Dead model) as slow shambling throngs but is versatile and robust enough to include other zombie types such as exploding, area effect, running attacking and gargantuation. These all appear in gameplay depending on the survivor chapter, and more continue to be invented as the next boards are designed and the script continues.\nZOMBIE FRAMEWORK ELEMENT 4 : Biopsychiatry\nThe ZOMBIE Framework gives the player an impression of survival because you can physically fight-it-out and make attempts to outmaneuver their foe. Players are connected to the game by the anatomy of their hand and associate their characters' limitations with themselves identifying with game play stronger than dice-deck-dial based systems.\nWe as humans are inextricably tied to learning with our hands and involving our hands when we think and do even when hands are not being employed. This cognitive fact has a biopsychiatry effect that only became realized during the alpha testing of the game. Simply put we felt more invested and tried to survive harder as if our life was on the line. The non-passivity of the game through the frequency of hand use was making us players emotionally chemically invested in the game and not just because we wanted to win but because we thought we could against any and all odds - a thing I realized falls off when you count the odds in traditional dice-deck-dial games. Making Thumbies\u00ae both a fun and fantastic gaming experience and a truly groundbreaking discovery.\nExact shipping will be calculated and charged after the campaign closes.

Project Astrala began as just a dream, I was tired of seeing overpriced off the shelf bluetooth speakers that catered toward looking fancy and cool instead of focusing on the sound quality. Early 2020 I was able to see my dream begin its steps to infancy as I was able to purchase my first 3d printer, mind you i had no idea at the time on how to effectively manage and use a 3d printer, let alone create a 3d file. So my information journey began. I spent weeks researching as much as i could on 3d printers until finally I felt comfortable enough to try to 3d print a file I had found on Thingiverse, now being the slight nerd that I am, my first 3d print was the Pokemon Lapras. After that successful 3d print I went on to finding more things I wanted to 3d print, but after a time I decided I wanted to try my hand at designing my own 3d files. That is is when I remembered about the off the shelf bluetooth speaker issue I had. So after tons of more research I jumped into designing my own bluetooth speaker, and being as I had already had a background in home and car audio I already had a leg up on where I wanted to go with my idea. So after several trial and errors and wasted filament I finally had what I had dreamed of, and Project Astrala was born. Now enough backstory lets get on to what you really came here for. Project Astrala is a 3d printed Hifi bluetooth speaker that utilizes a quarter wave transmission line enclosure for dual 2\" full range drivers being pushed by a 10w stereo Bluetooth BT 5.0 amp board powered by 3.7v lithium ion battery. Along with a few cosmetic options. But the primary focus is on the sound quality, Project Astrala produces crystal clear, clean audio and can reproduce some lower end bass frequencies that normally would not be heard in a 2\" full range driver, thanks to the enclosure style. Now after writing out a full blown essay, I would like to thank you for your future support and for the fact you took the time to read all of this.\nSincerly, Lantz Jones", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBudgeting and resource requisition may be the most difficult part, but i plan on buying in bulk as much as possible to avoid having to reorder and run the risk of out of stock items, and that will also assist in the budget since I can save by ordering bulk and making use of sales.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSomething else\nI will be using PLA filament for the 3d printing process which is bio-degradable, made from renewable resources, is carbon neutral and can be mechanically recycled.", "creator_bio": "Lantz Jones\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nI am 26 years old and wanted to design create my own line of products.See more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Project Recognition", "descp": "You will be recognized in the Thank You page, on my Store site, as a contributer toward Project Astrala.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "STL File", "descp": "You will receive the STL file to 3d print your own Project Astral Bluetooth speaker enclosure.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}], "stat": ["2 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 55 or more", "title": "Base Model Project Astrala", "descp": "You will receive a Base Model Astrala Bluetooth speaker.

Thanks for your support in 2019, you helped us make our first project into ture, and it\u2019s in mass production and become one of most popular affordable resin 3d printers in market. With thousands of reviewing and feedback from uers in community, the next generation 3d printer is bringing out.\n\nThe majority of LCD 3D printers in market are built in 5.5\u201d 2K resolution of LCD screen, and the converntional pixel size of screen is 47.25um, is there any way to get a higher precision solution? If upgrade the 2K LCD screen to higher resolution for 4K, the pixel size will be driven down to 31.5um. Furthermore, if a pixel can be divided into 3 subpixels, the resolution in one direction will be as fine as 10.5um, which is a dramatic improvement over the 2K LCD screen.\nWith the algorithm embedded in Longerware, the UV exposure through each subpixel will be controlled accurately to deliver final 3D models with ultra-smooth surfaces and ultra-fine details.\nOrange 4K is born!\nOrange 4K is improved with one stand cover, built by metal body and dual liner guide, which is more stable and reliable. And it\u2019s integrated with 2.8\u201d touch screen, plastic resin vat with scale and simple levelling declined built plate.\nThe printed volume of Orange 4K is 118*66*190mm(4.64\u201d*2.6\u201d*7.48\u201d). Orange 4K is equipped with 5.5\u201d lcd screen, and there\u2019re color & mono screen in configuration, reaching at 4K resolution 812 PPI. When configurated with color screen, one pixel in XY direction is 31.5um; while update with mono screen, one pixel of X direction is 31.5um, but Y direction has driven down to 10.5um. Moreover, The LCD screen has been improved on manufacturing procedure, and coated with galss cover over the screen, which will be better on protection. \nOrange 4K will be compatible with LongerWare, Chitubox & Lychee slicer, and we will setup the default printing parameter for color screen and monochrome screen. It will be much easier for user to select and configurate the printing parameter. \nOrange 4K Color 3d printer is able to upgrade to mono screen as well, but need to update the firmware. When Orange 4K is configurated with mono screen, the printing speed is up to 2s per layer, which will be increasing by 300% to reach at 60mm/h. \nPLAY\n\nThanks 3DArtGuy designed of Archagnel with Diorama, this character miniature printed by Orange 4K Color was got an amazing quality. \nPLAY\n\n Please reach our update #1 to figure out 4K Color & 4K Mono Printer difference. \n Why Kickstarter? \nLonger has our own R&D team and has the design ability for hardware, firmware embedded, mechanical, and slicer development.  With months development and testing by our R&D team, the prototype of Orange 4K finally passed the test and printed with high qualified result. \n\nLaunching on Kickstarter is building the bridge between initial users and Longer, and we hope we will get more feedback from customers and even make more improvement before this printer push into market. The voices from initial users are important to us.\n Longer 3D was established in 2014 but started with 3d printing material and industrial 3d printers. With years development on R&D, we have accumulated our own hardware designed ability, software and slicing algorithm on 3d printers and got 50 patents on 3d printing. We launched consumer 3d printers in 2018 and built with our own factory, then marketing with LONGER brand since 2019. Now we have established 10+ foreign warehouses, two fixing centers in US and three fixing service in Euro to provide better support service for customers. We keep the ultimate pursuit with our value: With Longer, Make it Better, to provide better quality and more affordable 3d printers for customers.

With our mature supply chain and according with quality control policy of our own factory, we are confident that this new product will be delivered as planned; because we are not only for Kickstarter campaign, but for the market of resin 3d printers.\n\nHowever, we still need to face some challenges and unexpected exception occurred during this project. For sure we will resolve the problems finally and keep the promised we made because we have the ability of hardware design, decoding on programming and slice software development of our R&D department.

A little too late? Well, better luck next turn.\nThe game never stops surprising you, as every player plays it a bit different. So many strategies, so many variables, and a single choice that will decide if you get to win the treasure, or see it hauled away to a foe's ship.\nEach round, players fight each other for one of the many different magical treasures. During one's turn, the player has two choices: either play a card with a symbol of the treasure of the round, or skip the turn, waiting for better opportunities, or simply missing the necessary card to play. Players take turns clockwise, deciding on the best strategy to win the treasure. Once a player holds a treasure for an entire turn, he gets to take it back to his ship and gains its special effect. The game is over, once a player collects 4 different treasures.\nThe best part of the game is when you feel like a mastermind, like you've outsmarted all of your friends.  While everyone was fighting for the treasure, you were waiting for the perfect moment to strike. Just when one of your friends was about to take the treasure back to his ship, you laugh at his face and curb his expectations, by taking the treasure into your own hands. You feel ecstatic, you are about to win the game. And just at the moment when you think that you had it in the bag...

You don't always have to draw a battle map. Sometimes a small picture is enough to quickly show what the situation around the players looks like. Or did you ever try to come up with a dungeon room on the fly and just could not come up with an interesting layout? This deck of dungeon cards is perfect for those situations. 36 (now 54) unique cards full of stairs, dark corners, slim corridors, claustrophobic rooms, crates, barrels and much more to place monsters and treasure in.\nCards can be either used separately or combined to form larger dungeons. You can reveal one card after another as your players make their way through the dungeon and make them curious about each corner.\nThe cards are made out of professional 310gsm card stock with a blue core and smooth linen finish for the professional look & feel. The deck comes in a custom printed tuck box with a protective matte coating to give your cards the home they deserve. \nSpeaking of... Each map (as well as the back of the card and the box) is completely hand-drawn. All 36 cards are already done and just need to be sent off to the printer.\nSo why Kickstarter?

It doesn't matter if for the physical deck or the PDF version. If we reach 300 backers the deal is sealed.

It is a work of art divided into 54 unique and individual pieces that bring an entire universe to life. As in the master\u2019s works, all the corners of these cards hide carefully illustrated details for an impressive composition. Those who back the project will also receive an exclusive 55th card paying tribute to M.C. Escher where Bosch characters go up and down his impossible staircase, thus combining the style of both masters.\nClose to one and a half years in the making, this is the one deck that I am most proud of.  Whether you are a playing card collector or a  puzzle lover or an art collector, this 100% custom deck has got something for each one of you. These art playing cards are my passion, but they'll never become a reality without your support. Won't you join me while we explore the world of Hieronymus Bosch?\nBosch Puzzle Playing Cards- Collector's Edition\nFEATURES:\nA transformation* deck of Playing Cards - basically the \"Iron Man\" of custom playing card design\n54 piece Polyptych magical Puzzle \nEach card is a self-contained picture, but laying the cards out in a specific sequence transforms the entire deck into a single large artwork masterpiece. \nA Kickstarter exclusive 55th card that is the world's first masterpiece combining M.C. Escher's work with Hieronymus Bosch - Only available to backers of this project & this special card won't be available in the leftover decks, so you won't like to miss it. \nReaching the funding goal will ensure a print run of 1000 decks. \nPrinted by Legends Playing Card Company on Classic Finish with Performance Coating\nElegant tuckbox with strategic embossing  done on the artwork & matte soft touch stock\n Numbered seal on every deck. Check the update#8 for more. Handnumbering the tucks is also being considered as an option. \nPoker sized (3.5\" X 2.5\") & traditional cut\n Augmented Reality (AR) experience available (on Apple & Android devices)\nGet this Collector's Edition deck at a discounted rate when you pledge on Kickstarter\nShipping & Fulfillment by Gamblers Warehouse, Texas, USA who are the leaders in Kickstarter fulfillment\n *A transformation playing card (sometimes referred to as a transformation deck when assembled into a complete set) is a type of playing card where an artist incorporates the pips of the non-face cards into an artistic design. \n\n\n\nA pic from the Prototype deck\nThe unreality of living in a COVID-19 world, an unprecedented experience that contradicts the reality we have known, is like living in a Bosch painting ... Particularly relevant today, however, are the people encapsulated in bubbles, remindful that we now live lockdown indoors, and outdoors with faces masked.- David Lenefsky, law.com\nAugmented Reality \nThe cards offer an Augmented Reality (AR) feature that will transport you back to the 15th Century artwork of Hieronymus Bosch. App available on both Apple & Android devices. See the demo below to know more:\n\nThe Inspiration\nAll of Hieronymus Bosch's seminal works were closely studied and explored for hundreds of hours. Bosch Playing Cards is a 100% original work of art that combines a number of Bosch's works in an entirely original manner.  This makes it a unique and art masterpiece, which is now available to all Kickstarter backers.\nThe Garden of Earthly Delights\nThe Temptation of St. Anthony\nThe Last Judgment\nShip of Fools\n\nPuzzle & the Art\nThe polyptych puzzle playing cards is an ode to the legacy of Hieronymus Bosch.  Each card is an individual piece of art while placing the 54 cards together transforms these individual parts into a single larger masterpiece. \nThe cards combine the essence of a transformation deck, in which the suits interact in the scene as elements integrated into it, with the nature of a puzzle deck, in which the dynamism of the characters is accentuated by their connection with those depicted in the other cards they are connected to. The Bosch deck is not only a deck of fine art playing cards, but it is a magical puzzle too. When placed together in the right sequence, the entire deck of 54 cards transforms itself into a single bigger masterpiece. A perfect gift for family gatherings & parties, I've even used it as a challenge to solve while in isolation during these COVID days. \nAre you ready to solve it in record time?  Check the online demo of the puzzle @ tabletopia here:  https://tabletopia.com/games/bosch-puzzle\nPolyptych Puzzle incorporates 54 cards in a specific sequence to form a bigger masterpiece\nLet pictures do the talking now.\n\nThe 55th card is a Kickstarter exclusive, available only to backers of this project.  The illustration on this card is inspired by one of the most renowned works by MC Escher, the Escherian Stairwell, but adds Hieronymus Bosch's special touch to it, thus making it an ode to both masters. Just as Escher reproduced one of Bosch's works in 1935, so the completely original artwork on this extra 55th card is an attempt to reproduce one of Escher's prolific works, through the lens of Bosch. Only available as the 55th card to the backers of this Kickstarter project. \nKickstarter exclusive 55th Card - A tribute to M.C. Escher and Hieronymus Bosch\nKickstarter exclusive 55th card (enlarged) - Inspired by M.C. Escher and Hieronymus Bosch\nCard back\nFine art tuckbox with matte finish and strategic placed embossed artwork\nTuckbox layout with embossed artwork in blue\n I spent hundreds of hours studying Bosch's paintings, and this helped me observe many small details in his work.  The following snapshots showcase some of those hidden details, which you will find reproduced in a completely original manner in this unique deck of cards.\nSmall details in Garden of Earthly Delights\n\nADD-ONS\n\nPlease check the following article on how to change your pledge amount to include add-ons.  https://help.kickstarter.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005126814-How-can-I-change-my-pledge-amount  Still have questions? --> guruplayingcards@gmail.com\nBosch Mini deck\nMini deck sized 44mm X 63 mm (approx. half of poker sized deck)\n54 cards (52 + 2 jokers)\nLinen Finish & printed by WJPC\nTuckbox with matte finish.

These authentic limited editions uncut sheets of playing cards will be pulled straight off the factory press. They will arrive ready to be framed on your wall and will be safely shipped in a sturdy round tube. To add uncut sheets to your pledge, increase your pledge by USD $44 (shipping included).\nWhen initial renderings of the Bosch deck were shared, a backer of one of my previous Kickstarter projects posted comments along these lines: \"This is the one painter that I would LOVE to own an original painting from!! Alas, so few known examples of his work exist, that I would have to have the money of a Russian oligarch IF one would ever come up for sale!  So instead I will have to settle for this great looking deck of cards!\"\nThe uncut sheet will have 54 cards (and not the Kickstarter exclusive 55th card) due to the special print layout required for the uncut sheet. \nMockup of the uncut sheet\nTo add uncut sheets to your pledge, increase your pledge by USD $44 (shipping included).\nFine Art Archival Prints\nIntroducing the museum grade archival prints....A conversation starter....\nUsing Archival pigment ink system & museum grade paper (315 GSM acid free paper)\nAfter experimenting with glossy poster paper, linen canvas, poly-cotton canvas, and archival quality paper, I'm going with the archival quality museum-grade paper to produce one of the finest art prints available on Kickstarter. The minimum print run required at the printer is 10, and I will be taking the total number pledged on Kickstarter (and during the survey process) to keep the number limited. \nPlease message me once you've added either or both the art prints. First come first serve. Note that international shipping is high for shipping a large poster. I didn't notice that while putting the uncut sheet, but glad that GW called it out when I enquired about the updated shipping quote with them.  This is the reason for the price difference between International & US backers.\nBosch Archival Print\nBosch Archival Print\nPrinted on museum grade Archival quality paper\nSize: 61.4 cm X 57 cm\nThese will be shipped unframed in a  heavy-duty shipping tube via USPS\nTo add Bosch Archival Print to your pledge, increase your pledge by USD $90 (for US-based backers) & by USD $110 (for International backers)\nComes with a small GPCC logo and a digital signature\nBoEscherian Stairwell Archival Print\nA masterpiece that combines the works of two masters: Hieronymus Bosch and M.C.

(LPCC), and printed in Taiwan with their Classic Finish.  This is a softer and slicker paper, comparable in feel and handling to a Bicycle deck, but with a more durable card-stock.  USPCC is unable to print this deck with the given requirements, and LPCC is one of the few printers who can print this deck of the cards with the given layout for the uncut sheet layout, along with the full bleed artwork.\n\nSHIPPING\nEverything ships from the USA & I will be using the services of Gamblers Warehouse in Texas.  Shipping is automatically applied when you choose any reward tier and specify your country. You do not need to add anything extra. Avail discounted shipping prices when you pledge for any reward.  \nUSA backers - Free Shipping when you choose reward tiers of 6+ decks\nInternational backers - Only $10 USD when you choose a reward tier of 1-5 decks\nThis is cheaper than the actual postage fees, so I'll pay the rest out of my own pocket to help you get Bosch in your hands. \nGiven GW's expertise in fulfillment & shipping, I expect the fulfillment experience to be smooth similar to my past projects. The decks will be shipped from Legends factory in Taiwan to the USA and I am also absorbing some of those costs to get you an awesome deal when you back this deck on Kickstarter. That said, COVID has caused some disruption of shipping lines and I will be informing backers throughout the course of the project if any delay in shipping & fulfillment arises. \n\n WHY PURCHASE ON KICKSTARTER? \nFunding is really critical for all independent creators like me. Join me to help push the playing card world forward. Transformation and such art decks are a rarity these days. \nThe Collector's Edition has the Kickstarter exclusive 55th card that will be only available to the backers of this project and won't be there in the leftover decks. Once they're gone, they're gone! \nThe addition of a free micro deck is also unprecedented and available to the backers for free and only for the first 48 hours of this campaign. \n Unique discount, only for KS. Save money now by supporting the project. My previously produced decks are usually sold on Ebay at 5x-7x the price on Kickstarter. As an example, each card of A Motley Pack Transformation deck is sold for $24 each per card on Ebay. A few limited edition decks are not available anywhere. \nAll discounted Kickstarter prices will be increased in retail stores once the project is over, which means Kickstarter is the only place you can get them first and at this price. The leftover decks will only have 54 cards, so you won't get the Kickstarter Exclusive card from the world of Escher & Bosch elsewhere except on eBay where you might find this deck at a highly inflated price. \nHelp us spread the word via the \u201cShare this project\u201d button above.

Think of Kickstarter as a place where you can help support a project like this and in return you are offered a series of rewards depending on your pledge. Once you've chosen what type of reward you would like to receive, Kickstarter will ask you to register in order to record your pledge. They will safely set up your payment but you will ONLY be billed at the end of the campaign IF this project reaches its funding goal. Remember, if the project isn't fully funded during our Kickstarter campaign, you won't be charged a dime (and, unfortunately, the decks won't be published). You can always go back and change or cancel your reward level before the campaign ends. You can check more info about it here.\nWith the funding goal achieved, I will be able to take the idea to production and get this beautifully crafted deck across to all of you out there. Let's make this project become a reality, and turn this into a published deck! Thank you!\nABOUT GPCC\nThe vision we have at GPCC is to pay tribute to the great artistic works of the past.  \nMy name is Sunish Chabba, and along with my friend & illustrator Ishan Trivedi, I am proud to introduce you to  \"Bosch Playing Cards- Collector's Edition\".\nGuru Playing Card Company (aka GPCC) has already produced 7 successful kickstarter projects to date.  We have the unique accomplishment of having delivered premium quality products to backers across 25 countries, with the shortest lead time, all the while maintaining great communication with our backers at every phase of the Kickstarter campaign from to production to fulfillment.  I stand behind the production and delivery of the products shown above, and I am sure you will be delighted with the outcome. \nYou can read more about GPCC here: Brand Spotlight: Guru Playing Card Company \n In my life outside of GPCC, I work on digital projects.  But it means so much to have a tangible and crafted item in your hands to marvel at, and my goal in GPCC is to create exactly this kind of unique item for you.\nKEEP IN TOUCH\nGuru Playing Card Company on Instagram\nGuru Playing Card Company Website\nTHANKS\nHeartfelt thanks to United Cardists forum, BoardGameGeek reviewer EndersGame, Fes, Max Saiz, Colin Brady, Will Roya (playingcarddecks.com) & Lawrence Sullivan for their constant support & feedback. To Reetika without whose encouragement, this won't have been possible. To my previous Kickstarter backers who used to message me since 2019 on when will this be completed. \nSpecial thanks to Montenzi for his quick response to my questions. He is always willing and open to share both information & knowledge, a real asset to the design world. Thanks to Ben Jones from Elephant Playing Cards, because the Bosch deck started as an entirely different concept, but in the end became a polyptych puzzle. Ben had produced his Pipmen World deck a few years back, and as the Bosch deck is another polyptych puzzle-based deck of playing cards, a special thanks is due to him, since I took some inspiration from Ben's Pipmen World project for the mockups.\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've successfully produced & fulfilled 7 projects on Kickstarter. All of these were delivered to backers way earlier than the estimated date & I am proud to say that my projects on Kickstarter have got one of the shortest lead times in this as well as the whole Games category as such on Kickstarter. This coupled with frequent communication through updates ensure that you as backers are on the journey towards making the project a reality. I'm confident that this project will be able to meet and/or exceed the expectations from backers similar to my past projects.\n\nIf there are any speed bumps during production, I will do my very best to communicate with you about what is going on and how I plan to resolve any issues. Risk mitigation while maintaining constant communication with the backers will be my strategy for this project as well. COVID-19 is the biggest risk for the printing, shipping and delivery section of this process, and therefore I have put a much later delivery date than I actually anticipate.

This deck was also aimed to have well-known court cards, the interesting main character, and featured figures from classical antiquity, taken from sources such as Greek and Roman plays, as well as the Bible, which adds another historical value to its rarity.  \nOriginal illustrations were fiddling artworks - manually stipple engraved & etched on copper plates\n\"Numbered\" Limited Edition Displayed (Whole Metallic Gold-Inked Tuck)\nThere are many historical values in the series of decks! But if you are only interested in the deck details & images instead of history & backstory with additional description on the theme individually to each deck, then please skip about halfway down.\nCharming beginning of \"Karten Almanach\" series\nThe story behind these playing cards, which probably conceal most of the world's playing card secrets, begins in T\u00fcbingen, a city in southwest Germany. \nThe idea behind the concept of Cotta's transformation decks was to create a series of six decks on an annual basis from 1805-1811. Each deck would focus on a different theme, with the second set based on Racine's plays such as Andromache (1667), Britannicus (1669), Iphig\u00e9nie (1674), and Esther (1689), which featured figures from the history of classical antiquity, Greek and Roman mythology, Bible, ...\nForming a \"Card Almanac\" (Karten Almanach), each card in the deck would represent one of the 52 weeks in a calendar year. At the time it was popular to print various almanacs, which were special pocketbooks for the new year, and often included a short poem or quote for each week of the calendar year. It was a logical move to connect each of these 52 weeks with playing cards.\n The famous Cotta's publishing house... \nJohann Friedrich Cotta\nThe friendship that gave birth to the idea of Cotta's transformation playing card almanac decks... \nUnexplained stories, hidden mysteries, secrets...\n\"Numbered\" Limited Edition Displayed (Whole Metallic Gold-Inked Tuck)\nIt is especially significant for the way it displays meaningful and inspirational happenings from the time; in this second deck, the theme may reflect something of the religious climate of the day, also with assumed depictions from the life of noble families, etc...\nJean-Baptiste Racine (*December 22, 1639 - April 21, 1699)\nSecond almanac deck: \"Andromache\" (Year 1806) \nThe images on the court cards are the \"Greek and Roman mythology\" characters mostly centered around the Trojan war and inspired by Jean Racine's plays such as Iphig\u00e9nie, Esther, Britannicus and the \"Andromaque\" (\"Andromache\") which was first time performed on 17 November 1667 before the court of Louis XIV in the Louvre in the private chambers of the Queen, Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, by the royal company of actors, called \"Les Grands Com\u00e9diens\", with Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Du Parc in the title role. Andromaque, as the third of Racine's plays, written at the age of 27, established its author's reputation as one of the great playwrights in France. \n*(We technically named this almanac deck the \"Andromache\" in its title for the main character \"Andromaque\" depicted as Queen of Spades, same as Joan of Arc was placed there on the Queen of Spades card in previous blue Cotta's deck themed on Joan.)\nAround the time of Cotta's playing cards being produced, lots of creative people have found inspiration in Racine's playwrights. The composer Andr\u00e9 Gr\u00e9try wrote a three-act opera, Andromaque, with a libretto based on the Racine play, which premiered in 1780. In addition, Rossini's two-act 1819 opera, Ermione, is based on Racine's play too.\n\"Numbered\" Limited Edition Displayed (Whole Metallic Gold-Inked Tuck)\nThe central figure of Andromaque is depicted as the Queen of Spades, she is the wife of the Trojan military hero Hector, daughter of Eetion, and sister to Podes and six other brothers; her name Andromache represents \"courage\" and has a meaning of \"man fighter\". (And so she might be the most interesting \"main\" character of the second Cotta's almanac deck.)\nAndromache was taken from her father's household by Hector and they together fit the Greek ideal of a happy and productive marriage, which heightens the tragedy of their shared misfortune. Andromache portrayed the role of perfect wife and mother who, a full year after the destruction of Troy, fulfills the fate of conquered Trojan women in ancient warfare as a widow held in captivity with her young son by Pyrrhus in Epirus, and later a distressed mother who despairs at the murder of her son Astyanax... \nFeatures:\nPrinted by USPCC on Classic Stock\nPoker Size\nEmbossed Finish\n52 Cards + 2 Extra Jokers + 2 Extra Collectible Cards\nMetallic Ink On Box & Backs\nCustom Seals - Numbered and Standard \nPuzzle Image on all Tuck Spines of the Series\nDigitally Hand-Recreated and Designed by Azured Ox\nProduced By Will Roya\nCotta's second deck was, as well as the first deck, designed by Countess Mary Day von Jennison-Walworth (sometimes spelled with a single 'n'). Her maiden name was Beauclerk, and she was the wife of Count Francis Jenison Walworth (1764\u20131824). She was an illegitimate (twin) child who led a very colorful life and finally settled down somewhat after marrying Count Francis in 1797. (Probably, she was creating illustrations in Stuttgart.)\n2 Limited Editions\nAfter the success of the first blue Cotta's almanac deck, to meet your demand, now we come with two versions of second green Cotta's deck limited edition - the \"Numbered\" and the \"Standard\". As a campaign before, we are limiting this 2nd \"Numbered\" deck to only 1,000 copies of tuck which is the whole gold-inked with custom numbered seals. Additional \"Standard\" limited edition decks are created just with a slight difference on tuck designed with dark and gold ink combination and the same custom seals (non-numbered).\nThe design of both versions of Cotta's limited edition tuck boxes, the standard and the numbered, created by Azured Ox, have been inspired by the old books and published writers work using the gold ink on their covers as well as combined with the dark ink.\nWith the Elements of Heraldic Achievement...\nIncludes heraldry symbols connected with the family and past of the noble designer countess Jenison von Walworth who created the most of the Cotta's decks...\nThe entire 6 deck series is in many ways designed by Azured Ox to meet collector's demand (as \"collection of historical books\") and will be produced with the piece of puzzle image on each tuck spine (left side of the box) to create together a nice display of the Tuebingen monument surroundings, where the idea for Cotta's decks was born.\nSpine Puzzle Image of \"Numbered\" Limited Edition Displayed (Whole Metallic Gold-Inked Tuck) *Puzzle Image of \"Standard\" Limited Edition is Dark-Inked\n *(These are just \"Digital Demonstrations\" to present ink combinations of both editions)\n*Puzzle Image of \"Standard\" Limited Edition Displayed (Combined Metallic Gold + Dark Inked Tuck)\n\"Numbered\" Limited Edition Displayed (Whole Metallic Gold-Inked Tuck)\nSix Unique Different Card Back Patterns Designed, with Regard to Card Handling, Individually for Each of the Cotta's Deck Year Almanacs.\nClassic Style Borderless Full-Bleed Card Back Design with Luxury Feeling and Metallic Ink\nThe Same Gold Metallic Ink Card Back Design for Both Editions of the Cotta's Deck\nThe publisher's name was placed on the Ace of Clubs as follows: \"A Tubinge chez J. G. Cotta, Libraire.\"\nThe transformations on the number cards have no reference to each other or to the court cards (as well lots of them might be considered as an unexplained mystery).\nClassical, Historical, Mythological, Biblical...\nThe court cards were designated with the words \"Valet\", \"Dame\", and \"Roi\", which are the French terms corresponding to the Jack, Queen, and King.\nThere is evidence of T\u00fcbingen having a Jewish community in its past (e.g. the Middle Ages), but since catholic reforms were being enacted when this deck was being produced, this also may have been a motive for choosing illustrations that depicted classical and historical heroes and heroines mostly from Greek mythology, as well as the major roles from tragedies by French playwriter and dramatist Jean Racine, such as Andromaque, Iphig\u00e9nie, Esther, and Britannicus.\nAhasuerus (King of Spades) is the Biblical name for Xerxes, the King of Persia who died in 465 BC. Other Biblical characters include Esther (Queen of Clubs), Xerxes' wife and Jewish heroine who rescued her nation from the evil Haman; and her uncle Mordecai (Jack of Hearts). Agrippina the Younger (Queen of Diamonds) was Nero's mother, while Sextus Afranius Burrus (Jack of Spades) was a Praetorian prefect, whom Agrippina helped to his position under Claudius and Nero.\nMythical characters include Andromache (Queen of Spades), the wife of Hector of Troy, described in the famous Iliad; Ulysses (King of Hearts), the Greek leader and hero from the Odyssey; Agamemnon (King of Diamonds), leader of the Greeks in the Trojan War; Iphigenia (Queen of Hearts), Agamemnon and Clytemnestra's daughter; Orestes (Jack of Diamonds), their son who kills his mother and her lover for murdering his father; Pyrrhus (King of Clubs), son of Achilles, who is put to death by Orestes; and Arcas (Jack of Clubs), son of Jupiter and Kalisto, who was a servant to Agamemnon.\nBurrhus, tutor of Nero the Emperor, Agrippina was Nero's mother and she helped Burrhus on his position; \nAndromache, the wife of the Trojan military hero Hector, daughter of Eetion, and sister to Podes and six other brothers, she was held in captivity by Pyrrhus; \nAhasuerus, King of Persia\n Mordecai, Uncle to Esther\nIn Greek mythology, Iphigenia was a daughter of King Agamemnon and Queen Clytemnestra, (and so sister of Orestes), and thus a princess of Mycenae.\nOdysseus, Greek hero also known by the Latin variant Ulysses\nArcas, servant to Agamemnon\nEsther (Queen of Persia) is described in all versions of the biblical Book of Esther as the Jewish queen of a Persian king Ahasuerus. In the narrative, Ahasuerus seeks a new wife after his queen, Vashti refuses to obey him, and Esther is chosen for her beauty. \nNeoptolemus, also called Pyrrhus, was the son of the warrior Achilles and the princess Deidamia in Greek mythology, and also the mythical progenitor of the ruling dynasty of the Molossians of ancient Epirus.\nOrestes was the son of Clytemnestra and Agamemnon, (and so the brother of Iphigenia). He is the subject of several Ancient Greek plays and of various myths connected with his madness and purification, which retain obscure threads of much older ones. \nAgrippina, widow of Domitius Enobarbus father of Nero, & from the second marriage, widow of Emperor Claudius\nIn Greek mythology, Agamemnon was a king of Mycenae, the son, or grandson, of King Atreus and Queen Aerope of Mycenae, the brother of Menelaus, the husband of Clytemnestra and the father of Iphigenia, Electra or Laodike, Orestes and Chrysothemis. Legends make him the king of Mycenae or Argos, thought to be different names for the same area. When Menelaus's wife, Helen, was taken to Troy by Paris, Agamemnon commanded the united Greek armed forces in the ensuing Trojan War.\nAt last, we came with an idea to reflect the opposite of noble life and to bring closer to you even more of the unique artistic history placed on extra collectible playing cards...\nAlso, we thought it could be interesting to put other illustrations from the far past on the additional extra cards, in respect to year almanacs, we came with an idea of twelve calendar months in the series as an exclusive collection of unique historical artworks...\n An absolutely original playing card masterpiece to hang on your wall (double-sided)\nWith help from you the backers we plan to produce the entire 6 deck series! The color of each tuck box created by Azured Ox has been inspired by Goethe's experimental optic and color theory, since Goethe was an important contemporary of Cotta, along with Schiller. (Goethe's deepest immersion into colors was during Cotta's decks issuing.)\n\"Numbered\" Limited Edition\n\"Standard\" Limited Edition (Non-Numbered)\nAdd-Ons will be based on availability and will be announced after the campaign.

Thank you very much for your interest in the project\nZOMBIE APOCALYPSE is my third Kickstarter, this project consists of a set of zombie-themed characters and terrains.\nFor only \u20ac 18 (65 for commercial license), you would have:\nPACK ALL IN + STREACH GOALS + SPECIAL STREACH GOALS\nAll of this means 45 miniatures (including terrain pieces) and a diorama.\n The city is infested with zombies and monsters, work to survive this pitched battle. Unfortunately, the number of zombies is much greater than the number of survivors.\nYou will receive the digital files. These models are ideal for resin printers, but also suitable for FDM printers.\nThese characters can be used in wargame games or to make your own made-up campaigns.\nAll the characters have been modeled with the 3D modeling program Zbrush, I have been a digital modeler for 2 years, I had previously made collectible figures, you can see my previous works in the artstation link below.\nhttps://www.artstation.com/ismaelpanaderogarcia\nThis kickstarter focuses on creating a world and characters inspired by the zombie theme, creative and memorable adventures that we can now produce in our fantasy role-playing games and board games.\nIf you love printing and collecting 3D printable figures and miniatures as much as I love sculpting them, this Kickstarter is definitely for you. With your support, we can unlock more and more figures and new stages.\nThe figures can be printed 1)complete with the base and 2)the base and the figure separated, for the more complex figures, it can also be printed in parts (you can see the example photo)\nWhat will you receive?\nEach figure has been exported as a high quality STL file. Also, you will have two options when printing each character, since the file will include a solid piece and other cut pieces, so you can print the whole character, or print it in pieces, the files are 100% scalable. The stl file of each character will be sent in two different sizes, 32mm, 54mm, as you can see in the photograph.\nProducts will be delivered 20 days after the end of the Kickstarter.\nTo show the expected level of detail, below is a sample gallery of prints made.\nHere are the elastic targets for this campaign.

The original campaign can be viewed here - https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/epicsnstuffs/the-dwarves\nEpics 'N' Stuffs is a DnD driven miniature patreon which creates a range of sculpts from varying parts of the lore with their own unique style.\nWe've had many requests for late pledges and merchant tiers, the original campaign also went beyond the final deliverables of 49 Models (including the base Dwarves and Stretch goals). This campaign will deliver those original assets committed plus additional variants/models as well as a Merchant tier facility. That's a lot of fully supported Dwarf models in 2 size variants.  ***This is a digital only Campaign***\nThe Assets in this bundle won't be offered again at this insane price so get it whilst you can!!!\n A BIG THANKS!!!\nWe'd also like to thank everyone in advance of their support, especially those who backed our original Dwarf campaign and our patrons over @ Epics 'N' Stuffs Patreon. Thanks to your support, and that of Kickstarter we've been able to offer the Dwarves from the original campaign PLUS MORE! to new people within the community. Thanks again, it means a lot.\nAny Questions?\nIf you have any questions please refer to the FAQs at the bottom of the campaign page or alternatively DM us directly or email us over at epicsnstuffs@gmail.com\nA couple of FREE .STL file's are available here to test print for yourself, it also includes a Chitubox file if you happen to be printing on a resin unit. \n Toilet Paper Merchant - https://ln2.sync.com/dl/ab7ff7910/vy34g96p-fb7i98jv-93ahy2dk-hvpyp9z3\n Dwarven Rogue Variant 6 - https://ln2.sync.com/dl/73ebbe1b0/i3qirygq-5nvjfih7-ghj47jne-vmuj5sb2\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHere are the renders for each Dwarf and some images of print results .\nBackers will receive the chitubox project files which contain the models hollowed and supported, the same files I used to print the models below. So if you have a resin machine such as the Elegoo Mars, Epax X1, Anycubic Photon etc... these files will just need slicing and should be ready to go :)\n Prints shown were made using an Elegoo Mars or Elegoo Mars Pro.\n\nAdditional variants for this campaign!\nPATREON X KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE!\nIf you're a patreon backer over @ Epics 'N' Stuffs Patreon and happen to back either of the Dwarves Kickstarter campaigns you'll also get an additional model, the Dwarven Bannerman. All you need to do is either DM us or email us over at epicsnstuffs@gmail.com with your Kickstarter name and patron name/email. Once the campaign is over and everything has been processed/uploaded we'll send send you a direct link to the specific model. \nUpon a successful campaign/funding, Kickstarter takes 2 to 3 weeks to process pledges. Once that is done we will send everyone a direct message via kickstarter containing links/passwords to the library of assets for the campaign.\nFAQs\nQ, Why're you not offering physical tiers this time around?\nA. There are a few factors, time investment being the main one, printing, prepping, boxing, sending all the models personally was a large 'time-sink'. Also with Covid it introduced consumable shortages and delivery delays which both financially kicked us as well as ate further into the time we could have been using to make the models. It's not to say we won't do another campaign in future with physical assets, just not this time around.\nQ. Are the .STL's game size?\nA. They're provided on 25mm and 32mm bases (some on 40mm and 50mm like the King). These sizes are typically bigger then your normal tabletop, they're a good size to paint and play. You can always scale them in your slicer to your desired size. I typically use this .STL to help with that - https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3649454\nQ. Can you not use 'insert service name here' instead of Sync?\nA. Sync, despite it's flaws, proves to be the most reliable in our experience. We have used Dropbox in the past and ran into a plethora of issues including long outages, and hard daily limits. Sync has no daily download limit and the files will be hosted for an extremely long time. We have delivered these files to over 1000 people with great results. Any issues please ask and we'll aim to help :)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNone really,\nThe assets are all digital in this campaign and have already been delivered to a large number of people.

Secondly, I may have had an issue with your email address (both the one for Kickstarter and the one you supplied in the survey) - if I know about this then I have sent you a message through Kickstarter.

These should have come through to your emails so please check and if there\u2019s a problem let me know. The surveys are there to let me know which email address you would like the game sent to and if you would like the rules in all of the additional languages. When it comes to the email, you will receive you either 3 or 4 attachments : 1) Standard game sheets and rules (2 page pdf) 2) Advanced games sheets and rules (2 page pdf) 3) Kickstarter exclusive game sheets (1 page pdf) 4) Foreign language rules (still being formatted but probably a 2 page pdf) The foreign language rules will all be together so don\u2019t worry about letting me know which language you would like. I have had a couple of questions about the foreign rules so I hope this clears it up for everyone. If it doesn\u2019t or it triggers any more questions please message me so I can try and help!

Your souls have been shattered, and the only way to wake up is to collect Soul Fragments by traversing your nightmares. But watch out, because the Sandman will haunt you trying to consume your remaining Soul Fragments.\nTeam up against the Sandman or turn against each other. If the Sandman is killed, everyone wins. But if one of you wakes up first, they win, while the other players stay trapped in the nightmare forever, left as a feast for the Sandman.\nTry this game of cooperation, conflict, betrayal, and nightmares \nWHAT IS SPECIAL ABOUT SLEEP TIGHT\nSleep Tight is a game with a unique atmosphere and fast and dynamic gameplay. We played a lot of board games, card games and tons of RPGs and wanted to create an easy to learn game that relies on a universal language (uses just symbols and icons for all actions - which are easy to learn). The game is also full of tactics and options and demands a mastering of the possibilities and choices as it can be a game of cooperation, individual play, or backstabbing while you play as the Sandman\u2019s undercover ally.\nEasy to learn and easy to dive in mechanics even for inexperienced players\n  Card use easy to learn and accessible symbols\n  A dynamic, fast, and intense system\n  The game is for 2-4 players\nHOW TO PLAY SLEEP TIGHT\nSleep Tight is a 10-20 minute game that is dynamic and fast-paced in terms of decisions and actions. Sometimes you\u2019re lucky and get a large hand of cards you can choose from, and sometimes you have to micromanage and get the best out of a small hand. It\u2019s a game where your luck can change suddenly when the Sandman lashes out, testing your intuition and skills. Will you hide and wait for the attack to blow over, or will you actively attack and escape by the skin of your teeth?\nIn Sleep Tight you need to constantly be alert and think few steps ahead, as you will need to guess the other players\u2019 next move or even worse, the Sandman\u2019s!\n\n A video of the gameplay can be seen here: \nWHY KICKSTARTING A PRINT TO PLAY VERSION\nThis is a sort of a pre-campaign; we would like to polish the rules to their perfection and what better community to do that than the Kickstarter gaming army? Also, Kickstarter is a good way of spreading the word about the game.

The Royal Navy has their eye on you and the more notorious you become, the more eager they are to stopping your exploits. \nAn encounter with the Navy will surely slow your progress, so you best be avoiding them. To do so, you're going to need a good ship and a great crew!\nThere's a lot of scallywags out there looking for adventure! So assembling your crew won't be very hard, but pulling together a winning crew... that's a different story.\nYour crew will play a major role in Tiny Epic Pirates. Each crew member brings different advantages to battle and to the actions you'll take. \nThe dice listed at the top of each crew card, and your captain's card, represent what number you'll need to roll to score a hit on another ship! Having multiples of a single number can result in lots of damage, but spreading your numbers out can result in more consistent results. The choice is yours!\nThe icons listed at the bottom of each crew card, and your captain's card, represent bonus actions that can chain together for epic turns! If the first icon matches your chosen action, you'll get to take the action of the second icon for free.\nIn addition to your crew, you'll have your reputation and your exploits. As you prove yourself in battle, your legend will grow and so will your ability to command your ship.\nWinning battles against other pirates, and against notable merchants, will increase your Legend Level. Each new level offers immediate benefits, as well as increases to your ship's movement and the number of dice you roll in battle.\nBut enough talk, you're no landlubber.

Players may also lay siege to these Fortresses for additional rewards. But beware, the Floating Fortresses have a contract with the Royal Navy and if any Pirates show their dirty face around there, the Navy will be on their tail!\nEven with the threat of the Navy though, the precious Silver these markets are known for is simply too alluring to avoid. A lot of blood as been spilled over this Silver. So much that it's known around these seas as Crimson Silver.\n***Kickstarter-Limited Exclusivity - Deluxe content will not enter regular distribution.

Cursed gold can be traded for an ancient relic said to hold ashes of Amdiak. Bury this relic and break the Curse of Amdiak!\nIf the ghost ship finds catches you though, your captain becomes cursed and you lose your cursed gold. Once cursed you will be able to recruit powerful skeleton crew to mindlessly obey your wicked command!\nDo you dare to set sail on ghostly waters?\nThe Curse of Amdiak expansion will come in a box of the same thickness and quality of Tiny Epic Pirates.
