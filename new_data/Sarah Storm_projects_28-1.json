[{"backer": "Sarah Storm", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": " (ALL CARDS IN THIS DECK WERE LICENSED FROM THEIR ARTISTS)\nYou walk down the street, busy as ever, when you notice a couple people in the alley you were about to walk by. You see that one man is behind the set up card table, revealing that the ball was under a different cup. The other man cusses and walks off, almost bumping into you. The scam artist looks up at you when you look back at him. He is the Alleyman, and he beckons you inside. For just 17 cents, he will tell you a story about your future with his tarot cards. You begin to say you don't have change on you, but reaching into your pocket you find 17 cents exactly.\nThe Alleyman shuffles his strange and mismatched tarot deck, and begins to tell you a story about someone else that, you come to find is actually about you, as well.\nThe Alleyman's Tarot is a 137 card, mismatched tarot deck. An artifact from the real world, it was made with the kindness of many other artists, part made up of cards licensed from other, real-world tarot decks, part made up of cards I or other artists made for the deck, and part made up of standalone cards from older tarot decks, now public domain. This deck comes with a special guide made specific for the deck, written by the Alleyman himself, explaining the intricacies of the deck and the purpose of its many cards.\nThe Alleyman's will only ever have a single printing, so now is the time to get your copy. A wonderful display deck, certainly, but also the most unique deck to use in your divinatory practice as well.\nTo reach out to me for info on the Alleyman's, our process, help on Kickstarter, press inquiries, wholesale and more, email Seven at SevenThirteenBooks@gmail.com\nFor other things I've made, my patreon, etc, you can find it all here.\nCards with their origin decks\n The Official Facebook Fanpage for the Alleyman's Deck. The Official Discord.\nThe Deck\nWith 133 cards, there is certainly some strangeness to the deck. 9 Deaths, 2 Devils, 2 Suns, a Tower series of 3 cards (the Tower, the House of God, and the Horizon), and non-traditional cards such as the 3 of Books, the Fountain, and others. Each was chosen by the Alleyman because they bring in important new angles to your readings.\nThe deck is 133 cards in a standard tarot size, 2.75\"x4.75\". Cards have their unique, original cardbacks, and some have foil, or edge gilding, or both, and in different colors.\nIT WILL COME IN A BOX. It will be like a matchbox, a sliding out drawer for the deck. I don't have it mocked up yet, apologies! The box will have enough space for the extra cards from the booster packs, so no worries.\nThe first half of the Major Arcana\nThe Nine Deaths\nThe second half of the Major Arcana\nThe Suit of Cups\nThe Suit of Wands\nSuit of Swords\nThe Suit of Disks\nThe Strange Suit\nThe first half of the Second Arcana\nThe second half of the Second Arcana\nThe Final Tarot Card\nThe Book\nThe book itself has been made to feel like it's a notebook, one that the Alleyman has used and stained and filled out himself, and will be 5\"x8\" with a full color interior and a spiral binding. The table of contents at the front will help you find your cards faster, and the notes and extra reading spreads in the back from the Alleyman will help you make particular use of this very unique deck.\nThe Pledge Tiers\n(SHIPPING WILL BE CHARGED ON BACKERKIT, I've been quoted at about $10 US shipping and $15 international by my fulfillment center, so assume about that for a single deck and book package! If you get multiple items, bear in mind the shipping will increase.)\nAlleyman's Tarot + Guide - $45\n(SOLD OUT) Signed Tier - $65\nLimited to 350 copies (for my sake), I will sign the book and inside of the deck box. \n(partially SOLD OUT) Touched by the Alleyman - $100\nLimited to 500 copies, I will sign your book and box as the Alleyman, and doodle on, mess up, maybe burn, and otherwise help bring some of the grime of life to your deck. I always wanted to cut a hole in The Hole card.... This will be a totally unique, stained, loved, and held deck. \nRetailer Tier - $125\nFOR STORES ONLY. This is 5 copies of the deck and guide, you must message me up front to order this tier, let me know about your store! : ) (If you want more than the 5 copies, that will be done for the cheaper price in backerkit, AFTER the Kickstarter is over. For now, just pledge at this tier and sit pretty until the end of the campaign!)\n(SHIPPING WILL BE CHARGED ON BACKERKIT)\nA Cross Spread\nAdd-Ons\nAdditional copy of the Alleyman's Tarot $30\nAdditional copy of the Guide $10\nPrints $8 - The Builder, Death (fire), Fear, Queen of Bombs (hot pink foil), The Final Tarot Card ((These are cards I made for this deck))\nBooster Pack #1 $5 - Each Booster Pack contains 15 additional cards from new artists/decks. Credits and images of Booster Pack #1 will be in the BOOSTER PACK #1 update. Card meanings and credits will also be in the guidebook, or included in a pamphlet that goes with the pack. Still deciding, but it will be included!\nBooster Pack #2 $5 - Same as above, but more mysterious as the cards aren't yet fully sourced. \nBooster Pack #3 $5 - Ditto.\nBLANKS Booster Pack $5 - This features 15 blank front or lightly framed/templated cards with unique backs, for you to paint or draw whatever your heart desires.\nThe Alley Man's Cigars WOODEN BOX $10 - This solid wood box is sized to fit your deck.\nThe Gleaming Alley SATIN BAG $5 - This 7.5\"x7.5\" satin big will fit your deck and cloth.\nThe Alleyway Liqueur TAROT CLOTH $5 - This 24\"x24\" cloth will wrap your deck up in luxury and give you a clear space to read.\nThe Alley's Casino Poker Chip $3 - This poker chip from a non-existent casino is used by the Alleyman as a reminder that fate costs. You never know what it costs when you make deals with it, but it always comes to collect in the end. When doing a reading, the Alleyman sets it on the top of the deck after the first few cards. To go further, the querent needs to pick up the chip and take on the debt. \nThe Alleyman's Coin $3 - If you pledged for a deck, you're already getting a single free coin. This add-on is only if you want an extra. One side has a carved in X, the other a carved in O. \nHANDMADE ADD-ONS\nWalnut Wooden Box $225 - This solid walnut box is sized to fit your deck and boosters, as well as having a unique place to store the coin and pokerchip. Crafted by Cen Galdre of Galdrecraft. Limited to 150.\nPatchwork Foldover Bag $250 - This hand-made bag is hand-sewn and made up of patchwork square fabric bits, perfectly sized for the deck and boosters, with an additional pouch for the coin. You additionally will be able to choose an applique to go on the bag during the survey. Crafted by Alex Kelly. Limited to 50.\nPatchwork Drawstring Bag $25 - This 7.5\"x7.5\" bag will fit your deck, tarot cloth, and trinkets! Each bag is made up of a custom patchworked selection of random fabrics, so no two bags will be alike. There's a neat little hidden pocket for the coin, as well. Crafted by Lady Latham of Lady Latham's Cosplay Closet. Limited to 1,000.\n Take a closer look at the prints! \n See the Booster Pack #1 Cards and Credits here.\nBooster #2.\nBooster #3.\n\nStretch Goals\nSome hopeful goals.\n!! REACHED !! 130,000- This is a personal one!

REACHED !! 150,000- Artist appreciation! Let's divvy up some $100 to each artist!\n!!

Another $100 to each artist!\n!! REACHED !! 300,000- Everyone who is getting at least a deck is getting an Alleyman's Yes/No coin, details of material and design to be determined, AND a 134-th card of my choice, to be determined.\n!! REACHED !! 350,000- Artist appreciation! Another $200 to each artist, and a SECOND Booster Pack add on is included. Same as the first, with new cards.\n!! REACHED !! 400,000- Is this even possible?

Heraldry or the Zodiac? Do you have a birthday?\nIf you answered yes to any of those, read on!\nI\u2019m designing a calendar based on the signs of the Zodiac, which will be re-invented as house sigils or shields \u2014complete with a house motto as in the Game of Thrones series\u2014 and the long tradition of European Heraldry that inspired George R. R. Martin\u2019s family house structures in his books.\n\nThe calendar will consist of 12 rack cards \u20144\u201dx9\u201d, which can be trimmed down to 4\u201dx6\u2019 postcards, suitable for framing or sending at the end of the year. They'll be printed on card stock with a 'silk' finish (very smooth, luxurious matte coating).\nI\u2019ve designed 11 printed calendars over the years, each with its own theme, each in a different format. The last one I designed was in 2010 and it was a lavish 5-month project called the Atlas of Calendria. It was chosen as Editors\u2019 Pick on Etsy and was featured on a number of design, cartography and other blogs, like TopDesign Mag, who included it in their article, \u201cCalendar Design at its Best\u201415 Superb Examples\u201d. It was also featured on the design blog For Print Only. ThisNext called it \u201cjust about the coolest thing ever.\u201d, and Big Think: Strange Maps reported that \u201cat the beginning of this new year, hardly any map could be as appropriate as this one of Calendria, a place made out of time. \u201d\nAs you can see in the video, it was a fold-out map of an imaginary world made up of 12 countries, named (loosely) for the months, each of which had its own coat of arms. Stylistically, it was a sort of melding of a calendar (time) and J. R. R. Tolkien\u2019s world (place).\nThis time it\u2019ll be more along the lines of a mash-up of the Zodiac and George R. R. Martin, inspired by the imagery used for the houses in the Game of Thrones series.\nHere are the first two cards I\u2019ve designed\u2014 Scorpio and Capricorn:\nPROJECT TIMELINE\nThis is a work in progress! As you can see, I have two sigils completed so far, so you can get an idea of the style. The colors aren\u2019t set in stone yet, and I\u2019m also still researching to write the house motto for each, but I will be posting progress throughout the campaign, so you can watch it unfold along with me.\nMy goal is to have the artwork ready to send to the printer by or before the end of October, so everything will ship to me by mid-November, to be prepped for shipping. In order for everything to ship in time for the holidays, I\u2019ll need you, my backers, to fill out the final Kickstarter survey in a timely manner, getting them back to me by late November at the LATEST! (If you are overseas, you'll want to reply even sooner, if shipping in time for the holidays / New Year is important.)\nBelow are the initial shield designs that the house sigils will be situated upon.\nIn case you'd like to see more of my work, to bolster your confidence that this will be a sharp-looking finished product, go to my website and look around.

As far as the motto-writing goes, I\u2019ve been reading many different sources to learn as much as possible about each sign, paying close attention to what's common among various sources. {And of course, discussing traits and tendencies with friends of each sign.

This summer, we will focus on cultivating the theatricality of the piece, with this production serving as a launching point for further development of the characters and story.\nThe money raised during this campaign will be used to create the tightest, most succinct production possible. We believe through paying people their actual worth from the beginning we will create an environment that people will be excited to work in over and over again.  \nLoveness is a poetic dance between the experiential level of human reality - dulled by our fruitless search to complete ourselves through a romantic partner - and an exploration of the deeper, more accurate levels of emotion and the measure of how far we have to go to unlock their truth. Loveness is manifested as the story of Carlyle and Isabelle, who fall for one another. They assume it is love but then must face their true intentions and self-deception.\nThis is muMs' second play.

It will be an interactive museum with fully immersive environments and touch screens that will incorporate old and new footage from actors, filmmakers and NASA astronauts and scientists, and will present both the fact and fiction of sci-fi. This will eventually teach Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) based education in a fun new way to all ages. The museum will include exhibits from: Star Trek, Star Wars, Doctor Who, 2001, Alien, Metropolis, Thunderbirds, Firefly, Babylon 5, Battlestar Galactica, Stargate, Blake's 7, Ghostbusters, Farscape, The Time Machine, Godzilla, X-Men, Avengers, Superman, Planet of the Apes, Back to the Future, Day the Earth Stood Still, V, Batman, Six Million Dollar Man, Bionic Woman, Flash Gordon, Buck Rogers, as well as Fantasy like Lord of the Rings, Labyrinth, Legend, Munsters, Herbie the Love Bug, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Dark Crystal, Game of Thrones, Anime like Akira and Speed Racer, and anything else we can fit within our walls.\nThis Kickstarter is to acquire the funds to develop our 2015 Hollywood Sci Fi Museum, which will be smaller than the future museum, but still significant and unique. This \"concept art\" of the giant Millennium Falcon and Enterprise-D is for our 2018 Hollywood Sci Fi Museum.\nHelping to develop the museum is http://rhetroactive.com/ the creative design firm that was part of the original team behind Star Trek: The Experience at the Las Vegas Hilton, the Despicable Me and Simpson's Springfield attractions at Universal Studios, and The Grammy Museum. Other supporters of New Starship Foundation include Paramount, Gersh, Google, Bentley Systems and Entertainment Earth, as well as numerous Star Trek actors and numerous celebrities who wanted to take a photo in our Enterprise-D Captain's Chair.\nMission Statement: The mission of New Starship Foundation and the Hollywood Science Fiction Museum is to inspire people of all ages and nationalities with an uplifting vision of the future found in science fiction media, art and literature by teaching Real Science through Science Fiction, including technology, ecology, engineering, computers, robotics, math, medicine, space travel and all aspects of filmmaking through fun, interactive exhibits and programs.\nIn addition to displays for: Star Trek, Star Wars, Doctor Who, Firefly, Farscape, Stargate and Battlestar Galactica, featured rooms will include:\nHALL OF SPACESHIPS\nLarge scale interactive models of sci-fi ships.\nHALL OF ROBOTS  \nFamous TV and Film Sci-Fi Robots that will be interactive.\nHALL OF REAL ROBOTS  \nA rotating interactive exhibit of the most advanced real robots in the world.\nHALL OF CARS  \nSci-fi and futuristic cars you can climb inside and learn about, hosted by the people who created them and actors who drove them.\nTHE ART OF SPECIAL EFFECTS and ANIMATION\nA room filled with prosthetics, masks, makeup and animatronic props from the greatest makeup and specific effects artists, with videos and interactive displays.This will also include the art of Stop Motion Animation with props and models by Ray Harryhausen, George Pal and Willis O'Brien.\nIn the same building will be the Starship Restaurant, Gift Shop and a room for rotating exhibits and displays for upcoming films and TV shows.\nThis Kickstarter is to obtain the initial funds to develop our 2015 Hollywood Science Fiction Museum.

Both were created by Paramount in 1998, with some pieces from Star Trek: The Experience from the Las Vegas Hilton. In 2012, through Kickstarter and Indiegogo, we raised roughly 1/4 of the money we needed to restore our Enterprise-D Bridge, so we restored the main chairs and computers and took them on the road to over 22 conventions around the USA, where thousands of people sat in them and took photos for free.\nOnce we have the $82,300 secured to begin development for the museum, our next priority is to complete our Enterprise-D Bridge, rent a warehouse, move it and store it, which will take an additional $170,000. To restore our Star Trek: Original Series Bridge will cost roughly $150,000.\nThis will not only restore them \"cosmetically\" but make both sets better than they ever were using LED lights and original blueprints that will make them more accurate to the TV show.\nFuture museum plans include an exact replica of the Firefly/Serenity cockpit, Alien planet, the interior of the Star Wars Death Star, a full-sized X-Wing, the Millennium Falcon cockpit, an animatronic Cylon and much more!\nNOTE: If you want more than one item, donate for an item then add the additional money to it (polo shirt $40 + $15 for a mug) then send us a note saying what the additional money is for.\n                                                           Museum Shirt $30                           \nWilliam Shatner    Star Trek Original Series Autographed photo 8 x 10\"       $200\n Six Million Dollar Man Bionic 8\" Mego style retro figures FEMBOT and OSCAR GOLDMAN      $20 each\n GHOSTBUSTERS PKE Meter Working Replica Mattel       $100\nMuseum Hat $40                                                                Bracelet $5\n Grocery Tote Bag $20                                                Navy Polo Shirt $40\nFIREFLY SERENITY Opening DAY!

LeVar Burton here. You may know me as Kunta Kinte, from ROOTS, or Geordi La Forge, from Star Trek: The Next Generation. \nYou also may have grown up with me on Reading Rainbow. \nIt was my mother who taught me that, by picking up a book, I could \"go anywhere\" and \"be anything.\" Ever since Reading Rainbow began in 1983, I have dedicated myself to fostering a love of reading in children, just as my mother did for me. \nOver the past year, I have watched Kickstarter bring communities together to support artists and inventors. Again and again, I have been inspired by watching like-minded people team up to accomplish impossible dreams, and to change the world. \nNow, I am hoping you will join me on my mission: to bring Reading Rainbow back for every child, everywhere.\nTogether, we can change the lives of millions of children. But you don't have to take my word for it: just keep reading!\nI believe that every child has a right, and a need, to be literate. We have a responsibility to prepare our children\u2026 and right now, the numbers show that we, as a society, are failing in that responsibility.\nAnd here\u2019s the problem:\nAnd: numerous studies reveal that children who can't read at grade level by the 4th grade are 400% more likely to drop out of high school.\nAnd: as of 2011, America was the only free-market country where the current generation was less well educated than the one before.\nThese problems won't solve themselves.  Real change will require us all to work together. We cannot afford to lose generations of children to illiteracy. And if we work together, we don't have to.\nThrough Reading Rainbow, we've been working to solve these problems for over three decades. Starting in 1983, Reading Rainbow successfully used television to turn generations of kids into lifelong readers... with great results.\nOf course, when Reading Rainbow began in 1983, we were using television to bring books to kids, meeting them where they wanted to be. In 2014, TV is not that place anymore. Now, we\u2019re trying to reach a new generation of digital natives.\nThat\u2019s why, two years ago, I launched the Reading Rainbow App for tablets. Building on the basics of the television series, we put hundreds of quality books \u2013 and educational video field trips \u2013 right in a child\u2019s hands.\nThe response has been encouraging:\nBut despite this progress, there are big challenges left to face.\nFirst, not all families have access to tablets. Our goal is to cultivate a love of reading in all children, not just those that have tablets. To reach kids everywhere, we need to be everywhere: we need to be on the web, on mobile devices, on game consoles and on connected televisions. \nSecond, a resounding number of teachers have told me that they want Reading Rainbow in their classrooms, where they know it can make a difference. We will provide it, along with the tools that teachers need, including teacher guides, leveling, and dashboards. And with your help, we'll provide it to thousands of disadvantaged classrooms for FREE.\nEvery Home. Reading Rainbow\u2019s digital collection already contains hundreds of books and video field trips\u2026 but with your help, we\u2019ll be able to make the Reading Rainbow library available on more of the devices modern kids use to consume content. Now that we've met our initial goal of $1,000,000, we will be able to launch a new version of Reading Rainbow on the single most-used digital platform: the web. And now that we've reached our stretch goal of$5,000,000, we'll also be able to bring the service to mobile phones, Android, game consoles like XBOX and PlayStation, and set-top boxes like AppleTV and ROKU.\nEvery Classroom. Together, we want to provide Reading Rainbow to as many classrooms as possible FOR FREE! Now that we've reached our stretch goal of $5,000,000, we'll be able to provide year-long subscriptions in over 7,500 classrooms \u2013 and every additional $100K we raise lets us help 500 more!\nNo matter how much we raise, we promise that every dollar you pledge will bring Reading Rainbow to more platforms, and provide it for free in more classrooms.\nWe can make sure that millions of kids learn to love reading, but we can\u2019t do it without you. That's why I hope you\u2019ll join me in making a difference!\nI believe that spreading the love of reading is its own greatest reward. But if you're going to join our cause, we also have some wonderful prizes. But you don't have to take my word for it... Take a look!\nAside from the signed book, the rewards above will be available to anyone who pledges! \nBut we also have several LIMITED EDITION rewards... so be sure to get them before we run out! (And if we DO run out, keep checking back -- we'll do our best to add more when we can!)\nOr, if you prefer, you can also pledge for a reward package that will be gifted to the classroom or school of your choice!\nAnd, if you're just interested in Star Trek related rewards, and don't want all of the Reading Rainbow goodies above, we've also got a few special reward levels created just for you:\nThis Kickstarter \u2013 and Reading Rainbow \u2013 couldn't happen alone, so I want you to meet the full team behind our Kickstarter.\nEverytime I walk into the office, I am reminded that the Reading Rainbow team is made up of passionate, talented artists, producers, engineers, and so many more. Most of them grew up on the show, have families of their own now, and dedicate their working day to improving the lives of the next generation.  \nIt's an honor to be surrounded by my Reading Rainbow family every day, and we can't wait for you to join us.

We strongly encourage submissions of stories featuring underrepresented groups in SFF: characters of color, QUILTBAG characters, disabled characters, etc. This ties directly to the mission of Crossed Genres Publications: to give a voice to people often ignored or marginalized in SFF, which has led us to publish titles focused on older women, overweight women, immigration, skilled laborers, QUILTBAG families, and people marginalized throughout history.\nWe've been offering subscriptions to the magazine since its relaunch, but we haven't reached the point where CG Magazine is self-sustainable. This Kickstarter will pay for the next year of issues - including a pay raise for authors from $0.05/word to $0.06/word - and hopefully get CG Magazine to the point where it can support itself without more crowdfunding!\n\"You say that, but how do we know the magazine will reach self-sustainable levels?\"\nWhile there are no guarantees against the unexpected, we simply need to reach the point where the subscriptions we have will cover a year's costs. We've already built up a significant subscription base, well over half of what we need to reach sustainability. If this Kickstarter reaches its goal, it should be enough to push us over the top, with a bit of a cushion to cover for subscriptions which don't get renewed.\n\"You've paid $0.05 per word up until now. Why are you trying to raise enough to pay $0.06 per word? It makes your goal higher!\"\nOne reason is to maintain our standing as an official qualifying professional market for Science Fiction & Fantasy Writers of America. SFWA recently decided to raise what they consider a qualifying rate from $0.05/word to $0.06/word, beginning July 1. We want to raise our rates to match or exceed that, starting with our July issue (#19). It's important to us that markets which encourage stories featuring underrepresented people can thrive in the SFF community, and for us, part of accomplishing that is maintaining a professional status.\nAlso, we (and others) have observed that higher pay rates result in more submissions. More submissions expand the variety of stories available to the editors, which increases our opportunities to deliver diversity, inclusion and quality to our readers!\nAnd just as significantly - we want to pay authors better! In fact, we wish we could pay even more! The current rate of pay for short story authors in SFF is low. As a very small press without publishers who can invest their own money, we can't realistically expect to pay $0.25/word, or even $0.15/word, any time soon, but we can at least keep our rates up to SFWA levels. And hopefully higher - that's why some of our stretch goals involve raising our rates to $0.07/word, or more!\nCosts\nThe vast majority of money we receive from the Kickstarter will go towards paying authors and artists. A small portion will go to other book expenses, like purchasing ISBNs, obtaining proof copies, etc. 10% is for Kickstarter/Amazon Payments fees. And the rest is for rewards fulfillment, and any other unanticipateable costs.\nStretch Goals\nIf we pass our initial goal, We'll strive to make CG Magazine even better:\nWe'd love to be able to pay authors more, beyond the $0.06/word minimum to keep our pro-rate status. The first and third stretch goals would make that possible. For the second stretch goal, upgrades to the website would include:\nA new look designed with online reading in mind, both on computers and mobile devices. A simple, easy-on-the-eyes look that doesn't sacrifice function.\nA completely new submission system. Streamlined to make it easier for authors, and will enable authors to track the status of their submissions. it'll also speed up the process on our end, which means our turnaround time will be faster.\nAn integrated online store, for readers who'd rather buy direct from us than through a giant retailer. Will also make it possible for us to offer limited items like signed and out-of-print books.\nMagazine subscriptions managed through the website, which will make every aspect of sharing the magazine much easier for us and for subscribers. \nAnd if we manage to make it ALL the way to the fourth stretch goal? Every issue of CG Magazine from issue #19 on will have an additional story! More great fiction for the same cost!\nRewards\nSome of the rewards you can get by supporting CG Magazine!\n********************\nNEW! \"I'll Take One of Everything!\" Can't decide what you want?

It's a goal we've been working towards since we launched our very first issue in December 2008.\nBut the elation of reaching the goal was tempered by the knowledge that we need this Kickstarter to succeed in order to not lose that status - indeed, to not lose the magazine altogether. Both of CG's publishers are out of work and we can't afford to put our own money into keeping the magazine going. That's why we've turned to you. And we sincerely hope this is the last time the magazine needs a Kickstarter! Thanks very much for your support!\n- Bart, Kay & Kelly", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've been running Crossed Genres for over 5 1/2 years now, and this is our fifth Kickstarter - we have a pretty good handle on how to run the magazine as well as our other publications, and take care of rewards fulfillment. \n\nThe one area which might take some time to deal with would be the new website, since we'd be working with the designers on a completely new, ground-up site.

With a scene shop at one end and a rehearsal space at the other, The Sand Box is a place for adults to do the same: to create sets, props, and blocking all in one facility. It's tailored to small theater and film companies, and is part of founder Sandy Yaklin\u2019s ongoing experiment in sharing and reusing resources.\nUpdate: As January 15, we have reached our goal!! We cannot thank you enough for your support of this space and the ideas behind it. We will keep the Kickstarter running through its conclusion on February 7th.\nAny donations you should choose to make from here on WILL NOT go to a hot tub, they will go directly into offsetting The Sand Box's rent, utilities, and insurance in the coming months - which will help us maintain our low rehearsal and shop rental rates for the entire arts community.\nTools!\nTHE BACKSTORY\nThe creators of The Sand Box are members of Gideon Productions, a critically acclaimed independent theater company that has produced award-winning new plays in New York City since 2000. When Sandy, Gideon\u2019s resident set designer, urgently needed to find a new design and building space \u2013 particularly given the high price of real estate in NYC \u2013 she got creative. Gideon Productions had recently partnered with Boomerang Theatre Company and Flux Theatre Ensemble to form the \u201cBFG\u201d alliance to collectively rent the Secret Theatre in Queens, so it made sense to reach out to them and Vampire Cowboys about sharing a storage, shop, and rehearsal space for future productions. Before long, this idea had expanded into a vision of a community space that could be available at low rental rates to a variety of New York-based independent theater and film companies. The result is a unique resource located in the heart of the increasingly popular Long Island City.\nSet Built at The Sand Box (Nov 2013)\nTHE HELP!\nThrough a great deal of effort and use of personal funds by the founders, we have managed to get The Sand Box initially up and running. We\u2019ve moved in and, thanks to the help of several generous volunteers, built the walls needed along with chop-saw & work tables. But we have a ways to go in order to complete The Sand Box facility and ensure that its green, artist \u2013friendly mission can be maintained over the long haul. Your donations will not only support the completion of the space, but will vitally also offset our cost so that we can rent the shop and rehearsal spaces at below market prices.\nHere\u2019s what your donations will both buy and help pay off:\nCushioned flooring for the rehearsal room so that people can rehearse fights and choreography;\nMaterials to build a cabinet to store the sheet goods companies need to build flats and platforms;\nBraces to build shelves to hold lumber;\nChain link fence for storage;\nLockable tool cabinet;\nHardware to mount backdrops for photography;\nCurtains to block light and sound in the rehearsal room;\nDrills;\nA handheld sawzall for cutting tough stuff; and\nA hand truck for load-ins and load-outs. (Ours was stolen, and anyone who\u2019s hefted a heavy set-piece knows what a vital tool these are!)\nAll levels of donation \u2013 indeed, any donation \u2013 will help to complete \u2013 and improve! \u2013 The Sand Box space and make it affordable for New York\u2019s independent artists and companies. As independent theater artists ourselves, we know the challenges people like us are facing, and we think The Sand Box could help. Both New York independent theater and film can benefit greatly, and, with your help, we can make it happen. Thanks for reading this, and if you can't donate, we hope you can check out and use The Sand Box.\nTHE SPACE\nThe 1200-square foot Sand Box boasts a scene shop and a rehearsal space just one subway stop outside of Manhattan. It\u2019s located at 44-02 11th Street, Suite 502, Long Island City, NY 11101 just blocks from the Court Square E, M, 7, and G stops.\nThe Shop Space\nAlthough this Kickstarter push is to finish equipping the Sand Box, the shop already has many tools. We have a chop saw with a 12 foot-long table and portable table, circ and jig saws. We also have an air compressor with compatible staple and nail guns, routers, sanders, drills/drivers, grinders and various hand tools. The shop has a 22 by 12-foot workspace with a 10+ foot ceiling and a large work-table. Renters will also be able to paint in the shop, and there\u2019s a huge slop sink just a short walk down the hall.\nThanks to the building\u2019s two sizable freight elevators, companies using The Sand Box to build and rehearse their shows could work there right up until tech week and then load out their new set-pieces with ease. The closer freight elevator is near The Sand Box, and is available 24/7. The giant one is run by an operator from 9AM to 5PM Monday through Friday. Part of the purpose for our funding drive is to be able to offer the scene shop at a low rental rate of $75 a day.\nThe Rehearsal Space\nThe 16 by 17-foot rehearsal space gets a lot of additional light from big windows looking out onto LIC. The rehearsal area is carpeted, and a number of chairs, benches, and tables are available for use. (Bonus: there\u2019s a white wall along one side that works great for headshot and production photography.) Women and Men\u2019s bathrooms are a few steps outside our suite. We will work with companies to temporarily store set pieces and props to use until they load into their theater space. As with the scene shop, we hope to be able to offer the low rental rate of $10 per hour for the rehearsal space, as well as package options for renting the shop and rehearsal space together.\nThe Chain Link Storage\nWe have five storage units that have been rented by our resident companies: Boomerang Theatre Company, Flux Theatre Ensemble, Gideon Productions and Vampire Cowboys.\nTHE GREEN PART\nWe hate throwing stuff away \u2013 especially when new shows and films are going into production constantly and might be able to use that very item you\u2019re about to put in the dumpster! Right now we can only store a limited amount of set pieces and props, but we hope to expand our capacity over the next few years with your help. In the meanwhile, The Sand Box is serving as the home base for the Shared Independent Theater List (a.k.a. the Sh.I.T. List), a website that companies and artists can use to sell/rent/barter/give away their set pieces, furniture, props and costumes. The wonderful LIT Fund has generously given us a grant to underwrite the project, and we expect to launch the website by early Spring 2014. So why are we mentioning this in a Kickstarter appeal? Good question: the LIT Fund grant covers the creation of the website, not the physical facility. With your help, we can give this green enterprise \u2013 which could save small companies a lot of money \u2013 a starter home. For more information about the Sh.I.T. List, check out the video at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnQBcUJyIX0.\nTHE FUTURE\nThe Sand Box is just the beginning. If our experiment works, we hope to expand our facilities. We\u2019d like to offer storage spaces to more small companies to make it easier for them to build, share and recycle theater goods. We\u2019d also like to be able to house items available through the Sh.I.T. List. We may be small companies individually, but together we can be mighty.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Sand Box has come a long way in a short time. We have passed the big initial hurdles: renting the space, securing insurance, and putting the basic facilities in place. If you can help us defray these significant start-up costs, we can focus on our next two crucial challenges:\n\nFirst, we need to market the space to the independent theater and film communities and bring in steady rental income (again, at below market prices). We need to make artists and companies aware that The Sand Box is here, that it's easy to get to, and that our rental rates are intentionally low to support independent theater and film. We are already preparing some marketing initiatives, but you can help by spreading the word.  \n\nSecond, we need to make sure the space is a viable economic entity over the long term. Importantly, this does not mean we are seeking to make this space a profitable enterprise. We are committed to covering the expenses of The Sand Box for at least a year to give us time to grow. What it does mean is that we do eventually want to move toward a situation where rental income is covering our basic running costs. Beyond that, we would eventually like to be able to pay Sandy a small salary, as she is unable to work full time while maintaining The Sand Box's operations.  As our first year progresses, we'll reshape our model and figure out ways to bring in income, such as, hosting classes, readings for our resident companies, private music and acting classes, networking and community development parties, and other events along these lines. \n\nWe will work hard to make The Sand Box a continuing place to build and play even as it renews and reforms. Right now the space is functional.

(http://on.wsj.com/1hIurmk) Here is the excerpt:\n\"More encouragingly, PBS recently ordered up a pilot episode for a series called \"OnStage in America\" (www.onstageinamerica.org) devoted to actual regional-theater productions taped in performance. It won't happen, alas, unless the producers can raise enough cash to shoot the pilot, to which end they've launched a Kickstarter campaign. I think that's a wonderful idea.\" - Terry Teachout (Wall Street Journal)\nPBS and OnStage In America, a new nonprofit venture, are joining forces to put the best theater productions from across America on prime-time national television, in a fresh and exciting format. This will be the first series to focus on the more than one thousand stages nationwide that have originated 36 of the last 38 Pulitzer-Prize-winning plays.\nPBS has ordered a pilot for the series and is providing a portion of the budget. OnStage is seeking $250,000.00 to complete the budget, hoping to raise more from Kickstarter than our $125,000.00 target.\nTHE PROGRAM\nAfter funding our budget we will shoot a pilot program in spring of 2014 that will air on PBS primetime.\nWe have reviewed more than 300 productions scheduled for next spring in theaters around the country. We've narrowed that list to fifty of the most interesting, including Pulitzer Prize winners, comedies, and powerful new dramas. Once they're in performance, we will select one that is truly exceptional.\nWe will go onstage with lightweight high-def cameras, moving with the actors to capture drama with freedom and intimacy. Unlike the usual theater on tv, performances will shift toward the cameras (and television audiences). Skilled directors and cinematographers will capture close-ups, traveling shots, inserts, high angles, low angles etc. to transform live theater into innovative and exciting television. It's unlike anything PBS has attempted before.\nTHE SERIES\nIf the pilot succeeds, PBS will order a full series, bringing four of the best stage productions from across America to primetime television each year. Almost a thousand stage productions will be reviewed annually to find the most exciting, the most entertaining, the most unusual and surprising, and the most relevant to issues of contemporary life in this country.\nFollowing their broadcast, the plays will become part of a digital library, accessible for on-demand, streaming, and other digital distribution.\nWHY IS IT IMPORTANT?\nAmerican theater is absent from the landscape of electronic media, yet in America's towns and cities theater audiences number in the tens of millions. Regional theater nurtures many of this country's best writers, actors, and directors. It has freedom to be more experimental, more daring, more focused on contemporary issues than most feature films and television shows.\nThe creative core of American theater is in the network of more than a thousand not-for-profit theaters in every one of the fifty states. Our series will turn a well-deserved spotlight on their freshest, most surprising, and most illuminating performances.\nWHAT ARE WE ASKING FOR?\nWe want to raise more than $125,000 from our Kickstarter campaign. This, together with the money promised by PBS and a little more than $100,000 from private donors, will fully fund our pilot and blaze the way for the series.\nOUR COMMITMENT\nThe producers have been preparing this series for five years, working long hours without pay. They have had extensive conversations with theater professionals, television executives, and union and guild representatives, successfully building support for the series and clearing away potential obstacles. PBS' recent commitment to help produce a pilot is THE crucial step toward making the series a reality.\nWhen the pilot is completed we will use it to secure financial support for the full series from individuals, foundations, and corporations.\nOUR TEAM\nJohn Fox, Executive Producer.

The decision whether to move forward to produce a full series lies entirely with PBS and will depend in large part on how successful the pilot is. \n\nIf our Kickstarter campaign raises $125,000 we still need to raise an additional $125,000 to fully fund the budget for our pilot. We already have pledges for about $25,000 from private donors and hope to be able to close the funding gap once our Kickstarter campaign succeeds, but there are no guarantees. \n\nWhat happens if Kickstarter succeeds but we fail to get the next $125,000? PBS will decide. They can release the money they have promised us so we can move into production while continuing to raise money, or they can stop us.

Thank you everyone! Watch the backer updates for construction progress -- and here's the permanent web home of the Gemini & Scorpio Loft: http://www.geminiandscorpio.com/loft.html ]\nYou are invited to participate in the creation of something unique and magical.\nWe are Gemini and Scorpio (@gemini_scorpio), creators of immersive themed costume events with live entertainment and editors of a weekly underground NYC events list. More on G&S is in our bio below, if you've not heard of us -- but we hope you have: from our events, which have ranged from Brooklyn warehouses to Lincoln Center; from the NYC creative types, whether artists, performers or burners; or from our many press accolades -- from The New York Times and New York Magazine to TimeOut and The Village Voice.\nWhat Gemini & Scorpio parties look like\nIn our 10 years of creating events, publishing the list, and being in the overlapping communities of producers and performers, the one consistent issue we've encountered in NYC is lack of affordable arts space. When cities have large cheap spaces, the arts thrive. But when all available spaces are turned into luxury condos, artisanal cocktail bars, and bottle service clubs, the makers of alternative, artistic culture have nowhere to go. We could count on one hand the number of remaining functioning underground arts spaces in NYC.\nWe'd been looking for the perfect spot for nearly four years. When we walked into this one, we knew right away this was home. And with G&S turning ten years old on Feb 14, 2013, we knew this was the time.\nThe G&S Loft with daylight streaming through skylights and roof door\nHere is a location we can finally use for all those events that are vital to building community but don't generate much income, created by us or others: all-ages brunches with live music and dancing, theatrical performances, art shows, benefits for causes/artists/communities, talks on curious topics, hands-on artistic experiences, costume sales, dinner parties, movie nights on our giant roof, music showcases, activist gatherings, art & science lectures, yoga/dance/capoeira/acro classes\u2026 Many of these types of events have already taken place here over the last year, and more keep getting booked all the time. The loft is also where we can focus on elevating the experience of our own immersive themed parties, instead of wasting time on venue hunting.\nImages from some events that have already happened at the loft in the last year\nWe make a big effort to keep the prices of G&S events affordable while paying all our artists, as we believe the arts should be both accessible and sustainable. Of course this means that there isn't much money for us to create as complete a transformation of the space as we would like. We hope you, our community, both artists and arts lovers, will join us in building a new home for what we do, so we can continue to protect and present the arts, grow audiences, and make magic happen -- together.\nThe G&S Loft set up as a fairy forest for an immersive production of Midsummer Night's Dream earlier this year\nWHERE YOUR MONEY IS GOING\nG&S has already invested close to $30,000 in the space: demolition, trash removal, insulation, finished floors in parts of the space, partial sanding of the floor in main event area, building of multiple rooms and bathrooms, partial electric & plumbing, new window installation, etc. \nHere's the loft as we first saw it back in October 2011.\nHere are the next scheduled improvements, and where your donations will go:\n- Sanding and sealing main event space floors, $8,000\n- Removing paint, re-mortaring & refinishing main space walls, $10,000\n- Removing old tin ceiling, installing insulation and new ceiling in main space, $8,000\n- Fixing skylights, $1,000\n- Fixing/replacing roof and fire escape doors and adjacent flooring, $1,000\n- Window finishing & insulation, $1,000\n- New hot water heater and related plumbing, $2,000\n- Completing two toilet stalls (walls & floor tile), $2,000\n- Completing main bath (shower, tub, walls & floor tile), $7,000\n- Electric & lighting in main event area, $4,000\n- Central air / heat, $6,000\nTOTAL: $50,000\nAs you can see, even this total is greater than our asking goal -- and that's not yet factoring in professional sound and lights, kitchen and office buildout, and of course ongoing venue decor improvements, which easily adds up to another $30k. In the future, we even hope to look into putting solar panels, an apiary, and possibly even a small farm on our 3,000sq ft roof. The more we can raise, the better we can make the space, faster.\nWe've been working on the loft bit by bit almost every day for the last year, but the financial reality of the space hasn't allowed us to pause long enough to make real change happen -- and whatever savings we'd put aside for the project have long been spent. With this campaign's financial boost, we'll finally be able to do the big renovation. The current plan is to go dark in July-August, and return, sparkly and new, in the fall.\nThe back half of the loft after demolition: we'd knocked down an office and bathroom, and stripped down walls.\nWe need your help, community. For 10 years now, G&S has been bringing together the arts and the audience: getting artists paid and known for their work while giving audiences one-of-a-kind nightlife experiences. This space will enable us to do more (and better) of the same, and we hope that you will support our mission, whether you may benefit as performer or guest, or simply get joy as an arts supporter. Thank you.\nREWARDS\nThe rewards you see here represent just a small fraction of the community we have supported over the years (the artists who've performed at our parties, the producers whose events we list in our newsletter, etc) and hope to continue to support via the space. Follow these generous and talented people's links to learn more about the magic they create. Now, for some additional info...\nBUNDLES:\n- The $5 reward (thank you card, backer updates, etc) and the $15 reward (music download bundle) are included with ALL donations above those amounts, respectively, and the $75 Champagne \"Thank You\" Gala ticket is included with all rewards over $200.\n- Everyone who supports at the $75 level and above is entitled to request a secret G&S token, redeemable for future happenings not open to general public.

The events are often marked by offbeat themes, fantastic costumes, mind-blowing music, burlesque and circus performances, unique art and decor, and wild dancing into the morning. They've been written up in The New York Times, NY Post, The Village Voice, TimeOut NY, Flavorpill, Brooklyn Based, and many others, but amNY put it best in their \"Nightlife Trends 2011\" - \"Expect a setting that\u2019s both festive and whimsical, featuring art installations, roving performers, cheap drinks and DJ sets that run late into the night.

This is why we've waited a year to even ask for help: to make sure we have a plan and know that we can do this.

Remember?  Books in which... an adventure is chosen??\nThese three things got mashed up together into one BASICALLY AMAZING BOOK full of JOKES and also SWORDFIGHTS and GHOSTS and AWESOME AS A MASS NOUN.  But don't take my word for it:\nUPDATE: TO BE OR NOT TO BE IS NOW THE PERFECT GIFT!\nWhile we won't be delivering the books in time for Christmas, if you pledge $30 or more, you unlock a Kickstarter-exclusive Holiday Hamlet ecard that can be sent directly to your gift recipient.  You can read about that here!  It's the perfect last-minute gift for anyone on your list (assuming they are good at waiting for things) (and also like to read)!  Also we've unlocked lots of new prizes at each reward level: be sure to check the updated list!\nWHAT MAKES THIS BOOK AWESOME??\nA few things:\nIF YOU LIKE SHAKESPEARE:\nMy friend: it is exactly as awesome as you remember, only now you're playing the main character instead of watching someone else just PRETEND to be him.\nAlso unlike Shakespeare I didn't skip over the pirate scene in Hamlet.  You get to fight PIRATES.  With SWORDS.  And yes OF COURSE you can choose which body part you cut off.  Why would you write a book where you can't do that is my question.\nIF YOU HATE SHAKESPEARE BUT STILL HAVE TO READ IT:\nYOU WON'T HATE HIM ANYMORE.  Honest!  This is great literature in what has to be the most accessible, friendly format ever.  If you ever struggled with wondering what was going on and what people's motivations were in the play, you will totally understand everything once you play through this book, assuming you make the same choices Shakespeare did when he played it.  That doesn't mean this book is written for children.  It just means it's easy to understand someone's motivations when you're the one making the decisions!\nHey speaking of that, making the same choices Shakespeare did will be easy as there will be little Yorick skulls beside the \"canonical\" choices.  So if you want to stick to the plot of the play, that's not a problem!  It's super easy!  But I'll warn you: Shakespeare's choices didn't lead to the best ending for the characters.  Not by a long shot.\nWhile the book itself is told in modern language, for each of the big speeches, you have the option to say it in the original beautiful and fancy language, or you can have told in modern language, like with Hamlet rapping it or whatever.  IT IS TOTALLY YOUR CALL.\nIF YOU LIKE THE POTENTIAL OF READER-DRIVEN NARRATIVE AND HAVE BEEN FRUSTRATED IN THE PAST:\nYep, I hear you.  The interactive books of our youth often suffered from arbitrary plotlines and capricious death.  This book puts you in a real, consistent world where your choices matter.  Also there are ghosts.  Also you can play as a ghost.  Also you can haunt the planet for generations because GHOSTS DON'T DIE.\nWHOAH REALLY??\nYep!  In fact, the first choice you make is to choose your character, and each character has their own storyline.  Storylines, actually: dozens and dozens of storylines.  You can play as Hamlet, his girlfriend Ophelia, and his dad Hamlet Sr, who (SURPRISE) dies on the first page and becomes a ghost.  And then we make fun of you for dying on the first page, but you can become a ghost and must INVESTIGATE YOUR OWN MURDER that you TOTALLY SLEPT THROUGH because you got SLEEPY IN AN ORCHARD. (Shakespeare wrote this part, I can't help it.)\nOphelia's adventure is as well-thought-out as Hamlet's, but rather than being a hero suffering from crippling inaction, you are a smart, self-sufficient woman who knows what she wants and is totally rad 100% of the time, and also you are dating a PRINCE.  You can choose what you want to do with your life: help your boyfriend who's crying about a spooky ghost, or I don't know TAKE DOWN INTERNATIONAL TERRORISTS INSTEAD??  It's nuts.  It's awesome.  Oh my gosh.\nIF YOU HAVE NO INTEREST IN HAMLET AT ALL BUT LIKE FUNNY JOKES:\nThen I can assure you this book is still totally awesome and chock full of those things you like.  You can (AND WILL?) love this book even if you've never had any particular interest in to being or not to being.  This is a book written for adults who like only the most awesome of things.  That is you.  I know it. \nI've used the story of Hamlet as a starting point, but a) that's already a great story because it ends with pretty much everyone in it getting stabbed in the body and b) the story can go in all sorts of fun, crazy directions when you make a choice that Shakespeare didn't.  \nTELL ME MORE ABOUT THE BOOK!\nThe book itself is already written: it's 80,000 words of comedy and mayhem that I lovingly crafted together myself over the past year.  80,000 words is about what you'd call an \"actual book-length book\".  So why the Kickstarter?  One reason, really:\n\nWe are going to decide how amazing this book is going to be.\n\nThe more money we raise, the better the book will be.  Paperbacks and hardcovers and nice paper stock are a given, but we'll also be adding PICTURES.  And not just any pictures: PICTURES DONE BY SOME THE BEST VISUAL ARTISTS AND ILLUSTRATORS ALIVE TODAY.  I say this without hyperbole, and as proof offer up this alphabetical list of Amazing People Who Are Doing Pictures For This Book, Look At All These Amazing People, I Love Them:\nAaron Diaz (Dresden Codak)\nAlex Thomas (Star Wars: The Old Republic)\nAndrew Hussie (MS Paint Adventures)\nAndy Runton (Owly)\nAnthony Clark (Nedroid)\nBecky (Tiny Kitten Teeth)\nBraden Lamb and Shelli Paroline (Adventure Time, Ice Age)\nBrandon Bird (What Nat Saw, so many amazing paintings)\nBrian McLachlan (The Princess Planet)\nCarly Monardo (so many good things)\nChip Zdarsky (The National Post, Extremely Bad Advice)\nChris Hastings (The Adventures of Dr. McNinja)\nChris Jones (Snowflakes)\nDanielle Corsetto (Girls With Slingshots)\nDavid Hellman (Braid, A Lesson Is Learned But The Damage Is Irreversible, Second Quest)\nDavid Troupes (Buttercup Festival)\nDave Kellett (Sheldon)\nDavid Malki (Wondermark)\nDustin Harbin (Dharbin!)\nDylan Meconis (Family Man, Outfoxed)\nEmily Carroll (The Prince And The Sea, so many others)\nEmily Partridge (Mount Pleasant Comics)\nEthan Nicolle (Axe Cop)\nFaith Erin Hicks (Nothing Can Possibly Go Wrong, Friends With Boys)\nJeff Rowland (Overcompensating, Wigu)\nJeph Jacques (Questionable Content)\nJess Fink (Chester 5000 XYV)\nJim Zubkavich (Skullkickers)\nJohn Allison (Bad Machinery, Scary Go Round)\nJohn Campbell (Pictures For Sad Children)\nJohn Keogh (Lucid TV)\nJohn Martz (Heaven All Day, Drawn.com)\nJon Rosenberg (Scenes From A Multiverse)\nKate Beaton (Hark!

AND MORE (surprise artists?  YES)\nWHAT'S THE MONEY GOING TOWARDS?\nIf we reach our goal for the book, I'll be able to release the book as a professionally-edited, professionally typeset, professionally-designed beautiful volume with a single illustration commissioned from each of these artists, each rendering a different way your story can end.  And the more money we raise, the more deaths get illustrated, until we have all 110 deaths done!  You can die a lot in a book like this, and I want to make each time something to look forward to.  I want it to be a treat.\nIn the video, I've included images showing each artist's style, and in some cases, an actual detail from an illustration I've already commissioned from them.  It is a SNEAK PEEK (assuming this project reaches its funding goals and is a success, otherwise it is just TANTALIZING GLIMPSES INTO A WORLD THAT WAS NOT MEANT TO BE)\nThis book will be published with help from Breadpig, who have a proven track record in bringing awesome into the real world.  They're the publishers behind super rad, super quality books like XKCD: volume 0, SMBC: Save Yourself, Mammal! and The Most Dangerous Game, and most recently, Zach Weiner's own chooseable-path gamebook also launched here on Kickstarter, The Trial Of The Clone. \nHOW DO I KNOW THIS BOOK IS AWESOME THOUGH??\nWell, I can tell you I think it's my best work so far.  And while you can't read this book just yet, pretty much everything else I've ever written is online for free!  I mentioned a bunch of it at the top of the page, but there's still more, like B^F, where I reviewed the insane novelization of Back to the Future, page by page, and my Twitter account, where I tell jokes that are short because it's Twitter, that's what it's there for!\nBUT ALL THAT ASIDE, I've worked to include every amazing thing possible in a book like this.  There's loops, alternate endings, secret paths and things that I'm pretty sure haven't even been done before in the medium.  Also, instead of a play-within-a-play to trap the conscience of a king, there's an \"an-adventure-is-chosen\" book within this \"an-adventure-is-chosen\" book, which you read while playing as King Claudius reading this nested book!  It's a whole separate book contained within this book, with cover and illustrations done by Andrew Hussie.  It's kinda the best?\nFor every 5K we raise, I'll post another section from the book!  We'll all choose what path we take... TOGETHER.  So you can read some of it that way too!\nTELL ME A BIT ABOUT THESE REWARDS\nEvery reward level gets you a DRM-free digital download of the book.  $15 is all it takes!  And this is highly appreciated.  But if you want to contribute more, there are some fun things I can offer in exchange!  Because things have been going so well, every tier threshold now includes TWO brand-new, never-released-anywhere Dinosaur Comics ebooks, so it's three books for the price of one.  PLUS if you donate a little extra, we'll throw in things like a plush Yorick skull (cutest ever!), an amazing multiple-path bookmark designed for this multiple-path book, awesome stickers and TATTOOS, a choose-your-own cover reversible dust jacket, a poster showing a map of the entire choice-structure of the book (beautiful, lose yourself in it), an audiobook version, all the way up to custom comics and custom little adventures starring YOU that I will write and that will be super rad extreme.  Keep reading to find out more about the rewards and what's left to unlock!  These are priced to raise money for this publishing project, but they're still pretty good deals too! \nNot everything reward is listed in the tiers over there to the right (they can't be edited once they've started) but rest assured you'll be getting all the prizes you've earned here.  I made a page that shows an up-to-date listing for each tier!  And the more money we raise, the more new rewards get unlocked that'll be automatically applied to people who have already contributed :o\nWHAT IF WE RAISE MORE MONEY THAN WHAT'S NEEDED?  DO AMAZING THINGS HAPPEN?\nYep!  If the book reaches its goal, yep, there's plenty of motivation to keep going!  I've got lots of plans for awesome things we could do to make this book the BEST EVER.  They include:\n$20,000 = UNLOCKED!!! Base goal, book printed w. 30 illustrations.

Your one hope is an opening at the royal court for a jester.  Seems easy enough: the listing says your responsibilities are \"...to entertain Kid Hamlet and also to not end up dead at every turn\".

If you're getting this book as a gift for someone, here's something you can print out and give them in time for Christmas.  Plus, we'll ALSO add another 25 books to the pile we're sending out to schools.

ALMOST DEFINITELY.\n$300,000 = UNLOCKED: To Be Or Not To Be will now be printed in full colour.  We've taken a simple black-and-white book with 30 illustrations and turned it into a full-colour, fully-illustrated, gorgeous volume.

Also because it's going to be great.  I've put a list of other things I've done above, offering them up as my Comedy Credentials, and hope that all these mostly-free content will encourage you to take a wee tiny risk on something that's not free.  I've been insanely lucky to be able to make a living by being an online cartoonist and writer - one of the very few to live this awesome dream - and I'd like to keep producing cool things for awesome strangers.  Hopefully this experiment is a success!\nPrototype cover with art by Noelle Stevenson, she is the best\nDUDE.

The main challenge will be in corralling the artists to get the illustrations on time, and then producing the best possible book (and rewards!) we can. This shouldn't be too hard, because as an artist, I know that all artists are incredibly reliable people who love meeting deadlines! Also if this is somehow not the case I will crack the whip on all slackers. Also, we've chosen fulfillment deadlines based on reasonable expectations of how things will go, but if it takes longer, we'll let everyone know and double-down on getting it done.\n\nThe difficulties in producing a physical book are well-known to me (I've self-published several volumes of Dinosaur Comics) and we're prepared for them.

The book covers both Victorian and contemporary sexuality, such as:\nerotica\nsex work\nburlesque\nBDSM\nalternative sexualities\nconsent\nsexual health\nsex devices through the ages\nhistorical attitudes on sex\nand includes a great number of how-to guides covering such things as:\nDIY floggers made with bike tubes\nsteam-powered vibrators\nVictorian aphrodisiacs\nOne of the most common reactions we get, when describing the book to someone new, is: \"Oh, so you're taking this seriously?\" Absolutely. We intend for this book to be fun, lighthearted, fascinating, and useful. There will be a mix of neat history and of information applicable to contemporary subcultures.\nThe Art\nThe book will be illustrated with steamy modern photos shot with the historical tintype process. The camera we're using is almost exactly 100 years old, the lens is from 1891 and the process itself is older still. Unlike the more modern negative film process, we're shooting positive, one-of-a-kind images directly onto aluminum plates.\nThe Series\nThis book is the second in our Steampunk's Guide series: first we did A Steampunk's Guide to the Apocalypse. After this one, we'll start work on our next title, Crime.\nYour Money\nWe're a small publisher, to put it lightly, and we keep our list prices as low as possible. So we don't really have much capital. Sure, we could put out A Steampunk's Guide to Sex via print-on-demand, but we'd have to bump up the cover price for a lower-quality product. We want this book to be your beautiful reference to the kinky side of anachronistic life.

You have made a profound difference in women's lives. If you're getting here after the Kickstarter has ended, you can still support women getting tech jobs by visiting http://ladycoders.com/donate/.\n__________________________\nMissing: Women in Tech\nOur Goal: Mentor And Train Women Who Have Awesome Coding Skills So They Stay In Tech Instead Of Losing Them At Every Level Of Their Career\nWe think it\u2019s awesome that an idea can go from concept to code to worldwide use with nothing more than a laptop and a bit of skill. With so many opportunities to be creative and financially independent in one of the few fields that is growing in a bad economy, why aren\u2019t there more women involved in tech? The lack of women is startling, and we want to help add more skilled women to the technology workforce.\nWomen\u2019s representation in the computing and information technology workforce has fallen over 25% from its peak of close to 40% in the mid-1980s.  We need your help to show women that the freedom, status, and independence of a solid, self-supporting technology career can be theirs. We want to be able to tell ladies that thousands of people have helped to fulfill their need for mentorship and want to see them succeed. We want to do more than just report the depressing lack of women in technology; we want to help change it!\nNo one is teaching qualified and skilled women how to talk to the managers running and hiring for tech teams, or how to handle motherhood when trying to get back into their career after taking a break - or trying to juggle work while nursing! You don't learn in college how to interview for tech teams; if you're lucky, you get a generic class on how to interview in general.\nHow can we balance the scales and mentor women who who will otherwise leave software development as a career?\nWe have learned the hard way how to project ourselves as skilled, competent, easy to work with, and an asset to even an all-male team of programmers. We\u2019ve succeeded in getting jobs and even more offers at places like Microsoft, Amazon, Intel, and many startups, government agencies, and mid-sized companies.  We have identified and can teach the skills that have helped us land these projects.\nWomen lack mentorship at every single level of their information technology careers. We are three senior developers with a crazy number of combined years of experience. We are going to put on a training seminar to show women how using a base skill set can lead to a solid and worthwhile career in software and web development.\nLiz, Lorraine, and Tarah\nWe feel strongly that everyone has the right to this information, even if we can\u2019t quite manage to personally mentor each one. That\u2019s why we\u2019re going to professionally produce the seminar and make 20 short videos from our seminar talks available for free on our website. We are also going to make the full seminar available for download and on DVD as Coding + Confidence.\nWhy we need your help for our seminar\nPutting on a seminar like this is expensive. There are fabulous videographers, editors, and film crews in the Seattle area. Independent film is very important here, and as a result, there\u2019s a lot of local talent to draw on. These people need to eat, and no matter how nicely we ask, they can't work for free. We will be reserving a restaurant and buying lunch on two days for all of the ladies at the seminar to show them how to handle business lunches and interviews, as well as how to use these lunches to develop connections. We will be renting a large office space and conference room for the weekend. An attorney is needed to handle the paperwork to have 40 women all show up in one location, be moved to different restaurants, trained in how to handle a work cocktail function, and to be filmed. All of these costs must be fully or partially paid before the seminar is held.\nWhy don't you just pay for it yourselves if you're so successful?\nWe\u2019re good at what we do, good enough to be independent and able to direct our own careers. So, why aren\u2019t we funding this by taking out a small business loan or approaching venture capitalists? First, banking regulations have tightened down a great deal. We can\u2019t sign on the dotted line anymore and get startup capital--not even the $23,000 we\u2019re asking for here. Second, even angel investors need guaranteed profit. We will run the seminar very close to the margin to make it accessible to as many women as possible, and keep the Coding + Confidence DVD set priced as low as possible, as well as releasing it under a Creative Commons license. This project is meant to help as many people as possible. Our goal isn't to make huge profits, though it is certainly intended to be widely publicized and popular. We would love to repeat this seminar and put on others with more advanced subjects, and to inspire others to join LadyCoders to put on even more seminars around the country and world. We will not buy into a venture capital firm that would go after women who may pirate the video. We\u2019d love it if the ladies would pay for it, but we have the philosophy that we\u2019re providing help to everyone, not just to those who can afford it. We will not go after desperate people for copyright violation. \nFinally, and most importantly, we need to know that there\u2019s support in the software development community at large to see real, quality mentorship brought to the women who need it. Kickstarter makes projects like this happen, and can provide the kind of publicity that we need to pull this off. We\u2019re not just showing women that information technology is a fulfilling, independent career that melds easily with women's needs and life choices. We\u2019re showing women that there\u2019s real, public support to help them break into a workplace that sometimes does not appear very friendly from the outside.  \nWe\u2019re making this seminar available to women on our site at $499 per badge registration. Other two-day training or certification seminars like this charge thousands of dollars for much larger seminars that do not have nearly as much personal time and investment.  We're keeping this small on purpose. A seminar with 2,000 participants wouldn't have much room for us to give each attendee personalized feedback. We have cut the price as much as we can to cover costs and still be able to put together both a quality seminar and a quality video, but we simply can\u2019t do this on our own.\nThe goal.\nWe\u2019ve each individually tried to help. Tarah has filmed an instructional video and written a booklet to provide visual instruction for women on how to present themselves, serves on the Seattle Central Community College Technical Advisory Committee, and writes a blog with even more instruction. Liz has volunteered with the Plone and Grok projects and maintains 2 open source repositories on Github. Lorraine works with female entrepreneurs to help them find the resources they need to get their business started. Before we all met each other, we worked alone. Each of us exhausted her own resources and did all she could under her own power. Just a few months ago, we realized we could accomplish far more together, and formed LadyCoders.\nWe want to teach 40 women in person everything we\u2019ve learned, and to film the seminar to provide this information to every woman on Earth who wants to learn. We\u2019ll create a 4-disc DVD set, and make twenty instructional video clips available to everyone for free via streaming video. You\u2019ll see these women gain confidence, invent projects, team up, learn to create startups and repositories, and project competence.\nWhat happens if this Kickstarter campaign does not succeed?\nWe\u2019ll still try to help.Tarah will still blog and volunteer, Liz will still code and train, and Lorraine will still instruct, but if this campaign does not succeed, we will not have the money to get the event space, pay for filming and editing, broadcast twenty free instructional clips to women around the world, provide distance education through the DVD, and pull this event off. We want to help, and we must have your help to do it.\nFind out more and help us to help women everywhere.\nYou can monitor the project by visiting our website at ladycoders.com/kickstarter, by following us at twitter.com/ladycoders, or by joining our Facebook page at facebook.com/ladycoders. We\u2019ll constantly be posting updates, and there\u2019s also a signup form on our site that will let you receive email updates for the campaign. Please also spread the word to women you know who may be interested in either the DVD or in attending the seminar.\nThe future of women in technology belongs to you. Your help is needed, not just to make this seminar happen, but to show these women and women around the world that we do care, that the status, freedom, and independence of a solid, self-supporting technology career can be theirs. We want to be able to tell these ladies on the first day of the seminar that thousands of people have helped to fulfil their need for mentorship and want to see them succeed.\nSome of our rewards!\nOne of Lorraine's lovely designs on a tshirt!\nStickers!

I also reached out to some new artists I've never worked with, like the german sculptor Heide Hatry, brooklyn writer/artist Tao Lin, and many others. but best of all I talked some of my musician friends (like DJ spooky, kristin hersh from throwing muses, conrad keely from \u2026trail of dead, and one of my songwriting HEROES robyn hitchcock) into making art which you'll be able to see:\n\u2022 in a hard-bound ART BOOK (similar to the \"Who Killed Amanda Palmer\" book) which will contain the art, photos, lyrics, behind-the-scenes looks at some of the artist's creations, and much more\n\u2022 LIVE and IN PERSON on our ART SHOW TOUR June-August (we'll be hitting Berlin, London, Brooklyn, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Boston)\n\nthis is a package i dreamed up for people who like to get SHIT IN THE MAIL, CONSTANTLY. when i was a teenager i used to love 7\"-of-the-month-clubs, punk rock style, and fanzines that would arrive with weird ziploc bags full of crap in them. if you're a freak for surprises...this is the package for you. over the course of the summer, you'll get a series of 5 packages (sent every few weeks starting in july). the final package will include the deluxe backer-edition of the album, and packages 1-4 are going to be limited edition 7\" vinyl that feature some of the amazing album artwork. and with your 7\" singles, i'll also include an ARTS&CRAFTS SURPRISE. i wanted to stay away from things like shirts and posters and crap...i wanted to make things for you to DO, and MAKE, and SHARE back at me. i'm really proud of the bizarre things we thought up for this. the shipping of multiple packages all summer long is going to cost us a lot, and that's reflected in the price.\n\"BUT ((SAD FACE)) I DON'T HAVE A TURNTABLE....\"\nTHEN BUY ONE FROM US. YOU KNOW YOU WANT ONE.\nVINYL IS BACK. we're going to buy and decorate some really high-quality Crosley USB-turntables and include them in higher-priced packages JUST FOR THIS REASON.\nat some point this summer Cassandra Long (who also happens to be my housemate), Meghan Howland, and a few of the other Album Artists are going to have a massive 2-day party in boston during which we get together and paint all these turntables for you. your excuse not to buy vinyl IS GONE! POOF!\n\n\nlast july, I started randomly drawing people who tweeted black and white photos of themselves to me...with a sharpie of course, because I always have one on my person, because THAT is the secret to being a successful musician. I love to draw these in quiet moments on the road or at home before the mayhem of the day starts. I figured I would extend the offer to be a sharpie-rendition of ANYTHING you send - it doesn't have to be you...it could be a loved one, a lost one, a place, a favorite mug...go crazy. we'll pack it up really nicely and send it to you right along with all the music & art book stuffs. here are some that i've done in the past (for twitter-folk @sermoiii and @SDuPreeBemis):\n\ni'll have neil explain this one, because he writes gooder than me. please be amused at the fact he is, therefore, referring to himself in the third person:\n\n\"To make art for 'The Bed Song', Neil wrote a script, as if Neil were making a script for a five panel graphic novel, and gave it to Kyle. Kyle and Neil talked, emailed, Kyle took photos, and the final sequence of five shots that made 'The Bed Song' art was created.\nWhich left us with a lot of amazing photos of people in beds that we didn't use. And we wanted people to see them. So we are making a limited edition book, with writing by Neil and photographs by Kyle and lyrics by Amanda. Unless you are one of the models in the beds, Neil, Kyle or Amanda, this Kickstarter will probably be the only way you can get one, I'm afraid. There will be a limited, signed, numbered edition of 666 copies, with a very small number of additional unnumbered artists proofs.\nWarning. The book contains naked people, naked emotions and unmade beds.\"\n\nTO KICK OFF THIS YEAR OF MADNESS, in which we'll be touring ALL OVER THE WORLD, we're going to unveil the new material and the original large-format album art/paintings LIVE in six select cities: BOSTON, NEW YORK, LA, SAN FRANCISCO, LONDON and BERLIN. in every city, we've PARTNERED with a local ART GALLERY or EVENT SPACE, where we'll hang the art on beautiful walls for y'all to come and admire in person. then we'll have a special kick-off ART OPENING just for kickstarter supporters who back the event. we'll load you down with odd gifts, hugs, and drinks (if you're of age...if not, root beer throwdown) & the band will play a special acoustic set in the Art Space. we're keeping these openings limited to about 100-150, even in spaces where we could fit more people. one of my favorite things about this is that i'll get to MEET you guys in person, and thank you for your backing with a kiss. i'm hoping that our night together, among the art, making acoustic music with the band and sharing wine, will be totally fucking magical & unforgettable.\n\nin each city, we'll ALSO be playing a SMALL plugged-in rock show. the rock shows are open to the general public and have almost all sold out, but the art show kickstarter backers will have guaranteed guest-list to those performances, as well. the tickets to these smaller rock shows will be HARD to get, so backing in your city is a surefire way to know you'll get in.\n\n\neven though we've assembled a tasty variety of backer rewards - $1 all the up to $10,000 - i also know that there are some of you you are HELLA RICH and who would like to put more money towards the project. i know because...i've been asked. SO: for you more invest-y types, i am proud to announce THE LOANSPARK COLLECTIVE.\n\nwith LOANSPARK, i'm not asking for donations; i'm asking for people to step forward as high-level patrons and help out with interest-free loans that will be fully paid back after the album is cranked out and earning money. in exchange for your high-rolling loan, i will make some very special art and/or do a performance to support a charity you're passionate about. it's a slightly mad idea, but if it works, we may be onto a new form of patronage that could work for other artists...so i'm very happy to take a crack at it.\n\nall the info is up on the LOANSPARK WEBSITE, which we've launched in conjunction with this project:\n_________\n\nand that my dear comrades, is it.\n\nWE ARE THE MEDIA: as soon as you support this kickstarter, PLEASE TELL EVERYONE YOU'VE DONE IT, AND SPREAD THE LINK FAR AND WIDE.\nthank you, thank you, thank you.\nLOVE,\namanda\nfucking\npalmer\n\namandapalmer.net | @amandapalmer\np.s. a random note about the video: i DID pick up all those fucking signs i'd drawn. i did not leave them in the street in melbourne. we'll figure out what to do with them later...by the time we finished shooting (we did 2 takes), most of the cards had been run over by a car or a bicycle.\n\nBand photos and KS video by Jim Batt | @battsignal\nCollage of the ART (from l-r, top to bottom): Kyle Cassidy, Tony Albert, Cynthia von Buhler, Cassandra Long, David Mack, and Tony Albert\nAFP/Keytar photo by Andrius Lipsys\nAdditional images/editing/maintenance by Sean Francis | @indeciSEAN", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #27", "update_userinfo": "heya, it's been a minute. long catch-up letter...& i've got a new album", "update_content": "hola everybody!!!\nGreetings from upstate new york. i\u2019ve missed you.\nthis is an email to my long-lost, wonderful 24,883 ttheatre Is evil\u201d kickstarter backers. long time, no see\u2026.\nTL;DR: i am using patronage now. it is awesome & has changed m life. have a new record out. my patrons get tour ticket access for TWO MORE DAYS, & the cool merch. if you still want to help me make art, join at https://www.patreon.com/amandapalmer for as little as $1/month."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #26", "update_userinfo": "\"the bed song book\" is not imaginary, it's coming!!

It's internet lingo.\nV.G.L. = Very good looking.\n5'4\" = my height\nTop = one who holds the penetrative position in anal intercourse.\n\"VGL 5'4\" Top\" is a retort to the way the internet has affected gay men's sexuality. Now that we are being presented with a detailed menu of sexual partners, we have become disastrously picky. So much so that we have begun to treat our fellow homosexuals with a horrifying level of disrespect when don't find them physically attractive. And somehow, a lot of people think this is acceptable.\nI beg to differ. Being a short, boyish looking man who has been regularly  ignored and insulted because his genetic makeup defies traditional laws of masculinity, I want to show the world that sexy comes in all different shapes and sizes. And, as an oppressed subculture being denied equality in the United States, we really can't allow our community to be so divided over such superficial matters.\nWho am I?Aside from the details already mentioned, I am a writer and performer living in New York City (okay, Brooklyn, but that counts.) I hold my degree in theater from Eugene Lang College, The New School for Liberal Arts. It was there, for my senior thesis, that I created this lovely piece of work that I am now trying to haul across the country.\nMy studies have continued since my graduation. In the last three years I have also studied performance art with Tim Miller, boy-lesque with Chris \"Go-Go\" Harder, and taken a master class in vampire-slaying with Susan Blackwell. \nBy day, I am hard at work on my blog, \"Top to Bottom: Chronicles of an Intellectual Homosexual\". It is here that you can find my ramblings and musings on the gay culture, sexuality, and sometimes just my own life issues.\nA great deal of my original material deals with gay men's sexuality. I suppose I would say I consider myself to be a sort of 'internal activist'... my primary mission is to unite LGBT kind and persuade them from being so awful to each other when the rest of the world is already so awful to us. It doesn't make much sense, does it?\nWhat's Happening Now?After three years of growth, my one-man show \"VGL 5'4\" Top\" has been accepted into the San Francisco Fringe Festival! Words cannot explain my level of excitement and gratitude! I have always dreamed of traveling with my own solo show, and I've had my eye on San Francisco for quite some time, so the fact that this is actually happening is a party in itself. But before I can celebrate fully, I have to be sure that I can afford this wonderful excavation.\nWhere the Money's Going:First of all, there was the entrance fee. The SF Fringe gave me a lovely space at the Exit Theater on Taylor, but it's costing me a pretty penny. Then, I have to fly (along with my beloved director Matthew Klein) from the East Coast to the West. The festival runs from September 5-16, so once there we have to stay put for a good two weeks, so I would like to put us up in a reasonably comfortable environment.\nThen there are the usual theatrical necessities: rehearsal space, photos, promotional materials. The things required to make the magic happen and to spread the word. Also, I am planning to have a last-hurrah run in NYC before I leave.\nThis is a lot of work for two people!

Today\u2019s television landscape is increasingly flat when it comes to representations of Latinos. While the 2010 census revealed that with over 50 million Latinos in the United States, 1 out of every 6 people are of Hispanic or Latino origin, that same year, the National Latino Media Council (NLMC) cited a decline in Latino diversity at every major network. Yet these same networks feel entitled to capture our attention for 4-6 hours a day, oversaturating our viewing experience with Latino drug dealers, gardeners, maids, prostitutes, and gang members, as if those were the only jobs we were capable of handling.\nEast WillyB was created to provide an alternative to the limited representations of Latinos in the mainstream media.\nLa inspiraci\u00f3n detr\u00e1s East WillyB:\nVamos a hablar claro. El panorama en la televisi\u00f3n de hoy en d\u00eda es cada vez m\u00e1s mon\u00f3tono cuando se trata de la representaci\u00f3n de los latinos. Mientras en el 2010 el censo revel\u00f3 que con m\u00e1s de 50 millones de latinos en los Estados Unidos; 1 de cada 6 personas son de origen hispano o latino, el mismo a\u00f1o el National Latino Media Council (NLMC) denunci\u00f3 un decaimiento de diversidad latinoamericana en las mayores cadenas de televisi\u00f3n. A\u00fan as\u00ed, estas mismas cadenas se sienten en la posici\u00f3n de capturar nuestra atenci\u00f3n durante 4 a 6 horas diarias, sobresaturando nuestra experiencia como audiencia con imagines de traficantes de droga, jardineros, sirvientas, prostitutas, gangueros, como si estos fueran los \u00fanicos trabajos que somos capaces de hacer.\nEast WillyB se cre\u00f3 para proveer una alternativa a esta representaci\u00f3n limitada de los latinos en los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n masivos dominantes (mainstream media).\nEn East WillyB nosotros entendemos la importancia de capturar la experiencia latina multifac\u00e9tica en los Estados Unidos, porque la hemos vivido y experimentado. Nosotros somos la nueva generaci\u00f3n de latinos, algunos nacidos en los Estados Unidos y otros nacidos en Latinoam\u00e9rica. Hablamos spanglish y ni de aqu\u00ed ni de all\u00e1. Concebida en una cafeter\u00eda en Brooklyn, esta serie se cre\u00f3 luego de que nuestros escritores, actores y productores crecieran cansados de ver los mismos estereotipos de latinos en los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n masivos. As\u00ed que tomamos cartas en el asunto, creando y distribuyendo esta serie a trav\u00e9s de la web y directamente a nuestra comunidad\u2026 Tu.\nHollywood Latinos support East WillyB!\nWe at East WillyB understand the importance of capturing the multi-faceted Latino experience in the United States because we have lived it and experienced it. We are the new generation Latino, some American born, some born in America Latina, Spanglish speaking, ni de alli, ni de alla. Conceived in a coffee shop in Brooklyn, the series was created after our writers, actors, and producers grew tired seeing the same limited portrayals of Latinos featured in mainstream media. So instead, we took matters into our own hands, creating and distributing the series directly through the web to our community\u2026you.\nWe premiered our pilot season in April 2011 to give the world a taste of our vision and were overwhelmed with the enthusiastic response. From fans to bloggers to major new stations, the answer was clear, East WillyB\u2019s time was now. We received over 40,000 views within just 4 weeks of lauching and were covered by TV, print and online media ranging from CNN Espa\u00f1ol, Daily News, Fox News Latino, MTV, Latina.com and more.\nWe\u2019ve spent the last year learning from both the industry and our fans. We continued developing the show, traveling the country and sharing it with new audiences, Latinos and non-Latinos a like, and the one universal response has been: we want to see more episodes and please make them longer! We\u2019ve created a model for the series that allows for multiple distribution platforms including TV, online streaming, and VOD.That\u2019s where kickstarter comes in.\nWhy We Need Kickstarter: \nWe\u2019ve developed the series into a dream vision: 12 episode season, with episodes running 7-9 minutes in length. That is a 91 minute season equal to the length of a feature film! That\u2019s a hell of a lot of East WillyB for ya and this season is chock full of comedy and drama. It will leave you wanting even more! \nBut we need your help to make it a reality. The success of East WillyB has been due to the dedication of the creative team. Our creators, producers, production crew, social media maven, and talented cast have donated their time because they believe in the mission and vision of the series. But we cannot continue to expand on free labor alone.\nIn order to take the series to the next level and continue to provide the high quality programming that our fans demand of us, we need your financial support.\nBelow is a list of items that we are raising funds to cover:\nCrew\nCast\nCamera Equipment\nLighting Equipment\nSound Equipment\nMusic\nCraft Services\nWardrobe\nProduction Design\nLocations\nPost-Production\nPublicity/Marketing Costs\nThank you for checking out our Kickstarter page.  No contribution is too small. Any donation would help our project tremendously. Please share with your familia and friends. Let\u2019s show the world they\u2019ve been waiting for East WillyB.\nOn behalf of the East WillyB cast and crew, we would like to thank you all for your continued support! We hope to keep making you laugh as we bring you the bigger, badder, better Season 1 of East WillyB!\nFAQ\nDo you have to reach your goal? Yes. We need to reach or exceed our goal in order to keep any of the pledges for the film. If we don\u2019t reach our goal, no one will be charged for their pledge and it will be as if the whole thing never happened. It\u2019s all or nothing!\nWhat happens if you exceed the goal amount? The more the merrier. Seriously, making a 91 minute series is no small tasks, and even at $50,000 we will be pulling a lot of favors to make this happen. If we exceed our goal, it will help make the shooting process smoother and allow for better locations, costuming, music, you name it. Plus, it will help us market the series after its done.\nWhat\u2019s the release date? TBD. We\u2019d like to release the first episode September 2012, but that all depends on what happens next. We could get a TV deal, right?\nCan I give my reward as a gift? Yes, you can purchase a pledge and gift it to someone else. They will be notified about the gift and who it was from. We can even ship them their reward if you leave us a note.\nTo view the pilot season of East WillyB visit www.eastwillyb.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #23", "update_userinfo": "Final Rewards Mailing + East WillyB Nominated", "update_content": "We are so happy to share our trailer with our biggest fans and supporters - you!

It was about what you did. And I have no idea what is going to happen there. It's risky, unknown and awesome. I will be asking you to make things, to do things, and to surprise me. We will use the world as our playground and I have the technology to back it up. If I don't, I will make it. \nThe Plan\nTo start, I want to produce around three episodes a week for a year and take it from there. I want this to be fun and to last for a while. I figure that I will launch sometime at the end of March, near to the 6th anniversary of the original show.\nAll of the funds raised here will go towards the production of the show - equipment, salaries for people that will help me, rent. I will find other ways to pay myself. \nRewards: \nIf you have a thought for a reward that you don't see listed, send an email to ze@zefrank.com and I will see if I can include it.

I will tell you that I'll be crossing genres and time periods, and I think there will be a little something for everybody in the final product.\nI've been on a hiatus from the art world; clinical anxiety stopped me in my tracks. But now that I'm feeling better--- about everything--- I am so excited to re-enter the art scene with this particular project. I've had the idea in the back of my head for more than two years and I know it's time to get it out to where it can be seen by the world.

In Chapter One of LAMP, you are introduced to Lamp and Lux, two people who haven't spoken to each other in a very long time. One day Lux receives a package that she thinks can only have come from him. So, she decides to write him a letter. The only problem is, she doesn't know how or where to find him-- so she puts a message in a bottle, ties it to a balloon, and releases it into the sky.\nWhat happens next? I want you to be part of the story.\nEvery person who donates to the LAMP Kickstarter (to help turn the album and story into reality!) will be invited to submit their old love letters, and help create the backstory of Lamp and Lux. Additionally, I'm holding a balloon release event in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, where people (and maybe you!) will release one hundred of Lux's letters into the sky. Not in SF? No problem. I'll be documenting all the letters in the story and filming the event, so you can follow it through YouTube and through the website.\nMy minimum target goal to raise through Kickstarter is $3000-- which covers the bare minimum needed for mastering, album production, and part of the costs to create and film Chapter One. The more you donate and the more backers I have, the more you ensure there will be a Chapter Two and Chapter Three, and you get to see how this all ends. There are lots of rewards to choose from if you decide to support LAMP, and if I exceed my minimum goal, I'll begin introducing super special secret unlocked rewards.\nYou can listen to more of my music here: http://olganunes.bandcamp.com\nAnd you can see a special trailer for Chapter One of LAMP, including part of the first single, here: http://youtu.be/A-XZZq3jTa4\nThank you so much for your support, and tell your friends!

We first came together almost three years ago when we all participated in the 24 Hour Plays at the Atlantic Theater, hosted by Kevin Spacey, the Old Vic and the 24 Hour Company. And since then we've been busy - in addition to a producing a number of shows featuring the work of our multi-talented ensemble, we were named the official Off-Broadway company of the 24 Hour Plays and have produced two sold out 24 Hour Play fundraiser events featuring guest artists such as Ethan Hawke, Peter Dinklage, writer Jonathan Marc Sherman and acclaimed director Ron Daniels. And we wanna do another one...\nWhat We Do:\nSo what are the 24 Hour Plays? A group of writers, actors, directors and producers meet up one Sunday night, introduce themselves, share a prop and costume piece they've brought for inspiration, and then go home....well, all except for the writers that is. They stay up all night writing a play and bright and early next morning the directors and actors arrive, begin rehearsals, and the curtain rises at 8pm that same night (aided by the sleep deprived producers who've been running around like crazy making sure everything goes according to plan). It's a raucous, nerve-racking and absolutely exhilarating way to spend 24 hours.\nWhat We Need:\n$2500. Because even though all of our artists donate their time and energies gratis, producing even one night of theater ain't cheap. Your contributions will go towards things like theater rental, rehearsal space, meals...the vehicle and fuel for bringing our creative labors to fruition.\nJune 28th - Theater Row - help us make it happen!\nStill curious?

Check out some of the other great projects on Kickstarter\nDiaspora - the privacy aware, personally controlled, do-it-all distributed open source social network\nWe are four talented young programmers from NYU\u2019s Courant Institute trying to raise money so we can spend the summer building Diaspora; an open source personal web server that will put individuals in control of their data.\nWhat is it?\nEnter your Diaspora \u201cseed,\u201d a personal web server that stores all of your information and shares it with your friends. Diaspora knows how to securely share (using GPG) your pictures, videos, and more. When you have a Diaspora seed of your own, you own your social graph, you have access to your information however you want, whenever you want, and you have full control of your online identity. Once we have built a solid foundation, we will make Diaspora easy to extend to facilitate any type of communication, and the possibilities will be endless.\nFor a little more detailed explanation, checkout this blog post.\nWhat is the project about?\nWe believe that privacy and connectedness do not have to be mutually exclusive. With Diaspora, we are reclaiming our data, securing our social connections, and making it easy to share on your own terms. We think we can replace today's centralized social web with a more secure and convenient decentralized network. Diaspora will be easy to use, and it will be centered on you instead of a faceless hub.\nWhy are we building it?\nThis February, Eben Moglen, Columbia law professor and author of the latest GPL, gave a talk on Internet privacy. As more and more of our lives and identities become digitized, Moglen explains, the convenience of putting all of our information in the hands of companies on \u201cthe cloud\u201d is training us to casually sacrifice our privacy and fragment our online identities.\nBut why is centralization so much more convenient, even in an age where relatively powerful computers are ubiquitous? Why is there no good alternative to centralized services that, as Moglen pointed out, comes with \"spying for free?\u201d Why do we keep our personal data in a thousand places? We have the technology, someone just needs to take the time to figure out how we can communicate smoothly and intuitively, without the hidden costs of \u201cthe cloud\u201d. As good programmers, when we noticed that the application we need doesn't exist, we set out to fill the hole in our digital lives.\nWhy do we need money?\nWe have a plan, a bunch of ideas and the programming chops to build Diaspora. What we need is the time it takes to iron out a powerful, secure, and elegant piece of software. Daniel, Ilya, Raphael, and Maxwell are all ready to trade our internships and summer jobs for three months totally focused on building Diaspora. We want to write code all the time, everyday. Once we have made our first solid iteration, we are going to release our code as free software so everyone can make Diaspora even better. $10,000 buys the software for everyone who wants to use it, forever. We think it can change the way people communicate and empower individuals to permanently take control of their online identities.\nAfter we open source our source code, we hope to also provide a paid turnkey hosted service in the vein of Wordpress.com to make it easy for people who want to use Diaspora, but don\u2019t want to deal with the fuss of setting it up.* We will make it easy to export your data and configuration, so if you decide you want to graduate and host your seed yourself, you are free to do so at anytime.\nOur goal is for everyone to have full control over their data and to empower people in to become responsible, secure, and social Internet dwellers. We believe offering this service will be helpful to non-technical users who are also worried about their data and privacy online.\nOur Promise. We promise to you that Diaspora will be aGPL software which will released at the end of the summer.\nWant more info? Check out our website for project updates, blog posts, pictures, and plans.
