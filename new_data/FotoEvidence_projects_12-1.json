A place where they may rebuild their lives, overcome their adversity, & become positive members of the community. With 40,000 young people homeless each night in Australia, it is time we did something about it. #homesforhomelessyouth\nThe intention is to build a network of these homes across Australia in both the major cities as well as rural centres. Each home will house 4 youths with two live-in carers, together forming a family unit. The homes will be designed to provide an uplifting, light-filled, nurturing environment and will be a benchmark in sustainable design. Arranged in clusters of 4 homes distributed around a local community, further support would also be provided by a multi disciplinary team. \nConcept image of the courtyard - the heart of the home. Image derived from CJ5 house by Caramel Architekten\n Why are we seeking your support?\nWe are seeking funding to help us develop the concept design for these homes, starting with the first home. This is a key initial step and your contribution will help catalyse the project and enable the construction and delivery of these homes. \nWe will keep you posted on the progress of the project as we move from design to construction of the first home and the many more to come. If our fundraising target is exceeded, these funds will be used to progress further phases of the project.\nInitial concept sketch plan\n Who are we?\nUrban Creative is an architecture and urban design studio based in Melbourne founded by Andrew Milward-Bason and Greg Pitts who have over 25 years experience between them (find out more at www.urbancreativestudio.com.au). Having worked across a range of award winning projects in Australia and internationally, Greg and Andrew established Urban creative with a focus on urban intensification and sustainable infill development, and a passion for pursuing best outcomes for the community.\nRewards\n                   Why Contribute?\nThe potential for positive change is enormous - not only for individual youths but for the wider community as they make the journey from being in crisis to contributing positively to the community. \nMost of us can remember a time in our lives where we could have used a helping hand \u2013 this is your chance to be that hand. \n\nRebuilding lives together", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur clients operate a number of homes and the model of care for the young people in these homes has been proven through years of experience. The program has been highly successful, with a number of youths now leading independent lives, and often choosing to have an ongoing relationship with the program, offering support and inspiration to the next generation of youths. \n\nWhat they have not had yet is a bespoke design tailored to their model of care. This would enormously facilitate the success of the program and give youths entering the program the best chance and conditions to thrive.\n\nThe key hurdle is to secure a backer or backers to help deliver the dwellings. This is where the concept design comes in - it is a key mechanism to achieve this objective. \n\nIn terms of deployment, the intention is to pilot the project with a single home first, monitor the success and lessons learned, and move on to a constructing a cluster of 4 homes in the area. Following this, the model is able to be rolled out across any number of locations - wherever they are most useful.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #8", "update_userinfo": "Kickstarter Rewards", "update_content": "Hi All\nBy now everyone who responded to the survey sent out in December should have received your rewards in the mail.\nThe official thank you on our website has also gone up today with a full list of backers to show our appreciation.

We are approaching this on two fronts.  \nFirstly, we aim to create a prototypical approach to the design - a flexible strategy for the design that can be easily adapted to different sites, orientations, and construction methodologies. The second part of this concept development is to have a tangible product that larger corporate or private investors can see. Having a design that fosters both confidence and excitement is a critical step in raising the funds to build these houses.

From the shores of the Black Sea to the endless Kazakh steppe, the bus stops show the range of public art from the Soviet era and give a rare glimpse into the creative minds of the time.

These projects became a precious opportunity for local artists and architects to express themselves. Instead of one standardized design we find 1000\u2019s of unique and sometimes whimsical creations. They represent a mix of styles, shapes and sizes, from swirling tile mosaic pieces, to elegant geometric forms, to miniature temples of symbolist expression.\nTHE BOOK \u2013 hardcover, landscape A4 \u2013 128 pages\n\u201cA book of Soviet bus stops?

Pre-order your copy of this limited edition book now and make this project a reality.\nTHE JOURNEY AND THE OBSESSION\nBy chance I discovered a phenomenon that set in motion a photographic journey that would span 12 years and 13 countries. Hunting for the most amazing road side bus shelters in the former Soviet Union would become my muse and my reason to travel.\nDuring a cycling trip from London to St. Petersburg in the autumn of 2002 I set myself a photographic challenge to take one good photo every hour. It was on this trip that I first paid attention to the bus stops. The long hours in the saddle and slowly changing landscape along country roads in Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and Russia provided the setting for my discovery and the birth of my obsession. Here the designs mainly played with purely graphic shapes, each different stretch of road revealing a new set of creations to break up an otherwise bleak landscape.\nBetween 2003 and 2006 I lived in Kazakhstan, and I explored the five \u2018Stan\u2019 countries and former Soviet states of Central Asia: Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan. Along these silk routes I found more fascinating bus stops, often appearing in the middle of the desert, steppe or countryside, with no other sign of human settlement in sight. It was as if the earth was its pedestal and nothing else on the endless horizon could compete with the bold statement it was making.\nKyrgyzstan, Armenia, Abkhazia\nMy obsession grew and saw me hit the road further to visit five more former soviet countries: Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, Armenia, and the breakaway region of Abkhazia, and later to revisit the Baltics, travelling thousands more kilometres by bus, rental car and taxi with the specific task of hunting down the very best bus stops. I was possessed. On a mission. Nothing was going to deter me from my hunt. I searched travellers\u2019 blogs for clues, interrogated bus and taxi drivers and even scanned over the roads on Google Earth to plan what I believed would be most effective routes. I was not disappointed as each new discovery pushed to outshine the previous.\nSeveral of these countries have little freedom of press and expression. Tourists are rare. Visas for photographers were hard to come by. I often had to instead go into the countries on tourist visas. Despite my efforts not to arouse suspicion I was, on several occasions, accused of being a spy and only narrowly avoided getting caught up in something rather awkward. With reluctance this added to the adventure and made each new discovery even more precious. In Abkhazia my driver accused me of being a Georgian agent and photographing sensitive material. He demanded a bribe, otherwise, it would be \u201cstraight to the militizia and a firing squad\u201d. Needless to say, he was not convinced by my story that \u201cI have only come to your country to see your pretty bus stops\u201d. I was happy to escape from the journey with relatively little drama, and even happier to have captured some of the most beautifully insane bus stops I had ever encountered, safe on a memory card tucked into my underpants.\nThis photo series is likely the largest collection of Soviet Bus Stops ever assembled. A tenuous claim to fame, I admit, and a strange obsession to have. But still, it\u2019s one that I am proud of and I hope it will help to preserve this unique and historical art form.\nSigned Archival Prints", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe greatest challenge of finding the bus stops and taking the photos is done.

I'll have to determine how many, and what the formula is, after the project closes.\nI am 71. I have resided in Southern California since 1995. My lifelong passion for photography dates way back to my youth in New York. In my youth as a NYC street photographer, I shot John Lennon (a magical afternoon), Woody Allen (he was funny back then), and many others. But I didn't feel I was producing art. As I completed my education and began to hone my own style, I learned to seek and shoot people, objects, and scenes that carried more personal meaning; I began to give these images my own interpretation. My photography has been featured in over 30 gallery exhibitions and I've received a measure of positive acclaim. I can't really say why I never compiled a book, despite much urging of friends and associates. I think the process of doing it seemed daunting. But I made plans to finally do so in 2008 and those plans were laid to waste, literally, when a fire attacked and consumed my home. I lost so much, including over 90% of my first 30 years of images. I wallowed for a bit, but thankfully soon rose above the despair, and set upon the task of re-creating the lost images most dear to me; to do it right, this took years. \nI hope that you can take the time to read the more complete story, below. \nI have separated the rest of this narrative into 5 parts so you can easily scroll up and down to the parts that matter to you most;  these are: Background; Project Specifics - Budget and Goals; My Photography; The Story; and About Me. \n===\nBACKGROUND: I am a photo-holic who got hooked on photography at a young age.  Over time, my work became well received. I was featured in many public showcases and one-man gallery exhibitions, and my photographs hang on some pretty impressive walls. Despite the prodding of many close to me, I never compiled and published a collection ... until now. \nA 50-year library would naturally include many works from the pre-digital \"film age\". In 2008, I dedicated my basement to the arduous task of finally digitizing this work. I spent countless hours getting it done. On July 3, 2008, I awoke in the middle of the night to a raging fire. There was no time for anything but survival. Later that morning, my basement was no more; a couple of hours after that, the house had burned completely to the ground. (See \"The Story\", below). \nI passed through self-pity and despondency. I had lost all my possessions - being uninsured like a fool. But truthfully - truthfully - only the loss of the 30 years of non-digitized photos and their negatives mattered. It's how I defined myself. So it was like I lost a piece of myself. \nThankfully, I was soon able to channel the anger into defiance, and I picked myself up, as if to rise from those ashes (metaphorically speaking). I spent the next several years faithfully re-creating some of my most cherished lost photographs, tapping into memory and soul. I am proud to present them in this - my first-ever book, accompanied by narrative, along with many other photographs they've inspired. \nThe title - IMAGES ... From the Ashes - relates both to the fire that destroyed decades of my life's work, as well as my resolve to \"rise above it\". \nI've shared some of the story in the video, and in far greater detail below. \nPROJECT SPECIFICS - BUDGET AND GOALS: The monies I seek to raise ($24,000) will allow me to reach these goals: to complete the compilation and publishing/printing of a very special limited-run collector's edition version of the book, AND to produce larger-scale renderings and didactic panels necessary for three featured gallery exhibitions showcasing work from the book. \nBOA Gallery in West Hollywood has graciously committed to hosting the initial month-long exhibition. After the LA showcase, I've also got gallery commitments in New York and Toronto. (I sometimes think forward to that Opening Night gala at BOA, and feel that it will be THE crowning validation of a heartfelt process. I cannot wait; hope you can make it.) \nIf we exceed targeted funds, I will tour the live exhibition to additional cities, and perhaps exhibit at a few juried fine arts festivals. And if I need to print more books, I will - BUT - I will not print nor number more collector's edition copies - this is a finite, limited run, forever. I will add more definitive \"stretch goals\" after we see how it progresses.\nThe book will be high quality, hard cover, coffee table variety;  9 x 12 page size, horizontal; there will be 12 sections (or categories) overall, such as Light Studies and Abstracts; one of 10 re-imagined photos (or re-creations) will lead each of the first 10 sections with storyline text about each; it will be approximately 112 pages; there will be some additional narrative at the end of each section because I want to share my work in the context of my story, which is largely what this is about. The printing will be in the U.S. \nThe budget includes: approximately $9,000 for a press run of 300 high quality books - again, each of them hand-signed and numbered; $2,800 to reimburse my awesome team of copywriter ($1,000); graphic designer ($1,200), and videographer ($600) - thanks so much, guys, for working with me on the come; $4,000 for the production needed for the initial gallery showcase; $1,500 for each of the other two showcases (mostly covering cost of travel as I anticipate sales from the first showcase - which is in my hometown of LA - to offset the production costs needed for the second and third showcases). The rest of the budget covers kickstarter fees, Amazon fees, miscellaneous fulfillment costs, shipping, and a small contingency. \nI have indicated on some tiers that shipping will be included within the U.S. only, while I added new tiers with global shipping; however I do encourage non-U.S. persons thinking of backing to reach out to me to discuss. \nBelow is more about my photography, with samples. After that is the more detailed story which has spawned this project. \nMY PHOTOGRAPHY:\nMy earliest work was often defined by overlapping shades of grey, and early reviewers commented favorably on the clarity I was able to garner from dark grey images taken close to dusk.\n\"This is a re-creation of my favorite photo. The original was an eagle landing on a jutting precipice. This bird landing on a lamppost mirrors the preciseness of the moment, the contrasting shades of grey, and the bird's concentration as it lands.\"\nLeft: from the Abstract category; Right: a Decisive Moment\nLeft: from Light Studies; Right: from Favorites\nLeft: the oldest surviving photo, taken in 1963, category of Reflections; Right: taken 50 years later as I began experimenting with mixing B&W and Color\nLeft: from the Impressions category; Right: a Favorite\nLike the bird (above), this is a Re-Creation. In the 80's, I overexposed bright colors on the beach in my darkroom. These brightly colored kayaks re-create that effect.\nAbove and below: I went through a phase of trying to trick the eye ...\nBicycle in front of a mural on Venice Beach.\nThe paint peels ... the woman bleeds. What has she seen?\nA street in St. Tropez - recognize the \"siren of the 60's\"?\nTHE STORY: On July 3, 2008, I awoke in the middle of the night with a start. To this day, I don\u2019t know if I heard something, smelled something, or maybe it was just simply one of those eerie premonitions that comes from a place all its own. There was an orange glow. And while we had experienced many shades of the color orange since Peggy and I made our home renting a modest place on the beautiful Malibu beachfront, I never before saw orange at 3:30AM, that's for sure! The orange began to dip and dive and I soon realized my neighbor\u2019s house was fully ablaze. My first inclination when I see anything stark, significant or profound is to go get my camera to document the moment. I thought about it, but no way - there was no time. I heard the fire crackle as it quickly headed in our direction. I woke up Peggy, she grabbed the dog and we stopped for nothing. Less than a minute from the time I awoke, we opened the front door to exit, and thick grey smoke billowed and poured inside. We just closed our eyes, took a deep breath, and ran blindly through the smoke. We never came back. On the way out, there was a small bag, fortuitously left on the path to the front door, which contained disks comprising my digital library of photographs. I am thankful for that. But nothing else of any nature survived, and the basement was no more. The fire was fierce, destroying everything in its path. It even melted the computer hard drives. Peggy is the more grounded one of us, a practicing Buddhist. After months of kicking myself over the loss (and the insurance lapse, which buried me economically), she impressed upon me two things - that I should be thankful I had awakened when I did, and that I needed to stop feeling sorry myself and get \"in the now\" and do something proactive and constructive. I may not listen to reason right away, but I do eventually. :) \nIMAGES \u2026 From the Ashes \u2026 pays homage to some of what was lost through its inclusion of select photographic re-imaginings. I took 10 photos that were most forever etched in my brain and heart, and did my best to faithfully duplicate their nature, import, and intent, and included a explanatory narrative about each. I call these the \"Re-Creations\". I then grouped other images based upon their categorical and inspirational relevance to each re-creation. Categories in this book include Decisive Moments, Reflections, Abstracts, Light Studies, and Favorites; each re-creation comes with a story; and each category concludes with further explanation and notes. \nABOUT ME: I have had a long career in entertainment (first in publishing and then in producing films - see BIO). I am the Einstein-like genius who conceived of a film where Sylvester Stallone would sing country (for which one critic said \"I saw it on an airplane and walked out\".)  But nothing has ever fulfilled my innate desire to be creative and expressive like a camera. I recently turned 71 and while I am grateful for health, the love of a wonderful woman, two great kids, and three precious grandchildren, I am also one of those people who finds it difficult to sit idle. I am happiest when engaged in the processes of capturing moments and enhancing images. Through the 5 decades of my adult life, my photographs have mirrored my moods and perceptions, and told tales of my life experience. Then the fire happened, and you've read the rest by now. \nSo I'll just add this: This is the most personal work of any kind I have ever endeavored to compile. I feel it simultaneously presents my art while it also acknowledges a Great Paradox - that there is sometimes a futility to existence, yet against that futility, the indomitability of the human spirit can prevail - you just have to get out of your rut and give it a fighting chance. The re-created photographs come from memory and soul, and shepherding their evolution into a reborn reality has been cathartic and joyful for me. The added irony that I was finally compiling a book after decades of requests when the fire struck, makes me feel like this project somehow has meaning that transcends me. So I think that whereas other books may someday also present work, this book will always come closest to presenting life. I also like to think that maybe there is a moral here - not to wax sentimental or too much over the top - but I think there is truth to the fact that all physical possessions and manifestations are transient in the end, whereas our innermost thoughts, feelings and memories are forever. \nThank you again for sharing a slice of your valuable time.\nBilly Blake\nAnyone wishing to comment or converse can find me at bblakela@aol.com. \n===\nTop - I stood back from PCH and took this shot while the fire raged.

The money raised by this campaign will go directly towards the costs of printing and shipping 400 copies of the book.\nThe book is called America: Witnessed, and it is my attempt at making sense of American culture in the first part of the 21st century.\nHaving been raised in Western Kentucky and living my entire adult life in New York City, I am familiar with the greatly different perspectives that make up this process that we call American democracy, a process that can seem so incompatible at times. This project began as an attempt to introduce these two very different worlds to one another. By the beginning of 2012, I\u2019d been photographing for more than 10 years when I decided I needed to expand the project. So, last spring, I travelled for 6 weeks, without my wife or a paycheck. I drove over 10,000 miles, across 26 states, and burned over 300 gallons of gasoline. I spent almost every evening in bars and diners, meeting the people in these places and trying to find out what life was like there. I was looking for answers, but mostly I only discovered more questions. This book is my interpretation of all those miles travelled, all of those places seen, and all of those people that I met.\nThe creative work for this project is finished. After returning from my trip in April, I spent the rest of the year, and up until now, editing and sequencing all of these photographs from the last 11 years. I've worked with an incredible designer named Francesca Richer, and the book is ready to go to press.\nThis project has been completely self-funded up until now, and I need your help to make this book a reality.\nThe book will be printed in a limited edition of 400. It will contain 48 photographs, and an essay by the one and only Duane Michals.\nYou can see a portfolio of the images here: http://americawitnessed.com\nFor a $100 pledge, you\u2019ll receive the book, plus a special edition 8\" x 10\" archival pigment print of the image on the cover of the book.
