[{"backer": "Black Candle Games", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Engage in power struggles and build your crew\u2019s reputation. Salvage and steal to survive and endure a ruthless universe. And above all, do anything you can to get that next job.\nThis sci-fi tabletop roleplaying game takes you to the grimy blue-collar future of a universe filled with risk, but also opportunity. DEATH IN SPACE presents a vision of space where technology is broken and dirty, and society is harsh and desperate. The player characters make up a crew with their own spacecraft or station, and take on the jobs they can find, in order to earn some well-needed bucks and get ahead in the power struggles of the stellar system. \nThe people making this game are Christian Plogfors and Carl Niblaeus of Stockholm Kartell. With this Kickstarter, we hope to get the funds to print the core book for the game, which should contain everything you need to start playing. We want to continue making material for the game after the game is out, in the form of adventures and other material to use in your game. \nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter or on the website. \n\nHere's a preview of what we hope the standard edition of the book will look like (the holographic foil is stretchgoal-dependent):\nDEATH IN SPACE has its roots in the OSR scene, and follows similar design principles. In terms of setting and tone, inspiration comes primarily from the gritty science fiction of films like Outland and Prospect, classic westerns and the grimy future of early 80\u2019s science fiction movies. \nIt is a game about adventure and uncertain journeys out into the darkness of space, it is about you and your crew making a home of your spacecraft or station, in tough competition with everyone else, and most of all, it is about enduring in an abandoned frontier system where your only hope of surviving is to take any contract you can find, sometimes having to put your fate in your enemies' hands.\nInspiration\nThere are a lot of great and inspiring games out there. In terms of rules and approach, we have found inspiration in some form, large or small, in for example the following games (alphabetically listed): Coriolis, Into the Odd, Knave, Mothership, Mutant Year Zero, M\u00d6RK BORG, Offworlders, Solar Blades & Cosmic Spells, Mutant  (1989 edition), Traveller. Out of these, M\u00d6RK BORG, Knave and Coriolis deserve a special mention.\nMost of the inspiration for the tone and feel comes from movies and series. Some of these, that have inspired elements of the setting in one way or another, are (alphabetically listed): 2001: A Space Odyssey, A Fistful of Dollars, Alien, Blade Runner, Escape from New York, The Expanse, Firefly, IO, Moon, Outland, Prospect, Sunshine, Total Recall, The Warriors. \nVisually, much of the inspiration comes from abstract geometric art and design, and old computer interfaces and manuals.\n\nIn terms of music, one of our stretchgoals consists of a dedicated soundtrack for the game, by our musician collaborator Helium Kid Kanon. You can already listen to a preview of what that will sound like on Spotify (or scroll down to the stretchgoal list and listen immediately). \n\n\nStandard edition with holographic foil (not final)\nKickstarter exclusive edition (not final)\nOur main goal is to print a durable book of excellent quality that is easy to use at the table. We aim for an offset printed book with a sewn binding and possibly some fancy extras, depending on which stretchgoals are funded.\nThe book should land at about 128 pages and measure 6 by 9 inches. You can choose from two cover versions: the standard cover, and a special edition, only available in the Kickstarter.\nRegarding the covers, we plan for the special edition to be a cloth bound book, and the regular edition cover to be embellished with holographic foil (the silvery kind with reflecting colors), if we fund the corresponding stretchgoal (otherwise, the holographic parts will be a solid color). Apart from that, there are more possible upgrades to the book in stretchgoals. Basically, we don\u2019t want to pull any punches, and will try to make this as nice a book as possible.\nContentwise, the core rulebook contains everything you need to start playing immediately:\n Light-weight rules, intended to be easy to use and quick to learn\n  A system for quickly generating player characters and their spacecraft or space-station\n   60+ different modules to make the spacecraft or space-station your own\n  An introduction to the default setting, the Tenebris stellar system, its main locations and history (with many pieces of the puzzle left for you to fill in)\n  A system for repairs, where you collect spare parts to repair your stuff\n   20 cosmic mutations, representing physical manifestations of the void through your body\n  A system for spacecraft confrontations and boarding\n  An introductory scenario to jumpstart your campaign\n   40+ tables and generators packed with setting flavor\nBelow are some preliminary spreads to give you a flavor of how the interior of the book will look like:\nThe rules of DEATH IN SPACE are intended to be easy to use and hack but also to support and introduce the setting through the rules. While inspired by OSR games, the primary intent is not to be fully compatible with the rulesets and modules of old, but rather to try to capture the quickness and simplicity of these rulesets, tweak them according to our preferences and add some setting flavor (however, the rules are still close enough to other OSR rulesets that material should be possible to use with some simple conversions).\nThe basic rule when you try to accomplish something, say force open an airlock, or resist the effects of strange radiation, is to roll a d20 modified by one of four ability values, the ability determined by the nature of the task. If you roll over a fixed difficulty, you succeed. Failing checks gives you void points that you can use to increase your chances the next time you attempt something. Beware of saving up too many though, that might result in some nasty consequences. Void points are also used to activate cosmic mutations, strange powers from the void. \nThe player characters are all part of a crew with their own spacecraft or space-station, their sanctuary in a dangerous universe. Characters are generated in a quick randomized fashion, making it quick to make a new one when (not if)  your character suffers an accident. With a list of 60+ modules that provide new possibilities, the players can successively customize their ship or station and really make it their home and base of their adventures. If your ship or gear should break, you can repair it as soon as you collect the necessary spare parts. In case you encounter rivals on your travels, the rules for spacecraft confrontations determine the outcome and whether you can avoid being boarded.\nDEATH IN SPACE focuses on the Tenebris system\u2014a system of planets and objects revolving around the star Tenebris. It is a stellar system ravaged by war and strife, where a greed-fueled mining for precious gems ended in a conflict that laid waste to the intricate trade networks that ensured technological production. With no new parts to find, almost every single object built today, from weapon to spacecraft, is put together from discarded, salvaged or stolen parts. Nothing is new.\nAs if rebuilding the system after the war was not enough, there are reports from stargazing cosmologists that the universe has stopped expanding, and that it has instead begun collapsing at an accelerating rate. The news that civilization is at its end have created a sense of hopelessness and disorder, and in many sectors of the system former vassals have taken this chance to seize control from distant rulers.\nPlayer spacecraft concept by Mattias Astenvald\nIn the heart of the Tenebris system is the Iron Ring\u2014a huge, ring-like structure surrounding the moon Inauro like a belt of metal. This is the center of activity in the Tenebris system, and here miners and salvagers huddle in cramped living quarters, waiting for their next contract and a chance to earn some much needed money. In other parts of the Ring, far from the bustling market-places and common areas, there are dark, empty sectors, where shady types hide from attention.\nAmong the people of the Iron Ring, cryptic rumors are spreading about a void accelerating the collapse. A void that whispers strange sentences to the unlucky through the ever present thick static noise that grows stronger and stronger as you travel towards the edge of civilization. A void that infects and corrupts and imbues their bodies with odd powers.\nIn the middle of all this are the player characters: hard-working explorers and laborers hoping for a big score.\nThe 99% Void Safe reward level\nVoid protection. With this reward level you get the core book in print, with the cover of your choice (regular or special edition). The book will be wrapped in foil, to keep it safe from the strange void radiation. Better safe than sorry. \nThis is a mockup and not the final product.\nT-shirt. Premium cotton t-shirt from Spreadshirt. We're aiming for a design based on the book cover.\nHandouts. Two maps for the adventure in the core book\u2014Welcome to the Ring\u2014printed on high quality paper. \nStickers. One prismatic sticker portraying the spacecraft by Mattias Astenvald, and one holographic sticker using the graphics from the standard cover. These designs are exclusive for the Kickstarter. Below are preliminary designs.\nSetting location and printed note. We create a location connected to the Iron Ring\u2014an establishment, a station, spacecraft or similar\u2014and dedicate it to you. The locations are planned to be included in a table in the book. You get an individually crafted and printed thank-you letter that also includes the location name and description. \n50000 SEK \u2013 We make this book \nA high-quality offset printed 128-page book including all you need to start playing.\n75000 SEK \u2013 Holographic foil cover\nWe add holographic foil to the regular book cover and make this book glimmer.\n100000 SEK \u2013 Soundtrack\nWe ask our musician collaborator Helium Kid Kanon to make a full-length soundtrack for DEATH IN SPACE, that you can use as background music for your games. Every backer gets the soundtrack digitally, and it will also be made available on Spotify and Bandcamp. Here is how Helium Kid Kanon describes the soundscape for DEATH IN SPACE:\n\"Sound waves from dark, vibrating aegrine were found on a 570 million year old, volcanic island. When passed through a cloud chamber, they turn into an oozing, analog warmth, layered with sparkles of cosmic noise. These are some of the parts, arranged into a multi layered space. A composition that can trigger chronesthesia. The soundscape for DEATH IN SPACE.\"\n 150000 SEK \u2013 Pamphlet adventure\nWe make a pamphlet adventure. All backers get it in pdf form and we include it in print with all rewards except Orbit Vagabond and Event Horizon Diver.\n200000 SEK \u2013 More illustrations\nWe add more spacecraft illustrations by artist Mattias Astenvald to the book.\n250000 SEK \u2013 Map poster\nWe make a map poster of the Tenebris system. For the map, we will receive some help from graphic designer and animator Gabriel Herrin. Gabriel did some work on the movie Prospect \u2013 one of the big sources of inspiration for DEATH IN SPACE \u2013 so we are very happy to have him onboard! All backers get it in pdf form and we include it in print with all rewards except Orbit Vagabond and Event Horizon Diver. Note that logos are placeholders and will be replaced.\n300000 SEK \u2013 Bookmark ribbon \nWe add a bookmark ribbon to the book, to make it easier to find the page you\u2019re always flipping to.   \n350000 SEK \u2013 More illustrations\nWe add even more spacecraft illustrations by our artist Mattias Astenvald to the book.\n500000 SEK \u2013 New adventure\nWe ask Rickard Antroia to write an adventure for us. The adventure will be released in pdf and all backers get it digitally. Rickard is a writer and designer who has written adventures for Coriolis and Tales from the Loop and worked with editing on Tales from the Loop, Things from the Flood, Vaesen and Alien RPG. He wants to take you on an epic journey to the edge of the universe.\n700000 SEK \u2013 Cults and factions\nPelle Nilsson - from Ockult \u00d6rtm\u00e4stare Games, author of games such as M\u00d6RK BORG and Barkh\u00e4xan among others, contributes to the game by providing a number of cults or factions of the Tenebris system that you can use in your game.\n\n800000 SEK \u2013 Online generator \nWe ask Karl Druid to make an online character generator for us. Karl writes material and makes virtual paraphernalia for tabletop RPGs. He is for example behind the M\u00d6RK BORG online generators scvmbirther and dngngen.  \n\n900000 SEK \u2013 Printed pamphlet #2 \nWe print the adventure pamphlet by Rickard Antroia from the 500k stretch goal. All backers with physical reward levels get it (all reward levels except Orbit Vagabond and Event Horizon Diver). This means that if you get the printed book, you get two different printed adventure pamphlets with it.\n\n1,100,000 SEK \u2013 Solar Fields song and Tenebris system soundscape\nMagnus Birgersson, also known under the name Solar Fields, will write and produce a track inspired by the material included in the book! Solar Fields has released 17 albums and appeared in over 60 compilations, including the in-game scores for the computer games Mirror's Edge and Mirror's Edge Catalyst. You can find his music on Spotify and on other platforms.   \nIn addition, if we pass this stretchgoal, Helium Kid Kanon will create a number of immersive soundscapes that represent various locations and environments in the Tenebris system. A perfect background to amplify your experience while exploring our world.  \nThe songs for the soundtrack and the soundscapes will be published on streaming platforms like Spotify, and backers get them digitally.\nThe majority of the money we collect will fund the printing cost for the book and any other funded print material. The remaining funds will be used to pay our collaborators for their work and costs. \nDEATH IN SPACE will be published by Free League Workshop, Free League Publishing's sublabel for externally designed games. They are responsible for shipping and distribution.\nWe plan to use a pledge manager, and charge shipping separately after the campaign has ended. See the map for our current best estimates of shipping costs*. The current plan is to ship the game from the UK as the default, but with distribution hubs in the EU and US as well. \n* This is based on shipping one book, the map and a pamphlet, and the Moon Outlaw and 99% Void Safe reward levels may therefore incur some extra shipping charges\n\nChristian Plogfors. When he is not writing for DEATH IN SPACE, Christian spends the rest of his time on the layout and graphics for the game. He has been designing worlds for computer games for 18 years, now as a senior level designer, and has contributed to games such as Battlefield, Mirror\u2019s Edge and Star Wars Battlefront. When relaxing, he likes to write material for his Into the Odd hack Into the Jungle. He has also contributed with material and layout for the Night Yeast zine.\nCarl Niblaeus. While almost every sentence of the game has been dissected by both Carl and Christian, Carl has had the last word on much of the language in the book. In the RPG world, Carl has contributed to M\u00d6RK BORG zine Feretory, the Night Yeast zine, and released one or two old school modules before that. He also helps running the so-called Old School Corner (\u201cOld School-h\u00f6rnan\u201d) at GothCon, Sweden\u2019s largest RPG con. There he referees his own and others\u2019 creations. Outside of RPGs, Carl has a PhD in astroparticle physics, and has spent many years researching the underpinnings of our own universe. In DEATH IN SPACE, this knowledge is used to inspire the creation of another.\nCollaborators\nApart from us there are a number of collaborators who provide invaluable assistance in making the game.\nJohan Nohr. As one half of the team behind M\u00d6RK BORG, Johan should be well-known to many in our audience. With M\u00d6RK BORG, he works tirelessly to make it look as great as it does, and we are very happy to have him onboard. In DEATH IN SPACE, Johan has worked with the illustrations, adding touches to give them a more personal feel.\nMattias Astenvald. Mattias is an artist located in Uppsala, Sweden, working in the digital gaming industry. For our game, he helps make reality of our spacecraft and we hope to make use of his great skills as much as we can. \nGabriel Herrin. Seattle-based graphic designer and animator. Gabriel did some work on the movie Prospect, which is one of the big sources of inspiration for DEATH IN SPACE, so we're really happy have him onboard. He will help us make company logos for the map poster. Check out more of his stuff here.\nStockholm Kartell is a creative coven of writers, designers and idiots.

The game content is at the launch of the campaign about 90% complete, and we foresee no major changes after the campaign. After the campaign we want to spend about 2 months finalising the last few details before doing a proper round of editing and proofreading with a native English speaker. Our plan is then to deliver the game to the printer in September, which should provide enough time for the game to be in your hands by January 2022. \n\nGiven the experience of Free League Publishing, we feel confident that printing, stocking and shipping will be in safe hands, and we will do our utmost to make sure that you will have your books by January!

Most of it is created by our wonderful community and will be (or already is) made available for free download on morkborg.com, but there is also exclusive official material.\nIn this Kickstarter is also the official M\u00d6RK BORG GM screen, and a box full of almost-forgotten gods. \n\n\u2716 Thank you Terra Tenebrosa for letting us use the track The Arc of Descent from the album The Tunnels in the Kickstarter video. If you're looking for feverous, experimental black/post-metal, check it out here. \nThis is what this godless tome will look like\nPunish your ears\nTo get into the proper mood, we created this Spotify playlist. Put it on while reading this Kickstarter, and/or when playing M\u00d6RK BORG.\n\u2716 M\u00d6RK BORG is a blackened artpunk doomsday RPG about miserable bastards and heretics enduring a bleak, dying world. It's a doom metal album of a game. A spiked flail to the face. Rules light, heavy everything else. It's made by Pelle Nilsson of Ockult \u00d6rtm\u00e4stare Games and Johan Nohr from Stockholm Kartell, and published by Free League Publishing. Check it out here, you might like it.\nSome people said this\n\n\u2716 M\u00d6RK BORG CULT (MBC) is our sub-label for selected, approved and curated M\u00d6RK BORG content by the community. Basically, you send us homebrew stuff and if we like it and it follows our guidelines, we make some edits, art and lay it out before publishing it for free download on morkborg.com. Digital MBC content (including that of zines like this) will always be free, but this is a chance to get some of it in high-quality print form. I mean, you can download the content for free and print it at home too if you want. \n\u2716 Since a few days ago, we are also putting the submissions to MBC on pause. When we started this project we had NO IDEA we would receive as much content as we are, and since we're also working on forthcoming books etc, we simply can't keep up with the demand. So we close it down for a bit, until we've cleared the backlog, at which point we can open it up again.  \n\n\u2716 About six months ago we Kickstarted M\u00d6RK BORG CULT: FERETORY, the first MBC zine. It was a much bigger success than we could have imagined and an unbelievable 1792 backers helped us realize the project. Since then we have received a TON of awesome content submitted to the Cult and we want to collect it into a physical zine once more. So, if you're familiar with MBC: FERETORY, you know the drill. This is pretty much the exact same thing. Oh, and there's also the Official M\u00d6RK BORG Game Master's Screen of Doom and the mysterious shrine IKHON. We'll get to that. \nM\u00d6RK BORG CULT: HERETIC is published by Free League Publishing, same as M\u00d6RK BORG and M\u00d6RK BORG CULT: FERETORY was. They will handle printing, distribution and digital fulfillment.\n  All these either are or will be available for free download on morkborg.com\n Adventure: Graves Left Wanting. The PCs find themselves buried alive in the vast, ever-changing cemetery of Graven-Tosk. This dark and weird tombcrawl is suitable as a campaign starter or a post-TPK adventure. By Karl Druid \n Adventure: Sepulchre of the Swamp Witch. In a hidden repository deep in the Slithering Swamp is a witch's altar of glyph-covered roots. They say it can fulfill any wish. Could stopping the approaching Doom be within its powers? Only one way to find out. By Christian Sahl\u00e9n. \n Adventure: Bloat. Villagers disappear. Tracks lead to an underground temple of bacchanalian frenzy, reeking of rot, offal and bile. Find them and sate your hunger. By Greg Saunders. \n Rules: Unheroic Feats. Enhance and personalize your classless characters with these optional advancement rules. By Johnny Carhat. \n Class: Sacrilegious Songbird. You struck a deal with a devil and since that woeful day your soul screams but your throat sings sweetly. And so does your purse. A small price to pay. By Karl Druid. \n Class: Shedding Vicar. Armor is weak, clothes a sin and your very skin an abhorrent vanity. Best to remove it all and walk peeled, clean and glistening wet into the night. By Cameron James. \n Creature: The Merchant. Cursed with eternal life and destined to roam the world trading shards of souls for ruinous relics. You never know when this mysterious monger might appear. Will you make a deal? By Johnny Carhat. \n Creature: The Bone Bowyer. This horrid fey lurks in the tangled depths of Sarkash where it fashions heart-seeking bone bows and blood-dyed cloaks from the flesh of the lost. By Matthew Bottiglieri. \n Rules: Blackpowder Weapons for the Rich and Foolhardy. The world is ending, so let's end it with a BANG. These optional rules are the spark that adds fire- to your fights. Whether it's a pepperbox or a ribauldequin, you can be assured these things are loud and deadly. By Ian McClung. \n\nThese are exclusive to the zine and will not be made available for free download. These will not only be included in the printed zine, but will also come translated to Swedish as a digital appendix to the PDF version. \n Creature: Borg Bitor. Vile, insectoid, parasitic creatures creeping into houses and nurseries come nighttime. There is a baby. There is an egg. Don't let them become one.\n Creature: Rotting Nurse. Many a Galgenbeckian remembers Mikol's infirmary and its gruesome experiments exposed by the inquisition. The head surgeon was jailed but whatever really happened to his accomplices, the nurses? Their lengthy, cruel punishment and vivisepulture. The empty graves. The shimmer from the starless skies. The many-legged horses carrying the bodies away... for what purpose?  \n 250.000 SEK STRETCH GOAL Adventure: Nurse the Rot. As you put Mother Marathuk\u2014the aunt of one of you dregs\u2014to her final rest, the village Tunstal is set in complete darkness, leaving it to its doom unless something is done. \n Rules: Curses and Cures. So you opened the puzzle box, whistled in the old mine or carelessly removed the protecting wards? These curses will be the consequence. Luckily, there are ways to break them, but it comes at a cost. \n\n\u2716 Our goal is to make this zine similar to M\u00d6RK BORG CULT: FERETORY, meaning something quite different from the M\u00d6RK BORG  core book. This is a rough zine, a haphazardly composited collection of ideas and articles, and we want it to feel like something you'd pick up at a concert or an underground art fair. It'll be a soft-cover zine, about 60-ish A5 pages thick, printed on heavily textured uncoated paper in 7 colors (CMYK+3), with some extra things metallic foiling and golden staples or who knows? You know, a typical zine.\nThe zine will only be printed in English, but the things written by Pelle and Johan will be included in Swedish in a digital Appendix.\n\n Introducing: The M\u00d6RK BORG Screen of Doom* \n*not really the name. OR IS IT?\n\u2716 Since the release of M\u00d6RK BORG we have seen quite a few awesome custom-made GM screens made, and now we want to offer you guys our take on it. This will be a beast of a screen; small but versatile. \nA five-paneled A5 portrait wall of death \nPrinted with gold metallic ink on one side and vivid neon yellow on the other. We want the screen to scream in your face when you run the game. \nShould we reach the 325.000 SEK stretch goal, we'll even equip each screen with two pairs of photo corners (for lack of a better name) that can hold A5 sheets with whatever tables or notes you want. So that you don't have to use that sharpie on the screen (I mean you still can, but you don't have to). Think old-school photo album, but for your adventure notes.\n Available in both English and Swedish. You pick the language you want in a post-Kickstarter Pledge Manager.\n\nThe back has a ton of more or less useful tables. If we reach the Stretch goal you can even change two of the panels to have whatever reference tables, adventure notes and/or profane poetry you prefer.\n The front is all art, five scenes of various locales and important characters in the Dying world, from SHE in the mountains of Bergen Chrypt to the endless graveyard Graven-Tosk beneath the Shadowking's palace. \n The GM-facing side sports a wide array of tables and rules summaries that might come in handy during play, such as an NPC generator, equipment and Powers, combat summary (with an optional hit location table), generic enemy stat-blocks and a d100 list of random junk you can find when looting the cultists' coffers (previously printed in MBC: FERETORY and available on morkborg.com). \n\n\nOne more thing\nForged by the left hand of Nechrubel, bound in cured skin and soot-black wood, the ancient god-vessels known as IKHONs are detested by the Two-Headed Basilisks. Wielding their Powers, unfettering the Profane Profound shackled within is a serious heretical crime and whoever may carry these blackened shrines will be forever hunted by the inquisition. But perhaps it is worth it. \nEarly mockup. Might change. You never know with these things.\n\u2716 IKHON is a mysterious box. A gaol keeping four almost-forgotten folk gods at bay; the Bilkherd, the Becklure, the Old Dead and the dreaded Silkfiend.  Those who dare commune with them are promised great rewards. But life and death go hand in hand and too small a sacrifice could be perceived as an insult. This gift could very well be a curse. IKHON is an\n a6 box with rules on how to unfetter the Profane Profound. While you can never choose which one to summon and how they'll react, (willing) human sacrifice will tip the odds slightly in your favor. Within are\n four tracts, one for each god-creature, detailing their gifts and punishments. Each a 24 page A6 booklet. \n Available in both English and Swedish. You pick the language you want in a post-Kickstarter Pledge Manager.\nWritten by Pelle Nilsson but torn apart and rebuilt in a stranger, darker form by Fiona Maeve Geist and Jarrett Crader of the MoonRat Conspiracy.  \n Over 40 full-page illustrations by the masterful Paraguayan artist Samuel Araya, whose oil paintings will bring the Profane Profound to blasphemous life. This is but one of them, giving you an idea of the kind of aesthetic this thing will have:\nOne of these mysterious, bene/malevolent deities.\n\nPledge levels and what they include\nWe got some stretch goals, in case we should get more funds than we need to just make the zine, screen and IKHON happen:\n 100.000 SEK We make this thing, simple as that.\n 175.000 SEK No zine is complete without silver foil details! If we hit this Stretch Goal we'll add a bit of shine to one of the pages.\n 250.000 SEK  We include the official and zine exclusive adventure Nurse the Rot (check the Stuff by Pelle and Johan section above for more details). \n  325.000 SEK We equip the GM screen with two pairs of photo corners allowing you to customize it with your own reference sheets for whatever you're running (just print and cut it to roughly A5 size and you're good!). \n 400.000 SEK We'll make two of these additional GM screen reference sheets and have them printed and included with the screen. Exactly what they'll have on them will be revealed.\n 825.000 SEK We print a minimalistic dungeon crawl in the form of a one-page comic, made by \u0141ukasz Kowalczuk. It will be in A2 format (and also PDF) and comes with the zine. \n 900.000 SEK Pelle will make a generator that will let you generate sects, cults, their leaders and beliefs. This will take up one spread in the zine.\n 1.000.000 SEK, the final stretch goal: We turn the Monster Generator from M\u00d6RK BORG CULT: FERETORY into a digital app, just like we did with scvmbirther and dngngen.  \n\u2716 Of course, if you want to supercharge your pledge with additional things you'll be able to tack on these (more or less) family-friendly products after the Kickstarter campaign ends. These will be shipped together with the MBC: Heretic items. \n\u2716 To buy an addon, click the \"Manage My Pledge\" button and increase your pledge manually with the total cost (in SEK) for all the addons you want. After the Kickstarter ends, there will be a Pledge Manager where you can mark which addons you want for the extra money you put it.\n\u2716 You can also leave your pledge unchanged and add things after the Kickstarter ends.\nNote that addons can incur additional shipping fees as the weight increases, paid for in the pledge manager.\n\nM\u00d6RK BORG CORE BOOK, 250 SEK\n\u2716 The actual game that all this is for. Maybe you want to start your perilous M\u00d6RK BORG journey here and thus need the actual rule book, or something happened to your old copy. Either way, you can get it here! Includes a PDF. \n\n M\u00d6RK BORG CULT: FERETORY, 150 SEK \n\u2716 The previous M\u00d6RK BORG CULT zine, with lots of adventures, monsters, treasures and untimely demise including the mini/solo game Dark Fort which was the original game that later evolved into M\u00d6RK BORG. Includes a PDF. \n\nDEATH TEMPLE SZTUN, 50 SEK\n\u2716 A hyper-linear murder gauntlet of a dungeon crawl. Short (a folded A4 pamphlet, so 6 pages) but sweet (actually not sweet, more bitter and rank). Does not include a PDF.\nCharacter sheet pads, 60 SEK\n\u2716 A pad of character sheets printed on uncoated paper, perfect for writing on or to angrily crumple into a pathetic ball of disappointment. Does not include a PDF but the character sheets are available for free download on morkborg.com so there's no need.\nExtra copy of M\u00d6RK BORG CULT: HERETIC, 150 SEK\n\u2716 Add a second copy of this zine to your pledge. Give it to a friend. Cut it to pieces. Or just keep one close at hand in case something happens. These are weird times. Includes a PDF.\nIKHON, 180 SEK\n\u2716 We don't recommend it, but perhaps you want to obtain this mystical box and have a peek inside. In that case, you can add one to your pledge. Includes a PDF.\nM\u00d6RK BORG GM Screen, 180 SEK\n\u2716 Add a GM screen to your pledge. Includes a PDF. No witty text here, sorry.\n\nShipping\nThese are weird times. Not only because of covid-19 and the uncertainty it brings but also with Brexit screwing international shipping up in unclear ways.

This updated 5E version includes new player options, an updated Worldbook with all-new chapters, and a fantastical city book to launch a memorable campaign\u2014and a caravan's weight in short- and medium-length adventures. The Southlands setting is fully compatible with the 5th Edition of the world\u2019s first RPG.\nWelcome friend! Come and adventure with us here.\nThe project will create more than a dozen main rewards covering 4 major formats with two partner companies:\nA hardcover Southlands Worldbook in both regular and limited editions, described in this Table of Contents preview \nA hand-tooled, rich leather edition of the Worldbook, \nA hardcover City of Cats, a home base containing many adventures,\nA softcover Southlands Player's Guide of heroic options, subclasses, and races, described in this preview and developer's diary \nThe fully-optimized PDFs for all of the above,\n Digital Roll20 editions of the Southlands Worldbook, City of Cats, and Player's Guide for that virtual tabletop (VTT), published by our partners at Roll20, and\nThe Fantasy Grounds editions of the Southlands Worldbook, City of Cats, and the Player's Guide for that VTT platform, published by our partners at Smiteworks.\nKobold Press will also produce the Kickstarter-exclusive hardcover edition of Tales Beneath the Sands, a collection of adventures by Jerry LeNeave (preview).\nSpecial Editions\nThe limited edition will be printed once with a leatherette, foil-stamped cover, ribbon bookmark, special endpapers, and similar touches. The content is identical to the regular edition, but this deluxe, limited edition often becomes extremely sought after.\nThis project does also offer a handbound leather edition for collectors and bibliophiles. This is done entirely in the traditional style of bookbinding, with excellent leather (possibly deep green or sky blue) stamped with gold foil and embellished with corded spine, ribbon bookmarks, and other flourishes. This is limited to roughly a dozen copies and is not available after the Kickstarter. Because of the extra time needed to create it, this reward ships about a month after the other reward packages do.\nBundles\nYou can get the Southlands materials separately or in bundles of 3 items, and the bundles offer a discount. In addition, the limited edition is available only though the Kickstarter, not through later elements such as a survey or pledge manager. (Sometimes we have a few extra limited editions for sale in the Kobold Store\u2014that's never guaranteed!).\n Bonus Goals & Level Up Items \nUp to 10 of the PDF rewards for backing the Southlands come as standalone stretch goal items. These include both new and existing adventures set in the Southlands, for levels 1 to 10, as well as expanded takes on Southlands magic and groups such as the Emerald Order. These PDF rewards are included for everyone who backs at the $25 reward level or higher, and you can see them marked in the Stretch Goal graphics with the \"Bonus Goal!\" icon. Depending on how many are ultimately unlocked, some will be delivered in January and February; others will come later. \nThe various rewards and bundles are described and listed to the right, and shown in the chart below. In addition, this project has been selected for the Kickstarter Add-Ons Beta (see below). After you choose your main pledge, you'll be presented with the option to add additional items in whatever combination works best for you.\nNote that there will be no pledge management step for this project; it is not possible to pledge $1 now and add on rewards later. A print preorder may be made available through the Kobold Press store for late backers. Surveys requesting your address will come from Kickstarter.\nThis project has been selected by the Kickstarter team for Kickstarter's Beta Add-Ons feature. This is a new element for Kickstarter that we used to handle in a separate pledge manager, but for the Southlands, add-ons are now included in the Kickstarter campaign directly.\nAdd-ons make it easy to add items to your pledge during the Kickstarter campaign when you want to mix and match. (For example, if you want the Limited Edition package of all 3 books, but you also want a second copy of the Player's Guide softcover and all the Roll20 licenses, you will have the option to add that second copy and the Roll20 bundle as add-ons to your Limited Edition package after you select your pledge level.)\n\n Kickstarter Exclusive\nIn particular, the Tales Beneath the Sands adventure collection is a Kickstarter print exclusive that is available only as an add-on here (PDF and VTT will be available more generally\u2014the print exclusive version is a collector's item). Tales Beneath the Sands collects three adventures into a hardcover trilogy with new art and maps, for a full tomb-centric adventure series in the Southlands. It covers levels 2 to 5 of play, and makes a perfect complement of tomb-crawling to match the urban, treacherous, and roguish adventures in City of Cats.\nWe'll have more information about Add-Ons in the FAQ and are grateful to be part of Kickstarter's new experiment in Add-Ons.\nThis project continues the Kobold Press goal of reducing shipping costs to international backers and shipping in a sustainable way by using friendly, bulk shipments to three main regions outside the United States: Canada, Australia/NZ, and the UK. From there, physical shipments go to backers via Canada Post, Australia Post, and Royal Mail.\nGLOBAL SHIPMENTS: Because of the difficulties we encountered getting Tome of Beasts 2 to backers in a timely way and the increasing costs of international shipping, we're shrinking our printed reward distribution. The Southlands Worldbook, Player's Guide, and City of Cats PDFs and VTTs are all available worldwide; unfortunately, the printed books are not available as part of the Kickstarter in Europe and countries other than on those on the list above. Printed books will be available via local retailers instead. \nWe hope to remedy this situation in future projects. For now, we simply can't provide effective shipping without a high degree of risk in both schedule and cost.\nAs always with our projects, if the Southlands project exceeds its funding goal we will expand several elements. The more people who support the Southlands, the better the rewards are for everyone!\nIn particular, we will add up to 10 adventure and player option PDFs to the rewards for all backers at the $25 level and up. These goals are marked with the Bonus Goal icon in the stretch goal list, because each adds another standalone title to the reward items.\nThat's the last of our stretch goals, as this project has exceeded expectations in every way. A massive thank you to everyone who has supported the 5th Edition Southlands!\n\nAt Kobold Press, a fantastic team of accomplished tabletop gaming professionals is working hard to pull this project together.\nIn addition to the folks listed below, it is very important to us at Kobold Press to involve voices that represent the real-world cultures from which the Southlands draw influence. To make sure we do this project right, we've involved creators who trace their descent to those regions, and as all of the text and art nears completion and the stretch goals are incorporated, we'll continue to employ these diverse creators as well as cultural consultants every step of the way. Please see our FAQ for more information about this important topic.\nRichard Green, Worldbook Lead Designer: Richard Green has been in love with tabletop roleplaying games since 1980.

However, the place is known among adventurers and lorekeepers, and well-trod stairs lead down into the depths.\nDeep below, dwarven mercenaries once bred their owlbears for war, the sorcerers of the White Forest practiced their forbidden arts, and strange cults from other realms settled into a place where nodes of power draw together. Their treasures and their remains are scattered across the halls and caverns. Those malevolent creatures that remain still spin their shadowy webs, enchant foul magics, and summon forth the dark gods.\nThis all-dungeon adventure for levels 1 to 10 presents adventuring in the most classic style of all, facing the foul monsters below the earth and seizing lost treasure. Sharpen your ax and ready your wand, and step forward for adventure in the Scarlet Citadel!\nThe 5th Edition of the world's first tabletop RPG is all about dungeons (and also dragons, though not in this project!). This is the first dungeon-centric adventure design that Kobold Press has tackled for 5th Edition, and the design effort is led by TSR and Wizards of the Coast veteran Steve Winter, working with notes and characters from Kobold Press publisher Wolfgang Baur's home game.\nThe result is a classic, old-school dungeon crawl that goes from a surface setting to a deep set of caverns far from the light of the sun, where alien things skitter and guttural chants murmur down chill and damp passageways lit only by magical spheres and phosphorescent fungi.\nThe Scarlet Citadel includes at least 6 levels of dungeon exploration with lavish maps, plus a town base, appendixes of additional monsters and characters, and a full suite of PDF and virtual tabletop options from Roll20 and Fantasy Grounds.\nThe project will create 6 main items: \nA hardcover book in both regular and limited editions,\nA hand-tooled, rich leather edition,\nA map folio of poster-sized, table-ready battle maps to play on, \nA fully-optimized PDF,\nA digital edition for the Roll20 virtual tabletop (VTT), and\nA Fantasy Grounds edition for that VTT platform.\nThe limited edition will be printed once with a leatherette, foil-stamped cover, ribbon bookmark, special endpapers, and similar touches. The content is identical to the regular edition, but this deluxe, limited edition often becomes extremely sought after.\nThis project does also offer a handbound leather edition for collectors and bibliophiles. This is done entirely in the traditional style of bookbinding, with excellent leather (likely scarlet-colored) stamped with gold foil and embellished with corded spine, ribbon bookmarks, and other flourishes. This is limited to about a dozen copies and is not available after the Kickstarter. Because of the extra time needed to create it, this reward ships about a month after the other reward packages do.\nYou can get these items separately or in bundles, and the bundles offer a discount. In addition, the limited edition is available though the Kickstarter, not through later elements such as the survey or pledge manager. (Sometimes we have a few extra limited editions for sale in the Kobold Store\u2014that's never guaranteed!).\nThe rewards available during the Kickstarter are shown here. \n\nBecause of postal variations and yearly increases in shipping costs, the shipping for print rewards is calculated and charged in the pledge manager after the Kickstarter closes.\nThis project continues the Kobold Press goal of reducing shipping costs to international backers and shipping in a sustainable way by using friendly, bulk shipments to three main regions: Canada, Australia, and the EU. From there, shipments go out via Canada Post, Australia Post, and either Royal Mail or Deutsche Post. \nAs always with our projects, if we exceed our funding goal we will expand the adventure, the maps, and other elements of the project. The more people who support Scarlet Citadel, the better the rewards for everyone.\nOur first goal and the next few stretch goals are posted here. More goals will be unlocked once we reach these, and quite a few secrets remain in the depths...\nAt Kobold Press, a fantastic team of accomplished tabletop gaming professionals is working hard to pull this project together.\nSteve Winter, Lead Designer: Steve Winter got his start in the RPG industry by answering a help wanted ad in 1981. He\u2019s managed to make a living from RPGs ever since as editor, developer, managing editor, creative director, web producer, designer, and author on countless roleplaying games, adventures, boardgames, wargames, novels, magazines, and web articles. His most recent work includes Tomb of Annihilation, Tome of Beasts, Deep Magic, and Midgard Heroes Handbook.\nMisty Bourne, Lead Editor: Apex editor Misty Bourne is a professional word nerd with a ruthless red pen. An avid 5E player with more than twelve years of publishing experience, some of her more notable projects include: Mythic Odysseys of Theros (Wizards of the Coast), Underworld Lairs and Tome of Beasts 2 (Kobold Press), and the Epic Legacy series, Total Party Kill series, and Tyrants & Hellions (2CGaming). She edits Hit Point Press\u2019s \u201cBig Bads\u201d (2020 silver ENNIE winner) and is currently authoring the guidebook for HPP\u2019s Animated Tarot, slated for release in 2021.\nJon Pintar, Lead Cartographer: Jon Pintar is an illustrator and concept artist working mostly in tabletop games. Designing worlds is his passion, and his maps are published in dozens of products from publishers such as Kobold Press, Worldspinner, and Absolute Tabletop. He lives in Slovenia, on the sunny side of the Alps, and is never far from a medieval castle. You can find him on Twitter at @JonPintar.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nKobold Press has shipped over 37 crowdfunded titles since 2006, both small and large, with 15 of them on Kickstarter (this is #16). The Kobolds have won Gold and Silver ENnie Awards for this work, most recently an ENnie for the Creature Codex for 5th Edition in 2019 as Best Monster/Adversary book. The creative team is experienced, and we keep leveling up!\n\nFor Scarlet Citadel, much of the adventure design and cartography is already done. Likewise, we already have the cover and a portion of the interior art commissioned because of our confidence in this book. \n\nThe main challenges are in editing the material, creating additional maps generated by stretch goals, layout of the books, and managing the uncertain landscape for printing and shipping.\n\nOther risks include entirely new ones: the health of the core team of kobolds (editor, art director, and publisher), as well as business-related risks from COVID-related printer delays plus the recent tampering with the US Post Office. We'll keep you informed on any delays if they arise. \n\nAnd if we spring a trap or two on the way back to the surface?

It heralds an entire monster invasion of Earth, with billion of creatures running rampant. Mona and her newly-acquired motley crew of good-hearted ghouls must stop this invading horde, or this will likely be... the last Halloween.\nSo back us on Kickstarter, and get yourself (and a kid in your life) some great horror comics.\nAbby Howard is a cartoonist whose interests include dinosaurs, horror, and Spoons, her cat. She\u2019s the creator of the self-published humor comic, Junior Scientist Power Hour, the critically-lauded gothic adventure The Last Halloween, and The Earth Before Us series from Amulet, a three-book educational series about ancient beasts.\n Some interior pages from The Crossroads at Midnight. \n We have just one stretch goal for Crossroads, an effect we've never had on any other Iron Circus book.\nIf this project hits $20,000, The Crossroads at Midnight will have a die-cut cover.

Thank you all so much! We've already added a whole bunch of awesome extras through meeting stretch goals!\nEvery physical copy of Cute! will now come with a hard enamel pin, a holographic bookplate, two postcard-sized prints with foil details, a holographic sticker, and a sticker sheet!  \nEvery tier with an Enamel Pin Set will now come with an extra enamel pin! (so TWO extra enamel pins total including the regular bonus enamel pin!)\nEvery digital copy of Cute will now come with two bonus wallpapers! \nHi! I'm Sarah Graley, the creator of Our Super Adventure, a diary webcomic about living with four cats and a cat-like boy! I've been making Our Super Adventure comics since 2012 and Stef also helps out with writing, lettering and colour assisting the comics too!\nI really like making comics about the weird silly moments in my life and relationships, and I often hear so much from readers that they experience those moments too! You can read a whole bunch of Our Super Adventure comics over at my Webtoon page!\nI also write and draw other comics, like Donut The Destroyer (Scholastic Graphix), Glitch (Scholastic Graphix), Kim Reaper (Oni Press) and Rick and Morty: Lil' Poopy Superstar (Oni Press)! I'm also the artist on the official Minecraft graphic novels, Volume 1 and Volume 2 (Dark Horse)!\nI've previously run three super-successful Kickstarter projects for Our Super Adventure Vol. 1, Our Super Adventure Vol. 2 & Our Super Canadian Adventure and now I'm back with a brand new Our Super Adventure book - Our Super Adventure Vol. 3: Cute! \nThe goal of this Kickstarter is to fund a self-published print run of a brand new Our Super Adventure collection, collecting all of the Our Super Adventure comics from 2019 to 2020! The book will have gold foil details on the cover, and will be around 224 pages long!  \n Our Super Adventure is a diary comic all about me, Sarah, and my everyday life with my partner, Stef, and our four cats - Pesto, Toby, Wilson and Pixel! We joke about a whole bunch with one another and we've got a shared love of video games, music and pizza!\nI started making these comics as a way of keeping track of various sweet or funny moments that happened, and since starting to post them online eight(!) years ago, they seem to have found their way to so many other people who have had similar sweet moments in their own lives and relationships!\n We always thought we were kinda silly - we're definitely in the adult phase of our lives but at the same time we don't really feel like adults - but after hundreds of conversations with like-minded people at comic conventions and online, maybe we're all a little bit silly in the same way? \nWe love our cats a whole bunch! We have four of them and they feature in the comics a lot! We've got two girl cats (Pesto and Toby) and two boy cats (Wilson and Pixel). They're all wonderful and we feel lucky that we get to share our lives with them!\nWe've done three of these projects now: Our Super Adventure Vol. 1 back in 2015, Our Super Adventure Vol. 2 in 2018, and Our Super Canadian Adventure last year. \nWe're overjoyed to be back with Our Super Adventure Vol. 3: Cute! - a brand new collection collecting Our Super Adventure comics from 2019 to 2020!\nFor this Kickstarter project, we want to collect all of the Our Super Adventure strips posted online during 2019 and 2020, and combine those with 50 brand new never-been-online comics to make another hardback collection of Our Super Adventure comics! \nWe're also going to include a whole bunch of extra content like my Hourly Comic Day Comics from 2019 and 2020, some redrawn fan-favourite comics from the first Our Super Adventure book, and we're going to include a thumbnail gallery and photo gallery again too! The final hardback book is going to be 224 pages long with gold foiling details on the cover, and we're feeling really excited about it! \nWe love physical comic books - our house is full of comic books that we've bought over the last ten years - and in a time when you can read comics online or digitally super easily, we're strong believers in making really nice looking books! In each Kickstarter so far we've had the opportunity to make some really beautiful books and there's no way that would have happened without the support of our wonderful Kickstarter backers!\nWe're here to ask for your help in making this book happen - we're doing this one totally self-published, and 2020 is a weird year! In return, we're offering rewards like Kickstarter-exclusive enamel pins, a Kickstarter-exclusive t-shirt, and, oh yeah, the book itself! \nOur Super Adventure Vol. 3: Cute! will be a square hardback book measuring around 16cm x 16cm. It's going to have gold foiling on the cover and we're really excited to see this one in print!\nThe book will contain 150 Our Super Adventure comic strips - That's all the comics posted online during 2019 and 2020 so far and 50 of those are book exclusive! The book will be around 224 pages long and full colour!\nWe're going to be including loads of extras too - my Hourly Comic Day comics from 2019 and 2020, a small collection of bonus Twitter comics, a photo diary, a comic thumbnail gallery, and 10 redrawn fan-favourite comics from Our Super Adventure Vol. 1! (Get ready for That's My Idiot, 2020-style!).\nAll books will be signed by me and Stef as standard, and all tiers from \u00a320 and higher will be signed, doodled in and personalised! \nThis enamel pin set is exclusive to this Kickstarter! We love video games and pizza and cats and this set of Wilson and Pesto show that off pretty nicely! Both pins are hard enamel and 3cm tall in size!\nOur incredible backers unlocked our third stretch goal, which mean that every enamel pin set now comes with a third enamel pin!\nThis Kickstarter-exclusive t-shirt is a two colour screen-printed design featuring Pesto the cat on top of a whole mountain of pizza slices! We're using Gildan Softstyle t-shirts - they're lightweight and good quality! (Sizes available - Unisex S - 5XL*)\n*Size 4XL and 5XL might be a different t-shirt brand depending on availability\nThese were unlocked through our first stretch goal! Every copy of Cute! will come with one of these! \nThese postcard sized prints were unlocked through our second stretch goal! Every copy of Cute! will come with this set of two prints! \n This cat-themed sticker sheet was unlocked through our fourth second stretch goal! Every copy of Cute! will come with this sticker sheet!\nThis holographic sticker was an unlocked stretch goal bonus and it will come with every physical copy of Cute!\nWe decided to unlock our final stretch goal early as a thank you to our wonderful backers and supporters! Every physical copy of Cute! will now come with this bonus enamel pin! \nWe've also got copies of the other Our Super Adventure books available!    \n For this Kickstarter campaign we're offering free shipping to UK addresses, and reduced shipping costs for everywhere else!

Knives falling off the tray, lids making butter rings on the counter, bulky lids that slid around while carrying, difficulty scooping up butter.  And we didn't see many stylish designs. So we decided to do something about it. Introducing...\nSMARTER BUTTER DISH DESIGN\n MAGNETIC LID - A magnet on the lid keeps the included butter knife with your dish. It also serves as a place to rest a butter-covered knife during use. No more searching for a knife.\n EXTENDED FEET - With most butter dishes, you remove the lid, put it down, and have a messy ring of butter on the table. We designed extended feet to hold the lid off the table so the table stays clean.\n RAMPS - Ramps on the sides of the dish allow you to scoop up butter easier. They also serve as scraping edges to scrape the knife clean. No more pushing butter onto your knife.\n EVERYTHING SECURE - The lid feet lock the lid into the tray and the knife is magnetically held by the magnet. So everything stays together and can be carried with one hand. No more dishes and knives sliding and falling on the floor.\nMagnetic lid to hold your knife\nA magnet built into the lid provides an easy place to rest your knife during use, even with butter on it. Other dishes leave you wondering where to put your knife so you don't get butter on the counter.\nNo more butter mess on the table\nWe designed extended feet under the lid so that any butter mess on the sides of the lid is kept off the table. Most butter dishes have flat lids that leave a ring of butter on the table or you have to flip the lid over before you put it down.\nEasily scoop up butter\nWe designed ramps at both ends of the butter dish so you can easily scoop up butter. Just slide your knife up the ramp. Use it to scoop up cold butter or a soft mess of butter. Then use the top of the ramp to scrape the knife clean.\nCarry lid and knife with one hand\nButter Hub is your \"hub\" for butter. Everything is together and carried easily with one hand. Other dishes are bulky and require two hands to pickup and then you have to go looking for a knife, usually having to take another trip to the kitchen to get your mug or bread.\nEasily scrape knife clean\nWe designed raised scraping edges to help scrape knife clean or transfer butter from one side of the knife to the other.  Other butter dishes are too low and have no edge, making it hard to scrape off butter.\nA lid and knife that doesn't slide off the tray\nThe lid has feet that lock into the tray so that it doesn't slide when carried. And the knife too is magnetically held in place. No more flying knives and sliding ceramic lids.\nFour colors - Black, Grey, White, Clear\nButter Knife Included\nOur included stainless steel butter knife is shaped with a bend to help scoop up butter at a higher angle of use. It works perfectly with our magnetic lid. But you may use your own steel knife. It's best for magnetic contact if it is more flat and not round.\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarter launches with 1,400+ successful Kickstarter projects and over $500M raised in total.\nLimited Colors\nDue to the unexpected popularity of this project, we are fairly certain that not all colors will be available to all backers as expected.  Some backers will have to wait an extra couple of months if they want to be certain of a color they want.  For example, it seems that white is much more popular than other colors and we would run out. If we run out of one color, we will give backers the choice of choosing another available color or waiting approximately 2 months to get the color they want.  The first backers to answer their surveys after the campaign will be the first to secure the color they want. We have already begun production of a second batch of BUTTER HUB dishes to cover all colors selections, eventually.  Please bear with us as we deal with these logistical issues to treat each backer equally.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have experience with three super successful Kickstarter campaigns for Zubits magnetic lacing solution. With this product we've already gone ahead with design, prototyping, and manufacturing. We're literally just waiting to receive the BUTTERHUB dishes. They should be ready to ship before the campaign ends. We've shipped previous products to more than 30,000 backers and don't expect any problems in fulfilling your orders.

It's made by Pelle Nilsson of Ockult \u00d6rtm\u00e4stare Games and Johan Nohr from Stockholm Kartell, and published by Free League Publishing. Check it out here, you might like it. Some people said this:   \n When we first made M\u00d6RK BORG, we had NO IDEA that 1) a community would form around the game and 2) how crazy creative and imaginative and awesome it would be. But from even before the book was released, people made custom stuff for the game. So we created M\u00d6RK BORG CULT (MBC), a sub-label for selected, approved and curated M\u00d6RK BORG content. Basically, you send us homebrew stuff and if we like it, we make some edits, art and lay it out before publishing it for free download on morkborg.com. We want it dark, cruel, and easy to use but will never accept racist, sexist, homophobic or transphobic content. Digital MBC content will always be free, but now we'd like to (on popular demand) also print it as a neat little zine. Should we manage to fund this, there might be more issues in the future when we get more material. Only Nechrubel knows.\n M\u00d6RK BORG CULT: FERETORY is a collection of tables, monsters, items, classes, rules and ideas that you can use in your M\u00d6RK BORG game, or any other rules light osr-style game about deadly adventures, cursed treasure and terrible odds. All community made content in the zine will eventually be published for free download on morkborg.com, and some already have been. The things done by Pelle and Johan however, will only be available in this zine. The money from this Kickstarter will be spent on printing, editing, proofreading and of course compensating the content creators. \nM\u00d6RK BORG CULT: FERETORY is published by Free League Publishing, same as M\u00d6RK BORG was. They will handle printing, distribution and digital fullfilment. \nTo get you in the right mood for this zine, we put together a Spotify playlist. Find it here. (for some weird reason Kickstarter won't allow us to embed it here).\nThe eyes will be sparkly holographic foil! Don't look directly into them. Or do it, we can't stop you.\n Cursed Skinwalker. A shapeshifting class whose careless drifting in the land of the dead merged its soul with that of another being. By Karl Druid. \n Pale One. This strange character class is utterly alien, fundamentally other, and belongs no where. Watching, judging, waiting. By Tim Rudloff. \n Dead God's Prophet. A heretical character class preaching the gospel of a dead god, slain by The Two-Headed Basilisks. But don't tell the church. By Greg Saunders. \n d100 Items & Trinkets. What can be scored in the darkest of cellars and the rucksacks of the fallen? Use this list of keepsakes and trinkets to find out. By Pelle Svensson. \n Roads to Damnation. Simple rules for overland travel, including distances, road encounters, village types and destinations. By Svante Landgraf. \n Eat Prey Kill. Rules for hunting for food (or sport). Also 54 fully statted monsters, 6 for each major area of the dying world. By Karl Druid. \n The Death Ziggurat. A delve into the ruins of a lost temple city where something is awakening. A descent into undead madness. A Cosmic Necrocrawl at the end of time. The Death Ziggurat is a short adventure about postponing the inevitable. By Carl Niblaeus. \n The Goblin Grinder. The streets of Galgenbeck are overrun with goblins, turning burgher and pauper alike into their own cursed kin. But not to worry! For a low cost, a local chemist can whip up a cure. Until the price rises anyway. Risks? Of course not, it's tested and guaranteed to work! A cursed urban slaughterfest of an adventure about plagues, panic and profit. By Donovan Caldwell. \n The Tenebrous Reliquery. A d66 table of terrible treasures. The Volt Thrower and the Plasmatic Idol. The Cauldron of Lies and the Zodiac Lung. Tyrant's Tongue and the Foehammer. By Anders Arpi, Ben H, Dom Cohen, Donny C, Johan Nohr, Karl Druid, Leander Elwischger, Paul Wilde and Flora v/d B. \nThese things will NOT be made available as free downloads on morkborg.com, this is the only way to get a hold of them:\n Forlorn Philosopher. A despondent, ever brooding character class aiming to control this world's harrowing fate with the power of overthinking everything. \n Obscure Ochre Tablets. Ancient, sought-after clay tablets containing Powers that only the most enlightened mystic (or forlorn philosopher) can hope to wield. \n Stretch Goal: Monster Generator. Create your own terrible foe with this generator. Determine appearance, behavior, abilities, goal and strange habits for your new friend. This will be included if we reach 70 000 SEK.  \n Stretch Goal: Black Sour Salt. This noxious, poisonous and possibly cursed mineral is carried on the winds of the dying world. Spreading disease and demonic disfigurement to any and all who happen to breathe it. This will be included if we reach 90 000 SEK.\n Stretch Goal: The Grey Galth Inn. Welcome to this fine (ish) establishment in the bad part of Galgenbeck where you can eat, drink and hope to multiply your coins with a game of Three Dead Skulls. This will be included if we reach 360 000 SEK.\nPelle's content is of course in English and we will once again be helped by Patrick Stuart, but: Swedish versions of these items will also be included in the M\u00d6RK BORG CULT: FERETORY pdf as an appendix.  \nThe Cursed Skinwalker. And cursing skinwalker, it seems.\nIf we manage to get the funds we need to get the M\u00d6RK BORG CULT: FERETORY printed, we're looking at something quite different from what M\u00d6RK BORG is. This is a rough zine, a haphazardly composited collection of ideas and articles, and we want it to feel like something you'd pick up at a concert, or an underground art fair. It'll be a soft-cover zine, about 60-ish A5 pages thick, printed on heavily textured uncoated paper in 6 colors (CMYK+2), with some extra things like holographic foiling and maybe we'll use golden staples, who knows? The goal is to make it easy to carry, easy to use, and as pretty as we can make it. And easy to burn, you never know.\n Pledge levels and what they include\nWe're not only going to print this fancy zine if we manage to get this Kickstarter funded. If you go for the big ol' limited Cult Leader reward, there are other goodies in store for you. Namely: \nM\u00d6RK BORG FERETORY t-shirt\n\u2716 Printed by Spreadshirt (the same place that makes our Merch Borg tees). This tee will never be printed again after this Kickstarter ends. \nM\u00d6RK BORG stickers\n\u2716 Three of them. They're holographic, mirrored and soft-touch. One you can use to mark character sheets of dead PCs (or anything dead, really). The others can be used to bling-out just about anything. These will be made available for purchase later on. That also goes for:\n Pamphlet dungeon: Death Temple Sztun \n\u2716 This hyper-linear murder gauntlet of a dungeon crawl first saw the light of day/dark of night at our release party. But now you can get your grubby hands on it even if you weren't there. This is not KS exclusive, but you will have it before everyone else gets a chance!\n\u2716 Also, if you choose this pledge level, your copy of the zine will be signed by Johan and Pelle. Unfortunately.\n Sure are. If we get more than we bargained for, we'll add extra content to the zine. Namely:\n70 000 SEK. Monster Generator. Create your own terrible foe with this generator. Determine appearance, behavior, abilities, goal and strange habits for your new friend.\n90 000 SEK. Black Sour Salt. This noxious, poisonous and possibly cursed mineral is carried on the winds of the dying world. Spreading disease and demonic disfigurement to any and all who happen to breathe it.\n110 000 SEK. We add a cool holographic foil to a random page. Or, not really random, it just felt fun to write that.\n225 000 SEK. We add a gold foil to a non-random page. It will be cool as hell.\n275 000 SEK. We include the micro/solo catacomb crawling game DARK FORT with every physical copy of the zine. A 4 page A5 mini-zine where you delve into a randomly generated crypt and hope not to die.\nSuper early mockup of the vibe we're going for with DARK FORT\n360 000 SEK. The Grey Galth Inn. Welcome to this fine (ish) establishment in the bad part of Galgenbeck where you can eat, drink and hope to multiply your coins with a game of Three Dead Skulls. \n420 000 SEK. Digital dungeon generator. If we reach this high we will scvmbirthify (that's a real word) the dungeon generator in the back of the rulebook, i.e. create a digital generator app that let's you randomize dungeon ideas and concepts for your game. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll texts are written and most of the art and layout is done, but we still need to sort out proofreading and editing which could take a while. After that, Free League takes care of printing, shipping and distribution which they have done more than a few times before so the risks are quite low on this one. Our last Kickstarter (For the M\u00d6RK BORG book) went smoothly and the books reached the majority of the backers right on time. \nBut then came corona. Despite us making a game about the end of the world we are not big fans of these latest events. At all. It truly sucks. And to be completely honest, we don't know if and/or how this pandemic will affect us. Printing might be delayed, shipping could be crippled. We'll just have to wait and see how things turn out. But all that can be made digitally will be unaffected.

We did it!\nWe are funded and then some! The first Draculola project is about to enter our world. May it be the first of many!\nPremise\nThe Draculola game is for anyone\u2014kids or adults, or kids and adults together! Two little girls (Rosie, 8, and Meri, 5) and their dad (Chris, 48; see the video and the  Our Gang section) created the Draculola game. Based on one of her favorite costumes and the story of the world's most infamous vampire, Rosie created Draculola and wrote stories about her. We thought it'd be fun to create a game about this character and her world as a family. So, we did. Here's the premise.\nDraculola, a little vampire girl and your friend, wants to make her home, the creepy realm of Zitterstein, a better place. You can help.\nYou're also a child in that craggy, forested land. Naturally, you\u2019re a monster, too (probably!). As part of a gang of little creatures, you get up to mischief and adventure all over Zitterstein, sometimes during the day (naughty!). You scare and thwart mean people and monsters; set up elaborate pranks; solve mysteries; and explore hidden places such as fog-shrouded vales and Castle Zitterstein\u2019s endless dungeons.\nZitterstein is changing. Draculola is tired of the monsters\u2019 traditions of scaring and hurting people. She doesn\u2019t want to spend her unlife being nasty to nonvampires and stocking her castle's catacombs with beasts as her parents do. With your help, she has plans to bring more cheer to gloomy old Zitterstein. Her parents don\u2019t approve.\nDraculola, her bat Kila, and Zort the ghost kitty\nBasics\nIn the Draculola game, two or more players to play kid monsters on adventures. This game is fun for kids and adults, especially families. One player, the Narrator, runs the game, like a referee, and the other players take on the roles of kid monsters. The little ones live in and delve into a spooky and cartoonish realm where magic and meaner monsters are real. They\u2019re not super scary, and they can be silly, but they exist. The game leans toward creative, fun solutions and playfulness. It leans away from violence. Monsters are hard to hurt anyway!\nThe game is a 32-page B&W saddle-stitched book, which includes the following.\n Draculola and her friends. She and other sample characters are included. A player can play as Draculola or any of her premade pals. Draculola (named after her great, great grandfather) can instead be a character the Narrator uses to incite and guide adventures.\n Zitterstein, Draculola's home. This setting is yours to play in and create further. It also works as a microsetting for other games. Visit the centaur- and snake-haunted Schlangenh\u00fcgeln. Swim in vision-inducing waters of the Traumsee with the fishfolk there. Wander the Mondwald, where leaves turn silver in moonlight and visitors should be wary of werewolves and faeries while trying to glimpse a unicorn. Climb the Treppenfels from the village of Arkanor to Castle Zitterstein to visit Draculola. You can use Zitterstein as a whole or in parts you place wherever your imagination takes you.\n Critters of Zitterstein. Spooky, hungry, mean, or just out of sorts, the other creatures of Zitterstain can challenge the kid monsters. Save your friends from the mind-controlling brain bats, emotion-altering whiny bugs, or the fearsome grumpus wumpus. Make friends with a lonely ghost or clumsy giant. Free goblins from the influence of a nasty ogre or help a sick dragon find her fire breath again.\n Rules needed to make up characters and adventures, and play them. Along with these rules, you'll only need pencils, paper, glass beads or similar markers, a few six-sided dice, and your imagination.\nZara, the littlest witch, and her snake, Culu\nGiving credit where it's due, this game is inspired by other games. Examples include minigames such as Lasers & Feelings, by John Harper, and similar one-page games by Grant Howitt. Other guiding lights come from more great games that allow you to depict kid heroes, such as Bubblegumshoe, Do: Fate of the Flying Temple, Kids on Bikes, and No Thank You, Evil! (No endorsement from the creators of these games is intended or implied.)\nThe Game\nIn the Draculola game, most players make and pretend to be kid monster characters. One other player, as the Narrator, does the rest.\nKid Monsters\nSeveral elements define your kid monster character. This character represents you in the game, takes only a few minutes to make, and can be made randomly. Creating characters is easy enough that my 8-year-old daughter made about twenty in a couple hours. The following details show how the character works in the game.\nYour qualities\u2014Origin (monster type), Style (personality), and Skill (biggest talent)\u2014are character elements you can bring to bear in the situations you face.\nYou also use two traits\u2014Kid and Monster\u2014to accomplish tasks when you need to roll dice. Kid is for doing childlike activities, such as climbing trees, sneaking around, escaping scary things, and eavesdropping on adults and monsters (although some adults are both). Monster is for being scary, using your supernatural powers, and accomplishing tasks most kids couldn't.\nWhen you roll, the number of dice you use depends on the qualities you can use and whether you have an advantage or a disadvantage. Any die that shows a result equal to or lower than the trait you're using\u2014Kid or Monster\u2014succeeds. The number of dice that succeed determines your level of success.\nYour Power and Hope help you in the game. You can spend Power to change things in the game and use supernatural abilities more often. Kid monsters are tough, so your Hope determines how long you can keep struggling in a stressful scene. (A scene is one event or encounter in the game, but they're not all stressful.)\nYou have those aforementioned supernatural abilities, a personal difficulty (we all have them), and favorite objects or pets.\nPreview\nSee how to make your character concept here.\nFor dicey situations\nThe Narrator\nThe Narrator referees the game. They create adventures, set the scenes during play, act the parts of nonplayer characters, and decide when players need to roll. \nNarrators have Power, too. They can use it to make a challenge harder, make a character's personal difficulty important to a scene (encouraging friends to help out), or otherwise change the world. Players who agree to the additional challenge are awarded the Power the Narrator wants to spend.\nStretch Goals\nAs the campaign funds and exceeds its funding, we'll add more to the zine. If you like what's here and want more, spread the word!\nAt $4,000 (\u20ac3,650), we\u2019ll add 8 more pages for all backers. These pages expand on Zitterstein and the critters and people, some naughty and some nice, that inhabit the land. We'll expand the adventure generator and sample adventures, too. Having more pages also means more art!\nAt $5,000 (\u20ac4,550), we\u2019ll add 8 more pages for all backers. This expansion holds more material like that of the previous goal. Some of this new stuff focuses on using the Draculola characters and setting in other cool games. We'll also be able to hire more help to make the book even nicer.\nAt $6,000 (\u20ac5,550), we'll add an art book to the project. This short tome collects the art in the zine into a shorter book of similar dimensions. It also includes sketches used for preliminary character design. Some of these images can be used to represent characters while playing the game.\nAt $7,000 (\u20ac6,420), we'll add print-and-play cards to the PDF. These cards aid character creation (draw randomly!) and can function as a three-part character sheet.\nAt $8,000 (\u20ac7,325) or more, who knows what we'll add!? Right now, we're considering adventure-creation cards, play without a Narrator, more character and pet art representations, translation into German, and so on.\nOn\u00e9r, a dullahan, knows about stretching... and fire!\nFulfillment\nThis section presents fulfillment details for the campaign's parts, as well as some transparency on why things cost what they do.\nPublications\nPDFs. For tiers other than Watcher (no zine), PDFs will be fulfilled through DrivethruRPG and itch.io. You can choose one or both. We're delivering through these sites so you have access to the PDF as part of an independent online library. Besides, itch.io is a good platform for providing copies for people who don't have the financial means to access the game. Chris will provide these community copies on itch.io after the campaign and depending on its success.\nPrint-on-Demand Zines. For tiers other than Spirit and Watcher, we\u2019re relying on DrivethruRPG to print the zines on demand. Once the booklet is complete, you'll receive a link to order the physical copy at DrivethruRPG\u2019s cost. That\u2019s between $4 (32 pages) and $5 (48 pages) per saddle-stitched book. (Prices slightly lower in Euros.) Shipping is extra, depending on where you live (see this information). The added pledge price is our profit on the physical book to help this campaign fund.\nWe'll also have a cheaper (about $2.50) perfect-binding option and a more expensive hardcover (about $6.50) option. However, these aren't official Zine Quest 2 bindings. \nSee the Plans, Risks, & Challenges section below if you want to know more about why we chose printing and shipping through DrivethruRPG.\nExtra Copies\nYou can buy extra copies of the PDF or PoD zine during the campaign. Here's how. \nSelect \"Manage your pledge\" on this page.\nUse \"Change your pledge\" on the next page. \nIncrease the amount for extras you want: $8.50 (\u20ac8) per extra PDF, $12 (\u20ac11) for PDF and print book, or $3.50 (\u20ac3) per extra printed book. S\nSend Chris a message through Kickstarter about your increased pledge.\nYou'll be able to purchase these publications after the campaign through DrivethruRPG or itch.io, but they'll be priced higher than on this Kickstarter. We'd rather any extras help fund the campaign first.\nZine mockup (not final art or design)\nPersonalized Stuff\nPersonalized Zines. At the Faeries and Narrator tiers, Rosie, Meri, and Chris will create stuff for you. The family will order a copy of the zine for you, personalize it with autographs dedicated to you, make you four Draculola game characters, and draw those characters. Then, we\u2019ll ship the personalized stuff to you at no extra cost. (You'll still have the option to order a non-personalized zine directly from DrivethruRPG, and if you do, you'll pay shipping on that.) A little of the extra cost for this tier goes to acquiring and shipping the personal stuff to you, but most of it pays for the family's time and creativity. In the end, you\u2019ll have the PDF, one normal zine copy (if you order one), and one personalized copy with your characters and drawings. If you want drawings like those in the book, see Art Add-Ons below.\nBardic Contributions. Added by request on 2/27, the Bard tier provides everything the Faeries tier does. We'll ask you to work with us to create one character, one critter or villain, and one place. (That's three items.) These creations will become part of Zitterstein forever. They'll be in the book. Because of that, we'll want to help mold your ideas to fit the intent and themes in the game. Ultimately, we'll retain the rights to this content, and to change it and use it in future Draculola material. You'll receive credit. of course.\nPersonalized Adventure. At the Narrator tier, Rosie, Meri, and Chris will create a Draculola adventure for you, using locations and creatures in Zitterstein. Chris will run it for you online. (We'll work out the logistics and other details of doing so after the campaign ends.) A copy of the adventure will come along with your personalized zine. The extra cost is partly for materials, but it's mostly for the many hours the family will spend creating for and playing with you.\nArt Add-Ons: After the campaign, Emma (our illustrator) will offer art such as that appearing in the game. You'll be able to get copies of characters from the game or unique illustrations related to the game. A future update will detail how to acquire this art. We're not adding it to the overall campaign so we can meet our basic expenses first.\nOur Gang\nThis section is about the little gang of monsters working on this game.\nChris, Emma, Roselynn, Meridith, and Cal\nChris S. Sims. A veteran game designer and writer, Chris has worked on Dungeons & Dragons, Starfinder, Pathfinder, and other games and films. He's also a graphic artist, so he\u2019ll handle the layout. You can learn more about Chris and his work on his website. You can also follow him on Twitter and get sneak peeks of his work on Patreon.\nRoselynn and Meridith Sims. These two are Chris's daughters. For stories she has written and is writing, Rosie (8) came up with Draculola and her home, Zitterstein. We worked together to make up more about this vampire girl and her world. Meri added a few characters of her own, such as Draculola's little brothers, Max and Angelo. The girls posed as reference for some of the illustrations that appear in this book and on this page. Maybe it could go without saying, but these little girls will receive proper credit and compensation as part of this project.\nEmma Welch. Emma is a great illustrator just a year or so out of the same art school Chris attended decades ago. Full transparency, she\u2019s also Chris's cousin. Her style is perfect for this project, as you can see on this page. You can follow Emma on Twitter.\nCal Moore. Another gaming veteran, Cal is a fantastic editor (and one of Chris's mentors). He has worked on all sorts of projects as a writer or an editor. Cal has a diverse pool of work, from trading-card games and Dungeons & Dragons for Wizards of the Coast to 13th Age and Shadowrun: Crossfire for Fire Opal Media.\nBudget\nChris oversees this project and prefers to pay decent rates, at least for the game industry. For the 32-page game zine, the approximately $3,000 (\u20ac2,750) plan includes the following.\n Writing and Editing. $1,800\u2014that's $0.10 per word for writing (for the Simses), $0.06 per word for editing (for Cal).\n Art. $550\u2014Chris buys limited rights. Emma retains her copyrights.\n Fees. $350\u2014Kickstarter and payment fees for Austria.\n Design and Layout. $300\u2014Chris does the layout.\nThis estimate has a little padding for the unexpected and for fulfilling higher tiers.\nAs we fund and meet stretch goals, our gang will get paid more. Obviously, extra work will need to be done. However, if we fund higher than needed, every collaborator will share the success with a pay increase. We might hire additional team members to make the product even better.\nYe olde drawing board\nPlans, Risks, and Challenges\nLet's go over where this project is, why we can make it, and where we're going. If you have any questions, contact us!\nThe meat of the game is done, as is some of the art.  We\u2019ll keep you posted with previews and updates while the campaign runs and after it funds. (Chris loves sharing sketches and final art.) Once the project is funded, we\u2019ll need time to wrap up with the following.\nWriting to final page count\nEditing and art direction\nSharing text with product-tier backers for feedback \nCompleting art to final page count\nLaying out the final book\nFulfilling the zines for backers\nFinishing and shipping personalized products\nDelivery dates are conservative to make sure you receive the game on time. We'd rather ship early than disappoint.\nChris knows what goes into making a book like this. He's a longtime developer of tabletop roleplaying games and a graphic artist who has been an art director. The team is lined up and ready to go.\nThis Kickstarter is the first Chris has run. Although he has been behind the scenes in a couple other campaigns, Chris has kept this first campaign small and simple to assure the project gets done right. He's using DrivethruRPG for print fulfillment, because he wants anyone anywhere to be able to get a printed zine without hassle.\nChris lives in Austria. That\u2019s another reason he's using DrivethruRPG fulfillment. Shipping from Austria to elsewhere in the world can be very expensive. The costs per backer would break down approximately as follows. \n Printing and Handling. $4.50 (\u20ac4) \n Shipping to the EU. $5.50- $6.50 (\u20ac5-6)\n Shipping Internationally. $10-16.50 (\u20ac9-15)\nThe total ends up being close to the DrivethruRPG price in most cases. Considering possible unexpected fees, such as customs, the region-based printing and shipping Drivethru offers is lower risk. It's likely to be lower in environmental impact, as well.\nZine Quest 2\nThis book is part of Kickstarter's Zine Quest 2 month. This format dictates the physical qualities of the book. It also says we can run for only 2 weeks. If you like this little project, help us fund by telling your friends and followers!\nWe support Kickstarter staff who have successfully formed a union!

You play a Tuzanian, a tribe of jungle-dwelling, vine-swinging, pterodactyl-riding, bone-wielding savages. Radiation leaked from the Invaders' crashed flying saucers spreads on winds of purple, blue, and white, mutating the land and its inhabitants. Meanwhile, a race of turtle-apes and ape-turtles sleeping in stasis beneath the surface awoke...1,000,000 years later than planned. And they were not impressed by the native population \u2013 or the alien Invaders.\n The Bone Age will be a 48+ page saddled stitched book with illustrations by the incomparable Jack Woiak.\nThe Bone Age isn't based on a specific OSR system, but comparisons can be drawn to Swords & Wizardry, Labyrinth Lord, Lamentations of the Flame Princess, and Dungeon Crawl Classics. The base mechanic uses a d20 where higher rolls are better than low rolls, and works in a similar fashion to the way saving throws and attacks work in Labyrinth Lord. Thus, an ability might be expressed as 12+, meaning you want to roll a 12 or higher on a d20. Placing the target number in the hands of the players means they get the thrill of shouting \"My attack hits!\" or the agony of lamenting \"I failed my mutation roll,\" as opposed to the Game Master setting a secret Difficulty Class.\nThe Bone Age uses a class & level system, with levels maxing out at 10. The classes you can play are:\n Beast Stalker: hunters of beasts great and small, and the first to encounter the Invaders.\n Marrow Warrior: sentries placed around the perimeter of the Zangatur Jungle, known for their use of the Cleaver, a weapon of serrated bone.\n Mutant: tribe members who developed bizarre mutations after being caught in the radiation winds.\n Untouchable: men and women who tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to challenge their chieftain for rulership of the tribe. They are outcasts, surviving on their own in the deadly jungles.\n Wing Rider: riders of massive flying beasts, whether reptilian, avian, or insectoid in nature.\nWhile most of game mechanics in The Bone Age will seem familiar, there are some things that stand out in contrast to many other games. The most important is the concept of Attunement. The land of The Bone Age \u2013 called Kalsentia \u2013 is itself a living entity, and the creatures that inhabit it can develop a spiritual connection to various geographic regions. These regions are represented by hexes on a map. If you are attuned to a hex, you function more effectively in it. You can attempt to attune to new regions, but you risk the wrath of the land if you offend it \u2013 rock slides, earthquakes, and floods are just some of the signs that you have angered Kalsentia.\nA map of Kalsentia, the Fevered Continent\n I don't want to give away all its secrets, but here is a taste of some of the things you will discover in The Bone Age:\nThe land is brutally hot. The north is dry, the south is humid. Many regions see rain only once per solar cycle.\nWith the exception of the PCs and NPCs, The Bone Age harbors no terran life forms; no horses, no dogs, no bumblebees, no bats, no platypuses.\n The methods necessary to create metal have not been discovered.\nThe bones of ancient creatures litter the landscape. Bone is thus a resource used for a variety of tools, including weapons.\nThree alien ships crashed on the planet one solar cycle ago. Radiation leaks from those ships continues to be carried by the wind, infecting the land and its inhabitants with horrible mutations. The aliens are collectively called the Invaders. \nAdvanced technology has been pilfered from Invader ships and Invader dead. Wise men and women have attempted to understand the strange items, to varying degrees of success. Player-characters will discover Invader tech in various states of repair. The use of these items can be unpredictable, wondrous, and dangerous.\n But of course! \nYep!\nUNLOCKED! $2000:  I will write a 16-page adventure. Anyone backing the $16 tier or higher will receive it as a PDF with a link for an at-cost POD.\nUNLOCKED! $3000: I will create a 12-16 page GM Toolkit, featuring ideas and tables for enhancing your game and making sure you are able to best portray The Bone Age in all its weirdness. Anyone backing the $16 tier or higher will receive it as a PDF with a link for an at-cost POD.\nUNLOCKED! $4000: I will add a second culture along with new classes!\n$5000: Tarot-sized bestiary cards in pdf and at-cost POD for backers of tiers $16+.\n$6000: A second 16-page adventure in pdf and at-cost POD will be created. The adventure can be used as a sequel to the first adventure or used on its own.\nYou got it! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my third Kickstarter campaign.

Its cramped corridors and dark chambers are populated with androids designed by ASAMM to be so advanced that they are often indistinguishable from humans. Because of this, the factory has been blockaded by a fleet of volunteer corporate vessels who have instructions to kill anything that enters or leaves Cloudbank, otherwise known as: The Deep.\nEvery NPC you encounter is a potential friend or foe and smart players will survive by relying on their wits over their weapons. You can't shoot your way out of The Deep.\nThe Cloudbank was coined The Deep by a community of scavengers who camp on the outskirts of the blockade. They call themselves Divers, and their fascination with the strange androids and creations found inside The Deep keeps them coming back. Sometimes to their own detriment. More than one diver has fallen prey to the Bends, a terrible condition where due to the continuous exposure to The Deep's mysteries the Diver forgets whether they are human or not and abandons their friends and loved ones to live in The Deep for the rest of their lives as the android they truly believe they are. That's why the Divers have a saying, \"No matter what they say, you never leave anyone behind in The Deep.\" \nNo matter what it looks like, everything in The Deep thinks it's human.\nIn a lot of ways, Gradient Descent is a love letter to the classic megadungeon from fantasy rpgs, movies like Blade Runner, and comics like Blame!. We've done everything we can to make this massive, sprawling facility with all its nooks and crannies a fun place to explore for players, and an easy game to run for Wardens.\nGradient Descent packs a ton of content into its humble zine-sized pages, including: \n Hundreds of rooms to explore: Gradient Descent is built from the ground up to be a megadungeon zone that players can return to over many sessions or an entire campaign. They can make quick dives in to scavenge for artifacts, or they can setup camp with the Divers and try and figure out just exactly what's going on down there.\n Hordes of Ghosts: The Deep is ultimately a machine. A very complex, godlike machine, but a machine none the less. And inside this machine are ghosts, echoes and reverberations of brainscans taken by the AI in order to build its sentient androids. Players can't kill them, they'll need to be more thoughtful when they approach these beings.\n Dozens of unique artifacts: You can make it rich in The Deep if you're a little smart, a little crazy, and very lucky. Gradient Descent comes with dozens of unique artifacts to serve as rewards or objectives for Wardens to place all around The Deep.\n A host of factions: The Deep is crammed with different interests. From the Divers, obsessed humans (?) who plumb the depths of The Deep searching for rare android crafted artifacts, to the various communities of androids all living in fear of their AI overlord, or else, the kill teams and Divers who regularly invade their besieged home.\nAnd much, much more!\nWe've spent a ton of time working this module to be the most usable, well written, edited, illustrated, and designed module it possibly can be, and we can't wait to show you the finished product.\nWork in progress. Not final.\nEvery spread is bullet pointed out so that Wardens don't have to read huge blocks of text to know what's in a given area. They can simply read the bullet points and bolded entries, and if players want more information, further details are in nested lists beneath each bullet point. \nWork in progress. The room starts with a quick, one sentence description of what's going on and is then followed by bullet points. Wardens can quickly scan the bullet points to give players the most relevant information, only reading further down when they have to.\nDangers (like traps or enemies) are highlighted in red and with a unique icon (!) so that you're not five minutes into exploring a room before you find out there was a gun-toting maniac in there the whole time. Additionally, the bottom of the page has icons for whether there's artificial gravity on the page, Oxygen, or light -- with icons then used on individual rooms when they differ from the area at large. \nMothership is an ENnie award-winning (Best Game, Gen Con 2019) sci-fi horror roleplaying game that places a huge emphasis on being easy to run but difficult to beat. It uses a simple d100 roll-under system similar to Call of Cthulhu, Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay and the Basic Role Playing system. It's incredibly easy to hack, so you can meet your table's needs (increasing or decreasing the difficulty as necessary to create a fun and challenging time) without a lot of effort.\nYou play as one of four classes: Teamster, Android, Scientist, or Marine, and then customize that class to your liking with a branching skill tree. \nClick the image to download the character sheet!\nWe wanted building characters to be easy so we put all the rules for character creation right there on the character sheet. With a game this deadly it's important that players are able to get right back into the action if their character dies. And why is it so deadly? Well, aside from just taking damage (from, you know, like, a scalpel wielding void raider) your characters also accumulate Stress which builds up until something terrible happens (like oh, you know, seeing your crew mate get ripped in half by the thing that just crawled its way out of the airlock), after which you'll make a Panic Check. If you roll poorly your character could be inflicted with awful conditions ranging from chronic night terrors to permanent phobias to full on psychopathic rampages!\nTrust us, it's fun.\nIf you want to check out the system the PDF of the Player's Survival Guide is Pay What You Want on itch.io or DriveThruRPG. Take a look and let us know what you think. We've also got a great Discord server with an awesome community full of people ready to answer questions and help out with anything you need.\n Gradient Descent is written, edited, and produced by an incredible award winning team:\nWritten by Luke Gearing (Fever Swamp, Broken System)\nArt by Nick Tofani (Instagram, Patreon)\nEdited by Jarrett Crader (Troika!, Mothership, Ultraviolet Grasslands)\nLayout by Sean McCoy (Mothership, Two Rooms and a Boom)\n\n\n\nWork in progress. Not final.\n\n\n\n\n We've got some awesome stretch goals coming up -- so keep an eye out! \n\"...A master class in presenting RPG rules and settings in a very graphical, readable, and gameable way. And it just looks gorgeous.\" -- Gareth Branwyn, Boing Boing\n\"This might be my favorite role playing game other than D&D\u201d -- The Secret Cabal Podcast\n\"This thing walks to the line of usability/performance art, looks down at it, and does a jig on it with its tongue hanging out waggling, while flipping the world off with both hands. It gets about as close as you can to the usability/art line.\" -- Bryce Lynch, Ten Foot Pole \n\"Such a great example of design in RPGs... If I was gonna run a sci-fi horror game this is the only game I'd use... Strongly recommended.\" -- Ben Milton, Questing Beast\n\"It was thematically so tight and so fun. ...Really cool system. ...Definitely worth checking out!\" -- Shut Up & Sit Down\n\"Mothership is a supremely cool sci-fi DIY zine game whose supplements really know how to create a fun module without railroading players. Designers and players alike should check it out!\" -- Adam Koebel, Dungeon World\n\"What a great game. What an impressive achievement... I cannot say enough great things about Mothership. I want you to go buy it right now.\" -- Dungeons & Possums \nThis project is EU, CA, and AU customs friendly shipping.

The good thing is, it is only a glimpse of how much you will have in Corpus Malicious!\nHere is the new demo booklet for Mindabar - The City of Malice!\nYou can download  the demo booklets by clicking this link\nSample page of the demo booklet\nBy backing us now, you will help the development of Corpus Malicious. We will make this possible thanks to you! Additionally, you can take advantage of the generous pricing and additional content we have for our backers specifically. When our Stretch Goal opens, you can also pledge for our special collector\u2019s edition which has its cover made of (synthetic) leather.\nIn Dungeons and Dragons, stories and adventures are often depicted in black and white. Also, evil is often seen as evil, without looking at the reasons behind it. As Dream Realm Storytellers, we believe in the power of lore for much deeper stories and campaigns. So in Corpus Malicious, we will provide a lot of information about nature, reasons, and acts of evil.\nThe rules of degeneration will provide gifts and curses that will add meaning to the corruption of evil.\nRotten essence makes the character more undead-like and unfeeling while providing advantages in necromancy and aspects of death.\nFoul essence makes the character more fiendish while providing favors from devils and demons.\nMaddening essence makes the character lose its mind to the truth of the Far Realm, but also provide the eternal insights of it.\nDesecrating essence is the character\u2019s inner, pure evilness manifested to the outside but increasing the character's means of self-preservation or evil agendas. \nIn addition to the rules of degeneration, you will have rules for vampirism, lycanthropy, making sacrifices and an economy for soul trade.\nYou can create or become a vampire or werewolf, exploring much more depth of being one than what is given in D&D.\nSacrifices are an important aspect of evil. Both players and Dungeon Masters can use the rules for sacrifice to add both mechanics and flavor to their game.\nSoul trade is a common practice of demons and devils but it is left abstract in D&D, the economy of soul trade will add vast detail for this economy.\nCorpus Malicious has pages and pages of archetypes for every class in Dungeons and Dragons. The number of archetypes we have is even larger than that of the core books! Each archetype has the theme and flavors for unique, dark approaches to D&D classes. For example, you can be a dark templar, a paladin that is devoted to a dark god from the beginning. Or you can be a warlock who dominates devils and demons rather than obeying them as patrons.\nFallen Angel - Remnant\nYou will be able to create your character with uncommon and interesting races, which can be plot materials or quest hooks even on their own. For example, with fallen angel race you can experience what it is like to literally fall from grace, and start a new life with your lessened angelic abilities. With remnant, you can experience shades of undeath by being a character who has died at some point in life but somehow refused to pass away.\nCultist\nWe are designing backgrounds that are especially suitable for evil or antihero characters. For example, murderer provides the depths of a past-time, or serial murderer, with different reasons, goals, or flaws. Cultist background provides the depths of how a character joined a cult, what are the thoughts, and what are the flaws regarding the viewpoint of the cult.\nThere are many monsters of demon, devil, undead, abomination origins. There are also monsters of horror from folk myths and legends. Each monster has its own background that can fit multiple settings and a detailed description about its lore.\nBook of Tainted Mind\nMagical items are not just tools for greater success, they have their own character! Magical items in Corpus Malicious comes in various forms. All of them have a flavor and theme suitable for an aspect of evil. They have their own stories as well, which you can use as a hook or lore in your adventures or campaigns.\nSpears of Vengeance - Art by G\u00f6khan Kahraman\nYou will discover mysterious, eccentric, and often wicked and frightening cults with Corpus Malicious. All the cults have their methods of initiation, known agendas, secret agendas, and possible relationships.\nIn your campaigns, you will be able to use many villains that have unique characteristics and themes. You will also realize that even a common villain such as an orc can have much depth in it, as well as much more potential for dread.\nFor adding more occult, flavor, and tactics to your spellcaster characters or villains, WE HAVE 100 NEW SPELLS and RITUALS!\nDelve into spells that are too wicked for respectable guilds of magic to acknowledge. You will also learn forbidden rituals that provide great rewards but take dire sacrifices.\nAlso for more wickedness, we have 15 NEW FEATS in new player options! AND MORE!\nMindabar is an evil setting that provides detailed lore about a cursed, cosmopolitan city. Dungeon masters can find everything they need: buildings, NPCs, inns, special days, traditions, culture, art, and even food. With all the lore, it is possible to design a campaign that takes place only in Mindabar.\nThe first draft of the map\nThe book will be softcover and around 70 pages long.\nWhen our Mountain of Skulls $42,500 Stretch Goal passes, Skull Collector\u2019s Edition will be available among the pledges.\nBy making this pledge, you will get the leather edition of the book, DM Screen, and all 5 encounter map addons. \nHere is our main artists, \u00d6zge G\u00fcng\u00f6r, Muhammet Feyyaz\nWe are working with very talented artists from Turkey and abroad. We can say that half of the 400-page book will have beautiful illustrations. This means around 200\nCorpus Malicious Cover Art by Jon Elliott\nMindabar - The City of Malice Cover Art by \u00d6mer Tun\u00e7\nYou will have quality artwork for every two pages! This is a ratio that is only common for big studios.\nWe want to do much more with Corpus Malicious, adding dozens of new content to the book including new archetypes, monsters, items, spells, villains and more. We are even planning 2 small expansions to the Corpus lore! \nOn top of all this, we have even greater plans for our last stretch goals! They will be chosen by you from a poll of alternatives.\nWe can make this happen with YOU! Here is our list of Stretch Goals, we will be waiting very excitedly to see them unlocked.\nWe will be able to continue working on Corpus Malicious and Mindabar to deliver you this great supplement!\nArtwork in Corpus Malicious will become even better, with more artwork and higher quality of the arts!\nWe will be able to print Corpus Malicious GM Screen and 5 A2 sized Encounter Maps that you can add to your pledge!\nWe will add 10 more FEATS to specialize your character even more. \nWe will add 5 additional BACKGROUNDS to add more variety to your character\u2019s role play.\nWe will add an additional RACE with a unique flavor and suitable traits for a dark game. \nWe will add 5 additional CULTS that you can use against your players or join them as a character.\nYou will have the special, exclusive leather-covered version of Corpus Malicious available, with the GM Screen and Dungeon add-ons in Skull Collector\u2019s Edition pledge!\nWe will add 25 more MAGIC ITEMS to our book. Each item has its own story and unique method for evil. Yet be careful, some of them might have a curse on them!\nWe will add 10 more VILLAINS to Corpus Malicious. As a Dungeon Master, you will have an even larger pool of bosses to challenge your players!\nWe will add 15 additional MONSTERS to our book. These monsters are various types of demons, devils, undead, or aberrations. \nSome of them are horrific legends from real folk myths and tales.\nWe will add 5 more ARCHETYPES to Corpus Malicious. Each of our archetypes has a different focus on D&D classes\u2019 themes that suit evil characters or a dark campaign\nWe will create the first expansion for Corpus Malicious, Tome of Forbidden Magic. The tome will have dozens of new spells and unique rituals. Moreover, we will update our chapter arts to masterpieces with a lot of detail and excellent composition.\nAdd-ons can be added to any reward. You can increase the pledge by the amount of your chosen Add-on when you pledge, or by adjusting the pledge amount through \u201cManage my pledge\u201d. \nAdd-ons can also be managed after the Campaign ends, through BackerKit survey.\nHow Do Kickstarter Add Ons Work?\nWhile we are working for Corpus Malicious, some of the websites released news about the project and demo booklet. Also, we recorded a podcast with Table Top Babble which will release soon!\nHere are the links.\nGeeknative.com\nTabletop Gaming News\nHere is an interview with A Pawn's Perspective\nTabletop Games Uk\n When you unlocked social goals, there will be some surprises for you folks!\n Please find the pinned post (which is at the top) for sharing and retweeting: \nFacebook\nInstagram\nTwitter\nCorpus Malicious and Mindabar will be delivered in a year from the campaign\u2019s end, which is October 2020. We will first deliver the fully laid out PDFs, in which you will have the chance to check out and provide feedback and suggestions before the final version.\nWe will collect the shipping costs of your fulfillment via Backer Kit towards the end of the book\u2019s development. We will provide the PDFs of the books while we begin the printing process at the end of our development time.\nAfter our first campaign, we learned a lot and we believe that it has increased our confidence and capacity in this project.\nThe PDFs of Corpus Malicious and Mindabar - The City of Malice will be fulfilled by DrivethruRPG.\nThis is the average shipping price of Corpus Malicious for Europe and Rest of the World, if your country is usually cheaper or more expensive than your region\u2019s average, you can expect a change in your shipping cost accordingly.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are working with the experience and relationships we gathered from producing Svilland Campaign Setting.

Because of this, our development time can actually be shorter than what we suggest in Our Schedule!\n\nWe have printing and fulfillment companies that we work for some time now as partners. Still, we also have other alternatives if any problems occur in printing or shipping with our other partners.\n\nWe have observed considerable cost increases (when hundreds of backers considered) in shipping throughout the year, so we cannot risk providing you an exact shipping cost in the pledges.

It is a dungeon-crawling, story-forward tabletop RPG from the designers of Spire that focuses on what characters have to lose in pursuit of their dreams in the chaotic darkness beneath the world.\nHeart is a tabletop roleplaying game, and will be released as a 224+ page hardback book and a bookmarked PDF. You won\u2019t need a copy of Spire to play Heart - it\u2019s a standalone game. Within, there are:\nRules for creating characters with curious abilities and frantic obsessions\nFull details of the strange subterranean world of the Heart\nAdversaries both horrific and pitiable to hunt or be hunted by\nMethods for mapping the unmappable, and creating your own personal Heart to explore\nEvocative and fascinating consequences for failure and misfortune that push the story onward\nPages and pages of beautiful, full-colour art from Felix Miall\n  Sharing a setting with Spire, Heart expands the unreal world beneath it. It uses an expanded and updated version of the Resistance system, the mechanics that power Spire, to help you tell stories of desperation, hubris and adventure in the City Beneath.\nIn addition, we are hoping to release a map board and stickers so you can create your own map of the City Beneath across your campaigns, as well as two special editions of the book. You can read more about these below.\n QUICKSTART AND ACTUAL PLAY\nIf you back this project, you\u2019ll immediately get access to download our Quickstart rules via a backer-only update. This is a cut-down, streamlined version of the game that gives you a taste of how the rules function, details of the City Beneath, five pre-generated characters, and Drowned, an adventure created to help both GM and players learn the systems. It\u2019s got everything you need to start playing right away, and it\u2019s been developed to showcase the new rules we\u2019ve put in place after our open playtest.\nIf you'd like to learn more about Heart and listen to how it plays, you can listen to The League Presents: Grant and the other members of the UK Indie RPG League played through it on their podcast. Take a listen here. \nWHAT\u2019S THE GAME ABOUT?\nThe Junk Mage, who is addicted to magic stolen from otherworldly entities\nIn Heart, players make a group of delvers who venture into the bizarre, shifting depths of the City Beneath in search of something. Each character has two parts: a class, which provides their abilities and aptitudes, and a calling which explains the reason that they\u2019ve decided to undertake such a risky endeavour .\nEvery class is baked into the setting, relating to specific factions, locations and mythos of the world whilst re-examining the things we\u2019ve come to expect in dungeon-crawling roleplay. We have the Deadwalker, who steps between worlds to visit the many lands of the dead; the Vermissian Knight, who wears barely-understood technological armour and defends a city-wide haunted transit system; the Junk Mage, who siphons off power from unwilling entities on the edges of reality; and many more besides. You can see images of the classes throughout this project page.\nCallings represent the obsessions that push characters on ever-deeper: a quest for knowledge, an instinctive desire to understand the Heart, a lust for adventure and danger where the walls between worlds are thin. Each calling contains a selection of beats - story events that push your character towards their eventual glory, demise, or glorious demise. Each player picks two beats at the start of each session, and these help the GM create the events that will happen during the game; when a player achieves a beat, they advance and take a new ability from their class.\nThe Heart is divided up into delves and landmarks. In delves, player characters delve through forgotten, changing terrain, forge their own way ahead, or trust to paths built by others. Landmarks are islands of relative stability, used for navigation and sometimes rest, and feature outlawed cathedrals, slaughterhouse mazes infested with pig ghosts, predatory buildings, rooftop communes who worship albino crows, and twisted forests that have never seen the sun.\nThe Deep Apiarist, who houses swarms of mystical bees in their body to access powerful sorceries\nThere\u2019s no canonical map of the Heart; instead, we\u2019ve provided the gamesmaster with a blank grid to fill out with landmarks and delves that will challenge and excite their players. You\u2019re encouraged to create your own places, but the game contains a huge section on locations to draw inspiration from and shuffle together into a pattern that pleases you.\nOf course, no dungeon crawl would be complete without monsters. There are mirror spiders, shards of a fallen god, who form insectile congregations around themselves; sufferers of a memetic virus intended to stage a dance performance over generations; trees infected with a flesh-eating parasite, driven mad with unwanted intellect; a cult of knives that long for blood; demon-summoning birds; carnivorous pubs; flightless owl hives; and Angels, walking dreams of chaos and unmaking, scintillating agents of the Heart Itself.\nIt\u2019s everything we want a dungeon crawl to be: thrilling, harrowing, desperate, and full of wonder.\n WHAT IS THE HEART? \nA red, wet heaven that slumbers beneath the earth. A place of infinite possibilities and an unknowable intelligence. A maze of teeth and sinew, of ancient stone, of long-forgotten machinery that grinds and scrapes. People have made their homes in the caverns underneath Spire for centuries, until the Vermissian Incident in which the architects of the train network that runs through Spire and the undercity attempted to power their engines with raw unreality by piercing the Heart Itself.\nSince then, things have spiralled out of control. Paths shiver and fade, or reconnect themselves to new endings. Walls of flesh pucker and blossom into terrible life. Simulacra of men and drow walk the streets, eyes blank, stuffing their slackened mouths with whatever biomass they can find. Doorways to other worlds, to a dozen heavens and hells, creak open and promise riches from the World Beyond.\nTime and space have come unstuck at the seams, and in their place, the Heart fills the gaps with desire - yours, and its own. It knows what you want. It is a god, more or less, in these lightless caverns beneath the earth, so it can give it to you. The only tools it has are meat, and stone, and time - but it is patient and strange, and it can wait.\n HOW IS IT DIFFERENT FROM SPIRE? \nThe Deadwalker, who steps through otherworlds by tricking guardians with their half-dead soul\nWhile Heart shares DNA with the first title in this series, Spire, it\u2019s a very different experience. Where Spire was a game of social brutality and revolution, Heart is set on the frontier of an unexplored and ever-changing world. Characters are more self-sufficient, less subtle, and rely far more on their equipment than their counterparts in the City Above.\nWe\u2019ve overhauled the Resistance system and tweaked it to represent the environment of the Heart; veterans of Spire will recognise the system present in the Quickstart rules, but note that there are a few key changes too. We\u2019ll outline what\u2019s changed and what stayed the same in an update later on in the campaign.\n ENDORSEMENTS \nThe Witch, who carries an arcane disease that gives them control over blood\n\u201cImagine if China Mieville sat down and figured out a way to transmute the classical dungeon crawl into dank and delirious pop art. I give you Heart.\" Kieron Gillen, The Wicked + The Divine, Phonogram, DIE\n\"Grant and Chris have deftly navigated the challenge of creating an entirely new game in the established world of Spire while still utilizing the brilliantly streamlined mechanics of their Resistance System. Heart offers an evocative, eccentric take on the classic dungeon crawl that serves to highlight the depth and breadth of stories that can be told at a table, even in a well-established genre of games.\" Amelia Antrim, Character Creation Cast, playtester\n\"The thing I like most about Heart is that it's a nicely knowing slant on the Dungeon Crawl genre - the monster you're going to find down there is you, and you're getting more terrible with every step.\" Mink Ette, Oubliette, Good Omens Escape Room, playtester\n\"HEART's Callings and Beats perfectly lampshade the desperate narratives of the game \u2014 the story just pours out like flightless owls from a corpse-strewn crevasse.\" Sean Smith, Exuviae, playtester.\n\"When I read this game my thoughts immediately went to the Borderlands games by way of Junji Ito and Annihilation. I don\u2019t know if that was intentional, but it worked brilliantly. My players were disgusted and intrigued by the world.\" Charlie Etheridge-Nunn, playtester\n\"Heart speaks to the inherent terror of going underground and finding what shouldn't be found, and the game brilliantly invites you to build characters who are crazy enough to try to do it anyway.\" Brendan McLeod, playtester\n\"I really want to praise the story beats as a method of progression\u2026 It made it so easy for me as a GM to set up challenges in the journeys between landmarks and to set up bonds between the characters. It also led my more risk-averse players to make risky choices to fulfil their story beats which made the world and story far more interesting. This is a great system and I can\u2019t wait to play our next session, and the next one after that.\" Matt Tyrer, playtester\n WHAT CAN I GET? \nThe Vermissian Knight, who navigates the unreality of a cursed train network\nPDF - The PDF edition will be fully bookmarked and hyperlinked to make it as easy as possible to run games of Heart. You\u2019ll receive the game as a PDF download through Backerkit, or if you\u2019d prefer, we can add the game to your library on DrivethruRPG or Rowanrookanddecard.com. Every physical version of the game will come with a complimentary PDF edition.\nStandard - Beautifully litho-printed on high-quality paper from sustainable forests (as are all physical editions), this full-colour hardback book is designed for years of use.\nEarly impression of the map board\nMap and landmark set - A cardboard fold-away map designed to make your journey through the undercity as evocative and memorable as possible. Illustrated by Felix Miall, the blank hex-grid map comes packaged with a set of stickers with multiples of (at least) 15 designs to represent the landmarks and delves that your players encounter - including some blanks for you to create your own landmarks. It\u2019s large enough to be used several times, so you can dip back into your own version of the Heart in multiple campaigns. \nSpecial Edition - The special edition comes quarter-bound in red Brillianta with a black faux leather spine and has a lovely wide bookmark ribbon, printed endpapers illustrated by Felix Miall, and a foil-embossed cover design. It\u2019s a beautiful book.\nHeartsblood Edition - Absurdly luxurious; hand-sewn with a wrap-around real leather binding and closure, by Wyvern Bookbinders of Barbican, London - the same company that made prop books for the Harry Potter films. You can choose to keep the book pristine, or have it distressed and messed up (by us, as instructed by the artisans at Wyvern) with the blackest black \u201cheartsblood effect\u201d ink, leaving the bindings intact and undamaged. Only 40 of these books will be made, and three of them are being delivered straight to us because we want one each.\nArt originals - Original pen-and-ink drawings of the character classes, complete with concept sketches, thumb-prints and eraser marks, straight off Felix\u2019s drawing board.\nAdopt an adversary - You\u2019ll be given your pick of the 30+ adversaries in Heart and given the opportunity to adopt one - Felix will create art especially for it to make sure it stands out from the rest. We\u2019ll credit your kind contribution in the book.\nBuild a landmark - Working with Grant and Chris, you\u2019ll sketch out details of a landmark that they\u2019ll turn into a full location in the book complete with non-player characters, haunts where player characters can rest their bones, and details on how it fits into the weird ecology of the Heart.\nUltimate bundle - For the truly devoted, this tier gives you: a Heartsblood edition of the book, a map and sticker bundle, the opportunity to make your own landmark as in the section above, and our eternal gratitude.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nThe Incarnadine, unwilling cleric to the goddess of debt\nAll backers on the \u00a310 and above will have access to all stretch goals.\nFUNDED! \u00a322,000 - SPIRE CONVERSION KIT. We\u2019ll add an appendix that recreates the Spire character classes in Heart - the fast-talking Firebrand, the mysterious Midwife, the graceful Idol, and more - and lets you explore the City Beneath with a cell of desperate revolutionaries.\nFUNDED! \u00a330,000 - MORE ART. We\u2019ll commission Felix Miall to create more grimy, unsettling, beautiful artwork for the book.\nFUNDED! \u00a335,000 - AMBIENT SOUNDTRACK. Working with TabletopAudio.com, we\u2019ll commission a series of 10 loopable backing tracks available for free through their website intended to score your journey through the Heart. Backers will be able to download high-quality versions of the files for ease of use.\nFUNDED! \u00a345,000 - ABSOLUTION. Chris and Grant will write a scenario dealing with the terrible approach of an Angel of the Heart and release it as a PDF to all backers. If possible, we\u2019ll print the scenario in softback and make it available during the pre-order period of the campaign.\nFUNDED! \u00a350,000 - DIRECTORS\u2019 COMMENTARY. As they did with Spire, Chris and Grant will record a multi-episode commentary on the book, focusing on the design decisions behind the scenes. We\u2019ll release the episodes for free online, and backers will be able to download the entire thing in one go to listen to at their leisure.\nFUNDED! \u00a360,000 - LEGENDARY ADVERSARIES. We\u2019ll introduce five legendary adversaries, with accompanying illustrations, into the core book. These are the sort of monsters which campaigns are built around, and they\u2019re all reinterpretations of creatures from classical myth - the pitiable, cursed, toxic Basilisk; a huge and unfathomable Minotaur attempting to escape from a prison dimension; the Gorgon, the Huntress, and more.\nFUNDED! \u00a365,000 - MORE ART. We\u2019ll commission Felix Miall to illustrate bunch more things in the book. Felix is keen to \u201cget really weird with it\u201d after being somewhat restrained for the initial batch of drawings, and we can\u2019t wait to see what he does.\nFUNDED! \u00a370,000 - DOORS TO ELSEWHERE Chris and Grant will write a scenario about exploring the curious otherworld of Elsewhere and release it as a PDF to all backers. If possible, we\u2019ll print the scenario in softback and make it available for purchase during the pre-order period of the campaign.\nFUNDED! \u00a375,000 - THE CLEAVER. An entirely new class, included in the core book - a heartsblood hunter with spiralled horns of glistening bone, jet-black eyes that need no light to see, and the ability to predict the seemingly-random shifts in the Heart\u2019s geography. If gazing into the abyss isn\u2019t enough for you and you want to climb right into the abyss and take a holiday down there, you\u2019ll love the Cleaver.\nFUNDED! \u00a380,000: PHYSICAL COPIES. We'll commit to making the stretch goal PDFs available as softback editions that you can add to your pledge after the campaign is over using the pledge manager.\nFUNDED! \u00a385,000: EVEN MORE ART. More art! Pity Felix's poor drawing hand, but know that we're paying him handsomely for his pain.\nFUNDED! \u00a390,000: INCREASED QUALITY. We\u2019ll work with our printers to boost the quality of the standard and special editions. The exact details will come a little closer to printing, but it most likely means placeholder ribbons in every copy, spot lamination on the standard cover, and three-colour printing for the cover of the special edition. We\u2019ll also boost the quality of the stickers and map board, and we\u2018ll work to offer an upgrade to reusable stickers for folks that want them.\n\u00a395,000: VERMISSIAN BLACK OPS. PDF. Rules and guidance for delving into the Vermissian to undertake dangerous missions on behalf of the Ministry, bringing the worlds of Heart and Spire closer together. In an organisation made up of deniable assets, you're doubly deniable - a cadre of reality-breaching revolutionaries who plunge into Train Hell in search of allies, and enemies, from alternate histories.\nTHE TEAM\nWRITERS: Chris Taylor and Grant Howitt\nChris (@TheMaddigan) and Grant (@gshowitt) have written, together or independently: Spire: The City Must Fall, Unbound, One Last Job, Warrior-Poet, Goblin Quest and a wide variety of one-page games such as Honey Heist, Crash Pandas and Jason Statham\u2019s Big Vacation. Their dream is to keep writing games together and earn enough money to put food on the table, and so far it\u2019s going well.\nPRODUCTION: Mary Hamilton\nMary (@newsmary) has masterminded every Kickstarter that Rowan, Rook & Decard have done, and delivered on all of them. They are the primary spreadsheet jockey, printer wrangler and fulfilment panopticon of the project. \nILLUSTRATION: Felix Miall\nFelix is a London based illustrator and a graduate from Edinburgh College of Art who has a knack for all things gothic and grim. Follow him on Instagram or Twitter, or take a look at his portfolio on his official site.\nLAYOUT: Jay Iles\nJay Iles is putting together the layout for Heart. Her previous layout credits include LANCER, Feathers  the 200 Word RPG 2018 Omnibus Edition  and her own projects as UFO Press \u2013 notably Rhapsody of Blood, Free From the Yoke, Voidheart Symphony and more.\nEDITOR: Helen Gould\nHelen has written for or edited several table-top roleplaying games and books, from companies such as: Stygian Fox Publishing (including Fear's Sharp Little Needles, which recently won a silver ENnie award); Cubicle 7; Pelgrane Press; Black Armada Games; Draco Studios; and Up to Four Players. She also has worked with us on Spire and Strata, and we\u2019re really happy to have her involved in this project.\nFAQ\nMock-up of the final book\n1. Why are you using Kickstarter, given the ongoing accusations of union-busting activities?\nWe're taking our lead from the Kickstarter Union, who are best placed to tell us how to act. At this point they aren't calling for a boycott. Our stance is very similar to the one Lucien Kahn lays out in this open letter: until and unless the union tells us that it's helpful to boycott the site, we aren't likely to help their cause by doing so. That said, we will totally understand if you don't feel comfortable backing us here, and we will do our best to open up Backerkit quickly (assuming we fund) so that you can have access to preorders. If you'd like to stay updated on that without backing us here, you can join us on the Rowan, Rook and Decard Discord or subscribe to our newsletter here.\nEDITED on 29th September: in the light of new information, we have put out a full statement setting our our stance here. It's still substantially the same as above, but with more details.\n2. Will I be able to add on other Rowan, Rook and Decard books to my pledge?\nYes, after the campaign ends we plan to use Backerkit as a campaign manager and will make available the complete Spire line so you can combine shipping.\n3. Will you ship to [my country]?\nWe will offer shipping worldwide. In the US we plan to work with Studio 2 Publishing to get your books to the right places; in the UK we will be working with Parcelhub, our existing distributor who handled worldwide distribution for Spire and Strata.\n4. When can I expect to receive my books?\nWe are planning to go to print in May. UK and EU backers can expect their books to land about 2-3 weeks after we print; for US and global backers it may take an additional 3-4 weeks as we will need to allow time for international freight and a second pick & pack process. We are aiming to have everything distributed and in your hands by the end of July.\n5. What will shipping cost?\nWe are asking for shipping costs as part of the Kickstarter this time around, rather than waiting for Backerkit, as that was confusing for customers during the Strata fulfilment process. Costs are as follows:\nUK: \u00a35 for book only, \u00a37 book + map board\nUS: as UK\nEU: \u00a36 for book only, \u00a38 book + map board\nGlobal: \u00a310 for book only, \u00a312 book + map board\n6. Does the standard edition come with all the stretch goals?\nYes - every level of the PDF and up will give you access to all stretch goals. We missed it out when we wrote the pledge and now we can't change it!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGeneral - This will be the fifth Kickstarter project that Grant and Mary have delivered together, and the third for Rowan, Rook and Decard. After four successfully delivered RPG projects, plus the setup and day-to-day running of our business, we now have a wealth of knowledge of how to make things work well (and of what can go wrong, too). We're working with a team of brilliant, experienced professionals who share Rowan, Rook and Decard's commitment to both creative excellence and keeping our customers happy and informed about the process. You can join us in the Discord where we are always available to answer questions, and you can expect regular updates throughout the campaign, including (especially!) if there are any unexpected issues. \n\nBrexit - Well, we were dealing with Brexit uncertainty throughout the Strata campaign and fulfilment process, and now it continues. We've taken a few steps to mitigate things, including:\n- printing and binding in the UK, to avoid books etc getting trapped in infinite customs loops on the way to distribution;\n- working with distribution partners in the US and the EU to make sure we can send books out in a way that minimises customs duties;\n- extra contingency funds for tackling shipping and distribution in the event of a disorderly Brexit that crashes into our fulfilment dates.\n\nThe Kickstarter Union issue - We're aware that Kickstarter has been accused of (and has denied) firing people for trying to organise a union, and we stand in solidarity with those still working on that goal. As of the time of writing, the union has not called for creators with planned projects to boycott the site, so we're going ahead as planned, but we're monitoring the situation so that we can act if that advice changes.

In PunkApocalyptic: The Roleplaying Game, based on the wild and irreverent miniatures game of the same name by Bad Roll Games, you and your friends assume the roles of mercenaries who roam the Wasteland. In this bleak and radioactive land, you fight to survive, explore the ruins of what came before, and trade blood, sweat, and tears for the precious bullets that have become the land's currency. Explore the radioactive ruins, fight battle-crazed mutants, negotiate with bizarre cultists, bargain with junkers and scavengers, and unearth fantastic relics from the past. Brutal and filthy, PunkApocalyptic: The RPG offers thrilling adventures steeped in the carnage of a bleak and devastated future.    \n\n As a huge thank you to everyone who has supported so far, all backers of Scavenger and higher get FOUR bonus missions!     \nArt by Matteo Spirito\nPunkApocalyptic: The RPG uses a variant of the Demon Lord Engine, introduced first in the horror-fantasy roleplaying game, Shadow of the Demon Lord. Designed for a short-burst campaign of eleven adventures, with flexible character development, and no-nonsense, streamlined rules, you can bang out a character in no time and get down to the business of kicking ass.\nYou start the game as a fragile survivor, choosing from a list of eight backgrounds such as Muscle or Face. Once you complete your first mission, you assemble a team, and choose a novice path to guide your character's development. Novice paths include the mutated freaks, killers, and scum. The more missions you complete, the more choices you make, picking up an expert path and eventually a master path.\nPunkApocalyptic: The RPG includes some variations on the Demon Lord Engine, such as using eight attributes instead of four, with Grit as a healing resource, along with a few other changes. If you know how to play Shadow of the Demon Lord, you'll have no trouble playing this game. And if you don't yet know Shadow of the Demon Lord, well, it's easy, using familiar dice rolling conventions to make it easier for folks familiar with some of the other well-known roleplaying games currently being played today. \nArt by Matteo Spirito; This could be you!\nWant to learn more?

Once the campaign ends and has funded, your card gets charged and I use the money to pay for the remaining assets and production costs. It\u2019s simple. You\u2019ve done this before.

We are sure you will agree, this d20 will reign supreme on your game table. All other dice will quiver in fear before it!\nThe Black Death crushes all other dice!\nStanding at almost an inch tall and featuring a skull on the 20 face, this mighty d20 will allow you to go medieval on all those who oppose you! Reach into your dice bag and draw forth the deadliest d20 available!\nThe Black Death is as fearsome in appearance as it is in name! Many tales of woe will be wrought by its cold, silent faces. Check out some of the deadly features detailed below.\nThis die towers above lesser dice. The size of the Black Death along with its crisply presented numerals means it is easy to read while being frightening to behold!\nWe've worked to offer some unique and exciting exclusives as part of this project. In addition, we've got some GREAT stretch goals. Our backers from previous projects know that we focus on creating value within our projects and we think the stretch goals really show this. Read on!\nEach of these exclusives are part of this project only and will not be available again after the project closes (except the Coin & Blood PDF) so get yours while you can! Each of these items are associated to a specific pledge level and will not be available separately in the pledge manager. For backer levels that include physically shipped exclusives on this project, we are only shipping to the USA.\nNot just any dice box can contain the insidious Black Death. We asked Dog Might Games to design a dice box worthy of the theme and they returned with a killer design! This dice box features a skeletal coffin top and black finish that pairs exceptionally well with this stone cold d20. It can hold a dozen Black Death d20s with ease.\nAs with the exclusive dice boxes from our Dragon d20 project, this dice box is based on Dog Might's Dragon Sheath product line and comes in their Abyssal Black Flame Birch. It matches the theme perfectly!\nDog Might really came through for us on the Dragon d20 project and our backers LOVED the dice boxes. We are excited to have the opportunity to work with them again!\nThis item is available to ship to US backers only.\nLet your Black Death d20s roll in style through the winding stairwells of Skull Keep! This dice tower brings all the theme and then some. At a full 12\" tall, this 3d modeled and printed tower is a sight to behold. These towers come fully assembled and hand painted in the likeness of the photos. You will be ready to roll upon the opening of your rewards shipment! \nThis tower is based on designs licensed from Fat Dragon Games and also modified designs from the Dragonbite Community Creator program. The Skull Keep is a sturdy and well crafted tower. It will last you many years and look incredible on your game shelf!\nPLAY\n\nThere have been questions regarding availability of the STL files for the Skull Keep model, but these will not be available as part of the project as they are not owned by Black Oak Workshop. We do not have an agreement in place that allows for release of the files, so we will not be offering those this go around. Thanks for understanding everyone!\nNOTE: Due to the work required for these beautifully hand painted items, the quantity is limited to 30 (updated from 20). The reward level is limited and if all 30 are taken, there will be no option to purchase this item in the pledge manager. If any do remain, they will be available on a first-come/first-served basis. This item is available to ship to US backers only.\nIf you need to take death to the next level, we have you covered! The Epic Death is an utterly HUGE d20 that stands a full 6.5 inches on your game table! This is a hand painted and assembled item using 3d printed faces and a tough rubber frame - it's light, but rugged. You can roll it with no fear - that's right - this mega d20 can be rolled and used in game!\nThis is an exclusive, custom variation on the Giant D20 by Amber's Secret Cove. You can view the standard product here. These huge dice are awesome fun to toss on the table or put on the shelf for display and are well rated by customers. Check out this monster in action!\nPLAY\n\nNOTE: Due to the work required to assemble these, the quantity is limited to 50 (updated from 25). The reward level is limited and if all 50 are taken, there will be no option to purchase this item in the pledge manager. If any do remain, they will be available on a first-come/first-served basis. This item is available to ship to US backers only.\nWhile not truly an exclusive, we are partnering with the fine folks at Gallant Knight Games to once again offer one of their killer RPGs as a fun addition to the project. For Coin & Blood is another one of many well-received products by the GKG team and we feel it is a great thematic pairing for the Black Death!\nFor Coin & Blood is a classically inspired d20 fantasy roleplaying game with a twist...a twist of the knife!\nThis game has received very positive reviews and is a great read. We're very honored to be able to offer it to you here at as a PDF bundle with our dice or as the PDF with a print on demand code to get a physical copy. Check out the game on DriveThruRPG!\nEmbracing the literary genre known as \"grimdark\", and inspired by stories of mercenaries, sellswords and blackguards, FOR COIN & BLOOD keeps you on your toes, as you tell stories about the terrible things that happen to people, when they head out in search of coin, passion, and revenge...\nClearly, this is a most excellent game in which to sling your Black Death d20s! We're offering two pledge levels for this item. The first includes a PDF download of the game and the other includes the PDF and a code for a free softcover POD copy of the game! These are both excellent values for this product! For backers ordering the POD version, the physical book will ship separate from the other rewards on the project.\nNOTE: The Coin & Blood PDF will be available in the pledge manager post project for $6, so for those backers who would like to receive a copy it will be available there. However, the POD code will not be available in the pledge manager.\nAll shipments will be processed through the United States Postal Service. Domestic (USA) orders will ship utilizing First-Class Service and International orders will ship utilizing First-Class Package International Service. All rewards will be packed securely in an effort to minimize risk of damage during shipping. Tracking numbers are emailed to backers at the email address on file with BackerKit upon printing of the respective shipping label.\nFor our International backers, we are adding a note that the shipping costs are reflective of what the USPS charges us. We do not have overseas distribution and likely will not for some time as we are a small shop. As we grow, we hope to be able to get those costs down for  you as we know they are painful. All tariffs/taxes/fees associated with international shipments are the responsibility of the receiving party.\nNOTE: For backer levels that include exclusives on this project, we are only shipping to the USA. We cannot risk lost international shipments for these items as replacements will not be possible.\nNOTE: We do not ship to the Russian Federation or the DPRK.\nDice Maniacs!\nFor all you dice lovers out there, Black Oak Workshop encourages you to visit and join the Dice Maniacs Club on Facebook.

You mean our thinking of making Poly 7 as we feel that is what customers want when it is the opposite and what we basically want to provide you as a choice. Just like I wanted a few d6 from Chessex and was told 'you can buy a brick'. No dip game store employee. I get that thanks for telling me something I already know and I can also go on Amazon and save money than buy directly from you which is what I will do as I show you my phone completing that sale in front of you, sale lost to you for that attitude you gave me'.

The choice then becomes adding more sets and taking percentile dice we don't need, verses adding dice individually that are twice as much. In the end, offering a set that is 6 dice, saves us the money and I doubt many people are going to run out and buy tons of percentile d10, but some will and for those who want multiples of dice can more easily buy those sets without getting saddled.

Rules light. Art heavy. M\u00d6RK BORG is blackened artpunk/osr about ill-fated bastards seeking redemption, forgiveness or just the last remaining riches of a world that is plunging ever faster to its inevitable ruin. An art book you can play. A spiked flail to the face. \nThis game is made by two nerds: Pelle Nilsson of Ockult \u00d6rtm\u00e4stare games (writing it all), and Johan Nohr of Stockholm Kartell (making it look not bad). \nThe book will be available in both English and Swedish. You choose which language edition you want in a backer survey after the Kickstarter campaign ends.\nWe also want to say a big Thank You to the guys at Domkraft for letting us use their track Octopus from the album Flood. Should you be a fan of organic, electric, hypnotic and loud doom metal (and why shouldn't you?) get their albums here.  \nFollow us on Instagram and Facebook\nOk, let's go:\nWhile M\u00d6RK BORG is certainly a product of the OSR genre and share the same roots and foundations as many of the retro-clones, we try not to care too much about tradition or nostalgia. Emulating gaming in the 70's or being compatible with other OSR modules is not a design choice, but M\u00d6RK BORG can do both regardless. Aesthetics are more important than being truthful to some Gygaxian heritage, this time. As for the blackened part of our hefty epithet, well\u2026 The world of M\u00d6RK BORG has seen its brighter days. And soon, there will be neither day or night ever again. \nM\u00d6RK BORG is a complete game and can be played as-is, or you can pick what you want from it and place into your own game. Or hey, you can skip the text completely and just focus on the images for either inspiration or to cut them out and pin them to your fridge, it\u2019s up to you. But regardless of your approach, we hope that you will find the book inspiring, exciting and terribly depressing.\n\nM\u00d6RK BORG'S RULES are all about minimalistic simplicity. We've designed them so that they will never interfere with your game, and so that you can easily adapt and change them to better suit your needs. In short: whenever you try to accomplish something in the world, be it climbing a ruin or bashing a skeleton's head in, you roll a d20, apply a modifier and try to beat a set number. That's it. And you either let your equipment define your character, or you pick one of the six optional classes that each has their specific quirks and strengths. The system is player-facing, and they will roll most of the dice, to really put the destiny of their characters in their hands. No fudging allowed. The few times the GM will roll the dice are when NPC's morale or reaction is rolled, things like that.\nONE DAY ALL WILL BLACKEN AND BURN. Just as the two-headed basilisks predicted. Lies, Truth, Denial and Envy embodied. Their riddling yet oddly accurate prophecies were put in ink by Anuk Schleger the monk, in the scrolls that now hold many names - The Nameless Scriptures, The Unwritten, The Dirt Pages. And so far, every promise therein has been realized, hence why both kings and beggars now cry and wail. Everything will blacken and burn. The stormy, Endless Sea will boil and flood. The Valley of the Unfortunate Undead crumble and turn to dust. Every city: Galgenbeck and Schleswig, Alli\u00e1ns and Grift will perish in flames. The trees of Sarkash rise as black smoke and the sprawling tunnels beneath the mountains of Bergen Chrypt will collapse in chaos and blood. And still there are those who seek riches. Those who seek redemption, and those who try to stop the apocalypse. They too will die, but they will die tired. \n\u2716 To set the proper tone and get in the right mood, have a look at this Spotify playlist which is currently playing in our speakers when writing and designing this.\n\nShould we receive the funds we\u2019re asking for, we will produce a beast of a book. 88 pages printed with 6 colors (CMYK+2), hardback A5 size with a soft-touch laminated cover with embossed and reliefed details, two different paper stocks, and (if we meet the stretchgoals) glow-in-the-dark ink on the spine. We\u2019re even considering gold foiling some details in the book, but we\u2019ll see where we end up economically. We love print, and would like to show the RPG community what you can do with a couple of dead trees and some ink.\n\u2716 Our goal here is to make every spread visually unique and hopefully interesting and inspiring to browse through. We're breaking a lot of traditional graphic design \"rules\" here. There are no design templates, no grid, we use around 100 typefaces, things are rough, crooked and punk. We use both Papyrus and Comic Sans. Why not?\n Some spreads from the book. Click them to see them in larger size:\nA brief look at this grim world at its final hours. Visit the tomb-mountains of Bergen Chrypt, the Valley of the Unfortunate Undead and the two Two-Headed Basilisks who predicted the end of the world.\n Lightning fast character creation. Let the dice decide just how bad things start out.\n Easy to learn, easy to master rules covering doing stuff, killing stuff, getting better at it with time or simply dying.\n Nechrubel's Calendar, an apocalyptic count-down mechanic that brings chaos to the world and sunders the rules of reality every day, until the final hour comes. \n 20 eldritch spells in the form of sacred and unclean scrolls. As well as a table of 20 arcane catastrophes for when you try to master the powers of magic but fuck it all up.\n Optional rules that adds more depth to your game: Omens that let you alter your fate and perhaps turn your bad luck into a slightly better one. Classes with unique specialities and quirks, such as the Gutterborn Scum, the Fanged Deserter or the Bitter, Forgotten Prince.  Tables to help you bring your character to life, covering personality traits, physical appearance/maladies, bad habits and exactly what went wrong and forced you to become a grave-robbing adventurer.\n12 merciless and menacing monsters and maniacs to meet and murder.\n GM tools including but not limted to name lists, a corpse plundering table, 50 plot hooks, a list of occult treasures, traps and devilry, and the game rules in compact reference format on the final spread for quick and easy use at the table.\nThe introductory dungeon crawl scenario Rotblack Sludge, or The Shadow King\u2019s Lost Heir, where you'll investigate the forgotten parts of the Shadow King's monolithic cathedral-palace. Cannibal-warlocks, poison-peddlers from beyond the void and hungering gutworms await. It is printed on a different paper stock to make it unique, not only visually but also physically. Here, the graphic design is focusing fully on usability and easy reference instead of crazy aesthetics, hence why it will visually differ dramatically from the rest of the book.\nAs both Pelle and Johan are Swedish, the book will be written and designed in Swedish first, and later translated to English (by us). So the first English draft will be OK, but probably with a bunch of small grammatical errors and strange word choices, and that is why we have enlisted Patrick Stuart (Silent Titans, Veins of the Earth, Deep Carbon Observatory) to help us out. He will dig into the text, correct errors and also give creative consultation on how to improve and take it up a notch. Or just rewrite the whole thing in his characteristic style. So we feel confident that the English version will be just as brutal, strange and alive with undeath as the Swedish one. \nBelow is a summary of what is included in the different pledge levels. The printed world map is included if that stretchgoal is unlocked.\nKickstarter exclusive special edition\n\u2716 Backers of this Kickstarter have the unique opportunity to score an exclusive special edition version of the book, bound in black faux leather and printed with holographic cold foil, you know the kind that reflects light in all the colors of the rainbow like crazy. We don't understand the concept of subtlety. This version of the book will never be printed again and won't be available after the Kickstarter campaign ends. \n\n\n\nPDF version of the book\n\u2716 We believe that the printed version of the book really is half the appeal here, but we know some of you are of a more digital kind, maybe you really hate Gutenberg or something. For you, we'll include a hyperlinked and nicely indexed PDF of the book so that you can read or play from your high-tech device. Or actually two hyperlinked and nicely indexed PDF's, since you'll be getting both the Swedish and the English pdf's as part of this Kickstarter.\n\nDungeon synth cassette tape by Heimat Der Katastrophe\n\u2716 If you haven't heard of Heimat Der Katastrophe, stop reading now and head to their Bandcamp. Right now. Seriously, you won't regret it. They are a Milano-based label focusing - in their own words - on ambient punk, minimal-synth, dungeon-drone, wartime music and post-nuclear wave. They will produce a M\u00d6RK BORG themed cassette with the official dungeon synth soundtrack, which will be included in the Two-Headed Basilisk pledge level. A digital download is also included for those of you who do not own a cassette deck anymore.  \n\nOrganic M\u00d6RK BORG T-shirt\n\u2716 Wear the end of the world. This Kickstarter exclusive t-shirt will not be available after the campaign ends, so this is the only chance to get your hands on it! It is produced through Spreadshirt and is made up of 100% organic cotton. Available in sizes S to 5XL.\n\nEmbroidered textile patch\n\u2716 As part of this campaign we will produce embroidered textile patches for you to pimp out your battle jacket with. Be the toughest of nerds! The patch presented here is just a mockup and not the final design. This patch is Kickstarter exclusive and will never be produced again after the campaign ends.\n\nStretchgoal 1: Golden foil details\nWith this stretchgoal, we can beef up the book even further and add a gold metallic foil to a few details within the book.\n\nStretchgoal 2: Fluorescent ink on the book spine\nThis is the funds we need to afford to print the title on the spine in glow-in-the-dark ink. Because everybody needs a light in the dark, and this way, the very book will be your lantern to chase away the worst of ghosts.\n\nStretchgoal 3: Poster-sized map of the dying world\nAnother print product! With this stretchgoal, we'll have a big map of the world printed and include it in every pledge that also includes a physical copy of the book. The exact size isn't decided yet, but we're hoping for bigger than A3. \n\nStretchgoal 4: Bookmark ribbon\nThe graphic design of M\u00d6RK BORG can be a bit chaotic at times, and even though we provide all the rules needed at the game on the last spread, you might want to browse through the book at some point, and then, it\u2019s good to have one of these! We don\u2019t know exactly which kind yet, but we will hear with our printer house what the coolest bookmark ribbon they have is. Maybe you can print your own stuff on it, I don't know.\n\nStretchgoal 5: Silver foil details\nWith this stretchgoal, we match the golden foil details with silver metallic foil to make a few elements in the book really pop out. \n\nStretchgoal 666: Short pamphlet dungeon\nShould we reach this ungodly amount of money we will write and design a short 12 room dungeon in the form of a two-page pamphlet. The dungeon, which does not yet have a name, is riddled with riddles, untimely death and Twin Peaks drapes. We will investigate the possibility of having this printed and folded into the book, but if that's not possible for some reason it will be a pdf that you can print and fold at home, DIY style!\n\nStretchgoal 7: Mini dungeon generator\nShould we reach this goal, we will create a simple but inspiring dungeon generator, to allow the GM to randomize a name, the appearence, contents, inhabitants and the general feel of the dungeon. It will not be room-by-room, but more a spark for your dark imagination. \nCharacter sheet is still work in progress, but it's pretty close.\nStretchgoal 8: Character sheet pad\nOk, so 400 000 SEK is an insane number, but who knows? If we reach it, we will throw in a pad of character sheets into every package that includes a physical book. For free! The pads might be made available later (even if we won't meet this stretchgoal) but not for free.\n\n Printing books is quite expensive, especially the kind of print quality we're aiming for here, and so the majority of funds will go toward financing actually producing the physical book.\nWe're also two Swedish guys writing this game and though we'll do our very best to translate it into English, we no t\u00e5lk as g\u00f6\u00f6d like Swedish. And so will need the assistance of native English speaking editors, proofreaders and translators. Patrick is doing a hell of a job here but we need more people to hunt for errors. And we want to be able to pay the people who help us out!\nWe will need to pay licence money for typefaces that we use in the book. Don't pirate typefaces, folks!\nSame as the printing, anything produced or handled by anyone other than Pelle and Johan will have to be paid for. The work on the music by Heimat der Katastrophe, the embroidered textile patches, the warehouse storing the books etc. \nThe shipping is handled by Free League Publishing through GamesQuest, and the costs are their standard rates for untracked parcels. The shipping to Sweden is done by F\u00f6rlagsystem and uses their standard rates. These are the estimated shipment costs, based on what we believe the book will weigh: \n\nHow the hell do you pronounce it?\nM\u00d6RK BORG is Swedish and translates to something like DARK CASTLE or DARK FORT, and \"M\u00d6R\" is pronounced sort of like MUR in MURDER. And BORG is well, pronounced like those robot guys in Star Wars.\n\u2716 Ockult \u00d6rtm\u00e4stare is Pelle Nilsson, Swedish game designer and author focusing on streamlining the old game systems from the 70s. He has published a couple of rpgs, among them Barkh\u00e4xan and Ut mot sk\u00e4ren. Thus, M\u00d6RK BORG will be more about digging into the right feeling instead of complicated rules. \n\u2716 Stockholm Kartell is a creative coven of writers, designers and idiots (The Unseen Vaults of the Optic Experiment, Through the Gate of Flesh, Into the Jungle) and among them, Johan Nohr is an established, award-winning Art Director/illustrator responsible for the graphic design of Symbaroum, Oktoberlandet and Barkh\u00e4xan. He has been involved in projects such as Mutant: Year Zero, Vampire: The Masquerade and Forbidden Lands. \n\u2716 Free League Publishing is a Swedish publisher dedicated to speculative fiction in various forms. They publish games, art books and novels set in strange and wondrous worlds. Their international releases include Mutant: Year Zero, Tales from the Loop RPG, Symbaroum, Coriolis and Forbidden Lands.\n\u2716 Patrick Stuart, is a critically acclaimed and ENnie-awarded author of Silent Titans, Veins of the Earth, Deep Carbon Observatory and many others. He will help us out with creative editing, brainstorming and making sure the English text is as good as it can be. He would have written this description better. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRight now, when this Kickstarter launches, the Swedish words and layout are about 95% done. That % will be at 100 before the KS ends. At that point we will begin the proofreading of the Swedish edition while the text is translated to English. We will translate it ourselves, and then leave it to Patrick Stuart to sink his teeth into our butchered, weird English, making sure it keeps the same quality as the Swedish original. We estimate this will take about 4 months, including any layout changes that has to be made for the English version. \n\nThe established and skilled publisher Free League Publishing will take care of the printing, stocking and shipping process, so we feel safe you will get the books by November 2019. Of course, things can always happen.

The darker the shadow becomes, the world gets until the Destroyer of all Things finally emerges from the Void to swallow the world and everything in it. Are these the end times as foretold?\nPerhaps. Perhaps not.\nAcross the lands of R\u00fbl, great patrons have come forth to answer the threat posed by the Eternal Shadow by throwing back the darkness and sealing the rifts to the Demon Lord\u2019s realm. The Great Druid rouses the forests fight against demon and cultist alike, while the Queen of Faeries rallies the last of her children to make a final stand loosed by the growing unrest. These and others join forces to find the light they need to safeguard Urth for the rest of time.\nAgainst the Shadow is a cooperative board game designed by Adam Doochin and Dan Heinrich, where the patrons of R\u00fbl must come together to fight against the Demon Lord before this dreadful entity breaks through the cracks in reality and destroys the world. The patrons recruit heroes to undertake quests in the hopes of gaining treasures crucial for driving back the darkness. The Demon Lord, however, has many agents at its beck and call and sends cultists and demons to thwart these heroes\u2019 efforts. It\u2019s a race against time and the patrons must work together if Urth can be saved. Based on the popular horror-fantasy roleplaying game, Shadow of the Demon Lord, the board game gives you an all-new way to fight against the apocalypse. \nAgainst the Shadow is a cooperative race game for two to five players, with optional rules for one player or six. A typical game takes about an hour to play.\nWe need your help to make this game a reality. Even though the game has been designed and thoroughly tested, We still need to edit the rulebook and cards, finalize the layout, acquire a few more art assets, and, of course, pay for the printing and assembly. Given the expenses involved in these steps, We're asking for your help to bring this game to tables all over the world.\nThe best way to help is to choose a pledge level and back the campaign. The level you choose determines the rewards you get in return for your support. Provided the project funds, your dollars go toward covering the expenses incurred as we finishing this game. Now, if the unthinkable happens and the project doesn\u2019t fund, you pay nothing and the project doesn\u2019t happen. I do understand that not everyone can help, but if you believe in this project, I\u2019d appreciate it if you could help spread the word.   \nWant to see how the game works? Sure you do! Grab a prototype rule book here. Note, this is not the final rule book.\n(prototype)\nIn Against the Shadow, you become one of the mighty patrons of R\u00fbl, an individual who ranks among the most powerful in the land. You might become the High Jarl of the Jotun or the Faerie Queen. Each patron has special abilities that give you advantages in play.  \n(prototype)\nTo fight the Demon Lord, you need heroes. You recruit heroes from the land, finding dwarfs and clockworks, humans and goblins, and many other characters drawn from the pages of Shadow of the Demon Lord. Heroes, though, are meant to serve and fighting the Shadow means few will survive!\n(prototype)\nAs a patron, you issue commands that direct your heroes and change the circumstances in your favor, either to give you a much-needed edge against the Demon Lord or to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat! \n(prototype)\nAdventure awaits the heroes under your control. You send them into deadly situations to wrest treasures from terrifying locations and to find the light the world so desperately needs. Beware, though, for the Demon Lord has many tricks to thwart your efforts!\n(prototype)\nWhen your heroes complete quests, slay enemies, and explore the land, they find potent treasures to help you throw back the encroaching darkness.  \n(prototype)\nThe Demon Lord, however, will not give up without a fight. As you play the game, the Dark Lord of the Void places curses on the world, making the game harder to defeat. \n(prototype)\nAgainst the Shadow introduces a number of powerful patrons, each one the great movers and shakers in the lands of R\u00fbl. Patrons of the Demon Lord reveals their stories, histories, motivations, and servants. Packed with new lore, this 32-page PDF supplement is the perfect expansion for creating epic adventure for the Shadow of the Demon Lord roleplaying game.\nStay tuned for details!\nWe will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the table below. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends.

Forge your way through foul woods, cemeteries crowded with crumbling mausoleums and the graves of fallen warriors, and other locations to inspire horror in the most stalwart of hearts.\nAmong other challenges, exhausting battles and devious traps will drain your heroes\u2019 energy. But don\u2019t despair just yet! Your team will be able to replenish their health at the Fountain between battles, and in the Old Church between campaigns.\nExplore the Valley, discover new weapons as loot or for completing quests, collect potion ingredients and elements to craft armor and amulets. If you cannot craft an item yourself, the Blacksmith in the Old Church is always available to assist. Only the best equipment will enable you to defeat your ruthless opponents.\n\u2014 3 game modes: Explore 7 locations full of secrets and artifacts; watch for traps; defeat strong and skillful mobs; and test your might in numerous arena battles.\n\n\u2014 Unique in-game action evaluation system \u2013 'Sinmeter': consider your actions carefully, as the locals will never forgive your mistakes. As your Sinmeter increases, mobs become stronger and your potential to earn additional loot increases.\n\n\u2014 Randomly generated maps with various events and encounters: get ready for surprises, riddles and mysteries on every step of your grim trek through the Valley.\n\n\u2014 Game regions with individual events, game settings and bosses: explore the Valley of Fallen Sinners and learn the unique abilities of both your heroes and enemies. Knowledge of enemies and the game world can raise your chances to prevail.\n\n\u2014 10 heroes to build up your team and individual skillsets: choose your characters and equipment, change up your range of abilities and magic skills. The strategies you choose will determine the outcome of the final battle.\n\n\u2014 Turn-based combat, JRPG style: will test the might of heroes in the battle against hundreds of dreadful fiends.\n\n\u2014 Additional quests: Apart from defeating the relentless mobs, game results will depend on your readiness to aid strange characters asking for your help, and mystical creatures with weird requests along the way.\nUnder an impenetrable veil of fog, deep woods and reeking swamps, it hosts legions of malicious brutes, cursed warriors, the undead, and other monsters who ceaselessly prowl for prey to glut their thirst for new souls.\nThe Valley is home to outright villains who faced death in the wake of their sins, whose souls were utterly absorbed in endless night. Who once lived as glorious heroes, praised in song amongst thousands of worlds, alas, let darkness consume their lives and ultimately devour their souls.\nNo peace awaits these doomed heroes, cursed to wander in torment forever, unless they break the seven seals of the Portal of Worlds and sever the black magic binding them to the Valley.\nNo man has ever succeeded in this quest, nor broken free from the Valley\u2019s bonds.\nEvery seal is guarded by a Sin Lord \u2013 the utmost villainous incarnation of one of the seven deadly sins.\nNothing but complete victory over the seven Sin Lords can free the numberless wayward souls from their dire fate. So the legends say...\nLead a group of heroes, each with their own pros and cons. You cannot take all of them at once, however, as some must remain behind to protect the Church. You must choose only three characters to form your vanguard for each mission.\nWarrior \nThe Warrior is a strong and skillful combatant. In battle, he brags an expertise with swords, as well as the ability to inspire dread in his foes. The Warrior is the most balanced character of the group. He is able to both strike enemies and protect other group members.\nDefender \nThe Defender is so named for a good reason. His gear includes the best armor, the sharpest spear and a broad tower shield. Long years of training in the art of protection can solidly defend any squad, even in the direst circumstances.\nPriest \nThis Sister of the Sainted Cross fears no demon or undead. Her righteous prayers will heal the severest injuries. Her weaknesses include low health and being restricted to light armor, but if well supported she will ensure every squad member survives the battle.\nHuntress \nThe Huntress can skillfully handle both bow and sword. Whether facing a beast or a wayward spirit, her arrows will always hit the target. Her standard leather armor is compensated by perfect combat skills, while her acute eyesight and agility allow the group to avoid unnecessary battles. \nPaladin \nMuch like the Priests of the Sainted Cross, the Paladin cannot live without worship and God. His righteous words and mighty hammer raise the spirits of his allies and crush the spirits of their enemies. The Paladin is also useful for simple healing and advanced blessings to empower allies and protect the group.\nTake note: yet more heroes, to be revealed later, will join your crusade against the Sin Lords. \nRemember, the Sin Lords have their pros and cons as well, thus you must create a unique squad for every battle. You will find every hero has their use in one or another situation.\nEvery hero has his own skills and abilities, although in the beginning they are limited in number and it will take serious effort to achieve some of them.\nEach hero features their own individual Skill Tree. New skills become available at a cost measured in the souls of your defeated foes, rather than hero level. Thus to discover all the skills, you must win many battles.\nOn top of all these abilities, each hero can assist their team outside combat as well. For example, the Warrior can scout nearby to find points of interest, and the Priest can heal allies outside of combat.\nCreate health potions, armor, resurrection tokens, weapons and other artifacts to can help you in your struggle against legions of demons.\nDifferent heroes have access to different armor and weapon types. To equip all your heroes, you may want to craft custom items instead of waiting for a particular random drop from enemies.\nMoreover, since every boss requires its own approach, it\u2019s wise to adapt if you don't like hardcore challenges.\nWelcome to the Valley of Fallen Sinners, where seven incarnations of the deadly sins reign eternal.\nA dense, preternatural fog lays like stinking breath over black woods. Legions of malicious brutes, cursed warriors, the undead, and worse chthonian horrors, all with an unslakable craving for new souls to perpetuate their own unnatural life. \nAt one time, they lived as brave heroes across a thousand worlds, and bards composed ballads to their noble deeds. Until the day darkness flooded their hearts and ripped them apart.\nThough their souls are now heavy with repentance, they will wander without rest unless a courageous adventurer can unite them all and defeat the seven incarnations of the deadly sins. But the truth is that of the multitude who have come before, none has ever accomplished this.\nSin Lord dens are surrounded by crowds of mobs waiting to devour the souls of lost heroes. Let\u2019s get acquainted with some of these horrors.\nPigman \nFilthy and stinking from a long way off, Pigman Warriors pose little threat of a surprise attack. Awful hygiene aside, they are skilled and deadly fighters. Their swift attacks can cripple unprepared wanderers. Shrewd tactics is the only way to defeat them once and forever.\nGhosts \nWayward souls search for a retreat amongst the litter of graves and crypts. Do your best to avoid them, as their attacks can invoke a powerful curse that will be difficult to dispel in the underworld.\nCursed \nWhile the surviving comrades feasted after the battle, their fallen fellows awoke in the world between worlds. Despite their lack of a shield, steel armor protects them from attacks and their spears are sharp enough to slice a wanderer's arm clean off. Our feeling is you will long remember every battle against them.\nSlimes \nSome demons in the Valley of Fallen Sinners are too weak to take a definite shape. Usually these are incarnated as sluglike monstrosities.  But do not dismiss the threat these demons pose. The Slime\u2019s poisonous attacks and resistance to physical damage can prove a severe headache for even the most experienced adventurer.\nThese are only a few residents of the first two locations.\nThe Seven Sin Lords and their acolytes reign over the Valley of Fallen Sinners, which they have divided into seven regions. You must destroy all of them to make your way to the divine light. Every Sin Lord is unique, therefore your tactics must vary if you wish to have any hope of defeating them.\nFor example, let's take a look at Gluttony. \nThis battle will be wear-and-tear, as this Sin Lord is almost invulnerable in his first form. Therefore, it might be a good idea to take characters with high durability, and artifacts granting additional vitality and health regeneration.\nPrior to the battle against Gluttony, you will encounter the Pigman Shaman, who will continuously summon new Pigmen to fight for him. In contrast to Gluttony, in this battle you must field a strong team to kill the Shaman\u2019s backup as soon as possible.\nAs you can see, even this early in the game you must use two very different approaches. There will be much more to learn in the full version of the game.\nSin Slayers employs a classic turn-based combat system in keeping with the best JRPG traditions. Put together your team of three legendary heroes and show off your tactical skills in the clash against demonic atrocities in the Valley of Fallen Sinners.\nCharacters speed decides who takes the first turn. The battle continues until one side is defeated or retreat.\nEnemies await you left and right, ready to attack with all their might, so be ready to make difficult decisions, even to the point of sacrificing your teammates.\nAmong the legions of demons and infested swamps, you will find an island of hope to inspire fear among even the strongest of your opponents \u2013 the Old Church. While roaming the Valley of Fallen Sinners, the Church will be your haven and stronghold, granting you a safe place to rest and replenish your supplies. You can also invite other characters encountered on the way to join you here. Many of them will set up their stalls in the Church and help you with not only a good word, but a good deed as well.\nBe careful during your journey to pay close attention to such opportunities.\nHow do we make every playthru both unique and as challenging as the previous one?

This means players discover something new every time they play the game. Do you think you know every bit of rubble and bone in the cemetery?

So far, we have published Alteric for \u0420\u0421/Mac and PS4/XBox/Nintendo Switch/PSP, as well as Pandarama: The Lost Toys for Android/iOS.\nSin Slayers is a passion project for us. The game has already received positive feedback from our fans, and furthermore won the Indie Prize Finalist title at Casual Connect Serbia, 2018.\nWhy Kickstarter ?\nWe develop our game for over a year and already have a working Alpha version of the game. Publisher can finance the game, but budget is limited and we can't make our game as good as we initially intended.\n  Because of that we want to ask you, roguelike and RPG fans for help. Help us make another great addition to the roguelike family. Let's tell the world once again that indie games are the future of the gaming industry.

However, there is always a chance that we'll need to postpone Sin Slayers release date. At least for an extra polish.\n \n2. There's always a possibility that we won't be able to deliver some rewards or contact backers who pledged their designs on time.\n \n3.

November 8th - 10th, 2019.  \nAcadeCon would not exist if not for The RPG Academy podcast and they are forever intertwined.  The motto of the Podcast is \"if you're having fun, you're doing it right!' and our goal has always been to help more people play games and have more fun while doing it.\nWe're not into telling our listeners they should play the way we play, but instead - play the way that's the most fun for them at their table and with their group.  And that's the same attitude we bring to AcadeCon.  We don't go in for edition waring or gatekeeping. AcadeCon is open to gamers of all types and experiences levels. No matter which games you love, you're likely to find people at AcadeCon who also love that game and if not you'll probably find people open to learning it from you or happy to teach you the game(s) they love. We want to provide a place for people to play these games and have fun. \nAcadeCon started in Michael's basement and no matter how large it grows, the idea of playing games with your friends will always be at the heart of what we're trying to do and that's where the AcadeCon motto comes from:  Gaming with friends, old and new!\nIn addition to playing games with friends (old and new), AcadeCon offers almost unprecedented access to some amazing RPG designers, authors, and fan favorite podcasting personalities. At AcadeCon, these people are there to have fun and play games, just like you. Join into one of their events and don't be surprised if they join into one of yours!\nIf that sounds like something you\u2019d like to support then this is the place for you. If you can, support our Kickstarter by going ahead and buying your badge now. We know it's early and life can change so we do offer the option of getting a refund (minus the 10% we lose to Kickstarter fees) up until November 1st.  \nThank you for checking out our Kickstarter and we hope to see you in November!\n                                 What's AcadeCon all about?\nAcadeCon is specifically designed to be a smaller, non-traditional convention. We are not trying to (nor do we want to) compete with or replace the huge conventions that attract a national audience. At our convention, you're going to get access to some of the most amazing GMs and players, a better chance to play in the games you want, the opportunity to spend time and game with special guests, and time to hang out with some of the best gamers in the world\u2014the fans of our show and returning AcadeCon alumni.\nJoe Meade is taking some play testers through a session of Omens of Destiny. Look for it soon from NobleQuest.\nWhether you are one of our listeners, are interested in meeting and playing with some of our special guests, or just found us by accident, we hope you'll consider grabbing a badge or maybe just a donation to help keep AcadeCon around in Dayton for years to come.\nMike from Flatworks Gaming grabbed one of our vendor tables and ran demos and sold copies of Dwarven Smithy all weekend long.\nAcadeCon 2019 is our 7th annual gaming convention. From that first year of 15 people to last year with over 500, AcadeCon continues to grow. Help us grow by coming to play games with us and telling all your friends about us as well.\nWant to see more pictures from previous AcadeCons?\nPhoto Gallery from AcadeCon 2016\nPhoto Gallery from AcadeCon 2017\nPhoto Gallery from AcadeCon 2018\nHere are some podcast recaps where folks have talked about their experiences at AcadeCons past.

Some do panels, some hold live events, some run games and some may join into your game.\n  In addition to covering our deposits, this KS will help us set our budget for bringing in guests for this year and scheduling them early helps ensure they are able to join us.\nConfirmed guests for this year:\nRob Schwalb  - Schwalb Entertainment\nVictoria Rogers - The Broadswords\nTracy Gibbons - The Broadswords\nBianca Zelda - The Broadswords\nRich Baker - Sasquatch Game Studio\nJohn Arcadian - Gnome Stew\nKatrina Ostrander - Freelancer\nDM Mitch - Dungeon Master's Block Podcast\nCraig Campbell - Nerdburger Games\nA.P.

Our primary goal is to increase the number of marginalized people in all aspects of tabletop gaming through the power of positive representation. Our volunteers run and teach roleplaying games, miniature war games, board games, LARPs, and card games. In addition, we run board game socials using our own board game library, panels on topics that span the whole range of gaming experiences, and provide our volunteers with everything they need to succeed from snacks to dry-erase game mats. Together, we move the needle on making conventions more diverse. \n\nGames on Demand is an open-gaming event put on at various conventions, sometimes under the \u201cIndie Games Exposion\u201d organizational label. It typically consists of designated area with tables, materials, and a constant supply of enthusiastic volunteers prepared to run a variety of independent and cutting edge games. \n\n                            Space Bridge Simulator \nARTEMIS Space Bridge Simulator\nOur inner sci-fi nerds are insanely happy to have this chance to pull on those costumes that we don't tell anyone about and log some time on the Artemis Space Bridge Simulator. Sponsored by Dwarven Woodworking this is going to one of the highlights of the convention. Registration information for these games will be included in the gaming schedule when it is released after the campaign ends. Unlike many conventions that host a simulator, ours does not cost extra. It's all included in your badge\u2014though we won't be upset if you give them a donation or purchase some of their wares in exchange for their presence at AcadeCon. \nSponsored by  Double Exposure, the Envoy program is unique and awesome! The Double Exposure team will provide us with about 25 brand-new games that you can try out during AcadeCon. Every time you play a demo, you are entered into a drawing to win that game! You can play the same game multiple times to get a better chance at winning something you really enjoy or play them all and see if Lady Luck is smiling on you.\nOpen Game Library:\nAll badge holders are able to check out any of our game library games free of charge (with ID) during our regular event hours. To see a current list of all the games we have CLICK HERE. Don't see your favorite?  donate a copy to us or increase your pledge level by enough to cover the price and and we'll buy a copy to add in.  At worst, shoot us a msg that you'd like to see that game added and we'll see if we can get a copy before this year's event.\nCode of Conduct & Terms of Service.\nAcadeCon is an inclusive gaming event open to gamers of all types. Every attendee will be subject to our Code of Conduct and Terms of Service.\nFurther - all attendees agree to abide by our terms of service. This is to ensure every attendee feels welcome. Failure to comply with our ToS can result in expulsion from AcadeCon without a refund.  At it's heart we ask that you don't be a jerk, but for all the details follow the link - Click here to read our terms of service:\nThank you for taking a look at our campaign. We truly hope you'll consider supporting us now and grabbing a badge later to come out to play games with us in November.\nStretch goals:\nBased on last year, we may have rented out more space in the DCC than we needed and wasted space made us less profitable.  For this year we're going to step back and bit and our initial goal is to raise enough money for room 101, the larger main gaming room.  At $13,700.00 we can rent that space and pay for all the miscellaneous things that go along with it.\nAfter the initial goal we'll be using additional funds to rent out the side rooms which we used for Panels, Seminars, and Entertainment events.  Each increment of $300 will allow us to rent one of these rooms for one day.\nMore stretch goals . . .  if we manage to get enough funds to rent all the space we would want or need  we will find a way to use those funds to improve the overall experience.  \nADD ONs\nKickstarter exclusive T-shirts.  While we will have a few T-shirts for sale during the event it helps us to know what people want and what sizes they need. If you'd like to pre-order a T-shirt that is only available through the Kickstarter you can add either $18 or $20 (for sizes XXL and XXXL). We'll reach out before the order to ask your size and preferred cut.\nAcadeCon 2019 D6+1's.  Each of our guests received one of our commemorative D6's each year. If you'd like to add on 3 more to get a full set of 4 please add $2.00 to your pledge. If you'd like even more, add $1.00 per die you'd like added. Please contact us via the KS messaging system to let us know what your over pledge is for.\nAcadeCon 2019 Token chip. Currently our VIP guests get 5 of our yearly poker chip tokens and we sell them during the event. If you'd like to pre-order them we can provide them at a discount vs the for-sale price.  For each chip you'd like, please add $1.00 to your pledge. Please contact us via the KS messaging system to let us know what your over pledge is for.\nRisks and challenges\nAt this point, the biggest risk is that we don't fund, in which case the event does not happen. If we can't make it to our minimal funding we can't afford to put on the show. As long as we fund, only a catastrophe would stop the event from happening.\nBeyond that, we are having the event in southern Ohio in November. We can't control the weather so there may be a chance that people coming from out of town may have difficulty getting there or back. We are not responsible for any travel arrangements, costs, or difficulties.\nThis is our 7th year running AcadeCon and 5th as a public event.

No need for expensive new hardware and software. Just four restickable \"beacons\" for any sized surface and one futuristic smartphone app that connects with many of the popular cloud services you already use!\nPlace the four restickable beacon quadra-triangles in each corner of any size whiteboard, and start writing the way you normally would. Then download the free Rocketbook app. When you scan your whiteboard with the app, the space aged machine vision will \u201csee\u201d the Beacons and quickly capture your whiteboard from any angle. \nRocketbook Beacons can modernize any size whiteboard you have hanging around. If your surface area is small, and every inch of writing space counts, simply cut the beacons to size and the app will still capture your work! The majority of whiteboards (over 3 feet wide or high) will work great without trimming!\nThe Rocketbook app will instantly adjust and visually enhance your scans so the digital version is light years ahead of the real thing.\nThe Rocketbook app allows you to assign 7 shortcut symbols to \"destinations\" in the cloud which could be any folder inside Dropbox, Evernote, Google Docs, your email address, and many other popular services.\nSet up the app to instantly beam your notes, diagrams, and big ideas. And save precious time by transcribing your handwriting with powerful optical character recognition (OCR) technology.\nFor crucial missions with a scattered crew, the app allows you to stream your whiteboard in real-time. Switch to \u201cBroadcast\u201d mode, share the unique URL and get ready to collaborate with your team anywhere in the world. Your private, real-time page is updated every time you scan your whiteboard. Or simply prop your phone facing your whiteboard and set the app to auto-scan every 5 seconds. \nRocketbook Beacons are made with space aged micro-suction technology that is specially designed to stick to whiteboard surfaces. This synthetic and durable material acts like millions of microscopic suction cups that cling to your whiteboard and won't deteriorate over time like other sticky adhesives.  The beacons can even be cleaned to ensure a quality bond with each use! \nThe Rocketbook app can transcribe your handwriting with OCR or \u201cOptical Character Recognition\u201d technology. Transcription allows you to send a digital text version of your whiteboard, or even search through all of your scans with keywords and phrases. You can even auto-name your files by placing two hashtags \u2018#\u2019 on either side of a title like ##THIS TITLE##. Traditional surfaces will never be the same! \nFor more information on our OCR features, fly over to the Rocketbook Launch page\nCustomers & Duties Information For International Orders\nWe cannot mark as gift, this is illegal so we will not be able to do this.\nOur prices do not include VAT, GST or other country taxes.\nAs many of you know, our terms of sale are CIF destination.

Nothing beats the thrill of coming together to defeat a seemingly insurmountable foe. 5TDM doesn't pull any punches. It puts you through the wringer and lets your group emerge closer to each other than ever. It is competitive, but not toxic.\nSmall groups of player characters are pitted against each other in a no-holds-barred frenzy of carnage in a team-based, player-vs-player competition. 5th Edition Team Deathmatch is a contest of skill, wits, and luck. 5TDM is about winning the world's most popular roleplaying game.\nTeam Fortress\nTHIS GAME IS FINISHED! We are running this Kickstarter campaign in order to raise funds for editing, layout, final art, and printing. Backers will receive the fully playable rough draft documents at the very start of the campiagn.\nTHE GAME IS AMAZING! We've been doing this kind of team deathmatch since 2011, hosting many live tournaments from small shops to the grandeur of GenCon. We are the original auteurs - this Kickstarter will help give us a spotlight on a more grand stage to show you what wonders we've accomplished.\nSTRETCH GOAL #1 - NEW ARENA BY SERSA VICTORY\nAt a funding level of $5,000 a secret arena shall be unlocked!

DiceMonkey & Gnome Stew \nPlaying on Arena: Slaughterhouse \nOUR MISSION\nThe mission of Defy Danger is to intensify your gaming experience at the table by pushing the boundaries of what is possible in a tabletop roleplaying game. This project takes the feel of platform fighting games, online games, tactical war games, and competitive team vs. team exercises and brings it to the worlds most popular roleplaying game. We have developed a core ruleset with twenty deadly arenas that challenge player and team alike. This product also includes a series of hard-earned tips on character creation, tactics, running tournament, and how to design your own deadly arena.\nWith your backing, we will deliver a product that will make you rethink what is possible at the table, and fuel the competitive juices within. The design of 5TDM has been put through the fires and is now ready for prime time. You can help us make our dream of this multiplayer RPG game a reality by backing this Kickstarter, allowing us the funds to produce this in a professional way.\nStrike The Earth\nWHAT YOU GET\nThis is a 100+ page book with twenty original maps, custom rules for competitive team vs. team play, a strategy guide, a guide to running your own matches, and a guide to running tournaments.\nBackers at the Hey Not Too Rough level and above will be contacted individually and given the option of joining an online exhibition match. These singular matches will be friendlies with no trophies or reward at stake besides the sweet taste of glory.\nFEATURES\n5TDM is inspired by the heart-pounding action of many popular video games and other media franchises put into the form of a new RPG game. Where it elevates beyond the confinements of a video game or board game is the room for creativity and design provided by tabletop roleplaying games. 5TDM also serves as a crucible where you and your closest friends face the utmost trial - a rival adventuring team. This project allows excited referees the tools needed to run their own 5TDM matches, tournaments, and advise on how to start creating new arenas of their own.\nThe project will deliver:\nIntroduction to the style of gaming 5TDM heralds\nCharacter creation rules designed to maximize both fun and carnage\nDouble-page full-color cartography of twenty (20) hellscape arenas of death, along with full page rules. Total. Brutal.\nSpeaking of arenas, totally gonzo over-the-top locations that bend the existing rules in new and creative ways; for example, an arena of ricochet pinball pseudo-physics\nStrategy guidance on each arena\nGuidance on running individual matches as well as full-scale tournaments\nInstructions on how best to design your own fighting arena\nPre-Generated characters as guidelines for solid deathmatch strategy\nAstral Ambush\nGAME MECHANICS\n5TDM is much more nuanced and challenging than simple one-on-one duels. It requires a deep understanding of the core ruleset, strong teamwork and communication skills, and an unending thirst for blood.\nFast, frantic play is encouraged. Dungeoneers deemed to be stalling, delaying, or in any way slowing the game will be killed at the referee's decree.\nTournaments consist of individual encounters called matches. Each match lasts between 45 to 60 minutes. At the end of every match, the number of dungeoneer deaths will be tallied, and the team with the least number of deaths will be declared the winner. Tournaments typically are ladder bracket style and consist of three different maps that highlight different character features or builds.\nDeath is not the end in 5TDM. Dead (aka \u201cGibbed\u201d) player characters respawn to come back in on their next turn to take revenge on their enemies and even the score. It is an unending struggle of violence and pain.\nEach player\u2019s turn lasts only a minute or so in real-time. Focus is needed on everyone else\u2019s turn to plan ahead in a constantly shifting tactical environment. Players who dilly-dally and waste time are punished for delaying the game.\nPre-made arenas provide unique situations to afford players tactical opportunities to wreak havoc on other players, or gain boons for themselves and/or their allies. Arenas will each have their own special rules, forcing players to develop a deeper level of strategy in order to take advantage of each map they expect to compete on. \nPinball Wizard\nARENAS\nThe heart of 5TDM is the innovative ways it puts forth for teams to do battle.\nSlaughterhouse.A two-level meatgrinder full of nailgun turrets and unstoppable conveyors feeding a central pit of serrated blades.\nDead Simple. The no-frills arena, an opportunity to show off true tactical skill in a minimalist setting.\nThe Citadel. A dread fortress, home to the armory holding the fabled intelligent sword Blackrazor, and an array of powerful siege weaponry.\nRun! A never-ending race through trap gauntlets with bizarre doors and portals.\nCollapse. Floating above the Elemental Chaos, this icy arena falls apart in the heart of battle, plunging the combatants into the bottomless abyss below.\nRetroverse Arcade. Dungeoneers dial it back to the 80's and plunk a few more quarters into the machine. Wakka-wakka-wakka-wakka!\nPinball Wizard. You\u2019re a wizard. A pinball wizard. Grab an extra ball to keep your allies up as you slam tilt your enemies into the great unknown below the flippers.\nDhakaan Hegemony. The battle over the Lost Crown of Tesh-Naga rages eternally over the treasure hoard of Tiamat, the Dragon Goddess of Greed.\nCourt of the Storm Lord. The stormlord Xann, god of the skies, rules over this windswept temple. Are you strong enough to control the storms and strike down thy foes?\nTeam Fortress. In a realm of disorder and horror, we find teams of gladiators. They fight over mystical flags, through a red and blue haze of constant reincarnation.\nLethal Conflict. An homage to the fighting games of the early 90s, this arena pits dungeoneers on a mutable 2D stage ready to chop, kick, flip, and stab their enemies. \nTomb of the Iron Lich. Deep inside the mithril-forged catacombs, Kaldun the Artificer-Paladin Lich pits adventurers against each other in a fight to the death amidst its Souldriver Four-Armed Iron Golem and the dreaded Deck of Mortals.\nSMASH. It\u2019s side-scrolling platform mayhem! Jockey over minimal ground, smash each other into the void, and avoid the shifting planar manifestations. \nDeath Wyverns Crucible.  Eight slabs of black marble jut from a lake of hissing dracolisk bile that surrounds this vast wrought-iron crucible. Pieces of bone float gingerly on the surface.  A toxic mist hangs around the cages. Winged shadows shriek and circle overhead. \nAmbulatory of Sorrow by Sersa Victory. Deep within the Abyss lairs the Succubus Queen, the most fecund of all demons. Run and slay as fast as you can or be nourishment for her next brood.\nVault of the Spider Queen. They who incubate the dark egg of the underworld gain the blessings of the Demonweb Pits, but at a perilous cost.\nAstral Ambush. In the grim darkness of the astral sea, there is only death. Grab a plasma rifle fight the invading boarding party. Don't get sucked into the cold void of space!\nStrike The Earth. Deep in the adamantium mines, ride the fast-moving minecart and arm yourself with weapons  of the highest craft-dwarf-ship to win the day ere the werebeasts get hungry.\nMutiny on the Hellstrider by Roving Band of Misfits. Arrr, me mateys! Sail upon the magma sea and fight over control of the HMS Hellstrider!\nTerror Core. A hex-based fight crawling on the walls of a radioactive nuclear core meltdown. Random mutations twist players' character sheets in unpredictable, devastating ways.\nSlaughterhouse\nKICKSTARTER CAMPAIGN\n5TDM has been in development for several years and has been extensively playtested.

Your pledges will be used to elevate Team Deathmatch to a real product and the fulfillment of our years-long dreams.\nEditing. The game text, including rules for all twenty arenas, is complete.

Dear Reader,\nThe Forest Hymn & Picnic is a forthcoming tabletop adventure game set across the backdrop of a very absurd, unending and often haunted forest. Players take up the lives of oddballs in The Forest Hymn\u2014precocious Animal Folk, lost People, or costumed Ghosts\u2014as they stumble upon trouble in the strange woods. Take on work in town and get to know the neighbors, investigate the supernatural, take a spot in the brass band, explore the ruins that litter the woods or even win a dance marathon at the county fair! This role playing game is best played in 2 to 4 hour sessions by folks ages 13 and up.\nThis RPG is heavily inspired by the following sweethearts:\nThe illustrations and literary works of Arnold Lobel: Frog & Toad, etcetera\n The Wind In The Willows by Kenneth Grahame\nThe more outlandish bits of the 100 Acre Wood as told by A. A. Milne \n Over The Garden Wall by Patrick McHale\nA certain animated film from 1949 based on Washington Irving's The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow \n The Skeleton Dance by Ub Iwerks\u2014specifically the 1929 version in both black and white!\nStories allegedly told by the Greek fabulist Aesop \nThe music of The Decemberists \nClick this fine picnicker to read about the types of Forest Dwellers and make your own adventurer!\nBetween its pages, The Forest Hymn & Picnic runs a heavily modified version of the very well loved, very brilliantly engineered system from Robert J. Schwalb's Shadow of the Demon Lord. It's a set of rules that champions ease of use, simple maths, and a progression system that gives players a near endless supply of options in creating unique characters through the course of play. The Forest Hymn & Picnic keeps all of that in its pocket while making the changes needed to fit this setting\u2014simplified magic, abstract wealth, and new inventory rules are some of the biggest changes.\nYou don't need to have read or own SotDL to play in The Forest Hymn. This is a complete game all in a single book! Here are a few things you'll find:\n Unique adventurer personalities: players use personality tables to stack the building blocks of their odd adventurers before making them their own. Play a Frog who constantly loses his shoes and loves to gamble, a Person who was raised by wolves and wants to win a pie eating contest, or a Ghost who plays the trumpet and is full of hard candies!\n Episodic play with milestone leveling-up: at-the-table gameplay focuses on the adventure or story at hand but time passes in woods. After each session, adventurers level up and players make choices that tell the story of their forest dweller's life between adventures. Take up as a fortune teller's apprentice and learn a magic trick or two or even waste your days and pennies away as a rakehell, bothering people for the sheer fun of it. The Forest Hymn & Picnic plays well as one-shots or as a campaign of ten sessions.\n Simple dice mechanic: whenever the outcome of a player's action is murky and unknowable, roll a single twenty sided die, add a simple modifier and any d6 gifts or d6 gags you have from your good\u2014or bad!\u2014grades. The results help tell a story of the very good times or a very bad, no-good horrible day.\n Seasonal magic tricks: magic works in odd ways in The Forest Hymn and the time of year in the woods effects how magic works. Keeping track of an adventurer's tricks is as simple as knowing what season it is. A spell that lets an adventurer grow three times their size might work beautifully in the spring but in autumn it might shrink them to a third of their size!\n A menagerie of games to play: minigames pepper the game's rules, allowing narrators to quickly resolve broader actions such as telling spooky stories, fishing, sack races, dance marathons and much more. These minigames give players and narrators opportunities to pause their shenanigans in town and getting lost in the woods to try out something a little different.\nCheck out the character sheet, in both Fine Black & White and Fancy Printer Destroying versions! Here is an example sheet, filled out. I spelled sandwiches wrong because that's what my character would do. The blank spot on the back of the sheet provides ample room to jot down notes, doodle pictures, or record your backstory.\nIf you were to hop in a pedal-powered balloon for a lazy afternoon tour of The Forest Hymn, you'd look out and see nothing but trees from one edge of the horizon to the other. Occasionally a hill peppered with small hamlets and farms would rise above the greenery like a lump in a warm quilt. From your balloon you might spy the busy forest dwellers scurrying and getting their day's affairs in order. You might spot them spreading blankets on the ground and unpacking baskets of tea and sandwiches, haggling over the penny cost of some overlarge vegetable or even see them dancing around the maypole.\nHowever, if you instead go for a walk in the woods rather than flying above it you'd see no end of absurdity, including:\n Wisps stalking the scene of a pie cooling in a window.\nForest dwellers searching by lantern for children lost in the woods.\nRuined places haunted by monsters and hiding rare treasures.\nWitches zooming over the ever-dangerous Spookwood looking for rare flowers.\nSkeleton bands practicing their funeral numbers in long abandoned cemeteries.\nThe Stork, drunk and trying to convince some forest dweller to take in an orphaned child.\nBoarding homes teeming with adventurers, song, and dance.\n Candy shoppes, fairs, maypoles, corn mazes, haunted mansions, magic tricks, bad weather, good weather and more!\nClick the spooky tree to read more about The Spookwood and make your own Monsters!\nDearest reader this brings us to the most important thing, the reason I've brought The Forest Hymn & Picnic to Kickstarter. This game needs a warm blanket to wrap itself in! Specifically it needs to be printed on 208 pages of thick, 70# uncoated paper in full color and tucked into a 6x9 cover of black pearl linen and stamped with white/silver foil. But that costs money, and so do the artists. So help me raise the funds for paying these very talented, young, good looking and fast running people to help me make the book!\nFor this book, I will be painting backgrounds and environments in mixed mediums and handing them off to Sam and Casey to decorate in their own styles to give the book an old cartoon feel. The process looks something like this:\nNo good fiction about forests comes without a song or two to hum when you're lost and Gabe Soria\u2014a writer of many good fictions\u2014has contributed a song to the beginning of each chapter. Some songs might even come with a score! For example, here is The Birthing Day song arranged for pots and pans and broken bottles.\nBy now you've probably had a gander at the backer levels offered at this project. Here is some import things to know about shipping:\n All backers at $15 USD or more will receive stretch goals! Yay!\n Digital goods, including any unlocked stretch goals will be delivered via DriveThruRPG. You'll get a survey at the end of the asking for the email address you would like to use for this.\n Shipping will be collected separately. You will receive an email that will take you to a store front where you can put in your address, and pay the appropriate shipping cost. Again, shipping costs for printed books is separate from your pledge level. Inside the United States you can expect shipping to cost anywhere from 3 to 6 US dollars for Media Mail. We'll make sure your book is snuggled up.\n International fulfillment will be handled by our friends at the Melsonian Arts Council. Daniel has an excellent track record when it comes to not only running successful Kickstarter campaigns, but shipping on time. CONE will eat the cost of freighting overseas books to Daniel in bulk. This should ease the cost usually associated with international shipping. Because of transit times, international backers will be receiving their books a bit later. Backers will get a choice to receive their books from Nashville, TN or London, UK.\nIn these trying times of galactic trade wars an uncertain port blockades, I only ask that international backers exercise patience.\nThis Kickstarter will pay for a very limited print run of 1500 books. There are exactly 1,000 books available through this campaign. I'll be holding on to the remaining books to account for transit damages, lost books and other disasters, contributor, press, and one for my mom copies. After the dust settles any remaining inventory will go up for sale.\nThe Forest Hymn & Picnic is written and decorated by me, Cecil Howe; artist, creator and co-designer of the Gold ENnie Award winning Hex Kit as well as the writer and illustrator of 2016's survival misery simulator Do Not Let Us Die In The Dark Night Of This Cold Winter. He'll be joined by fresh-faced artist Casey Cookson and industry veteran Sam Mameli, SotDL editor and proofreader Jay Spight with contributions from novel and graphic novel author, and all-around hero, Gabe Soria. In addition to those suckers, game design geniuses Robert J. Schwalb and Brad Murray will be or have already been forced to consult on this project.\nThis game couldn't happen without the love, support, occasional nay-saying, and advice of the RPG Talk family. Or the darlings that hang out in the Kill 6 Billion Demons Patreon discord.\nA long form pitch, random sights in The Forest Hymn, and closer look at People, Animal Folk, and Ghosts can all be found at https://www.theforesthymn.com.\nTable Top Babble host James Introcaso was gracious enough to have me on Episode #90 of their great podcast, where I talk at length about The Forest Hymn & Picnic. You can find it here: https://dontsplitthepodcastnetwork.com/table-top-babble/090.\nMany questions have been asked and answered in the FAQ section of this campaign, which can be found right here.\nAlternatively, you can find me on Twitter and follow along there!\nLove,\nCecil Howe, September 2018\nIn the event that this Kickstarter campaign raises an overabundance of funds I will begin to spend the cash lavishly on producing more The Forest Hymn & Picnic goodies.\n At 22,000 dollars raised Gabe Soria and I will work together to produce a supplemental book detailing a sea rumored to surround The Forest Hymn. It will contain new player options and spells for sailing the high sea! To be delivered as a PDF via DriveThruRPG.\n At 25,000 dollars raised I will illustrate a set of top-down style tiles unique to The Forest Hymn, compatible with the really cool mapping software Hex Kit. Delivered via DriveThruRPG. To be delivered as a PDF via DriveThruRPG.\n At 29,000 dollars raised Sam and Casey and I will work together to make a deck of 52 NPC cards for on-the-fly foolery at your table! *Important! If this goal is reached this deck of cards will be printed through DriveThruRPG. Backers will receive a coupon to get their cards at the cost of production and shipping. This is the safest way to make sure I do not bork this stretch goal.\n At 34,000 dollars raised I will produce a collection of 10 adventures for The Forest Hymn & Picnic! It will have many fun things and many fine decorations! To be delivered as a PDF via DriveThruRPG.\n At 40,000 dollars raised I will produce a two player, print & play tabletop skirmish game set in The Forest Hymn. Battle For The Bridge is a tale of two marching bands vying for the right to perform at the opening ceremony for a new covered bridge. Game play centers around preparing your band and racing your competitor to the bridge while using your instruments to thwart your enemy! To be delivered as a PDF via DriveThruRPG.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLife finds a way, a way to break as many things as possible. To soften whatever blow that might come up I've set my aims on an end'o'January release but hope to make this happen sooner than that. The game is written and is in the process of being fine tuned and made ready to go to the editor, nearly every chapter song is written, and the artists are simply waiting for me to prove I have the cash to pay them to get to work.\n\nThat being said, the biggest risk to this project is a breakdown in shipping. I tried to find a states-based printer willing to work with me on price and materials to get the book I want but in the end the printer I chose is located in Canada. They have an A+ track record, including printing several RPG books, and have kept the retail price of this book from crossing 60 USD. But the future of trade agreements is murky, and there might be hiccups at customs as a result. Rest assured I am watching carefully and leaving room to breathe.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "The Whisper Level", "descp": "Back at this level to receive backer updates and notifications about the campaign.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}], "stat": ["19 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "A Digital Book", "descp": "A PDF copy of the final book, plus digital copies of each stretch goal!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}], "stat": ["252 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "A Book Of Your Own", "descp": "Get physical and digital copies of the book, and digital copies of each stretch goal unlocked!\nShipping for this is collected separately; read the \"Fulfillment\" section for more information.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}], "stat": ["482 backers", "Limited (418 left of 900)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Love Letter Backer!", "descp": "Back at this level because you're in love with the game want to help out a bit more and you'll get your name attached to a location on a map of The Forest Hymn, printed on the book's end sheets.

The Demon Lord, an entity of incalculable power blights the lands with cursed evil, madness and slaughter. The dreadful beings let loose by the Demon Lord reflects this being\u2019s nightmarish essence, the touch of its shadow and its insatiable hunger for all things. \nAlthough the Demon Lord remains outside the mortal view, every new horror connected to him arises from the dirt and bring destruction and new death, also weakening little by little his planar prison, unchaining the constraints that are preventing him to escape the Void and bring catastrophic destruction to the world.\nRobert Schwalb create a world facing the total annihilation, its lands torn asunder by war, plague, and ancient horrors. Urth, the world of Shadow of the Demon Lord, is one of many imperiled by the shadowy menace lurking without and in this game you can play through its final days as embattled survivors fighting against what to many seems to be an inevitable end. \nA complete role playing game in one book, Shadow of the Demon Lord contains everything you need to create characters to confront the hordes of demons spilling in from the Void and to create and play through exciting stories steeped in horror and violence. To make this happen, the game system is easy to learn, plays fast, and requires little preparation to play. All these ensure both novice and veteran players can enjoy the game together. The benefit of short campaigns lets you tell more stories, create more characters, and experience more of the game's options than other game before. As a player, you are encouraged to play several heroes, trying the potential of the path\u2019s engine to create incredible flexible characters. And, as a Game Master, you can run a complete campaign in lesser time than usual, introducing new ideas, places and horrors every time. \nThe horror is perfect when is narrated in short stories, full of madness and fear. These are the only stories that thrive you at night and remain in your memories for long time.\nBlackStar is a whole new game line based on Shadow of the Demon Lord RPG, originally designed and created by Robert Schwalb. Death & Decay, our first release, will depict and introduce new monsters and develop exciting new ways to add fun and terror to the creatures you already know. It will be an immersive, dark fantasy supplement, that gives players and GMs alike new resources for their gaming sessions. \nYou will find plenty of undead out there ready to drain your last breath, coming from the Underworld itself or from the haunting darker places scattered through Urth.\nThe Creature Codex will be a 128 pages book that describes monsters of undeath, creatures of decay and lurking horrors. It presents many classical monsters revisited with new game options that can bring new excitement to your sessions, as well as plenty of new undead monsters of all types.\nFollowing are some of the unique features introduced in Death & Decay:\n\u2022 Presences: Infested dolls, whispers in the night, echoes of battles, doomed crypts and ghost ships! All of these entities can be found all around Urth. Infestations, apparitions, geists and malevolentes, all can be suppressed or banished forever. The task can be easy or hard, but presences might damn you for life. They can come back with renewed strength to drag you to the grave, corrupt your soul or lure you to the edge of insanity. Destroying them or survive can be the goal of an entire campaign. Death can be the minor evil. \n\u2022 Spirits: Spirits or incorporeal undead are a simple form of monsters that cannot follow the cycle of life and death on Urth. They nurture the evil in others and feed on the anguish they create in their victims, the sorrow they cause, the evil they plant, all to feed the Demon Lord and unchain him. Spectral beings and ghosts, shadows in the mists or wraiths can appear everywhere, in lost cairns or abandoned tombs, in attics or cellars, in ancient forests or in the crypt of an important church to carry victims with them and bring, as well, survivors to death in a slow agony for the madness they caused. Spirits alter the land they haunt, so be aware that banish a tortured soul from the living world can be the most terrific experience you may have in your entire life. \n\u2022 Corpses: Animated corpses, zombies, bone constructs, risen and others corporeal beings are the flesh of the hate that the demon lord feel toward the worlds of the livings. This contaminated corpses are risen by his foul cultists to generate waves of destruction, or they rise up by themselves to claim vengeance upon the mortals. Whatever the case, they are unstoppable, and their force can grow more than you can imagine in hordes capable of spread death and burning evil behind them.\n\u2022 Nightmares: Not sure if they are undead or dead at all, nightmares are the immortal visions of thousand mad minds and foul dreamers. A nightmare created lives in a limbo of nonexistence. However, their corruption and insanity can open the gates, and they will haunt dreams during the night; pervade the mind of anyone corrupted or mad so to overwhelm him by supernatural horrors. That said, be aware that your corrupted soul can strive you more than you have imagined until now.  \nAnd if you want more, be sure to support Death & Decay campaign. With your help, more creepy things will rise from the Void in Death & Decay, new forms of undead never seen before. We will investigate through the nature of Urth to find plants, malefic fungi and vermins that can cause decay to the living, or supernatural horrors from the Underworld and the Void. And of course, new players and GMs supplements, villains and adventures, and so on.\nAfter the initial goal is funded, here you will find a scheme of the backer levels with everything included in each pledge to easy understand what everyone will earn from the campaign.\n       Who is behind the veil of darkness?\nRobert J.

It will be USA-, EU-, Canada-, and Australia-friendly. As the production will be european we try to keep it simple, but international shipping can be heavy for a small company. Shipping rates can also rise after a campaign ends but before the games are ready to ship. So, about a month from shipping, we will assess and collect actual shipping costs. The upside is that you don\u2019t need to pay the full cost now. We also want to point out that we will try to sell BlackStar Death & Decay through distribution and into game and book stores after backers get their books.

Thank you so much!\nEVERY physical copy of Video Games and Pizza Parties will now come with the following:\n(Scroll down to see unlocked stretch goal rewards!)\nHi! I'm Sarah Graley and I'm the creator of Our Super Adventure, a diary webcomic about living with four cats and a cat-like boy! I love drawing the moments in life that make my heart go mushy, and the moments that make me laugh! You can read some of my diary comics over at Webtoon!\n\nI also write and draw comics like Kim Reaper & Rick and Morty: Lil' Poopy Superstar for Oni Press, and Glitch for Scholastic Graphix (out in 2019!).\nBack in 2015, I ran a successful Kickstarter for the first Our Super Adventure hardback collection, and now I'm back to to ask for your help to kickstart the second hardback collection: Our Super Adventure: Video Games and Pizza Parties!\nThe goal of this project is to fund a beautiful full colour hardback collection of 200 comics drawn over the past three years, which have never been in print before! Around a third of the comics will be book-exclusive too! \nThis time I want to make the book better than ever with a really nice printed cloth spine! It's going to the best Our Super Adventure book so far and I need you to help me to make it happen!\nOur Super Adventure is a diary comic all about me, Sarah, and my everyday life with my partner, Stef, and our four cats - Pesto, Toby, Wilson and Pixel! We joke about a whole bunch with one another and we've got a shared love of videogames, music and pizza! \nI started making these comics as a way of keeping track of various sweet or funny moments that happened, and since starting to post them online five years ago, they seem to have found their way to so many other people who have had similar sweet moments in their own lives and relationships! \nWe always thought we were kinda silly - we're definitely in the adult phase of our lives but at the same time we don't really feel like adults - but after hundreds of conversations with like-minded people at comic conventions and online, maybe we're all a little bit silly in the same way?\nOur cats are a massive part of our lives, and naturally they're a huge part of the comics as well! We've had four cats for the last four years, and we love them all so, so much. If we're ever having a quiet moment, normally it doesn't take long for one of them to track us down and hang out with us. (If they aren't too busy causing trouble with each other of course!) \nIn the last three years since I kickstarted Our Super Adventure, we've travelled out to numerous overseas comic conventions, moved house, and we've even started working together! Even more recently, we made another big leap of sorts too: \nSo here we are! Almost three years to the day that I started the Kickstarter for Our Super Adventure, we're here to try and get a really lovely 2nd collection together, collecting Our Super Adventure comics from 2015-2018. We're calling it Our Super Adventure: Video Games and Pizza Parties. \nFor this Kickstarter project, we want to collect all of the Our Super Adventure strips posted online between 2015 and 2018 (except for the Our Super American Adventure ones, they've got their own book already!), and combine those with over 60 brand new never-been-online comics to make another collection of 200 Our Super Adventure comics! \nThis time around we want to make a really special first edition print run of the book. We're looking at getting the book made with a printed cloth spine, and it's going to look incredible!\nWe're also going to try and put in some extra features too - we've got ideas for some bonus stretch goal pages involving the cats, photo collages of what we've been up to since the first book came out, and maybe even getting Stef to draw and colour a whole Our Super Adventure comic! \nWe love making these physical comic collections - we really like the idea that in an age where comics can be found and read online so easily, the physical book should be as nice as it can be! With my first Kickstarter back in 2015, I got to make a really nice 200 page hardback book for Our Super Adventure, and it literally wouldn't have happened without the wonderful support of all of the Kickstarter backers on that project!\nSo, we're back on Kickstarter for Our Super Adventure: Video Games and Pizza Parties, because we want to make this collection as nice it as can be, and we totally need your help to make it happen!\nWe also want to make some other Kickstarter exclusive things, like signed and sketched bookplates, new enamel pins, and t-shirts too!\nThe Our Super Adventure: Video Games and Pizza Parties 1st Edition book will be a square 16.5 x 16.5cm (inside pages 15.5 x 15.5cm) hardback with a printed yellow cloth spine. It's a book finish we've seen a few times and we've always been really impressed by how nice it looks - we're really looking forward to getting to see these books in person!\n\nThe book will contain 200 Our Super Adventure comic strips - That's all the comics posted online between 2015 and 2018 (except for the Our Super American Adventure comics which have their own book already!), and around 60 Our Super Adventure comics which are book exclusive! The book should be around 224 pages long. \nThe book will be full colour, and we've gone back and relettered some of the earlier strips so everything looks super nice and consistent! I also redrew some of the earlier comics too - I was just getting used to my new setup at the time and some of the colours and art looked a bit weird. These original versions will live on forever online, but I wanted to make sure that everything in the book looked as good as it could be! \nAll books will be signed!\nThe bookplate is something a bit more special for your book! This is an 8cm x 11cm bookplate that will be signed, personalised and sketched on, and then stuck into the front of the book! If you want the personal touch, this is the reward for you! \nI love making hard enamel pins, and I've designed a special set for this Kickstarter - a gold and white Our Super Adventure speech bubble pin, and a gold and black Toby pin! \nThis Kickstarter-exclusive t-shirt design is the first 3 colour screen print t-shirt that I've ever designed! We're using Gildan Softstyle t-shirts, they're lightweight and good quality! (Sizes available - Unisex S - 3XL) \nIf you don't already have the first Our Super Adventure book, you can totally get it as part of this Kickstarter campaign too! Both books are the same size, so they should look great on a shelf together. This book features 200 Our Super Adventure strips as well, in a hardback book with gold foiling detail on the cover. \nLIMITED SPACES - ALL SPACES FULL\nFor this special reward, I'll draw you your own Our Super Adventure comic strip! It can feature you, your loved ones, your pets, whoever you like! You can tell me what you want to happen in the four panels, and I'll make it happen!\nI do all my art digitally, so I'll send you both the finished digital file, and also print it and send it to you as well!\n\n(NOTE: Nothing rude, nothing hateful/offensive, and artist's opinion is final.)\n UNLOCKED SO FAR:\nNote: All images shown on this page are mockups of what the final books/pins/t-shirts will look like - final artwork may differ slightly!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're going to be working with the amazing Oni Press for a retail release of this book in mid-2019, but we wanted to do something special to show our thanks to all of our fans and readers who've been supporting us over the last five years! Because of you, we've been able to keep making comics and post them online! \n\nThis campaign will fund this special First Edition print run, and we'll be sending out all the books to you directly!\n\nWe\u2019ve got regular suppliers that we use for pins and t-shirts and they make good quality things and deliver on time so we\u2019re confident about using them.\n\nWe\u2019re using a new book printer and we\u2019re confident that the books will look amazing! They\u2019ve used similar finishes on projects before and the delivery times that we\u2019ve been quoted mean the books should be in our hands super quickly for us to get them sent out to our awesome backers!\n\nWe\u2019re using itch.io to deliver all digital rewards and they\u2019ve got a great track record for digital stuff so that should all go smoothly too.\n\nIf we hit any snags, we'll keep everyone up to date with constant updates!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a310 or more", "title": "Super Robot Adventurer", "descp": "Video Games and Pizza Parties - The digital eBook\nINCLUDES:\nVideo Games and Pizza Parties PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2018"}], "stat": ["20 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a315 or more", "title": "Super Book Adventurer", "descp": "Video Games and Pizza Parties - The Book\nINCLUDES:\nVideo Games and Pizza Parties - 1st Edition Signed Hardback\nVideo Games and Pizza Parties PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["383 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a320 or more", "title": "Super All Robots Adventurer", "descp": "Video Games and Pizza Parties - The digital book, as well as digital versions of Our Super Adventure, Our Super American Adventure, and the three original black and white collections!\nINCLUDES:\nVideo Games and Pizza Parties PDF\nOur Super Adventure Digital PDF Collection", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2018"}], "stat": ["34 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a325 or more", "title": "Super Signed and Sketched Adventurer", "descp": "Video Games and Pizza Parties - The Book and the signed and sketched Bookplate (+ digital collection)\nINCLUDES:\n1 X Kickstarter Exclusive Signed and Sketched Bookplate\nVideo Games and Pizza Parties - 1st Edition Signed Hardback\nVideo Games and Pizza Parties PDF\nOur Super Adventure Digital PDF Collection", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["105 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a325 or more", "title": "Super Both Books Adventurer", "descp": "Both books - Video Games and Pizza Parties and Our Super Adventure.

This new set focuses upon signs of the seasons, planetary metals, and eventually, symbols of unique occult significance. \nThe Great Work begins anew with two symbols of traditional alchemy, Autumn and Silver presented as 1.5\" soft enamel lapel pins. These pins combine a black soft enamel with a shining nickel finish to make stylish and subtle accessories to any ensemble. This set will also feature double pin posts for superior stability. They will be shipped to you on a backing card bearing the Strix Publishing logo, appropriate for gift giving.\nThis will be a short, 3-week campaign in the hope of having these pins ship to backers in time for the holiday season this December. As such, it will be important that backers submit their survey as soon as possible upon completion of the campaign so we can place our order.\n9 additional, original symbols may be unlocked as stretch goals over the course of this campaign, the first of which will be revealed upon reaching our funding goal of $2,100.\nUPDATE: Due to popular demand the previously funded Sulfur (Leviathan Cross) and Mercury symbols are now also available via the Kickstarter!\n  Medieval alchemists used symbols in their notes as short hand for complex ideas. Autumn could be inscribed to represent the transition in temperature from hot to cold, to describe a bountiful harvest reaped from previous alchemical process, or simply to represent the time of autumn as the most auspicious for beginning a work.\nSilver is one of the seven planetary metals of alchemy, and is associated with the moon, also called Luna, in astrology. This metal and its symbol are believed to have feminine qualities and are associated with purity in both alchemical process and as a state-of-mind. In astrological terms, silver is also associated with the Roman goddess, Diana, goddess of the moon and the Hunt.\nSulfur is also one of the tria prima, the fundamental aspects of human identity as defined by the alchemist Paracelsus. Sulfur was believed to embody the emotions and desires of humanity, separate from the higher faculties of the spirit. This variant of the sulfur symbol is also known as the Leviathan Cross. \nCalled \u201cquicksilver\u201d by the ancients, mercury is one of the three primes of alchemy and one of the seven planetary metals. Associated with spirit, mercury represents the transcendence of states. Mercury is both solid and liquid, heaven and earth.\nThe strix was a flesh eating bird of ill-omen, walking on four taloned legs, and bearing a razor-sharp beak, in the myths of the ancient Greeks. The earliest known tale of the strix is from Metamorphoses in which Polyphonte and her sons Agrios and Oreios were punished for acts of cannibalism. Polyphone was cursed to becom a creature \"that cries by night, without food or drink, with head below and tips of feet above, a harbinger of war and civil strife to men.\" References to the strix are found throughout the surviving works of antiquity through the days of the Roman Empire and survived into the middle ages, where its name became entangled with the Romanian word for vampire, strigoi, and creatures that scream in the night like the Strig\u0103t barn owl.\nThe original set of pins from the first Great Work Kickstarter are available now. All orders through the Strix Publishing web shop are 10% off through the end of this campaign on October 10th as a \"thank you\" for your support of The Great Work II: Seasons!\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere is always the possibility of delay when ordering from overseas manufacturers.

We're building something that is quick, efficient, and gives you a great looking map, but we need your help to finish the project. By backing this project you'll receive an amazing piece of software that does all this:\nFeatures:\nMulti Platform: Hex Kit runs native on Windows, Mac, and Linux.\nSimple to Use: It has just the right tools you need to quickly put together a detailed map, as well as a few tools for displaying your map at the table.\nDetail Variation: No need to hand pick each tile as you build your map; pick a hex style and the software randomizes the selection as you click and drag across the canvas. Tiles can be rotated and flipped with just a few mouse clicks as well. If you find the painting too broad, you can also select individual tiles.\nPlayer Facing Display: Hex Kit has a display mode that shows your map in a separate window; drag it to a second screen or show it on a projector. You can hide parts of the map with fog of war and reveal the map as needed. Changes made in paint mode update in the display window in real time. Did your players burn that village down? Delete it from the map, and it's gone.\nStore Information: You can store a label with a description for each hex directly in the map.\nCustom Tiles: Hex Kit comes with thousands of hand-drawn, hand-painted hex tiles, but you're not locked into them. Users can import custom hex tiles, and, by using a simple file structure new tiles can be randomized just like the others.\nExport: Hex Kit will export your map as a PNG file that you can print or even use with a virtual table top.\nRandom Maps: If you're in a hurry, or just want to goof off, you can generate a random map, and then edit it to fit your needs.\n  Each tile that comes with Hex Kit is made by hand. I stamp the outline on some thick paper, then draw and paint the features. There are already 1,300+ of these tiles available now, and I want to paint a minimum of 2,000 more to bundle with the software as part of this Kickstarter campaign. These will come in a variety of genres, including more fantasy tiles, modern tiles, as well as an entire new set of space and sci fi tiles called Spaceland.\nYou're not locked into the tiles that come with this Kickstarter. Hex Kit comes with a template that you can use to create your own tiles with the dimensions needed for compatibility, whether you paint your own tiles or edit public domain art.\nBecause we've funded well over 200% of our original goal, I will be illustrating an additional 1,000 hex tiles! Including Fantasyland, that brings the total number of tiles coming with this Kickstarter over 4,000.\nFor another look at the art and software in action check out this timelapse video:\n  fantasy map made in hex kit!\n    Why we need funding: I need to pay the engineers, Pierre and Ross, for their time and commitment to this project. This is, absolutely, the most important reason for Kickstarting Hex Kit. Next I need to pay a lawyer to craft up an EULA that protects the desktop app and the art, without being unreadable to anyone who isn't a lawyer. It is really important to me that everyone who uses Hex Kit knows, in plain English, what they can and cannot do with the art and the software. Shout out to the lawyer: Hi Joe!\nWhy you should back now instead of buy later: Hex Kit is not going to come bundled with all these cool hex tiles when we release it to the public. By joining early you're going to get the software and the tiles at a highly discounted price. When we upload 1.0 to itch.io for the public release, it will only come with some basic black and white tiles. In the future, packs of hex tiles will be sold separately from the desktop app.\nPledge Level 1, $10\nThis level is for those who've purchased Hex Kit Volume One: Fantasyland already. This product came out in August 2016 in various markets, and is already compatible with the Hex Kit desktop app. Pledging at this level will get you the software, the forthcoming Spaceland hex pack and 800+ new hex tiles. This pledge level does not come with the Fantasyland tiles.\nPledge Level 2, $20\nThis level gets you the Hex Kit desktop app and every single hex tile. It comes with Fantasyland, the forthcoming Spaceland, and 800+ new hexes. If you don't own any Hex Kit products already, this one is for you.\nPledge Level 3, $30\nThis level is for people who think the current offerings are too cheap, and want to give a little extra and get a little extra in return. By backing at this level you get the desktop app, all the hex tiles, and early access to beta builds of the app. The beta will be ready sometime in March and will work on Windows, Linux, and Mac PCs.\nThere are no stretch goals. We don't want to release Hex Kit as anything less than 100%. To avoid feature bloat, run a smooth campaign, and deliver the product on time, we've decided to keep our scope narrow. That being said, the more money this campaign raises, the more hex tiles I will make! So be sure to share this campaign with your friends, your mom, on twitter, facebook, instagram, and google+.\nhand-painted nebulae hex tiles, mid scan\n    Hex Kit works already. We have a working tech demo, or alpha version, that we've been developing for a couple of months now. This tech demo does almost everything we want the final product to do. If you've watched the videos and looked at the art on this page then you've seen it in action. Moving forward our biggest tasks include optimizing the software, tweaking the software's design and overall look, implementing random map generation and painting over 2,000 more hex tiles, \nOur internal deadline for Hex Kit 1.0 is April 2017. We are very confident that we will meet that deadline, if not beat it. Hex Kit will be delivered through itch.io, and when this campaign has ended we will be going forward with the Steam Greenlight process. All backers will receive keys for both delivery services. (Note: Since launching this campaign it has been announced that Greenlight is going away; we'll be pursuing whatever avenue needed to get Hex Kit on Steam)\nWe'll be updating the campaign once a week or more with progress updates, screenshots, and videos. We'll also be answering any questions you may have, fielding ideas for more hex tiles, and ensuring that you don't lose confidence in the project.\nBackers who own Hex Kit Volume One: Fantasyland will get instructions on how to install those tiles with the software before release. As well, we will be publishing the templates for creating your own hex tiles in the next few weeks, as we optimize map exporting.\nHex Kit is being engineered by Ross Squires, and Pierre Laferriere and illustrated by Cecil Howe. All three of us want to say THANK YOU.\nYou can follow me, Cecil, on Twitter and Google+, or check out my website. Ross is on Twitter too.

The working version of Hex Kit is almost feature complete, we're already moving towards optimization, QA testing, and further art development. Kickstarting Hex Kit gives us the funds we need to see focus on seeing this project all the way to the end.\n\nThat being said, we run the risk of hitting hiccups along the way. I'm the only person creating art for Hex Kit right now, and if I get sick or break my arms we'd be in trouble. Hex Kit is built to work on lots of art though, and the desktop app is completely functional with a complete set of over 1,300 hexes if something not-fun happens to me. As well, our team of engineers is very small. If Pierre or Ross break their arms, it could stretch out development time.\n\nWe are super confident, however, that given our momentum and current stage of production we will not run in to any development delays.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Hex Kit + New Tiles Only", "descp": "This pledge level comes with the Hex Kit desktop app and all new hexes.

From the moment Green Ronin Publishing revealed it in the adventure, Death in Freeport, it was clear this setting was unique--a pirate city on the edge of the known world, crawling with orcs, gangs, monsters, and servants of dark and maddening gods. Since that first adventure, Green Ronin has released a slew of support products, adding adventures and supplements that have brought this city to life. \nOne of the most appealing parts of Freeport, aside from all the blood, carnage, and madness, was how it could fit into any world by simply dropping it in on the edge of the map. When I was working at Green Ronin, we took this idea a step further and made it possible to drop the City of Adventure into any game by publishing The Pirate's Guide to Freeport--a system-neutral book that could be used with any game, from Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay to Rolemaster, and everything in between. In the Companion Series of Freeport books, the setting has been adapted for use in Savage Worlds, Pathfinder, Castles & Crusades, Fate, and more. Now it's time to bring this classic city to the world of the Demon Lord.\nIn 2015, I launched a successful Kickstarter campaign for Shadow of the Demon Lord, a horror fantasy roleplaying game set in the last days of a dying world. When building the setting for the game, I reserved a small spot for Freeport, a city that will always have a soft-spot in my cold, black heart. Now that I have shipped out all the rewards for Shadow and released 120 titles for the game (including adventures, card decks, sourcebooks, and more), I want to bring Freeport to my world and I need your help to do it.\nThe Shadow of the Demon Lord Freeport Companion will be loaded with goodies for any fan of the Demon Lord. Inside its pages, you'll find two new ancestries--the undine and the mysterious serpent people known as the Valossans. The book offers ten new expert and master paths, such as the drunken celebrant and the vicious pit fighter. Over thirty new spells join the game, all speaking to the darkness of the city and the sorts of adventures one might undertake in and around it. New gear and new rules for underwater exploration, voyages, and ship battles all help you run seafaring adventures in Shadow. This book gives you a ton of characters, relics, new monsters, and a big adventure you can use to kick off a new campaign. \nFor more information on the product, be sure to check out our website. \nIllustration by Jack Kaiser\n   As with my last Kickstarter campaign, I have everything written and ready to move into production. I'm just waiting on the funds to make this happen. I'll be using pledges to pay the editor, graphic designer, and artists for all new art to make this product as awesome and gorgeous as it deserves to be. So I could really use your help to bring this sourcebook out. All you need to do is choose one of the pledge levels on the right side of this page and you're done. As with any Kickstarter campaign, you pay nothing if the project doesn't fund. But if it does fund, you can rest assured that you'll get a kick-ass book that's loaded with great gaming content. \n    Not final cover\n  Not final layout\n      Not final layout\n  Shadow of the Demon Lord has a slew of great support products already, and now is a great time to get caught up on releases you might have missed.

I delivered everything promised in about 18 months from the funding date, and I over-delivered in most cases. The book is written and ready to go, so there will be no blown tires there. My team of editors, graphic designers, and artists are all experienced veterans and kick all the ass, so I don\u2019t anticipate trouble there. The only potential pitfall is getting approval from the printer. Sometimes, this can be a bit tricky, but we have a solid layout template that should sail through the approval process.

We've always wanted to make the process of editing your campaign pages much more organic and natural, and now we have the chance. Watch the video for a quick demo of what we mean by \"natural editing\"\nThere are some significant technical challenges here, which is why the stretch goal is so aggressive. I still think we can hit it, especially as we approach the final push that most Kickstarters get.\nAs with the other stretch goals, this will be a post-reforging target. My best estimate right now is that we can launch this sometime in December of 2013. I wish I could promise it sooner, but this gets to the very core of Obsidian Portal and I don't want to under-emphasize the difficulty.\nMega Stretch Goal - Extra Month at $75,000\nFor every $10k we raise over the initial goal, we will be able to extend the premium Ascendant time for every backer (Hasted Ascendant and above) by 1 month. We've already achieved 6 extra months! So get out there and tell your friends. The more backers we bring in, the more Ascendant time everyone gets!\nShe can't take much more, captain!\nUpdate - Additional Years Available\nBy popular demand, we're offering additional years as an add-on purchase. Simply pledge an additional $35 on top of your chosen backer level for each additional year you want. More details and examples down below the backer levels.\nStretch Goal #4 - Custom Campaign URLs - $50,000 - ACHIEVED\nPart of the reforging is an overhaul to make things look better, so we think everyone would like to make their page URLs look nicer as well. Every campaign will get its own subdomain (ie. \u201cmycampaign.obsidianportal.com\u201d) and Ascendant campaigns can set up their own raw domain (ie. \u201cmycampaign.com\u201d).\nThere will be significant technical challenges with this stretch goal, both in making sure that old URLs do not break and also making sure that all your old links to characters, wiki pages, items, and so forth automatically redirect to your new custom campaign URL. We don\u2019t want to underestimate the difficulty here, so as with our File Storage stretch goal, we\u2019re shooting to complete this stretch goal after the main reforging process. Our target date for the custom URLs would be mid-October 2013.\nStretch Goal #3 - File Storage Locker - $35,000 - ACHIEVED!\nWe\u2019ve always wanted to expand our image upload to include files of any type. Every campaign has files they need to share, like PDFs of your world\u2019s history or MP3s of your campaign theme music. If we hit this stretch goal we can add a spot in every campaign to store and manage all your shared files, so it\u2019s easier to keep all your campaign materials in one place.\nPlus, if we can hit this stretch goal, we will be able to increase the storage size limits for both free and Ascendant campaigns. The free limit will climb to 250MB and the Ascendant limit will rise to 10GB. That should be plenty of space to share everything your group needs.\nNote: For this and all future stretch goals, we are targeting a post-August release date. We will do our best to get as much completed as we can by August, but we want to be realistic and open about our timelines. For the file storage locker, we\u2019re aiming for sometime in September.\nStretch Goal #2 - Names! Names! Names! - $20,000 - ACHIEVED!\nSince the beginning, I've wanted a good, solid random name generator as part of the character creation and management. So many times I've been staring at my players, mouth hanging open, waiting for a name to come out. They had asked about an NPC I hadn't prepared, and I just needed a name. Here, let me explain:\nSo what are the particulars of the name generator?\nA variety of different naming \"genres\". You'll be able to quickly switch between Elven-ish, Dwarven, guttural Ork (think lots of Ks and Xs), and so forth.\nFast! - It will be right there when you need it, ready to give you the name you need and keep your players in the game.\nIntegrated - Instead of just spitting a name at you, you'll be able to create a new barebones character on the fly with the name pre-generated. So, when your players ask about that random new NPC 3 months later, they will be tracked normally in Obsidian Portal, just like all your other characters.\n\nStretch Goal #1 - Reworking the Maps - $10,000 - ACHIEVED\nThe campaign maps have been one of our favorite features since the beginning, but just like everything else, they need some work to make them better! If we hit this goal, we will be able to make the following improvements:\nDeeper zoom levels for Ascendant maps - 5 instead of the current 3\nHigher resolution images - 4096x4096 pixels instead of the current 1024x1024\nA library of map markers - Different colors and shapes. Imagine dropping crossed swords to mark a battle, a tower to mark a wizard's abode, and a cave for...a cave. That's the idea.\nBetter connection with the rest of your campaign - Add markers for specific characters and/or wiki pages, instead of only the general purpose markers we have now.\nThe maps are already fun. Now let's reforge them into something truly useful and awesome!\nObsidian Portal Reforged\nObsidian Portal is the award-winning online campaign management system for tabletop role-playing games. We want to revitalize the existing Obsidian Portal by increasing its functionality, adding new features, and cleaning up the design. We are taking the strong core that is Obsidian Portal, heating it up in the furnace, and reforming it into a sleeker and sharper tool. A better Obsidian Portal will make your life easier as a game master, which will make your game the best it can be. That\u2019s what \u201creforging\u201d is all about.\nImprovements\nTo provide you with the best possible experience, we\u2019ll revamp the most frequently used parts of the site and rework them so that they\u2019re easier to use. We will be examining every page for ways to make them flow better, provide the information you need, and allow you to navigate and manage your campaign faster and easier. The redesign will add more features to enhance your gaming.\nA perfect example of this is our plan to create a campaign dashboard that will put the most important details of your campaign right at your fingertips. The dashboard is just the first of many changes that will fundamentally enhance Obsidian Portal and make it a much better tool than it is today.\nA very rough draft of the new dashboard\nWe\u2019ll be supporting these functional changes by improving the overall design of the site. We\u2019ll take our current site and give it a consistent look and feel that will make it more intuitive to use\u2014not a button here and a link there, but a cohesive design strategy.\nWith more of your support, there\u2019s even more we can do to make Obsidian Portal the most robust campaign management system. If we make our original goal, keep an eye out for stretch goals for additional improvements.\nBack us now and get a year of premium Ascendant membership at a reduced price when you back at the Ascendant level.\nWhy Obsidian Portal?\nIt\u2019s free to use and built from the ground up, for gamers by gamers. We host a huge community of tabletop RPG players who are all looking to get the most out of their tabletop gaming experience. You play your campaign and we help you manage it. It\u2019s that simple.\nWith Obsidian Portal, you can manage your tabletop RPG campaign from any computer, anywhere. You can tell your story and get recognized for your innovation and creativity. Now help us take Obsidian Portal to the next level!\nBenefits to Backers\nA year of premium Ascendant membership (Hasted Ascendant level and above). Not a GM yourself? No worries, the Ascendant time can be gifted to your GM!\nCool backer-only souvenirs like campaign maps, custom map markers, profile badges, t-shirts, letterpress cards, and more\nThe opportunity to have a hand in the reforging process. All backers will receive developer updates along the way for an exclusive look at the design process. Plus, Tinkerer Ascendant level and above will be able to provide feedback during the design and beta testing.\nA slicker, more useful, easier to navigate Obsidian Portal. A better Obsidian Portal will make your life easier as a game master and improve your game.\n\nMy Backstory\nWhen I started Obsidian Portal in 2006, I knew I needed to set aside some real time and focus hard to make progress. To accomplish this, I quit playing video games altogether and told myself I wouldn't play again until the site launched. If you're a gamer like me, then you know how hard that is, and also how much time that can free up. I accomplished some amazing things in those first 9 months, and it's thanks to that dedication that Obsidian Portal is where it's at now.\nFast forward to now. Over the summer, I have the chance to focus on Obsidian Portal almost full time. Plus, I have a team of designers and programmers lined up to help out. So, in the spirit of what it took to launch, I'm once again swearing off video games and putting my nose to the grindstone. It will be a hot and sweaty summer, but by GenCon in August we will have some awesome progress to show for it!\nYou've seen what I can do by myself on nights and weekends. Now let me show you how awesome we can be with a real team working near full time!\nBacker Level Details\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\n\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\nA badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a Reforger.\n\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\nA badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a Reforger.\nA postcard thanking you for supporting us in the Reforging process.\n\nExample of the finished postcard thank you\n\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\nA badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a Reforger.\nA postcard thanking you for supporting us in the Reforging process.\n1 year of Ascendant subscription time (a 20% discount off the normal price of $39.99/yr) - You can choose to redeem the subscription time immediately following the Kickstarter or wait until the Reforging is complete in August.\n\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\nA badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a Reforger.\nA postcard thanking you for supporting us in the Reforging process.\n1 year of Ascendant subscription time (a 12.5% discount off the normal price of $39.99/yr) - You can choose to redeem the subscription time immediately following the Kickstarter or wait until the Reforging is complete in August.\n\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\nA badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a Reforger.\nA postcard thanking you for supporting us in the Reforging process.\n1 year of Ascendant subscription time - You can choose to redeem the subscription time immediately following the Kickstarter or wait until the Reforging is complete in August.\nAccess to the beta forum to discuss the reforging and provide feedback as it progresses\nA special badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a core member of the Reforging process\n\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\nA badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a Reforger.\nA postcard thanking you for supporting us in the Reforging process.\n1 year of Ascendant subscription time - You can choose to redeem the subscription time immediately following the Kickstarter or wait until the Reforging is complete in August.\nAccess to the beta forum to discuss the reforging and provide feedback as it progresses\nA special badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a core member of the Reforging process\nA limited edition t-shirt available only to Reforger backers.\n\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\nA badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a Reforger.\nA postcard thanking you for supporting us in the Reforging process.\n1 year of Ascendant subscription time - You can choose to redeem the subscription time immediately following the Kickstarter or wait until the Reforging is complete in August.\nAccess to the beta forum to discuss the reforging and provide feedback as it progresses\nA special badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a core member of the Reforging process\nA limited edition t-shirt available only to Reforger backers.\nEarly access to the beta server to play with the updates and new features as they are developed.\nA handmade letterpress card inviting you to the beta program.\n\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\nA badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a Reforger.\nA postcard thanking you for supporting us in the Reforging process.\n1 year of Ascendant subscription time - You can choose to redeem the subscription time immediately following the Kickstarter or wait until the Reforging is complete in August.\nAccess to the beta forum to discuss the reforging and provide feedback as it progresses\nA special badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a core member of the Reforging process\nA limited edition t-shirt available only to Reforger backers.\nEarly access to the beta server to play with the updates and new features as they are developed.\nA handmade letterpress card inviting you to the beta program.\nA custom video made by the talented Mikhail Twarogowski, who composed our Kickstarter video for us.

I am coming to you and Kickstarter in the hopes of creating and producing a collection of comics, pulled from the first year of d20monkey. This is my first Kickstarter project and I'll be honest, I'm as nervous as a virgin at a prison rodeo. I'm sure once a few days pass, my nerves will settle down. sure they will. Hopefully, this grabs your attention and you'll read on to the campaign below. Thanks so much for your time.\nFor more information on d20monkey visit www.d20monkey.com\nd20Monkey: The Short Version\nd20Monkey focuses on the lives of gamers and longtime friends, Sam and Brett. Throughout the comics contained within you will experience gamer habits and culture, game sessions based on unlkely holidays, witness fist fights with Santa Claus, and the wrath of a heartbroken DM. However, the most important thing I hope to bring across with this collection is my lifelong love of gaming and comics, packaged in an all-in-one tome.\nWhat Makes First Edition Special?\nPrinted on high-quality paper, this 156 page of comic goodness measures 8\u201d x 8\u201d and collects every D20Monkey comic from October 2010 through November 2011. These comics include the first Christmas story, Sam\u2019s introduction to Larry the DM, and the Evil Sam storyline. Additionally, I am going back through the archives correcting typos and reformatting the earliest comics to match the size/format of the current comics. In addition to the reformatted comics, First Edition also contains over 40-pages of bonus content including early character sketches, designs, notes, and full character bios. I love webcomics and digital medium but there is just something special about holding a comic or trade paperback in your hands. I want this collection to be above and beyond anything you\u2019re expecting.\nI Cannot Do This Without You\nWith your support, I want to do all of the work to make d20Monkey: First Edition a reality. For any cartoonist, a collection of work is a major milestone and serves to set the pace for years to come. I want to be that guy and I am asking you to help make that happen. As many of you already know, printing (especially full-color printing) is not cheap. All funding received will directly support the printing, freight shipping to me (that is a huge chunk) and the delivery of d20Monkey: First Edition and rewards with an estimated February 2013 release.\nStretch Goals\nOkay guys! With the initial goal in the homestretch, here are the first Stretch Goals for the project. Some of which, I believe to be a nice mix of obtainable and ambitious.\nWhat are the Reward Levels?\nWOO!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLeading up to the launch of this campaign I've worked to reformat old comics for the book and the d20monkey site, as well as beginning the prep work needed to lay out the book. Over the course of the 30-day campaign, I will complete the layout process and additional content for the printer to roll into production as soon as possible. Regardless of whether or not the funding goal is met, I will have a full PDF ready to go. That said, there are a few things to keep in mind if the goal is met and the production process begins:\n\nThe books will be produced through a Canadian printer with overseas connections, resulting in an estimated 90-day turn around time for printing and freight shipment to my place here in Nashville. Granted, there are a lot of things that can hiccup along the way that are out of my hands (poor printing, shipping delays, etc) but I will not accept sub-standard quality of goods.\n\nHowever, I conducted a lot of research before beginning this project, as well as consulting with other comic publishers for printer recommendations. I feel confident in the printers ability to deliver a quality product on schedule. If something does go wrong, you will know first, along with the steps being taken to correct any issues.\n\nAll of the backer rewards will be handled by my proven sources for t-shirts and prints. I have worked with these vendors many times over and have zero concern in their ability to deliver quality products on time. In regards to the one-of-a-kind boner fairy doll, Designs by Anna has assured me that a February due date will not be an issue.\n\nI am a firm believer in constant communication and timely updates. As a backer, you will see the production process from start to finish and you will the first to know about any and all events during production. I want you to see where your dollars are going and share in the experience.\n\nI am excited to make this book (and the rewards) happen. I took the time to research printers and vendors capable of delivering the products I want to offer, with the highest possible quality. It is a scary and exciting process but I know that with my design/printing background and your support I can make this happen.\n\nThanks so much for your time and consideration.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #43", "update_userinfo": "Requiem Address Updates!", "update_content": "Helloooooooooo!\nThings are progressing nicely and an imminent goods arrival triggers the need for a call for address updates.\nIf you have moved since receiving your initial package of physical rewards, send me your current address via email at brian at d20monkey dot com with the subject line \"Requiem Address Update\".

The Village by the Sea is a beautiful, horrible place. And I want to take you there.\n\nThe Guide covers neighborhoods, families and coverups and over a hundred years of history, for a town that exists outside of time and place. This could be the town you stopped in as a child on your way to see family. It might be your hometown. This could even be the town just down the road from yours.\n\nThe Village by the Sea was founded on the coast in 1850. Its founding families still exert force on the course of Village history, its borders have crept over devoured nearby settlements, and its piers are washed in blood. The monuments to dead sailors cast shadows in the park. There are always new missing posters outside the market.\n\nThere is never a year without a candlelit vigil for the dead.\n\nI\u2019ve got the village in my blood. I may not be nice all the time, and days of cutesie teen detective work are long behind me. I may have issues, but letting people die isn\u2019t usually one of them. I came back here because I didn\u2019t have a choice, and writing the guide is all I have left.\n\n-\"The Guide to the Village by the Sea,\" Ashley Hart\n\n\nThis is a work of fiction, end to end. You can read it and walk away, or read it and bring your friends on a trip to the Village by the Sea. No matter what role-playing game system you pair the Guide to, That Which Sleeps Beneath will still be waiting.\nThe Guide to the Village by the Sea is a manual for surviving the coastal home of modern horror.\n\nI want to tell you this story. And I want to tell you about the people helping me.\n\nMy editor is Richard Dansky, who was the line developer for Wraith: The Oblivion, currently works at Ubisoft as the Central Clancy Writer. Lisa Grabenstetter, who has done work for everyone from museums to Crossed Genres, is the genius behind the seal of the Village, interior illustrations and art-related rewards. Sarah Troedson is my cartographer, and spends her days working as a GIS analyst.\n\nAs for me, I'm a horror writer and journalist raised in Washington State, which has one of the weirder and more gruesome histories of the territories. I've published a number of strange stories with some very lovely people; The Edge of Propinquity took my first Jewish horror story, and The Irish Times took a shine to a ghost story that grew out of a childhood with my Irish Gram.\nI'm also synesthetic; my senses cross-wire and trigger in overlapping ways. The whole world has tastes, smells, colours and textures for me that are wildly different than one sense tells me. My eyes tell me green but my mouth says something green can taste pink. Fire alarms are painful and echoes can stretch like fun-house mirrors. This is my first book where I leave those sensory impressions in, and get to write in a way that's normal for me. The narrator of the Guide has synesthesia, and it literally colours her perceptions.\n\nWhen you back the Guide, you\u2019re coming for a visit. You\u2019re becoming a part of it, burrowing into every dark shadow and corrupt garden party the Village has to offer. And you get to borrow someone else's senses while you do.\n\nI hope you enjoy your stay.\nVideo Editing: Jeremy Keller.\nAutographing E-Books: Since I've had a few questions about it, I wanted to clear up some confusion. Yes, you can totally autograph an e-book. Kindlegraph and MyWrite are just two ways that writers can autograph an electronic eddition of a book, as well as the hardcore method of hand-scanning signatures and generating unique copies of the e-book, one at a time.\n\nThe $15.00 reward really does include an autographed electronic copy of the Guide, it's not a typo referring to a softcover.\nReward Changes:\nArt\n$100 pledges will now receive a signed, limited edition art print of the village seal\n\n$200 pledges will now receive a signed, personalized map of the Village from Sarah Troedson and I.\n\nLeonard Balsera will be writing \"Injured Coast,\" a Fiasco playset set in the Village by the Sea.\n\nStretch Goal $5,500: Stephen Blackmoore (CITY OF THE LOST, DEAD THINGS (Feb - 2013), KHAN OF MARS (2013) and Will Hindmarch (Thackery T.

Perhaps you\u2019re more comfortable on the deck of a ship, fighting with the constant motion of the Corsair? \nNew Gearforged Options: An update to the original gearforged mechanics in Kobold Quarterly #16, we present new racial utility powers like the mysterious Rava\u2019s Vision and the dreaded Wraith Form! \nSchools of Magic: The Clockwork and Ink schools give mages the tools they need to conjure gears and write your own destiny. \nBackgrounds: Sampling the most common areas of Midgard that a hero might hail from. \nEquipment: It may be mundane to some folk of Midgard, but you won\u2019t find this stuff in the markets of other settings. \nDefenders of Midgard will have the same professional editing and layout as the Midgard Bestiary.\nBackers at the Fellforged Level and above will receive the Defenders of Midgard PDF if we reach this stretch goal, and all backers will receive a PDF of Kobold Quarterly #16. \nIf the Bestiary Reaches $10,000\nWe\u2019re going to push for one last goal. If we hit $10,000 in pledges, the Defenders of Midgard print run will be extended quite a bit. Previously only available to Cave Dragon backers and above, it will now be part of goals for backers starting at the IRON GHOUL level ($35). \nIn addition, we\u2019ll be commissioning a new piece of fantastic art to grace the cover so even our highest tier backers will benefit from a better all-around product, we'll ask our biggest backers for a few items to include in it--and we'll struggle mightily to secure a special introduction or essay on design from a former Wizards designer.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #21", "update_userinfo": "Mini-Adventures Complete", "update_content": "It took longer than expected, but the Defenders of Midgard PDF has been sent out to all Fellforged-level backers, and it is now also available to the public. \nIf you are a backer at the Fellforged tier or above, you should have gotten your link to the PDF from DriveThru or RPGNow today.

You guys are really fantastic!\nCOMPLETED GOALS\n\nStretch Goal Zero\u2014Outstation Lima: The game will include more sketches by Brennen Reece!\n\nStretch Goal One\u2014Perimeter Tower #6: The game will include a new two-page color illustration by Jesse Parrotti, and we've added a new reward level to allow for even more art!\n\nStretch Goal Two\u2014Mycoculture Dome: We'll be releasing a short story set in the Durance universe, written by Jason Morningstar and edited by the legendary Will Hindmarch!\nStretch Goal Three\u2014Oxygen Plant: We'll be releasing a digital supplement to all backers featuring a set of ready-to-play settings (a planet and colony pair) written by ourselves and a handful of fantastic guest authors!\nDurance is Jason Morningstar\u2019s unique take on life in a far-future penal colony. The game is a fast-paced, low-prep, highly collaborative tabletop game in the tradition of Fiasco.\nDurance is designed for 3-5 players and can be played over one or more sessions with very little preparation required. Players assume the dual roles of Authority and convict colonists trying to survive on an outrageously hostile planet. The thin veneer that separates the two classes tends to erode during play, raising questions about corruption, justice and mercy.\nOne cool thing about Durance is that, like Fiasco, you generate the setting and characters as part of play. This step takes half an hour and results in an exciting, unstable collection of characters mired in a grim and equally unstable setting you helped to devise.What will your colony be like? What dismal horrors does the planet it is carved out of have in store? And, most importantly, who are the people who are marooned there? \nThe hierarchy of status and position, called the Ladder, is central to the game. Players will author and control two characters (\"colony notables\"), each one from a different class and station. \nGameplay is fast and loose. You'll take turns in the role of Guide, asking questions about the cast of miscreants and ne'er-do-wells you've created and seeing them answered by your friends around the table. Those answers are always flavored by savagery or servility or some drive unique to your colony, like harmony or control. In the end, your friends will always surprise you.\nDurance is a fun game, deeply rooted in the dystopic far future setting you build. It's full of real human drama mixed with brutal action and thought-provoking moral dilemmas.\n\nDurance was designed and edited by Jason Morningstar and Steve Segedy respectively. Together, we are Bully Pulpit Games, and we've been creating and publishing games such as the Shab-al-Hiri Roach, Grey Ranks, and Fiasco since 2006. \nJesse Parrotti created a beautiful full-color cover image that captures the feel of the game perfectly.\nBrennen Reece did all the interior sketch art, each drawing a portrait of one of the colony Notables, as if the work was torn from the sketchbook of an artist in the colony.\nFred Hicks of Evil Hat is doing the layout for the book, and it's fantastic. You might know Fred as the multiple Origins award winner and graphic designer behind such visually striking titles as Don\u2019t Rest Your Head and the Dresden Files RPG. \nOur goal is set relatively low for the project because we already have a solid track record for putting together funding and publishing games. We need your support for Durance because we want you to be involved in the process from the beginning, helping us to shape the sci-fi vision for the game. Our experience with Fiasco taught us that getting smart, enthusiastic people involved makes the game better, and so that's exactly what we hope to do with Kickstarter.\nIf we meet our initial goal, your contributions will be helping us print the game in full color and pay our artists for their excellent work. If we exceed our goal, we'll use the additional funds to secure more artwork for the game, add enhanced features to the PDF, and possibly create supplementary content for the game. More details on all of this will be available as we go forward.\nWhen completed, the game will be available as a full-color, 6x9 perfect-bound book and PDF, with roughly 130 pages of rules, examples, and excellent artwork.\nEXCLUSIVE ACCESS!\nEvery contributor will get early access to the unfinished PDF, and we hope that you'll give us your feedback. The game is very tight and the rules are complete, but it's always helpful to have extra eyes to help make sure the text is clear. With your help, we're hoping to eliminate any potential errata before we ever go to print!\nHARDBACK EDITION!\nas an exclusive for this Kickstarter project, the book will also be available as a signed, limited-edition hardcover version.\nSURVEYOR CARDS!\nThis high quality deck of cards includes all of the colonies and planets, as well as the planet/colony survey assessments, putting everything you need in easy reach. The deck is a set of poker-sized, full-color cards with rounded corners and a glossy finish, making it an attractive addition to your tabletop game.\nA prototype design for the Surveyor Cards\nCREATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS!\nThis is the part we're really excited about! Everyone who backs the project at $75 or above will have the opportunity to help us define the details and color for the twenty planets and twenty colonies in the game. Everyone has their own vision when it comes to science fiction, and this gives us the chance to collaborate to create the best setting material for Durance right from the start.\nIf you choose a reward level that involves creative contributions, we will contact you as soon as you pledge with details on how to submit your content. We'll need your submissions no later than July 1st. If your submission does not reach us in time we\u2019ll write one for you and it will be awesome.\nYour contribution needs to be in English or Authority Uniglot, in the format and length we indicate when we contact you. We reserve the right to edit your entry however we feel necessary or reject it entirely for any reason. We will absolutely do this if it doesn\u2019t fit the tone of the game or the criteria we provide.\nYou grant us a permanent and non-revocable but non-exclusive license to use your contributions in BPG products. This means we can use them in Durance and other work, with credit to you, but you can also do whatever you like with them.\nAll Durance backers will have their name included in the book, categorized by their position on the Ladder according to their chosen reward level. The highest level backers will choose from a limited set of unique titles from the Ladder (\"The Governor\" for example) on a first-come-first-choice basis.\nThank you for reading about our project, and for considering backing Durance! We're very excited about the game, and we hope that you will be too.\nThanks also to all of our playtesters and friends who've given us feedback and ideas to help make the game the best it can be.

(and about that harassment stuff)\nAbout this Project:\nI love playing video games but I\u2019m regularly disappointed in the limited and limiting ways women are represented.  This video project will explore, analyze and deconstruct some of the most common tropes and stereotypes of female characters in games.  The series will highlight the larger recurring patterns and conventions used within the gaming industry rather than just focusing on the worst offenders.  I\u2019m going to need your help to make it happen!\nAs a gamer, a pop culture critic and a fan, I\u2019m always working to balance my enjoyment of media while simultaneously being critical of problematic gender representations. With my video web series Feminist Frequency,  I look at the way women are portrayed in mass media and the impact they have on our culture and society.\nTHE PROJECT\nWith your help, I\u2019ll produce a 5-video series (now expanded to 12 videos) entitled Tropes vs Women in Video Games, exploring female character stereotypes throughout the history of the gaming industry.  This ambitious project will primarily focus on these reoccurring tropes: \nDamsel in Distress - Video #1\nThe Fighting F#@k Toy - Video #2\nThe Sexy Sidekick - Video #3\nThe Sexy Villainess - Video #4\nBackground Decoration - Video #5\n1st Set of Stretch Goals Achieved!\nVoodoo Priestess/Tribal Sorceress - Video #6\nWomen as Reward - Video #7\nMrs. Male Character - Video #8\nUnattractive Equals Evil - Video #9\nMan with Boobs - Video #10\nPositive Female Characters! - Video #11\n2nd Stretch Goal Achieved! \nLet's Bump up the Production Quality!\n3rd Set of Stretch Goals Achieved!\nTropes vs Women in Video Games Classroom Curriculum \nVideo #12 - Top 10 Most Common Defenses of Sexism in Games\nEach video will be between 10 and 20 minutes long and available online for free for everyone and anyone to watch, share and use.\nCreating these videos take a lot of time and money to produce. I will be researching and playing hundreds of titles from across the gaming industry (including some truly awful games that I wouldn\u2019t wish upon anyone!). Your support will go towards production costs, equipment, games and downloadable content.\nPlease pledge any amount you can and become a backer of Feminist Frequency\u2019s Tropes vs Women in Video Games!\nFeminist Frequency is an ongoing web series of video commentaries focusing on representations of gender, race, class, sexuality and ability in pop culture. \nLast year I released a video series called Tropes vs Women analyzing female representations in the mainstream media.  This previous series was highly successful and shared all over the web.  Not only did it provide people the language to understand the media they were engaging with, but it's even served as a guide for some professional writers and media creators to actively avoid gendered character stereotypes and create more in-depth, and more engaging female characters.  \nHelp me create another successful video series that will contribute to and help amplify the existing conversations happening about female characters in games and maybe even get the attention of the gaming industry to start creating more interesting, engaging and complex female characters, that avoid the standard boring cliches.\nVisit FeministFrequency.com to see examples of my previous video work.\nKickstarter doesn't have subtitle integration with their videos so I've posted a full transcript of the video here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #43", "update_userinfo": "Free Classroom Curriculum is here!", "update_content": "Hi everyone!\nWe are thrilled to announce that an outstanding curriculum supporting the Tropes vs. Women in Video Games series is now available!

Having only played one of the older Tomb Raider games back in the day, and none of the Uncharted series, I don't know much of the history we're discussing here. I do think that the complaints you're seeing are probably coming for three different reasons, despite the similarity you rightly point out between the two game series and why Tomb Raider might seek to emulate Uncharted. First: Players who stick with a game series even when it doesn't change are often fond of the formula as-is. I remember Tomb Raider being the kind of game where Lara was generally a wisecracking badass, more directly comparable to Indiana Jones than anyone else. Like Indiana Jones, she was completely in control, but it seemed that inevitably, one of her helpful contacts would betray her in the middle of the adventure, causing an annoying setback. If this formula may be lost in the new game, which seems to take on a more serious tone, the old fans who liked things as they were might be disappointed, feeling that something is being fixed that wasn't broken. Second: I've watched a youtube video showing the demo and the trailer, and in one spot of the demo when the guy grabs Lara's leg, she shrieks in rising terror and eventually kicks him off. I think the way in which this was portrayed may feel to many like the threat that Lara can get raped is being introduced at all, even though she gets herself out of the situation. So the complaint might just be that if it was Nathan, he wouldn't be wriggling and shrieking in the same way because he'd be portrayed as responding to the same assault differently. This could be the characters being different, but we're agreed that Lara Croft and Nathan of Uncharted are really similar in personality, so why should she act differently (frightened and shrieking) than he would in this situation? It's suspicious. Third: I also think people might be concerned since this is the first Tomb Raider game published since Eidos was acquired by Square-Enix (though there was a game lacking the name Tomb Raider according to the timeline I've found on Wikipedia). Square-Enix's handling of the character is bound to be a little different than previous games', and the creative team on the project may be totally different. That's a legitimate concern for the character being treated in a different way, and could lead people to worry about how it will turn out based on what little they've seen so far.", "time": "about 9 years ago"}, {"username": "Rebecca Richards", "content": "Please continue your great work.

Final Fantasy X-2 is seen as more of a comedic diversion and fanservice to those who didn't want Final Fantasy X to end. And while that is okay, female characters deserve better than that. Final Fantasy over the years hasn't done much to do that. I would also say, yeah, that's the problem with Final Fantasy VI, Terra wasn't made clearly a female protagonist.

We're so close to the end, now. Opening the door, our eyes are flooded with light before we hear the menacing laugh of a familiar voice. \"You won't get away that easy, puny adventurers!\" he chortles, brandishing a wicked axe. The Druid gasps in terror at the sight of her fallen foe\u2014The Barbarian has returned!\nWe can get out of this dungeon alive if we can muster $75,000 we'll be able to best the Barbarian. Having earned his respect in one last battle, he'll join our party for the long trip back to civilization. We'll release the Barbarian once all the Kickstarter rewards have been fulfilled as an exclusive backer-only PDF supplement sometime before the close of 2012. Gird yourselves, friends\u2014the end is in sight!\nCompleted Goals\nGoal #-2: Dungeon World will also be available as an epub and a set of HTML files.\nGoal #-1: All backers who chose a hardcover copy also receive a PDF of Josh Mannon's Dungeon World adventure Within the Devil's Reach.\nGoal #0: We'll be producing an online monster creator that lets you save and share your favorite creations.\nGoal #1\u2014The Portal: Every backer will receive a PDF of Dark Heart of the Dreamer, a planar adventure by Jonathan Walton.\nGoal #2\u2014The Archives: Every backer will receive a PDF of World of Dungeons, a complete short game in a classic style inspired by Dungeon World and written by John Harper.\nGoal #3\u2014The Arena: We'll be producing The Druid as a Dungeon World class!\nGoal #4\u2014The Illusionist: All backers pledging $25 or more will receive special print versions of the Backers Only Compendium Class Supplement and Backers Only Monster Supplement.\nGoal #5\u2014The Goblin Warrens: All backers will receive Justin Wightbred's Number Appearing supplement as a free PDF.\nGoal #6\u2014The Respite: All backers pledging $25 or more will receive Jonathan Walton's Dark Heart of the Dreamer in print.\nGoal #7\u2014The Armory: All backers will receive a PDF off the first Dungeon World event supplement which brings war to your Dungeon World.\nGoal #8\u2014The Ice Demon: All backers will receive a PDF of Juntu's Floating Ice Hell, a Dungeon World adventure by Jason Morningstar.\nGoal #9\u2014The Color Spray: We'll be producing a color version of the Dungeon World PDF for all backers.\nAn Update On Town Merchant and Merchant Prince Backer Rewards\nWe've been crunching some numbers on retail and we're happy to announce that Town Merchant and Merchant Prince backers will receive 5 copies instead of 4. This should make having Dungeon World at your local shop a much easier option. (We'd love to update the reward descriptions, but since some people have already chosen them we can't!)\nWhat Is Dungeon World?\nDungeon World is a fantasy roleplaying game about exploring dungeons, fighting monsters and looting treasure. In Dungeon World you and your friends take up the role of classic character classes and undertake exciting adventures together. Through your triumphs and travails the world changes around you.\nThe Dungeon World rules are simple and elegant. They exist to help you create unpredictable adventures and fluid action - to move from battles to exploration to moments of magic and mystery with ease. Dungeon World's rules all tell you when to use them: every rule comes into effect just when it's needed and stays out of the way the rest of the time.\nDungeon World emerged from our love of two things\u2014modern game design and old-school RPG action.  We wanted to create a game with the wide-eyed excitement and wonder of your first time playing a fantasy RPG and rules that draw on a long history of innovation and creativity. The best of both worlds!\nThe text of the game is complete and we're working with an editor to polish and perfect it right now. The text of Dungeon World is available under a creative commons license and will remain that way whether we meet our Kickstarter goal or not (we wanted to make sure that everyone got a chance to play Dungeon World).  \nIf the game is done and the rules are ready to go, what do we need your help with? We want to make Dungeon World the best game it can be, and to do that, we need your support. We'll offer the game to our contributors as a fully-featured PDF (with art, professional layout, hyperlinks and indexing) and, if you contribute at any level above the first, a softcover or hardcover version of the rules. As well, we've got a whole bunch of fun rewards at various tiers including t-shirts, pins, custom dice, and one-of-a-kind art from our artists.\nCommunity\nDungeon World was developed out in the open\u2014documentation and feedback has always been a huge priority for us. You can see the open development taking place here at our GitHub site. As a result of this model we've had over 250 playtesters over the two years that DW has been in development! Hundreds and hundreds of hours of gameplay have gone into the game. Here's a few nice things our players had to say\u2026\n\"Dungeon World is a slice of fried gold and I adore it!\"\n- Jason Morningstar, Designer: Fiasco\n\"Dungeon World is my go to game for a quick to setup one-shot fantasy adventure. Every game I've played of Dungeon World invokes the feeling of exploration, danger, and wonder that I had when I first started playing RPGs.\"\n- Jeremy Friesen, Adventurer's Guild Member\n\"Dungeon World is fun and innovative take on the oldest kind of roleplaying experiences. It's a wonderful blend of old and new that should make practically any gamer happy.\" \n- Monte Cook, Co-Designer: Dungeons & Dragons (3rd Edition)\nEvery contributor will receive a copy of the game in PDF form, with all the bells and whistles. Additionally, we'll be providing PDF copies of two Kickstarter-only supplements: one filled with exciting new monsters and the other with compendium classes (special themed mini-classes you can use in your Dungeon World game). All contributor levels also include special DW wallpaper for your PC, Mac, or mobile device. Your name will appear in the Thanks chapter as a backer.\nLevels including the softcover version of the rules will receive a printed copy of the game rulebook. We're big fans of games as physical artifacts\u2014you can be sure we'll provide the best quality book we can put in your hands.\nContributors who choose a level including the hardcover reward will receive a limited edition premium signed copy of the game rules in hardcover. We're only planning one run of hardcovers, so get one while you can.\nIn Dungeon World, \"Bonds\" are what tie the characters together, forming their shared history and giving them relationships to build on even before play starts. A Bond might say \"Avon has trusted me with a secret.\" Contributors who choose a level including this reward will get to work with us to write their own Bonds with Dungeon World, to be included in the PDF and printed books.\nThis reward replaces \"Thanks\" and is included free-of-charge in all reward levels where it appears.\nBreak out the soda and clear off the old ping-pong table. This package is a trip back to the basement that includes two custom Dungeon World dice and a Dungeon World notebook and pen set for keeping track of who owes you gold pieces and where you hid that magic ring.\nLet all the other kids at DW High know how you roll with this backpack customization kit. Including a full set of eight Dungeon World Glyph pins and a special Kickstarter-only Dungeon World sew-on patch. You will be the coolest kid within 3d6 x 10\". \nAny contributor whose reward includes this level will receive a Dungeon World logo t-shirt in classic white-on-black style.\nIt may not give you an armor bonus, but you'll always take +1 forward to impress. We promise.\nThis reward entitles the contributor to work with us to design a \"Compendium Class\" for inclusion in the Backer Supplement. You give us a theme and we'll design some moves for you and distribute them to the whole DW Backer group when the game is released.\nHave a favorite beast, creature or abomination you want to see in Dungeon World? Contribute at a level including this reward and we'll work with you to create and stat out a monster (with description, statistics, and special moves) that will be included in the Backer Supplement once the game is released.\nLove the Bard? Admire the Ranger? Want to create a signature character of your own? With this contribution reward, you'll work with our character artist, Emily DeLisle to create a full-color digital portrait of a character of your own design in the style you see on the class pages in Dungeon World. You'll receive high-resolution print-ready images as well as custom character sheets with your character in them.\nWith this reward, you'll work with famed dungeon cartographer Tony Dowler to create a special dungeon map for use in your next Dungeon World game. We'll also create a Front to use with your map so that you can just throw it in to your game. You'll receive a high-quality print-ready image as well as a PDF presenting your dungeon along with the Front that festers inside it.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #59", "update_userinfo": "Inglorious Is Text and Layout Complete!", "update_content": "We're back from our latest dungeon delve, and found a village craftsman to pretty things up a bit.

I suppose you could think numerically as well: Healthy+5,+4,+3,+2,+1, 0 (Dead),-1,-2,-3,-4,(-5 undead). Just like there is a force keeping us alive there is also a force keeping the undead functioning. Lets say you cast a healing spell at a zombie. It hits him and the spell completes it's primary function and heals its target, Now the undead goes from (-5 undead) to -4 or -3 bringing him closer to 0 which would be death.

Or maybe it's D&D's missing game board. \nThis blogofholding.com Kickstarter ends right before Wizards of the Coast re-releases the First Edition rulebooks, so you should get your new 1e rulebooks and this 1e game poster on around the same day.\nAlong with my last poster, the OD&D Illustrated Wandering Monster Poster, this poster is all you need to generate infinite random dungeon adventures for solo or group play.\nWith three days left, we've hit tons of bonus goals and more are in reach! Here's a list of what extras you'll get for every pledge level. \n$5 backers: $5 backers started with a PDF of the poster. As bonus rewards, they're now getting:\nA PDF copy of a D&D-compatible board game, Dungeon Robber, which uses the poster as a board. It's now got rules for statting up YOURSELF as a Dungeon Robber: did you get straight As? Intelligence bonus! Can you bench your weight (or 150% your weight for men)? Strength bonus! (Note: as a $17 backer, you'll have the option to get a print copy.)\nAccess to an interactive, online version of the poster: like the poster, you can use it to generate random dungeons. It'll move you around the dungeon and roll the dice for you. This will be exclusive to backers for a few months, then I'll make it a free web app.\n$17+ backers: $17 backers started with a Random Dungeon poster and a PDF of the poster. As bonus rewards, they get:\nEVERY BONUS REWARD THAT $5+ BACKERS GET (Dungeon Robber, online poster)\nA giant PDF containing a) dungeon adventures by master DMs Mike Mornard, Mike Shea and Tracy Hurley; b) Adventurer Conqueror King (ACKS) rules for the dungeon by Tavis Allison; c) Dungeon Robber game rules. All told, this should be a pretty hefty PDF: since it will also be useful at the game table, I'll make it available for backers only as a super-cheap lulu book for $5.\n$22+ backers: Besides whatever else they get for their pledge levels (a signed poster, etc), all $22+ backers get a PDF of the poster. As bonus rewards, they get:\nEVERY BONUS REWARD THAT $5+ BACKERS GET (Dungeon Robber, online poster)\nEVERY BONUS REWARD THAT $17+ BACKERS GET (all-star dungeon adventures and ACKS rules, pdf and lulu)\na signed bonus poster: either a second Random Dungeon poster or a Wandering Monsters poster.\nA sheet of 20 stickers inspired by the poster, by a dozen artists.\nA PDF copy of Paul's DM Notebook, an all-editions D&D resource, containing art, adventures, DM advice, rules, and settings, that will be 75-100 pages. It's too big to send in poster tubes, but I'll make a print version available on Lulu for $5 for backers only. To save shipping, I'll also make a single print book that contains the DM notebook and the various-authors lulubook in one volume.\nIf we reach $22k: a PDF of five watercolor dungeon-adventure paintings by Jared von Hindman. If possible, I would love to make these available as prints as well!\nIf we reach $23k: Custom tokens from the D&D Virtual Table!\nHigher backers: Every bonus reward for the $5+, $17+, and $22+ tiers!\nBonus reward for posterity: I've agreed to donate my original artwork to Tim Hutchinson, the curator of D&D history, for PlaGMaDA.\nShipping: If you live outside of North America, and you're getting a poster in the mail, please add $5 to your pledge for international shipping. That's true for every pledge level from $17 up: so, for instance, if you want the $22 reward, please pledge $27. If you don't, I'll nag you about it when the project closes.\nUSA, Canada, and Mexico don't require extra shipping.\nDelivery Dates:\nI'll do my best to have mailed stuff (posters and stickers) arrive in April. I'm on the pace, as long as no shipping/printing roadblocks develop.\nMost PDFs will be available in April as well, probably around the same time as the posters are mailed. The Paul's DM Notebook lulubook will also be available in April.\nThe all-star dungeon adventures PDF and lulubook will be ready later: it's scheduled for May, but it depends on the availability of the authors.\nThe online dungeon crawler should be ready in May or June or so. One thing I've learned as a programmer is not to guarantee software delivery dates.\nOne more thing...\nThere is a secret bonus goal if we reach 2 Burlew Points ($25,082)!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "dungeon robber 1.2: savegames that save! relocate your robber!

Everybody gets that content now.\nAlso, if you know of a student/youth group that is made of win and would like to have me come out and run the game for them, let me know. If we hit $6,000, I will pick from among the groups suggested to me, and I will give them a game experience they will hopefully never forget. Thanks for your understanding with all of this.\n(3/22/12) Lowered Goal!\nYou might have missed the update I posted, but the stretch goal for the Trowbridge Student Guide has been lowered!\nNew Goal: $6,000\nIf we get a big push here at the end, we could make it!\n(3/22/12) Kicking It Forward\n\"We solemnly pledge 5% of the profits from the finished product back to the Kickstarter community to help fund other people's dreams.\" \nYou all have helped me realize this dream. How could I not help others do the same?\n(3/11/12) Current Unlockable: Trowbridge High Student Guide!\nWe've unlocked the first stretch goal (see below), and now we're cruising toward the second one: the Trowbridge High Student Guide. As School Daze plays, the setting is supposed to be very vague; it becomes what the players and Administrator want it to be. However, if we hit 7k, then I'll be writing another book with a fully detailed description of one version of Trowbridge, complete with NPCs and plot hooks. \nBut, that's not all!\nThe Student Guide will also include 5-6 alternate genre settings for School Daze. High school in space? Oh, yeah? In the Wild West? Done. Medieval high school? We've got that covered, too. But, that books only gets written if we get to 7k. So let's do this thing!\n(3/8/12) First stretch goal unlocked! Dice and Dice bags.\nNow, every tier of $50 and up gets four custom School Daze d6s, and every tier of $75 and up gets a custom dice bag from Dragon Chow!\nNow, on to the actual project!\nSchool Daze\nIf you like narrative-driven roleplaying games with light systems, and easy character creation, you'll love School Daze. It's gaming, in a high school setting, and it rocks.\nHigh school is a time that everyone remembers. We see it everywhere: in movies, and books, and music. But what we see there isn't real high school, and neither is School Daze. School Daze uses high school as a vehicle to tell fun stories. Stories like you'd see in Saved by the Bell, Buffy, the Vampire Slayer, The Breakfast Club, or Brick. School Daze is high school, but it's high school the way you want it.\nSchool Daze is designed for groups of 3-6 people, but could be played with as few as two, or as many as you might be crazy enough to get together. One person acts as the Administrator, facilitating the action, and making sure that everyone gets time in the spotlight. Group Projects provide a loose framework within which the group can tell their own characters' stories. Each player is empowered to add to not only the narrative, but the setting. Trowbridge High is left with little description on purpose: make up NPCs, plot devices, and make it your own!\nIf you want to hear what a game session sounds like, you can check out the audio of three of my playtests (NSFW language and some content):\nPlaytest 1\nPlaytest 2\nPlaytest 3 - Vulgar Halloween\nWhere Will the Money Go?\nSince this is my first roleplaying game, I wanted to make sure that I'm making everything as spectacular as I can. To that end, if this project gets funded, School Daze will have the following people working on it:\nLayout - Daniel Solis, author of Happy Birthday, Robot!, Do: Pilgrims of the Flying Temple, and all-around amazing person. (danielsolisblog.blogspot.com)\nArt - Brian Patterson, author and artist in charge of the webcomic d20 Monkey, and designer of awesome gaming-related t-shirts. (d20monkey.com)\nEditing - Liz Bauman, social media guru, copywriter par excellance, and purveyor of good taste. Also known as d20 Blonde.\nI want to make sure that I handle the business side of things properly. I'm going to be starting a company for my work, called Sand & Steam Productions, buying software to support my work, looking at a re-design of my website, logo, and business cards, and paying for the set-up for the printing of the physical copies of School Daze. The funds from this Kickstarter will help me do those things. If we exceed the funding goal, I've got some super-sweet stretch goals planned.\nI believe in openness. School Daze has been publicly developed from the start. And, every step of the way, it has been available under a Creative Commons license. That will remain true if this project is funded. Everything, from the text to the layout, to the art, will be available for you to remix, and reuse, as long as you attribute the original work. I could not have done this without the fantastic community of gamers that surrounds me, and I hope that others will benefit from School Daze in the same way that I've benefited from other people in the industry.\nIf all of this sounds good to you, I encourage you to back this project. I'm very proud of my work on School Daze, and this Kickstarter will help me see it produced the way it deserves to be produced. Thank you for support. It means the world to me. \nFor more information about School Daze, and Sand & Steam Productions, please check out my website: http://www.sandandsteam.net/schooldaze", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #32", "update_userinfo": "Products and Shipping", "update_content": "A quick update, dealing with two things.\nFirst\nBacker rewards are almost all shipped!
