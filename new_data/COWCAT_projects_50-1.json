[{"backer": "COWCAT", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": " Website Twitter YouTube\nWe love adventure games! And for the past six months, we have been working nights and weekends, to create an adventure of our own. You can see some of the results in the trailer above, or in the extended version down below. This has been an exiting journey so far, but we have realised that the amount of work that goes into making a game is unmanageable with our current work schedules. So\u2026 We turn to kickstarter for help! \nWe would love to deliver this game, and think that there might be enough people out there who would like to see this game finished. We want to create an old-school feeling, 2d point and click adventure to all fans of the genre. We draw most of our inspiration from classic noir and cyberpunk movies as well as from the point and click adventure games of the 80/90s. With this game, we aim to create a tense, funny and atmospheric adventure, with a lot of twists and turns, vast character cabinet and a focus on telling an engaging story whilst letting the player solve intricate puzzles.\nPictures speak more than a thousand words, if you want to get an even better feel for the game, scroll down to the extended trailer!\nWe are hoping to release the game in the second half of 2022. Help us bring Invasive Recall to life!\n\nIn a not-so-distant future, advances in neurological science and artificial intelligence gives birth to a new technology by which it is possible to scan and interpret thoughts of the human mind. The procedure is soon discovered to wreak havoc on the minds of test subjects, rendering them severely demented or insane. Clinical trials are quickly ended, and the technology is put on hold until legislators permit law enforcement to use it on recently deceased victims of crime. By retrieving their last fading memories, detectives can find details vital to a case, often realising the identity of the perpetrator right at the crime scene. The process, dubbed \u201cInvasive Recall\u201d, is adopted by specially trained units who\u2019s detectives go by the nickname \u201cMind Readers\u201d.\n\nRecall detectives John Landon and Rachel Hapley only know each other by reputation. Landon is a rookie detective for the city police; Rachel is working for a tech savvy, well funded privatized organization. Landon is investigating the murder of a prominent scientists while Rachel is working on a set of mysterious disappearances. Little do they know that their paths are about to cross, and that they soon will face a vastly more sinister truth than the everyday crime and corruption of the city.\n Classic 2d point and click adventure: We grew up with the point and click genre, and we think that it has time and again proven itself as a great vehicle for telling intriguing stories. We are not aiming to reinvent the wheel, we just want to take what was good of the classic games like maniac mansion, monkey island, fullthrottle and broken sword and make a traditional and well crafted game. \nLandon and his mentor Grimes entering a crime scene.\n Character switching: Switch between Rachel and Landon at will. Character switching is great for adding variety to both story and puzzles. It gives an alternative approach for the player if stuck and also opens up to interesting puzzles where character collaboration is the only solution.\nRachel and Landon reluctantly team up.\n Invasive Recall Mechanic: Utilize your Recall instrument to transfer memories of the recently deceased and play through their last moments alive. Uncover clues in the past that help you solve puzzles in the present.\nThe recall procedure is invaluable when it comes to gathering clues and moving the investigation forward.\n Vast city to explore: As you discover new places to explore you can move freely between the scenes of the city thanks to police responders used by both Landon and Rachel. \nTravel the city by selecting your destination on your responders on-board computer.\n Puzzles that enhance and move the story forward, without obstructing it: Our goal is to make the puzzles feel like a natural part of the world of the game, and never feel like something shoehorned in for the sake of adding friction. having said that, we do love puzzles and the game will have lots of them!\nThe coroner and the morgue is important assets when it comes to gathering information regarding the more morbid sides of the investigations.\n 9 verb interface: Using the classic nine verb interface is in line with our approach to puzzle design. We want the player to think their way through our game, and we find this type of interface really engages the player and allows for more creative puzzles.\nLandon is investigating someones bathroom.\n A dark and rainy mystery of epic proportions: Find out what is stirring beneath the surface of the city. Why are a handful of prominent scientist turning up dead? Why are ordinary people vanishing into thin air, never to be seen again?\nThe city holds many secrets.\n Lots of locations: We don't want to give to much away, but here are a few of the locations we have been working on...\nThe police station is a big part of the game. It houses the detective offices, interrogation rooms, a jail, and a morgue.\nThe path takes our detectives through the city's slums as well as some more high end establishments. Here they are at Kobayashi Tower.\nRachel is doing some investigating.\nNot all events follow the main theme of the game. Here Landon has to find out what has driven his collegue Randy to escape into Virtual Reality. He's been using the office headset for days! Will Landon be able to get through to him before it's to late?\n\n Lots of animations: The game will have lots of animations, here is a sample from some of the animations for the main characters:\n The Game: Digital copy of the game on the platform of your choice: Pc, Mac, Linux, IOS, Android, Steam or GOG, DRM-Free.\n\n Digital Art Booklet: Includes promo art, background art, character art and \"Making of\" section with tutorials on character animation and backgrounds.\n\n Digital Soundtrack: Full digital soundtrack containing everything from smooth ballads to thrilling suspense music, all with an 80's electronic vibe.\n\n Criminal Record: Your own entry in the in-game searchable police database. Let players look you up, for a laugh or an interesting story. Provide a text and a picture (picture is optional and will be converted to pixel graphics) describing your escapades as a wanted criminal, or an innocent victim of circumstance, it's up to you. (text and picture is subject to our approval)\n\n Beta Tester: Get acces to demo builds. We believe that there is great value in getting feedback from the community. To make this an as polished experience as possible we will send out several demo builds of scenes being worked on and provide ways for you to give direct feedback to us. Help us make Invasive Recall an even greater experience!\n\n Producer: Get credited as producer. You will recieve exclusive updates and our heartfelt thanks for being a major factor in realizing this project!\n\n Executive Producer: Get credited as executive producer! Recieve exclusive updates and giant, warm thanks from the creators of this project! You are a very big part in making this project a reality!\n\n Become an NPC: This is also a big one, and will require some effort on your part! Create your own character, either as yourself or let you imagination run wild! \nYou decide how your character should look and behave as well as provide an interesting backstory.\nWe are a small indie team from Gothenburg, Sweden with a shared interest for all things retro. We spend our free time dreaming about games, movies and music.\n\nCarl: Software developer during the day; Game designer, illustrator, animator at night.\nLove: Craftsman and multiartist; Composer and sound designer on Invasive Recall.\nOscar: Day job as a software engineer; Game developer and game designer at night.\nThe game is at this time at about 20% completion. At the rate we are progressing, since all of us have full-time jobs, it will take a long time to complete the project. The money we gather through Kickstarter will make it so that at least one of us can be a full-time developer on this going forward and also increase the time spent on the project by all team members. If we succeed, we think we need 12-16 months to complete the game. We aim to handle the development entirely within our team.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are aware that making a video game is no easy feat.

Having spent the last 6 months working on different parts of the game, we have solved a lot of problems and found a way of working that we feel truly comfortable with. Having said that, unforeseen challenges may always arise, but we are intent on tackling them head on. \nWe also feel that community feedback is an important part of making a polished game and are hoping to get backer feedback from the tester reward tier.\nWe aim to prioritize the quality of the game over delivering on a set date.

When we launched 4 weeks ago, we had 5 followers on our pre-launch page, and those were the only ones who knew the project even existed. It's safe to say that we were off to a slow start. During the campaign we have had a few spikes and things have periodically looked quite promising. But overall, we lacked a bit of momentum, at least enough to reach the goal with the reward/pricing strategy we had lined up. Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t make it all the way.

When we launched the campaign 4 weeks ago, only three people actually knew the project existed, and it was in hindsight way to hastily to launch with such low level of awareness for it.

With Aveliana I want to bring novelty to indie games with fun and original gameplay! Aveliana is an infiltration-action-adventure game!\nJUMP INTO THE ADVENTURE AND PLAY THE DEMO ON Gamejolt!. \nAveliana is a 2.5D game with unique gameplay: based on the detection pattern of enemies, you find your own route through the world. All the enemies can be avoided in the idea of a commandos-like. The gameplay is ultra-dynamic because it is focused on a single character, Aveliana. \n(This trailer was selected as \"best indie game trailer\" by Best Indie Games!)  \nIf you feel one path is too complicated or you want to explore a new route, it is always possible to find a secret path, in which the game smoothly transition from 2.5D to a 2D platformer. And if you are tremendous, you can choose to stand and fight your enemies!\nThe gameplay is constantly renewed in Aveliana thanks to the many enemies that I have crafted for you. Each of them has a different detection and attack pattern. Tall enemies, like robots, can not be directly targeted because they are too tall. However, Aveliana has other tricks in her bag. All along with the game, you will also unlock new abilities to build your character. \n Don't you love hiding in high-grass?\nPLAY\n\nAveliana is also a game with beautiful environments that you will want to explore to discover all the secrets of the game (and you can contribute to it in some rewards!). Each level has a different environment and atmosphere. Sometimes, after an action-packed sequence, you will have the joy to admire the landscape before continuing the adventure! After a long journey in an environment entirely hand-drawn, you will face fierce and unique bosses!\n2.5D / isometric view environments:\n2D environments:\n Note: you don't like too difficult games and you just want to know Aveliana's story and discover the levels? No worries, there will be a \"story mode\" for you! \nThe game will be initially released on Steam and will support Windows, Linux and Mac. Later it could be ported to consoles.\nElevator pitch\nAveliana is an action-infiltration-adventure game recognizable by its art design as well as for its fun and unique gameplay!\nEmbrace Aveliana\u2019s quest to bring back someone she has lost! The game takes place alternatively in an isometric or a 2D point of view and is fast-paced. Guide her through arduous paths watched by monsters, follow the trace of a mysterious fox, and find the powerful artifacts she is looking for at the core of wonderful temples. Will you stealth your way to victory? Seek a forgotten path on the edge of a cliff? Or stand and fight against your enemies? The choice is yours!\n PRESS KIT\nWhat are my inspirations?\nJust before starting the game development, I was playing a series of games that probably initiated the thought process in my mind. I played Zelda Breath of the wild, Celeste, Cuphead, Disco Elysium, and finally Children of Morta. I am also inspired by other games such as Gris, Commandos, Rayman origins, and of course Zelda Ocarina of time! Other arts also inspire me, such as painting or music, but also poetry, and anime (in particular Miyasaki's work that I find unique and so poetic!).\nWhat makes Aveliana unique?\nThe gameplay, the story, and the art style!\n2.5D to 2D smooth transition! You can find hidden 2D passages but if you fall, you may fall onto enemies:\nPLAY\n\nUnique and diverse stealth gameplay\nPrecise and fast gameplay for experts (speedrunners!), and adjustable for occasional gamers\nA recognizable artistic design\nHand-drawn environments with a lot of variety\nA meaningful story with a lot of story twists\nChoose your set of skills for the adventure\nIn Aveliana, at the start of each level, you can reassign your abilities and adapt the set of skills to the upcoming level and to your playstyle. For instance, here the first ability I have chosen (which is the one by default in the demo) is the Dash ability because I like to move quickly, but I could have chosen the Hard skin instead to take less damages. For each slot, you will have to choose between two options! \nFoes in Aveliana \nAll enemies in Aveliana have their own detection and attack pattern! The game already has three \"common\" enemies that detect you with a cone (like the yellow guys in the little video below)! Each of them will be of a different type (melee, zone, ranged)!\nHere you can see the new ranged enemy I have just implemented (quite challenging to fight for me):\nPLAY\n\n It also already has 7 unique and more challenging enemies, like the ones below, that will force you to modify your approach and think about your movements! Look at the rewards because you could participate in the development of more enemies like this!\n (this one below you can only see when you are on specific spots where you can activate your medallion)\n(that one makes a circle around you and you have to stay in it!)\nPLAY\n\nAnd finally, we have already three unique bosses in the game! One more is programmed!\nAll this variety in terms of detection and attack patterns is excellent for renewing the gaming experience all along with the game! The enemies can combine in fun and original ways to surprise you at all moments!\nWhat about the story?\nWhile looking for three artifacts, Aveliana will wander a poetic yet dangerous world and discover about her and her environment! As an indie game developer and following my personal thoughts about our world, I wish to use the videogame as a medium to share and carry meaningful messages. As a scientist, what passionate me the most is how a bunch of atoms can come to live, think, eat, love, etc. Aveliana is a strong and reckless bunch of pixels; she is guided by a fox and she starts to understand who she is thanks to him! The whole artistic design, being minimalistic and poetic, has been thought for you to enter into Aveliana\u2019s story and to live a great experience!\n[Work in progress] In-game, if you want to get more details about the story, you can use your medallion and scan around to find hidden little NPCs that will give you the precious information:\nPLAY\n\n Who is Thefrenchdev? \nI'm Romain, a French man from La Rochelle (France). I'm 32 and I have started this project at the end of February 2020 and I literally fell in love with game development. Since then, I have been working on Aveliana every day during my free time (from 6 pm to midnight). It has become my passion and the development has gone so well that I have quickly been able to share playable demos with people. This has motivated me, even more, to continue working on it and make it as fun, interesting, and enjoyable as possible.\n I jumped into game development suddenly but I have a background in programming since I am a theoretical physicist and I have painted and drawn all my life. This has helped me a lot during the whole journey since I haven't had to remove any good idea for the game because of technical limitations.\nI am doing this project solo but I receive a lot of support and help from my wife, Fanny. We did a lot of brainstorming for the story and we often discuss artistic and gameplay ideas!\nThey loved the game! \nThe Escapist has selected the game for The Escapist Game Showcase!\n Gamejolt has selected Aveliana to be featured as an Indie Gem! \"YOU are an indie gem! Really excited to follow along on your progress!\" \nThe game was selected in a video by Best Indie Games!\nAll these awesome guys including IndieGameiacs!\n Why I am doing this Kickstarter? \nBy backing the project, you can really make it outstanding and support a solo indie dev who put all his heart into it! If the game release is successful, maybe I can make my dream come true and become a game developer! \nFirst, for the game development, I want to invest in a new computer because the one I am currently using has neither a great GPU nor CPU. This would help me to be more efficient in game making and game testing (which is an important upcoming phase). For now, it suffers a bit when I need to test the game having other software opened (Unity3D, Photoshop, etc.)!\nOne big reason to kickstart this project is that I would like to raise funds to attend game events and promote the game. I think many beautiful indie games have been forgotten because no one knew they ever existed. Going to such an event costs about 1-2 K$ for the registration fee, the transportation (when we are able to travel again), and a hotel room.\nThen I would like to be able to afford to pay the people who are gratefully contributing to the game. I am specifically thinking about game music. I think the music is so great that the composer deserves more than what she is asking for.\nI bought a few days ago instruments and tools to make and register music (a workstation, a MIDI controller, a sound card, a DAW software, and an amp)! But who will make this music and why? Well, my wife plays the piano very well and I play guitar so we want to make additional music for the game that will be played procedurally. This means, the current music will be used as intro/outro tracks and for special events in the game and the new music will vary depending on what you do! For instance, if you encounter a lot of enemies, the rhythm and instruments in the track will change. I hope this will create a unique atmosphere and I think I have not seen this kind of thing in a game! I am really excited about it and I will use part of the Kickstarter funds for the things I have bought.\n I really want to make a Switch version for the game, and reaching the main goal and then the stretch goal for it would convince me totally to do it! Plus, I have been accepted (in just 3 days!) as a Switch developer (this means they really loved my project)! I will surely dedicate some funds to the port to this console.\nThe Kickstarter goal of 12K will greatly help me with this project! It will also unlock the Kraken (a unique mini-boss that I will design, draw, and implement in the game!).\nThe two stretch goals are important bonuses! The first one is a totally new world and environment for the game that I will draw, design, and implement! This is a mock-up of an environment that I want to create: \nPLAY\n\n The second stretch goal will unlock the voice-over for the English version! I would love so much to have voices for the game story. \nA new and unique reward!\nI have added a new reward called \"The music lover\" which is unique and is a big support for me! \nFor the game, I want to continue working with Ally, who is making awesome tracks, and I want, with my wife, to create new music that will be used during the levels and will be generated procedurally. This means the music will change accordingly to what is happening with smooth transitions. For this, I borrowed some money to pay for a midi keyboard, a sound card and to pay for the 16-tracks version of Bitwig (it is a DAW, a software to create music). All the funds from this reward will be used used to reimburse the instruments and to pay for the upgraded version of Bitwig (I have found some really awesome sounds that can only be used in the \"studio edition\" and tested (but can't be saved) in the \"demo version\"). This is why this reward is unique and matters so much for me: it will contribute to an extremely important piece of the game! If you love music and game music this one is for you! You will have access to all the soundtracks that we will make thanks to your contribution and we can discuss about game music during a discussion.\n(you can make your design)\nBONUS: The music lover is the only one who will be able to add a bonus to his pledge to order a unique Vinyl of Aveliana's soundtracks! The design isn't definitive and because it will be edited only once, you'll be able to choose your image of the game for the cover and the sticker.\nPhysical rewards! (organic/environment-friendly materials)\nI have prepared rewards with a lot of attention and I hope you will love them!\nFirst of all, all ranks have access to a digital version of the game when it will be released!  \n A reward for everyone: If we reach the first Kickstarter goal, I will implement the Kraken into the game! Alongside much other stuff for which you can contribute!\nDiscover the rewards!\nThe design of the tote bag and Aveliana's portrait illustration has been done in collaboration with LesPetitsMo who is an awesome french artist I've discovered during the game development! \nThe other designs are the artworks I have done for the game. The scene with Aveliana and the fox is my absolute favorite, I have spent 10 hours on it! I also love the T-shirt design with Aveliana surrounded by many little details that correspond to the lore of the game (e.g. the fox, the medaillon). If you choose a reward with an illustration please contact me in order to tell me which one you prefer! (non-definitive designs)\nT-shirt (choose your design)\n\nTote bag (design LesPetitsMo)\nPrints (size approx. 21x31 cm)\nContribute to the game creation! \nI have prepared contributive rewards so you can participate in the game making!\nWrite a piece of text that will be added (on my approval) in the game! \nIt can be a side-story, a joke, a quote, a poem, anything you'd like! People will be able to read it in the game and you will be credited in the game! Characters in the game will talk about your legend, or have a laugh when reading your funny joke. I think this is really a unique way of adding your name to the game!\nDesign a new mini-boss or enemy for the game!\nWe will discuss and collaborate to make a new and awesome new monster for the game. Your contribution can be either sketch, drawings, animations, or just ideas of an awesome monster that would make the quest of Aveliana even more arduous!\n\nWhy doing eco-friendly rewards and at what cost? \nI have decided to make the rewards as respectful as possible of the environment because this is something that matters to me! I also wanted to have good fabric for the T-shirt, tote bag, and high-quality paper and printing for the illustrations. For this, I have decided not to increase the reward prices thus it will slightly reduce the margin I will get from physical rewards. For you, it's all beneficial and I hope you will appreciate it!\n Share the news and join us on social media! \nSince I have started the project, about 7 months ago, I have grown a community of more than 8K followers on Instagram, Twitter, and Discord. This has been an exceptional journey with a lot of awesome feedback. I would love it if you'd like to participate in it, follow me, discuss with me, and make the game even greater than it is right now! And you can find news about the game, about the Kickstarter, about Steam release, etc.\nFor the launch of the Kickstarter, I am going to start a fanart challenge! There is nothing to earn and it is all for fun (to thank all the artists that are following me)! The last events I organized received the participation of over a hundred people (#thefrenchdevDTIYS on Instagram)!

However, I have managed to progress a lot already on the game development and there are already many milestones that have been reached (getting a Steam page, making a demo, etc.).\n\nAt which stage am I in the project and what is the plan?\nEven if this is my first game development project, I think I know from the start where I am going and what is the scope of the game. This has helped me to always be on time with my schedule, and even be in advance on many aspects (for instance the IA of the game is already done, the game mechanics and the physics is coded, I have already about 18 levels that are completed and ready for polishing, etc.).\nI have started the game development on the 23rd of February and after about 1 month, I have started to send versions to people on my social media so they could try it and give me feedback. I got a lot of positive feedback and bugs to solve. After 2 months of game development, I have proposed a \"pre-alpha mockup\" on Gamejolt, which has been played more than 250 times! I received a ton of really good feedback and this demo was stable. Then I focused on doing a real demo for the game, the one you can find now on Gamejolt. This version is a glimpse at what will be the game in terms of story, art design, gameplay...\n\nNow for the next 6 months, I want to focus on drawing all the levels of the game (about 25 for about 6-7 hours of estimated gameplay). On the fly, I will of course add new enemies, implement the story, and add features (such as unlocking new abilities for Aveliana). After this, I will enter the final phase of the game development and during the last 6 months, I will focus on polishing everything. Playtest the game a lot and finish the drawings, animations, cutscenes...\n\nI think I can say now that the game will be finished because the project is sufficiently advanced and I see where I am going with it. All the stages have been completed ahead of time until now. \nThe current version of the game is playable and stable, it is just too short and it doesn't carry yet the story I want to tell!

A torrential, purple rain fell on  the puppet's island, destroying the beloved garden and drastically  changing the environment. Strange buildings emerged from nowhere,  species disappeared, being replaced by odd frogs and other creatures.\nIn another world, in another time, the puppet put her gloves on,  determined to find those responsible for this horrible mess. But who  knows where this will lead her...?\n\nDecline's Drops is a beautiful hand-drawn 2D platform-brawler, taking inspiration from the greatest video game classics to create a unique and unforgettable experience. Each world, each character has been meticulously designed and crafted, made with love, passion, and care. Embracing the level design mastery of Yoshi's Island, Kirby's Adventure  or Shovel Knight, Decline's Drops merges it with the satisfying gameplay  of the Super Smash Bros. series in a solo focused adventure, full of  chickens and frogs to punch, things to explore, and secrets to find!\nDive into 6 worlds, each one of them being a subtle satire of our own world.  From the destruction of the environment to the exploitation of the  animals, through the pollution of the seas and the impacts of high  consumerism, Decline's Drops, without being a moral speech, has a lore  focused on these different aspects of society. This also allows a great  diversity regarding the level design, which is something we'll talk  about later.\nIn Decline's Drops, you'll travel through old-school crafted worlds,  each and every element being placed for an intended and specific  purpose. Following the rules of the greatest game/level designers,  everything has a role to play. The drops you collect give you HP  bonuses, but also allow you to buy things at the shop. Defeating enemies  will grant you more power, but beware: if you're hit by them, you lose  that power!\nUnlike other platformers, Decline's Drops has a gameplay focused on  combat: Globule has a wide range of various attacks adapted to every  situation. From the classic jab to the powerful back air, enemies will  make you use every one of them! But wait, there\u2019s more: as you progress  through your adventure, Globule will learn new special moves, such as a grab-&-throw attack, the Super Punch or the almighty GLOVE. These  special moves will allow you to reach new horizons and will greatly help  you during tough fights.\nMini-games, mid-bosses that block your way, submarine gloves, Arcimboldo tanks... Decline's Drops will offer great diversity, a strong and solid gameplay being the main focus.\nThis is the current World Map. Design is subject to change.\nAs mentioned before, each world is a satirical portrayal of some aspects of our society. Let's take a look at some of them:\nFORMER FIELDS\nConcept Art - Former Fields\nThe first World of Decline's Drops. This place used to be a peaceful  land but with the arrival of the Decline, everything started to change  and is no longer what you see above.\nAs you'll progress through the game, you'll notice how much the Decline has an impact on the world Globule lives in.\nPetroleum Port\nRainy and stormy, Petroleum Port always has been quite a dark place. The Decline added a vast, sticky black sea, swarming with mouldy Frogmos all over the place. In its deepest abyss lurk mysterious and dangerous  foes... In other words, watch out.\nVanitas\nAll is vanity and chasing after the wind.\nVanitas stages are... Specials. \nWorlds of gold, emerald, poison and strange gold monuments, the Vanitas world is quite an ominous one. Time seems to be stopped and you feel something, or someone is watching you, wherever you are...\nVanitas stages are the hardest ones in Decline's Drops. They'll test your skill at a high level, so you'd better be prepared. There's actually a hidden Vanitas stage in the Kickstarter demo. Give it a try... If you dare.\nYou'll find one Vanitas level in each world, and you'll be able to access them after fulfilling certain conditions.\nGlobule\nGlobule is the main character and hero of Decline's Drops. She is a mouthless wooden puppet with the cutest poker face you could imagine (yes, it is possible). Nonetheless, she seems to be able to eat as it is one of the few things she really enjoys. Globule aspires to nothing but tranquility, and when that tranquility is in danger, she has her gloves  who give her an incredible ability at convincing people to appear  more... \"friendly\".\n Eternal Corp. & the Six Hydra's heads \nEndless growth. Endless possibilities.\nBehind the events of Decline's Drops, there is a name, and that name is  the Eternal Corporation. They created - or have been created by - the  Decline, have made most of the Frogmos, and their desire is to grow,  more and more, endlessly. The Eternal Corporation is managed by only one member, Cortupiro. But the thing is, Cortupiro is a Hydra, and as a Hydra, Cortupiro\u2019s body has six heads, and yet somehow has managed to detach its heads and give them unique bodies so they could focus on their own tasks.\nRavage\nRavage is the least intelligent head. As the ruler of the Former Fields, his task is to produce more and more crops using the tools coming from the Laboratory. Unbeknownst to him, these \"tools\" have also had an  impact on his own health, and as a result, a second little head has started to grow on him. Sick and weak-minded, he's easily upset and  aggressive when things don't go the way he wants.\nMutorpeel\nObscure and silent, Mutorpeel hides its sagging body in the deep ocean,  spreading dark, viscous pieces of itself all over the sea. Its task is  unknown, and nobody knows if it\u2019s even aware of what it is doing.\nThe Frogmos\nConcept art of upcoming Frogmos.\nConsequences or creations of the Eternal Corp., Frogmos are everywhere  on the Island. Somehow adapted to their environment, Frogmos are  unwillingly hostile creatures, most of the time. Tiny or gigantic,  ominous or pathetic, they will block Globule\u2019s path at every corner.\nEvery animation in Decline's Drops is hand drawn, frame by frame. There is no limit with traditional animation,allowing great expressiveness and giving unique personnality to each element in the game.\nGlobule's Up Air animation process\nAnimation process of the \"Testard\"\nMockup for the Physical Switch version. Design is subject to change.\nKICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE COVER ART FOR NINTENDO SWITCH PHYSICAL COPIES\nWe've got lots and lots of different rewards for those who want to support our project!

A great soundtrack is one of the most  important things in a video game. Soundtracks composed by Koji Kondo,  Hiroki Kikuta, Manami Matsumae or Toby Fox are some great examples.  Decline's Drops's soundtrack is created by the great ModalModule, an  incredibly talented and versatile artist. Owner of the \"ModalEffect\",  that power grants him the ability to create music that only gets better  the more you listen to it. Have no doubt, check it out by yourself:\nOn the other side, SFX will be created by Pixel Audio, who have proven their talent at making powerful sounds in various games such as Jotun, Lara Croft GO and Spiritfarer.\nThere's also a whole bunch of great musicians that will bring their talent to Decline's Drops. I did some of the songs in the game too.\nAbout that guy...\nNow I guess it's the moment where I have to show off, right? Well...\nHello, hi, good morning, good evening, \"bonjour\". The name is Marc,  Drazglb. or Rubix' Man, I'm 25 and I am the creator of Decline's Drops.  Passionate video game lover, my childhood was filled with the enchanted  worlds of Nintendo games, but also Crash Bandicoot, Spyro, and many more. One night, just as I was about to fall in the arms of Morpheus, the image of  a little character with big, blue gloves appeared right in front of me .  From this moment I knew I had to make my own game, a game I would really enjoy myself. Without any knowledge, I started to learn how to  code and animate. Making a game is such a great experience and a unique  way to express myself. I won't stop anytime soon!\n\nFirst Press Games\nWe have the chance to collaborate with First Press Games who specialize in providing great and unique physical game releases, making it possible to offer beautiful boxes, good old manuals, and obviously goodies, like CD soundtracks, wonderful collector coins and even plushes right from the start of this Kickstarter! We know how important physical versions of video games are (we do love them ourself) and that's exactly what First Press Games helps us to offer. They will also assist me with the console publishing in general.\nDecline's Drops started out as a hobby project less than two years ago,  and somehow it still is. My current situation allows me to focus on the  game's development during my free time, but this is only for a matter of  time. I have a family and I can't keep going on this way forever. To be more precise, I won't have the opportunity to work on Decline's Drops if I have another job. \nI've been thinking about it a lot and Kickstarter seems to be the best  way to create Decline's Drops the way I would want, without any  constraints. It is also a great way to communicate with you, and as a backer of several projects myself, I love the concept of rewards! \nYour support will allow me to spend all of my time working on the  project without being afraid for the future of my family. With your  support, I will be able to pay the talented artists working on the  soundtrack and the SFX who will dedicate their time to provide you the  best experience possible!\nAt this stage, the first world is almost done. There's still a lot of things to draw, stages to design, but the scenario is complete, and I know exactly where I am going. If everything goes well, the game should be released for the end of the year 2021 or early 2022.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is a Kickstarter project, so, by definition, it implies some risks. I also totally understand that my lack of experience can look very risky, to say the least. That is why I released a demo 3 months ago, and seeing the incredible amount of great feedback, it seems my work has some great potential. If you're unsure about this, check out the latest demo; what you'll see in it is basically a less enhanced version of what will be in the final product.\nI am also very picky and critical regarding my work, as well as passionate, and I believe this is a guarantee of the quality of the project. I'll do everything I can to provide a game of great quality.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac5 or more", "title": "Thank you!", "descp": "Thank you so much for supporting Decline's Drops!

Up to 15 unique songs by Daniel Ingram! \nThe lyrics serve as a telegraph for the gameplay\nAttacks drop to the beat of the music with rhythm-based battles \nMusic adapts to the way you play\nDifferent gameplay experiences and battles for each song to engage the player in new and more interesting ways, as to not get repetitive\n A large and unique cast of characters, each with their own backstories, personalities, and charm \n A cheerful and cute exterior masking a deeper and darker story \nOptional sing-a-long mode for every song\n Accessible! We think it\u2019s important for everyone to have the chance to play, read our full list of features here \nOptional local split-screen co-operative gameplay between Billie and Oscar\nAfter learning that she has incredible magic powers that she inherited from her father, Billie was made an apprentice of the amazing Aristotle, the Axolotl, who will mentor her throughout the game and teach her new spells. Billie has a wide range of skills. \nGlide\nUsing magic Billie can use a low-level telekinesis spell, letting her glide slowly to the ground with the help of her trusty umbrella wand. \nBroom Brolly\nBillie extends her closed umbrella into a broomstick and rides around on it for extra speed, it can glide over hazards such as lava, water, quicksand, and more. \nUmbrella Shield\nBillie\u2019s umbrella creates a shield around her, it has its own health bar. It restores its health over time if it is not in use. It will start to crack as its health depletes. When Billie releases her shield it makes a small shockwave that pushes enemies back, the strength of the shockwave depends on how much HP remains on the shield. \n Water Brolly\nWhen opened, it can rain inside Billie\u2019s umbrella. The rainwater regrows grass in the spots where Oscar has been digging. It can put out fires, help grow seeds, and turn lava into a temporary rock platform. \nInvisi-billie-ty\nBillie is temporarily invisible and can only be seen by enemies with heat vision goggles. Her invisibility will be removed if damaged or if the endurance meter runs out. The meter refills when the skill is not in use.\n Flight \nBillie grows wings formed from magic! Using a strong telekinesis spell she can lift herself into the air with short bursts of magic. She can flap 3 times for extra height and glide in between.\n Magic Decoy\nBillie will summon a personalized item that will distract its target, however, the item will be only effective for a limited time period. \nUmbrella Bounce\nOscar can bounce off Billie\u2019s umbrella when it is open, this includes when she is gliding. Billie can also open her umbrella on the ground and is fully mobile when using it but cannot use abilities.  \nDig\nOscar\u2019s dig move will leave a pair of holes at the entry and exit points that serve as a teleport. There can be 3 sets of holes at a time, both Billie and Oscar can use them.\nFreeze\nBillie pulses out a frost shockwave that freezes enemies and water within its radius. Billie can freeze any nearby water to create temporary platforms of ice. \nSmell-o-vision\nSee important items, allies, and enemies, through walls. The controller will begin vibrating if close to a buried item and will vibrate more violently the closer the player is to an item. The controller will pulse vibrate when ready to dig.\nRewind\nBillie, and Billie ALONE, travels backward through time. Can be used for puzzles or to recover from platforming mistakes. Holding down the key rewinds Billie, releasing the key stops the rewind. \nThere will be many different Outfits for you to collect for both Billie and Oscar. These can either be sold by local vendors in exchange for your hard earned Bells or found in the world by exploring and solving puzzles.\nYes you can! Pamper your best friend in Oscar's Petting Game. You can wash him when he gets dirty, feed him treats, unlock new toys and costumes and much more. Check out the video below for an early preview of what to expect in the full game.\nPLAY\n\nWe will be releasing on Steam and offering DRM free copies on PC. Whilst we want to release on all consoles, this can be hard with a limited budget. We have been approved for Switch developer access, but we cannot promise this until we have the game running on test consoles. However, if we can guarantee a platform release you may change your digital copy to the confirmed console of your choice!\nCurrent community members of Billie Bust Up know that the characters are the bread and butter of this game, boasting tons of personality, each one is dear to us. Their backstories have been fully fleshed out, and each villain gets a song by Daniel Ingram to compliment their aesthetic and to their motive and personality. The heroes will also get their own songs to truly make this a musical adventure.\nThere are four major villains' in total, from left to right we have Fantoccio the puppet, Dutch the wolf, Elaine the cat pirate Queen and Barnaby the party ghost owl. Each worlds theme has a unique flair and concept to keep the gameplay interesting and fun.\nBillie and Oscar\nBillie's voice is by Amber May! Her voice has previously featured in Pokemon Journeys as Camille, Kemono Friends, and Vindictus.\nAristotle the Axolotl\nAristotle is a wandering traveler, talented and knowledgeable in the ways of magic, a true mentor figure! They pitch up a tent in the enchanted forest an recruit Billie as a magic prot\u00e9g\u00e9. \nWatch the fully voiced storyboard of Aristotle below. Aristotle is voiced by Edward Bosco, best known for his work as Alastor in Hazbin Hotel and Ed in SFV. \nPLAY\n\nThe Treehouse \nBillie and her friends, Lou and Lily, spend a lot of their time inside the treehouse, serving as one of Billie\u2019s main hubs throughout the game.\nElaine\u2019s level is a sprawling large cat pirate city, with lots of places to climb and explore. A lot of the designs for the buildings were based around cat toys, and there are plenty of hidden cat faces around the map, can you spot them all? \n You've found yourself a prisoner to the Cat Pirate Queen Elaine, in an attempt to find the secrets to your magic-wielding abilities.     \n Billie sets out on her very first mission, is immediately captured by cat pirates, and taken prisoner by the terrifying Captain Elaine. Now, she must escape, and steal the gem back from the pirates! This level contains stealth segments and a giant cat pirate city to explore.   \nView Elaine\u2019s voiced storyboard below! Elaine's voice is provided by Melissa Medina! Previous work includes playing Mindy from Holofist and Lucy von Deita on Wild Card.\nPLAY\n\nBillie has managed to convince Dutch, owner of a renowned hotel, to give her a job. Juggle working under the direction of Hayes in this lavish establishment and finding the powerful gem Dutch is hiding! \nView Dutch\u2019s voiced storyboard below! His voice is provided by Uncle Ali!

Can Billie put up with his theatrical antics, find the gem, and annoy him into letting her go? \nFantoccio is an extremely egotistical puppet with a napoleon complex and a flair for the dramatic. \nHe has a short temper and will snap if provoked, especially when mocked about his short stature or name. He enjoys character roleplay and acting and will often dress up as multiple characters in his plays as he rarely wants to share the spotlight.   \nView Fantoccio\u2019s voiced storyboard below! Fantoccio's voice is provided by Michael Kovach! Previous work includes playing Angel Dust on Hazbin Hotel and Rocky from Lackadaisy, the animated short.\nPLAY\n\nBillie Bust Up is a musical game, and naturally the music is extremely important. You can hear some examples of the environmental music below, composed by the very talented Gooseworx. Examples demonstrated here are for the cat pirate level, The Goat Escape.\nThere are plenty of good rewards for pledging to our Kickstarter, a lot being exclusive to Kickstarter itself. Once the stock runs out, it will be gone forever. From pins, to plushies, to drawn pieces of concept art, you can also feature inside the game itself as an NPC, or help us create a boss battle! (musical song not included) Below are some prototypes and examples of what to expect!\nExclusive Skins\nYou can pick from a line up of exclusive skins , only on Kickstarter! \u00a33 for any skin via an add-on, one is included free in the Digital bundle, and 4 are included for the digital deluxe pack! Our current line up includes special villian skins for Billie that gives her a custom idle and unique responses from the villains.\nFantoccio is unamused\nLooking cute in a Barnaby onesie!\nPins \nT-Shirts\nPlushies\nBETA Access\nYou will receive access to each chapter as it is polished and ready! meaning you don't have to wait for release day! Some aspects may still change from the BETA to the full release.\n\nALPHA Access\nAccess to every single Patreon build until launch! You'll watch as each level goes from block out to polish. Play through the game with storyboards, and roughs, have input and feedback into the final game, and watch as the game grows and changes. Piano demos to final vocals and orchestration, the works! \n\nThanks to Kickstarter we have official add-ons! Customize your tier here with the below prices.\n\n\n Our game has been planned out from start to finish. Each mission and script laid out with a cost and a project plan, we know exactly how much this game will take to make. Most of our budget thus far has come from grants and self funding, which we have put into polishing Fantoccios boss fight, his song and design. We doubt we can hit the games full budget in one Kickstarter and will seek external funding for the rest of our goal.\n\nWe don\u2019t want to extend our current scope past what we\u2019ve already planned for the game, but we\u2019ve laid out the breakdown above for each levels cost. The more we fund and unlock the less we need to get from investors, making it easier to fund but also letting us keep a bigger percentage of the game! We plan to make the entire game regardless, this is a intense passion project, but the more money here we get the easier the process will be and the better quality work we can deliver!\n\n\nBillie Bust Up has been a passion project of ours for almost 3 years now. Starting as a game jam it slowly grew in popularity and our vision expanded with it. We wanted to make something we were proud of, and last year we restarted the project when we discovered our USP, making the game a musical! A lot of our team members started out as members of the community first and have a great passion for the game and what they do. We can't be more thankful for everyone's support thus far, and hope you'll stick around for the rest of the journey!  So, let's meet the people behind the game!\n We have planned out every single cost exactly, a lot of money goes into the music, art, animation and design. Our current estimated release date is 2024, as we want to produce a high quality game that we can be proud of. Our team is small but trusted, and we are cautious to expand above our means.  However, we have been extremely open via our funding on Patreon, and on Discord throughout our development and will continue to do so here as well! \n Backers at the alpha and beta testing tiers will be able to play the game as we work on it also. \n We\u2019ve been approached by several interested publishers and investors, but all of them have repeated the same critique, that our game simply doesn\u2019t have enough content outside of the boss fight to risk investment. We spent a lot of our funds and time working below minimum wage to produce Fantoccio\u2019s boss fight as a proof of concept for our unique selling point. Along with perfecting the platforming mechanics to be precise, tight, and fun to play within an empty room. Although Billie Bust Up has been in concept for 3 years, it\u2019s only been a year in development, with us scrapping most of our old work back in 2019 when we fully realized what we wanted from this game and its story.\nWe have been fortunate to receive support in the form of several grants and scholarships, along with the help of our community over on Patreon. However, this money has been drip-fed slowly as to keep James and Katie working full time on the project, but this meant next to no money left over to spend on hiring additional staff to help with concept art, particle effects, music, etc. We want to make a big push on funding to get the game to a point in which we can receive external funding.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe want to do this game right, it is extremely important to us that the game reaches our vision and personal goals for quality, thus our team is quite small. We work with people who are equally passionate about the game and that we can trust to do a good job.

Call Me Under takes place in the mysterious underwater city of Styx, a haven inhabited by humans, sirens, and a host of unknown otherworldly entities. \nThis is our first non-episodic project and will be released as a full game. We are aiming for a Fall/Q4 2021 release on Steam, itch.io, and Nintendo Switch (eShop). \nCall Me Under is rated Mature 17+ for strong language, sexual themes, dark humor, violence, body horror/blood, and eldritch horrors.\nPlay as a choice of two different faceless protagonists from The Surface seeking to leave their past behind and start fresh in a new city, even if it is one only rumored to exist at the bottom of the ocean. They do say there's nothing like a clean slate...\nBut maybe not if you find yourself thrown into the middle of a brewing fight between the Shadows and the Light; two ancient, otherworldly entities embroiled in a centuries-long battle for power. \nLike any city, Styx's heart is its most ancient place. Neighborhoods sprawling outward from that 'heart' have gradually taken on more modern, reassuringly mundane appearances, but the abyss where its most ancient lives once began is a dark, deep, and ruined place. Grand cathedrals now have fallen to disrepair, the entities they once honored forgotten to time. Rundown cobblestone streets where only peculiar, adapted lichen and moss provide light. Shadows, eerily like people and not quite, flit to and fro.\nDiscover and unlock new areas around the city.\nEven in the more well-lit and recent parts of Styx, the ghosts linger. Those who died were wrapped up and sent out to the sea to be given back to the depths but, unfortunately, not everyone 'leaves'. Ghosts coexist with the living, looking like they belong until you look too hard. Coy sirens patrol \u2014 or perhaps infest \u2014 the waters outside of Styx\u2019s beautiful glass tunnels. Every Friday, like clockwork, the cheerful mayor\u2019s voice booms over the announcement system...\n\"What a beautiful day to be in the safe embrace of Styx!\"\nOur story begins on a night that will change the lives of everyone in Styx. Something significant. You\u2019ll feel a shift in the current and discover that the ripple-effect won\u2019t stop until you find the source. \nIn our demo, you will play as The Human; one of our two protagonists. You felt the quake, saw a vision of a stranger covered in blood, and now the city seems to whisper to you. Dark magic is at play here, and you\u2019ll need to seek out the blood-soaked man before you can feel any relief from the voices that call out to you.  \nPlayer Roles\nWe have two player characters for you to choose from when starting the game: The Human and The Skia. Each character comes with a different background and, depending on who you choose, a different journey throughout Styx. \nYour path will be determined by the choices you make as you unravel the secrets of the city, and you will also influence those around you depending on if you lean towards the Shadows, or if you'd rather seek out the Light. \nHuman or Half-Siren? Both will lead you on different journeys...\nThe Human\nHaving recently arrived from The Surface, you find yourself thrust into the capable hands (and employment) of Penelope Sinclair; Editor of the Styx Journal, but most significantly leader of Scott & Sinclair investigations. Your past is shady, but your convictions are nothing but a memory here in Styx. Call it a much-needed new beginning, if you will. A second chance to start somewhere fresh where nobody knows your name. You have a job, a place to live, and a host of shit that's about to be thrown into your lap. Here's hoping your sea legs are steady because life is about to get real choppy. Settling into a new city can be a real headache...\nIn choosing The Human, you will find yourself in the grasp of the Shadows. You will be guided by Blue Kastor.\nThe Skia \nYour story began long before you came into this world when your relatives escaped the watery grip of Styx through unknown means to escape to The Surface. The call of the Shadows, however, is inescapable for a half-blood like you. It swells in you like a deafening melody, calling you home. Back into the sea and into the place that the Light can't reach. Into Styx.  Headaches and other whispers your mind can't decipher plague you, but your soul remembers. Fortunately, your arrival was as expected as it was ordained, and you were able to get a place to live and a job with Penelope Sinclair as a rookie journalist, and you've been able to forget that you aren't necessarily here of your own free will. However, you'll need to wake up soon and start asking questions before the deep starts to consume you... \nIn choosing The Skia, you will find yourself in the grasp of the Light. You will be guided by Adrien Navarre.\nOh, the yearning... (Adrien & Blue)\nLove Interests\nStyx is host to a number of interesting characters, from a jaded private investigator to a cryptic medium, you're sure to find someone that piques your interest. We have six individual romances and you can also play the game without entering a romance.   \nThere will be clearly marked options when it comes to more intimate choices for those who wish to avoid that, and we also have two polyamorous routes; Callie + Penny, and Blue + Adrien. Call Me Under is our very first voiced game too, with all of our love interests\u2014plus one non-romanceable character\u2014having incredible voice actors to bring them to life.\nRobbie Daymond is a Native-American Voice Artist, Actor, and Performer based in Los Angeles.

Certain areas and interactions may help your journey more than others, so decide if you want to trust your head or your heart. \nPut on your thinking cap...\nInvestigate \nYou might work for Penny as a reporter at the Styx Journal by day, but by night you assist her with the growing missing person's cases that are plaguing the city. As the story progresses \u2018The Missing\u2018 will pile up, and it's down to you to gather as much information as you can about who they were, and where the hell they went. Our interactive case board will help you keep track of that information, and you can add evidence that you find along the way.\nEgan's disappearance sets our whole story in motion.\nCodex and Audio Logs\nOur codex will have multiple sections for stories and lore, but the most fun feature we're adding to this section is our audio logs. Speak to characters and investigate areas to retrieve tapes voiced by our actors to further assist your cases. \nA quiet morning with Callie & Penny\nCharacter Relationships\nAccess your case file from the menu to view your relationships with our main characters, including a special page area for whoever you choose to romance. Do they trust you? Do they kind of want to fight you or kiss you? Only time (and your actions) will tell! \nCollectibles and Keepsakes\nWhen you return home, you\u2019ll be able to view your collection of keepsakes and collectibles that you gather along the way. Be it a simple business card or an unwanted crystal, or maybe even a gift from the object of your affection. Decide if these items are important enough to turn in as evidence to your investigations, or if you need to keep them to yourself... \nThe Doctor will see you now.\nMultiple 'Good' and 'Bad' Endings\nWith two different player roles and eight romances, there are a number of potential outcomes to your Call Me Under experience. At Lunaris Games, we don't believe in always being 'the hero' because, well...being 'evil' is kind of sexy, actually. With the conflicting forces of good and evil constantly pulling at you throughout the story, it's down to you to decide which side you'll take. But beware, some of our love interests aren't down to dance with the Devil, so you might have to break some hearts if yours tells you to walk into the dark. \nPLAY\n\nSoundtrack  \nWe will have a selection of original songs by London-based composer, Dorrell Ettienne.

Help Rocky find out why he was kidnapped and tortured in a hospital where strange things happen. Explore Los Angeles in the 1950s through bar fights, mysterious investigations, and a lot of twists.\nThis is the second game made by La Poule Noire, creator of Edgar - Bokbok in Boulzac and it is with great joy and pride that we are going to adapt the novel To Hell With The Ugly by the famous French author Boris Vian.\nA colorful storytelling game\nA witty and unconventional investigation story.\n  An unique and humourous take on the eugenics ideology of the era.\n  Stunning 50's Californian atmosphere.\n  Dynamism\n Turn based fights with timing-oriented skills.\n  A fast paced story with lot of twist.\n  Player-friendly\n Easy-to-learn, suitable for beginners.\n  For short to medium sessions without frustrating hassles.\n\nInvestigate the area and explore detailed sceneries with a strong 50's California vibe.\nFind clues and elements about a weird case by talking with NPCs, solving puzzles or interacting with the environment.\nChoices matter !

He promised himself he would not lose his virginity until he is 20 years old. But one night at the Zooty Slammer nightclub he is drugged, abducted and locked naked in a room with a young woman determined to make him break his vows.\nRock resists, and men then administer electric shocks to him. When he comes to his senses, he is, with all his belongings, on the side of a road. Rock decides with his friend Gary to investigate...\nThe story takes place in the America of the 1950s, and we draw inspiration from the most important art movement of the era.\nThe environments and characters are constructed with colour planes reminiscent of the colour-field painting movement, which is characterized by large canvases where colour planes dominate and surface details are rare.\nFilters create a vintage feel and bring a scratched and flayed look like old posters, harking back to the aesth\u00e9tics of the 50's. Retro fonts can also be used for the UI.\nFinally Boris Vian criticizes the superficial side of men by inventing caricatured characters (example: the main character is as beautiful as a god), so we will orient the design of the characters in this direction.\nThe music is very inspired by the American 50's with Jazz, Blues and the early Rock of Elvis. The brass instruments will be the driving force behind the music of the game to bring rhythm to the battle scenes and intensity to the story.\nHere is the first track : \n In alphabetical order :\nAll our physical rewards will be manufactured by local companies and in an ethical manner.\nBecause the subject of our game is unconventional, we want to present it to our Kickstarter community and make sure that it can connect with as many people as possible.\nWe are now co-produced by ARTE France, which is already supporting us in this first pre-production phase. A legitimate question you might ask yourself about this co-production is why we are looking to kickstarter for an additional source of funding. Quite simply because ARTE is a partner, not a sponsor, and its contribution does not cover all of our costs. So we continue to look for funding.\nAnd since La Poule Noire is a worker cooperative, we are very attached to the community spirit. We would be very happy to be able to grow it and include as many people as possible in this new project. Come and help us build this new adventure!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis new game is our most ambitious yet. THWTU is a narrative game but we're adding a lot of point and click mechanics and a combat system. On top of that we decided to acquire the rights to Boris Vian's book and we want to make sure that the game is as enjoyable for those who have read it as it is for those who haven't. Finally Boris Vian's family must also be satisfied with the work done by La Poule Noire and it would be a pride for us to know that they liked the game. \n\nBut don't panic. We know what we are doing and this project is a very motivating challenge. To begin with, the game is not that different from our first game, so all the tools we created back then are being reused. Our process being already largely validated we were able to focus on the new mechanics and thus shorten our pre-production. We all work remotely, all the money raised will be used to pay salaries, nothing else, as we already have all the hardware and licenses we need. Same for the console dev kits, we already did it, we know how to do it, it will be done no matter what! \n\nIn contrast to the majority of game studios, we are a cooperative and this is something very important to us. Our whole business philosophy is based on mutual aid, solidarity and community. The money that each person will have the generosity to give us will be invested for the good of the project.

PayPal donation \npaypal.me/2for2team\nThe World Union has collapsed, the nations are divided into coalitions \"East\" and \"West,\" a mysterious intelligent infection is forcing people to live under city lockdown. This is the world that needs saving\u2013the world of KAPIA.\nAmidst the chaos, Stefan, a retired pilot and a strong-willed grandfather, takes on the responsibility of ending the conflict. Little does he know his most powerful ally will be his little granddaughter, Reny.\nRelease\n2021 Q2 on Steam and GOG.\nController or Point-and-click\nA traditional point-and-click flow with an easily accessible drop-down inventory. To make things more exciting, we added a first-person close-up menu where you can interact with various items.\nor\nPlay KAPIA with your controller and enjoy a modern game flow from your couch.  \n\nPlay for both characters\nPeople have different sides to them; the same goes for characters in KAPIA. Discover the story from different perspectives as you play for both Stefan and Reny. Follow their own unique paths to achieve a common goal.\nUnique 3D design\nEnjoy a carefully crafted environment that suits the unusual combination of medieval architecture and futuristic gadgets. Intelligent robots walk the streets of stone pavement, power banks light up antique lamps, while typewriters serve as input devices for powerful computers.\nPuzzles and mini-games\nJust like in traditional point-and-click most puzzles are tied up with objects, but there are also conversational puzzles and a whole bunch of logical mini-games. \nVoiced dialogues\nWe selected voice talents from all over the world based on their acting skills, and they didn\u2019t disappoint. Each actor brought to the game a part of their own experience making the world of KAPIA truly multinational.\n The long-run of the game will take approximately 5 hours. However, if you decide to dive into the world of KAPIA and explore our story-driven adventure more deeply, the game will take you much longer. If you want to know exactly how this estimate works, try playing the demo version. It should take around 90 minutes.\nThe entire game was built around contrasts. Stefan and Reny are very different, but they are also a family. As you play the game, you will learn about aspects of their identities that make this pair representative of the world that Stefan and Reny are on the quest to heal.\nEach level is designed for either Stefan or Reny.\n Gameplay example for each character:  \n Levels that feature Stefan is where you learn the background story. Puzzles are more dialogue-oriented and the gameplay experience is tilted towards thoughtful and mysterious awareness.\n   Reny\u2019s levels are designed to have less narrative and more mechanics-oriented puzzles. Reny will be your window into private relationships between the characters as they open up in their attitude towards a small girl.\nKAPIA is a story-driven point-and-click adventure executed in the classical style of 3D quests from the mid-2000s.\nOur two-person development team are big fans of games of the \u201cgolden age\u201d in point-and-click, such as Full Throttle, Grim Fandango, The Longest Journey, Still Life, and Syberia. These games shaped our taste for game development and for point-and-click as a whole.\nFive years ago, in Latvia, the idea for our point-and-click adventure KAPIA took its final form. Self-funded and produced by our family, our game encompasses a wide range of people and their ideas from different parts of the world. \n2for2 is a husband and wife team.\nWe\u2019ve been together for 17 years, 15 as a married couple and business partners. From the very start of our common journey, we decided to spend as much time together as possible, and we stuck to that promise.\nAs a freelance team, our career revolves around special effects for movie production, programming for 3D engines, architectural visualization, game asset development, educational simulation, and many more game development related jobs.\nOur job and lifestyle make us very mobile. For the last 10 years we\u2019ve traveled the world, staying in a different country for 2-4 years at a time. It hasn\u2019t always been easy, but we value the experience of diving into different cultures.\nAll you need is a mouse to explore the world of KAPIA. Click to walk, click to talk, click to interact. It is that simple.\nRight-click \u2192 Your interaction with objects and characters.\nLeft-click \u2192 Cancels the action.\nMiddle-click \u2192 Brings up the close-up of the inventory.\nThere is an autosave feature, so you don\u2019t need to worry about losing your progress.\nController support is available! Play KAPIA from your couch. \nFour years in development\nKAPIA is our first game, and we had to learn a lot before we could build our own, unique pipeline. We wrote scripts to minimize the manual work, arranged data transfer, tried different engines, and backed a Kickstarter for PERCEPTION NEURON motion capture.\nThe result of this overall investment shows in the fully animated dialogues throughout the game, thought out story, and uniform quality of the entire project. Basically, we did a lot of preparation work before we even started making the game.\nAnimation\nThere is a lot of animation work in KAPIA. We animated every dialogue, every interaction with objects, and of course the world itself.\nWhile we handcrafted the first-person animations that you see throughout the game, using motion capture was a huge collaboration when it came to dialogues.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWith some heavy budgeting, we managed to self-fund the development from the beginning. Right now, we are asking you to help us support the final portion.\n15% of the core budget will go to a composer that we want to bring to the project. Custom music is important, and we want to provide this experience to the players.\n22% of the budget will cover the remaining voice-overs. We funded the current ones in the demo, but with 30000 words, voiced dialogues for KAPIA don't come cheap.\nThe development itself will take around 40% of the budget. Both of us need to be full time on the project to have it finished by 2021 Q2.\nThe rest will cover taxes and Kickstarter fees, which add up to 23% of the budget.\nIf we can go beyond the initial goal, there is an array of very important stretch goals that will become available as we progress.\nIMMEDIATELY UPON RELEASE:\nKickstarter specials\n KAPIA Box Version \n\nT-shirt \n Digital Artbook \nOur Digital Artbook is an opportunity to get behind the scenes of making the KAPIA game. Every asset in our world was crafted specifically for KAPIA.\nOver the past two years, we\u2019ve been making short videos about asset creation. Our artbook will feature selected videos that were collected, sorted, and completed with explanations.\nPLAY\n\n Your drawing on the loading screen \nKAPIA is inviting artists to become a part of our game development team. We'll ask you, or your young artist if you have a child in mind, to create a drawing on the proposed topic. For example, \"Grandpa is skiing.\" After we receive the drawing, we'll redraw it to fit the storyline. Your initial art along with an altered picture will become a loading screen.\nYou will receive a video of the loading screen to show your friends and family. The first name of the artist will appear on the special part of the credits section.\nAs an additional reward, you will receive a custom digital artist diploma.\n Customize an NPC Robot \nThere are just a few NPC robots in the game, and you get to customize one of them.\nThere is a choice of a hat, a hairstyle, or a scarf that you can design for a robot. You can make your own sketch or take a picture of something you already have or like. We will transfer your idea into a 3D model and will include your NPC into a final copy of our game.\nIn addition, you get to name your NPC Robot. Some naming restrictions may apply, so please be reasonable.\n\n Name an NPC Robot \nPlease be reasonable! Come up with a name of your own. Don\u2019t make it too long or something inappropriate. No one enjoys negativity in adventure quests.\n\n Your eye color in the game \nYou will send us a picture of your eye or will choose your own color, we will stylize it and feature it in the game as one of the spying eye models scattered around various levels. This will make you a part of the story and the onlooker.\n\n Breathing voice over \nBreath heavily into a microphone and send us the file, this sound will become a voice-over for one of the NPC characters. Your name will be added to credits in a voice-over section.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI can safely say that we will definitely finish the game.

A digital version of the soundtrack is available as a Reward!\nFour playable characters can be selected from the start.  Each has a range of basic, special and RIOT ('Super')moves.  A ferocious wolf joins the fight during some parts of the game!  \n'Iron' Jackson \nFormer gang leader, fighting to regain the power he once had.  A Street fighter, Jackson crushes opponents with a heavy chain.\n\n Ricco  \nA Self-taught, undefeated kickboxer, fighting to exact revenge through grief-fuelled rage!\nSgt. Clay \n A SWAT team cop in too deep with the gangs of Fallen City.  A former Mixed Martial Arts champion.\nNatasha \nAmbitious, reckless, Natasha is skilled in combat helicopter and heavy weapon repair. Armed with a wrench and brutal Tae-Kwondo skills!\nWolf\nLoyal and ferocious, the wolf fights alongside you through some of your journey.  Name him in-game and command him to attack or defend!\nWolf take-down!\n\nThere will be eight stages in Fallen City Brawl, each with hidden areas, often revealed by smashing through destructible scenery.  Two stages are currently playable in game, the rest are in different stages development at the moment, will be sharing more with backers soon!\nStage 1: City Streets \nTake the fight to the city streets and then under the bridge as animated traffic streams overhead, headlights illuminating the brawl below! \nStage 2: Sunrise Gym  \nTrain hard, fight easy! Battle through a boxing gym, gloves off.  Punchbags swing and pillars and walls smash with the impact of the fight!\nDestructible scenary in Sunrise Gym\nStage 3: Stock Car Race Track  \nBurning rubber and exhaust fumes fill the air in a fight though the stadium, down to the pits and across the racetrack whilst stock cars scream past! \nThis stage will be set against a setting sun, changing the way the stage is lit as the fight continues. \nStage 4: Storm Beach  A storm rages and has closed-out the beach.  With cliffs on all sides, huge waves crash down as the fight continues through the surf.\nI'll share more details on stages 5 to 8 as the game continues through its development!\n\nThe fighting system in Fallen City Brawl is fast, hard-hitting and with real depth and scope, featuring combos, counters, parries, throws (including some air-throws), ground n pound, grappling, special moves, and RIOT ('Super') moves - these are available as the blue flaming bar at the bottom of the screen fills up.  Higher combos and counters fill it faster than regular attacks.  Here's a work-in-progress example:\nA key feature is destructible scenery - walls, pillars and doors will crumble and shatter when enemies are thrown into them, causing extra damage and opening up new areas to fight through.  \nThe fight  doesn't stop when enemies are knocked down - all characters can use ground and pound to continue the fight, some can grapple on the floor too.  \nLots of weapons can be picked up and used to help even up the fight- bats, pipes, knives, oil drums, hand guns, assault rifle, shot-gun, crates, grenades, chains and chainsaws! \nSpecial Forces back-up: upgrade-able, heavily armed mercenary attacks clear the screen of enemies with devastating force!  As you fight through the game you can build the level of support you'll receive from the mercenaries, balancing whether to unleash it, or to keep building it to then unleash heavier and more powerful attacks later.  You can see in the trailer mercenaries power-sliding their car into the screen and causing carnage.  Higher levels include a full-on attack from a Hind Mil Mi-24 attack helicopter! \nBattle Mode!\nBattle Mode sets players against each other one-on-one! Play in competitive  two player mode, or fight one player against an increasingly tough series of enemy encounters.  The clip below is quite early work-in-progress, but I'm looking into the possibility of being able to play as ANY character from the game in this mode (including enemies and bosses too!).  \nFallen City Brawl is in development for Steam (PC/Mac), PS4, Switch and Xbox One. Backers will receive a survey after the completion of the campaign to indicate choice of platform.  \nI've self-funded Fallen City Brawl's development so far, investing my own money and time over nearly a three year period.  This has been enough to get the project to where it is today.  However, I aim for Fallen City Brawl to stand toe-to-toe with the best beat 'em ups in the genre.  There's still lots of work to do, and to achieve that standard and be able to release the game in the near future, I really need your help!\nI'm lucky that Fallen City Brawl has a community of passionate supporters.  I hope the Kickstarter campaign will help many more people to hear about the game's development and join our community.  Getting feedback on the project's development has been so important to reach the stage we're at and I'm looking forward to continuing to shape the game with Fallen City Brawl's backers!\nStandard Digital Edition\nAll Reward tiers from Standard Digital Edition and higher include:\n Digital copy of Fallen City Brawl for either Steam (PC or Mac), PS4, Switch or Xbox One on release.

Here's a link to Daniel's You Tube channel  https://www.youtube.com/c/DanielLindholm2BStudio \nThank you to Zehb for the brilliant hand-drawn character artwork throughout this page, along the game's cover artwork that heads up the trailer.

Here's a link to Zehb's Twitter page https://twitter.com/Zehb_BR\nThank you also to everyone who has offered their support, kind words and encouragement with this  project over the past 3 years.  It means a great deal to me and has helped me continue to push to make the game as great as i know it can be!\nMike Wells, creator Fallen City Brawl", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFallen City Brawl's development is progressing well and many key building blocks on the road to competing the game are well-advanced. Two stages of the game are playable using each of the four characters. The core of the combat system - combos, counters, collision detection, running, special moves etc are in place, for some characters a little more developed than others. Music is in development and sounding great. \n\nGetting these foundations in place were some of the challenges that I wanted to overcome before launching the Kickstarter campaign - having these well advanced means I can be confident that development should now take around 10 months. \n\nI'm realistic on setting expectations, conscious of avoiding 'feature creep' and 100% committed to creating an outstanding beat 'em up. I strongly value regular dialogue with people interested in the game's development and understand the importance of communicating progress. I've kept this principle over past couple of years through regular Twitter and newsletter updates and will continue to work closely with the fantastic community which has built up around Fallen City Brawl - through to the release and afterwards!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Mike Wells\nFirst created \u00b7 1 backed\nPassionate about creating an awesome beat 'em up that will stand toe-to-toe with the best in the genre!See more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Supporter", "descp": "Thank you for your support!

Now with your help, I'm looking to branch out into creating more original content. My team and I specialise in blending 2D and 3D animation to create unique art styles that are both efficient and appealing, and we're ready to take these styles into this next big project. The Rhino and the Redbill is a story we've been developing for several years now and have been looking to bring to life through animation. We're seeking funding to create an 11 minute animated action-adventure pilot episode that we can take to festival screenings and industry events, and eventually release publicly for everyone to enjoy. This would ultimately serve as a proof of concept for producing more content. \nThe short is meant to appeal to all ages, dealing with mature themes that adults can appreciate while still being accessible to younger audiences. The tone is meant to fall in the same vein as shows like Samurai Jack and Avatar: The Last Airbender. \nIn the wild, Rhinos and Red-Billed Oxpeckers have a very unique symbiotic relationship. The oxpeckers spend their day nestled on top of the rhino for food and protection, and in return they help to alert the often visually-impaired rhinos if there is danger in the area. They can however, be a nuisance to their hosts, often picking at wounds when searching for food, and their bond can quickly turn parasitic. \nBased on their relationship in the wild, The Rhino and the Redbill is an action-adventure short about a blind rhinoceros named Niles, and a flight-impaired oxpecker named Redford, working together to survive the harsh realities of a drought ravaged wilderness. Scorchwater Valley is dying and it's taking everyone else down with it. It's every creature for themselves as social structures have collapsed and factions of carnivorous gangs, evil cults, and deadly poachers struggle to survive. Niles and Redford have to work together to survive in a dying world, provided they can survive each other.\nConcept art of Redford and Niles\nNiles is a gruff and surly mercenary. He talks a big talk, walks a big walk, and can take down pretty much anyone who challenges him on it. Even though he is legally blind, he doesn't let that stop him from being a force to be reckoned with. The work is still dangerous though, and finding a safe place to call home in the valley is no small task, so Niles reluctantly accepts help from Redford, his trusty guide bird to help him through the treacherous badlands.\nRedford is an upbeat bird who acts as a lookout and navigator for his larger-than-life friend. Red owes a lot of his friendly attitude to how oblivious he is of the dangers around. While he tries to be approachable, he's a bit naive to how irritating he can be, especially to a grouch like Niles. While they clash a lot, Niles and Red remain reluctant friends, and they're stronger together than they are apart.\nThe Rhino and the Redbill is a project that makes use of 2D and 3D animation techniques, to craft a visual style consistent with TV animation standards that is also cost effective to produce. The process involves using 3D models, hand drawn render passes, matte paintings, and more, to create a visual style meant to emulate works such as Samurai Jack and Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse. \nIn the trailer you can see plenty of examples of finished animation to give you an idea of the graphic style that we are striving for. \nCompared to most animated pilots, The Rhino and the Redbill is a relatively inexpensive project. Thanks to the streamlined rendering and rigging processes developed whilst making Breathing Space, we are animating at a fast rate without sacrificing quality.\nTo get this project off the ground, we are starting with a goal of $24,000 CA to develop the 11 minute animated pilot. This money will mostly go towards funding the animation, as that makes up the bulk of what needs to be done. We've already done several scenes to get a sense of how much time it will take to complete the project, and this number will cover the cost of labour for our estimated time frame.\nWe are also offering plenty of stretch goals to help expand the project should we hit our funding goal! Hitting these milestones will allow us to expand our festival run, and add new content such as bonus scenes and opening theme sequences!\nAt the moment we have already done a sizeable chunk of production work, which has allowed us to keep the remainder of the project at a lower cost. So far The Rhino and the Redbill has finished pre-production, with a full story reel completed, and plenty of shots already put into production. The work has been going very smoothly, and with your help, we are excited to take it to the next level.\nIn addition to completing the film, we are also offering some fun rewards to our backers. There are digital bundles that include getting your name in the credits, the downloadable soundtrack, and the digital art book.\nSample Mock Ups of the Art Book\nIf you're looking for physical rewards, we are also offering various acrylic charms and a poster, which all feature artwork of the film's characters.\nSample Mock Ups of the Acrylic Charms (Comes with a Key Chain Ring)\nAt some of our higher backer reward levels, we are offering the opportunity to be involved in the project in more unique ways. This can include getting a producer credit, which gives you plenty of industry cred for sponsoring an independent project, and also gets your name or the name of your company in the opening credits. You can also pledge to have a character of your own design make an appearance in the pilot! (See FAQ for more details).\nWe've had plenty of great and talented people helping to develop this project to what it is today, many of whom have work that can be seen in the trailer. A big thanks to our two leads  Foster \"Adler\" Eber and  Richie Ammons, playing Red and Niles respectively. Both have years of experience with voice acting and have delivered great performances. This project wouldn't have been possible without them. Follow the links to their websites to see more samples of their great work.\nAlso in our talented cast is Rob Schwarb, who has been contributing additional voices to the project. He's got a wide arsenal of unique voices that have gone a long way to bringing our animations to life. Follow the link to check out more of his work.\nWe would also like to thank Joshua David Mitchell for the music he has been providing for the project. We've had some great people helping out with this project, with plenty more we'll be adding along the way. \nIf you want to follow along with the project, be sure to check out the director's Twitter, where we regularly post updates and in progress work from the project.\nThanks for taking the time to check us out. We\u2019re very excited to keep moving forward with this project, and we hope we can count on your support!\nKey art from our previous film \"Breathing Space\"", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAnimation isn't easy, I won't lie.

And because this entire project is digital media and we already have access to the necessary tools and software, the only costs needed to be covered are for labour and merchandise.

Crackinho  Beat' em Up is quite different, because besides the classic brawling, it  adds a lot of special attacks and variations for the same strike.\nThe scenario was 100% made by us, the concepts, 3D models and textures. The traditional 2D animations, inspired by Cuphead, gives it a pinch of charm to the game.\nWe're also planning to launch the multiplayer version and online co-op.\nAs you explore the game, you'll unlock new features for customize the character\n  such as hats, clothes, toys, visual aspects and special attacks.\n  The more you go further the funnier it will become! \n\n Features:\n  Crackinho Beat' em Up in the World is a comical and fresh take on the Retro Fighting Games of the Old Arcades. You can join Crackinho and his Friends on this Adventure with the following Features:\nFight Crime and its Lackeys throughout Cities like S\u00e3o Paulo, Tokyo, Rome, Cairo, London, among others, all in different Time Periods and Parallel Realities!\n  Beat'em up over 5 different Enemies per Level, each with their own Skills, Tactics and Designs, based on the City and Era they are terrorizing, to spice up the Challenge!\n  Discover different Stages as you uncover more Characters, all while having fun in the humorist world of Crackinho!\n  Play with Friends and find Hidden Passages or Bonus Levels!\n  Train in the field of Martial Arts, unleash your inner strength and find said special moves like \"High Dropper\", an attack based on Capoeira, or \"Fiya Laeza\", an Energy Blast from the Tips of your fingers, but never forget to keep an eye on the Mana Bar or else you might end in a tight situation!\n  Just like the Old Timer Arcades, once you go forward there is no coming back, so advance in the Stages at your own risk, for the Levels get harder and there are sure to be awesome Boss Fights at the end!\n   How long is the game?\n  The game is set to have at least 11 different cities to play in. The first level, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil takes about 30 minutes to be complete so the rest will take roughly the same amount of time.\n Ok! It\u2019s so nice and clear, but who is Crackinho?\n  Crackinho is a superhero who was born in the suburbs of S\u00e3o Paulo. He is the result of an unsuccessful lab experiment. And now he and his group have the mission to discover the origin of these problems and combat social injustices.\nThe responsible for all of this is a chemist named Dr. La\u00e9rcio Snow, who created a hallucinogenic and stimulating substance, capable of creating addiction and controlling the entire planet.\nNow Crackinho and his gang must fight crime around the world with a good sense of humor.\nS\u00e3o Paulo Stage\nTokyo Stage\n\nRome Stage\nWe\u2019re at a point right now where the fifth stage of the game is nearly finished. We have already developed the stages for S\u00e3o Paulo - Brazil, Tokyo - Japan, Rome - Italy, Cairo - Egypt and London - England.\nS\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\n  Brazil is where it all began and our super hero is gonna fight crime in the dangerous neighborhoods of S\u00e3o Paulo.\nTokyo, Japan\n  Welcome to Tokyo 2040! After a flood of Tiet\u00ea River, S\u00e3o Paulo, Crackinho falls into a manhole and time travels through a tube which takes him to the future.\nRome, Italy\n   Crackinho uses his super powers again and time travels straight to 15th century. After throwing his flip-flops to the air, it opens a teleportation portal and he arrives at Rome. Now it's time to combat enemies in Renaissance era.\nCairo, Egypt\n Soundtracks\n  We\u2019ve been developing the soundtracks getting inspired on each stage where the game plays.\nHave a look at it!\n Why KICKSTARTER and Budget Overview\n  With your amazing and generous help we will be able to keep our team filled with talented people and keep up with the schedule of the game, delivering you better content and recurring updates, without sacrificing quality.\n Introducing ourselves:\n  Illustrators and Animators\nWe have a team composed of 6 very talented game designers and illustrators.\nDesigners\nThe 2 UI/UX designers are qualified professionals who would like to continue creating and developing the project.\nSoundtracks\nF\u00e1bio Mozine is the creative mind who is composing soundtracks for the 11 stages of the game.\nScoreDraw is our friendly partner who is developing the sound effects and narratives.\nMarketing\nAll we know marketing is crucial nowadays and we\u2019re lucky to have DeSeip by our side helping us to spread this project all over the globe.\nCo-Working Space\nBlack Onyx Interactive has the pleasure to share a nice atmosphere with creative people at Talent Garden Dublin, Ireland and Milan, Italy.\nHardware/Software\nInvest in hardware and licenses, especially of Software Development Kits, which helps us convert the game's code to other platforms.\nTranslation\nWe\u2019re looking for help with translation to various languages, including and not limited to, English, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, French and Japanese.\nShipping\nConsider Manufacturing and Shipping Costs for the rewards.\nKickstarter will, of course, inhale 5% of our funding goal if we are successfully funded, which adds up to at least this amount.\n Who we are\n  Established in 2016 focusing on assisting other companies to develop their software, Black Onyx Interactive had created several robust apps and games along these years.\nIn late 2018 we became a 100% game development company with insanely technical and artistic excellence in our own games ever since.

It is being animated and developed completely by one person (Jeff Mumm).  Music and SFX by Fat Bard.\n In Guinea Pig Parkour, you are, appropriately enough, a guinea pig that does parkour.  You're also in the '90s.  Like totally in the '90s.\n Coffee is the source of your energy.  I mean, if you're like me, it probably is the source of your energy.  But I meant in the game - it's the source of Joe's energy.  \n...Joe's the guinea pig.\nThere's more to Guinea Pig Parkour than just parkour.  When you go indoors or into certain areas, platforming gives way to a more classic adventure game style experience, allowing you to talk to, interact with, and annoy other characters.\nWhen you're a guinea pig, the plumber is a formidable enemy.  You must escape intact before your soul is plunged from your body.\n Each animation in Guinea Pig Parkour is completely hand-drawn by me from scratch, and animated at 24 frames per second, to capture the full, fluid quality of traditional animation, to its best potential.\nHow I made the tourist.\nHow I made the coffee chatters.\nHow I made the plumber boss.\nHere's a time-lapse of the process, 10 hours of work in 30 seconds.\n The music and sound for Guinea Pig Parkour is being created by Fat Bard.\n Guinea Pig Parkour is being developed in Construct 3, which has native exporting to Windows, Macintosh, Linux, and Xbox One.  Windows will be my primary focus, but if Construct is able to seamlessly publish to the other platforms, I will do so.  If all goes well, I will also pursue porting to Nintendo Switch and Playstation.\n English will be the only language available to begin with, but I will pursue localization when possible. \n My biggest inspirations for Guinea Pig Parkour were the games I played growing up in the '90s, especially games that were cartoony or hand-drawn.  GPP actually began as sort of an homage to Disney's Aladdin for the Super Nintendo, but has grown and developed over time.\nSome of my other big influences are Earthworm Jim, Sam and Max: Hit the Road, Day of the Tentacle, Yoshi's Island, Crash Bandicoot 2, and Super Mario 64. \nThe strongest inspiration for Guinea Pig Parkour as a concept was my childhood desire to play a video game that felt like you were inside a cartoon.\n I'm a solo developer and an independent animator.\n I've been drawing since I could hold a pencil.  I started as a young child drawing my own \"Children's Book\" styled stories with drawings.  I then made a natural transition to comics, and started experimenting with animation in Mario Paint for the Super Nintendo and with stop-motion animation.  I continued experimenting with digital animation with any program I could find (which were hard to find back then, at least for a kid).  Around the fifth grade, I learned QBasic and made little text adventure games, as well as started making custom maps for Doom II, and started editing Doom II graphics, making my own characters from eight angles - a bit tedious, but amazing to see my characters come to life in a video game!\nIn high school, I experimented with the Games Factory, Flash animation and continued drawing my comics.  After graduating, I went to school for graphic design, then to a little cartooning school where I studied comics, and finally to an animation school, where I formally learned hand-drawn animation and really refined my artistic skills.  My shifting focus put me in more student debt than I would have wanted, but the learning experience was invaluable.\nAfter animation school, I decided not to pursue animation for hire, as my goal has always been to be an independent artist.  Instead, I worked doing data entry, which allowed me to save all my creative energy for my own projects.   \n The main character of Guinea Pig Parkour is a guinea pig named Joe, who is actually based on my childhood pet guinea pig of the same name.  I started drawings comics and animations about Joe in the third grade.  I continued by making webcomics and some experimental games about Joe from 1998 to 2004.  I then went on to explore other projects, but in 2010, I created \"Guinea Something Good\" - a new take on my childhood character in the form of comic strips and animated shorts.  In 2012, I started developing a new game based on \"Guinea Something Good,\" and in 2015 I devoted all my creative time to creating this project.\nJoe was my pet during the time I was playing the games that influenced GPP.  For me, making Guinea Pig Parkour is, in many ways, a lifelong dream.\n Joe is an average guinea pig, stuck in a cage with other guinea pigs.  One day, his owner spills a cup of coffee, and Joe drinks some out of curiosity.  Instantaneously, he is transformed into the tracksuit-wearing, parkour-performing guinea pig we see in the game!  He is off to explore the world of the '90s, including real life locations like the bedroom, as well as venturing inside paintings, pictures and other hidden worlds.\nPerform parkour in '90s inspired worlds through action platforming.\nExplore open worlds, with mission based objectives (\u00e0 la Super Mario 64).\nTalk and interact with other characters, pick up items, solve puzzles in the style of '90s graphic adventure games.\nFight enemies by jumping, kicking, and more.\nEncounter an interesting boss in every world.  \n I will aim at launching on Early Access by December 2020.  From there, I will continue to polish the game and improve it until it is ready for official release. \nThe Kickstarter funds will go toward allowing me to work full time on the game until it is ready for Early Access, as well as for the music and sound.\n  I am a solo developer, and I have a unique vision.  I've always done my best work on my own, and I would like to retain that level of creative control for this project. Kickstarter will allow me to make the game I want to make without compromises.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenges for this project are that it is my first video game, and, besides music and sound, that I am a one man operation. However, this is why I've chosen to chunk down the game into smaller, more manageable, achievable goals. The goal for the Kickstarter is to get into Early Access because I have completed enough projects and done enough work on the game to know I can accomplish this. From there, with the help of the community, I know I can get a short episode completed and released. Once a complete episode has been released, I will have had enough experience to then confidently create new episodes. I dream big, but at the end of the day, I am a very pragmatic, hard-working person.

I wanted to show you all a song that I've been working on in the past few days. It's my first song of the new year. I wrote it after watching \"Christine\" 3 to 4 times in a row. It's not a horror game, but I want the music to  convey a cinematic feeling of uneasiness, where you know that \"Not all  is well in the world\". I kept it as minimal as possible intentionally.

But... what if that wasn't the case? What if every action you took had consequences? What if each puzzle had truly and wildly different solutions? Sounds pretty revolutionary, right?\nFollow Betty Anderson and Eliza Barret as they unravel a mystery in their sleepy little New Mexico town. With over 15 hours of gameplay, charismatic art, breathtaking environments, and a colorful cast of characters\u2014each of whom has extensive dialogues and intricate backstories\u2014this game will keep you glued to the screen. \nIt also boasts droves of items\u2014each with its own customized description and special role\u2014to use in the game\u2019s complex, challenging, and enthralling puzzles.\nWe spend 100% of our time developing 3 Minutes to Midnight (it would be a higher percentage if we could bend time and space!), but sometimes we post crazy stuff or interesting news, so if you happen to be on Twitter, you might want to follow us by clicking the link below.   \nOf course, if you\u2019d rather follow us on Instagram, we normally post images from events we attend, or everyday studio life.

You can also reach us at press@scarecrow-studio.com if you have any other press related inquiries.  \nIt's the late 1940s and somewhere, in the middle of nowhere, a loud explosion shatters the night. A plucky teenager wakes up with a jolt. Where is she? WHO is she?\nTurns out she is Betty Anderson, and whatever blew up in the desert seems to have wiped her memory clean, but as she\u2019ll soon learn, Betty has a lot more to worry about than amnesia. Like, say, a town full of people who aren\u2019t what they seem, an overly ambitious mayor, a top-secret military base, the mafia, and a potbellied pig with a vendetta. Then there\u2019s this little problem of a doomsday plot counting down to the extinction of the human race\u2026 but she'll get to that later.\nJoin Betty to crack the conspiracy that starts with a bang and ends at 3 Minutes to Midnight\u2014if we\u2019re lucky.\nClassic adventure gameplay\nInspired by such titles as The Secret of Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle, and Sam & Max Hit the Road\u20143 Minutes to Midnight combines the point-and-click gameplay and clever humor with high-definition cartoon art, an intuitive interface, and a compelling mystery.  \nTwo playable characters\nPlay as plucky teenager Betty Anderson and the ambitious and diplomatic mayor Eliza Barret\u2014two characters on opposite sides of the spectrum\u2014to unravel a plot much deeper than one would surmise at first glance.\n A small town of strangers and secrets, all deeply connected \nAll the characters in the game\u2014as well as the world they live in\u2014have a rich and detailed backstory, with clever and unexpected ties to each other. Scratching the surface won\u2019t be enough to discover more than their apparent identities.\nPuzzles up the wazoo \nEveryone knows that puzzles can make or break an adventure game. (Cat hair mustaches, anyone?) After all, most of the challenge comes from figuring out solutions to these convoluted problems. What\u2019s worse than puzzles that are too hard or too easy, though? Having to solve the same kind of puzzle over and over until you feel like eating your controller out of frustration.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve made a special effort to vary the types of puzzles in 3 Minutes to Midnight. You may need to talk to other people in town to figure out an answer\u2014or to get yourself out of a real mess. Some puzzles are progressive, meaning one decision early in the game could dramatically influence how you find answers. The environment may hold clues, but you might also have to rely on your own inherent knowledge. \nWith over 1000 interactable objects and the largest script in point-and-click history, players will be able to use their creativity to figure out many different solutions. In turn, these decisions can influence the outcome of the game and affect which ending the player sees. When we say this game can be replayed, we\u2019re really not kidding! \nReplayability\nWe\u2019re talking hidden dialogue, events, and characters that you might otherwise never see. Maybe that character you kept hearing about wasn't actually real. Or maybe he was\u2026 and just very well hidden.\nMultiple solutions to some puzzles\nMost of our big puzzles have been designed in such a way that there's sometimes more than just the obvious solution. You might find an easy way to solve a problem, or maybe you'll find a secret that unlocks more information about the backstory of our characters.  \nMultiple endings!\nWhen we said replayability, we meant it! The game offers multiple endings, each of them distinct from the others. The endings are drastically different and are determined by how you play the game, giving real stakes to the story. Some finales may be happier than others, so pay attention to your choices! No need to fear \u201cmultiple endings\u201d where the only differences are that the ending cinematics have the camera tilted at a weird angle and everything is tinted some random color\u2014we guarantee it. \n\n Elaborate hint system \nOur built-in hint system will highlight important objects and assist during those tense dialogue options. After all, we wouldn\u2019t want you to get lost (or look for a walkthrough online!) So if you have the need, activate this option... or don't.\n \"That doesn't seem to work.\"\u2014No more! \n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t work\u201d is now a thing of the past! No more will you be stuck hearing the same phrase 5000 times in a row, because we made sure to write 5000 lines of unique dialogue specifically for this reason! All of them clever and funny, of course, for you to discover at your leisure.  \nEaster eggs\nWait, what\u2019s this you picked up off the ground? An Easter egg! During Betty\u2019s (mis)adventures, you\u2019ll have the chance to find lots of Easter eggs. They\u2019re not all three-second jokes or random background details, though. We\u2019re talking elaborate hidden gems. Remember what happened to Guybrush if you left him soaking for too long? If you do, you\u2019ll know exactly what we mean. If not, don\u2019t worry\u2014you\u2019ll develop your own set of elaborate in-jokes once you play the game. Like Ben Zinn\u2019s plumbing, humor is wildly creative and slightly dangerous. (See, that\u2019s an in-joke you don\u2019t get... yet.)\nHidden references\nConsider yourself genre-savvy? Maybe you watch a lot of movies? Then you\u2019ll definitely enjoy hunting for cleverly hidden references to other great works. They may appear as witty book titles or hard-to-spot cameos, but don\u2019t worry\u2014they won\u2019t be taking center stage. After all, 3 Minutes to Midnight has its own stories to tell.\nYes, we made sure to include at least one Star Wars reference... original trilogy, of course. \nWe\u2019ve ensured an expansive and interesting gameplay experience. In fact, we might\u2019ve gone a bit overboard. Early testing of the game took about 12 hours! Considering there was no dialogue and that we knew exactly what we were doing\u2026 you\u2019d probably think we\u2019re crazy! So, get yourselves ready for 15 to 20 exciting hours of gameplay.\nBut don\u2019t worry, our game isn't long because it's clunky. We\u2019ve introduced many quality of life improvements. Want to leave a location faster? Double-click the exit! Feeling lost? Use the hint system. Re-entered a dialogue by mistake? Skip it! Then again, maybe you won\u2019t want to.\nHave we mentioned that our characters have both expressive faces and bodies? It just makes everything so much more dynamic. Take a look below...\n\nIf you're one of those hardcore keyboard-and-mouse players, you\u2019ll appreciate the amount of work that went into making its controls as smooth as possible. On the other hand, if you swear by a controller, you\u2019ll get to experience the best controls ever developed for a point-and-click game. \nAll characters are fully integrated with the game\u2019s backgrounds, thanks to shadow and coloring systems specifically designed for this title. Dynamic lighting affects every scene. No character will ever look like a cardboard cutout in a bad Saturday cartoon show.  \nThe game offers multiple solutions to different puzzles, with many, many conditions that lock or unlock certain information or events. \nHere\u2019s a bit of gameplay for you to enjoy. The first half of the video is brand-new 4K footage exclusive to our Kickstarter, with voice acting and sound effects not yet implemented. If you want to enjoy our talented voice cast, the second half of the video\u2014which is from a demo shown at worldwide events like Gamescom, PAX East, and E3\u2014will give you a fuller experience. Don\u2019t worry, though, we made sure there are no spoilers. For real, we checked. Several times.\nOur game has over 50 characters aside from Betty and Eliza, each with an intriguing backstory, and many of them interconnected. While you unravel the main plot of the game, you\u2019ll learn more about every single one of them\u2014if you want to, that is. Discover hidden dialogues and the special events they lead to. Only the most expert of adventurers will be able to unlock this game in full!\nNow, how about we meet some of the townsfolk?   \nWe want to make the best-looking point-and-click adventure game of all time. That\u2019s why we have some of the best artists working on it. Environments look familiar? That might be because our environment artist, David Puerta, worked on such titles like Yesterday, Runaway, and Broken Sword.\nWe\u2019ve created a huge number of locations for you to explore. All of our backgrounds are painted in 8K resolution and converted to 4K for the final version of the game. Most are panoramic, allowing us to show you beautiful parallax effects and leaving you with even more to discover. But enough explaining, why not take a look? \nSome of our environments are even available during both day and night. Gameplay and situations change with the time of day, and so will the people you encounter.\nIt\u2019s taken us three years to craft 3 Minutes to Midnight\u2019s script. Over FIVE people have worked to make sure the script is rich and engaging, engineered to keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat.\nEvery item, or combination of items, is accompanied by a humorous comment. Some may be more subtle than others, but we think they\u2019re all good for a laugh. Examine any interactable item for a chuckle\u2026 as well as a clue.\nThat\u2019s why you can trust us when we say every aspect of the game has been treated with the utmost care and respect, and the script is no exception. We value a good story as much as we do our art and our game\u2019s integrity.\n\nMost of us have our favorite tunes from these old adventure games stuck in our heads, and no matter how much time passes, their greatness never fades away. We\u2019ve put a lot of thought into developing our soundtrack, choosing only the best in Guy Jones, an award-winning composer for TV, video games, and film. He had the task to create these themes specifically for our game, and he delivered. Nothing beats translating visual art into music! \nHere are a few pieces from our score for you to enjoy:\n3 Minutes to Midnight OST - Cahoon Park, Soon To Be Barret Park\n3 Minutes to Midnight OST - The Rhino Sleeps Tonight\n3 Minutes to Midnight OST - Urgent Repairs, No Matter How Long It Takes\nScareMixer\nAs spooky as it sounds, the ScareMixer is a thing of beauty. Despite its name, we don\u2019t use it to mix scares, but to make sure every musical theme in the game is treated with great respect. No longer will you notice those jarring cuts in audio that you hate so much, seamless transitions from track to track are the way of the future\u2014and that\u2019s why ScareMixer was born. Anyone else thinking about iMUSE\u2122\ufe0f right now? You got the idea. Now, how about we show you what we\u2019re talking about... \nGreat legends of point-and-click, like Roberta & Ken Williams, Ron Gilbert, Tim Schafer, Dave Grossman, David Fox, Steve Purcell, Peter Chan, Hal Barwood, Al Low, Brian Moriarty, Gary Winnick, Charles Cecil\u2026 and many more! \nBut let\u2019s not stick to just personalities. A lot of legendary shows and movies also inspired 3 Minutes to Midnight. We\u2019ll play it safe to avoid spoilers, but if you can fathom The Twilight Zone and Monkey Island having a baby\u2026 that\u2019d be pretty close to 3 Minutes to Midnight.\nWe have many brilliant influences, some of whom were instrumental in shaping our childhoods. They've given us many memories that will stay with us until the end of our days, but how about we make some new ones, too? \nWhat our studio intends to do is bring the point-and-click genre to the next level. At some juncture, adventure games turned to 3D as the next step in their evolution and\u2014while it worked for some of them (like the amazing Grim Fandango)\u2014it was not the case for many, many others that tried that approach.  \nWe\u2019re firm believers of 2D point-and-click adventure games, but what if, besides a breathtaking main plot, we implemented other awesome features like 4K graphics, adaptive soundtracks with seamless transitions, post-processing, backstories for every single character, fluid and gorgeous animations for every action, decisions and consequences that shape the game\u2019s several endings? All of that plus a hint system, the ability to play with keyboard and mouse as well as game controllers, tons of replayability, and a very long list of etceteras. \nOver the past two years, we have received very positive feedback from our community and the press, which keeps us motivated and helps bring us closer to the finish line. Our first game, 3 Minutes to Midnight, will be released in spring/summer 2020. \n\nWhen 3 Minutes to Midnight was but a fever dream almost three years ago, we had a clear vision of what we wanted\u2014and went for it! This is our first game, and our lack of experience made some steps in this arduous process take longer.\nNo matter what, though, we've never lost our forward momentum. We have one clear objective\u2014to create one of the best point-and-click adventure games ever made. It\u2019s no easy task, but our passion and effort are reflected in every little detail. Nothing, no matter how minor, has been neglected. \nA few months ago, while working on secondary plots for our characters, we realized that if we truly wanted to make them justice, we'd need to expand many aspects of the game a considerable amount.\nWe want to do it, but we also know that in order to accomplish such feats, we need your help! We want to work together with our fans to create a new point-and-click game that will occupy a special spot in your heart\u2014just like the great games of old.\n3 Minutes to Midnight will be fully voiced in English. However, the game will feature subtitles in English, German, French, Italian, and Spanish. Later followed by Russian, Portuguese, Czech, Polish, Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Korean, and Japanese translations a few months after release.\nOur aim is to release the game on Windows, Mac, and Linux, and shortly after on Switch, Xbox One, and PS4. There are plans for mobile support for Android and iOS, but this is dependent on stretch goals and will take more time. For now, the game is being released on Steam. There are ongoing talks to bring the game to GOG but at an early stage, so we can\u2019t confirm anything at this point. However, we\u2019d like to have the game available on as many platforms as possible.\nWe know how important it is for our backers to be able to choose a DRM-free version. Therefore, you will be able to choose your preferred platform in a survey we will be sending out after the campaign is over. However, please keep in mind, this campaign is only for the Windows, Mac, and Linux versions.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019ve been self-funded for the past three years, but due to delays and bumps in the road\u2014par for the course when you\u2019re an indie team working on your first big project\u2014we\u2019re going to need an extra push if we don\u2019t want these three years of work going down the drain!

There is a silent, latent war going on, a war able to shatter the foundations of civilization, harnessing ancient knowledge and mystical arts lost for centuries. Get ready to face a long and dangerous journey. \nIt might be the last.  \nThe Hand of Glory is an adventure game inspired by the golden age of point and click, especially by the Broken Sword and Gabriel Knight sagas.\nFind out who kidnapped Elke Mulzberg and unveil a mystery that has its roots in alchemy and esoterism!\nMore than 15 hours of gameplay\nThousands of dialogue lines\nDozens of puzzles to solve   \nControl Lars and Alice and explore Miami and Italy in wonderful 2D Full-HD locations\nOriginal atmospheric soundtrack and full English voice-over  \n We are here on Kickstarter because we need your help to complete work on The Hand of Glory. Even though the game is nearly complete through internally funding, we still have to record voices and add a series of finishing touches that we can't really do without your help! And we\u2019ve prepared a dope series of exclusive rewards that will never be available after this campaign! Here's where the money will go towards: \nPLAY\n\nStop for a second and sail with us on a quick trip.  \n\nYou're on M\u00eal\u00e9e Island and ready to do anything to become a mighty pirate, including sliding on a rope with the help of a rubber chicken with a pulley in the middle.  You're in Lochmarne, Ireland, on the trail of a serial killer disguised as a clown (or emperor penguin, or leprechaun) when you come to grips with the worst of your enemies: a malevolent goat. \nYou're in Rennes-le-Ch\u00e2teau, immersed in the mysteries of the Languedoc, and you run into one of the most intricate puzzle of all time: Le Serpent Rouge.  \nWe can go on, because the challenges you've faced already are endless. But now it's time for you to embark on a completely new journey! \n\n Interact! \nGet ready to fill your pockets with all sorts of crazy stuff!\nSolve puzzles!\nExamine the crime scenes, gather clues, interview witnesses. YOU are in charge of the investigation.\nLearn kinesics!\nAlice observes and provides explanations for people's movements/behaviour to help you understand their motives.\n\nWe want the player to feel completely immersed in the game world, so we\u2019ve chosen locations that are real places where you can actually go. Here is where the adventures of our brave detective will happen! \n\nMiami, Florida \nThe Sun is always shining on Miami!\n\nImposing skyscrapers, sunny beaches, music, golden sand. These and much more constitute the heart and soul of one of the most recognizable cities in the world: Miami, kissed by the sun all year long!  \nBut remember: the brighter the light, the darker the shadow it generates. \nMore than 65 locations to explore!\nSan Leo, Italy \n'Making of'  of the \"San Leo\" location! \n\nThe esoteric side of the tale leads to Italy, and in particular to a medieval town in Emilia Romagna, called San Leo.  \nWe obtained official patronage by the town (of which we\u2019re very proud) and received active and stimulating cooperation, which allowed us to faithfully reproduce many real places rich in history and mystery.  \nPiazza Dante Alighieri in San Leo, Italy\nExplore this fascinating borough and prepare to bring to light secrets buried for centuries under a net of conspiracies, historic machinations and events that normal science can\u2019t explain! \nIn The Hand of Glory you will interact with more than 30 characters! Let's meet some of them!\n Alice Sharp - Making of \nLet's admit it: being able to play an adventure game in your own language is becoming a luxury nowadays. The reasons are many, but we can narrow them to just the main one: budget.  Many developers are forced to stick to English even for subtitles, and this limits the game experience for those who don't know this language fluently.  \nThat's why we decided to make the effort to translate our free demo in as many languages as we could, to offer a glimpse into how it could be to play the game in your language, thanks to the support of the WARLOCS, who will take care of all the text localization of the full game as well. \nThese are the languages we translated the demo in\n We'd really like to translate the game in as many languages as possible, but it's nearly impossible for a new indie team with a limited budget. That's where you come into play: we will produce the game in English (voice and subtitles) and Italian (subtitles) - your support in this campaign will decide the other languages, as explained in the image below. \nNow it's up to you! Spread the word about the campaign in your circle of friends, as we hope that 50 backers is an attainable goal to be able to enjoy a PROFESSIONAL localization in your native tongue! \nYou skipped everything else to get immediately to this section, right? Then now, without further ado, here are the rewards that you can get your hands on by pledging to our Kickstarter campaign! \n Part of the cast: This is your chance to physically enter the world of THOG. Lend your appearance and voice (in your language!) to a character who will be included in the game for Lars to interact with!   \nSponsorship*: You're a developer/company and you want to share some of the 'Glory'? Here's your chance to do just that! Your trailer or a promotional image will be included in a clever way in THOG, for everyone to see it!   \n*We reserve the right to NOT accept content of dubious racist or sexist nature. \nPledging for an add-on is really easy!\nIf you want any add-ons, you just have to add the following amount to the reward you've selected. \n About the \"Mysterious Scroll\"\nAt this point you're probably wondering what this \"Mysterious Scroll\" is that you've been reading about among the rewards. Basically it's going to be a fictitious (but realistic) medieval scroll containing a suggestive, ancient speech.  \n  Please note: this is just a concept!\nThe scroll will also contain a hidden message that will allow you to unlock a secret scene... if you're able to decipher it!\nWe're a small team, but we love what we do and we truly believe point and click adventures still have a lot to give!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProducing a video game is not an easy task: you have to struggle against deadlines, budget balancing, bugs and the development itself.

Heated political turmoil has ignited widespread civil unrest as protests, riots, violence and crime have been building pressure and it is only a matter of time before this powder-keg of a city goes off. The world of Combustion is dark, chaotic and unjust \u2026 but still worth fighting for. \nNorrune features 5 Unique Locations\nThe people, in their repression of their inner nature, struggle to find a means in which to express it. Order, chaos and the nuances in-between. All the while Calico, having shut off his emotions for years, is forced to battle his own demons. \nFrustration, depression and even apathy\nSingle-Player Combat\nArmed with a retractable electric baton and a suppression shield, Calico will confront suspects and criminals in any way he can. With a combat system akin to Brave Fencer Musashi, where blocking, dodging and timing your attacks are critical, Calico will walk a fine line between appropriate force and excessive brutality in his pursuit to restore order.\nAttack & Block\nStun & Snare\nVR Training Missions\nPolice Work\nBeing a policeman is about much more than just busting heads. Calico\u2019s duty is to maintain the law and as such, you'll be heavily incentivized to arrest suspects, perform emergency service work, call in anything suspicious and protect the lives of civilians.\nYou never know who you can trust\nWhen there\u2019s no time, you gotta do things yourself\nLeveling\nStrength, Stamina and Health, Combustion has a streamlined set of stats to keep the pace high and yet give you control over how you prefer to play. Earn experience from all manner of police work, from apprehending suspects to rescuing civilians.\nSet your starting stats\nArrest Suspects for Bonus XP\nCommunication\nEquipped with a cellphone, Calico is in constant contact with his colleagues and associates. They\u2019ll offer guidance and insight and the occasional anecdote, and perhaps can even help Calico with his personal struggles.\nOtacon?!\nExploration\nCombustion rewards exploration, with so many items to use and interact with, NPCs to communicate with and interrogate, and many place to visit. Turn on a TV to watch a broadcast, buy some soda from a vending machine, or find a terrified citizen cowering behind crates. The locations Calico finds himself in keep so much of their secrets in the shadows.\nBuy a soda or watch some TV\nBoxes always hide something good\nCutscenes\nIf there\u2019s one thing the early 3D era in gaming did with such unabashed pride was its cutscenes. Combustion will feature similar camera work, hitting that mark of hubris that the retro era had done so well but with the mindfulness and brevity that Calico\u2019s story deserves.\nStyle and Substance? Now there's a rare mix.\nCinematic Camera\nLike Metal Gear Solid, Parasite Eve and Silent Hill, Combustion features fixed camera angles that automatically bring you back to the late 90s. And while the player-controlled cameras of the 90s were fraught with jank, the fixed cinematic cameras of our favorite games always delivered on enhancing the storytelling. Our camera is carefully utilized to fill each area with distinct emotions: isolation, suspense and despondence.\nCinematic angles set the stage for some great moments.\nUse First-Person View to Check Your Surroundings\nLow-Poly\nCombustion is a retro throwback to the Gen5 consoles of our youth -- The original Playstation, the Nintendo 64 and the Sega Saturn. Featuring a low-poly art-style reminiscent of the early 3D days of gaming, it is in this often unappreciated yet iconic style that the world of Combustion is built. The beauty of low-poly models is in its expressive character designs and simple caricatured worlds. Large polygons and crisp textures are the pixel-art of 3D gaming.\nWay less polygons but still just as atmospheric.\nDieselpunk\nThe technological era in-between steampunk and cyberpunk, Dieselpunk reflects and exaggerates much of our modern era -- Heavy gas-guzzling engines, \u201cHi-tech\u201d CRT monitors and the giant oil rigs dotted across our oceans. Made famous by games like Final Fantasy 7 and Oddworld, this rusty, grimey and all-around industrial design permeates the entirety of the game\u2019s aesthetics.\nI\u2019d buy tickets to this show.\nCharacter must be based on a real-life animal and fit inside the setting of Combustion.

A mysterious invitation to an isolated island results in a grizzly murder and a race against time to track down the killer. Thankfully, in this world that\u2019s not quite like our own, there\u2019s nobody better to crack the case than the great detective and gentleman giraffe, Lord Winklebottom.  \nJoin Lord Winklebottom and his steadfast companion Dr Frumple as they investigate the murder of their old friend. Uncover clues, interview suspects and solve puzzles to crack the case, capture the killer and uncover the horrifying dark secret at the heart of the Isle of Barghest!\nDownload the demo (available on Windows, macOS and Linux) that was playable at Adventure X (with a few tweaks!) to get a taste of the game. This teaser contains unique content that won't appear in the final game, so no need to worry about spoilers! \nAs well as the original English text and voice acting, the demo is now also available with German, Italian, Spanish, Russian and Japanese text translations!\nThe final game will feature improved voice acting, animation and audio, as well as an in-game note system. For now, we recommend writing down notes as you play to help you solve the puzzles. If you need any hints or help, get in touch via #help on our Discord. \nAs well as Steam there will also be a DRM-free release! \nNot to mention the one and only, Tim Schafer!\nLord Winklebottom Investigates is a game set in a version of the 1920s entirely populated by animals. Inspired by the likes of Agatha Christie and Sherlock Holmes, the game is a classic murder mystery with a bizarre twist. \nInvited to the desolate Isle of Barghest by his childhood friend, Admiral Gilfrey, Lord Winklebottom arrives to find that Gilfrey is dead! The family maid, Beryl, made the gruesome discovery while undertaking her daily duties.\nSuspecting foul play and trapped on the island by a storm, Winklebottom must investigate the murder, interrogate the suspects and get to the bottom of the many strange things going on on the island.\nLord Winklebottom Investigates is a point and click adventure game full of perplexing puzzles, witty dialogue and lots of frightfully well-dressed animals.    \nThe game will challenge the player to solve the murder of Lord Winklebottom\u2019s childhood friend, Admiral Gilfrey, in a case that will offer many hours of exploration, investigation, puzzle-solving and interrogation.\nThe game has a streamlined interface that allows you to directly interact with items in the world using simple, context sensitive icons. Just click on an object, and the options available to you will pop up:\nInvestigate! \nLike all good adventure game protagonists, Lord Winklebottom has mysteriously large pockets that allow him to carry around a slightly implausible number of items at any given time. You can interact with stuff in your inventory using the same icon-based interface, and also drag and drop items to combine them or use them on other things in the game.\nInterrogate!\nStick your neck where it\u2019s not wanted and question the other guests and residents of the island to search for potential suspects!\nExplore!\nExplore outside the mansion deep into the island to uncover the strange secrets that reside there.\nThe game will be released on Windows, Mac and Linux in April 2020.\nLord Winklebottom will also be able to join you on your travels! As I am a registered Nintendo Switch developer a Switch version will be released in June 2020 to allow time for additional Nintendo QA processes.\nAny backers that receive the game will have the choice of any of the above platforms! A survey will be sent out after the Kickstarter has ended for you to state your preference. \nBehold a selection of some of the characters you will encounter on your perilous adventure...\nBorn into a wealthy family, the young Lord Winklebottom decided to use his privileged position to help those less fortunate than himself. Now the world\u2019s foremost detective, Lord Winklebottom must solve the grisly murder of his old school friend. \nWinklebottom\u2019s longtime companion and friend, Dr Frumple assists Winklebottom with his cases. While he lacks the deductive skills of the great detective, his detailed knowledge of animal anatomy has often proved invaluable.\nWinklebottom\u2019s childhood friend, Gilfrey joined the navy at a young age and rose quickly through the ranks. Despite being a freshwater animal, Gilfrey loved the sea and in later years went on many private voyages spanning all four corners of the globe. \nRecently promoted, thanks in no small part to the Winklebottom\u2019s assistance in solving the grizzly case of the Limehouse Lizard Murders and bringing the Whitechapel Weasel Gang to justice, Detective Inspector Culver is sent to the island to aid in the investigation.  Attached to the Special Branch.\nThe wife of Admiral Gilfrey, Ethelberta died tragically several years ago. On quiet nights, it is said that you can still hear her melancholy quacking drifting across the island.\nLord Winklebottom Investigates is being developed by Cave Monsters, a 1-person game company based in Sheffield in the UK founded by Charlotte Sutherland.\n \n        I've worked in the games industry as an animator for around a decade, at a variety of companies including Rare, Tt Games, EA and Sumo Digital. This gave me the chance to work on a number of AAA games such as Little Big Planet 3, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed and the LEGO games. \nI've always loved adventure games,the first adventure game I ever played was The Curse of Monkey Island (the puzzle with the map tattoo wins best adventure game puzzle ever in my opinion!) and I\u2019ve been a massive Lucas Arts fan ever since. Grim Fandango also holds a big place in my heart as I have a fairly dark sense of humour and I\u2019ve incorporated my love of it into my personal life\u2026   \nIn 2011 was thrilled to get the chance to work as an animator on the Doctor Who: The Gunpowder Plot for the BBC. Having had this taste of making adventure games, I knew I wanted to make one for my first big solo project. \nI'm a big animal lover and have always been fascinated by both animal biology, anatomy and not forgetting their cuteness!   \nI also love detective stories, particularly ones set in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, such as Sherlock Holmes (The Hound of Baskervilles has been a major influence!), Agatha Christie (And Then There Were None is another major influence!) and the Paul Temple mysteries. \nSo the naturally, this all developed into the idea of a giraffe detective from the 1920s named Lord Winklebottom! \nThe world of Lord Winklebottom is inspired by the detective works of Christie and Conan Doyle, but also draws on the atmosphere and tone of classic horror movies such as the Universal Monsters and Hammer Horror series.\nIn addition, Grim Fandango's combination of a compelling story and incredible atmosphere with great characters and strong humour is a big influence on the game. \nCombining all these elements makes for a unique point and click adventure, filled with humour, mystery and some good old fashioned horror!\nTo show our heartfelt appreciation we are offering a fantastic selection of rewards for all \u2018Winklebackers\u2019...\nA very big thank you! This pack includes access to our backer-only Discord channel, a special backer role on Discord, background wallpapers for both desktop and mobile, as well as your name being in the credits of the game to show our appreciation!\nA copy of Lord Winklebottom Investigates upon release on your choice of Windows, Mac, Linux or Switch!

If you would like to get your hands on one of these items you can do so by selecting \"Manage your pledge\" after backing and adding on the amount listed above. A survey will be sent out to backers after the campaign has ended for you to let me know which add-ons you want. \nThe development cycle for the full game will be around 14 months. I already have a lot of the initial work done, in order to make the prototype demo that you can check out at the top of this page. There\u2019s a lot of content needed to go from that to a full size adventure game, however.\nThe core of the game is its puzzles, so the development process will focus on these first. The plan is to rough out or wireframe the entire game - every location, character and puzzle - to produce a complete playable version of the finished product, but without final art or dialogue. This allows for quick iteration and testing of the puzzles. Once I\u2019m completely happy with this, work will begin on production quality art, and making finishing touches to the final script ready for voice recording.\nI have outlined some key dates below, followed by a pie chart with a revenue split so you can get an idea on where the money is going.\n  After many years working at large companies on AAA titles I have always had a burning passion to work on my own game and have more creative input, which has now lead to me becoming a solo developer working from my home office setup. So far, Lord Winklebottom Investigates has been completely self-funded and developed entirely by me and I\u2019ve dedicated a lot of my own time to the project. To make the game really live up to its promise, and be as amazing as I want it to be, though, I\u2019ll need some extra help, and that's where you come in!\nIt\u2019s really important to me to have the game fully voice acted to a high standard, so part of the money from the Kickstarter will go towards this - actors and studios aren\u2019t cheap, especially for the amount of dialogue in a full-size adventure game. The game really comes alive when the characters have voices, so this is something I\u2019m really keen to get right.\nAs well as recording the dialogue, it also needs translating, so that Lord Winklebottom\u2019s adventures can be enjoyed around the world. While I can't promise specific languages (other than English) at this point, I\u2019ve been in touch with a few localization companies already in order to work out costs. Translating the large amount of dialogue you find in an adventure game isn't cheap, so this is something that would be impossible without Kickstarter.\nI am planning on collaborating with a composer to create a unique, 1920\u2019s inspired soundtrack to really bring the game world to life and make it feel a truly immersive and authentic experience.\nI\u2019ll also need a bit of help with programming - in particular porting to Switch and making sure all the usual Steam goodies, like achievements, are integrated into the game.\nFinally, of course, there\u2019s QA. I\u2019d like to get some of the backers involved in testing the game during development to get feedback and help tweak puzzles, but we\u2019ll also need full QA to make sure there are no nasty bugs in the finished game.\nAll of this of course costs money. This is where you come into the equation and can help build and be a part of the game as a valued contributor!

Speaking of verbs, I do believe that a good script is the one thing that can\u2019t be out of this kind of games, so making you laugh, or at least chuckle, in delight with some clever one-liners, funny interactions and sassy comebacks is going to be one of my main goals.\nThose are just a few of the wackiest Tucana inhabitants.

Adventurers loved the characters, the story, the music\u2026 it left me speechless! \nIt made me really happy to see people asking me for more and more original content every day.

So it will fit perfect into your collection, no worries! \nKeep in mind that the game is only available for digital download no matter which pledge you choose.\nNevertheless we're retro family and we can't really trust that online services will last forever, so if you have opted for a tier of $40.- or more \nthere's an option: you can add a DVD version of SOL705 (full game, DRM Free as always) for only $15.- extra.\nAlso original hand made amigurumi figure of Bobina are now available! So hurry up, there's only a small quantity of them!\nI'm sure most of you are familiar with those stuffed yarn creatures of japanese origin, but just in case, amigurumi is the art of make knitting or crocheting small dolls based upon anime characters or just cute animals.\n And I was lucky enough to be related with one of the most talented amigurumi creator around and she's eager to start knitting those crazy Bobinas for you. Don't be afraid, they won't bite as the real one! Even if you point them with your finger ;)\nAnd for those who love the sweet smell of fresh ink in a glossy piece of paper, three amazing new features! A set of sticky stickers, a postcard of Laguna Tucana in all it's splendor and a gorgeous printed version of the soviet occupation of Tucana way before the Gorbachev era. Signed by me and the team, Mikhail was not in the mood, but still a beauty!\nEverybody loves posters !\nThey are really gorgeous and I'm in love with them. The first one, the comic version, has been drawn a couple of years ago when Sol705 was still more a concept than a real thing. The second one, the anime version as I like to call it, has a lot of influence from one of my favorite japanese series: Genesis Climber Mospeda (aka Robotech the new generation). Can you spot the Lancer on it?\nBoth are fabulous posters with high quality paper and printing!\nHow to proceed?(Please keep in mind that add-ons are only available for tiers of $40.- or higher due to shipping costs).\nChoose the add-on(s) from the list. Go to \u201cmanage your pledge\u201d button on the top of this page. Increase your pledge by $15.- or $20.- depending on your item, and \u201dSave your pledge\u201d without changing the Tier that you originally pledged at.\nAnd after the campaign, we will contact you to ask about the add-on(s) you want and inform you about delivery dates.\nAnd just to make things more interesting, I'll add a free digital copy on all tiers of this rare handbook written by Professor Romaniak during his Tucana days. A real gem. You welcome!\n\nFan of the classics point and click adventures aesthetic? Sol705 features good old 2D art and animation. There\u00b4s no 3D or Spine rig animation involved whatsoever, just hand-drawn pictures along with that beautiful myriad of animated pixels we love to see our characters move, which feels -and looks- just great!\nHere you have a sneak peak of some background illustrations for\nTucana\u00b4s Lake, the little town where everything can be possible...\nOne of the funniest things in point and clicks is the possibility of use and combine all the stuff you\u2019ll be picking up and carrying on along the journey, and this is not going to be the exception! Very much on the contrary, I am sure that many of the objects to be used in the game will bring incredible fond memories to some of you and will awake curiosity and disbelief in those who have never seen before...! Those are a few ones from the dozens you'll find around.\nBut what about the beats, you may wonder? The OST includes great songs from the south american under scene, which is one of the main themes of this adventure. Two tracks are composed by a personal favourite: the Hiroshima Dandys. Other bands are also working to bring us some amazing songs, going from techno pop to symphonic rock!\nIn addition I have three fantastic musicians providing both the main theme and the incidental music.. \nOther talented musicians who had collaborated with me are Eric Matyas, Chris Whickham and Christian Laszlo. \nAnd more great news: new bands are set for the next release, as NAX from my own cousin Nicol\u00e1s Castello!\nBut anyways, back to the point: all these are some of the reasons why I need funds to bring this game to the next level. After proving the community and myself that I'm fully capable of this, my next step is to ask for some real bucks to be able to give everything I have to make everything I have planned for Sol705 a reality.\nGraphic adventures are the best thing in the world but also pretty hard to make; there's a lot of stuff to do: illustrations to draw, animations to make, dialogues to write and translate into several languages, music to compose... not to mention programming and keep chasing nasty bugs during countless nights!\nI\u2019ve been working on this project for several months and I\u2019ve finished around a 60% of the final adventure. Anyhow, I can cover for most of the game expenses. The KS donations are for extra things like translations (english is not my native language) animations and voice acting. My living costs are already covered and I work at home...well...actually on a cave not so far from it, so rest assure on that one!\nI started programming as a hobby back in the '90s for the Sinclair Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amiga 500. One of my early games was pirated even before finished...and I ended up buying it without knowing! Even though, those were really great times and with Sol705 I wanted to bring back those feelings of joy and madness after spending several years into game press journalism. \nThat is why I'm developing this adventure, powered by two steaming coffee pots, running full time, under very dim lights and with tons of coding dumps surrounding me. But this time I'm not alone!\nI decided to team-up with the same amazing artists, animators, translators, voice actors and musicians that worked with me in the demo (and some new others) to improve over the quality of this and take my ideas to the next level! And the best thing is that I don't need to make everything from scratch to get the game ready as I'm using a revolutionary Bladecoder engine by Rafael Garc\u00eda that it's like a dream come true! \nOn the artistic side I count with the talent of Himashis Karmakar an out of this world artist working on the backgrounds on double shift! Some of their art can be appreciated below, you'll love it!Translations will be are assured by the best professionals into the localisation arts: Christophe Pallar\u00e8s @xtooph for the french version, Alexander Preymak  @preymak from the russian kosmonautic center, and Michael Stein @atneon at the german frontier. \nYou can always be in touch with me at:\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n Even if the game is going to be ready for download on March 2019, I got more great news for you: most rewards will become available for download starting on June 2018!

I'm always looking for a new well made adventure game to play, and among the many games I've played this is definitely one of the best.

As private investigator Howard Lotor, you are set to solve detective cases, interrogate witnesses, explore the intriguing and dangerous world around you, and sneak your way to safety using smell-based stealth mechanics. \nBackbone combines the visual and social contrasts of film noir with anthropomorphic animals, retrofuturistic technologies, and dystopian fiction. Crawl through the dark alleys of pixelated Vancouver, and experience the impactful storyline focused on themes of power and prejudice.\nYou can now add awesome rewards to any tier! How do add-ons work?\n1. Press \"Manage your pledge\" button if you have chosen a tier already. If not, choose it first.\n2. Increase your pledge by the amount of price of add-ons you want to order. When the Kickstarter campaign is over, you will receive a survey and assign this extra amount to add-ons.\nA rich, living and breathing world waiting to be explored. Backbone takes place in dystopian Vancouver, BC, featuring real locations and breathtaking pixel landscapes.\nStroll through the rainy streets reciting your favorite film noir quotes\nA stylistic and thematic fusion of film noir, anthropomorphic animals, retrofuturism and dystopian classics. The world of Backbone is something you\u2019ve never seen before but always wished you had. \nGet under the pelt of Howard Lotor - a raccoon private investigator\nChallenging, thought-provoking storyline featuring themes of power, corruption, social decay and systemic discrimination. Backbone tells a tale about how our environment shapes us, and how we influence it in return.\nTo be released in 2019 with your support!\nDetective work. Collect evidence, interrogate witnesses, connect the dots and follow leads on your own. No hand-holding - move forward through the game by your own rules. Every case has numerous trails, and it\u2019s up to you to decide which one to follow.\nSniff out the evidence and follow the trail\nStealth & Action. In the animal world, smell is the most powerful sense. Hide in multi-level environments, mask your scent in garbage bins, follow suspects and escape the chase. \nBut remember that you smell too\nSpecial abilities. The Artifact is a unique ancient technology with unknown origins and purpose. If you learn how to use it, it might change the regular order or destroy it.\nRaccoon with a bear claw? Sure.\nThe planet is sprawling with anthropomorphic animal species. The streets of Vancouver are overgrown with ivy and humongous trees, branches and vines piercing through the concrete, and huge flowers nesting on top of the roofs. \nDystopian Vancouver is a hauntingly beautiful place\nThe Great Apes call themselves the founding fathers of this world, and they are the moral, ethical and political compass of society. Citizens are divided into informal classes according to their species. The political and underground power is corrupted, and the glass ceiling seems impossible to break.\nEveryone is in the right place beneath The Great Apes\nVancouver is surrounded by high walls from every side to make sure that no one from across it intrudes. It is strictly forbidden to cross the wall, and the only thing waiting outside is savage hostile creatures. \nSmugglers are the only ones brave enough to cross, bringing back unknown technologies to break and trade\nHoward Lotor is a raccoon and a private investigator who doesn't feel like he belongs. His mundane life is interrupted with the appearance of a powerful technology that can blur the lines of conventional order and change society forever.\n- Hello, detective Howard. I have a case for you\nBackbone's visual style is a modern take on the classical retro adventure look. While conceptualizing the world of Backbone, we knew we wanted to take the best parts of our favorite city and combine it with hi-res pixel art. \nIt all starts with the sketch\nVancouver is one of the most beautiful and noir cities in the world, and we knew right away what streets, landmarks and favorite spots to include in the game. Vancouver finally plays itself!\nIconic Vancouver locations (and Roxy Burger) play important role in Backbone\nEvery character and environment element is animated frame by frame. It is a tedious process, but creating life and charisma out of a collection of pixels is magic we wouldn't trade for anything else.\nEvolution of Howard Lotor's walk cycle\nCombining pixel art with 3D effects in UE4 like multi-layered backgrounds, parallaxing, dynamic lighting and lens flares adds to the cinematic feeling of the game. Sprawling city, contrasting silhouettes against the setting sun, dust particles, neon signs and steaming sewer hatches enhance the noir atmosphere of the city.\nSetting up light sources on the 3D scene with pixel art sprites\nAn important element of noir Vancouver is the music coming from jazz bars, noisy alleys, night fish markets and industrial blocks. Backbone\u2019s composer Nikita Danshin is combining jazz and electronic music to create a viscous soundtrack that feels like a dark, enveloping veil of bebop and cinematic soundscapes. \nBackbone will release on Windows, Mac and Linux in Q2 2019. Platform releases are going to be announced if this campaign reaches the stretch goals.\nEggNut is a game development studio from Vancouver, Canada. We got together in 2016 and decided to start making video games.

We started producing content for the trailer in January 2018, and we'll reuse every asset that we created in the actual game. Right now everything is ready for production: the game structure and scope, story and plot outlines, character arcs, world building, level design, and production schedules. All that remains is to get the team working full-time, to release Backbone without wasting any time on other projects.\nWe developed a Backbone demo level with storyline and core mechanics: walking, running, crawling, stealth, smell, dialog, inventory, and action. We want to polish it with the assets we prepared during our proof of concept stage, and publish for all backers this Summer.\nKickstarter Budget Distribution\nSo far, we have been creating Backbone using our personal income and free evenings and weekends from our full-time jobs. We love the full creative control indie development brings, and we don't want to depend on side companies to dictate our vision. We know that we have all the resources and skills to finish the game and publish it successfully. The only thing lacking is financial support and thus the ability to get the whole team working full-time, and porting costs for Switch, PS4 and Xbox One. To stay independent we need your support! \nKickstarter is also an amazing platform to attract passionate community. Backbone is all about social context, so the more feedback we get from people with various experiences, the better. Backers with tier The Sniffer and higher are invited to participate in closed beta testing and communicate their vision in our Backer-only Discord server. Let's build this game together!\n                                            ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEggNut team has extensive experience in IT, art and music industries, but this is our first video game. Game development is a very tricky thing - you never know if you made a good game until thousands of different people actually play it. Before launching this project, we spent a year in pre-production, exploring creative and business sides of game development and discovering ways we could make this work with minimal risks. We are confident in our creative power, teamwork, project management and production strategies, and we want to be as transparent as possible about our processes.\n\nThese are the main things we're doing to minimize risks:\n\u30fbWe are a small team of 6 people working remotely (no rental costs) with inexpensive technologies and low cost marketing plan.\n\u30fbWe are committed to result and have an established way of working together as a team.\n\u30fbOur goal is to ship the highest quality product possible without stretching it horizontally with new features, but rather perfect the existing and most necessary ones.\n\u30fbWe have a designated project manager, which is rare for an indie team. We build roadmaps, deadlines, track every step of the progress and evaluate everything before making decisions. This thorough planning helps to imagine every possible scenario and adapt on-the-go. \n\u30fbPre-production went on for a year, and we're ready to enter production stage with all our assets being reusable.

It's full of various characters that you can interact with and mini-games that you'll need to solve in order to pass through 25 hand-painted levels.\nKickstarter trailer in a 1080p / 60fps format:\nA \"Making of\" video showing the creative process behind our game:\nBeautiful Art Style:\n25 carefully hand-painted environment levels of post-apocalyptic Japan\nDiverse Characters:\nYou will meet diverse characters throughout your journey. Some of them will be friendly and some of them hostile. You will have to interact with them in order to pass through each level.\nFun Mini-Games:\nOur game will include over 30 hand-painted and detailed mini-games that will require logic and wits to solve them.\nFor Players of All Ages:\nThis game is suitable for adults and for younger players just as well.\nIn a not so distant future when humanity reaches its tipping point developing various technologies, they also deplete most of the earth\u2019s resources. A great war follows and wipes out all humans around the globe. After hundreds of years of radiation fallout, humanoid animals and robots emerge onto the earth\u2019s surface. \nIn the land that was once known as Japan, lives a small robot called Delta. He and his father, a well-known scientist, both live peacefully on the outskirts of a large desert. But one day, Delta\u2019s father suddenly disappears. Delta has no choice, but to go out there into the wilderness and bring his father back home.\nWe will have over 30 various characters that will play a huge part in the game\u2019s storyline. We have robots that now live similar lives like humans used to do before the great war. They take care of themselves and try to survive in the wasteland. We then have humanoid animals that mutated into large creatures. They rule over robots and treat them as their slaves.\nDELTA\nDELTA'S FATHER\nLV422\nTRADER\nBUTHAN COW\nDRIFTER\nJUNKYARD SPIDER\nCHEMIST\nPOLICE OFFICERS\nEB-210\nSOLDIERS\nBIG CITY THUGS\nPOTION MAKER\nYou will experience an extraordinary journey through an expansive world that includes 25 beautifully hand-painted levels. You will travel through a desert wasteland, metal junkyard, cyberpunk styled locations, various Japanese interiors, post-apocalyptic Japanese suburbs, a secret army base and many more.\nLevel 03 - Drifter's Ship\nLevel 06 - Chemist\nLevel 11 - Police Office\nLevel 13 - Water Hut\nLevel 21 - Army Tent\nLevel 23 - Army Factory\nEach of our environment levels consists of a large number of separate layers. We build them together in Unity and create an immersive parallax effect that helps us to tell the story the way we want it.\nParallax effect example in level 13\n\u201cLife of Delta\u201d game will consist of over 30 hand-painted and detailed mini-games. These mini-games will be part of almost every level and Delta will need to pass each one of them in order to proceed to the next level or the next item.\nSome mini-game examples:\nLevel 01: Delta wakes up from his slumber, confused what has happened to him. He realizes his batteries are completely depleted. He needs to recharge and in order to do that, he needs to find the right combination of each symbol inside the orange triangle. With each correct combination, his battery will charge a bit. Once the battery is fully charged, Delta can run into the wide world and embark on his journey.\nThe charger puzzle in level 01\nLevel 03: Delta needs to repair the Drifter\u2019s old ship by retrieving some old missing parts. One of the missing parts will be a computer chip inside an old robot\u2019s head. Your job is to short-circuit cables on a motherboard in the right order and take the computer chip out without damaging it.\nThe computer chip puzzle in level 03\nLevel 14: Delta will need to get an item from the kitchen cellar. In order to do that he needs to hack the cellar door\u2019s lock and retrieve its password.\nThe cellar door puzzle in level 14\nWe managed to get Shaun Rylands onboard, who is a brilliant composer. His love for 80\u2019s cyberpunk music added something really special to our project. \"Life of Delta - Original Soundtrack\" will consist of over 15 tracks.\nYou can find more of his work here: https://soundcloud.com/rylo-3\n TIER 1 - THANK YOU\n- Access to developer updates\n- Two high-resolution 4K \u201cLife of Delta\u201d digital wallpapers\n- High-resolution CMYK and ready to print A2 posters of 6 different environment levels\nTIER 2 - THE GAME\n- Access to developer updates.\n- Two high-resolution 4K \u201cLife of Delta\u201d digital wallpapers.\n- High-resolution CMYK and ready to print A2 posters of 6 different environment levels.\n- Digital copy of \u201cLife of Delta\u201d with a 20% discount of the final retail value for either Windows or Mac.\n- Your name in the credits.\nTIER 2 - EARLY ACCESS\n- Access to developer updates.\n- Two high-resolution 4K \u201cLife of Delta\u201d digital wallpapers.\n- High-resolution CMYK and ready to print A2 posters of 6 different environment levels.\n- Digital copy of \u201cLife of Delta\u201d with a 20% discount of the final retail value for either Windows or Mac.\n- Your name in the credits.\n- Receive the game 7 days before the official release.\nTIER 3 - ART BOOK\n- Access to developer updates.\n- Two high-resolution 4K \u201cLife of Delta\u201d digital wallpapers.\n- High-resolution CMYK and ready to print A2 posters of 6 different environment levels.\n- Digital copy of \u201cLife of Delta\u201d with a 20% discount of the final retail value for either Windows or Mac.\n- Your name in the credits.\n- Digital version of \"Life of Delta\" artbook.

The endless oceans of this world hide in their depths an enigmatic metropolis without people, an ancient city which at its heart keeps a terrible secret \u2013 a secret which will turn your perception of this story on its head. The dark finale will pit the player against a bizarre and unfathomable force, an eerie presence which lurked in the dark the entire time.\nK'NOSSOS Prologue, Screenshot\nK\u2019NOSSOS is a project which is very close to the hearts of the team who are working on its development. The seed funding for the game has not come from any investors or publishers, but out of the dedication and hard work of all the people involved with Svarun Entertainment group. We have got to the stage where to fully realize our dream we need a level of funding to assist us, in delivering the game which we can clearly see through the prism of our mind\u2019s eye.\nTo share our vision with you, our backers and future players, we have prepared a fully completed Prologue of the final game in English which you are free to download via this direct link. The release trailer for the Prologue is available on YouTube.\nYou may download K'NOSSOS Press Kit via following link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9YkFAaql848WGhBTG96R0dVU3M\nK'NOSSOS Trailer may be downloaded from following link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9YkFAaql848S21mX0t5TEtKOEU\nFollowing the trajectory set by navigators at its port of origin, a huge interstellar colonization ship has approached the outer reaches of a vast debris cloud set at the outskirts of an unknown solar system. With maneuverability impeded by its construction and dimensions, the ship relied on the reinforced hull to take the brunt of the impact. This confidence was ill-placed, however, and the structural integrity of the vessel has been severely compromised. \nYou take up a role of the lone passenger aboard who has been awakened from cryo-sleep to address the damage. Following the repairs made across the vast interior of the vessel, the passenger learns that it was almost in vain as the collision with the asteroid has rendered the vital power systems all but useless. \nK'NOSSOS Prologue, Screenshot\nBy directing the ship\u2019s long-range scanners towards the star of the system, the man succeeds in locating a faint power signature radiating from the surface of the second planet from the sun. With hopes of finding the replacement power cores on a distant and unknown world, the lone passenger directs the vessel towards the star and returns to cryo sleep once again. Seventeen years later, the giant spacecraft approaches the dying star.\nProtagonist of K\u2019NOSSOS is a lonely man gliding through the infinite darkness of the vast cosmos, destined for either glory or disaster as he mans the automated Extrasolar Long-Reach Exploration and Colonization Vessel #074 searching for an inhabitable planet as means of aleviating their homeworld\u2019s population crisis. Who exactly is this man? What is the city we see him in during the short episode portraying his seemingly idyllic family life? What was his motivation for applying for a mission which would prevent him from seeing his loved ones ever again? As much as the game world itself, the protagonist himself is a mystery, an enigma hard on the surface, reluctant to give away its secrets easily...  \nA distinguishing feature of K\u2019NOSSOS is the utility Orb that hovers along as player character explores the game world. The Orb is a non-sentient and silent companion providing four functions for the player to use while solving problems: heating things up, melting metals and other materials, cutting anything that can be cut, and finally welding two or several items together into a single object. As pretty much anything in our story, the simple Orb is not at all what it seems and it is up to the player to reveal the true nature of this advanced handyman\u2019s fantasy.\nIn its essence K\u2019NOSSOS is a progeny of ideas expressed during the golden age of adventure game genre, with gameplay reminiscent of such classic point-and-click titles as Beneath the Steel Sky, Chronomaster, Primordia and The Dig. The game puts equal emphasis on characterization, atmosphere and storytelling on the one hand, and problem solving and challenging puzzles on the other.\nWe took great care to make sure our puzzles are seamlessly integrated into the narrative as to avoid the sense of artificial barriers put up solely to hamper the player\u2019s progress. Most of all, we aim at building an aura of uneasiness and low-intensity dread that comes from being stranded in an alien place without being sure exactly what to do or how to digest all the weird sights and sounds that surround you. The art direction we have chosen is designed to fulfil that very purpose. \nK'NOSSOS Prologue, Screenshot\nMechanics-wise K'NOSSOS plays like most of the classic games of the genre. PC, viewed from 3rd person, traverses the locations presented in side-view. \nUsing a classic third person interface, the player is able to interact with the world through a player character (PC) avatar. Left mouse click is used for moving and interacting with devices, objects and characters and the right mouse click is used for examining anything in the game world further.\nK'NOSSOS, Screenshot\nTo make progress on his/her quest, the player will operate numerous devices collect usable items and apply them on objects in game world or inventory scour the vast locales of spaceships, orbital platforms, surface structures and the titular city submerged in planetary ocean engage in dialogue with machines and living creatures as well as solve diverse puzzles whose difficulty ranges from simple to challenging - but fair!\nEven though we mostly work online we try to meet up as often as possible and keep those creative juices flowing in real life as well. This is how it was during one of our serious meetings held in Weatherspoon's in Manchester:\nNikola and Jonathan discussing serious indie adventure game stuff over a pint\nFirst of all, a big \"THANK YOU!\" to all the guys in game journalism and press - without you, us indies would be like a whale stranded on a beach. That said, check out some of the impressions K'NOSSOS Prologue left on people who tried it out and wrote about it...\nPlease take a look at the rewards and options we offer below.\nWe are confident that there is something for everyone there.\nOur main goal for making our dream possible is 8000 GBP. But this is not the end. We have a lot of ideas how to improve K'NOSSOS to deliver a much deeper experience. We would love to do more graphical improvements, full voice over, add more languages, additional platforms and much, much more.\nAs to how exactly we would spend the funds entrusted by you, here is a graphical breakdown of the allocation of funds:\nAllocation of Funds", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere is a well-known saying in the world of software development, and that is: \u201cAnything is possible, if you have enough time and enough money.\u201d People usually focus on the first part of the statement and forget the second, but that\u2019s where all the problems sit.\n\nOur project faces the same challenges, and investors suffer from the same risks as pretty much every software project on Kickstarter, and that is the translation from our dream to the reality of a software delivery which you, the player, can enjoy. In truth, we consider ourselves to be in a very strong position to mitigate these risks due to the following factors.\n\nCollectively we have many years of experience in delivering complex software products and other related assets to significant commercial customers. Through our rigorous planning and fanatical devotion to the avoidance of scope creep we have managed to flesh out a secure development path, and thus a very firm framework surrounding those things we can control.\n\nHowever, there is certainly a question of how are we going to respond to those things we cannot control. The first thing to state is that we have deliberately structured our project in such a fashion as to minimize the impact of events we cannot control. This approach has been born out of necessity, as the seed funding for the project has come from the individual team members who have been working on a pro-bono basis. This means that, irrespective of almost any event, we are confident that we have full capacity to pull the project back on track relying solely on the strengths and assets we possess in house at all times.\n\nWhat happens after the project has been funded, provided that it does of course? Are we going to fall into the trap and allow our ambitions to soar so that we end up harboring the thought of releasing a title with AAA production values? As creative, but serious and realistic people, we are well aware that this would lead us into a downward spiral and in the end bring the whole project to ruin. We have great ideas for many more games to come \u2013 we wish to fund and finish K\u2019NOSSOS, release it for the world to enjoy and then move on to our next project, another instance of fruitful collaboration between us, the developers, and you, our wonderful players.\n\nAs far as our stretch goals are concerned, in case we do get sufficient funding to carry any of those out, then each of these goals is closely costed and risk assessed and will not impact adversely on the production schedule.\n\nTo conclude, so far we have put absolute faith into the commitment of the principals to seeing the project completed, and for this very reason we have something to show for it a bit over a year since we\u2019ve started our work. Funding will make the dev process easier for us and will bring us to the finish line much earlier than it would happen should we rely on our private resources alone. Challenges are and will be numerous and we will gladly tackle them; risks \u2013 we will approach with caution but in the end emerge victorious. We see the backing you provide as material manifestation of trust put into our effort and it would take hell freezing over before we put any of that in jeopardy.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "A Face in the Crowd", "descp": "You were one of the many waving the interstellar spacecraft farewell as it left the port.

We know that not everyone has friends all in one place, though, which is why online multiplayer is one of our stretch goals.\nLocalisation - We plan to support English, French, Italian, German and Spanish on release. We'd love to support more languages, which is why additional localisation is a stretch goal!\nFuture Updates - We've got a handful of free major updates planned for Brief Battles post-launch to expand on the experience! We'll be bringing more undies, regions, modes and mayhem!

They'll provide undies for sure! Orange presents may give you undies, but can also wreak havoc by freezing you, trapping you inside, or other nasty things. Only grab them if you're desperate.

In this sci-fi series, the Cubes are a mysterious and advanced technology created by the Anterran people, an alien civilization who disappeared long ago. The cubes interact with mankind at different moments of its history, offering new powers and technologies. But their true purpose still remains unknown...\nMYHA, in its first Original Edition, was a free First Person Adventure game in 2d (prerendered 3d) composed of 360\u00b0 cylindrical panoramic views, created in 10 days by Simon Mesnard during the Myst Game Jam of January 2016, on itch.io.\nIncluding never-before-seen new content, RealMYHA is the Full 3D remake of MYHA, entirely recreated with Denis Martin, the author behind RoonSehv!\nDenis and Simon have worked together to recreate the island of the original game with Unreal Engine 4. New puzzles and ideas make the game longer and more impressive. You'll have to explore the island, look for clues and take notes to solve the secrets of this world.\nRealMYHA will be localized into English (text and voice) and French (text only). We'd like to add more languages (text) through the stretch goals in case of success with this campaign, so we need your help!\n UPDATES\n    Click to learn more about RHEM\n             DISCOVER...\n          \"Myha will make you work hard for your progress. Clues come in a range of forms \u2013 letters, symbols, colours, numbers \u2013 and a variety of different sources, and even after finding all the related clues you\u2019ll need to seriously ponder their connections to proceed.\" \u2013 Adventure Gamers\n  Day/Night cycles\n  Interactive computer with diary, menus, options...\n  Challenging puzzles. Sit down, relax, and think...!\n  Some of the original puzzles will be updated\n  MYHA Original version features:\nVisit the mysterious island of Myha to solve the puzzles and progress in the game\n~1 hour of game time\nAnimated opening and ending movies\nReminiscent of MYST (created during Myst Jam 2016)\nRealMYHA Remake features:\nThe world of Myha entirely recreated in Unreal Engine 4!\nMore realistic graphics, new textures, dynamic lighting, day/night cycles...\nOriginal puzzles updated + all new puzzles\nIncreased game time\nA new original soundtrack composed for the occasion by Olivier Maurey (RoonSehv)\nPC release, DRM-free\nThe CSE (planet Terra's Space agency) received a distress signal from the moon. A cosmonaut is sent into space to investigate. When he arrives at the destination, there is no distress beacon, there is no-one around, except for a mysterious Black Cube. He takes it and... is suddenly teleported in a faraway world: an island, on a moon named Myha.\n Why a remake?\nOur first purpose is to expand the story and the universe of the original game. Now that we have plenty of time to develop the game, we'd like to tell more about the different ruins that you will see, which were created at different times. We're also thinking of including a side quest: the island has been a harbor for a crew of pirates at some point, and one of your quests would be to discover their hidden treasure...\nThe colors and textures will be improved, the resolution will be in HD while the original game was stuck in 1024x576 with an old-school style reminiscent of Myst (years 1990s)! We plan to add new animations and various details that will make the final game more lively.\nThe gameplay will benefit of many improvements, allowing to move in all directions and rotate the camera freely. We leave the old-school Myst-like style for a more modern approach and, from what we tested so far in our prototype, we must say that it's really thrilling!\n  Why Unreal Engine 4?\nThe use of UE4 was obvious and natural for us. This engine is indie-friendly: it allows to create great looking games with a small team and for free. Denis was already skilled with UDK, thanks to the development of his previous game RoonSehv. Unreal has another advantage: the blueprint (nodal programming) allows to create everything without using a single line of code.\nUE4 has a lot of convenient tools to paint textures, terrains, place assets and add wind in the vegetation. It really makes a huge difference in terms of quality in all the games nowaday: the market and the technology have evolved a lot, and players are now asking for more immersive games, more freedom and full HD graphics, even on the indie scene. It's time for the Black Cube series to evolve and show you its exotic worlds in a more impressive way. We're working hard on it, but of course, we also want to keep the heart of the series for the fans: its challenging puzzles will remain!\nEvolution of Myha. At the top, early designs from the original game. Then the new designs for RealMYHA.\n Before/After\n  Development\nThe development of RealMYHA started in autumn-winter 2016, and a short demo was released in december of the same year during the BlackCube Jam on GameJolt (try it here).\nThe project was initiated with a watercolor sketch, which gave the main direction for the colors, environment and, more globally, a kind of poetic atmosphere due to the presence of the sea, a peaceful nature and old ruins.\nHere's also a concept art by artist Simon Demaret:\nThen the real thing started with Blender and Unreal. These tools are used for 3d-modeling, texturing and making the game itself. Denis has put a lot of efforts on improving the island, such as the cliffs and rocks, compared to the original game. He somehow reproduced a little bit of his own country, Normandy! (Have you heard of Etretat cliffs?)\nMusic and sound design:\nA 3D world would be nothing without a convincing soundtrack. Among all adventure games released in 2013, ASA was nominated as one of the 5 best games in the category 'Best Sound Effects' for the Aggies rewards on Adventure Gamers, so we'd like to create a nice ambiance in RealMYHA too. It's important to be able to hear the sound of the sea, birds (...) and feel your loneliness in the darkest cave.\nIn the original version of Myha, the soundtrack was composed of free royalty-free tracks, mainly because of the limit of time during the game jam. However for this remake, our purpose is to include an all new soundtrack that will fit perfectly the new graphics. We already know the ideal music composer, Olivier Maurey (RoonSehv), and he has logically joined our team.\n  Why Kickstarter?\nWe have made significant progress in the development of RealMyha. A large part of the game already exists and can be played.\nHowever, we need your help. Our purpose is to exceed our usual limits! Making a game - even indie - requires a huge amount of resources, energy and time. In RealMYHA, we want to improve the graphics furthermore, bring new ideas, improve the puzzles and make the game longer. What you can see in the attached videos and screenshots is a work in progress, but we know that we can do a lot better. The idea of the Kickstarter is to bring a helping hand and make the game not just good, but great!\n  Simon Mesnard\nSimon Mesnard lives in Burgundy (France), he started making CG graphics with 3dsmax at the age of 15. He finished his bachelor in sciences and got a degree in graphic design (school PoleIIID, Lille, France). He worked for several years as a general graphic designer, then lead renderer. Later he started a solo career and became a freelancer with the will to develop his own projects. Things really started to become serious with the release of his short film 2011: A Space Adventure (Vimeo Staff Pick), which gave birth to the Black Cube series, including among others his games ASA and Catyph, the comics Anterran, and soon realMYHA.\nDenis Martin\nDenis Martin is a self-taught developer who works on indie games at home during his free time, in Normandy (France). Even if making games is not his main job, it doesn't prevent him from being serious and skilled: simply try his first game RoonSehv, and you will discover a very unique world. In order to make RoonSehv, he gathered and managed a team of creative artists now known as Babel Studio, and he brought the ideas and main designs. Denis uses Blender very well, and his favorite game engine is Unreal. It is naturally the tool we chose to give life to realMYHA.\nOlivier Maurey\nOlivier Maurey (France) is a music composer, and he's a huge fan of Myst. As he tells himself: \"I have been passionate since the very first episode of the Myst and Uru series\". And that's something you can feel in his creations. Listen (and play!) to his previous works on his official website, l'Age des Sons, where you can even find a free online puzzle game. His music album for RoonSehv was very good too, and we have no doubt that Olivier will create something wonderful for RealMYHA.\nRelated links\nThe Black Cube series\nOfficial site: theblackcube.fr\nFacebook page: facebook.com/blackcube.series\nMyha and RealMYHA: theblackcube.fr/myha\nSimon Mesnard\nPortfolio: simonmesnard.fr\nTwitter: @Simon_ASA\nDenis Martin\nBlog: roonsehv.blogspot.fr\nTwitter: @prom361\nOlivier Maurey\nWebsite: age-des-sons.com\nThe Icehouse collective\nOfficial site: theicehouse.fr\nFacebook page: facebook.com/theicehousecollective\nTwitter: @theicehouse_col\n Shipping\nSimon and Denis both live in France and all physical rewards will be shipped from this country.

With a leveling system of over 40 skills and multiple modes, from Rogue-like to Arena, it's up to the players how they build their Ninja Cat and what adventure they will follow. Fear not the rogue-like though; the character progress is not lost, since the skills that are unlocked transfer to each new character, making the player's cat stronger in every playthrough. Still you don't like rogue-like? We got you covered, with the Pussycat mode you can play the game with checkpoints in every level, in a classic linear adventure. This will not make it much easier though, fast reflexes and a keen eye are required in order to survive the journey to free your Master. You don't have to take this journey alone though; you can have a group of up to four people in local co-op!\n Before Valve closed down Greenlight, they decided to pass few games through the process manually. and Claws of Furry was one of them! If Valve trust us, you should too!\nCat Lee approves.\nClick to download!\n  Story in Claws of Furry follows the old-school arcade path, meaning that less is more. The narrative will have linear progression, with cut scenes that will progress the story, but fear not; the game will focus more on what you really want: punching things.\nYour Ninja Master was abducted before your eyes! Pursue his tracks through the territories of your sworn enemies and free him from captivity! Be vigilant though; not everything is what it seems...\nYour \"base\" in the game, the Dojo.\n  Overview\n\nClaws of Furry is a blend of the old and the new; the actual fighting mechanics are reminiscent of arcade beat'em up games but your Ninja Cat's fighting style is fully customizable, with over 40 skills to unlock and upgrade. You want to attack fast and be agile, sacrificing damage? Or you want to be slow and hit hard? One thing is certain, in time you will be able to do both. But it will take lots of characters to sacrifice in order to become that powerful. Speaking of sacrifice...\nNote to self: Use Double Jump.\nThe game's main mode has rogue-like elements, meaning that once your character dies, you won't see him again. But fear not, all the experience your character has gathered will travel with his Ninja Soul to another cat. The new cat will have to start the journey all over again, this time more powerful than before. Your enemies will grow with you however, and they might be a bit more prepared this time around, so why not bring some friends to help?\nNinja Souls Concept Art\nThe game will feature up to 4 players in local co-op! The Kickstarter trailer ( that you probably already watched ) is from the Alpha version of the game. In addition to the two environments you see, there will be another two, and in case you noticed the lack of dogs in the trailer, we assure you that more sworn cat enemies await you. Including man's best friend.\nDogs, those overfrienly and loyal vile creatures, await you.\nMovement\nYour character is a cat, and also a Ninja. We want to pass this through the gameplay by making movement very fast, and also try and give the agility and responsiveness a cat ninja would have. In short, we give you the means to get yourself out of a tight spot.\nUnrestricted and fast dodging to avoid any damage, it may seem op, but trust me you need it.\n  You can bounce off many enemies, giving you the opportunity to create openings when in high ground.\nAttacks\nAgain, you are a ninja cat. Fast paced and always on the move is your bread and butter. We give you an arsenal of moves to use and upgrade depending on what playstyle you prefer. From quick attacks and an emphasis on avoiding danger, to strong attacks that leave you open for damage if you're careless.\nYour basic Fast Attack, low damage with minimal knockback, but can be used while moving.\n  Your basic Strong Attack, high damage with high knockback, but slower and cannot be used while moving.\n  Skills! You will have a ton of those. This particular one is called \"Quake\".\n  Directional Attacks! Chain your attacks in combos!\n  Your basic Ranged Attack. When not upgraded, it does very minimal damage, but it has a very high knockback. Works great when you want to create space between you and your enemies or when you want to throw an enemy on a hazard.\nChapters\nAt the moment, we have four chapters planned. Each chapter has its own thematic environments, enemies and bosses. The Slums has Rats, the Sewers has Crocodiles, the Dog City has Dogs (duh) and the last is a surprise that we really can't spoil.\n\nModes\nWe currently have three modes planned.\n\n\u2022  Pussycat\nFor those who simply don't have the patience and taste for permadeath or for those who want to practice before moving on to \"Normal\" mode. Progress is saved after every level.\n\n\u2022 Normal\nRogue-like progression with randomized level pool and no checkpoints.\nCharacter progress, skills and costumes are saved, but not level progress.\n\n\u2022 Survival Arena\nWe throw you into an arena, and you must survive wave after wave. How long can you last?\nBosses are the last obstacle for you before you can progress any further. While we'd love to keep them all a surprise, we'll show you three bosses that you'll encounter. If you don't want to spoil it for yourself, simply close your eyes and scroll the mouse wheel down maniacally. More bosses will come with more chapters (see stretch goals) but for now we only have the resources for 4 chapters.\nWe know \"Eye of the Dog\" is a terrible catch-phrase.\n  After performing certain tasks and achievements, you will unlock costumes which they will give your cat special properties and even special moves. All the unlocked costumes, no matter in which mode you unlock them, will be available to your locker in your base, the \"Dojo\".\nThe CATPOOL costume. It gives the player regenerating and increased health. You are not immortal though (sorry)...\n  \u2022 Arcade beat'em up action.\n\u2022 Multiple Modes.\n\u2022 Levelling system, with transferable skills to new characters.\n\u2022 Local & Online co-op with up to 4 players.\n\u2022 A variety of thematic environments and enemies.\n\u2022 Unlockable costumes with unique gameplay properties.\n\u2022 Beautiful hand-painted art.\n\u2022 Unique character design.\n Claws of Furry could have been released months ago in a terribly unfinished state, the basics were in and it was certainly playable but we simply didn't have the resources to continue it. As we started to wrap it up and began showing it off to people and events, we realised that people were genuinely enjoying the game and wanted more, a lot more. We got some great feedback and ultimately realised that we had to keep pushing it. Somehow.\nWe've spent the last few months refining almost every aspect of the game, iteration after iteration, making sure that the combat is fluid, the enemies are engaging, the world's are well developed and the code is bug free (mostly). There's still much to do but we're glad that we kept at it, instead of trying to finish it early.\nAnd so we reach a similar point again, only massively over budget this time. We know we've built a great game but we simply can't continue to develop CoF full time. We've trimmed the GDD (Game Design Document) and prepared ourselves for releasing a quality, but short product if we fail at gathering funds. That would be a shame though, the game in its current state is like a cat that you only keep in one room because you're a terrible person. The cat might be fantastic and glorious but it needs more than a room. It needs the whole house, it needs the neighbours houses and all their lawns and all the trees and long grass, it longs to sit in the sun and dream of things like sitting in the sun a little bit longer.\n\nSo please, if you're against keeping cats trapped in tiny rooms, consider helping us out and together we can release these perfectly cute killing machines and allow them to do what they do best.\nWe give our best to stay true to our development pipeline and as close to our concepts as possible.\n  Some of it at least...\n  Main Character\n  Rats, Crocs, Dopermans and Fatodiles concept art.\n  Riot Dog\nNo compatible credit card, but you still want to support us? You can do it with PayPal! Just click here!\n                        Stretch goals are in sterling, prices don't reflect USD.\nStretch Goals:\n\u2022 New Game +\nYou think beating the game once isn't going to be challenging? Try the New Game + for an insane new level of difficulty.\n\u2022 Nintendo Switch\nThe game will be released on Nintendo Switch, so that's at-least 2 games you can play on it. Hah! (we like the Nintendo Switch)\n\u2022 5th Chapter\nA whole new chapter in addition to the four existing ones, with a new thematic environment, enemies and of course, a boss.\n\u2022 PVP Arena Mode\nYour best friend just told us that they could beat you in a ninja cat fight. We said \"No way!\", but they were pretty adamant. Kick your feet against your own face and get startled by gusts of wind to show them how wrong they are.\n\u2022 Boss Rush Mode\nWant to endlessly fight all the bosses again and again until you perish? You should probably call your doctor immediately, and tell them about this awesome mode we want to add in the game.\n\u2022 20 Extra Costumes\nCats really don't like it when you try to dress them up, but it is hilarious. So we're offering extra costumes with their own attributes and special moves. Will you be able to unlock them all?\n\u2022 Unlockable Characters\nLook, maybe you're not even a cat person, we get it. Luckily for you I've just realised our game is called CLAWS of Furry, and not CATS of Furry so we can do many different playable animals.\n\u2022 6th & 7th Chapters\nRemember when we wanted funding for the 5th chapter? Those were the good old days, but now it's time for more! More chapters means more enemies, environments and an extended challenge to keep you purring all night long.\nThis might not come as a surprise, but we're a games studio. A games studio that dabbles in almost anything to do with real-time experiences. Since Terahard's inception back in 2012 we've been hired to do all sorts of things, from big machine simulations for oil companies, to showing off Nike shoes on virtual shelves. We had always intended to make games, but with such a varied and talented team we find it easy to get involved with projects from many different industries. Whenever we have a moment spare however, we would delve into our own projects, our own games and try to bring something to life. Claws of Furry is our latest attempt, and so far the feedback has motivated us to try and push it even further.\nTerahardprimarily consists of games industry folk from a number of talented studios such as Roll7 and Curve, we've got a lot of experience individually and many of us nearing a decade in the industry. Our entire core team is made up of 12 full-time developers, which is pretty large for such a small studio, but it allows us to balance multiple projects while still maintaining our own IPs, perhaps with your help we can begin this story, and become well known for making games that people love.\nWe don't need to tell you that we love games, and how it's our goal to keep making them, such information is implied by our being here and trying to attend as many events as possible worldwide. What we would like to say though, is just a thank you for checking us out, and a huge thank you for even reading this.\n  -  OnlySP, Indie Highlight Reel\n-  Dacespace, Topic Nintendo Podcast 9, 25:20 min\nFacebook\nTwitter\nYoutube\nInstagram\nDiscord\nGreenlight (outdated info)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe believe that so much work has been put into Claws of Furry already that the risks and challenges are far less than most other kickstarter projects. That's not to say we're out of any danger. All projects with a deadline are inherently open to risk, the two biggest of course are time, and money.\n\nTime: As we've mentioned before, Claws of Furry is already in a good state, we've been developing it for over a year now and had even planned to release it much earlier and call it done, but the people wanted more, and it motivated us to continue adding content and refining the mechanics. We've realized that Claws of Furry could be a much bigger game than we had originally anticipated, and we'd love to see how far it can go. \n\nMoney: The be all and end all of almost everything on earth. Fortunately we're a studio who've been operating for over 5 years now, we've already got our team, and we're very comfortable with building games. This means that the vast majority of your funding goes straight into the continued development, there are no new hires, no unknowns, no services or catches. We believe that we're not asking for much, we just need enough money so that we can focus on Claws of Furry full time until it's done, otherwise it's back to regular client work and developing the game whenever we have a moment to spare. Claws of Furry is getting finished regardless, the only questions are how content rich it will be, and when it will be delivered. Your funding will answer these questions.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Terahard\nFirst created \u00b7 4 backed\nTerahard Studios is a game company that was established in 2012.

Finding a chained locket in her father\u2019s hotel, Jennifer attempts to use her childhood gift for talking to ghosts to call his spirit back. Unwittingly, the ghost recalled is that of Oscar Wilde, famous Irish playwright, whose affair with Jennifer\u2019s father has bound his ghost to the locket. \nJennifer and Oscar find themselves involved in schemes of murder, ghosts and intrigue as they attempt to solve Jennifer\u2019s father\u2019s murder, and develop a deep friendship along the way\u2026 \nBased on the best-selling and award winning comic from Atomic Diner.\nThere's no better way to experience Paris than to visit yourself. Download our Windows Demo here. The game is very much a work-in-progress, so please forgive the bugs! \nJennifer Wilde Gameplay\nJennifer Wilde is a Point & Click 2D adventure game with a unique comic book inventory design. As Jennifer discovers clues to her father\u2019s death, she sketches illustrated notes in her book; which the player can study, rearrange and combine into a comic book-style story. Use this illustrated knowledge to confront characters, prompt their memories and link clues together as you discover more about Jennifer\u2019s father\u2019s hidden past, and the truth behind his death.\nUnique take on the classic inventory\nAlongside the comic book mysteries, environmental, dialogue and classic inventory puzzles will vex your brain along the way, with crafty but logical solutions ready to be solved.\nEnvironmental puzzles to tax your brain\nKey features  \nPlay as both Jennifer and the ghost of Irish playwright, Oscar Wilde.\nUnique comic book-style inventory \nChoices affect the outcome of the story \nVisit Paris, London and Dublin \nFully illustrated in Black & White line art by comic artists, with a mix of traditional and rigged animation \nDirect control or classic point & click\nLast year the team at Outsider Games launched our first PC game, Wailing Heights, on Steam to positive reviews and several award nominations. Since then we\u2019ve been working hard on developing Jennifer Wilde as our next big project!   \nJennifer Wilde is a project Outsider Games has been working on for over a year now, as a spiritual follow-up to our award nominated adventure game, Wailing Heights.  \nThe game is feature-complete, and we\u2019ve completed the script and art for approximately the first third of the game. We\u2019re turning to Kickstarter and the community to help raise funds to produce the game in it\u2019s entirety. We want to improve upon, and polish, all aspects of the game from animation to music and sound, and tell this story as we envision it. \nWe\u2019ve worked hard to get this far in development with help from Northern Ireland Screen and Atomic Diner, while putting in many additional hours and as much time as we can afford ourselves. \nWe\u2019re running this campaign because we need your help to finish Jennifer\u2019s story!  \nFunding Breakdown   \nHitting our Kickstarter goal of \u00a311,000 will secure further match funding, bringing the total game budget to \u00a343,000. This will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish we envision. \nBelow is a breakdown of the game budget, and how Kickstarter funds will help us complete our goal. \nWe have a great collection of rewards for backers, from a copy of the game, to our Jazz-filled soundtrack, a gorgeous digital artbook, copies of the original comics, hand-drawn original artwork, and even a chance to be animated IN the game!\nEnvironments\nJust some of the environments Jennifer and Oscar encounter as they travel between France, England and Ireland.\nConcepts\nConcepts for environments later in the game.

We have many favorites on the original Playstation and N64 and aim to honor mid-to-late 90's mascots we grew up with such as Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon while bringing our own unique elements to the table. We can't compare Griff to the greats, but we can make a fun tribute with its own heart and soul. If you love the simple charm of early 3D, then jump on board my radical friend, because things are about to get old-school!\n  A new level of retro: play in PS1 style plus N64 & Dreamcast styles.\nGlide across chasms, avoid deadly hazards, and earn new abilities.\n10 mythological realms filled with colorful creatures & characters.\nFun-filled character driven story line with full voiceover dialogue.\n5 playable characters and a variety of challenging minigames.\nShatter enemies, objects and scenery into collectible gold pieces.\nReveal new paths and turn objects into gold for puzzle solving too.\nTake down a slew of challenging beastly foes and insane bosses.\nPurchase special costumes and wings like Pegasus and Phoenix.\n\n     A playable demo of Griff the Winged Lion is now available!\n  System Requirements: \nOS: Windows Vista, 7, 8, 10 \nProcessor: 2.0 GHz or greater\nMemory: 1 GB RAM (2 GB recommended)\nHard Disk Space: 1 GB free \nDirectX: Version 9.0c or greater\nSound: Standard audio device\nNote: This is an early demo, so there may be a few bugs. Animations, mechanics, art, sound and controls are subject to change and improvement during development.\n\n    Release Estimates: With the game in early development, these estimates are subject to change, but we'll be making updates to keep you informed.\nPC Early Demo (Available now)\nPC Early Demo 2 (Available shortly after Kickstarter)\nTesting Session 1 (Summer 2018)\nTesting Session 2 (Fall 2018)\nBeta Testing Session (Estimated Holiday 2018)\nSteam Release (Estimated 2018-2019 TBD)\nXbox One Release (Estimated 2018-2019 TBD)  \nPS4 Release (Estimated 2018-2019 TBD)\nNotes:  \nDue to the submission and porting process, PS4 and Xbox One console versions may release sometime later than the Steam version, but we'll be aiming to get the console editions released as close as possible to the Steam release window.  \nWe are looking into the possibility of a Nintendo Switch release. This may depend on how funding and stretch goals turn out, but we love Nintendo consoles and we'll be doing the best we can to achieve this.\n\n  Note: Products shown are visual representations of digital rewards and are not physical merchandise. However, some physical products and merch may become available. Check future updates for details on this.\nIn the medieval kingdom of Autumn Terrace, a young prince named Griff is called upon to participate in a magical tradition. Once each generation, an old mage foresees the destinies of the kingdom's future leaders and bestows them with their sacred roles. When this time comes for Griff, however, his role is mysteriously shrouded from the mage. Griff embarks on an epic, yet unexpectedly hazardous journey through the neighboring realms in search of answers to the riddle of his destiny. With the help of his friends; Gargle (a hilariously over-reactive yet determined little gargoyle), Gavin (a brave griffin), Terra (a unicorn with remarkable powers) and Mia (a phantom cat with a sweet tooth for adventure) the young prince must unearth his true purpose and defend the realms against the treacherous tides which lay before them.\n  Griff is the main hero you play as, plus there are four other heroes you can control in a variety of fun levels and mini-game challenges!\n            A long, long time ago, the great King Midas was struck by a terrible curse. All that he touched, would turn to solid gold. In desperation, Midas turned to a sorcerer to help him control this terrible hex. The mage used his sorcery on a seemingly useless old pair of gloves, presenting them to the King. Once Midas put them on, they were old gloves no more, but instantly became a powerful relic of the purest golden sheen. \nFrom that moment and ever afterward, this magical artifact could control the curse and prevent it from turning everything it touched. Midas even gained the ability to control the curse, and to use it when he desired. It is said that one strike of these mystical fists turns anything to glittering gold. While nothing originally of gold is affected by the Midas touch, that which is already made of cursed gold will shatter into a thousand pieces with a second blow. \nAfter Midas' passing, the golden gloves were taken to a magical shrine and sealed away for centuries. Even to this day, the Midas gloves have long been sought after by greedy creatures who desire only dominion and wealth, even at the cost of trampling on the weak and the meek... \nOnce obtained, you can use the Midas gloves to turn many objects, scenery and enemies into gold, then shatter them and collect their scattered parts. The golden power can also be used to turn objects into gold when solving puzzles (e.g. at a shrine that requires a gold offering, or to change the weight of a puzzle object). Secrets are found within every area as well and new paths or platforms can often be revealed using the power of the gloves. \n    After 20+ years the original Playstation and N64 have become retro systems. Similarly to indie games creating nostalgic 8 & 16-bit aesthetics, we're aiming to harness some of the charm and simplicity of some of our favorite late 90's platformers. This is no easy task of course; many things must be considered. Despite the early 3D aesthetics, we've done away with some of the old limitations such as low frame-rate and low resolution. we have only imitated low-resolution edges with a crisp edge pixelator. We're also planning a very high animation quality with loads of lip sync and silly 'squash and stretch' movement, as seen in games like Crash Bandicoot 3 Warped and Banjo Kazooie. This takes a lot of time to achieve and we'll need to be as creative as possible with the low amount of polygons at our disposal. We absolutely love the look of pixelated textures on low-poly 3D. We'd like to get the design and aesthetics as authentic as possible, artistically and nostalgically speaking.\n        No 3D 90's platformer could be truly complete without having a comically burned or flattened protagonist. Griff the Winged Lion will feature a plethora of cartoony death animations for you to deflate your frustrations whenever we've clearly made a certain area too difficult. No worries, we'll try to keep things challenging at a steady rise without turning your head into a boiling tea kettle.\n    Griff's magical portals branch from his main world in Autumn Terrace to other magical realms with different culture's mythologies, each with their own characters and creatures. \n        We'll be using funding from Kickstarter for supporting the team in their development focus as well as on various assets for the release. Costs for system porting and release marketing will be provided by our Publisher, Spiral Summit Games. They're relatively small and new in the game themselves, but they have a lot of prior industry experience and have been great to work with for both us and other indies. As usual with gaming budgets, the goal may not cover the entire development cost, but the support, pledges and feedback of our backers is invaluable for helping Griff take off!\n                       ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLuckily, most of the main concerns we had about developing a 3D platformer with these particular mechanics were solved with the completion of our playable demo. Having a playable core from the get-go ensured we'd have a solid foundation to work from to implement the more involved systems and style elements.\n \nAs with any game project, there may be future issues and bugs that insist on overstaying their welcome and happen only once in a blue moon. We'll do our best to resolve any issues and remain open and honest about everything. We do this both for you and just because we're naturally obsessive like that.\n\nAlthough this won't be our first completed title, it's certainly our biggest and most ambitious yet. Anytime you explore new ground there will always be some unforeseen problems. As long time friends, we believe in discussing issues openly, even if it means admitting failure or starting a piece over and attempting to go about it a better way. \n\nEven though we know these problems and risks may pop up, we believe in our ability to push through all these to deliver a great gaming experience for you guys.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Jake Pawloski\n2 created \u00b7 0 backed\nI've been working in indie games for about 9 years.

Anyone reading it would feel the same fear Dante felt about to enter hell, but it also made me wonder what would happen if someone about to enter this tragic place was worse than the Devil himself, and so it occurred to me to write Savage: Road to Darkness.\n         Become Oni Wani, uncover the mystery about his past and turn into a merciless warrior in a merciless world. Let his Darkness consume you and survive using his violent instinct.\nAkuma no Rakuen (Devil's Paradise) is a big continent, full of life and challenge, replete of beauty and danger. The whole area is connected and what lies beyond, in each part of Akuma no Rakuken, is unknown.\nOnce you decide to play this game you must leave all salvation behind you, and strive to survive and become stronger.\nWelcome to the Darkness.\n     The king has passed away and for ten years his kingdom, an incredible world finds itself sunk in an endless war due to the void left since the king's death has awaken many people's desire to take over the empty throne. Akuma no Rakuen has split off and a whole continent lays under the laws of some self-claimed kings, who with a great power and intellect, have accomplished to own a vast extension of territory in which everyone who crosses their path is forced to submit.\nA legend lives in the shadows like a whisper that manifests itself as a myth among the faithfuls to the previous king... \"The dragon will come and the fire will consume everything to make of paradise his kingdom\".\n    Ninjutsu:  An ancient lethal art that defines a ninja. It allows Oni Wani to use a variety of weapons and secret techniques, in order to transform himself into a living weapon.\nShinobigana (ninja sword): A deadly discipline that only few beings can master. Oni Wani can use any kind of ninjaken (ninja blades) with tremendous dexterity and precision, even the legendary Cursed One. Different types of ninjaken exists, each one with its own unique effects. So be prepared to improve your sword skills and become a master.\nChakra/Jutsu: Chakra is the energy of life, created from all livings things. Several forms of Chakra exist that affects the nature of the individual. By harnessing this energy special, powerful techniques can derived, known as Jutsus. Wani can bend the Chakra energy to his will, enabling him to switch between its different manifestations. Those who run out of Chakra will perish.\nShinobi Hidden: Special abilities that can be used for defense,deception, stealth and engage.Embracing these skills will make the Darkness your ally.\n       The driving force of the story is a mysterious anthropomorphic being called Oni Wani.\nHe was given the name based upon his close resemblance of a crocodile (wani) and his demonic (oni) nature that brings chaos to any land he sets foot on. He was reborn from the Greater Tree of the lost continent, Akuma no Rakuen, with his memory wiped clean. Lost without memory, the emptiness he feels strongly tempts him with anger and violence.\nWith his beating heart, Wani forges a weapon created by his deep hatred.

However, after months of development and careful planning the project has rapidly evolved, featuring an incredibly extended world, an exciting story, and expanded gameplay features.\nFurthermore, this project makes use of high definition 2D art which is one of the most expensive forms of art. To produce a high quality visual result like that requires a lot of work, patience and time. Our general scope for the future is to establish Artcle Studio as a full game company, which means that we will have to deal with different forms of costs, like operational, licensing, and living costs.\nTaking the above points under consideration, this game will require the help of the community in order to be able to reach its final form within a proper deadline.

This passion drove us to undertake a lot of risks, including pushing back our Kickstarter campaign for several months in order to have something truly amazing in our hands. Hand-drawn, high quality art like this comes at a high price and requires the aid of some very talented people. But that didn't stop us investing time, money and energy so we could design the world of Akuma no Rakuen exactly as we have imagined it. \n\n\nWe worked extensively for months into building a functional prototype so that you can have a better understanding of our game design, as well as our final vision. Most of the core mechanics and basic framework is in place, however, there is always room for improvement. We have carefully planned our development stages with deadlines to ensure the smooth production of this game. Art will be further polished and gameplay will be greatly expanded and enhanced since this is required to produce the gaming experience that we have envisioned. \n\nThis is the labour of love that we've always wanted to create: A beautiful, challenging game with cool powers and awesome characters. We have a lot of work ahead of us, because like our protagonist Oni Wani, we are striving for complete mastery of our skills. It is important for us for this project succeeds, since this is just the beginning of Oni Wani's journey and we plan to turn his endeavour into a complete saga!

Some others will add obstacles (like gluing/slowing puddle, moving walls, ...), or ennemies (like green energy ghosts, fire cannons, electric ball barriels, ...). The player will have to bring the robot to the blue PortalSphere, end of the level, using only arrow keys of the keyboard.\n  Rich in graphics and dynamic music that boosts both energy and concentration, LabyX strives, above all, to discover, test and memorize the maze levels, carefully studied / handcrafted in order to offer subtle and complex traps.\nLabyX is a company that recycles defective robots into a game of labyrinths. Buying problematic robots directly from the factory, they offer a low cost experience for people : remotely control their own robot in complex mazes. Until now, no one has managed to reach the exit of the last level, and rumors are going on about what will wait the one who'll succeed. As soon as the concept was released, anti-LabyX groups focused on the protection of these robots have emerged all over the world ...  \n... But the experts assured that no robot had any consciousness, or sensory perception, and that Labyx could be compared to remote controlled car tournaments. Since then, LabyX has become a benchmark in entertainment, in which many players have embarked : Contest e-sport, Youtubers, Twitchers, ... everyone hopes to win the ultimate glory of being the first to cross the inaccessible exit with his little robot. Will it be you?\nFirst of all, I'm a musician, a music composer and a music teacher. All I do in life is close to the music domain. When I've decided to create this game, the first thing was to imagine a world born from my music. A sort of interactive experience around the sounds. So every level of this game have been made - path, concept and aesthetic - from a music I've created previously. I listen a loop of the music during all the realisation of the level : every sound, rythmic, harmonic or timbral variation I've composed has thereby an impact on how I'll conceve each maze.\n        As a music composer, I've already written some music for different projects. You can hear them on my My Soundcloud profile, or follow these Bandcamp links :\nLabyX Pre-Order\n\"3\" BlackCube\nTriptique pianistique\nMusic for Independant Projects\nSmall Practice OST\nBoinihi OST (soon)\nLabyX is therefore a game that will enhance memory, reflexes, and aid stress management. If the end of the fourth level of the current pack is not reached, the player will have to resume at the beginning of the first level of the current pack to continue their adventure. Do not hope to finish this game quickly: although the levels are medium sized, this does not impact negatively upon the ability to ensure that they are sufficiently challenging.\n  LabyX has been designed to play in window mode, like many simple games that can be easily be placed in the background (be warned though: the game will continue to be operational, the timer will not cease and the enemies will still be lurking), it is, however, possible to play in full screen if the player prefers. LabyX will be compatible with most of computer operating Windows (XP/Seven/10).\nA demo of this game is available on GameJolt, to give you a taster of what awaits you. \n  This demo has no restrictions, except for the number of levels (16 in all, 4 packs of 4 levels). It is therefore possible for you to see / understand what LabyX has in store for you. The Kickstarter campaign provides for a game of over 60 different levels! And LabyX can develop further if a specific level of participation is reached (in this case LabyX could potentially go up to 100 levels or more!).\nGames I've made/participated :  \n\"3\" (Black Cube) (everything)  \nAmertis (some graphics)  \nSmall Pratice (everything)  \nBo\u00efnihi (music)\nWonderful tools for which I have acquired the appropriate official licenses: \nGraphic : \nVue Complete\nGroboto V3 \nPoser Pro \nMusic : \nMusic Creator Touch\nEWQLSO sound bank \nZ3ta +2 \nProgrammation : \nFusion 2.5 Dev\n   A new star is born : the steps\nGroboto Modelisation\n  Vue Complete Texturing\n  Poser Rigging/Animation\n           3 000 \u20ac: the game is funded (60 levels) \n6 000 \u20ac: addition of several tens of levels and additional music \n10 000 \u20ac: addition of a story, animations / cinematics\n          PLAY\n\n  Zeus : by Jupiter, this game enlights me ! \nBender : hey GBT.X !

The backers who have chosen a reward including the beta /test versions will be able to play/test the first level of each new pack as soon as it is ready/playable.\nLabyX in its demo version (functional engine, 16 levels, management of backups, ...) took me a big month of hard work. Let this be the assurance that I am able to lead this project to its conclusion, without disappointing any potential backers with setbacks. I will be available directly on Kickstarter, and commit to answer questions and comments, whilst also regularly bringing news about the project\u2019s development progress.  \nWhilst I will be combining the creation of this game with my job as a music teacher, as soon as the Kickstarter campaign is launched, I shall remain in daily communication with the backers and will maintain this direct link between the myself and the backers throughout the creation of LabyX . Having supported many Kickstarter campaigns, I know that sometimes very little information is given to the backers and so I am all too aware of which pitfalls to avoid. You can count on my regular presence here, as well as complete transparency around LabyX.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main risk factor for the project is that it is entirely designed, managed, conducted and realized by only one person: me.

I think this console still has a lot to say and this game will be proof of that.\nThis game is designed from the ground up and optimized for the PS Vita, in order to deliver the best experience.\nThe Game\nThe main idea of the game is a co-op experience in a hostile environment. So it's not going to be the standard \"lets be friends\" approach but more of a \"we need to cooperate in order to survive\". You're not a knight in shining armor but rather a rogue with his own agenda.\nIn Rogue Raiders Online, there is no galaxy to save but a rent to pay.\nYou start creating and customizing your own raider, choosing between several alien races and classes, each one with unique stats and traits that may dramatically affect your gameplay.\nThen you will be sent to a near space station which serves as a central hub for players to find each other, purchase better equipment, sell valuables, etc.\nThere will be job boards, which list available quests for you or your team. After assembling a crew, you will travel to a planet to do the job.\nPlanets will be handmade, no procedural or random planets that end up looking all up the same.\nLike any other RPG, Rogue Raiders is filled with quests or jobs for you and your team to do.\nThe jobs you can get will vary depending on your raider cred, your reputation with the three main factions, among other things.\nThey are varied and can involve tasks like traveling to a spaceship crash site in order to find survivors, scavenge the remaining gear, doing planetary cartography, steal trade secrets for a rival faction, etc.\nThese jobs are a collaborative effort, although sometimes one of your crew can have a secret \"rogue objective\" than can jeopardize the current mission, so you never know up to what point you can trust the others.\nAfter all you are all rogues so what can you expect!\nThe game will feature a singleplayer offline mode too, so you can go and explore on your own, hunt creatures, or maybe find a nice robot, hack it to later resell it and earn some credits.\nEach world has its own biome, dungeons, puzzles, enemies and treasures. The events in them will constantly change, so they will be living worlds with constant activity.\nMy main inspiration for the visual design of the galaxy and worlds is the sci-fi art from the 60s and the 70s. I want each planet to have a unique set of colors, and to provide an eerie feeling to the players.\nI've worked in creating a color palette with enough personality and contrast, that will help to differentiate and make interesting each planet and new area that you explore.\nAbout Me\nI've been working in the games industry as a programmer and designer for more than 10 years now.\nMy last released games includes various titles for PlayStation Vita, and I have worked on plenty of online multiplayer games, creating the network code for multiple platforms, so I have a deep knowledge about the console and network design and optimization.\nSome of the previous games I've worked are \"Phineas and Ferb: Day of Doofenshmirtz\", \"Muppets Movie Adventures\" and \"Young Justice Legacy\".\nI, for once, want to create something personal. This game is being made by just me, an one woman army. That's why I'm calling the studio \"Dangerous Alone\" :-)\nSoundtrack\nYou can already check some of the music I composed for Rogue Raiders in SoundCloud:\nHow will the Kickstarter money be used?\nDeveloping a video game cost a lot of money. For a PS Vita title, I will need to pay for some devkits (I need multiple to debug multiplayer), the rating systems like PEGI cost money even for indies, a lot of the money will go away in paying taxes, and of course Kickstarter takes the 5%.\nThe rest of the money will be used to pay for the extra work I can't get done, specially art (3d models, animations, etc). I have tried to set a really low budget, so unless the stretch goals are hit, most of the work will still depend on me.\nWhy should I support this game?\nThis is a personal project, and I know I'm competing against big publishers with large budgets, Hollywood actors, hundreds of hours of cutscenes and lots of in-game content.\nI need to be smart and aim to the things those publishers aren't giving to the current players.\nThey rely in their big budget to create hundreds of mini games, side quests, etc. Thinking that if they give the player a lot to do they will end liking the game.\nI'm doing the opposite, I'm creating a game based on the philosophy of people like Shigeru Miyamoto or Gunpei Yokoi, creating a simple core gameplay that is fun by its own.\nWith money, you can put a lot of fancy stuff that makes people forget about the foundation. But if the core of your game is good, that's what really matters.\nSo if you want a simple, yet fun and challenging experience, Rogue Raiders Online is your game.\nStretch Goals\n Follow us!\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBeing small, I need to be realistic. Content wise, this game will be closer to a NES game than a current Rockstar/Bethesda triple A, open world game. Nobody has ever told me that Zelda, Faxanadu or Battle of Olympus were too short, so I don't think that adding lots of features makes for a better game. I think that creating a fun core gameplay is what really matters.\n\nThe online part is an added difficulty, and requires lots of work in QA (beta testing), for that part, since this is a exclusive title, I will negotiate a publishing deal with Sony that warrants me QA from them. Worst case scenario, I will use part of the budget to pay a professional testing company. I want to release a good game.\n\nCreating a video game is always a challenge, and previous experience developing and releasing games is key to success.\n\nI've been working in the games industry as a programmer and designer for more than 10 years now.\n\nMy last released games includes various titles for PlayStation Vita, and I have worked on plenty of online multiplayer games, creating the network code for multiple platforms, so I have a deep knowledge about the console and network design and optimization.\n\nI'm confident that I'm up to the task, since I have successfully released similar games in the past.\n\nBackers will have full access to the private forums, development log and project status, with each milestone detailed and info about each current task in progress.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Cristina Martin\n2 created \u00b7 16 backed\nGame developer, kickboxer, adventure lover and part time assassin.See more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "\u2764\ufe0f Show your love! \u2764\ufe0f", "descp": "Your contribution will demonstrate that there's interest in this game!\nINCLUDES:\nAccess to the dev blog and forum exclusive to backers.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2016"}], "stat": ["13 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac20 or more", "title": "\u0f3c \u3064 \u25d5_\u25d5 \u0f3d\u3064 Get the GAME", "descp": "You will get the full game.\nINCLUDES:\nA digital copy of the full game.\nAccess to the dev blog and forum exclusive to backers.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2018"}], "stat": ["116 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac35 or more", "title": "Collector's Edition", "descp": "You will get all the rewards previously stated AND you'll also receive a download of the digital art book and the full soundtrack!\nINCLUDES:\nDigital art book.\nDigital soundtrack.\nA digital copy of the full game.\nAccess to the dev blog and forum exclusive to backers.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2018"}], "stat": ["38 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac45 or more", "title": "Beta Access Raider", "descp": "You will have access to a special development build for PC so you can test the actual state of the game during development!\nINCLUDES:\nBeta Access\nAccess to the dev blog and forum exclusive to backers.\nA digital copy of the full game.\nDigital art book.\nDigital soundtrack.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2018"}], "stat": ["16 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac65 or more", "title": "Proud to be a Rogue Raider (TM)", "descp": "You will get all the rewards previously stated AND you will receive a LIMITED custom Raiders t-shirt, only for backers of this campaign.

Explore the megalopolis, the asylum and various locations, and complete quests.\nYou are able to interact with almost anything in the world, grab and use items, solve puzzles and speak with characters (your answers may affect your relationship with your partner).\n Many activities are available ! If you want, you can play mini-games, visit some shops and restaurants (Fastbouf), send messages, surf the \"Ultranet\" and even read many comments on the social network \"Lookme\".\nThe game will be available in English and French.

The project is ambitious in its scope. To do justice to what I have planned will require time and funding.\nYour support will allow me to dedicate myself fully to making the game.\nThere are also elements which require other people's expertise: Translations and voice acting.

Please take a look around to know more about Never Look Back and how you can help! Thank you so much for your time!\n   \nQuotes\n  First of all, we are offering you to personaly explore Never Look Back by playing the fully-functioning demo version of the game. You can download it by pressing the button below.\n  Okay, let's get started!\n  Never Look Back is an adventure horror game with a heavy focus on story and exploration which is set for release in 2017 on Windows, Mac and Linux platforms.\nThe gameplay experience is a mix of adventure and psychedelic horror, which allows you to live through the Mark's eyes and help him to face his demons. \nInspect every detail on carefully designed levels, use your deduction, solve puzzles to move forward and to get a feel for the horror atmosphere.\nAnd for heaven's sake... never look back.\nRelax Mark, everything is fine.\n  As game designers we get inspired by authors such as Stephen King, Bram Stoker, H. P. Lovecraft and games like The Legend of Kyrandia, Clock Tower, Resident Evil, Penumbra, Amnesia, P.T. and Layers of Fear.\n  Hand-painted retro-style pixel graphics combined with rich visual effects to achieve the highest level of immersion.\nClassic adventure gameplay full of clever puzzles, hidden secrets and important choices, which lead you up at least to 3 different endings.\n    I think I figured it out...\nDetailed and fully interactive environment.\nStory-focused exploration \u2013 only through exploring the environment you can shed some light on Mark's story, full of drama and mystery.\nIn addition to the main story, you will be able to find items, which uncover some horryfying facts about mansion and it's owners.\n\u0421omplete with a tense atmosphere which won't let you go until the end.\nLamp will be your only guide in the darkness.\nA chain of Mark's flashbacks to complete the plot development.\nFull English voice acting.\nA lot of references to your favourite games, books and films.\n  Something weird is happening with Mark Walters - an unknown 23 year old writer from Salford, Manchester.\nMark's appartment. Locations like this will bring variety...\nFor two weeks he is chased by the same nightmare. He is running in circles for hours without the slightest possibility of escape. One day as he is leaving his appartment he wakes up in an abandoned mansion, full of mysteries.\nAlong with Mark you will have to explore the darkest corners of the mansion. Be ready to help the main character unveil what really is going on in this forsaken place, because the answer to that might not be so simple as it might seem.\n... but remember - evil never sleeps.\n    Since we are big fans of point&click games, we decided to use classical mechanics of the genre for the core of our game. Along with our vision, they create unique mechanics of Never Look Back. Our goal in terms of gameplay is quiet simple - create a game where even the slightest details of each mechanic recieve a lot of attention and time.\nThroughout the journey you will have to overcome many obstacles, by solving all sorts of puzzles and riddles.\nYou should also be ready to face the horrifying and very unfriendly residents of the mansion, who will be doing their best to stop you from going further. \nYou will have to run and hide. Wait for the opportunity to outsmart them. Remember - retreat is not an act of cowardice but rather a key to survival.\nSo what exactly do you need to do? The answer is simple - everything that you can. In Never Look Back you should be very attentive to details, in certain locations you have to be VERY attentive. We, in turn, will be doing everything we can to ensure that puzzles and riddles are logical. \nAll of the gameplay is based on the interaction between the player and the enviroment. You will have an inventory at your disposal, in which you will be collecting all the nessessary items,\npersonal diary, where Mark will be writing his own comments about the events happening in game, and also a lamp, your only bastion of light in the neverending darkness of the mansion\u2026\n  What makes our game special, is that in unlike traditional point&click games, the player can move around using two keys:\nWe used this system in order to convey the tactile feeling of the character to the fullest, which is extremely important for the atmosphere of the game and our vision of the player experience.\nIn Never Look Back, the cursor will change depending on the action, which you decide to do with the object.\nInspect cursor - you will be able to take a closer look at the object and also hear Mark's thoughts about it.\nInteract cursor - you can activate the object (lever, button, lamp, etc.) and see what happens.\nTake cursor - pick up an important (or not) inventory item.\nMove cursor - navigate from one location to another through doors.\nItem cursor - when choosing an object from the inventory, cursor takes the form of the item. When clicking on any object with thus cursor, the item, if it's possible, will be applied.\nLot's of important objects are hidden from your eyes in boxes and drawers. This unique mechanic eases the access to what they contain. \n\n\n  Another helpful mechanic is the inspection mode, which allows you to take a closer look at the object and see the details which you didn't at first.\n... the wine stain for example.\nAs you see, all the design solutions in the product support the following goals: develop a quality story-driven adventure game.\n  We spent a lot of time trying to choose the most fitting music for this atmosphere. The unbelievable and amazing Kevin Macleod helped us with that. His compositions perfectly convey the sense of alarm and horror, which is nessesary for our genre. His great works were used in games such as: The Stanley Parable, SCP - Containment Breach, Kerbal Space Program, The Bridge, Robocraft and many more.\nLegend.\n    Don't Panic Arts is a small indie game development team, fully composed of students. We were all brought together by your dream - making video games. In all of our hearts they have a special place.\nOur team has only one simple goal - to show the world, that in order to make quality games you don\u2019t need a large game development company. The most important part - is what\u2019s inside. The thing which makes you play the game over and over again. The soul of the game.\nNever Look Back is about 40% complete.\nWe've already implement most of the game mechanics, designed locations and finished our story pipeline. The next steps are as follows:\n- finish writing dialogues and voice over them;\n- create the remaining world art;\n- work more on the atmosphere, music, sounds and cutscenes;\n- polish animations and gameplay.\nWe are aiming to be complete the project by late 2016 - early 2017. \n  Kickstarter has played an important role in the indie game development community for a long time now. Thanks to it, a lot of exciting projects have been launched that never could have been possible otherwise.\nWe've been working full-time for a few month now, but to continue working full-time on this project we need a little financial support. We're putting everything we can into this project every single day and we're asking you to trust us when we say: Never Look Back will be an amazing story-driven adventure. The money, feedback and support you invest in it will be worth it!\nAn approximate chart that shows the different things your money will be used for.\n              Website\nFacebook\nTwitter", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGame development was never an easy task - it's always a difficult and complicated process. Anytime there is a chance that some sorts of problems will pop up, but we are highly motivated, we are ready to face them, because bringing this project to life is our dream.\n\nWe're currently in the midst of the Never Look Back development.

It sent out swarms of Nano Bots that attacked the people of the base, flew into their world and infected them with just a glance, planting Wardens in their minds. A robotic virus raged!\nYou've been sent so save the Asteroid Base!\nThe clone\nThe Wardens enslave the people! You are one of the hacker clones, saving people by hacking into their brains and defeating Wardens.\nThe startscreen\n   It starts with a button!\nButton based puzzles\nAt the release the game will include 5 people to save. Their brains are enslaved by a robotic virus.\nEvery brain is infected with about 15-20 Wardens each. Every Warden is a level with a button puzzle for the player to unlock. \nA brain is one world.\nA brain infected with Wardens\n Zooming in...\nTo defeat a Warden the player has to click the Warden's buttons in the correct sequence. Clicking uses function() calls. You only have a set amount of functions per level.\nA Warden\nThe Wardens contains many different puzzle combinations including memory, timer, timing, forming patterns, matching and more. \nBecause we love buttons\nSome puzzles are easy and chill, and some are harder. We wanted to make a causal game that is fun to play. And we love pressing buttons! Hope you do too!\nWhen you've managed to save one brain, the next world is unlocked with new Wardens. \nBosses\nEvery brain will include 1 or more bosses to fight!  The boss gameplay resolves around timing a circle and a box. When they overlay the player has to click to unlock a pattern.\nThe 6th world will be a procedurally generated boss level, with endless boss fighting!\nUnlock next world\nTo unlock the next world the player needs to beat the world boss. The boss is unlocked when the player has gathered X points. Every Warden defeated gives 0-3 points depending on how many function() calls the player has used. Every Warden is re-playable, meaning that the player can get a better score if playing again.\nWindows\nMac\nLinux\nAndroid \niOS\nMobile\nThe game got greenlit a couple of months ago, so imprint-X is also coming to Steam!\nWe're aiming to release imprint-X pretty soon, probably this autumn! \nWe've gotten quite far with the development and worked on the game since december 2015 and now got an alpha ready!\nThe first level prototype we ever made for imprint-X back in December.\n  We're developing the game in Unity and for now we have around 50 levels, most of the UI (as well as the options settings) is in place, the code structure is ready, we have an intro and most of the art, the 6h world with endless boss game-play is also almost finished. \nBuilding a level in unity!\n  And now? We need to design more puzzle levels and polish the game as well as tweaking the boss gameplay, fixing bugs and some UI issues.\nAnd the art style? Yeah, we love pixelart and imprint-X therefor is a 2D-game filled with super nice pixels!  We use a combination of pixelart, Lightening, shaders and gloom.\nimprint-X will be released for mobile and desktop at the same time.\nThe couple Morgondag; Vendela Carlberg Larsson and Kim Aarnseth\nVendela and Kim\nWe met in Stockholm 2012 and fell in love. We were both creative people. We both painted and designed. Kim also coded stuff and have a long programmer background. Vendela on the other hand wrote poetry and worked on several theater projects.   \nOne day we decided to create something together so we merged our different skills; games came out from that. \nSo, we began to make games, something neither of us had done before. We made many prototypes and minor games, our company Morgondag grew out from that and in 2013 we began to make our first bigger title; RymdResa. A game that we released on Steam in 2015.\nOur current workplace\n  Now our passion is our studio Morgondag and game development. Help us take over the world with our games by funding us! With your help we can work much faster! We need your support!\nThe music in imprint-X is made by the very talented sound designer and composer Tom Croke.

Note: The link provided is only tested to work on computers. \n------\nThe Mind Hero is to be something completely new. In addition to being a puzzle/platform/dating sim in which you go into the minds of six girls and two adults to save them, you'll also learn important psychological concepts in the background of the story as you do, and these can be taken away from the game and applied to real life.\nColven, 17, visits the lab where his mother and grandfather work, knowing his mother has gone unconscious after taking an experimental antidepressant. As it turns out, it was actually suppressing negative feelings and making them more powerful, and in addition to putting her and the other six girls who took it into a coma, there is a side effect that Colven can enter their minds simply by laying near them and focusing.\n He enters the mind of his mother, who is torn with grief about-- among other things-- the effect the antidepressant had on the other six girls. So to help free her from grief, Colven must go into their minds first to save all of them, which can be done in any order. He'll learn important things about psychology, have some fun, meet some danger, and gain some affection along the way.\nSome of the psychological concepts, as first presented by the late famous psychoanalyst Erik Erikson, are outlined within the video, while more will be presented within the game. You might be surprised after learning them all how they apply to you and those around you, and how helpful this knowledge might be to your life, even though the game will succeed as an immersively entertaining experience on its own.\nThe amount hoped for would finish making it possible, but anything extra would help to create content and to speed up the release as well.

As each star is consumed, people are discovering that this is a real threat. However, no one knows exactly what the Virus is, or has lived to tell about it.\n\nOn a routine mission for Zaos, you encounter an advanced warship. In the ensuing battle, both ships are destroyed and become bound together though a process called quantum entanglement.. The experience also binds you to an entity known as Ectype D-8. You quickly learn that there is more to this ship and A.I. that meets the eye.\n\nThe artificial intelligence is so advanced, she is able to absorb energy from other ships and duplicate them. As well as quantum burst, administer atmospheric regeneration, and of course...Omni Link.  You find out about these abilities as you play.\n\nOn your journey, you will meet dozens of interesting characters: Such as Dannon, a scientist claiming to be D-8's creator, Arcadia, a woman out of time with a dutiful mission as the last of her people.\n\nOther characters such as a pirate boss who's identity is unknown, you're buddy Slicer, a wealthy gangster, and the Arena champion are people who will shape your story. You will earn a bounty, and be hunted by more then just the Virus.\n\nYour choices in the game affect what happens to the story and gameplay in meaningful ways. What ships you acquire, who you save from the Virus threat, and what relationships of love, hate, and friendship you form. Who do you trust?\n            FEATURES:\nReal-time tactical combat\nChoices that affect gameplay and story in minor and large ways\nHuge two path end game split\nHand drawn character and background art\nEpic emotional music\n  WALLPAPER REWARD:\n(donate $5 or more to receive) *sample size\nSHIP DESIGN REWARD:\n100's of ready made designs when choosing a look, or we can give you some pieces to make your own.\n\nThen choose what standard weapon, ability, ship speed, armor, etc.. We'll leave it to your imagination, but don't go too crazy.\nI uploaded the demo so I could be open to you with what I'm going for. The story comes off a bit quick and with errors at the moment, but this will be fixed with professional help. I \"will not\" release the game until the story is pristine. You'll also notice many backgrounds are missing, there will be many more in the game.\nThanks for understanding and have fun.

We thus take into Mass Effect references, but we distinguish our project by his 2D cartoon style. We cover a broad range of topics that not be suitable for the younger audience. So we are developing this series with uncensored adult content that include nudity scenes.\nThe game will initially support PC / Mac and localized in French and English. We plan to add more platforms especially iOS and Android after the desktop version is released. We are also looking into the possibility of Steam and Console support and Linux but for now Unity 5 export is a little bit unstable and we will have to make some tests before, to be sure to provide you the best quality possible.\nEverything is interactive! The animations aim to be cartoonish, the caracters movements are not repetitives but in full adequacy with their environments.\nAll this with a nice dose of humor, violence and sex.\nYou'll be prompted to customize your spaceship in order to accommodate more people, expand your crew and so, open up new possibility, side quests and new places to explore.\nThis is a game about your choices and how they permanently affect their story.

Following your choices, some will become friends and others, all the contrary, will try to trick you. Each decisions, choices or dialogs would have it importance and will have heavy consequences in certain cases. Death lurks, waiting its next visit.\nAll in all, it is more than 40 to 60 NPC what are waiting you and with whom you will be able to interact and dialog with. It is more than 60 colorfull and animated backgrounds.\nStarFlint the Blackhole Prophecy is set in a futuristic world where humanity and the alien races coexist.\nWe were inspired by the science fiction movies from the 90's and 2000 as Firefly, Star Wars, H2G2, the fifth element, Gremlins, Back to the futur, Cowboy Bebop, where the characters are not all white or all black. They wear slinky outfits and where robots aned technologies are used for sciences, explorations and military fields.\nBy choosing this cartoon look, we discarded the heavy dramatic feel while keeping the originality and character related to science fiction. Our main cartoon inspiration are directly related to the point'n click game as The Curse Of Monkey Island, Day Of The Tentacle or the first episodes of the Broken Sword and games like Mass Effect. In addition, our game is intended for an adult audiences who does not want to be censored.\nThe cartoon look help us to enhance the feelings and the personalities of all our caracters. It help us to offer you animations in total adequacy with the surroundings and to manage lots of cutscenes in order to better tell you the story.\nWe want to create a real cartoon style animation games! Mixing the themes, we achive the artistic direction we desire for StarFlint the Blackhole Prophecy.\nSo why Kickstarter? Because we can\u2019t do it alone... We need you! We need the help of a larger community in order to realize the dream of producing StarFlint. Video gaming is our passion and the wonderful Kickstarter community offers the possibility of creating a broader and deeper story than we have the resources to craft on our own.\nFor the past two years we've been doing our best to provide the BEST quality graphic EVER by searching talents and professionals all around the WORLD! We sent a thousand emails ! From Russia to Brazil through Africa !\nWe believe in this project more than anything !! And for this, we did not hesitate to wet the shirt !\nWe have designed environments and characters, outlined the story and the game is ready to be brought to life.\nThis is the game we've always wanted to play as a gamer.

This would allow us to time to create final art, animation, sound, music, polish the game, and possibly add voice acting for a launch in Spring '17.\nThe game requires continued writing, storyboarding, design, game design, illustration, coding, modeling of sets, character rigging, character animation, sound design, music composition, and with the stretch goals, voice talent. All these things are needed to complete the game and this requires focus and time, critical luxuries as a freelancer. The initial goal will afford us these two opportunities. The higher stretch goals will open the doors to a fully realized version with all the bells and whistles.\nPaying Skilled and Passionate Artists - This is a passion project for us, but other friends and professionals need to be compensated for their tremendous talents.\nCompany and Operating Costs - Operating a business, Licensing, Equipment, Living Costs and Bills require a fair chunk of money and time.\nTesting, Refining, and Polishing - Beta testing, integrating Feedback from the Community and using everything that we have to produce a game we've been dreaming of for years.\nStunmason Games is a creative studio of French Canadian video games. Our goal is to release quality games that we will be proud of. We will bring a touch of glamor to our apps and a lot of dreams.

So, all the funds raised will only be used for the realisation, the improvement of the game and to pay the services of professionnals in fields that we do not master (Sounds, traductions, voice actings,...).\n\nTo minimise the risks, we have created Stunmason Games. A firme witch only goal is to realise Starflint. Doing so, we are able to pay less taxes and to only pay the accrued liabilities.\n\nEvery artists involved in the game are experienced in their fields. This knowledge and our analizes anable us to predict and anticipate all the aspects of the production. Our organisation is professionnal and we will fully respect the deadlines that we have set. Neither an artist nor a technician, I've managed a casino for nearly ten years in Montreal, Canada. I know how the respect a budget and avoid all unnecessary spendings/Costs. So I would be responsible for all administration and accounting. Another good point is that we do not work in an office which further reduces costs. All the money on the project really goes to basics.\n\nTo ensure a total success and a foolproof flexibility, we are using Unity 5 as video game engine. even if it doesn't need any introcuction, it is a powerful tool that allows us all fantasies at both animations and programming. The biggest benefits of using Unity are a trusted engine with a lot of 1st & 3rd\u00adparty support. More importantly, Unity is very flexible, and will make it much easier to support other platforms in the future including: iOS, Android, PS4, ONE...\n\nFinaly, Unity 5 is coded in C#/javascript, a code that is fully mastered by our developper for nearly ten years. There is a high probability to have multiple mini\u00adgames in StarFlint the Blackhole Prophecy.\n\nIn the end, with the minimum requested, we make sure we can achieve at least the game above an average level eventhough without achieving all our goals. Our most epic challenge will make you dream through the adventures of Trixie and Flint.\n\nNow, we are super thrilled and excited to announce the crowdfunding campaign of Starflint the blackhole prophecy hosted at kickstarter.com !

The main parts of all these games are the story telling and beautiful graphics. During my childhood, I drew a lot and never really lost addiction. Later - as a hobby writer - I wrote a couple of books, including Fantasy stories, a Mystery- and a distopic Thriller and a very funny story. For me, there had to be a way to combine both passions. Stories with interesting characters and hand made graphics.\nWindmill\nThis game takes place in a fantasy setting, where a young man called Nelson inherits a cabin from his deceased uncle Sid, not knowing, that the uncle was a necromancer during his lifetime. Most places in the game can be visited at day and night time, some of them only at night, where you can meet very interesting characters. There will be a lot of puzzles and crazy characters, including dead uncle Sid \u2013 who will appear as a ghost-, the stone cold undertaker, the confused baron, the soup-cooking witches, a group of game addicted skeletons and the vegan zombies.\nSo this will be a game of magic and a lot of humor \u2013 with many hidden jokes about other games and movies \u2013 as a homage, of course.\nFrom Sketch to Color\nThe prototype of the game has been created with Unity and the Adventure Creator Plugin.\nDuring the last two years, I did a couple of smaller game projects and prototypes with Unity. Last year, I released the digital version of a German board game on steam and on mobile platforms.\nFor my new adventure game I have to do a lot of drawing and animation work. This \u2013 including additional scripting - will be completely done by myself. The soundtrack and all the soundeffects will be created by a friend of mine, who created the music for my earlier projects.\nDepending on the stretch goals, the game could be released late 2017.\nVillage at night\nIf you support this game, you will receive a DRM free download for PC, Mac and Linux. There will be some further options for purchasing the soundtrack or a digital artbook. But you can also become a part of this game as a character by sending me a picture of you. I will draw a comic version of yourself and put you in the game.\nAnother interesting way of being a part of this adventure is to be a co-producer. Your name could be put in the credits and even in the intro of the game.\nThere are also some stretch goals including a talkie version and a complete novel \u2013 both in English and German. Mobile versions for iOS and Android could be possible, too. But this can only be done with your help.\nWindmill at night\nI need your support to create this classic point & click adventure game and I need your criticism, too. Please support \u201eNelson and the Magic Cauldron\u201c, to make a game possible, that we all love.\nThank you.\nCabin\n39000 \u20ac - Project funded\nThe game can be produced (for Windows, Mac and Linux) with all the content you love.\n49000 \u20ac - Voice recording / Talkie (English & German)\nA lot of studio work can be done with different voice talents.\n56000 \u20ac - Novel (English & German)\nI will write a complete novel of this story.

Planned release for the Playstation\u00ae4 is Q4 2016 while the Windows/OSX release is set for Q1 2017.\nWe've been Greenlit!\nFacebook | Twitter | Tumblr | Website\nWhen Hunter moves to the city of Commonsville from his small hometown of Sumtown, his life is turned upside down. The school is different, the people are different, and try as he might, Hunter can\u2019t seem to make any new friends.\nBut when he discovers a mysterious egg in the forest behind his new house, Hunter learns that friends can come in many shapes and sizes.\nBut not all the residents of Commonsville have friendship on their minds. Hunter\u2019s parents don\u2019t understand Rex and Hunter, desperate to keep his only friend, runs away with the hopes of returning to Sumtown.\nAnd when word spreads that Hunter has found a dinosaur, the shadowy figures at Bioneer Labs quickly set into motion plans to capture Hunter\u2019s newfound friend.\nWhat sinister plans does Bioneer Labs have for Rex? And who is the young, oddly-dressed girl Hunter keeps seeing lurking in the shadows? These mysteries and more will be solved as you join Hunter and Rex on their grand adventure!\nThe story of Me And My Dinosaur unravels over 30+ levels in its Story Mode, which can be played solo or with friends using the game\u2019s drop-in, drop-out local co-op feature.\nMap & level select screen.\nThe majority of the puzzles of Me And My Dinosaur revolve around the game\u2019s multiple characters and their various skills and limitations.\nAt the outset of the game, Hunter is capable of climbing on Rex\u2019s back to avoid obstacles and enemies, he can move objects, and he can jump. Rex, while being completely invulnerable to damage, is unable to squeeze into smaller areas and cannot jump.\nThe ancient temple's platform puzzle!\nUsing this information, we formulated the puzzles to exploit these strengths and weaknesses. We strove to design puzzles that would guide players through the various phases of puzzle solving: experimentation, identification, and application. We also wanted to give players a chance to explore puzzle mechanics in a variety of different scenarios, so that successfully solving a puzzle feels both natural and rewarding.\nAs the game progresses, the puzzles increase in complexity. To achieve the optimal difficulty curve, Me And My Dinosaur gradually introduces novel puzzle elements in the form of environmental obstacles, interactive objects, and perhaps most importantly, Dino Treats.\nDino treats and other items.\nThe Dino Treats are a group of items that allow Rex to perform special actions when used. With the exception of the Infinibone, Dino Treats are typically found hidden inside chests dispersed throughout the levels. In the Single-Player Story Mode, the Dino Treats will allow you to control both Hunter and Rex simultaneously. If a second player drops in with Local Co-op, the Dino Treats become disabled for the first player as the second player assumes direct control of Rex (though the Dino Treats still must be collected by Hunter to allow Rex to perform his special actions).\nThe Infinibone is a magic-imbued bone that allows Hunter to guide the ever-hungry Rex through the world. When you need Rex to follow you, just drop an Infinibone and he\u2019ll sprint towards it.\nJumping Beans are small, greenish beans that have a particular carbohydrate composition that is nearly indigestible for Rex. Encountered a ledge that Rex can\u2019t reach? Feed him a Jumping Bean, pinch your nose, and watch as his explosive toots propel him upwards.\nPyro Peppers are a variety of super spicy peppers with a mean heat of approximately 10 million Scoville heat units. Keep getting tangled in creeping vines? Feed Rex a Pyro Pepper and he\u2019ll belch up a potent fireball, scorching everything in his path.\nHunter also has access to other non-Rex-specific items that will help you solve puzzles in areas Rex can\u2019t enter. Rocks can be collected and thrown to activate switches, and bombs can be placed to destroy blockades.\nWhile most people would agree that Bioneer Labs is an undoubtedly evil organization, there is no denying that they have made tremendous breakthroughs with recombinant DNA. The scientists at Bioneer Labs have perfected their genetic splicing technique so as to extract the most evil aspects of various animals and plants and blend them together to create fearsome monsters. As such, the world of Me And My Dinosaur is peppered with all sorts of strange and dangerous creatures. Below are a few examples:\nTucked away in the hidden corners of Me And My Dinosaur\u2019s levels are collectable Dino Eggs, each containing an adorable Baby Dino for you to hatch, raise, and train in the Dino Daycare.\nIn order to level up your Baby Dinos, you\u2019ll need to feed them Dino Chow. At each level, your Baby Dino will crave a different type of Dino Chow. Depending on whether they are herbivorous, carnivorous, or omnivorous, they may want to munch on a mound of meat, tuck into a tasty tomato salad, or snack on a sweet snow cone!\nTo find ingredients to craft the various different types of Dino Chow, you\u2019ll need to play one of three dinotastic minigames in the Games Room.\nDino Dash\nGuide your chosen Baby Dino along a fast-paced obstacle course, picking up super-powered Dino Treats and dodging incoming enemies, in this addictive infinite runner. Survive for as long as you can to earn ingredients!\nDig Dig Dino\nExcavate the corridors of an ancient tomb with your Baby Dino in this confounding maze game. Collect power-ups and find your way to the exit of each stage within the move count to advance to the next area and earn ingredients!\nDinoMatrix\nMatch the numbers and shapes on randomly-generated tiles in this deceptively challenging puzzle game. Fill the grid to advance to the next level and earn more ingredients!\nFeed the Baby Dinos until they reach the maximum level and you\u2019ll unlock a special hat accessory to customize your prehistoric pals!\nWhile we do have some plans to provide players with free updates (such as new game modes and Dino Daycare minigames), we also plan on creating some purchasable DLC after release. This DLC will give players the opportunity to visually customize their game experience through packs of themed Rex skins, Dino Daycare packs (composed of new Baby Dinos, Dino Chow, and hats), and other content that we will be revealing during this Kickstarter campaign.\nAll of the artwork of Me And My Dinosaur has been painstakingly animated frame by frame. To support the storybook narrative, we opted for a bouncy, cartoonish style with vividly colourful environments and a cast of unique and quirky characters.\nCindy's run animation.\nHunter surfing on Rex!\nThe levels of Me And My Dinosaur explores many video game location staples: you\u2019ll sprint through busy city streets, crawl through dark caves, scale the ruins of an ancient civilization, tiptoe across lava flows, and slide across icy slopes.\nSome level art/layouts.\nWay back in 2011 when we first began work on Me And My Dinosaur, we turned to David Saulesco, a fantastic classical composer from Sweden, to help craft the game\u2019s soundtrack. The result? A bouncy, spritely soundtrack that reinforces the whimsical qualities of game\u2019s story with its strong, memorable melodies. With over 40 musical tracks, overlays, and musical stings, Me And My Dinosaur\u2019s soundtrack fully immerses you in the adventure. You can read a short article David wrote on our blog discussing the soundtrack here!\nIt\u2019s now been a few years since the original soundtrack and David has generously agreed to revisit some of the game\u2019s tracks, adding a pinch more polish and refinement. You can check out the comparison between the old and new Main Menu tracks below.\nFor the sound effects, we\u2019ve brought on Dave Chan as our lead audio expert. Dave\u2019s worked on some amazing games in the past including Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Mass Effect, and the upcoming The Long Dark.\nIf you watched our Kickstarter pitch video, you\u2019ll already have heard the sweet, dulcet tones of our voice actor Joshua Tomar. To reinforce the storybook narrative of Me And My Dinosaur, Josh will be reading the game\u2019s script in a manner similar to that of a parent telling a story to their child. Here\u2019s a sneak peek:\nFor the last three years, we at MADSOFT Games have been working diligently on Me And My Dinosaur. It has been both a phenomenal experience and a terribly expensive one. We\u2019ve invested thousands of manhours and a good chunk of our own money funding the game. And now, as we claw our way towards the development finish line, we need outside support.\nFund Allocation (sans Kickstarter and transfer fees).\nWe believe in Me And My Dinosaur. We believe in its timeless story of love and friendship, in its charming characters, and in its puzzle-solving, silky-smooth-platforming gameplay. And most of all, we believe that we can make the game even better with your support. Kickstarter provides us a unique opportunity to interact directly with our future players, take in feedback, and polish the game to a blinding sheen.\nMADSOFT Games is a small, independent game development and publishing studio based out of Edmonton, Alberta. Our team is composed of professionals with a virtual cornucopia of experience in the industry having worked for companies like BioWare, Juicy Beast, Hinterland Studio, THQ, Ubisoft, and KAOS.\nWith additional work by Josh Whelchel and Jose Jimenez III.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile the Me And My Dinosaur Kickstarter campaign isn\u2019t our first ride at the crowdfunding rodeo (we successfully published the first volume of our fantasy webcomic Aikonia using the Kickstarter platform way back in 2011), this is our first time using crowdfunding to fund the development of a video game.\n\nWhile we feel confident we will be able to produce a stellar final product, there are a few challenges we\u2019d like to address going forwards. Me And My Dinosaur will be our first foray into developing a console title as a team, which brings its own unique set of challenges (working within the hardware\u2019s limitations being our primary concern).\n\nThere is also a chance we might incur unexpected expenses and, with our small team, if anything radically awful were to happen to one of us (lightning strikes, volcano explosions, suddenly inexplicable loss of all fingers), meeting our deadline might be difficult.\n\nNevertheless, we are dedicated to finishing Me And My Dinosaur no matter the cost!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "MADSOFT Games, inc.\nFirst created \u00b7 3 backed\nAn independent game development & publishing studio in Edmonton, Alberta.See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #18", "update_userinfo": "Me, My Dinosaur, And Our Failed Kickstarter: A Crowdfunding Post-Mortem", "update_content": "Hey everyone!\nWe just posted our Kickstarter post-mortem on the MADSOFT Games blog!
