Moisture absorbed within the fabric allows these microorganisms to multiply exponentially, making your towel the most infected item in your bathroom.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe inspiration for our patent-pending Sanifabric technology comes from medical science. Antibacterial surfaces are one of the most essential technologies used in hospitals today. \n\n\n\n\nAfter years of research and development, we were finally able to implement the same material technology within a usable and durable fabric.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut don\u2019t just take our word for it. Sanitowel\u2019s antibacterial effectiveness has been independently verified by the world\u2019s largest testing company Intertek, using the international AATCC-100 standard. Sanitowel was also verified to maintain its effectiveness even after washing. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSanitowel has been tested by real people. Based on their feedback we aimed to create a towel that:\nDoesn't get musty\nDries faster\nRequires less washing\nFeels luxuriously soft\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter countless iterations, we finally created the perfect design. Here's what some of our users have to say:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtect your skin from infections, acne, redness, scarring, enlarged pores and other forms of permanent damage that unnecessarily contribute to aging. \n\n\n\n\nSanitowel keeps you protected and has been dermatologically certified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate the perfect ending to your everyday shower ritual by drying off with the most absorbent, soft and clean towel you\u2019ll ever use.

What's going on inside that fevered brain? We asked the ingenious animator Bill Plympton to help us investigate.\nWe've been mining Internet, TV, and radio archives for juicy Trump sound bites to inspire Plympton's surreal, hand-drawn animations.\nTrump Bites is the illegitimate offspring of Plympton's witty animations and Trump's witless pronouncements. \nWhere We Are Now\nOur first three episodes are now streaming on the New York Times. We'd like to make at least a dozen more.  \nHand-drawn animation is not cheap. Bill works with a team artists that includes a colorist, a compositor, an editor, and a sound designer -- each adding their talent and hard work to the finished product. And due to the sensitive nature of the content, our legal and insurance fees are substantial. To keep this series going, we need your help.\nThere are so many more Trumpisms that we're eager to spoof, and we welcome your suggestions in the comments section. Here are a a few that we are considering for future episodes:\n\u201cI would love to be a well-educated black\u2026\u201d Trump experiences the perks of being a black male in America.\n\u201cThe medical deferment is feet\u2026\u201d What exactly was the problem with Trump\u2019s feet that sidelined him during the Vietnam War?  We take you inside the exam room.\n\"We had the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake...\" Presidents Trump and Xi frolic in a chocolate dreamscape while missiles fly to \"Iraq... I mean Syria.\"\nThe Team \nBill Plympton (animator) has made over fifty films, receiving the Palme D'Or at Cannes and two Academy Award nominations;  Billy Shebar (series creator/producer) is an Emmy-nominated writer and filmmaker, whose screenplay for Dark Matter, starring Meryl Streep, won the Alfred P. Sloan Prize at Sundance; David C. Roberts (series creator/producer) is a former US diplomat turned writer/filmmaker whose work has appeared in the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.  Billy and David are co-founders of 110th Street Films.\nAdam Rackoff (consulting producer) is a frequent Plympton collaborator and the co-founder of Cinco Dedos Peliculas with actor Matthew Modine (Full Metal Jacket, Stranger Things). Evan Shapiro (consulting producer) is an Emmy-nominated producer and former President of Pivot, IFC TV, and the Sundance Channel. Peggy Stern (consulting producer) won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short as producer of The Moon and The Son (2005).\nWendy Cong Zhao is our compositor and editor; Sandrine Plympton is our colorist; Weston Fonger is our sound designer; Miles Shebar is our creative strategist; Michael Richard Martin shot our Kickstarter video; Neil J. Rosini (Franklin, Weinrib, Rudell & Vassallo) is our attorney.\nHow You Can Help\nIt costs $20K per episode to do these right, so we're asking for $60K to do at least three more. Should we be lucky enough to exceed our goal, we'll put the money toward additional episodes. Top distribution outlets have already shown interest, so there\u2019s a wide audience eager to see them, but we want to stay independent and true to our vision. This can only happen with your help.\nWe're offering some tantalizing rewards for our contributors, from Bill's original drawings and storyboards to your (animated) appearance in one of our episodes.\nIf you'd rather get a tax deduction, you can donate to our project via Fractured Atlas, a non-profit arts service organization.  \nFor anyone interested in making a major contribution, we'd love to discuss ways to recognize you in our on-screen credits. Please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out for more details.\nThe Way Kickstarter Works\nKickstarter is all or nothing \u2013 so if we don\u2019t reach our initial goal of $60,000 by midnight (EST) on July 25, we won\u2019t get any money, and no one's credit card will be charged. Please help us out by contributing whatever you can, and sharing this project as widely as you can.  Every dollar helps, and every share helps. Thank you for your support! \nRewards Gallery", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur biggest challenge is to rise above the noise of the Internet to connect with the large audience that we believe is out there for this series, and to raise the money necessary to keep it going. We have a great team, and the New York Times's enthusiasm is proof that, with proper funding, Trump Bites will snowball. \n\nOur biggest risk is getting sued. These short films are no-holds-barred parodies of real Trump audio. We have hired a top lawyer, Neil Rosini, who has diligently prepared for any eventuality. We have also obtained insurance to mitigate the remaining risk.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "EXCLUSIVE UPDATES", "descp": "Get the latest updates on the making of TRUMP BITES.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2018"}], "stat": ["51 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "DESKTOP IMAGE & TWITTER SHOUT-OUT", "descp": "You\u2019ll receive a high-res TRUMP BITES desktop image for your computer and Bill Plympton (@plymptoons) will follow and thank you from his verified Twitter account.

And who is J.R. \"Bob\" Dobbs? And why is his name always in quotes? And for nonbelievers, why has this strangely compelling parody religion, this long-running postmodern joke, caught the attention of such pop culture icons as Rachel Maddow, Nick Offerman, Jon Stewart, David Letterman, Pee-wee Herman (Paul Reubens), David Byrne, Robert Crumb, Richard Linklater, Alex Cox, Ken Kesey, Frank Zappa, Jonathan Demme, and Devo\u2019s Mark Mothersbaugh? And is it true that Tori Amos is also one of \"Bob\"\u2019s chosen?  \n\"Bob\" and the Church have caught the attention of many\u2013 include David Byrne, Pee-wee Herman (Paul Reubens), Tori Amos, Stephen Colbert, Robert Crumb, Mark Mothersbaugh and DEVO, Matt Groening, Margaret Moser, Rachel Maddow, Nick Offerman, and more.\nARE WE CONTROLLED BY SECRET FORCES? ARE ALIEN MONSTERS BRINGING A STARTLING NEW WORLD? DO PEOPLE THINK YOU\u2019RE STRANGE? DO YOU? \nThe Church of the SubGenius: The Early Years\n\u201cWe tied together every occult, superstitious fringe belief you could think of\u2026it was so much fun!\u201d\n\u2013 Ivan Stang, co-founder\nBorn into the suburban world of the 1950s, future founders of the Church of the SubGenius Reverend Ivan Stang (Douglass St. Clair Smith) and Dr. Philo Drummond (Steve Wilcox) come of age during the 1960s and 70s \u2013 a time of unprecedented social and political tumult. They experience the rise of a deafening consumer culture, the tarnishing of the \"American Dream,\" the violence of the Vietnam War abroad, and the Kennedy assassinations and conspiracies that follow. \nAs youths they revel in the delights of stable families, monster movies, Science Fiction, super-8 moviemaking, dinosaur figures, comic books, and Rock 'n' Roll. As they grow older they witness the emergence of televangelism, the Jonestown Massacre, punk culture, and Reaganomics.\nDespite both growing up in Texas, it was not until the mid 70s that Stang and Drummond meet and quickly forge a friendship over a shared love of comic books, Captain Beefheart, and UFO paperbacks. One not so particular eve in 1977, while bemoaning their lack of conventional \u201csuccess\u201d for two such intelligent, well read chaps, Stang remarks, \u201cWell, we\u2019re not exactly geniuses.\u201d To which Drummond replies, \u201cyeah, we\u2019re sub-geniuses.\u201d \nAnd in that moment the Church of the SubGenius is born. It is not long after that J.R. \"Bob\" Dobbs reveals himself as the Church's iconic prophet and foremost patron of ineffable Slack. In fact, Stang and Drummond will later come to the realization that \"Bob\" has been planting evidence of his presence for them for the past twenty years!!!\nTHE SUBGENIUS DIASPORA\n\u201cThere was that moment of realizing that this thing goes further than I ever imagined.\u201d\n\u2013 Puzzling Evidence (Doug Wellman)\nIn late 1979 Stang and Drummond, with the help of their wives, brainstorm what would become perhaps the single most significant marketing effort made at the inception of the Church of the SubGenius \u2013 the writing, design, printing, and distribution of Pamphlet #1. The doctrine of the Church quickly spreads, and the word of \u201cBob\u201d and the teachings of JHVH-1 teach \u201ctime control\u201d as a way to wrest \u201cSlack\u201d from the \u2018Pinks\u2019 and \u2018Normals.\u2019 The Church, it seems, has struck a nerve amidst the deadening consumer culture, the evisceration of basic social services, and the worship of wealth that occurred during the Reagan/Thatcher years.\nL: An early years Devival | R: The Three Wise Guys \u2013 Ivan Stang, Dr.X and Philo Drummond \u2013 pose with a Model X Humanoid (1979)\nAs \u201cBob\u201d\u2019s pamphlet continues to travel the world, the emergent punk publishing scene and new wave comic writers seize on the humor and cultural critique of the Church's doctrine. In San Francisco it is fished out of a trashcan by cartoonist and artist Paul Mavrides, igniting a SubGenius cell that gives the movement some of its most enduring art and performances through LIES (Paul Mavrides), Dr. Howland Owl (Hal Robins), Puzzling Evidence (Doug Wellman), Janor Hypercleats and Pope Sternodox. \n\"Bob\" captures the zetigeist of the day. Cartoonist Robert Crumb reprints Pamphlet #1 in the first issue of his comic Weirdo. A few years later Simon and Schuster publishes The Book of the SubGenius.  Acclaimed film director and SubGenius Alex Cox channels Church mythology in Repo Man as the glowing, alien-owned Chevy Malibu soars high above Los Angeles with Otto (Emilio Estevez) and Miller (Tracy Walke) inside, their faces shining with Slack as Bud (Harry Dean Stanton) watches from below. \nDr. Howl and Puzzling Evidence conduct legendary \u201cDevivals,\u201d radio shows (More than an Hour, Less than a Show), and introduce the word of \"Bob\" to Burning Man. The Stark Fist of Removal newsletter, The Hour of Slack podcast, an MTV special, and countless cassette tapes, posters, comics, videos, websites, and Facebook groups perpetuate the word of \"Bob.\" \nBy the turn of the century, publications as powerful as TIME Magazine begin to get the SubGenius joke when \u201cBob\u201d is voted \u2018Fraud of the Century\u201d by readers of its online poll. In the late 90\u2019s and early 2000\u2019s, the \u201cFree Party\u201d constituents of Brighton in Great Britain voted \u201cBob\u201d Dobbs as an M.P. to the House of Commons three times.\nToday, \u201cBob\u201d\u2019s hucksterism and the wisdom of JHVH-1 is apparent in all fifty states and a multitude of countries across the globe!\nPLAY\n\nAnother early SubGenius of Texas, David Boone (late husband of Slacking Towards Bethlehem director Sandy K. Boone), documents the rise of the SubGenius in his 1980 film, Invasion of the Aluminum People, which is lauded by Academy Award winning director Jonathan Demme. This is one of the first known recorded instances of the transmission of SLACK.\nGIVE TO THIS KICKSTARTER NOW AND ACHIEVE SALVATION \u2013 OR TRIPLE YOUR MONEY BACK!!!!!!\nOnly with your support can our intrepid group of award-winning filmmakers dare to make this film. By giving us your hard earned cash, we can make this dream a reality, and breach all Earthly human, political, and cultural barriers with the searing nonhuman truth of the Word of \"Bob,\" J.R. \"Bob\" Dobbs, that LIVING GOD WHO WALKS THIS PLANET EARTH IN HUCKSTER'S SHOES. \nTo date, we\u2019ve travelled over 8,000 miles and interviewed 15 SubGenius in four cities, sharing the so-called \"reality\" that SubGenii are forced to share with humans. We\u2019ve only just begun to uncover many of the SubGenius\u2019 most guarded secrets. The SubGenii are finally willing to go public and tell the TRUTH. \nThis is YOUR chance to get in on the ground floor of a huge, globally important cult. You will then attract all the $$$, pleasure spacecraft, and SHEER POWER OVER OTHERS that go with high-ranking support of the Church and this documentary! \nBut most important, you can smite your enemies, achieve TIME CONTROL and attain SLACK.\nREMEMBERING SAINT MARGARET\nSince we began production on our film, a beloved avatar of the early SubGenius tribe, Margaret Moser, passed away on August 25 of this year. One of the nation\u2019s top music journalists and music scene nurturers, Reverend Reverend Doctor Doctor Archdoctor Saint Margaret Moser even had a photo of J.R. \u201cBob\u201d Dobbs on her Austin Chronicle business card. She said it helped her connect with her interview subjects, many of whom were already members of the Church themselves.\nPLAY\n\nIn her interview with us, she spoke about the pleasure, \u201cthe great release, to have all this nutty stuff in your head and find like minded people to express it with.\u201d But most notably she sang a song written by her own hand, \"Oh, Life's a Bowl of Cherries with \"Bob\" Dobbs.\" Saint Moser's life epitomized the way that membership in the Church accelerated the discovery of true friendships, experimentations, creative collisions, and rebellion through art, music, and comedy against dehumanization in any form.\nWHY THIS FILM? \nWhy not this film? Pull the wool over your own eyes and help us make a movie! The Church of the SubGenius is the underground movement that has galvanized the imaginative, the artistic, the nerdy, even the deranged \u2013 to examine the simmering dystopia in their culture, and do absolutely nothing about it... except, maybe, poke fun at it all. The Church of the SubGenius is taking over the universe. The sooner you learn about it, the better off you\u2019ll be. \nPLAY\n\nNow more than ever we feel that the story of the Church of the SubGenius needs to be told. There's a core of ideas within the SubGenius ethos \u2013 of fighting oppression with humor, community and creativity, of using absurdity as a nonviolent weapon, giving time, permission and priority to expression, creation, and zaniness with friends \u2013  that we think has great value we believe these ideas are necessary in today's world and that our film about the SubGenius is the perfect way to invoke them.\nAmongst all the spaceships, frop, pipes, eye-bludgeoning graphics, bulldada, yeti ancestors, (and yes, \u2018macho spoutings\u2019), we hope you will fund this film so you can join our merry band of pranksters on the culture-jam of the century!

We make it up as we go along.\u201d\nIvan Stang hosts the 999 Club (1981)\nWHAT WILL THE FUNDS BE USED FOR?\nWith this funding, we can complete the remaining interviews, edit the film, animate key sequences, and all other post-production work necessary to bring this ridiculous story to the masses.\nA behind the scenes look at our film production.

What could I design for $1 that would speak to the millions of Kickstarter backers that could equal the value of receiving a heartfelt (canned) \"Thank You\" with their $1 pledge?  And then it hit me!\nWHAT ABOUT A $1 GAME THAT THEMATICALLY APPROXIMATES THE ACTIONS AND FEELINGS OF PLEDGING $1 AND GETTING A \"THANK YOU\" E-MAIL!!??  \nAnd alas...\nWhy just get a \"Thank You,\" when you can get a GAME?\n...was born!\nIn mere hours I had completed every aspect along the path to creating a board game: brainstorming, sketching, designing, prototyping, looking up Rotten Tomatoes reviews on upcoming movies, testing, game-balancing, more testing, drinking a Coke Zero or two and finally the finalization of the final finished product:\nDELUXE version shown with PRACTICALLY REAL, BUT NOT ACTUALLY REAL $1 Pledge component!\nSo now there's naught left to do but print it, pack it and send it out to any and all of you who truly desire to have a board game that represents that feeling you get when you spend $1 to back a project at the \"Thank You\" level.  (Scroll down for gameplay video)\nThis project only needs TEN(10) $1 backers to be successful.\nSo please, won't you consider being one of those ten people? \nYou WON'T get my thanks.  You WILL get A GAME!\n$1 Pledge level can go ANYWHERE!!!!\nSTRETCH GOALS!!\nJust like any great Kickstarter project, The Obligatory $1 Pledge Level Board Game has several stretch goals that will be unlocked should we reach total pledge levels above and beyond the $10 project funding level!\nRULES REFERENCE ON THE BOARD!

We\u2019re Alex and Jonny, the co-founders of One Third Stories. We're on a mission to inspire more children to love and learn foreign languages. But we can't do that without your help.\nWe want to make learning a language as simple as reading a story. That means creating a beautiful hardback book that starts in English and ends in a different language by gradually introducing foreign words in easy-to-understand contexts. \nA mock-up of the book featuring Hannah Hutchings' incredible artwork\nYou can make that dream a reality by pledging your support. There's a whole load of rewards you can get in return, from a copy of the finished book to voting on your favourite story ideas and helping to shape what we're creating. Even just taking a moment to tell your friends about the campaign would be amazing!\nIt's no secret that languages are pretty amazing. They can improve our minds, give us better career prospects, and help us see the world. Imagine getting all those benefits in childhood!\nBut lots of kids just aren\u2019t getting a good start when it comes to learning languages. Remember the verb tables, the textbooks stuffed full of grammar and the \u2018label everything in your pencil case\u2019 activities? They're still out there and they're still making kids dread their French lessons.\nThe trouble is that lots of our fantastic teachers are expected to teach foreign languages when they haven\u2019t been trained to do so. Some parents try and help out at home but that can be tricky because they don't speak another language themselves.\nThe result of all this is that 58% of adults in the UK regret not learning another language when they were younger. That number is only set to get bigger as a whole generation miss out on the gift of another language.\nWe want to change all of this by combining language education with entertainment. That's why we're making a beautiful hardback book for kids, illustrated by the incredibly talented Hannah Hutchings.\nIt's designed to help parents and teachers who don't speak another language themselves support their children. It also makes learning a language so enjoyable that the kids will be excited to learn more!\nA mock-up of the book featuring Hannah Hutchings' incredible artwork\nInitially, we were only planning to make three versions of the book; one to teach French, one for Spanish, and one for Italian. Thanks to the support of the Goethe-Instiut, the organisation responsible for promoting the German culture and language worldwide, we're delighted to announce that we're going to be making a German version too! If you're interested in purchasing this version, just pledge at the reward tier you fancy and we'll send you a survey at the end of the campaign asking which language version you'd like.\nWe're also creating an accompanying app - a digital version of the story with narration from a native speaker of each language.\nThe story itself is all about a little girl who goes outside in a storm to rescue a cat and has all of her words blown away. On her adventure to get them all back, she learns all sorts of new words in a different language.\nWe know children are going to love this story because over 1500 of them have helped to write it! We took their brilliant ideas and turned them into characters in the book.\nThroughout the story, we use The Clockwork Methodology\u00ae, which we created to make learning a language as easy and enjoyable as possible for kids. Here's how it works...\nThe Clockwork Methodology\u00ae works because it helps children learn a new language in the same way that they expand their vocabulary in their native tongue.\nMixing languages like this might seem strange, but it's not uncommon amongst bilingual people. It's called code switching and studies have shown that exposing children to it can actually have cognitive benefits as they develop strategies to process all that input. \nWe\u2019re Alex and Jonny, the co-founders of One Third Stories. We\u2019ve been friends for over 8 years now, and a big chunk of that time has been spent trying to revolutionise the way children learn languages.\nThat journey started when we were still at school. We set up a Young Enterprise company with some other friends and made a book about a penguin and a little girl who travelled the world learning languages. Parents and kids loved it but we stopped to focus on our A-levels.\nFast-forward a few years, and Alex was busy learning his fourth language, whilst Jonny was studying how children acquire languages at university. It suddenly occurred to us that we had the skills to reinvent our project with The Clockwork Methodology\u00ae and make a brand new story!\nYup. That's Alex in the penguin suit.\nWhy is this project so important to us? Because languages are absolutely amazing and all children deserve the chance to learn them! Alex found this out first hand growing up bilingual in Paraguay. Languages have given him the chance to see the world, make friends all over the place, and resulted in some really exciting career opportunities. \nFor Jonny, it was a bit different. Neither of his parents could speak another language and he hated the lessons at school. It was only when he grew up and got the chance to travel that he felt he\u2019d missed out on all the benefits of languages and started learning French again.\nOne picture that says everything you need to know about Alex and Jonny's differing attitudes to language learning\nWe\u2019re on Kickstarter because we want to make sure that children get a great start in language learning so that they don\u2019t end up regretting missed opportunities like Jonny does. We want them to grow up learning about other cultures and making international friends and discovering all the other benefits that a second (or third or fourth or even fifth!) language can bring.  \nHere are a few of the things we're offering as rewards to people who pledge their support in this Kickstarter campaign. Don't forget to keep an eye out for EARLY BIRD OFFERS to get a great discount on the book!\n Here's an example of the sort of thing you can expect from one of our puppet shows...\n ...and a sneak peak at some of the postcards on offer...\n\"Mini me loves this book and he didn\u2019t even notice that I was saying some words in Spanish. It\u2019s definitely a fun and easy way to introduce a new language.\" \nLyndsey Edwards - parent, blogger & home educator \n\"This is such a fab idea, and feels like a very natural way of learning new vocabulary...It's so much better than endlessly reciting the same thing over and over again, the way so many forays into language learning begin.\"\nJessica Powell - parent & blogger\n\"We all know how much our children love stories. By combining stories and languages, they will inspire more children to love languages too.\"\nNathalie Paris -  Languages teacher at St Mary's RCVA in Durham\n\"As the story went on and more Spanish words crept in he did question it but was still able to follow what was happening in the story. He\u2019s been repeating his new Spanish words ever since!\"\nEmma Easton - parent & blogger\n\u201cTheir stories are amazing! The kids and myself have enjoyed trying them out in lessons, and I think parents and kids will love them as bedtime stories.\u201d\nBenjamin Currier- Languages teacher at Mayfield School in Portsmouth\n And then, of course, there's our favourite bit of feedback so far...\nHere's a quick look at how we'll be spending the money and our timeline for completing the project.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019ve been working towards this project for over a year and have done everything possible to minimise the risks involved. \n\n- We\u2019ve found a printer who will produce the books to a high standard and make sure they get delivered all over the world promptly. \n\n- We\u2019ve given ourselves plenty of time to send out the books and fulfil the other rewards by Christmas. \n\n- We\u2019re working with Hannah Hutchings, a ridiculously talented illustrator with heaps of experience, so we know the book is going to look amazing.\n\n- We\u2019re getting advice from senior people in the publishing industry to make sure we can tackle any issues before they even arise. \n\n- We\u2019re using a special piece of software for the app design which allows us to produce it much faster than a normal app.\n\nThank you so much for your support!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #23", "update_userinfo": "Exclusive One Third Stories Christmas Book! \ud83c\udf84", "update_content": "Hey Kickstarter backers! \nWe\u2019re happy to say that the books are finally on their way!

In order to secure victory, the players must cultivate a well balanced nation. One rich in technology, settlements & farms, markets & exotics, as well as, temples & sacred sites.\nIn this 2 -4 player game (4 with Tribe IV tier), the players find themselves submerged in a visually stunning, abstract world of epic high fantasy; a vast and expansive world, set at the very dawn of civilization.\nAs newly ascribed tribal leaders, the players are challenged with all of the difficulties which burden any great leader --Where to call home...who to conquer...when to make peace...\nHere's a series of videos about Mark's experiences with the demo game:\nCheck out this pre/review of the demo game by Daniel at Spelkult:                    \n_________________________________________________________\nCheck out this video pre/review of the demo game by Michael at NVS Gameplays:\n_________________________________________________________\n\"In our play of the game, we found it easy to follow the rules and we quickly developed strategies for controlling territories.\"\n-Dan (Guild Master Gaming, read his full review of the demo game here)\n________________________________________________________\n\"Just played the PNP demo with my daughter.

My friends and I had a great time playing Civicus. It was fun, interesting, and engaging. I thought the game did a nice job of incorporating a civ-builder theme into a microgame. Although the game featured a high degree of randomness due to the dice rolling mechanic, I never felt as if I was lacking options on my turn. This was due primarily to the technology advancement, which was my favorite part of Civicus.

I've yet to be let down.   \nI was introduced to the series via the traditional sized board game [Civicus: Origin Myth]. Upon my first play through I was blown away.    \nWill showed me the smaller dice game shortly after. I was initially taken back. Bigger is better, right? I was mistaken. I now understand why he saved Civicus Dice Game for last.\nYou will not find a game with more value per square inch than this one. It retains many of the mechanics that make the larger game great: empire building, competition for the resources necessary to fuel your empire, the chess-like strategy, the element of choosing whether your empires grow side by side in relative harmony, or whether you will plot and scheme your way to total dominance.\nAs a bonus, it adds a Yahtzee-like dice element, that in one roll can force you to question even the most well laid plans, and quickly adapt to the present situation.\nThe best part is that you can carry a game with all the things that make big games great, in your pocket. No lugging out a big box, setting up a big board, etc.\nPlay it in the car on a road trip, on a lunch break, outdoors...anywhere.\nMost travel sized games are dumbed down, shadows of their original selves.

That being said, we have decided to build US shipping into the price of the game (meaning that US backers will not be required to pay an additional fee). US shipping rates are approximately $6, so to be fair, all international backers will get a $6 discount on shipping (e.g. CA backers would normally pay $16, however, we are only charging an extra $10--all other international backers will pay only $20 in shipping fees).\nIf you are interested in buying as a group, and/or as a retail package, let us know, we would be happy to add another reward tier.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any great endeavor, many challenges will present themselves. In order to mitigate these challenges, we have spent the last two years studying the methods of those who have walked the path before us. This has proven invaluable!\n\nSpecifically, we anticipate that fulfillment will present many logistical challenges. To counter this, we will be calling upon the knowledge of a few of our dearest mentors. \nFirst, we will be consulting with a long time family friend, who has been manufacturing fishing lures since the late seventies. His expertise and specialized knowledge has, and will continue to strengthen our ability to overcome any manufacturing/fulfillment challenges that may come up along the way (thank you John!).\n\nSecond, we have a retired, ex-marketing representative (for a major beverage company), and successful entrepreneur friend who has proven an invaluable source of marketing knowledge (thanks Craig!).\n\nThird, we have been tapping into the game industry knowledge of Marcelo Figueroa (Golden Distribution), since 2009, when we first attended GAMA trade show! Marcelo is a wealth of game industry knowledge--check out his video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZF6YiB3pvbo (Thank you Marcelo!)\n\nCollectively, we have more than 100 years of experience to draw upon in order to make this happen in a streamlined, and efficient manner.

Unfortunately, humanity was no match for its own creations and armies of terrifying monsters were soon out of control in their destruction of civilization. In their final global nuclear strike, humanity accomplished only two things: They wiped themselves out, and they created a highly mutagenic environment where the monsters could thrive.\nThis is the world at the start of a game of Teratozoic. (From greek: terato-, of or relating to monsters, -zoic, of a (specified) era, or having a (specified) animal mode of existence.) Each player has their own deck of monster parts (their Gene Pool), and will attempt to make the best of the mutations they draw from a common deck to come out on top in the battle for survival. At first your monsters will be more random mutation than representative of a stable gene pool (players will draw most of the cards for each hand from the common deck), but by the time you reach the Teratozoic Era your monsters will be built entirely from the best traits you retained in each generation. The dominant species in this new era (the final winner of the game) will be the one with the most robust gene pool\u2014the player who can create the biggest, most impressive monsters at the end of the Teratozoic Era.\nGame contents:\n7 Era cards\n96 Monster-part cards, each with a unique illustration:\nStarting monsters \u2013 36 cards\nBasic cards \u2013 36 cards\nAdvanced cards \u2013 24 cards\n6 Reference cards (player aids)\nA rule book\nEach player starts with a deck of 6 cards, their 'Gene Pool', which they will gradually expand and improve over the course of the game. Each generation (one round of play), every player will draw cards in part from a deck of 'Random Mutations' (a common deck) and in part from their own deck; at the beginning of the game each hand is mostly random, but as play progresses the randomness is reduced until during the last 'Era' of play all cards are drawn from players' Gene Pools. \nAfter declaring whether they're playing all (or only some) of their cards, all players build monsters from their cards at the same time. Whoever's monsters score the highest 'dominates the generation' and they get both to gain more cards than the other players and to pick from among all played cards while other players may only choose cards which came from their own hands.\nAt the end of the game, all players will assemble their entire Gene Pool into up to three of the largest single-color monsters (with no loose ends) they're able (one of each color: orange, purple, & green) and the player who uses the most cards in their monsters is the winner. This means that winning the game depends not just on winning as many hands as possible (requiring the highest-scoring cards and rewarding the highest number of cards), but also paying enough attention to the cards gained (especially in lost generations) to ensure the right number of connections of the right colors end up in a player's Gene Pool.\nWith no discrete currency, plenty of player interaction & simultaneous play, plus the fun of putting together whimsical monsters every turn, Teratozoic is unlike any deck-building game you've seen before\u2014and it's light enough that it could be used as a gateway game or enjoyed by younger players.\nDownload the rules (PDF) \u2013 This is the Preview version (v0.9.0) of the rules included in the Print-and-Play edition of Teratozoic. (The full PnP PDF is available below.) After the project is funded, I am planning to have the physical versions of the game include a 3.5x5\" rule book containing the same information, but laid out to fit that format. (I've been working on updating and revising the PDFs of the Preview Edition of the 3.5x5\" rule book (updated to v0.9.5 on 8/9, now includes cover w/interior)\u2014I welcome any feedback that can continue improve the clarity of the final rule book, from rearranging sections (which may not be possible, due to printing constraints) to simple re-writing; this is my first game-rule-book of this size & scope, and I appreciate the help.)\nHow-To-Play Video \u2013 Many people will have an easier time understanding the basic flow of the game by seeing it played than they would by reading the rules, so I've put together a rough video (only about 8 minutes long!) which shows and explains the basics of an entire game of Teratozoic:\n Get the Game:\nThis is the main point of the project, the tier that gets you a copy of the game. If you aren't interested in designing custom cards or having your favorite monster painted, pledge $20. There is no discount for ordering multiple copies available, and won't be unless we reach a significant production volume.\nI also have a few copies of the Preview Version of Teratozoic left over, which I'll be able to ship out immediately after funding clears Amazon. I produced these with the same printers/suppliers I'll be using for between about 50 and 1,000 copies of Teratozoic, so they are substantially identical to the final game. These are the same copies I've been sending to reviewers and using to preview the game at cons and local game stores, and are what you see in all the photos and videos on this page. You might pledge at this level because you want to support the project more but can't afford $99+, or because you want to start playing as soon as possible.\nA Little Less:\nIf you want to help get Teratozoic published, but aren't sure the game is for you (or if you can't justify the international shipping surcharges for a light card game), you can pledge at these levels and earn my gratitude, or just to join the conversation and get your foot in the door so you can decide later whether to increase your pledge. \nThe following download links will get you a copy of the current Print-and-Play version of Teratozoic for free. If you can't afford to pledge $20+, or if you want to give the game a try before pledging, you're welcome to download a copy. If you like the game, or just want to show your gratitude for getting a free copy of the game, please consider pledging at least $1.\nHere's the link to the: Teratozoic Print-and-Play PDF (Full color) (v0.9.1)\nAnd the link to the: Teratozoic Print-and-Play PDF (B&W / low-ink) (v0.9.1)\nIf you pledge at the $5 level, I'll semi-randomly select (at least) 5 cards from among my many prototype decks, ensuring they come together to create (at least) one interesting monster with no loose ends, and mail them to you as soon as the funds clear Amazon. (Early September.) Some of these cards will be identical to those in the final version of the game, but most of them are close-but-not-quite-there. I have prototypes in four different card stocks from three different printers, and several iterations of the game have been produced on my preferred card stock by my preferred printer but have different backs, or lack the Color Symbols, or other small differences. The monsters are almost all the same, though, with the same set of illustrations. I'll ask your preferred color (purple, orange, or green) on the backer survey, and will do my best to get you a monster in that color but may not be able to match every request. (If, say, everyone requests one color; only a third of the cards are each color, so two-thirds of everyone will be disappointed in that unlikely scenario.)\nOriginal Artwork:\nWhen pledging at the $99 and $399 tiers, backers will be able to select any individual monster-part card or assemble a monster from several cards, and I will do my best to paint it for them on an 8x10\" canvas for the $99 level or on a canvas of the size of their choosing, up to about 24x36\", at the $399 level. Only a small monster (a couple of cards' worth) will fit on the small canvas, but if you pledge at the $99 tier and decide later you want a more elaborate monster you'll be able to send me the difference in price and get the large painting (after I've delivered everyone else's). The following is an example of a small monster which the buyer wanted a small (8x10\") painting of:\nThe delivery estimate for the art is a year away (Summer 2015) not just because I expect it to take me a while to paint everyone's monsters, but because I don't expect backers to get their games/cards until November/December or later, and I want them to have time to play the game a while before picking the monster they want painted. (If you print the PnP & know what you want right away, I can certainly get started on your painting sooner!) In the event delivery of the game slips (say, due to high volume), it's likely that not all original paintings will be delivered on time. If the hand-painted-monster tiers sell out, I'll add additional tiers with later delivery dates.\nHere's another Small Hand-Painted Monster I just did (7/30) for one of the backers (totally trusting them not to cancel their pledge!), which is a slightly-larger 11x14\" size\u2014see Update #4 for more details:\nI've seen a lot of projects in the Tabletop Games category with stretch goals which improve the quality of components, but Teratozoic will not be one of them; I've already found and selected the best quality components available and appropriate for the game. If fewer than 1,000 copies are needed, they'll be DriveThruCards' Premium cards (Arjo-Wiggins Playper 305gsm matte with blackcore layer), and if we exceed that number, the overseas manufacturer I've been in contact with will use the same exact card stock\u2014if the project is wildly more successful than that, I certainly won't consider anything lower quality. Also, again under ~1k copies, the boxes will be double-deck tuck boxes from the highest quality POD printer I could find, printed on their stiffest board (14pt), while my overseas manufacturer will give only slightly better results and slightly thicker board (15pt). For the rules I went through several options during development but the highest-quality option I could find was having 3.5x5\" rule booklets printed, so that's what I'm including in the game; I could have gone with the cheaper option of 11x17\" color copies, folded down to fit the tuck boxes, but as with seeking out the best color reproduction, printing, card stock, and box, I only want Teratozoic to be the best I can offer.\nConsequently, there are no stretch goals for this project.\n((In an earlier iteration, the game only featured 2 main colors of monsters. I was thinking the orange monsters (and support for a 5th & 6th player) would be an expansion/add-on, and further thought I'd make it a stretch goal (among many considered stretch goals) to add the expansion to everyone's reward. As with the quality of components (explained above) I decided to do what's best for the game and include all 3 main colors of monsters with every copy. It gives more variety, makes the game more fun, and does so even if the campaign gets a mere $2k in pledges.))\nI'm planning on personally shipping every copy by USPS, and I've included the cost of domestic shipping in every tier. I am not planning on paying extra for tracking. (We could make that a stretch goal, if backers demand it.) I've calculated the cost of shipping to dozens of countries and can afford to ship everywhere from Australia and Brazil to the EU and Asia for roughly $10 more than it costs me to ship domestically.\nIf you are ordering multiple copies internationally, please add $25 (total) for each additional copy of the game\u2014the first copy of Teratozoic is $20 + $10 shipping, and each additional copy is $20 + $5 shipping. (If this isn't clear, please comment or message me with where you are and what you want to pledge for, and I'll add it up for you!)\nIf you are interested in pledging for an original monster painting but live outside the US, please message me with the details; we may be able to work something out. The small painting will be a lot easier than a large painting; international shipping of large boxes adds up very quickly. Please DO NOT pledge for a painting to be shipped outside the US without messaging me first.\nWhat game reviewers are saying about Teratozoic:\n\"At first you\u2019ll think it\u2019s just about scoring the most points, and then you think it\u2019s about making the best monsters each round, but finally you realize it\u2019s all about gathering just the right amount of pieces so you can form the perfect monster and go out with a bang! Teratozoic ended up being more fun than I thought after the first game.\" \u2013 Griff, Dice. Card. Go!\n\"The rules are super easy to grasp, and can be read as you play your first game. I was able to teach my 2 oldest kids how to play in about 10 minutes without many questions on their part, and very little rules referencing as we went along with our game. ... Overall the game is highly entertaining, intelligent, and has a bit of a different spin that other deck building games I\u2019ve played. It\u2019s a game that I can see having a lasting place in my collection, and one that I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll keep enjoying with my children time and time again.\" \u2014 Robert, Purple Pawn\nHunter, Weaponsgrade Tabletop:\n\"The art reminds me a lot of a Dr. Seuss type thing. ... It's an interesting little game, I've got to say; I've done a lot of deck-building game reviews recently... and this one's got probably the most unique mechanism I've seen. ... I do like the mechanics in it. The art is hilarious... we had some laugh-out-loud moments in this game\u2014even in funny games it doesn't always happen that often, in this one it really does. I think that says a lot about it. I really did enjoy it\u2014I liked it enough to pack it and bring it with us on this trip.\" \u2013 Hunter\n\"The game scales very well with different player counts. The major adjustment is made to the number of Era cards used in the game. This allows the game to be played as little as fifteen minutes to over an hour but still get the same experience. Very few games have this much flexibility.\" \u2013 Tyler, Board Game Quest\nJeff & Megan, All Us Geeks:\n\"Overall, I think it's a good introduction to deck-building games for those of us who are more casual or younger in age. ... I have to say the artwork, I loved; it reminded me of Jim Henson's creations. ... My favorite part of the game was building monsters.\" \u2013 Megan \n\"I do like the twist on deck-building in this. I thought that was kind of interesting. The first couple times seeing it in action was like, 'Ooh, okay...' ... I liked this a lot... I thought it was a good, solid game.\" \u2013 Jeff \n\"This is a completely unique game.\" \u2013 Andrew, Cards and Chit (FB link)\n\"I think the concept is really, really fun; the monster-building is a really good idea. ... I would introduce this to my kids. ... I could bring this into a Kindergarten or first grade classroom.\" \u2013 Adrian, Cards and Chit (review link)\n\"Changing the typical deck building mechanic of hand picking every card for your deck (think Dominion) to a highly random approach fits well with the theme.\" - Gregg, Cardboard Carnage\nForrest Bower, Bower's Game Corner:\n\"Among the six of us, none of us could think of any other game that we'd played that was similar to [Teratozoic]. ...we've probably played over a thousand different games between the six of us, so saying that this game felt unique from all 1,000 of those is a huge thumbs up!\" ... \"Overall, I really enjoyed Teratozoic. I think you will too if you're looking for a great family-weight game... because it's got great art work, it's super easy to learn and to teach. Even though the rule booklet makes it sound like it's going to be complex, it's actually super-simple to teach.\" \u2013 Bower\n\"Teratozoic is full of quirky art, funny monsters, and creative mechanics. This game is easily transportable, learnable, and an enjoyable time filler. The game plays well across age groups without difficulty. The construction quality of the game is very high... Each card\u2019s unique art gives the game replay ability, as you will be hard pressed to build the same monsters game to game.\" \u2013 Brent Brewer, backer of Teratozoic\n\"The cards themselves, are of a very high quality, and to be honest the art work displayed on the Kickstarter page does not do justice to how nice it looks in the flesh. A lot of thought has gone into this design, and it really does show. ... Overall this is a very solid game, and does have a lot of replayability, especially if the players who are playing are on the same level. There are a surprising amount of tactics involved in it, which I didn\u2019t glean from watching the tutorial videos prior to playing.\" \u2013 Oscar Russell, We The Nerdy\nBrandon & Christopher, Noobsource:\n\"It really feels like 'What if Monsters, Inc. and Spore got together and made a game.'\" \u2013 Christopher\n\"The art in the game is very simple, but effective. Clean line art and bold colors against a white background creates a great contrast allowing the monsters to pop off the card and provide the most obvious and only focus... ...the execution is nicely done. Each monster part matches up neatly with one another making it easy to visualize the fluffy, bug-eyed, tentacle monsters you create. ... You\u2019ll have to find a balance between holding onto your higher-value cards for the deck-building portion of the game while collecting specific colors and parts for the end-game clincher.\" \u2013 Biff, The League of Nonsensical Gamers\n\"The use of Eras is interesting, allowing players to slowly fine-tune their decks into having increasingly potent and valuable monsters. ... The nature of Teratozoic is quite simple, and the rules are accessible for children and adults alike. ... The theme works particularly well, as evolution makes the best out of a post-humanity cesspool by going from a highly unpredictable random central deck to a much more structured set of cards \u2013 and the beings created from them.\" \u2013 Ryan, The Cardboard Republic\n\"Strategy in Teratozoic, then, jumps around a bit. You have to know when to hold back cards, which cards to keep for your gene pool, which cards to take from the board. Point values that help you win a round won\u2019t necessarily help you win the game. ... Plays equally well with few or many players. The designers anticipated how the rules would have to change for different scenarios. ... Bonus cards keep play interesting, so every round isn\u2019t just counting and scoring.\" \u2013 Mike Eaton, Play Unplugged\nYou should pledge because I do not plan to pursue traditional distribution (i.e.: selling at retail), and will not be ordering many extra copies to sell directly. I'm planning to order enough copies to cover backer orders and manufacturing & shipping errors, and once every backer has their reward I'll be selling any left-overs directly, but once they're gone, they're gone, and there won't be many extra to begin with. Basically: If you want a copy of Teratozoic, this Kickstarter will be the only way to ensure that you get one.\nAdditionally, if the base funding goal isn't reached, Teratozoic will at best be available via POD at DriveThruCards\u2014with no box and no rule book, you'll have to box it yourself & print your own copy of the rules, and it'll still probably be about $20 (plus S/H). Pledging helps the best possible version of the game get created, and it ensures you'll get a copy of that version.\nFinally, your pledge helps support the creation of future games. I've kept the base goal low because my priority is getting Teratozoic out there, even if it means not making a meaningful profit in the process\u2014but the more people who pledge, and who pledge at higher tiers, the more money I'll be able to invest in future projects. I've worked hard within a limited budget to make Teratozoic the best game I can, and with a very successful campaign I'll be able to further develop some of my more ambitious ideas\u2014like the woody little worker-placement/fighting game and the epic story-driven (Trek-like) SciFi dungeon crawler I've been working on while Teratozoic has been out with reviewers.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile I have over a decade's experience producing print-ready files for my books, I've been working with card and box printers for less than a year.

Additionally, for volumes between 50 and about 1,000 copies I plan on working with SuperiorPOD for production of the game's tuck boxes and rule books\u2014I've been happy with their output and have had some success communicating with them, but I'm aware there are horror stories floating around the web, and it's certainly possible there could be problems, delays, or even changes in the specs of the final product if things don't work out with them.\n\nAnd while I have a lifetime of experience assembling, packing and shipping hundreds to thousands of packages a day, I'm still planning on doing the majority of the work myself, and I'm just one person. I'm sure my wife and friends will offer to help, but it's possible that shipping will take longer than expected\u2014especially if there are thousands of backers, or lots of international backers.

Now, the barbaric kingdoms that lie beyond the galactic frontier are amassing their strength, choosing this pivotal moment to strike at the heart of the fading republic, establishing new empires built upon the ashes of decaying civilizations. \nBut these outer systems are not yet strong enough to engage the forces of the Core Worlds directly. The young kingdoms must first gnaw at the edges of the crumbling frontier, developing new types of units and shrewder tactics. They must build up their energy resources to launch magnificent fleets and overwhelming ground forces. Then, when the time is right, they must strike at the galactic core itself, claiming the most exalted planets for themselves. The barbarian kingdom that achieves these goals will carve out the greatest empire in the galaxy.\nEach player controls a barbarian Star Empire. Throughout the game, players will invade Worlds and draft new Units and Tactics into their Empires. Each Unit and World you acquire is worth a certain number of Empire Points. The player whose Empire contains the most Empire Points at the end of the game is the winner!\nCore Worlds Digital is a game based on the original Core Worlds deck-building card game. The following are the central concepts of Core Worlds Digital: \nCentral Zone: Throughout the game, new Units and Tactics are drawn from the five Galactic Decks in the Central Zone, the game's common play area. These draftable items include new Units and Tactics that the players can draft into their Empires, as well as Worlds that they can invade and conquer. \nMain UI\nEmpire: Each player represents an Empire that begins with a Home World and a Starting set of Units and Tactics. A player's Empire consists of all of the cards in his hand, draw pile, discard pile, and Warzone (tableau). \nWar Room\nFleet Strength: Each World possesses a Fleet Strength that represents the starships that defend it from attack. A World's Fleet Strength must be matched in order for that World to be successfully invaded. Many Units possess a Fleet Strength that a player can use to invade a World. \nFleet Cruiser\nGround Strength: Each World possesses a Ground Strength that represents the infantry and other ground forces that defend it from surface assault. A World's Ground Strength must be matched in order for it to be successfully invaded. Many Units possess a Ground Strength that a player can use to invade a World. \nGround Unit\nInvasion: In order to add new Worlds to his Empire, a player must launch Invasions. A player performs an Invasion by discarding enough units from his Warzone in combination with any tactics to match the Fleet Strength and Ground Strength of the World he is invading. \nInvasion\nWarzone: Each player's Empire includes a Warzone, an area in front of the player where her conquered Worlds are displayed. Players also deploy Units from their hands into their Warzones, and later use these Units to invade new Worlds.\nPlanet Quetzalcoatl\nCore Worlds Digital will allow for a new streamlined, interactive, and engaging cinematic experience for all users. Core Worlds Digital will include multiplayer support via Game Center, AI opponents, pass-and-play, tournament play, match play, in-game rewards and limited edition cards that will allow you to customize the look and feel of your empire. Experience the beautiful artwork of the original table top game, intuitive UI and an interactive 3D experience that brings the Core Worlds to life. Core Worlds Digital takes an \"easy set up & play\" approach that appeals to both avid and casual gamers!\nStart Screen\nDraw Phase Begins\nDraw Phase\nWhy not Kickstarter? We believe Kickstarter is the greatest social tool to providing incredible feedback and insight into what the market is looking for.

They'll then see, that the money they made in this campaign isn't gonna hold out till they are done. By then, Stronghold will see their mistake and start proceeding to pull the license. Then we'll probably never see it. Good thing it was only a couple bucks. Then stronghold will get someone who will at least respond to the backers concerns and not have to have 20 Alphas, Betas ... and then by 2020 we'll get our game.

Two years ago, on a whim, I grabbed my iPhone one afternoon and started recording gameplay runthroughs of my favorite board and card games, and uploading them to YouTube. And now I'm about to start my 3rd year of filming! WOOHOO!!!\nYou can check out my series at\nYOUTUBE.COM/RAHDO \nAs a sampler, here's a playlist of some recent runthroughs I've done \nI make these videos for fun, not for profit, as a way of sharing my enthusiasm and passion for the boardgaming hobby, and helping like-minded board game geeks choose which of the myriad games on the market are right for them.    \nBut as it happens, as of 2013, I've retired from full time employment, and as such can no longer afford to buy all the latest and greatest boardgames. This is fine, as I've got more than enough games to keep me and my wife entertained for years to come, but I would like to keep producing run-throughs of the hottest games on the market. \nThat's where you come in. \nBy backing this, my second RAHDO RUNS THROUGH Kickstarter campaign, you're funding my ability to continue to produce videos of all the latest, hottest games, ranging from the big games of the moment like Caverna and Lewis & Clark, to the soon to be released hits like The Convicted, Patchistory and Escape from Zombie City.\nJust a few of the many games that could be coming soon, with your help...\nLast year I raised $4000 in my first Kickstarter Campaign HERE, and that covered all the games purchased for the year, plus a trip to Essen Germany to cover Spiel, the biggest game convention in the world!  This year, I'm looking to achieve the same results with a couple of new stretch goals on top of that!\nHere's how it will work:\nAll the money raised will go towards the purchase of new games for filming the 2014 season of RRT, as well as a trip to the Essen Spiel convention in October, any campaign stretch goals, and any other incidentals that come up from the filming of Rahdo Runs Through.\nAll excess funds at the end of the filming year will go to Richard and Jenefer Ham as a filming salary.\nAll the expenditures of this fund will be exactingly and publicly detailed for all to see, ensuring total transparency, on my Guild at Boardgamegeek.\nIn return for your donation, you have access to a variety of rewards, most of them revolving around the idea of helping to shape the direction of the Rahdo Runs Through series.  To me, as a backer, it only makes sense that you should have a say in what direction the video series will take!\nThe Rewards\nHere's a list of the various rewards and how they work, spread amongst the different backing levels.  If there's one thing you'll soon find out about me, it's that I'm very engaged with my viewers, answering every question posted, ever! --famous last words :)\nMicrobadges - every level backer will get a microbadge to apply to their Boardgamegeek account. Of course, if you don't have a Boardgamegeek account, this won't do much for you, but it's still on offer! :)\nVoting for Videos - Every month, 3 games (sometimes more) covered by Rahdo Runs Through will be voted on by Kickstarter backers, from my ever-growing  collection of games.  The higher voting level you you pledge at, the more votes you can cast (yes, you can buy votes, I'm totally corrupt!)  This voting system will be in place until the fund runs out, which (fingers crossed) should be at least one year. \nIn addition, at certain backing levels, you will be able to specify a game (or games) to be filmed, regardless of the popular vote, so if you really want to see a game covered, this is your chance to make it so!\nVoting for Games - at voting level #4, backers will actually be able to vote for the games that are bought with the fund.  You're putting in money after all, so why not have a voice in how it's spent?  Votes can be cast for any game on this request list.  Roughly 1 out of every 5 games bought with the fund will be chosen by Kickstarter backers in this way, and like voting for videos above, voting for games take place until the fund runs out.\nIn addition, at certain backing levels, you will be able to specify a game to be bought, ignoring the request list.  This is your chance to see any game covered, provided it's not too expensive to receive in Malta (shipping included).\nCo-Hosting - if you'd like to appear in a Rahdo Runs Through video as a co-host, now's your chance!  We'll record a split screen discussion/debate/argument/love-fest between you and me as part of my 'final thoughts' on a game of your choosing, using Google Hangouts, and it will be posted on Youtube.  Instant stardom!\nPrototype Testing - if you've got a game that you're developing and you'd like some feedback about how it plays with 2 players, you can now get a direct Skype call with me after a 3-5 hour play session of your game. You'll have to arrange delivery of the prototype, or alternately we can maybe arrange a play session at Essen or Gencon (if the stretch goal is hit).\nGames - Artipia Games has very generously offered to ship a promotional copy of ANY game from their catalog, free of charge, to anywhere in the world, for three Rahdo Runs Through backers. \nSome great stuff in that catalog!\nAlso included will be a limited edition signed Rahdo Runs Through sticker commemorating the 2014 Kickstarter campaign that made Year 3 possible!\nCustom Glass Art - my wife is a talented professional glass artist, and has offered to create a beautiful and completely unique reward especially for some higher backer levels. It could be a pair of earrings, a pendant, or even a game piece as can be seen at http://www.gamerglass.eu!  She'll work in your preferred colors, and we'll ship it to you free of charge, anywhere in the world!\nHave your own piece of jewellery custom-designed just for you...\nOr if you prefer, your own custom game marker - you pick the shape, you pick the colour, you pick the design!\n\"Lucky Dip\" Game Marker - if a custom piece is out of your price range, for almost half the price, you can take a chance on a randomly selected marker from Jen's current in-stock collection of singles. These are all made with the same love and care as the custom pieces, but like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get (though Jen will quiz you about your preferred colours before she sends a piece!)\nUPDATE! OMG, you guys have totally blown through Jen's entire stock... she had no idea that could happen! I've added a second pledge level, called \"Later Lucky Dip\", which is exactly the same EXCEPT they'll be shipped out by September instead of May, giving Jen time to refresh her supplies!\nJust a small selection of the markers Jen has up her sleeve!\nGlass Set - for the true glass aficionados, you can get a full matching set of 4 player markers, again in your own custom choice of colours, or a matching necklace and earring set!\nSave the world in style...\nGet dressed up for a night on the town!\nMEGA GLASS - if you're really looking for an amazing glass opportunity, you can get a full necklace, or 2 bracelets, or a set of 20(!!) player markers, perfect for all your worker placement needs! All made to your custom specifications.\nJen's signature pieces can be yours...\nOr you can really pimp out your copy of Agricola!\nStretch Goals\nIn last year's campaign, the only real stretch goal I had was getting a decent camera for my filming, and I'm so glad we got that, as it's made such a huge difference.\nThis year, I opened a dialog with my fan-base in this thread, and it seems folks are excited to have me chase after a few new stretch goals!\nStretch Goal Number 1: Laptop Upgrade ($6000)\nThe ol' trusty netbook just isn't cutting it...\nSo while 95% of my videos are first person perspective views of boardgames being played, occasionally I film videos using the webcam and some PC capture software on my laptop. These are usually so I can talk about convention previews, or some other sort of online-feature that I need to demonstrate while running a PC.\nHowever, my plucky but underpowered Samsung NC10 netbook really isn't quite up to the job, as you can see in this video series I did teaching how to get involved in boardgame maths trades:\nSo that quality level is, how shall we say, less than stellar?  Several people have suggested that I get a new laptop that has enough horse power to do a decent job at running while recording, and I think it's a really good idea. I've love to do more videos about boardgame related stuff like previews of upcoming conventions, a proper runthrough of Boardgamegeek.com, a tutorial covering how I make and publish videos, even a semi-regular boardgame news update series!\nSo this laptop upgrade should make that sort of content more much achievable, with a decent quality level to boot! Hence, stretch goal #1 was born!  If we hit $6000, I'll be picking up a machine capable of doing decent recordings out of the box, which should widen the range of the videos I do. \nBut wait, there's more...\nStretch Goal Number 2: GENCON ($8000)\nThe best 4 days, huh? We'll see about that!\nIn addition to several game previews, at Essen Spiel 2013, I also filmed a series of videos that ran through the show itself. While I plan to do exactly the same thing this year, it turns out there's a lot of people who'd like to see me give the same treatment to the OTHER big yearly boardgame Mecca event: Gencon, held in Indianapolis, Indiana in August. So, if we hit $8000, I'll be booking flights, getting tickets, and preparing to bring you as much cool and exclusive coverage as I can muster from the show. To get an idea of what we're talking about, here's a playlist of some of the videos I filmed while at at Essen. \nI learned a lot doing those, and I can only imagine I'll produce even better stuff this year at Gencon, if we hit this goal!\nStretch Goal #3 - JEN!!! ($9000)\nA lot of my viewers LOVE it when my wife Jen makes occasional guest appearances in my videos.  They are few and far between, but here's a playlist of the ones where she's shown up:\nNow my wife is actually very camera shy, so she's a bit reticent to join in usually. Plus these runthroughs can take a surprisingly long time to film, and since she works from home, this takes away from her time making glass art and making a living! \nBUT, the requests for her to show up more often have been so overwhelming, Jen has agreed to appear in 12 runthroughs over the next 12 months if we can hit our 3rd stretch goal of $9000.  She's quite nervous about the whole thing, but willing to give it a go because there have been so many requests!\nStretch Goal #4 - HELP! ($11,500)\nBoy I REALLY hope we hit this. I really enjoy making runthrough videos, but the one part of it I don't enjoy at all is the maintenance of the videos. You may have noticed I make the occasional error while filming (GASP!) Yes, it's true! And I generally try to ensure that all errors are annotated in the videos so people get a full and true representation of the gameplay.\nBut doing these annotations, while relatively easy, is also time consuming, and since I tend to be a lazy sod, I put it off for various periods of time until I'm so far behind I have to spend several hours at a stretch updating everything.\nDas ist nicht so gut!\nSo I've spoken with one of my most regular viewers who personally spots more errors by himself in my vids than every other viewer combined. And he's agreed to join the Rahdo team by taking over annotation duties as a part time gig for what is a very reasonable price, for 1 year's worth of monitoring & updating. And that's where this stretch goal, at $11,500 comes in. If we can hit it, you'll hopefully all enjoy a more error-free Rahdo Runs Through experience! (yes yes, the errors will still be there, but at least they'll be promptly noted!) \nStretch Goal #5 - GAME CHANGER ($12,500)\nOMG, someone just pointed out to me the existence of the Pivothead wearable camera system, which looks absolutely amazing!\nChanging the game - oh yeah!\nI've always dismissed GoPro cameras which many people have suggested because I wouldn't be able to see what I'm filming, and Google Glass is insanely expensive, so that was out.  But these seem perfect for me, and here's how they'd change the game:\nIf they work (that's a big if, but they seem very promising!) I'd start filming runthroughs with two cameras: my Panasonic TM90 (from last year's Kickstarter campaign), and the Pivotheads. The Panny would be set up as a static longshot with the whole game in frame, never moving, and the eye glasses as I film now.\nI would then post BOTH videos to YouTube. So for people who have a hard time with the camera motion, you can watch the long shot Panny video, and for people who can handle motion, you can get up close and personal with the Pivothead video.\nThis seems PERFECT for my style of gonzo filming, and finally motion sensitive folks will have an option to watch my stuff without discomfort! AND I'll finally have 2 hands free to film with! AMAZING, a real game changer!\nSo there we go, and we only have to hit $12,500 to do it!  I am super excited for this!\nStretch Goal #6 - SPEED BOOST ($14,000)\nPart of that whole \"retired living\" thing I've got going on is that we scrimp on basic services, including our internet. We go with the cheapest option our ISP provides, and it's fine for regular web surfing and whatnot.\nBUT, this year, I've got a lot more co-hosting sessions I'll be doing, and if you saw the ones I did last year, you can tell that my bandwidth was a real drag. Just check out this online interview I did with Joel \"Drive Thru Review\" Eddy:\nIt's passable, but it just gets worse and worse as the video progresses. Skip to the last 10 minutes, and you'll see I'm a blurry splotch running at probably 7 or 8 FPS. :)\nSo, it's been suggested that for the next year, we upgrade our broadband service a bit so that these co-host session will look good. This also means I'll be able to upload my HD videos faster as well (currently it takes anywhere from 5 to 10 hours to uploaded a full runthrough).\nI've just gotten off the phone with my ISP, and 12 months of an upgrade will put the next stretch goal at $14,000 (after Kickstarter fees and US->EU fees). We're definitely getting into stretch territory here, I think, but let's see if we can do it!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI'm not really anticipating any particular challenges or risks - other than maybe laryngitis! Last year I was able to hit all of the backer's requests while still producing over 150 videos, and while I might be slowing down a tiny bit this year, I still fully expect to put out a high volume of videos for all to enjoy.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #16", "update_userinfo": "YEAR 4 is a go!", "update_content": "Hey there, just wanted to drop a quick line, since you backed me on  my Year 3 campaign, you might want to know that my Year 4 fundraiser is up and running.

When times are good, the bold birds snatch up the best nest sites and food resources. When times are hard, however, the shy birds work together to help raise chicks. It takes all kinds!\nTurning Sunshine into Supper - Scientist: Angela Douglas / Artist: TBA! - This story explains how creatures big and small can work together for mutual benefit, focusing on the partnership between sea animals and the single-celled microbes that photosynthesize sunlight into sugars for them to eat. In return, the animal provides a safe place for the microbe to live.\nStories have the power to delight and to teach. We believe in Great Adaptations as an effective, and most importantly, fun way to get kids asking questions about the world they live in.

Desperate to procrastinate on writing the commentary for the book, she starts playing around with it and discovers that the mosquito's last meal was one of dinosaur blood.\n\nA few months and a LOT of NSF funding later, she's successfully cloned a dinosaur. This sets the wheels turning for a research facility to house cloned dinosaurs. The Great Adaptations team is completely thrilled for her, but we are also a bit vexed about how late that chapter is. I mean, we're sure the park is going to run without a hitch, but we're also positive that she'll have no time to help us finish the chapter. In the end, we're forced to turn to one of her colleagues to fill in the gaps on her research and the book is a few months late.\n\nBut hey, at least there's a park full of cloned dinosaurs! And maybe we could arrange for the highest backers to go on a little field trip, eh??\n\n(Seriously, though: six of the stories are already written, and the rest are underway.

Scroll down to see our next stretch goal!\nWe love Morph here at Aardman. He\u2019s one of the first characters we created when we started out in the crazy world of animation.  He was originally in a programme called Take Hart, where he lived on the desk of the artist and presenter, Tony Hart. He was a simple clay character who would mess up Tony\u2019s desk and get into all kinds of mischief while Tony wasn't looking. Due to his metamorphosing capabilities, we decided to call him Morph!  Here are some of his classic moments from the show:\nPLAY\n\nI\u2019m amazed and humbled that even though it has been over 30 years since his birth, the little guy still has such a passionate following on Facebook and YouTube. We\u2019ve had so many people asking for him to make a comeback that I thought it\u2019s about time we start hatching a plan.\nThe world has changed a lot since Dave (Morph\u2019s co-creator) and I were first sat in a tiny studio, away from civilisation, making little films about a clay character that messed up Tony Hart\u2019s desk and simply hoping that an audience would like them. Something wondrous came along called \u2018the Internet\u2019 which broke down the divide between programme creators and their audience so that nowadays we don\u2019t have to second-guess what our audience want, we can just ask them! \nOne from the album: Dave and I working on Morph's original adventures!\nI love the idea that Kickstarter can give us the creative freedom to fundraise and work directly with our audience.  After checking with Morph\u2019s Facebook fans it seems that they\u2019d be interested too, which is a great start!  So now\u2019s our chance, yours and mine together, to see how this can work out and how we can make some great new Morph films.\nRight, let's get on to the fun bit! If you help us reach our Kickstarter target, here\u2019s what we plan to do with the money:\nWhat? Morph\u2019s adventures have always worked best as short films, and so we plan to make 12 new one-minute episodes, which we will release online for everyone to enjoy.\nEarly sketches: the 'magic hole' gag\nHow? Staying true to the original format, we plan to shoot the episodes using clay and traditional stop-frame animation, in Morph\u2019s original home at Aardman studios in Bristol. I will be dusting off the director\u2019s chair and there\u2019s an eager team of expert animators ready for the challenge.\nMaking Morph: each Morph puppet is sculpted by hand out of clay.\nWhen? If we reach our goal, production will start in January with the aim of finishing the episodes and releasing them online by July.\nAnd what about storylines? I have plenty of ideas up my sleeve for new Morph adventures and scripting would start in January.  I\u2019m very keen on keeping the humour, slapstick and surrealism of the originals, whilst at the same time bringing Morph slightly more in line with the modern world....\nYou're invited! The exciting part for us, something we\u2019ve wanted to try for a while, is that we can ask you to be involved in the production as we go along. We want you to have a window on to the production floor so you can see the episodes taking shape, ask us questions, submit ideas, be part of the Morph crew! If we get our funding, production will start in the new year, so get your thinking caps on!\nAfter asking Morph\u2019s Facebook fans what they\u2019d like to see, hopefully we\u2019ve come up with a juicy package of rewards that will tantalise the taste buds of Morph fans old and new.\nWe want to work with you to make the episodes you want to watch, so all levels of backers will have access to a private production blog.  From here you\u2019ll be able to follow the production from its beginnings in script, to storyboards, animatics, animation and release, but more importantly than this, we want to invite you to comment, vote and submit ideas as we go along that will shape the final episodes.\nAdditionally, if you\u2019d like to pledge more to the production, we\u2019ve got a host of exclusive goodies to offer - from crew t-shirts and special edition prints, up to studio tours and your very own Morph models.  I\u2019m extremely excited - we\u2019ve never opened up our studio in this way before and I hope you all find something suitable as a memento of your contribution to the project.\nIf there\u2019s a reward you would like that isn\u2019t listed, leave us a comment and we\u2019ll see what we can do.\nYOUR MORPHNESS\nA few of you have been asking what an earth a Morphness is! Well, we will make a version of you (or your favourite celeb) into a Morph figurine, including hairstyles, accessories \u2013 the works!\nTo give you a better idea of the process, here\u2019s a video of our chief model maker Enty creating a Morphness. There was no question when it came to picking a famous personality to recreate - it had to be legendary artist, presenter and our dear friend, the late great Tony Hart.\nNEW REWARD!\nIt\u2019s safe to say that my brain has been swimming with Morph ideas lately, and it\u2019s all been spilling out into my sketch pad. I\u2019ve decided to offer some of these up as rewards on our page, including the one below, in return for your generous pledges.\nRight then you lovely lot! Thanks to YOU we\u2019ve fully funded our campaign to make 15 new adventures of Morph. Huzzah!\nThere's still time left on the campaign and we have plenty of juicy rewards left. If Morph\u2019s fans would like to keep pledging, we\u2019d LOVE to make some more Morph adventures! After batting my eyelids and telling our accountant that he looked very pretty, he\u2019s allowed us to add a contribution towards the production costs of the extra episodes - but we\u2019d need the following amount from you to make it happen:\n...and you will of course get a copy of any additional episodes created as part of your digital download or DVD reward.\nSo I think that covers everything for now. Thank you again for all your support and I hope you like the new part of our plan! You thought you were getting 12 episodes, but thanks to your amazing efforts, it looks as if there'll be more! Result.\nPete, Morph and all the team at Aardman", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe production of the episodes and fulfilment of rewards will all be covered by the team at Aardman, so you\u2019re in safe hands. The only possible, but small, risks we can foresee are any unexpected delays to the production schedule.\n\nIt\u2019s not something we take lightly - the producers here at Aardman can plan a production with military precision (you should see their spreadsheets \u2013 oh my!) but sometimes things happen that are out of our control \u2013 staff sickness, random acts of God, fire, precious models being left on the back seats of taxis - you know the story. There are some rewards that are dependent on us completing the production \u2013 digital downloads, DVDs, screenings of the episodes, and so this would have a knock on effect.\n\nThe same goes for our rewards \u2013 we\u2019ve planned out the fulfilment of each one and will make every effort to stick to the delivery schedule stated, but stock or shipping issues from our supplier may cause unplanned delays.\n\nBut fear not, we\u2019ll be in regular contact with you all via the production blog, so you\u2019ll be able to check up on the production on a weekly basis and will be the first to know of any changes.\n\nTHE FINE PRINT (a few things our legal eagles asked me to say) \n\n\u2022 You must be over 18 or accompanied by a parent or legal guardian (who will count as your plus one) to attend the Morph screening evening, take part in the model making Google Hangout or visit the set.\n\n\u2022 Travel and accommodation are not included with any of the reward packages\n\n\u2022 If we choose one of your ideas to include in the production, we will need to get you to sign some paperwork to say that you have let us use your idea for now and into the future. In exchange, we will give you a credit in the relevant episode. Just be aware that it may be such a great idea that either we\u2019ve already thought of it, or maybe other people have already suggested it!\n\n\u2022 This fundraising campaign is all subject to applicable Kickstarter rules/regulations and applicable law.

You'll learn more about both of them in future posts. \nWe're really stoked about launching this Kickstarter. We had such a great time putting RARRR!! together, and an even better time playing it. While it's a simple thing, we find it's an amazing amount of fun building the monsters. \nHelp MO move up the building! See the Stretch Goals section below for more details about each level.\nUpdate: Two new stretch goals added for backer-selected monsters. Backers will submit monster ideas for the group to vote on. The winner gets included with all KS copies of the game!\nWe'll update MO daily! \nWord is getting around about RARRR!! See what people are saying.\nFather Geek \nRARRR!! won the Father Geek seal of approval! This means that Gamer Geeks, Parent Geeks AND Child Geeks all gave the game a thumbs up!\n\"..the game is highly replayable, but it\u2019s the same type of game play throughout. No special powers, no special victory conditions, and no surprises. Ever. The game will not shock you with a turn of a card and force you to completely reevaluate how you play the game. A player\u2019s opponents will, however. Especially when a specific City card suddenly becomes highly contested over. Second, building the Monster with just the right Katakana cards is crucial. Players should either seek balance with all the power types or focus on no more than two. This will guide them with drafting Power cards which will lead to stronger card plays during battles. Failure to do so will cause the player to be terribly ineffective with victories being more based on luck rather than smart card plays.\" \nSee the full RARRR!! preview on the Father Geek website. \nCrits Happen\nTox at Crits Happen did a great critical preview video for RARRR!!\n\"RARRR!! is a very fun, very interesting style smash city type game.\"\n\"For a monster game, RARRR is surprisingly light, both in terms of complexity to pick up, and in actual portability! While simple to pick up, the options and strategy are there, and thus far RARRR has proved to be a big punch in a small package!\"\n\"We have really enjoyed our time with RARRR!!\"\nSee the full video prevew on the Crits Happen website.\nDice Tower\n Ryan Metzler at The Dice Tower previewed RARRR!! \n\"A pretty cool little game - one that has a lot going for it in various different aspects.\"\nSee Ryan's full preview video here.\nSFSignal \nNick Sharps from Hugo-winning sci-fi blog SFSignal did an interview with APE's Kevin Brusky about RARRR!! Questions focused on the development process more so than gameplay. \nSee the interview on the SFSignal site. \nRARRR!! comes with 8 different monsters - each with it's own katakana (syllable) and powers.\nAt the beginning of the game, each player gets one of the monsters, then drafts katakana cards to completely form the monster's name and powers. The monster and katakana cards are combined in any order to create a number of awesome names! RARRR!! contains 24 different katakana cards. \nAfter building your monster, draft a hand of power cards. Power cards fuel your monster as it battles others for the privilege of rampaging through cities. There are four different types of power - electrical, fire, radioactive and toxic. They range in value from 1 to 3.There are 72 Power cards in the game. \nPlayers spend their power to battle other monsters. \nCities are the game's victory points. In the advanced game, collect cities of the same color for bonus points, but beware - each city has a resistance to a certain power type! There are 24 different cities - 4 each on 6 different continents (more or less). \nPlayers spend their power to battle other monsters. Each player gets a Battle Dial to track their monster's power level (not final art).\nEach player gets one set of wild cards that can be used to add to any power once per game.\nClick the video below to learn how to play the base game. \nRARRR Full Rules and Print and Play \nFor more information, find the full rules on apegames.com/rarrr. \nYou can also find a print and play demo version of RARRR!! on the APE Games website.  \nWe have had feedback that the game's math is harder than the standard 8-year old can manage. We have heard that, and are working on basic game rules, which will make it into the full rulebook. \nStretch goals are the grease that make the Kickstarter wheels turn, and we've got 'em!\nIn addition to the normal post-funding stretch goals that Kickstarter backers are used to, we'll be offering FREE pre-funding progress rewards to pledgers that back at the one RARRR!! copy or higher (including the EARLY BIRD levels)!\nNote that none of the stretch goal monsters will appear in the retail version of the game. APE will sell them at conventions, etc. but they won't be available in the copy you buy in stores.\n$4,000 Progress Goal - MO Papercraft\nMO the gorilla is the first of two progress goal papercraft monsters that we'll be giving away for free to all backers. MO sports a jet in one hand and like all of Bob's monster art, killer eyebrows.\n$7,000 Progress Goal - GO Papercraft\nThe second pre-funding progress goal monster is GO, the giant reptile! GO carries a train and spiky bits all around. Don't let that bored expression fool you - GO's radioactive powers can level cities with the vicious of monsters!\n$10,000 Progress Goal - Buildings Papercraft\nOf course monsters need a city to rampage, and the $16K pre-funding progress goal offers you just that! All backers get the building papercrafts for free!\n\n$14,000 Stretch Goal - Bonus Monster - TO\nTO is far from your average sewer rat. Like rats of the Middle Ages, TO spreads the plague, with a hefty dose of radiation poisoning. Will not be available in the retail version. One free to all backers per copy of RARRR!! pledged.\n$16,000 Stretch Goal - Bonus Monster - BO\nBO takes man-eating plants to a whole new level as it chomps entire buildings with a single bite. Will not be available in the retail version. One free to all backers per copy of RARRR!! pledged.\n$18,000 Stretch Goal - Bonus Monster - RU\nRU adds a second giant robot into the fray. Now you can do robot vs. robot! Will not be available in the retail version. One free to all backers per copy of RARRR!! pledged.\n$20,000 Stretch Goal - Bonus Monster - WA\nWA will swoop in and set the city aflame! Will not be available in the retail version. One free to all backers per copy of RARRR!! pledged.\n$22K Stretch Goal - Backer-Selected Monster\nThe CUSTOM CARD add-on already has two backer-selected monsters. If we hit this stretch goal, then you'll get a chance to vote on a monster that ALL backers will get!\nIf we hit $22K, then we'll put up a poll on polljunkie.com for backers to select a monster of your choice!\n$24K Stretch Goal - Backer-Selected Monster\nLet's do it again!\nThe CUSTOM CARD add-on already has two backer-selected monsters. If we hit this stretch goal, then you'll get a chance to vote on a monster that ALL backers will get!\nIf we hit $24K, then we'll put up a poll on polljunkie.com for backers to select a monster of your choice!\nYou've pledged for RARRR!!, now you can add in some more stuff! Bob Canada is making his remarkable talents outside of the custom city and custom monster pledge levels. Also, in case you missed our previous three Kickstarter projects, you can add them as part of this Kickstarter! \nNote that we're only doing add-ons for pledges that also include at least one copy of RARRR!! After all, this is a RARRR!! Kickstarter project!\nIn order to include add-ons in your pledge, just follow these simple steps:\nPledge for at least 1 copy of the RARRR!! base game\nFigure out the add-ons you'd like from this section, and add the additional cost into your pledge. We created the convenient table below to help you figure out the total amount of your pledge\nWrite down which add-ons you paid for. We'll ask you later for those add-ons (see next step below)\nAfter the project ends, we'll send out a survey. You can tell us there which of the add-ons you paid for.\nAdd-On Calculator Table\nDownload printable version\n$7 - Custom Monster and City Cards\nGet the whole set of custom monster and custom city cards - the more people that pledge at the RARRR!! CUSTOM CITY BACKER level ($125)or the CUSTOM MONSTER LEVEL ($250), the more cards you get! Note that none of the CUSTOM cards (monsters or cities) will be available in the retail version of the game. \nRevised: We've retooled this add-on to make it significantly more attractive. In addition to the above, backers will get:\nAt least 4 monsters. This is in addition to the monsters created in the $250 level. This includes any monsters that wouldn't be included because we do not meet the stretch goal. So if the project closes at $17K, then this level will include the $18K and $20K stretch goal monsters. We'll always have at least two stretch goal monsters above where the current funding amount is, so there will always be two additional monsters to be included in this set.\nTwo additional backer-selected cities. This is in addition to the cities selected as part of the $125 level. Each week we'll poll backers for which new city they'd like to see included in this custom add-on. That's right, you the backers will pick two new cities. This of course isn't as cool as backing at the $125 to select the city yourself and customizing your own city skyline!\n$35 - RARRR!! Monster Doodle\nRARRR!! artist Bob Canada will create a custom monster sketch, similar to the sketches in this project's section headers. The sketch will be done on thick cardstock that includes the RARRR!! logo.\n$60 - RARRR!! Deluxe Monster Doodle\nBob Canada will create a custom sketch of a monster in an enviornment, knocking down buildings, etc. The sketch will be done on thick cardstock that includes the RARRR!! logo.\n$20 - Kill the Overlord \nGet our hot-potato passing party card game for 4-8 execrable scoundrels, ages 10+. Add Kill the Overlord to your order and get a free Gravedigger promo character card! \nWe're also making available the Kill the Overlord exclusive character promo pack. Add $4 to get all four promo characters. Note that if you also get Kill the Overlord base game plus the promo character pack, only one Gravedigger will be included. \nAdd $8 to your RARRR!! pledge to get the Kill the Overlord third character set. This is a set of eight more characters and three new 'badge' cards. \n$30 - Island Siege \nIsland Siege is a two-player game for ages 13+. Players are governors in 17th-century West Indies. Build forts, buildings and ships, then lay siege to your opponent's colony! Island Siege comes with a set of 13 metal coins created by Campaign Coins. \nAdd $7 to your RARRR!! pledge for the Coquina expansion - 6 more cards and 5 pink 'coquina' cubes. \nAdd $8 to your RARRR!! for the Rampart expansion - 24 additional cards.\nAdd the Island Siege coins to your RARRR!! pledge for $12. Get 13 coins (eight x 1, three x 5, two x 10).\n$70 - Rolling Freight\nGet the game that reviewer Tom Vasel from The Dice Tower put in his top 100 games list, and Ryan Metzler called one of the top 10 games of 2012! Add Rolling Freight to your order for an additional $70. This price includes the exclusive 2-player Texas map - back for the first time since the Kickstarter back in 2011! Note that for shipping purposes, Rolling Freight counts as 4 games for purposes of international shipping. \nAdd just the Texas map to your RARRR!! pledge for an additional $15.\nAdd the India/Great Britain expansion to your RARRR!! pledge for an additional $20.\n$55 - Order of the Stick\nAPE Games was also involved in the Order of the Stick Kickstarter project that was so successful in 2012. We're offering the Order of the Stick Deluxe game for $55 with free exclusive Sticky Shticks. The Order of the Stick game counts as 4 games for purposes of international shipping.\nIf you already have the base game, then add just the Sticky Shticks to your RARRR!! pledge for just $6. \nWhew! Thanks to everyone that's helped back our Kickstarter projects in the past! \nInternationally, your order may ship in multiple boxes, to save you shipping costs. If we can ship your order via First Class mail, you'll save huge money, but it needs to weigh less than 4 pounds.\nPlease add the indicated amount to your pledge. Note that a 'game' counts as RARRR!!, Kill the Overlord or Island Siege (including any promos added on). Rolling Freight counts as 4 games.\nCanadian and International backers can use the convenient pledge table mentioned in the Add-On section above to determine the total cost of shipping.\nShipping in the U.S.\nShipping is free in the United States, regardless what rewards you pledge.\nShipping to Canada\n1-2 games or each set of 1-2 games: $7. As an example, 1 game costs $7 shipping, 4 games cost $14 and 5 games cost $21.\nShipping Internationally\n1-2 games $26, 3-4 /games, $52. 5+ games $74. \nRetailer Shipping\nRetailers pay actual shipping costs to their location. Costs and shipping methods will be negotiated with each retailer separately after the project completes, but before product ships. You don't need to add shipping to your pledge.\nFright Fight\nA friend of mine has created a  great-looking mobile game called Fright Fight (iOS and Android). That art is awesome, am I right?!

Fans got a taste of the incredible new look and feel for the series, and we now are ready to begin funding the full Season 2 shoot, with the goal of releasing the entire season early next year.\nSeason 2 is scripted and ready to go into pre-production NOW.\nOh, but we've still got some surprises in store for you guys...\nWe've landed some very exciting guest stars for Season 2, and we'll be announcing them over the coming weeks.\nVOICE OF \"RED\" - Emmy-nominated actress Mayim Bialik (Blossom, Big Bang Theory) is providing the voice of The Inspector's sentient time machine, the B.O.O.T.H.\nBERNARD - Robert Picardo (Star Trek: Voyager, Stargate: Atlantis) will be Guest-Starring at Bernard, the mysterious family physician...\nANNABELLE - Chase Masterson (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Doctor Who Big Finish) will be Guest-Starring as Annabelle Wagner!\nCLARISSA - TO BE ANNOUNCED\nRODERICK - TO BE ANNOUNCED\nMEET THE NEW DIRECTOR - NICK ACOSTA\nNick is the director of such amazing projects as Battle For Hogwarts, Riddance, Friend Request, and the 50 Shades of Grey fan-film & trailer! His visual style combined with the comedy and complexities of Season 2 are going to result in an incredible next chapter in the chronicles of The Inspector!\nGo BEHIND THE SCENES of the Season 2 Prequel!\nThe reason the Season 2 budget is so much larger than the Season 1 can be attributed to several things. First, Season 2 is going to be about 3 times longer than Season 1. Instead of 6 parts that are around 3-4 minutes apiece, we'll have 6 parts that are approximately 10-12 minutes.\nSeason 1 running time: 19 minutes\nSeason 2 expected running time: 60 MINUTES\nAlso, on Season 1 all cast and crew volunteered their time.  Besides just being the right thing to do, it would be impossible to get the level of quality that we're working towards for Season 2 without being able to offer the cast and crew some pay.  \nSo, $25K (Season 1 budget) x 3 + minimal pay for cast and crew = $125K\nThat simplifies it a bit too much. We also will have things like location fees and production insurance - things we didn't have in Season 1, but you get the idea. If it helps, each episode of Game of Thrones costs $6 million...\nHere's a breakdown of the PERKS and which levels get them. At every dollar amount, you get EVERY perk ABOVE that amount!!\n$1\nTHANK YOU!

It was built by a high-tech civilization that collapsed into barbarism, then recovered, and has gone through this cycle several times, until the remaining old technology is considered magic -- in fact, the terms \"tech\" and \"magic\" are used interchangeably -- and the city is a patchwork of ancient glories and modern improvisations. Half-drowned skyscrapers stand in the harbor, airships provide intercity transport, and the city is run by assorted guilds and factions, with no functioning central government.\nI thought this was cool, but it was decades before I finally came up with the story I wanted to set there -- Vika's Avenger.\nIt's the story of a young man named Tulzik Ambroz who comes to Ragbaan looking for the man who murdered his sister.  The only tool he has to find a single individual in a city of three million is the portrait his sister drew of the man who would later kill her.\nHe's lucky enough to find the information brokers Azl and Hrus, and to catch the interest of a creature called the Ilm, but will that be enough?\nAnd if he finds the killer, what will he do about it?\nWhy I'm Here\nI'm an award-winning author with more than forty novels to my name, but no New York publisher wanted this one.  \"It's science fantasy,\" they said.  \"We don't know how to market that.\"\nUm... John Carter of Mars is science fantasy.  Star Wars is science fantasy.  Hundreds of the classic pulp stories are science fantasy.  Apparently, though, the folks in New York have forgotten how to market the stuff if it doesn't have a major motion picture attached.  Most of the editors my agent approached wouldn't even read it.  No one ever said it wasn't a good story, only that they didn't know how to market it.\nI think it's a cool story, and I bet you will, too, marketing or not.  Aliens, airships, secret societies, genetic engineers...\nSo help me publish it, and you'll get to read it!  Not to mention some of the cool extras.\nThanks!\nA little dialogue to whet your appetite.\nStretch Goals:\nNow that we're funded, what else can we do?\nWell, here are a few ideas:\n$8,000:  The cover and interior will be professionally laid out, and there will be a frontispiece.  Made it!\nActually, I think we're looking at a total of three pieces of interior art.\n$10,000:  More interior illustrations!  Details not yet determined, but if we reach this total there will be interior art, in black and white, in addition to the three illustrations already promised.  Backers who are getting the ebook will receive them as separate PDF files; they will not be incorporated directly into the ebooks.\n$12,000:  I'll write an appendix, \"A Traveler's Guide to Ragbaan,\" which will be included in the book.  This will describe a few of the city's features; since I haven't written it yet, I don't know just what it'll say.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe novel is entirely written, but I need money for a professional editor and a decent cover -- the more money pledged here, the better the cover artist I can afford.

I've talked to a few artists, and found out what they would charge, but I'd need more than my minimum for most of them -- much more, for some -- and I haven't worked with any of them before, so commissioning the artwork will be uncharted territory for me. I've self-published before, but using existing art or reworked photos, and I've commissioned art before, but not under exactly these conditions.\n\nI've published through various print-on-demand outfits and small presses before, and l've put out ebooks through several outlets in the past, so I know what I'm doing there.\n\nPacking and shipping -- I've done that before, too, working from my house. If it looks like it might be more than I can handle, I'll look into other options.\n\nReally, the only place I see where anything might go wrong is the cover art, and even there, I'll be working with professionals, and I have multiple options. I don't foresee any problems -- but of course, by definition, the unforeseen can crop up anywhere.\n\nBecause I'll be working with artists, and things can always go wrong, I can't promise delivery by a specific date, but I think I can promise everything will indeed get delivered.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #32", "update_userinfo": "New editions", "update_content": "Hi, folks!\nI know, I said I was all finished, but...\nSeveral people, including me, thought the type in Vika's Avenger was a bit small for those of us with older eyes; I am pleased to report that a new edition with larger print (still not all that large) has been uploaded to Amazon, and should be available shortly."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #31", "update_userinfo": "Tidying Up", "update_content": "Hello, folks!\nI am pleased to report that the audiobook of Vika's Avenger is now available at http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/Vikas-Avenger-Audiobook/B00NUD8S94/ref=a_search_c4_1_3_srTtl?qid=1411709895&sr=1-3 \nAlso, the reader (Paul Licameli) caught a grand total of fifteen small mistakes in the text, mostly punctuation typos.

Here are the final stretch goals!\nPaperback is a word game where players create words. It's 2-4 players and takes about 45 minutes.  You score words in order to buy better letters with cool abilities. But scoring won\u2019t win the game \u2013 you must finish novels to make it as a paperback writer.\nPaige is determined to make it as a novelist. She\u2019ll have to work her way up writing everything from Mystery to Romance to get to the best seller list. Also, Paige loves the worlds she writes about and secretly wishes she could live them.\nPaperback blends the skill of word games like Scrabble\u2122 with the interesting choices of deck-building games like Dominion\u2122. There are many ways to win \u2013 making short powerful words, long clever words or possibly a double word score.  Each card has a distinct ability that can dramatically help your score if used wisely.  \nIn each hand there is usually one perfect word that will use all your letters \u2013 you just need to find it!   Flexibility comes from two elements: a \u2018common\u2019 vowel and wild letter cards.  The 'common' vowel can be used by all players and changes throughout the game.  You will have several wild cards in your deck - wilds also double as victory points, which determine the winner.\nCheck out the Rules here\nKickstarter is a necessity to get the capital required to print a boardgame.  It is also fantastic way to get the word out about this unique game.\nWe believe in creating innovative, educational, and positive games. This is our family business and we have a commitment to fast, accurate service.  We are available to answer any questions you have and love to hear about your experiences with the game.\nThe game comes in a sturdy Two-piece box with 200 cards, full color instructions and counters for use with optional rules.\nRich Sommer (@richsommer):\n\"Here's what I like about Paperback: it allows for planning in a way that other word games don't. It rewards a strong vocabulary, sure...but it also allows someone who's not a Scrabble aficionado just as much a chance at winning. Plus, I love deck-building. So that's a bonus.\"\nJeff Cannata (@jeffcannata) of the Totally Rad Show:\n\"I love word games and I love deck builders - now I can get both in one game! Paperback is a blast to play, and much easier to get into for my less geeky friends than many of the other fantasy-themed deck building games.\"\nEric R. Burgess of Boardgame Babylon:\n\"Paperback is a terrific game for just about anyone. Serious gamers can geek out on the clever use of deckbuilding mechanisms in a classic word game. Casual players can enjoy the easy gameplay and creativity they express in their word choices each turn. Families can delight in the well-disguised educational value and very obvious fun Paperback provides. Our family and friends have had a great time playing Paperback and I know you will, too.\"\nAn extensive review from Father Geek:\n\"I like it. I like it a lot. It\u2019s the only word game I have played in a VERY LONG TIME that had me thinking on multiple levels. I really enjoyed the deck-building aspect as it challenged me to buy cards that I knew I could use with existing Letter cards for mega points. That is actually a lot harder than it seems because every Letter card is only as good as the other Letter cards that are in your hand. I also had to be creative when it came to maximizing the card abilities. If I did it right, my simple three-letter word scored massive points, which felt great. I think this is the closest thing to a \u201cgamer\u2019s word game\u201d I have ever seen. The game play is engaging, the turns are quick, and everything I love about deck-building is seamlessly entwined with everything word gamers enjoy most, which is spelling words.\"\nMy friend, Tom Mason, enjoys the game so much that he decided Paperback needed to be on mobile devices. He is hard at work creating a digital version of the game for Apple and Android devices.  You will be able to play Paperback asynchronously against your friends anywhere!  Coming soon to App Store, Google Play and Amazon Appstore.  \nGet a copy of the Android version as an add-on to your pledge.\nWe're offering our hit games Clockwords and Now Boarding as an add-on reward.  These games have been enjoyed by millions of players. Get the Full Download version of both games as a backer.

Players take the role of 1970\u2019s, James Bond-style super villains, plotting to steal priceless artifacts from around the globe. Players battle over those artifacts in an alphabetic game of king-of-the-hill. Word buffs love the freedom to use any letter on the board, allowing players to spell ridiculously long words. But non-wordies can hold their own as well by strategically selecting which letters to use to control the board and mess with their opponents. Check out Word Domination on Kickstarter.

At the same time, Kickstarter has become widely used as a pseudo-preorder system, sometimes subtly and sometimes quite explicitly. Which it \"should\" be is a debate for other places, of course, but the reality is that a lot of people do treat support for a Kickstarter project as just a purchasing decision, as opposed to considering the overall value of each project in terms of components, production costs, and so on.

Head to NeoLucida.com for purchasing options. Or follow us on Twitter and on Facebook for updates\n-----------------------------------------\nLong before Google Glass ... there was the Camera Lucida.\nThe what?\nThe camera lucida.\nIt\u2019s a prism on a stick! For making realistic drawings!\nIt used to be everywhere.\nA portable version hasn\u2019t been manufactured in generations.\nAnd we\u2019re bringing it back.\nReally inexpensively.\nFor artists and art students everywhere.\nWe have designed the NeoLucida: the first portable camera lucida to be manufactured in nearly a century \u2014 and the lowest-cost commercial camera lucida ever designed. We want to make this remarkable device widely available to students, artists, architects, and anyone who loves to draw from life. But to be clear: our NeoLucida is not just a product, but a provocation. In manufacturing a camera lucida for the 21st century, our aim is to stimulate interest in media archaeology\u2014the tightly interconnected history of visual culture and imaging technologies.\nOur project: the NeoLucida, a camera lucida for the 21st century. Shown here is a working prototype, constructed from a combination of mass-manufactured and custom-machined parts.\nWhat is this \"NeoLucida\"?\nThe NeoLucida is a drawing aid that allows you to trace what you see. Our device is the first portable, authentic camera lucida to be manufactured in nearly a century\u2014but we like to think of it as a disruption to widespread assumptions about art-making and art history. Our design is lightweight (9oz., or 0.25kg), sturdy, compact enough to fit in a handbag, highly adjustable, totally non-electronic, and released with a liberal open-source hardware license. It's also the least-expensive camera lucida ever manufactured. If you enjoy drawing from life, or if you're interested in experiencing for yourself how the Old Masters could possibly have created such accurate, lifelike drawings\u2014then the NeoLucida is for you. \nLeft: Our NeoLucida, $40. Right: An antique Camera Lucida (c.1900), about $350 on eBay. Owing to modern innovations such as adjustable gooseneck, the NeoLucida has a considerably simpler design.\nSome background history. \nBeginning in the early 17th century, artists routinely used optical aids to help them create realistic drawings. Lenses and mirrors were the \"cutting edge technology\" of their day (and sometimes, the trade secret) for making life-like images. In 1807, Sir William Hyde Wollaston invented the Camera Lucida\u2014and brought life-drawing to a whole new level. Wollaston's device was simple: a prism on an adjustable stand. When an artist looks down through the prism, they see the world in front of them, plus their hand on the page, combined in perfect superimposition. \nIn short, a camera lucida allows you to trace what you see. And it does so in full daylight; there's no need for a dark shroud or box, as with a Camera Obscura. And that is the magic of the camera lucida: it's portable, easy to use, and\u2014with a little practice\u2014you just copy the world onto your page with a confident hand. \nBy the mid-1800s, camera lucidas were everywhere. Indeed, the device is so effective in assisting accurate life-drawing that, according to the controversial Hockney-Falco hypothesis, it's now believed that many of the most admired drawings of the 19th Century, such as the Neoclassical portraits of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, could only have been made with a camera lucida. This becomes astonishingly clear if you try one\u2014an experience we hope to share with as many people as possible, through this Kickstarter.\n(If you'd like to learn more about how the Old Masters likely used optical technologies to create their work, check out David Hockney's book Secret Knowledge, or this terrific BBC documentary (at YouTube) about his research.)\nThe NeoLucida setup: clamp your NeoLucida to a table or drawing board. Place your subject in front, with your paper on the table below the prism. Simply look down into the prism to start drawing.\nPlace your eye close to the prism, looking straight down at the prism's exposed edge, to see a perfect blend of your hand and the scene in front of you.\nOur prototype in action. Here's an unaltered photograph taken through the NeoLucida's eyepiece. The world in front of you is superimposed onto your paper. Just trace what you see!\nNow try this experiment. Go to a group of fine-art students. Find the ones who claim to adore the \"Old Masters\"\u2014and ask them if they\u2019ve ever tried, or even heard of, a camera lucida. We'll bet they haven't (or that they've confused it with the camera obscura). Perhaps it's because a different \"camera\"\u2014the photographic film camera\u2014revolutionized image-making in the intervening century. Once photography became accessible to all, previously common drawing tools like the camera lucida were almost entirely forgotten\u2014and the Old Masters who used them were increasingly believed to have possessed supernatural drawing powers. \nIt hasn't helped that portable camera lucidas have become so rare and costly that most students will never have the chance to try one\u2014not even in an art school. Authentic camera lucidas have become curiosities and fetish objects for antiquarians and professionals, typically costing $300-$500 on eBay. But it's a marvellously simple, useful device\u2014it shouldn't be so exotic!\nSo, why are you doing this? We both have a lot of students who've come to believe that being able to draw photo-realistically is the most important thing. We both love realistic drawing, but not necessarily the way it\u2019s usually taught\u2014which often ignores the tightly-intertwined relationship between drawing and imaging technologies. In particular, art students are encouraged to draw photo-realistically, in the manner of the Old Masters, but without the proper tools for doing so. So we're producing the NeoLucida as a provocation, not as a business, to help get this discussion started. We hope the NeoLucida will prompt new questions about the relationship of art and technology\u2014and potentially even disrupt business-as-usual in the classroom. Most importantly, we genuinely believe that using a camera lucida will profoundly change how people see, how they draw, and how they think about art. \nPortraits by Pablo, created with an antique camera lucida (c.1900, left), and the NeoLucida (right).\nOur Plan.\nWait: aren't there modern, competing products?\nWe wouldn't be doing this if there were any modern-day camera lucidas that met our criteria for easy portability, low cost, and authentic optical design. Unfortunately, there aren't. For example, the LUCID-Art costs $200, weighs four times as much as the NeoLucida, and can't fit in a handbag. Likewise, the LUCI costs more than twice as much as ours; it's bulky, and difficult to adjust. And because the LUCI uses a mirror instead of a prism, you have to draw everything upside-down! (With ours, you draw right-side-up.) Amazingly, these are the only camera lucidas currently being manufactured today\u2014and neither uses the elegant and compact optical design employed throughout the 19th century.\nDesign and Production.\nWe know that for a young artist to even consider experimenting with a camera lucida, it has to be inexpensive. So we\u2019ve designed the NeoLucida to consist almost entirely of prefabricated parts made in China (such as the clamp, prism, and flexible gooseneck mount), and available through business-to-business marketplaces like Alibaba. The only custom pieces (in the optics mount) have been designed by our expert friends at StandardRobot, a Pittsburgh-based mechatronics studio, and will be machined right here in the U.S.A. For both international and domestic parts, we\u2019ve already received multiple bids from different suppliers, and have factored the costs of shipping and customs into our reckoning. \nOur design is complete. We've learned a ton about the Chinese component marketplace. We\u2019ve made and tested several working prototypes, and we're ready to fufill our dream of getting inexpensive camera lucidas into the hands of lots of people. But to do this at all, we have to meet our suppliers\u2019 minimum order requirements\u2014usually, depending on the component, at least 500 pieces. If we can raise 500 orders, then our dream can be your reality! The NeoLucidas themselves will be assembled at Golan\u2019s studio in Pittsburgh, with the assistance of some careful students.\nThis is a Limited Run of Open Source Hardware.\nOur first batch of NeoLucidas will also be our only batch\u2014because, as we\u2019ve explained, we\u2019re doing this as a fun intervention, not to start a business. Once we\u2019ve finished distributing the NeoLucidas, we will publish our designs, CAD files, and all of our supplier data with a liberal Creative Commons and Open-Source Hardware (OSHW) license, so that anyone who wishes can continue the project (including, potentially, commercially). Our design and other manufacturing information will appear on NeoLucida.com, Instructables, Scribd, and other appropriate sites. We hope others will be inspired to pick up where we leave off!\nYour own NeoLucida. \nIf you support our project at the $40 level or higher, you'll get one NeoLucida in a draw-string pouch, plus instructions on using and caring for your device. The cost of shipping (within the US) is included.\nSo how is your NeoLucida \u201cprism-on-a-stick\u201d manufactured? We use a silvered prism, optimized for optical clarity, carefully encased in a custom anodized aluminum mount. The prism is supported by a highly adjustable gooseneck arm and a sturdy metal clamp. We even use a 1/4\u201d-20 threaded bolt as the connection between the gooseneck arm and the prism holder\u2014so your NeoLucida arm can easily double as a standard camera mount. All this is hand-assembled in Pittsburgh before being carefully packaged and sent off to you. Open it up and start drawing right away!\nBut there's more. Beyond just making a device for your use, we really want to see what you draw with your NeoLucida. In some ways, this is the true heart of our project. That\u2019s why every recipient of a NeoLucida will also receive a postage-prepaid blank postcard. And a NeoLucida pencil, too. Make a drawing with your NeoLucida, pop the card in the mail, and your drawing may end up in a published collection of NeoLucida drawings!\nCan I get more than one? Unfortunately not, per Kickstarter's \"Single Serving rule\" for rewards in the Product Design category. If, however, you're interested in classroom packs or other wholesale arrangements, please contact us privately. \nBacked by Primary Research.  \nSo, how are we qualified to do this, and why are we confident? We're both art professors and have spent the bulk of our careers using both modern and historical imaging technologies. Sure, most artists have used digital cameras\u2014but we've logged tons of hours with concave mirrors, large biconvex lenses, camera obscuras and camera lucidas.\nSelections from Pablo Garcia's personal collection of vintage camera lucidas.\nPablo using one of his antique camera lucidas, Iceland, 2010.\nExamples of Pablo's camera lucida drawings, 2010.\nPablo has spent a dozen years drawing with his camera lucida. Since acquiring his first one in 2001, he has also amassed one of the world's largest collections of primary and secondary research into the technology and history of this device. Pablo's collection includes many of the most important books, patents, articles, schematics, and contemporary accounts of the camera lucida. \nPossibly the best evidence that we're qualified to conduct this project is Pablo\u2019s personal collection of antique camera lucidas. Over the course of a decade, he has acquired the best examples of original camera lucidas throughout history. In his collection are devices from 1820, 1840, 1860, 1880, 1900, 1930, and several versions sold as children's drawing aids from the 1940s through the 1960s. This collection is one of the most complete primary resources on the technology around\u2014and served as the research foundation for our design of the NeoLucida.\nWho are we?\nPablo Garcia and Golan Levin are university art professors and new-media artists, with a strong shared interest in the history and poetics of imaging technologies.\nPablo Garcia (@prgarc) is Assistant Professor of Contemporary Practices at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Trained as an architect, Pablo's recent work has evolved from design-for-hire to internationally exhibited artworks, provocations and research studies. His work has appeared on FastCompany/Co.Design, io9, ArtInfo, ThisIsColossal, Gizmodo, Make, The Creators Project and many others. Previously, Pablo has taught at Carnegie Mellon, Parsons, University of Michigan, and Princeton. From 2004-2007, he also worked as an architect and designer for Diller Scofidio + Renfro.\nGolan Levin (@golan) is Associate Professor of Computation Arts at Carnegie Mellon University; a member of the Free Art and Technology artist collective; and an enthusiastic Kickstarter supporter. At CMU, he also directs the Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry, a laboratory for anti-disciplinary research across the arts, sciences, technology, and culture. A two-time TED speaker, Golan has been called one of \"50 Designers Shaping the Future\" by Fast Company Magazine, an \"A-OK guy\" by Bruce Sterling, and a lot of other things. \nWe're also greatly indebted to our tireless research assistant Sarah Keeling, who has spent long nights communicating with Chinese vendors; to our expert mechanical engineer, Greg Baltus, of StandardRobot; to Benji Welmond, a talented filmmaker who has assisted with our videography, and to the staff of the Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry, who have supported our research in numerous other ways. \nOpen Source.\nThe NeoLucida will be wholly Open Source Hardware (OSHW), and will be released with documentation (including all CAD files) according to the definitions, standards and recommendations of the Open Source Hardware Association.\nQuestions?\nAsk away! We encourage you to post your questions on Kickstarter, so that others may benefit from your question and our response. However, you may also email us privately at info@neolucida.com, or message us on Twitter at @golan and @prgarc.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProducing a couple thousand identical products is a challenge for anyone, especially those without a factory at their disposal. We are not only leveraging the Chinese factory system, with its standard parts ready for shipping, but also small, American design and fabrication companies with proven track records. This gives us the best of both worlds, allowing us to combine inexpensive components with custom components where appropriate.\n\nShould manufacturing issues arise, we have several options for local fabrication companies in Pittsburgh and Chicago. Finding alternate sources for the custom parts is not as difficult as it was ten years ago. These digitally-driven fabrication methods are now common industry standards. \n\nIn addition, we have both spent decades providing technical solutions to creative problems. Pablo was trained as an architect and designer and has spent over a decade working with digital fabrication equipment. Golan is a new media artist who has created and deployed robust, technically sophisticated installations all over the world. We are counting on that experience to provide both solid logistical planning and readiness to solve problems as they occur.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #34", "update_userinfo": "NeoLucida XL: One week in, and new Rewards to help students draw!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "NeoLucida XL is here!", "update_content": "The Mid-2014 NeoLucida Pre-Order: through May 31\nIt's back!

It is extremely low budget, and relatively high concept. How is a story of space warfare between two high-technology civilizations to be achieved, doing justice to its original, on a super-low budget?\nPartially because most of the work will be done by students -- ideally my production students at the University of Colorado (you can see samples of their extraordinary work here) -- under the occasional supervision of professionals from the industry. But mainly because Harry Harrison's original novel - his counterblast to STAR$HIP TROOPERS - has to be made this way. It's told not from the flight deck but from the engine room: or to be more exact, the fusebays, where ranks of expendable Fusetenders Sixth Class wait to replace burned-out fuses, or die.\nProduction Artwork\nHarry's story of grunts - and one grunt in particular - in the lowest echelon of the war machine - can readily be recreated in an academic environment. ATLAS, home of the University of Colorado's Film Studies Program, features concrete staircases and windowless basement corridors which already resemble the corridors and fusebays of the Good Ship Fanny Hill. The Visual Arts Complex features asymmetrical hallways and strange machines. Tunnels beneath the campus provide us with the bowels of Helior, the Imperial Planet. The Engineering Dept. has space suits and a mock-up Space Shuttle replacement.\nNCAR\nBut no one location is essential to the picture! Bill's one trip \"above ground\" to Helior's Walled Gardens, can be recreated at a venue like the NCAR (seen above - and also featured in the sf comedy Sleeper).\nProf. Dave Klaus dresses me in one of our costumes\nVeniola, the swamp planet, where Bill is sent to a penal colony, will be shot in an appropriately green location.\nSome sixty pages of BILL THE GALACTIC HERO will be shot live action, with space-suited actors, on 35mm black and white film. About ten pages will be shot on a stage using front or rear projection.\nPurple Dart with Coal-sack Nebula Cluster\nThere are about ten (overlapping) pages of model shots and special effects, including glimpses of the Voids of Space. We will build our own models, under the supervision of visual effects pros from Tippett Studios (ROBOCOP, STARSHIP TROOPERS, MAD GOD) and Collateral Image (who created the visual effects for REPO CHICK and STRAIGHT TO HELL RETURNS). My colleague Victor Jendras will, I hope, supervise the creation of the medals, and the production design.\nBILL THE GALACTIC HERO begins and ends as an animated cartoon. The anime department, run, I hope, by my colleague Chris Pearce, will also create Eager Chinger, the tiny reptilian spy.\nThe live action - actors in space suits in staircases, sound stages, and swamps - can be accomplished within twenty days. But the \"VFX\" part of the project does not unfold quickly. This is an old-fashioned science fiction film of the technological level of ICARUS XB1: it will use real models, and matte shots.\nSpacesuit sketches\nSince we're outputting a digital version of the film - your DVD or BluRay disc, or download - post production will involve some CGI - computer generated images. How else to achieve our ray gun blasts, or interplanetary lasers? But we aim to keep our technology rooted in the mid 1960s, when the greatest of all science fiction films (DR STRANGELOVE, ICARUS, and 2001) were made with three-dimensional analog models, and when Harry Harrison conceived and wrote BILL THE GALACTIC HERO.\nOur model-building, plate-shooting and costume work will be done this fall The main shoot of BILL THE GALACTIC HERO will be in early spring. But post-production will take longer than that! One of the things I try to teach my students is the \"impossible triangle of quality\": the one whereby any manufactured item - including a film - can be made good, and fast, but not cheap; fast, and cheap, but not good; or good, and cheap, but not fast. A quality independent film aims for the last of these three. We will endeavor to post a rough cut - viewable with a unique download key - in the Summer of 2014, and to ship the more important costumes and models when we're sure they aren't needed. BILL THE GALACTIC HERO - its sound design and music under the supervision of Academy Award winner Richard Beggs and film composer Dan Wool - will be finished by December 2014.\nHonorable Enlistment Award\nBILL UPDATE #1 - STARSHIP TROOPERS PRODUCER JOINS UP!\nWhat a pleasure to report that Jon Davison has signed up both as a project backer and to come and supervise BILL's preproduction, here in Boulder. Jon and I first worked together on a project called WAR BABY (unmade); for years we struggled with our own original version of MARS ATTACKS! (unmade also). We finally managed to make a film in 2007 -- SEARCHERS 2.0. So this will (I hope) be our second successful collaboration! Jon has even refused to accept money for gas. He will drive here from Telluride in the fall and guide us as we set up our production plan.\nBoss Jon Davison and team, on the set of Searchers 2.0\n(That's Jon in the dead centre of the above photograph, against a magnificent backdrop of buttes.) I remember talking to him on the phone as he was leaving Hollywood for STARSHIP TROOPERS' location shoot in Wyoming -- at the head of the biggest convoy of grip and electrical equipment trucks the industry had ever seen. Far from the grandeur of leading his wagon train, he will be welcome at our humble campfire.\nThanks for reading this -- and please, if you can, support this authentically independent independent film! I shall be grateful for your backing at any level, and look forward to sharing the details of BILL's progress with you as the film unfolds. Only backers will know the true and grisly details of this production. Only with your support, can BILL be made!\nForward to Victory Starburst, designed by Victor Jendras", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe risks associated with any film project are two-fold: that the film may not be completed. and that the film will be bad. The first of these risks is minimal: a filmmaker's reputation depends on his or her ability to deliver a finished film; all the features I've directed have been completed and distributed, in theaters, on television, or on DVD. The schedule we've established for BILL gives us the lengthy post-production period which a good science fiction film needs (and which the panicked schedules of contemporary Hollywood no longer permit).\n\nThe danger of making a bad film is always there! In the project's favor is the original material - Harry Harrison's amazing book - and the screenplay, which Harry and I were working on when he died, and which is available for your perusal as a $10 Kickstarter reward. The risk-averse might also worry about the budget, which is by Hollywood standards amazingly low. But I'm used to making low-budget pictures: you might want to check out my book, X Films, which deals with ten features I directed, and goes into detail as to the budgets and how they were spent. \n\nRaising our funding now gives us plenty of time to buy film stock, buy and doctor our costumes, and prepare for a fall/spring shoot. I'm confident in the talents of student crews and actors -- and my confidence is reinforced because professionals I've worked with many times will also be around to keep things up to our usual exacting standards!\n\nCould BILL, THE GALACTIC HERO run late? Given our decent post-production period this seems unlikely. Will fulfillment of the rewards be delayed? Highly unlikely. Once the shoot is officially over we can release the leads' spacesuits and regalia. When the visual effects photography is done we can release the spacecraft and refreshment robots.

Level up as you succeed, lose HP as you fail, earn money to buy weapons and armor. Read more. The project is open source, and is live.\nWhat The Campaign Funds\nWebsite bug fixes like whoa!\nUndo, custom time-zones, tags / categories, due dates\nCompletion of the iPhone & Android apps\nMounts\nIntegration with some primary services (Google Tasks and Calendar, Evernote, etc).\nSince the Kickstarter began, the following features have been added:\nParties\nPets\nAvatar customization\nBetter armor customization\nCharacter Customizations\nThe funds go towards hiring guns to help me complete the above tasks. Two web developers (including myself), a pixel artist, systems administrator, and mobile developer. In the days Habit's been on Kickstarter, this team has been officially formed and ready to start working if the Kickstarter tips and I can start paying them :)\nStretch Goals\nLooks like we're about to tip my friends! How about some extra features with that surplus? If the campaign hits the following amounts we'll move these features to the forefront of development:\n$28,000\nAwards and Badges\nShow off your achievements (including your backer tier) to your friends.\nProfiles\nA modal showing your profile pic, badges, blurb, websites, and gear. Others view this when clicking your avatar.\nTags\nCategorize your tasks, including a visibility filter on tags. Will also solve the \"custom columns\" & \"time blocks\" (morning, afternoon) requests.\nTranslations\nWe have a whole queue of translators waiting to help us!\nPriority Multiplier\nMultiply your tasks on a difficulty scale.\nTask Icons\nLittle visuals next to your tasks' text.\n$33,000\nCross-Profile Challenges\nAssign Habits, Dailies, Todos, Rewards to your friends & family.\nQuests\nParticipate in \"Streak\" challenges (eg, 10 days bike to work) to earn extra GP/Exp and item drops! This one will be fun :)\n$38,000\nThe Class System\nDepending on the types of tasks you complete, you gain Attack, Defense, Agility, or Intelligence. Those determine which class you become (Warrior, Rogue, Mage) which in turn effects how you interact with the game.\nRewards & Tokens\nT-shirt: Along the lines of this, still customizing. Stay tuned for styles and options. +$5 international shipping.\nTokens are used to purchase digital items - avatar customizations, tabards, mounts, pets, item modifiers, emergency potions, etc. We want all features and stats-modifiers to be free, but any \"flare\" customizations and fringe bits will be bought with tokens. Basically, they make you look cooler than your friends! See #1 of Business Model.\nIntegration: Google Tasks, Astrid, GCal, Fitbit, etc.\nThe ultimate goal of Habit is to plug into all your current tools - RescueTime, Fitbit, Wunderlist, MyFitnessPal, etc (see the full bucket-list, and cast your vote!). Habit has an API for such integration, and is currently in use by a Chrome extension which monitors your unproductive web activity (read: Reddit, Facebook, etc), as well as by Pomodoro scripts.\nLinks\nWebsite\nBlog\nTrello (feature requests)\nGithub (bugs & code)\nReddit", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n* There are a lot of great feature requests!

We also invited Cameron Smith out on tour to capture the band behind the scenes in Fort Worth, Boston, Washington, D.C., and New York.\n\nHere is a rough cut Patrick Cone put together of the intro of the concert documentary for this kickstarter campaign:\n3.  \"NEW\" Full Length Studio Album  (May 2013)\nThe band has recorded 4 songs thus far.  If you listen closely after the kickstarter trailer begins you can hear a snippet of an unmixed and unmastered song.\nThe following remains to be completed and/or paid for in order to release the studio album:\n\nstudio costs\nengineer fee\nproducer fee\nmixing fee\nmastering fee\nartwork fee\nphoto shoot/photographer cost\nmanufacturing\npromotion/advertising\npublic relations\nvideos\n\n4.  Touring  (2013)\nThe Polyphonic Spree intend to tour extensively in 2013.\nCosts associated with touring include:\nBus lease\nTrailer lease\nBusdriver\nGas & other various bus expenses\nAirfare (when touring abroad)\nCrew:  TM/FOH Engineer, Monitor Engineer, Technician, etc.\nBand Salaries\nBand/Crew Per Diems\nAlong the way we will be updating backers, offering exclusives for those who have contributed, adding rewards that we dream up or unearth, and maybe even telling you a joke or two.  Our reward packages run the gamut from basically a preorder to joining us on stage so there is something for EVERYONE.  Most importantly check back OFTEN and PLEASE share this with fellow dreamers.\nTHANKS.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe will have a team including the band and volunteers to get your rewards and gifts to you in a timely manner. Once release dates are firm we intend to get all backers their audio/video items BEFORE anyone else gets their hands on them.

As a publisher, we've continued to raise the bar in regards to production value and art, which is a bar we strive to meet or exceed with every release.\n\nAs we continue to grow as a company, not only in size but also in developing new games, Kickstarter has allowed us the opportunity to step up our production values, without having to take our production overseas. This is something we weren't able to do prior to Kickstarter. Kickstarter gives us a reach that we just didn't have before.\n\nWe do our very best to mitigate any risks associated with manufacturing games. We've built solid relationships with several state-side manufacturing companies, and know what to expect regarding quality and turnaround time.

You don't love the annoyances that come with tile placement games, however, like crooked rows, sloppy placement of the tiles, games ruined because someone elbows a whole section of tiles out of place reaching for the chips, etc.\nKinico Game Grids solves all of those problems.  If you haven't already, watch the video to see exactly how the patent-pending Game Grids work.\nReasons You Will Never Play Without Game Grids Again Once You've Tried Them:\nNo more crooked rows of tiles\nTiles are easier to pick up and move\nWith minimal effort, games can be paused, moved (to another room/table), and resumed with all game tiles in their correct spot\nYou can play off the edge of the table\nMuch easier to play in grass, on thick carpet, or on a blanket or the sand at the beach\nYour game won't be ruined if the table gets bumped\nIt's super-easy to place, pick up, and move a tile that's surrounded by other tiles\nMakes it much easier to see if two pieces in Tile Chess are in the same row or diagonal if they're not close to each other\nAll tiles are exactly where they're supposed to be, all the time!\nArk of the Covenant\nAnother great thing about the Game Grids is that they work with many different games!  Basically, any game that has tiles the exact same size as Carcassonne will work. \nCarcassonne\nRight now, the list of compatible games includes...\nCarcassonne\nAlhambra\nTile Chess\nArk of the Covenant\nBatt'l Kha'os\nTile Chess\nAnd any \"Print and Play\" game that uses square tiles will work as well, like...\nMicropul\nWend\nWheels of Steel\nSnake Pit\nTiles\nBatt'l Kha'os\nHow many Game Grids do I need?\nIt depends on which games you play. \nYou need a set of 9 Game Grids if you play...\nBatt'l Kha'os\nArk of the Covenant\nAlhambra (with no more than 3 players)\nCarcassonne (base game only)\nMight also work for Tile Chess for 2-3 players, depending on how spread out your game gets.\n9 Game Grids will hold 144 tiles.\nYou need a set of 16 Game Grids if you play...\nCarcassonne (With expansions)\nAlhambra (with more than 3 players)\nTile Chess (with more than 3 players)\n16 Game Grids will hold 256 tiles.\nYou need a set of 25 Game Grids if you play...\nMASSIVE games of Carcassonne.  If you like to combine several base games and several expansions together and play a humongous game of Carcassonne, then you'll need 25 Game Grids. \n25 Game Grids will hold 400 tiles.\nYou need a set of 36 Game Grids  if you play...\nThe largest games of Carcassonne anyone has ever seen.  If you play games this large, than you definitely need Game Grids to keep every tile in place.  \n36 Game Grids has enough spots for 576 tiles!  Sweet!\nManufacturer's prototype with Carcassonne\nWhy are there so many different reward levels?\nI wanted to make it easy for everyone to find exactly the kind of reward they wanted.  I also didn't want to make anyone buy a type of reward that included an item they didn't want.  Basically, there are three main items you can choose for rewards. \nGame Grids- In sets of 9, 16, 25, or 36\nA velvet drawstring pouch\nThe pouch will have my website's logo printed on it.  It's big.  I usually play with the base game, the mini-expansion, and the Inns and Cathredrals expansion.  It holds all 102 Carcassonne tiles, and is still barely half-full!  So if you have a pouch for tile games that's too small, this pouch should do the job, and still have room to spare.\nThe Velvet Pouch\nRubber Feet\nThe rubber feet are perfect for making sure your Game Grids, game board, dice tower, miniatures, and/or other gaming products don't slide around on your table.  They are very small, and very thin.  You won't even notice they are there!\nFour rubber feet on the bottom of a Game Grid\nClose-up of one rubber foot\nI've arranged the rewards so that you can choose whatever combination of rewards you want.  So, for example, if you want a set of 16 Game Grids with 64 rubber feet, you can choose that reward.  If you want 9 Game Grids and a pouch, you can choose that.  If you don't play tile placement games, but want to support this project anyway, you can choose a reward like a velvet pouch, or a set of 50 rubber feet, and so on.  Be sure to read the reward description so you know how many Grids to order, based on what game you like to play.\nAlhambra\nThe Game Grids will be made with a type of hard plastic that the manufacturer has assured me will not warp.  They will be black.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main challenge in completing this project is the amount of time it will take to organize the products and ship all the packages. First of all, I have already located vendors for supplies like shipping boxes, so I won't be wasting any time scrambling around trying to figure that out at the last minute.\n\nAlso, members of my family have volunteered to assist with the packaging tasks when that time comes. And as a teacher, I will have some upcoming holiday times where I will be able to devote my time to the project 24/7.\n\n\nAs far as the challenges that go along with actually producing the Game Grids, I'm not worried about that at all. I discussed this project with 11 different manufacturers, and found a company that communicates extremely well, produced a great prototype grid (quickly!), and had great references. I have total confidence that they will be able to produce high quality Game Grids.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "dave kinzer\n2 created \u00b7 6 backed\nI am a husband, father, music teacher, and author.

When I was a little girl, I thought the word, \"engineering\" was nerdy and intimidating and just for boys. I've since learned I was so wrong. Engineers build all the important things we use every day...things that make our lives better. The scary truth is that only 11% of engineers are women and girls start losing interest in science as young as age 8!  This is our chance to change that statistic.\nI'm creating GoldieBlox to inspire girls the way Legos and Erector sets have inspired boys, for over 100 years, to develop an early interest and skill set in engineering. It's time to motivate our girls to help build our future.\nMeet GoldieBlox\nGoldieBlox is a construction toy + book series starring Goldie, the kid inventor who loves to build. As girls read along, they get to build what Goldie builds. \nTarget age range: 5-9\nThe initial set includes:\nStorybook: \"GoldieBlox and the Spinning Machine\": This is the intro to Goldie, where she builds a belt drive to spin all her friends.\nCharacter Figurines: Nacho (Goldie's beloved dog), Benjamin Cranklin (the cat with an attitude), Katinka (the dolphin ballerina), Phil (the sloth), and Flavio (the bear from Brazil).  \nConstruction Set: 1 pegboard, 5 wheels, 10 axles, 5 blocks, 1 crank, 1 ribbon and 5 washers.\nBook+Toy #2 includes the \"GoldieBlox Goes to the Parade\" storybook + character figures + construction set pieces to build a parade float vehicle.\nBook+Toy #3 includes the \"GoldieBlox and the Treehouse\" storybook + character figurines + construction set pieces to build a pulley elevator.\nAll of the construction pieces in each set will be inter-compatible. Book+Toys 2 & 3 introduce medium and long axles and different lengths of ribbon. With this many construction pieces, the play opportunities are absolutely endless.\nTo get the entire series, pledge at the [GET THE WHOLE GANG -- $90] level. If we reach our $400,000 stretch goal, then we can ramp up production on Book+Toys 2 & 3 to have them shipped by April '13 and May '13, respectively. If we do not reach this goal, we will still be able to produce them...it'll just take a little longer (by August '13).\nAnd for our tech-loving girls, Goldie's stories will be available as free e-book downloads for iPhone and iPad with narration, animation and tutorial videos to truly bring Goldie to life and lend a hand to girls who aren't quite at Goldie's reading level yet.\nRewards\nThe GoldieBlox TOY\nOriginal prints signed by Debbie\nHacker Hoodie (available in adult sizes only)\nT-shirt (available in kids and adult sizes)\nBringing Goldie to Life\nGoldieBlox has come a long way. I've taken the concept from a drawing in a sketchbook to numerous working prototypes to a real toy sample in just eight short months. I partnered with Cornell researchers to test my prototypes on over 100 kids in over 40 homes and 3 schools. The testing went so well, I decided to take the leap.\nOriginal GoldieBlox prototype\nI've already partnered with an exceptional manufacturer that produced the toy sample you saw in the video. The construction parts will be made out of plastic and foam and they are getting tooled in China right now. Don't worry, I'm avoiding hazardous plastics like PVC to make sure GoldieBlox is safe for children. Plus, I'll be putting the toy through rigorous industry-standard child safety testing before it reaches your door.\nCAD Rendering of GoldieBlox\nI've spent my entire life savings to get it this far. The GoldieBlox book+toy is ready to go...all I need to do is place the production order. (This is where YOU step in.) But in order to do this, the minimum order quantity is 5000 units. Support me in this endeavor, and I will get GoldieBlox into the hands of as many little girls as possible.\nHow did I pull this off, you may ask? Well, my manufacturing is getting set up by a production expert with over 30 years experience in toys; specifically, plastic-injection-mold construction toys. I met him at my last job, a sign yet again from the universe that GoldieBlox was meant to happen. \nI've had some other folks help me out that you may have heard of...the founders of Pictionary, Cranium and Klutz Books as well as the head of toys at IDEO have all lent me their expertise. I am forever indebted to them.\nOnce you've backed me on Kickstarter, you'll get to track the progress of GoldieBlox as she gets created every step of the way on www.goldieblox.com. PLUS, you'll get to learn HOW she gets made and all the engineering principles behind it. \nDesigned for girls\nGoldieBlox goes beyond \"making it pink\" to appeal to girls. I spent a year doing in-depth research into gender differences and child development to create the concept. My big \"aha\"? Boys have strong spatial skills, which is why they love construction toys so much. Girls, on the other hand, have superior verbal skills. They love reading, stories, and characters.\nGoldieBlox is the best of both worlds: reading + building. It appeals to girls because they aren't just interested in \"what\" they're building...they want to know \"why.\" Goldie's stories relate to girls' lives. The machines Goldie builds solve problems and help her friends. As girls read along, they want to be like Goldie and do what she does. \nGoldie's toolkit is inspired by common household objects and craft items -- things girls are already familiar with. Plus, the set features soft textures, curved edges and attractive colors which are all innately appealing to girls. Last but not least, the story of Goldie is lighthearted and humorous. It takes the intimidation factor out of engineering and makes it fun and accessible. \nWhat's Next?\nThis Kickstarter project is only the beginning of what I intend to create: an entire SERIES of GoldieBlox building stories where she learns about all kinds of engineering concepts including gears, pulleys, circuits, and even coding. I want to equip girls at each age level to challenge themselves and build their dreams. To me, GoldieBlox isn't a one-off product, oh no. Help me get this first story off the ground, and we will kickstart a movement.\n***Photo credits: Susan Burdick Photography", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #15", "update_userinfo": "Brand new construction toys from GoldieBlox!", "update_content": "Dear Kickstarter backers,\nIt is with great pride today that we unveil a new line of GoldieBlox construction toys that we've spent the last 2 years developing, using all of the insights we've learned over the last 8 years on getting girls excited about STEM.

Sometimes they simply get the project sidetracked and wind up creating disappointment on the backend (creator's focus gets split, project gets delayed), other times, they could sink the project altogether (miscalculation of expenses leads to lack of profit).

The Raytheon U.S. Middle School Students Math Habits Study found that 61% of the students prefer to take out the trash to doing their math homework.\nAccording to the independent Pew Research Center\u2019s 2008 report on video game play, 97% of American teenagers play video games.\nWhat we would like to do is to take the genre of video games that teenagers find very appealing (action/adventure and role playing) and adapt it to create a fun and engaging learning experience for a subject that many find hard and boring.\nAbout the Game\nProblemscape is a role playing game (RPG) that takes a problem-based approach to teaching math. In the first game of the series which is for Algebra, students enter the virtual world of Arithma which is inhabited by Arithmen. Arithmen are small cute creatures \u2013 they are green when they are happy, orange when they are not, and can change to any color for a short period of time. And they love to play paintball ... with a mathematical twist! \nMain story:\nTwo years ago, the Arithmen lived under the guidance of a group of mathematicians known as the Xperts. But one day, the Xperts were kidnapped by the ruthless neighboring nation of Literia. And the Arithmen let their city fall apart. The player is a journalist who enters the city to do a story but ends up helping the Arithmen solve their problems. He learns the whole story and decides to help the Arithmen by rescuing the Xperts. As the final quest, the player needs to go through a Literian dungeon with traps and puzzles where the Xperts are held prisoners. The player frees the Xperts and leaves Arithma. She is welcome to return any time to play paint ball or help more Arithmen out.\nProblemscape will be a cross platform game playable on Windows, Mac, iOS and Android.\nWho are we?\nI am Vidya Raman, the founder of Rounded Curriculum Works. I have many years of experience developing educational games. I have a master's degree in Learning, Design, and Technology from Stanford University and have developed games for the websites of Children\u2019s Discovery Museum in San Jose, Lawrence Hall of Science, UC Berkeley, and the Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum in San Jose.\nMy focus is on curriculum development and game design and my goal is to turn a gaming environment into an effective learning environment and still keep it engaging to teenagers. I want to make sure that the game is grounded in research, stays close to core content standards, and does not turn out to be an animated version of a text book. I plan to share all the research I do through my blog.\n\nI also have a couple of serious gamers in my design team \u2013 they are the RPG experts and tell me what will work and more importantly what wouldn\u2019t. \nWe use a top-notch offshore game development company to do the things that we ourselves can't do or do fast enough.\nAnd we need you Kickstarters! We are working on our own time, but we need to pay the people who are helping with the development. We are asking for $10,000 to help us with the first phase of the project \u2013 to create the 3d assets, interface elements and parts of the city for a prototype. Our goal is to have a working prototype with one level ready for demo at the annual NCTM (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics) conference in April 2013.\nWhy should you help?\nYou mean, other than for the satisfaction of helping create a cool RPG that also helps students get better at math?\nFor $10: We will send all contributors a thank you card with a personal heartfelt thank you message. If you like, we'll also give you a free copy of our speed math game for iphones or ipads that we developed as a warm up to this project.\nFor $15: You'll get the $10 rewards plus a jotter made with recycled material\nFor $25: You'll get the $15 rewards and also get an all natural jute tote bag.\nFor $50:  You'll get the $25 rewards and your name will go in the game credits and on our website as an early supporter of the project.\nFor $75: You'll get the $50 rewards + a desk calendar that says 'Thank you for helping create a next generation learning game' goes into the pile of goodies\nFor $100: You'll get the $50 rewards +\nan organic cotton logo t-shirt\na set of 3 wallpapers of the game art that has the message: I helped create a next generation learning game.\nFor $200: You'll get the $100 rewards +\na heavyweight pullover cotton hoodie\na pdf of the game art.\nFor $500: You'll get the $200 rewards +\na book of the game art \nget listed as an executive producer of the game in our website and the game credits.\nFor $1000: All of the $500 rewards and you can be an Xpert in the game. The city of Arithma will have statues of Xperts that will give timely help/advice to the player on gameplay or the math. The Xpert will be made in your image and given a name of your choosing (with some restrictions, naturally). There will be 2 Xperts in the prototype.\nFrom $2 up: If you don't care much for the rewards but are just a kind philanthropist who only wants to see this game developed, please contribute whatever you can. You will still get a thank you card from us whether you like it or not.\n--------------\nRewards Update\nIn response to requests from some of the backers, I would like to add that a download of the prototype and the game when it is finished, will be available to all backers of the projects. \nA big thanks to all our supporters!

Players truck to various locations around America's Heartland, picking up and dropping off goods using matching cards from their hands. All locations have native goods that require fewer cards to load; other locations may pay a premium for those goods but may also require more fuel - and time - to get there with the cargo. With limited space in each trailer and only five cards in hand at a time, players will have to expertly manage their resources, as well as play the odds and press their luck to be the best trucker on the road.\nClick Here to Pin It!\nThe Great Heartland Hauling Co. will offer a lot of replay value through the use of cards to create a variable board set-up each game. The game will include 60 goods cubes, 4 thick cardboard trucks, and 46 resource cards - required for pick-up and delivery - that are drawn from a shared draft board, as well as 19 fuel cards, which are used to move about the Heartland. The cards and components will be of the same high quality as in Carnival, the first release from Dice Hate Me Games. The box size will also be the same, so you can easily take it with you on the road!\nThe Great Heartland Hauling Co. is a game for 2 to 4 players, ages 10 and up, and designed by Jason Kotarski. Hear more about Jason's design process and the development of the game on Episode 33 of The State of Games.\nIf you'd like to dig deeper into The Great Heartland Hauling Co., you can download the rules right here. Just bear in mind that we're still refining things a bit to make sure they are the best and clearest they can be. Also, we can always make the rulebook longer to make room for more advanced play and to incorporate some expansion ideas (with more components) that have been in development for awhile - if there's enough interest. Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.\nWe'll be working on a video tutorial to show exactly how you play, step-by-step, so be sure to check back for updates over the next couple of weeks.\nAchieving our base funding goal ensures that Dice Hate Me Games will be able to publish The Great Heartland Hauling Co. with the quality that we all have come to expect. But is the base game all there is to the trucking business? Well... definitely not!\nWe've reached our first stretch goal: The super sweet Truck Stops Inspansion! We're now adding 12 more cards to the box! The Truck Stop cards are randomized each game and allow players to purchase upgrades for their trucks; these upgrades grant players special abilities to give them an edge during the game.\nFor more information on our first stretch goal, check out Updated #5 right here!\nAnd now we've reached our second stretch goal - 18wheeples! That's right, we're adding four wooden truck meeples to every box of The Great Heartland Hauling Co!\nFor more information about our second stretch goal, check out Update #7 right here!\nAnd now we've reached the The Long Haul! Our final stretch has been reached, and we're making the game even bigger, with support for a fifth player and some new kinds of Locations cards!\nThis expansion for The Great Heartland Hauling Co. will not be included in the final retail version of the game, so make sure to pledge and then grab some friends to pledge, too! For more information about our second stretch goal, check out Update #10 right here!\n\"I don't know of another pickup-and-deliver game that fits into this same category of game length or weight, so The Great Heartland Hauling Co. is pretty unique in the hobby. It's a filler-length game that still manages to 'deliver' both with its depth and how well it pulls off the core mechanic.\" - Chris Norwood, GamerChris\n\"The Great Heartland Hauling Co. can be a fun and light game or a very serious and competitive one, depending on who you are playing with. When I played with the Parent and Child geeks, the game was about moving as fast as you could, and the players more or less stayed out of each others way. When I played with the Gamer Geeks, players were stealing goods out from under other players and hording them to ensure other players couldn\u2019t score points. In both cases, the game was well received and highly enjoyed. Although, I\u2019ll never be able to look at ham cubes on a salad again and not think 'pink pig chunks'.' - Cyrus, Father Geek\n\"It\u2019s really a game about careful planning, good timing, and a little luck combined with adapting your strategy. Your end game is really important, but be careful to get there at the right time. This makes it an interesting game. It\u2019s one I look forward to playing again.\" - John Moller, Cartrunk Entertainment\n\"The balance between a quick game and feeling like a game was actually played is difficult, and the designer did a great job of getting the balance right for this game. I borrowed the game later for a two player game with just Sam and myself, and I had a really hard time returning the prototype to Chris. I wanted to take the game home just so I could play it more.\" - Ken Grazier, Geek-Craft\n\"I got to play Heartland Hauling at WBC. It's like a light version of Steam. It's good.\" - Josh Edwards, Board Game Reviews by Josh\nKickstarter provides a platform for direct consumers to get The Great Heartland Hauling Co. shipped directly to their door before it hits the store shelves. As a retailer, though, you may reserve copies of the game through Game Salute.\nWithout our Kickstarter Backers, Dice Hate Me Games would not be able to bring quality games to market. To show our respect and appreciation, DHMG promises that backer copies of The Great Heartland Hauling Co. will be shipped out before copies are available for purchase at retailers or conventions. DHMG also pledges to keep all backers informed at every step in the development, printing and delivery processes. We love staying in touch with all of our supporters, so please never hesitate to contact us with questions and concerns.\nHello again! Many of you have been on this incredible journey with us since our first Kickstarter project, Carnival, and stayed buckled in through the incredible ride of VivaJava: The Coffee Game. For that, we are forever grateful.\nAnd now it's time to help us navigate through the highways and biways of yet another project - The Great Heartland Hauling Co. Your pledges and support have been instrumental in keeping the engines of Dice Hate Me Games   purring like a well-oiled machine, and your continued support can help us to maintain the dream in which we - and more than a few of you - continue to believe.

It's no substitute for a complete rulebook, but it gives a good sense of the flow of the game.\nCheapass Games Returns.\nEurope. Summer. 1997. You and your so-called friends have discovered two problems with a common solution: mad cows in England, and unexploded bombs in France. In Unexploded Cow, you will round up mad cows, march them through the French countryside, and make a buck blowing them up.\nCheapass Games hasn't printed anything in about 5 years. Our head honcho, James Ernest, got distracted by other things. (You can read more about that here.) Now it's time to return this company to life, with a deluxe reprint of one of our best selling games, Unexploded Cow.\nUnexploded Cow is a quirky, lightweight card game about using mad cows from England to clear unexploded bombs in France. It was designed by James Ernest and Paul Peterson, and was first published in black and white in 2001. You can learn more about the game by downloading the rules at http://cheapass.com/freegames/uxcow. (Note: Some rules are still changing.)\nCheapass Games are usually in a cheaper format, but we decided this game deserved the full-color treatment. A perfect set of money (100, 200, and 500 bills) is hard to come by, and dice are cheap. So we decided to go ahead and include all the parts, just like the grown-up game companies do.\nThis deluxe edition of Unexploded Cow will help Cheapass bounce back from years of doing nothing. So, by investing in this game, you're also helping us reboot the company, reprint some classics, and make brand new games.\nSounds like fun? Please help us out! Read through the pledge levels and find one that's right for you. For $25 or more, you'll get a copy of the game, and any amount helps us get Cheapass Games back on its feet.\nJust Added: Unexploded Cow Button Men\nIf you like Button Men, you can now get a full set of the yet-to-be-created Unexploded Cow Button Men expansion (six new characters with a yet-to-be created special die type) by adding $15 to any pledge in this campaign. We have also created a new $15 pledge level that includes just the Button Men and a copy of the Unexploded Cow PDF.  \nThe six characters in this set will be available at retail, but backers will also receive two rares, Thaddeus and Buckley, the two cow buttons we made in conjunction with Impact Miniatures. \nNew Custom Die:\nFor our final week, we've decided to add a few cool items, for those of you who would like to pledge a little more. The first item is a custom cow die, which can be added for $2 to any pledge where we are already shipping something. (Sorry, PDF-only backers can't get it). \nThe die isn't made, but if you ignore the design and the color, it will look just like this.\nMore about Sponsoring a Cow\nCow sponsorships are going fast! More than half of the individual cows in the game are already spoken for, and of course this pledge level can't be extended or repeated. So if you're on the fence about sponsoring a cow, grab the bull by the horns and throw your hat in the ring. Or something like that.\nHere's what the \"Sponsor a Cow\" package gets you:\nA listing on the Cow Sponsors page at www.cheapass.com, and in the game rulebook\nA high-quality printout of your cow artwork, suitable for framing, along with a certificate of sponsorship and an extra copy of your card from the game (in case you want to frame them together)\nConsulting privileges on the naming of the cow. The cows, by and large, will have names that sound good on British soldiers in WWI. Work with us, and together we will name your cow\nA copy of the game (As with other levels, if you're outside the US, please add $15 to cover international shipping, or $10 for Canada or Mexico)\nMany of these levels are already sold out. Act quickly if there is a cow you really want. For more details on the cow list, or on the game rules in general, you can download a PDF of the current edition of Unexploded Cow, at http://cheapass.com/freegames/uxcow. Note that rules about specific cows might change (the in-game dollar values, mostly) during our final round of playtesting, so the summaries in the Rewards column might be slightly off.\nWhy We Need Your Help\nPrinting games is expensive, as you might expect. Short press runs are impossible. So, we are trying to raise enough money to finance a reasonable press run of Unexploded Cow, with a unit cost that lets us sell the game into hobby retail. Most of what we produce will end up in retail stores, aside from those copies that we \"pre-sell\" via Kickstarter.\nStarting a company from scratch can be daunting, and even though Cheapass Games was once a strong presence in the hobby market, we need a boost to get things started again. So even if you don't contribute to our Kickstarter campaign, we still need your help. Ask for Cheapass Games at your local game store, and let them know we're back on the scene. Tell your friends about this Kickstarter campaign. Soon, with your help, the unique Cheapass brand of quirky, lightweight, and inexpensive games will be back in stores around the world.\nStretch Goals (Updated 9/6)\nThe more we raise with this campaign, the better we can make this game. We are still negotiating with our printers to get the best price on some of the components below, but your support will make them all possible. \nStretch Goal 1: Full Color Rulebook (Yes!) Our basic goal of $10k lets us print the bare minimum \"deluxe\" version of Unexploded Cow. Color isn't absolutely necessary for the rulebook. But it's always nice. Now that we have reached 15k, we can afford to make the rulebook look better with full-color printing and glossy paper.\nStretch Goal 2: Better Artwork (Yes!) We have budgeted the minimum amount of art from Cheyenne, a talented and busy human. Now, with a larger art budget, we can have more detail in the backgrounds, more polish on the figures, and more variety in the poses and uniforms. Thanks for helping us cross the \"Better Artwork\" threshold!\nStretch Goal 3: More Cow Art. We made it! Now we have even more in our art budget, so Cheyenne can add even more art. At this level, all the cows will get their own individual pieces of art (four different \"Sturdy Cows,\" for example, rather than just one).\nStretch Goal 4: Printing in the USA. Most tabletop game manufacturers produce their goods overseas, because it\u2019s cheaper in short runs. But if we reach this level of funding, we can afford to print a larger press run, and make Unexploded Cow in the USA. Honestly, it's only a few percentage points different, but we would really rather print at home if we can afford it.\nStretch Goal 5: Tokens for Money. Paper money is cheaper than tokens, but tokens (that is, little cardboard poker chips) would make the money easier to handle, and make the game easier to play. If we reach this goal, we will be able to afford tokens, instead of paper money, in the finished game.\nStretch Goal 6: Our Next Game is Funded! Cheapass Games will soon be making new, original games in its familiar low-cost format. These games will likely retail for $10 to $12, and will contain the cheapest possible components (and not all the generic pieces you need). If we reach $60k with this Kickstarter campaign, then our next cheap game will be funded, and we'll also be able to add new pledge levels that allow you to get a copy of that game.\nStretch Goal 7: Our 3rd Game is Funded! Just like at $60k, the $80k stretch goal means we have enough to print TWO new low-cost titles. We'll add pledge levels for players who want to get both games. And we will be able to print two great new Cheapass Games without going back to Kickstarter. \nStretch Goal 8: Who Knows? It seems unlikely that we'll reach 100k, but if we get close to that number, we'll think of something dramatically cool to add here.\nKeep Checking Back!\nAs this campaign develops, keep checking back for previews of art, new and interesting promotions, stretch goals, and news about the game.

We made a movie! It's done! Finished! Coming out on Digital/VOD platforms on August 21 and DVD on October 23rd!\nYou may not have heard of it but THE SELLING has played at over twenty-five film festivals, garnered tons of awards, and gotten rave reviews from various websites and blogs including The Huffington Post, Fangoria, Ain't It Cool News, and Filmmaker Magazine. \nBut the most meaningful responses we've gotten have been from audience members who tell us things like \"This is the funniest movie I've ever seen,\" \"I wish Hollywood made movies like this,\" and \"This movie should be in theaters.\" \nUnfortunately, unless your movie has big name movie stars it's next to impossible to get a theatrical release because (let's face it) most people are more likely to see [Insert Movie Star Name Here] in a bad movie than to take a chance on an independent movie with actors they don't know.\nMost people. Not YOU.\nThat's why we're asking you to help us get our little six year old brain child out of the house and into the world.\nWhat is THE SELLING?\nTHE SELLING is a supernatural comedy about a real estate agent trying to sell a haunted house. It gives a fresh take on the classic \"scare comedies\" of Abbott and Costello and Don Knotts' THE GHOST AND MR. CHICKEN with subtle references to modern horror classics such as THE EXORCIST, THE HAUNTING,  THE AMITYVILLE HORROR, and (of course) THE SHINING.  It has been compared favorably to such comedy greats as GHOSTBUSTERS and SHAUN OF THE DEAD...by people other than our family members. \nIt stars Gabriel Diani and Etta Devine (ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN [ROBOTIC EDITION])... \nGabriel Diani as Richard Scarry and Production Designer Katrin Eder\nEtta Devine as Ginger Sparks\nJanet Varney (THE LEGEND OF KORRA, JV CLUB PODCAST)... \nJanet Varney as Mary Best\nJonathan Klein (HOTEL FOR DOGS)... \nJonathan Klein as Dave Ross\nNancy Lenehan (WORST WEEK, CATCH ME IF YOU CAN)... \nJonathan Klein, Janet Varney, Etta Devine and Nancy Lenehan\n...and Barry Bostwick (THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW, SPIN CITY).\nBarry Bostwick as Father Jimmy\n It also features appearances by Simon Helberg (THE BIG BANG THEORY)... \nSimon Helberg\nHarry Groener (BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER)...\nHarry Groener\n ...and Jocelyn Towne (I AM I). \nJocelyn Towne\nThe film's Director, Producer and Executive Producer is Emily Lou. \nEmily Lou\nThe Director of Photography is Matthias Schubert.\nMatthias Schubert\nMatthias Schubert\nEditor and Robot Jim designer Chad Meserve\nEveryone who worked on the movie is awesome. You can check out the whole cast and crew list here. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1552214/\nWhat are these \"distribution expenses\" you speak of?\nMaking movies is expensive. And we made one! Yay! However that is barely even the beginning. Every good thing that happens after the movie is done from festivals, to foreign sales, to VOD sales to DVD sales actually costs a ton more money. The movie has to bear all the up front costs of all the technology these companies need to sell the movie, and the money they get from selling the movie first goes to all of their costs, which are significant. The more good things happen the more money we have to pay, and the movie is the last entity in a very long line to get any of the money that comes in.  \nWhat are you going to do with the money?\nGreat question. The money we are raising will be used to pay for a series of screenings and defray the costs of physical delivery of the film to distributors and VOD platforms. Specifically:\n* Theater rentals in Chico, San Francisco, Virginia, and Los Angeles\n* Costs of making Digibeta copies of the film with Closed Caption files embedded on them for VOD platforms\n* Purchasing DVDs from our distributor to sell on our website and for incentives\n* Capturing iphone, laptop, and HD TV sized digital versions of the film from our masters for sale on our website and for incentives\n* Website refresh to create an online store, integrate new key art, and buttons to take website visitors to other platforms that carry the film\n* Printing posters\n* Shipping/delivery cost of incentives\nWhat about these Tickets?\nYou can purchase tickets here on Kickstarter to our limited theatrical premier. If you want more than one ticket multiply $10 by the number of tickets and pay that. Then when you select your incentive choose the ticket for the location you want. We'll know that if you pledged $20 you want two tickets and so on...\nIf you want to add a ticket or multiple tickets to another incentive simply add $10 per ticket and then send us a message about it. You can do it through the kickstarter message system or through info@DianiAndDevine.com. \nBecause Kickstarter allows you to change your pledge while the campaign is running you can always add tickets later if your city pops up. We'll let you know when that happens. \nSo far we're showing in Chico, CA at The Pageant Theatre on August 25 around 8:30, in Los Angeles at the Egyptian Theater October 22nd, the Opera Plaza Cinema in San Francisco on October 20, and somewhere in Virginia and Wichita (we'll add these incentives when the dates and places are finalized). We're going to have little after parties in bars or restaurants after all these screenings. If you're a backer at any level we'd love you to come!\nWhat are your other incentives? \nWe're offering the DVD of the movie, digital downloads in phone, laptop and huge fancy TV sizes. Beware for those outside of the US or Canada: the DVD will be Region 1. \nWe're also giving everybody a special Kickstarter Exclusive Commentary Track you can listen to over the movie. Yes, it's for everybody! Even people who aren't getting the movie. \nYou can get the super cute Grumpy Owl's t-Shirt by http://Deadworry.etsy.com that Gabriel Diani's character Richard Scarry wears in the film. A Grumpy Family of Owls hand screened on American Apparel Fine Cotton Jersey T-Shirt - 100% combed cotton. Color: Chocolate Brown Sizes: SM, MD, LG, XL, 2XL We'll send you a survey to get your size. \nYou can get this super awesome picture of Barry Bostwick as Commander Ace Hunter in the 1982 action masterpiece MEGAFORCE signed by Barry himself!\nBarry Bostwick as Commander Ace Hunter in MEGAFORCE\nYou can get a sterling silver and Swarovski Crystal bleeding wall necklace from http://Underoakstudios.etsy.com.

If you are going to GenCon, we will be in booth 2051 and will be happy to demo any of our games there!\nVisit www.IndieBoardsAndCards.com to learn about more games from Indie Boards and Cards.\nKeep your eyes out for more exciting kickstarter projects coming soo from Indie Boards and Cards.  If you are a backer - watch for updates to get notified right away when new projects start and get in early for special rewards.\n2nd Story \u2013 a new expansion for Flash Point: Fire Rescue\n2nd Story was created by Lutz Pietschker, one of Flash Point: Fire Rescue\u2019s biggest fans. Lutz is a firefighter in Germany, and helped support Flash Point at Essen 2012. His creation is first of what I hope to be many fan created expansions that Indie Boards and Cards release.\n2nd Story includes two new buildings to use with Flash Point: Fire Rescue. Each building is on two boards, each board representing one floor of the building. The boards are double sided, and mounted and will fit into your Flash Point box.\nAlso included is a token sheet with Ladders, Windows, an explosion marker, extra Doors & POI placement tokens that are added to use in the 2nd Story expansion. Ladders and Stairs provide access to the upper building level, and Windows are a great way of getting in and out of the building without causing structural damage. Combined these making exciting new strategic and tactical choices for firefighters!\nFinally, all the supporters of this expansion will get a set of the new firefighter figures. These oversized miniatures will replace the game\u2019s wooden pawns in the 2nd Edition of Flash Point and help make the game a much more thematic experience. I am really excited to be able to get these figures included in this project, and hope that you\u2019ll be even more excited to play the game with your friends and family once you get them.\n2nd edition - Firefighters, bonus for all supporters\nUrban Structures \u2013 re-release the 1st expansion for Flash Point: Fire Rescue\nUrban Structures was done as a limited release for our kickstarter project last year, and included two new buildings, a new firefighter specialist and some variant rules/scenarios for Flash Point. Feedback has been great, and through kickstarter we hope to be able to release this (and the rescue meeples) again.\nSo if you are so excited about these expansions, why do you need funding to get it made? \n\nThree reasons really. First \u2013 while sales of Flash Point to date have been strong and I am very optimistic that they will continue to get even stronger for the rest of 2012, there just aren\u2019t enough copies out in the market to make printing an expansion economically viable without direct support from kickstarter. The game just isn\u2019t popular enough (yet!) to print 3,000 more copies of Urban Structures or 3,000 copies of 2nd Story and sell them via distribution without losing a lot of money. That said I know there are enough people that really want these expansions if I can reach them directly to make this at least break even, and that is what kickstarter is all about.\n\nSecondly, it is all about what we call cashflow. The time between when I pay for games (now) and when I get paid for them is upwards of 7 months, and that is in the best of circumstances. That takes a lot of money sitting in inventory, and that isn\u2019t something that we have a lot of right now.\nThirdly, I really wanted to be able to get these cool firefighter figures into your hands as quickly as possible. Kickstarter really is a great platform to do that through.\nSo I hope that you support this project and help bring these expansions to market.\nDetails on Pledge Levels \u2013 Early Bird Specials, Rush Delivery & International Delivery.\n\nFor as long as I have them I will send out copies of the firefighter figures, Urban Structures and rescue meeples right away. That means as soon as you are charged you get these sent to you right away. The sooner you pledge your support the more more likely you will be getting these early bird specials because I will go in order of pledge time.\nNote \u2013 Many of the Early Bird specials are limited to US supporters, unfortunately international postage costs are high and out of my control. I appreciate international supporters but can\u2019t control postage rates. Thanks for understanding.\n\nEssen Pick Up - Due to many complications of years past I will not be taking pre-paid Essen orders this year.

You must face your fears, never give up, and above all else work as a team because the fire is raging, the building is threatening to collapse and people are in danger.\nYou must succeed \u2013 lives are on the line!\n\nFlashPoint: Fire Rescue is a cooperative game that is fun to play with friends and family. All the players are on the same team - everyone either wins or loses together. With four levels of play (Family, Recruit, Veteran and Heroic) there is a challenge appropriate for players of all skills and ages. The game was released on Kickstarter just over a year ago. For a very brief time it was the largest board game project on the site \u2013 but now several games have raised more than 10 times what Flash Point did.\nWe are very excited about all the support we have had from the people that supported that first project, and those that played the game since. We are also very excited about all the support we have from hobby market retailers around the world, and this year really excited that Flash Point will be stocked in select Barnes & Noble and Target stores. As the market for hobby games expands it is really exciting to have a game that has captured so many people\u2019s imaginations and we hope that the 2nd edition of the game and the two expansions featured in this project will help make Flash Point a modern classic enjoyed by families around the world.\nAbout Indie Boards and Cards\n\nIndie Boards and Cards started in 2009 as an independent publisher of great game designs. In 2010 we released three games, all of which have been well received by critics and fans alike. Our biggest seller has been The Resistance - a game of secret identities, deception and deduction that is now or will soon be available in 20 languages around the world. Haggis has been a very popular card game \u2013rewarding strategic play and outstanding artwork. Triumvirate is my own design. If you like interesting card games for two player you\u2019ll want to pick this up soon as it\u2019s out of print. Be sure to look for The Resistance, Haggis and Triumvirate wherever games are sold.

We specialize in creating new and innovative music by combining various genres (classical, pop, etc) and incorporating comedy skits and choreography when we perform live.  We have had requests for an album but have not had the means to produce something of high quality thus far. Our group would like to create an album in order to share our music with a wider audience and to break the barriers between previously separate fields of music.\nWhere will all the money go?\nIn order to make this album, we first need to pay for a recording studio and engineer.  With a studio and engineer, we can have our audio professionally recorded and mixed into a highly listenable CD.  \nBecause we have so many arrangements of popular songs, we also have to pay a hefty sum to purchase copyrights to legally record our arrangements.  Each song can cost hundreds of dollars.  Some of these arrangements are our most requested and we would love to bring them to you!  (These include, but are not limited to: Lady Gaga Saga, Gotye's Somebody That I Used to Know, Fireflies by Owl City, Hide and Seek by Imogen Heap, Forget You! by Cee Lo Green, and many more!)  \nWe also will use funds for travel so we can meet up at the recording studio and make the album.\nWhy support our project?\nWe love making music and bringing entertaining pieces to you in a way that you might never have heard before.  Your donation will not only help us realize our project (to make an epic album!), but it will also go towards knocking down that line between classical and popular music.  What better way to join both genres than a bassoon quartet playing classical, popular, and original works?!\nWe can't do this project without all of you - if we fall short of our goal, we won't receive any of the pledged money (everyone gets refunds) - so thank you thank you thank you!  Please send this page along to anyone and everyone who has ever listened to, loved, or made music.  Thank you so much for your time and help!  \nLook below for more detailed information about our project.  To learn more about The BWBQ, please visit our website at:\nwww.thebreakingwinds.com\nA note on how to be a backer for this project:\nTo make a pledge to The Breaking Winds DEBUT Album, click the green \"Back This Project\" button.  You will be asked to enter your pledge amount and select a reward.  Then, you will be prompted to complete the purchase with Amazon.  If our project is successfully funded, your card will be charged when we reach the funding deadline.  Please contact us if you need help!\nMore Information and Details:\nWhy did we come to Kickstarter?\nThe album is going to be a compilation of a wide array of music, but a lot of what goes on the CD will depend on how much support we receive from YOU.  On Kickstarter, if we meet our fundraising goal, we receive every penny we raise!  The more we surpass our goal, the more songs we can do.  \nWhy is that?  For all the popular tunes, we will be recording someone else's copyrighted music.  Copyright is a really wonderful thing for musicians because it means that others cannot legally reproduce or sell their work without providing some type of compensation.  When we ask for donations, a large chunk of them will go toward other artists' copyright fees and permission to record.  If we go beyond our goal, we can record more popular songs and make a more comprehensive album.  \nAlso, the more support we get, the more studio time we can have.  When we put money towards studio time, we are not only paying to use the space, but we are also renting the recording equipment and a technician to mix the tracks. So the more money we raise, the longer we will be in the studio perfecting our performance and potentially recording extra tracks!  (Bonus features, anybody?)\nWhy do we do what we do?\nBecause we love it!  That goes without saying, but we have a number of other reasons to perform, present, and teach.  First, we feel fulfilled when we know that others are smiling, laughing, or thinking because of our performance.  Wherever we perform, we always have audience members come up to us and tell us how much they enjoyed it.  They hear some songs they know, some they don't know, and learn more about their own preferences!  We also get to raise musical awareness.  That is, we show the public that a seemingly stuffy and stodgy instrument like the bassoon can be fun, inspiring, and play more than just the Mozart Concerto.  We love all kinds of music, and introducing new textures and styles to audiences via the bassoon helps us break down the barrier between classical, popular, rock, jazz, and other genres.  With the production of this album, we hope to spread our reach and touch new audiences. \nWhat is an arrangement, and how do we write one?\nUnlike a composition, an arrangement is essentially a rewrite of a pre-existing song, but for our instrument.  If you've ever listened to something on the radio and then figured it out on piano, cello, or kazoo (or jammed with your garage band!) that's basically an arrangement.  For us, writing an arrangement begins with hearing a song that we really like and would love to play.  This can be anything!  We listen to the song over and over, paying special attention to the melody (in pop music that's usually the singer and sometimes the lead guitar) and the bass line (this is often the bass guitar and sometimes piano).  These are usually the two easiest voices to hear in a song.  Once we are familiar with them, we go to a piano or bassoon and start figuring out the pitches.  (If you want to do your own, you can use any instrument at all.  It can be a bit tricky at first, but if you keep at it, it gets easier!)  When the bass line and melody are written out, we listen to the inner voices.  These are the remaining voices that don't fit either the bass or melodic lines.  A lot of times they are guitar riffs or little fillers throughout the song.  Once those are written in, the writing process is done!  For us, the next step is clear--just grab a few friends and jam out to a brand new arrangement!  \nIf you have any other questions, comments, suggestions, please don't hesitate to write at thebreakingwinds@gmail.com.

John has pioneered a new form of inspirational and educational music through his Symphony of Science music video series, which has garnered millions of views and inspired thousands of people to pursue scientific interests;  Will Crowley is a scientifically educated multi-instrumentalist and has worked for years in the public school system as a math and science educator.  \nThe album promises to be an epic collection of songs about topics that are endlessly fascinating, yet rarely represented musically. Themes we want to cover include photosynthesis, gravity, supernovae, natural selection, and much more.  \nWe need your help to fund the creation of this album.  The money will be going to studio time, hiring additional musicians, artwork, and printing physical copies, shirts and posters. \nWe have worked together in the past creating concept albums under the name Hudson.  Please take a listen to those two albums to get a taste of what we have done previously.  We are aiming to make a series of songs that carry over the inspirational content from Symphony of Science; it will be a mix of folk/rock with some electronic thrown in.\nPlease consider supporting us in this unique endeavor.

One night as a teenager, I dreamt of a card game involving mythical crops and creatures...and a pickle!  When I awoke, I set to work creating the first, hand-drawn, version of Bulrup.  My family enjoyed the game, and I made several rounds of alterations.  Eventually, I made my first computer-illustrated deck for my friend.  His friend expressed interest in buying a copy, and the enterprise of Bulrup began!\nOver the years, I have introduced the game to friends wherever I go, and it's gotten such a great response that I decided to try selling my game.  Unfortunately, expensive self-printing options made each deck extravagantly priced, and the dream seemed to whither on the vine.\nThankfully, a fellow writer and friend took an interest in my little game and surprised me for my birthday with a professional-grade deck!  He told me the low costs he had found for custom game cards and I was hooked.  Then, he mentioned Kickstarter, and it seemed that what started with a literal dream could become a shared dream as friends and strangers around the world could invest in Bulrup.\nThis project is the creation of 100 decks of Bulrup and its first expansion pack, The Farmer's Almanac Expansion.  My goal is simply to share the joy of Bulrup with gamers and friends around the globe while raising money to produce more expansions that will change the way the game can be played.\nWill you share my dream?", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #10", "update_userinfo": "Bulrup has arrived!", "update_content": "After a very long wait, Bulrup is back from the printer and actually exists!

With our mobile apps, we've revolutionized the way people observe the night sky.  Now, we want to do for space exploration what we've done for amateur astronomy.\nThree views of SkyCube - packed for launch, deploying solar panels, and operational in orbit. CLICK HERE for a 3D version you can play with!\nWe are developing a nano-satellite, and mobile apps to go with it, as the focus for a global education and public outreach campaign.  The satellite, called SkyCube, is a 10x10x10 cm \"1U\" CubeSat intended for launch as a secondary payload on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in 2013.  Orbiting more than 300 miles up, on a path highly inclined to the Earth's equator, SkyCube will pass over most of the world's inhabited regions.\nSpaceX Falcon 9/Dragon launch from Cape Canaveral AFS, 22 May 2012\nSkyCube will take low-resolution pictures of the Earth and broadcast simple messages uploaded by sponsors.  After 90 days, it will use an 8-gram CO2 cartridge to inflate a 10-foot (3-meter) diameter balloon coated with highly reflective titanium dioxide powder.  SkyCube's balloon will make the satellite as bright as the Hubble Space Telescope or a first-magnitude star.  You'll be able to see it with your own eyes, sailing across the sky.  But SkyCube's balloon isn't just for visibility.  It will - within 3 weeks - bring SkyCube down from orbit due to atmospheric drag, ending the mission cleanly in a fiery \"grand finale\" that avoids any buildup of space debris.\nSkyCube: Your Eye in the Sky\nSkyCube won't just let you broadcast messages from space. It will also let you look back at the Earth from orbit. You can request images from the satellite using our smartphone or web app. SkyCube's images will be transmitted to our ground stations when the satellite passes over them - and then forwarded to you across the internet. You might just see your entire state (or country!) in one image from space, or catch a sunrise from orbit.  Capture hurricanes, oil spills, and other continent-wide phenomena from more than 300 miles up.  Here's what you might see:\nExact simulations of the kinds of Earth images that SkyCube can capture for you. CLICK HERE for a larger version of this montage.\nYou can even take pictures with SkyCube's cameras at night!  Here are some real pictures, taken with a real SkyCube camera, from an airplane over San Francisco at night.  A little processing greatly enhances the raw image:\nImage of San Francisco Bay Area at night, taken with a real SkyCube camera out an airplane window.\nThe International Dark-Sky Association has expressed an interest in using SkyCube to map out light pollution on the Earth's night side.  You might also use SkyCube to capture lightning, auroras, and other night-time phenomena from space.\nHow You Can Talk With SkyCube\nThe mission will utilize a 915 MHz CubeSat ground station communication network operated by the US Navy, the Boeing Corporation, and the University of Utah. During ground station passes, the satellite will transmit images to the network, which are then forwarded via internet to sponsors who have requested them from our iOS, Android, and web apps.\niOS and Android apps - shown here over a real image of NASA's NanoSail-D spacecraft - will let you track SkyCube, send messages, and request images from it.\nThe satellite will also broadcast sponsors' messages every 10 seconds as data pings - \"tweets from space\" - detectable by anyone with inexpensive amateur radio equipment.  We'll even provide such a radio to our $1000 (and higher) sponsors!  However, you won't need anything more than an internet-connected smartphone or web browser to receive messages from SkyCube.  They will be archived on our server and accessible from anywhere on the internet.\nHere are some examples of possible SkyCube \"tweets\":\n- \"Peace on Earth to All People\"\n- \"Happy Birthday Ev, April 27, 2013 - year of the SkyCube\"\n- \"Marry me, my darling THX1138!\"\n- \"Tom: call me when you get this.\"\n- \"I went to space and back - Joe Longo, April 2013\"\n- \"If you can read this, then Earth survived the Mayan doomsday of 2012.\"\nWho's Behind SkyCube\nMacTech magazine has become our first $25K corporate sponsor, providing advertising, media, and outreach services for the SkyCube mission.\nMacTech magazine - SkyCube's first corporate sponsor\nWe also welcome The Social Media Monthly, our second major sponsor, who will be providing regular updates on our progress throughout the development of the mission.\nThe Social Media Monthly\nEducation and advertising opportunities abound at all phases of the mission - you can even put your logo on the balloon!  Contact us for details.\nWe have contracted with experienced CubeSat developers Kevin Brown and Tyler Rose of Astronautical Development, LLC to build our satellite and its radio.  Kevin's CubeSat radios have a track record of 100% success, and four of them are actually operating in orbit right now.\nOur CubeSat builder, Astronautical Development.\nSkyCube's space balloon and its CO2 inflation mechanism are being built by Global Western, an experienced manufacturer of aerostats and high-altitude weather balloons.  Global Western has built multiple balloons over a million cubic feet of displacement for NASA, JPL, and other clients from Spain, France, Germany, UK, South Africa, and the USA.\nOur SkyCube balloon developer, Global Western\nOur launch provider is SpaceX - the only private company to have flown to and from the International Space Station.  We've already signed a contract with SpaceX's secondary payload integrator, Spaceflight Services, to test, manifest, and launch SkyCube in 2013.\nOur SpaceX launch integrator, Spaceflight Services\nWe ourselves will develop server infrastructure and mobile/web apps for sponsors to follow the mission.  Our plan has already won a top award at the Funders & Founders venture capital forum in San Francisco!\nSkyCube's model balloon at the San Francisco Founders & Funder's forum, May 31st, 2012. The real balloon will be 50% bigger!\nSponsorship opportunities begin at $1, and are open to anyone with a smartphone. Sponsors may follow the satellite across the sky, upload messages for it to re-broadcast, and request Earth images from the satellite, using their smartphone or browser.  Our highest-value sponsors will get a trip to Cape Canaveral to see the launch - and a chance to operate the satellite for a full day in orbit!\nScience with SkyCube\nSkyCube will provide an unprecedented opportunity for millions of sponsors worldwide to participate in a shared space exploration experience. SkyCube will be the first satellite \"owned\" by everyone. Like Sputnik did 50 years ago, SkyCube will boost interest in astronomy, space exploration, and science education for an entire new generation of explorers around the world. We hope you'll help us make it happen!\nSkyCube is - first and foremost - a mission of education and public outreach. But it also might just produce some real science. Here are some of the non-profit organizations who expressed an interested in working with SkyCube from a scientific and educational perspective:\nThe organizations with whom we're working on the education and public outreach side of SkyCube's mission.\nAstronomers Without Borders, in fact, is accepting SkyCube sponsorships on our behalf, using PayPal, for potential sponsors who might not have Amazon accounts.

Both games actually share a lot of similar game mechanics.  For those Catan players (especially my fellow gamer dads out there), I will outline some of those mechanics below:\nResource production - In Alpha Colony there are 4 resource types that you can produce, just like both Catan and M.U.L.E.  Rather than building a settlement like in Catan, you buy a plot of land and then purchase a M.U.L.E., outfit it for the resource type you want to produce, and then install it on your plot.  Certain land types produce some resources better than others, but, unlike Catan, you can change what resources based on your needs as well as the supply and demand economy.\nTrading resources - This is probably my favorite part of both Catan and M.U.L.E.  Are you a good negotiator?  Do you like trash-talking or helping out a weaker player?  You will find both the auctions and the trading ship in Alpha Colony will give you plenty of this exciting dynamic to enjoy with your friends and family.\n\n4-player family/party game - One of my favorite quotes from Danielle Bunten (the original designer of M.U.L.E.) was that No one ever said on their deathbed, 'Gee, I wish I had spent more time alone with my computer.'\"   The great thing about Alpha Colony is it is best played with your family and friends either live and in person or via asynchronous turns similar to Words with Friends.\nMerchant / port trading perk - One of my favorite aspects of Catan was both the trading ports and, in Cities and Knights, the merchant token.  This added more depth for later game play and added more strategy in building your settlements.  Although M.U.L.E. did not offer this mechanic, Alpha Colony will by having both a trading ship and racial trading perks to affect resource trading.\nRob / handicap the leader - One of my favorite aspects of M.U.L.E. was that it naturally helped the weaker player and handicapped the leader so that the stronger players were challenged but newcomers will still welcomed.  Catan does this through the use of the robber as well trading where the leader (usually me) gets ruthlessly picked on and gives them a more challenging game.  Alpha Colony will follow M.U.L.E.'s lead on this and have the random events in the game naturally help the weaker player and challenge the stronger player.  This makes Alpha Colony a perfect family game!\nBuild longest road - Anyone who has played Catan or numerous other board games understand this favorite mechanic.  Although M.U.L.E. did not offer this, Alpha Colony will give bonuses to resource production as well as other subtle game effects for the player with the most plots of land purchased and outfitted next to one another.\nM.U.L.E. - A supremely fun game with addictive strategy that combines real-time and turn-based styles as you compete for land and resources on a newly colonized planet. Have your thinking cap on on!\n\nWhat is M.U.L.E. about? - In the game, four players attempt to colonize a distant planet. They do this by using Multiple Use Labor Element to harvest food, collect energy, and mine minerals. The goal of the game is to amass the greatest wealth, but you must develop a successful colony first!\nThe big deal? - M.U.L.E. has been hailed as one of the most influential games of all time and the foundation for many game genres today. Published by Electronic Arts in 1983, It was groundbreaking when released. Will Wright dedicated his game The Sims to the memory of the designer of M.U.L.E. PCWorld notes M.U.L.E. as #5 on their list of the top 10 greatest PC games ever. A list that includes StarCraft, The Sims, Civilization, and World of Warcraft.\n\nWho created M.U.L.E.? - The game was designed by Dan* Bunten who was a game design visionary. Bunten was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Computer Game Developers Association and inducted into the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences Hall of Fame in 2007.\nIn this Kickstarter we are offering BOTH a faithful remake of the classic for mobile platforms (with an iOS or Combo pledge of $25 or more) and a modern tribute for mobile and desktop platforms.  You get to choose: play the award-winning original untouched, or play the inspired update with similarities to Settlers of Catan and Civilization!\nSee what's in store in this faithful reproduction of the original hit; this time, for the mobile platform.\nAndroid, iPad, iPhone mobile platform support\niPad 3 / iPhone 4 HD support\nSocial gaming integration, including Apple\u2019s Game Center\nFast paced and challenging game play\nThree difficulty levels\nEasy one-handed navigation\nDownloadable 8-bit skins\nVisit the M.U.L.E. Returns website for even more information, previews and discussion.\nAlpha Colony: A Tribute to M.U.L.E. is an economic video game for your iPad or desktop, similar to Sim City or Civilization. It offers an interactive experience you can share with your family and friends.  The basic game play is simple but mastering supply and demand on a remote colony is not. Deciding what to produce and when to trade it makes for a compelling experience for the whole family.\nWindows XP or newer\nMac OS X 10.5 or newer\nLinux\niPad, iPad 3, iPhone 3, iPhone 4 HD support\nAndroid\nSocial gaming integration\nFull 3D environment\nUp to four players, including cross-platform network play\nInteractive tutorial\nEight character races with unique race benefits\n4 different resources and variations of each M.U.L.E.\nBeginner, Standard and Tournament levels of play\nWith a license granted by and partnership with Dan Bunten\u2019s family as well as special access to previously unseen designs, DreamQuest Games aims to raise these funds to bring a modern update of M.U.L.E. to life.\n\"M.U.L.E. is a landmark in the history of video games worthy of a modern 3D sequel for mobile players,\" relates Christopher Williamson, Creative Director at DreamQuest Games. \nM.U.L.E. was originally developed in 1983 by Dan Bunten and his company Ozark Softscape.  It was the first major hit game published by a young upstart at the time, Electronic Arts.  The original Atari 400/800 game allowed up to four players to simultaneously select an alien race, outfit robotic workers called MULEs, and take turns producing, managing, and trading resources on the planet Irata.\n\n\"We look forward to seeing our dad's legacy continue,\" shares Melanie Bunten, the oldest of Dan Bunten's three children.\nWe wanted to make sure we raised enough to do the game right. For example, we have experimented with both a simultaneous play prototype and an asynchronous turn mode similar to Words with Friends and both were fun. Do our fans want to play this way or something more like the hot seat turn-based original?\nWe would like to see:\nmore clear race benefits (such as one race being able to move a little faster, better at catching wampus, producing food, etc.),\na more intuitive auction trading interface,\na beginner tutorial,\nand more story.\nPerhaps even an interactive single-player campaign, like we are used to seeing in hit games like Starcraft, Diablo, and Civilization.\nThis is why we wanted to go for a more aggressive fundraiser so we could really add some special AAA-level features, music, and visual polish to a game that deserves it. There have been several attempts at remaking M.U.L.E. in the past and they have always been on the cheap. I really want this game to shine and give the creator's family and the fans something as awesome as the original game was.\nDigital Edition - Our most basic pledge level still gets you a copy of the finished Alpha Colony: A Tribute to M.U.L.E. video game on the platform of your choice!\nMobile - This includes our iPad, iPhone, and Android versions.\nDesktop - This includes our PC-Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux versions.\nCombo - This includes all SIX platforms above so you can play it wherever you like!\nRetro Edition - Receive everything from the Digital level above.

You never really cared about the backers that gave you the privilege to make your film! Because if you had any sense of honor, I wouldn't have received a rushed, dirty, poorly packed, crinkled Ward print. Sure it's signed and numbered, but as a work of collectable art, it's ruined. it was packed with no plastic to protect the piece, so there are large smudges of dirt on the white paper. Perhaps I can pay to have it cleaned, but again then I'm paying for your ineptitude! Most damaging is the crease across 1/4 of the piece, which is not fixable. Maybe the work can now be \"restored,\" but I'm thinking a dart board is a better use of the physical representation of your farce. The monkeys you hired to handle this job obviously had no oversite, or any experience packing art, because I've received McDonald's dollar menu burgers packed with better care.

The application allows you to play pen & paper roleplaying games as well as strategy/board games online with other players from around the world. \nWith a host of useful features, we hope to support as many game types as possible:\nRobust dice rolling\nBattle maps with grid overlays\nTokens with editable fields\nMacros for storing frequently used commands\nCustom tables so you can roll from user created lists or card decks\nThese features, combined with the integrated video conferencing already included in Google+ Hangouts, provides what we feel is an experience that closely matches face-to-face tabletop gaming.\nWhy are you doing a Kickstarter?\n\nTabletop Forge started as a hobby project. While it is perfectly usable in its current form, we want to take it to a professional level. The primary use of the Kickstarter funds will be to purchase art assets to use directly in the application. Instead of hunting for an encounter map for that surprise tavern fight, we want you to be able to just choose a tavern map you like and load it directly in the app. We want tokens for all the generic fantasy creatures (like goblins), as well as modern/sci-fi tokens like guards and ships.\n\nBesides empowering players, we believe in supporting indie artists, writers and game designers. A large chunk of our KickStarter money will go back into the community, to people like Jonathan Roberts and Devin Night, so we can secure the rights to use their creations in Tabletop Forge.\n\nWe will also bring more programmers and designers on board to polish the features and user experience of Tabletop Forge and make sure it works smoothly and intuitively. Again, wherever possible we will hire from within, finding artists, designers, and programmers from within the RPG community.  \nSo what do I get for supporting Tabletop Forge?\nWe have a ton of excellent Kickstarter rewards including some fun maps, tokens, and other assets that will be available to backers only. If we hit our goal, we have plans to bring in new content like maps, tokens, and more as stretch goals.\nAfter months of adventuring you have reached the fabled Tabletop Forge and slain the blacksmiths who guarded it. As your reward, you may now take one item from their enchanted armory.\nWhy Tabletop Forge versus other virtual tabletops?\n\nWe admit there are other cool virtual tabletops out there but the primary reason we started developing Tabletop Forge was because of the awesome RPG community that exists on Google+. Even before the first line of code was written for our app, there were a steady stream of people playing pickup games on Google+ Hangouts using separate dice rollers. We wanted to give those gamers a tool so they could have the whole package in one place and solve the issues they were having. Now instead of seeing a handful of games a week we are seeing dozens, and that number is continuing to grow.\n\nThe main advantage of an online virtual tabletop is that it allows for games to be started quickly with no installation and port forwarding necessary. We also feel that our feature set matches up to some of the other popular virtual tabletops and we are improving the application daily.\n\nWe also have a lot of support from indie game designers evidenced by all the cool Kickstarer rewards they are offering. Our goal is to enable a wide range of gaming styles, and not tie Tabletop Forge to one specific system.\nFor example, although we have great map features (and more on the way), we do not want the app to revolve solely around gridded maps. We want to support features common to indie games like atmosphere, index cards, token/chit mechanics, and more.\nWe already have commitments that once we have an in-game store up and running, you will be able to purchase games, adventures, maps, tokens, and more from the game designers and artists for use directly in the app.\n\nNo matter what, Tabletop Forge itself is going to remain free because this is a product we feel that the community deserves and we want to encourage new gamers in the hobby.\nStretch Goals\nStretch Goal #1\nStretch Goal #2\nStretch Goal #3\nStretch Goal #4\nFinal Stretch Goal\nThe first part of this stretch goal is going to be a complete fantasy setting for use with Tabletop Forge along with 4 adventures. The fine folks at White Haired Man they are taking their system neutral setting Kith\u2019takharos and packaging it in a PDF for reference directly in the app. They are also taking 4 adventures (previously design for both 3.5 and Savage Worlds) and providing these for everyone who uses Tabletop Forge. As I have personally playtested a couple of these adventures I think they will be a great addition to our line up of great assets.\n\nThe second part of the stretch goal is going to be 20 issues of Toys for the Sandbox by Occult Moon. Toys for the Sandbox is an ongoing series providing system agnostic story hooks, locations, and NPCs in a framework designed to help a GM insert them easily into any game system. We will be getting a mix of fantasy and sci-fi issues and they will be available directly in the application for everyone.\nThe last part of this stretch goal is something we are personally excited about and if it happens will be bringing aboard a new member to the Tabletop Forge team. If we can hit this final stretch goal we will be including 3D dice that you can roll with the mouse complete with a physics engine. We think web technology is far enough along that we can attempt this and that this feature will help the application feel more like playing at a real tabletop. This kind of feature has been relegated to the desktop space in other virtual tabletops and we hope to bring it to the masses online.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comments": [{"username": "Andrew LaFrance", "content": "Was the breaking of forstar nagar ever released?

We\u2019ve spent $42,500 on development so far and just need another $20,000 to see us through to completion. Mob Rules Games believes transparent business practices are vital to earning your trust, and will make our budget, expenses, sales, and schedule publicly available. Every $5 pledged earns you additional copies of the game, which you can give away or sell as you please. We plan to release Haunts: The Manse Macabre in time for Halloween this year.\n FUNDED! Now We Stretch!\nThanks to the 1000 or so generous donors, we have done it. Now, we can try for even more. We had a survey of supporters a few weeks ago, asking which monsters we should add to the game. You all picked some great winners, but there were plenty of popular runners up. We thought we'd see if you wanted to put them in the game too.\nFor Every $1000 we raise over the $25,000 original ask, we'll add in another of these Denizens. Since we're already over $26k, the obvious first Bonus Denizen is the exactly tied Ancient Ones. The rest will come online in the following order:\n\n$27,000 Unlocks The Runner-Up Evil Genius\n\n$28,000 Unlocks the Runner-Up Vampire\n\n$29,000 Unlocks the Runner-Up Psychopath\n\n$30,000 Unlocks the Alternate Creepy Child\n\n$31,000 We'll look at other Abominations and see what people like.\n$26,000 - Already Unlocked! Both Ancient Ones\n$27,000 Unlock: Evil Genius\n$28,000 Unlock: Vampire\n$29,000 Unlock: Psychopath\n$30,000 Unlock: Creepy Child\nThe Game\nHaunts: The Manse Macabre is a turn-based game for PC/Mac/Linux that allows players to take control of either the haunting denizens that have earned this infamous home its dire reputation or as the intrepid intruders determined to pry loose the Tyree Manse\u2019s dread secrets. It can be played versus another player or versus the AI, online or all alone. A lengthy single-player campaign tells the house\u2019s horrifying history and unlocks new denizens and intruders to use in the game. Scores of maps combined with variable goals, customizable rosters, and a variety of opponents offer endlessly unique and re-playable games. \nEach side begins the game by choosing their forces in secret, so that their opponent has no idea what kind of units and abilities they\u2019ll face. The Intruders recruit a squad of three people, each of which can have different equipment and special abilities. There are weapons, psychic or magic powers, special scientific gear, ancient relics, and so on. They also secretly pick what kind of goal they\u2019re trying to achieve by searching the Tyree Manse. The Intruders could be trying to recover an artifact or dark tome, cleanse the house of its evil spirits, or solve one of the house\u2019s many mysteries. \nThe Denizens will have to defend against any of the goals the Intruders might be after, but the haunters have plenty of surprises of their own. They get to choose the nature of the haunting. Phantasms, Cultists, Abominations, Undying, Psychopaths: each comes with its own set of leaders, servitors, and minions. Creatures range from powerful monsters that can tear a foolhardy explorer to pieces, to small orbs that can spy on the intruders. Each leader has unique powers used to plague the Intruders, which range from temporary pools of darkness, to poltergeist attacks that damage and disorient, to reality warping changes to the house itself. \nPlayers have no idea what their opponent is doing, until they discover it for themselves during the game. Light and darkness have crucial roles in determining how the game plays out, since it\u2019s always in your best interest to hide your movements from your foe even as you try to suss out what they\u2019re up to. With its mercurial maps, hidden agendas, and stealthy maneuvers punctuated by macabre attacks, Haunts: The Manse Macabre builds tension like a great ghost story should. Whether or not it has a happy ending depends, of course, on your point of view. \nEvery $5 Buys You Another Copy of the Game\nFor every $5 you give to support Haunts: The Manse Macabre, you will receive a code good for downloading one copy of the game. You can (and are encouraged to) give away the extra codes to friends, to sell them to strangers, or print them out and frame them as a testament to your generosity and fine taste. \nSo, for example, if you donate $25, you\u2019ll not only get a copy of the game for yourself, but four other copies. That\u2019s one for your best friend as a Halloween present, one for that special someone you\u2019re trying to woo with promises of digital horror, and two that you can sell to other gamers who\u2019re just looking for a good time.\nWe consider each $5 a pre-sale of the game. We might well ending up actually selling it for a few bucks more than that, but we\u2019re happy as hell to book the sales now. What happens to those copies of the game afterwards is up to you - they\u2019re yours.\nWhy We Need the Money\nHaunts: The Manse Macabre has been under development since December, 2011, when we let everyone who registered on our site vote to decide which game we would make. Haunts was the winner, and we\u2019ve been working hard on it ever since. The Lewis Charitable Foundation invested in the initial development. Spread out over three milestones - all of which we have met - the investment totalled $42,500. We\u2019re still using that money to pay salaries for two of our three developers, along with other basic business costs like licensing software and promotion. We need another $20,000 to finish the game and make sure it\u2019s as good we can make it. We're asking for $5000 more than what we need in order to cover the cut Amazon and Kickstarter take as well as promotional costs.\nMob Rules Games believes that radical transparency is the best way for us to do business - that if we are as open and straightforward as possible with our customers and the world, we\u2019ll both earn their trust and be able to operate in an open and honest manner. We post our budget, schedule, progress, investors, and corporate policies on our web site. We will tell you exactly how much money we\u2019ve spent and how we use every dollar that comes in through this Kickstarter. Once the game is released, we will tell you exactly how many we\u2019ve sold, how much money we\u2019ve made, and so on. \nAnd you don\u2019t just have to take our word for it. Thus far all of our operating capital has come from investments by the Lewis Charitable Foundation, a non-profit with the goal of promoting radical transparency in business. We\u2019re already accountable to them, but we want to be accountable to you as well. For those who want to know more about our open business model, check out mobrulesgames.com. There we have details about the budget and schedule, an explanation of our rather unusual, project-based investment model, and a description of our worker-controlled corporate structure.\nWhy We Need Your Voice\nMob Rules Games is just three full time developers plus a few talented part-time contractors. We have a vision and a plan and we\u2019re working hard, but we want input from our customers and players too. Our first vote chose our game, and we think that worked out really well. With limited time and resources, there are other decisions to make as well. Which denizens should we include? Which intruders? What other features does the game need? Is it any fun? We want to put these questions to you, the supporters. So before or after you\u2019ve pledged support, we hope you\u2019ll come over to mobrulesgames.com, register with us, and make your voice heard.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #31", "update_userinfo": "Problems Persist", "update_content": "Things are not going well.

I am still determined to get the game out, but I no longer have any way of knowing when and how that will happen.\nThe principal cause for our dire condition is that there are no longer any programmers working on the game. Our lead programmer, Jonathan, was always going to move on to something else after a year or so. We had hoped that he would be able to work on the game in his spare time, but now that he\u2019s going back at Google, he has told us that his spare time will be very minimal and not enough to make progress on the game. Our second programmer, Josh, has quit the project entirely to take another job. He does not want to work on the game in his spare time."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #24", "update_userinfo": "Single Player Clarifications and New Announcement", "update_content": "I did not explain things very well yesterday. Let me clarify the current single player plan before I then announce something new and exciting.\n\nWhat we\u2019re not going to do, and what I was referencing yesterday when I mentioned the single player campaign being pretty much dead, is the massive, inter-woven single-player story we\u2019d been working on where every chapter was connected to every other in decisions you made. It was way too unwieldy and poorly paced, in addition to being overly complicated and seemingly impossible to execute and balance.\n\nWhat we are doing (and what I failed to explain well yesterday) is a series of individual levels that tell the overall story of the house and are discrete from one another. Each level tells a story inspired by an era and a horror movie from that era, and together they tell the story of the house. There are lots of characters in each story, and that is where the cameos will come in. Indeed, since these levels are meant to be replayed against opponents, the cameos will probably get much more screen time with each player than under the old, multi-level spanning story mode.\n\nThe other big change is that, unlike what we were doing before where the levels were serving a giant, Rube Goldberg Machine plot and suffering for it, each level is designed to be a compelling multiplayer map that plays differently depend on if you\u2019re the Denizens or the Intruders. Each level has some unique mechanic or set-up that matches the story and setting. For example, level four is about the vampire denizen, and centers around the Intruders with limited sight range placing lights that weaken the denizens and the denizens moving very fast in the dark around them. These are not simply multiplayer deathmatch arenas with no plot behind them. The plot came first and we came up with mechanics that were a fun match.\n\nEach of these levels will have an AI you can play against as you go through them, for either side. What I was clumsily alluding to yesterday is that the AI will probably not be very competitive after the first couple times you play a level and know some basic strategy for it. So they are rich in theme but designed to be rewarding to replay, especially against a living (or intelligently undead) opponent.\n\nI hope that clears up a lot of the very valid concerns supporters expressed yesterday. But there is more! We heard you and we are not giving up on expanding on more story-focused single player levels.The game I described above will release to Kickstarter supporters as soon as its ready - by Halloween is the plan.\n\nWork on Haunts will not cease with that release! We will press forward with more story-centric, single-player content. Monday\u2019s announcement and the wave of feedback we received got me thinking long and hard and looking for ways to take your advice and keep trying to work on compelling, story-centric content into the game. At the same time, I was still trying to figure out what to do about another lingering problem I hadn\u2019t told you about, because it was part of a future expansion project we haven't announced yet.\n\nIt has long been the plan to make a follow-up, extra content release for Haunts that consisted of single-player stories with plots written by some of the coolest horror writers going right now. Originally we were going to sell this separately, as a follow up DLC pack, but now we are going to roll all of that content into the core game. This solves two problems - it gives us a great base to build single-player, story-driven levels around and it allows me to keep working with these great writers and figure out the best way to execute their creepy creations in Haunts.\n\nOver the coming months, we\u2019ll work with those writers and the community to find the horrific fun in these single-player stories. All of those updates will be part of the Kickstarter Supporters edition of the game. When we\u2019ve got them ready, we\u2019ll push the content out to you.\n\nEventually, we will do a full retail release of the game, which will have all the content you supporters get, but for a higher price. Additionally, we\u2019ll release some bonus content for the Kickstarter editions only, either new story or multiplayer maps - maybe one of each, we\u2019ll see.\n\nSo, meet some of The Writers -"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #23", "update_userinfo": "More on Single Player", "update_content": "Right, so, I totally hear you folks who are disappointed about the single player campaign not coming together.\nI will refund the pledges of anyone who feels cheated, absolutely. \nLet me explain a little more.

Just bid $5 more than the selected reward level, and send me a PM that says \"STEMS PLEASE\"\n******\nIn recent years several great records have been created by putting electronic twists on classic recordings (e.g. Kind of Bloop & Dub Side of the Moon).  That got me thinking - what if we did the opposite?: take widely-known modern electronic music hits and recreate them with an ensemble that could have existed 100 years ago.\nDaft Punk seemed an obvious choice - their music is great, it's accessible and widely known, and it's super danceable. What better way to reformat their tunes than the irresistable funky goodness of a New Orleans brass band?\nI plan to arrange Daft Punk's 4 biggest hits for brass band.  I've already written the arrangement for Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger.  The other 3 tunes I'll be doing are: One More Time, Around the World, and Da Funk.\nOnce I have the arrangements, I'll hire select musicians from several favorite N.O. bands and bring them into the studio to record.  From there I'll edit, mix, and send it off to be mastered.  In the end, it will be available as a download and as a vinyl record.\nWhat the money is for: There are several major expenses here:  hiring musicians for the recording sessions, licensing fees to the folks that own the original songs and legal fees for having a lawyer obtain those licenses, paying for the album graphics, mastering, vinyl manufacturing, and a handful of other miscellany.  It adds up.\nExtended Goals:\n$14,000 - if we his this mark I'll hire photographer Donovan Fannon to come shoot the sessions, post tons of the photos on line for you all to see, print an assortment of 5x7s, and include one print with each copy vinyl record that goes out to backers.  Also, I'll make all backer vinyl records a limited signed & numbered edition.  Only backers will receive the signed & numbered versions, the edition quantity limited by the # of records issued as backer rewards.\n$16,000 - if backing gets this high, I'll do the same as above, but upgrade the  prints included w/ the records to 8x10 instead of 5x7.\nLinks:\nPHONEFT example\nElectronola - my first kickstarter project\n\n\nThis is a tribute record.

We were in the region of $125k two days ago, and we were wondering whether we'd hit the Soviet Town or not - but we've got that and gone another $10k further (and we're still going)! You guys have been fantastic.\nEDIT 9 - We've hit the Soviet Town tileset at $140,000 with 13 hours left to go! To make the last few hours more exciting, we've tweaked the stretch goals again - tileset-specific AI soldiers have been moved to $150,000 (300% funding and a nice round number!)\n$75,000 - Dedicated level designer! - ACHIEVED!\n$100,000 - Indoor missions! - ACHIEVED!\n$140,000 - Soviet Town terror mission tileset! - ACHIEVED!\n$150,000 - Tileset-specific friendly AI soldiers! - ACHIEVED!\n$190,000 - Military Base terror mission tileset!\n$215,000 - Motion detector!\nThe remaining stretch goals can be seen with the other historical edits at the bottom of the page!\n1 October, 1979: Unidentified forces arrive in Earth orbit, presumed of extraterrestrial origin. Panic spreads globally when attempts at communication fail, and efforts to repel invaders scouting the upper atmosphere are met with heavy losses and little success.\nOnly a single successful interception occurs, conducted by modified aircraft that appear at least partially resistant to the extraterrestrial weaponry. Following this victory, a clandestine organisation known only as the \u2018Xenonauts\u2019 establishes communication with the major world powers and claims responsibility, demanding both funding and authority to operate within their territory and airspace in exchange for protection.\n\nFor humanity, a glimmer of hope remains \u2013 if they can withstand the attacks long enough unravel the secrets of the alien aggressors, the Xenonauts may find yet a way to defeat the alien invasion. Should they fail, millions of years of human history will be brought to a close in mere months\u2026\nStrategic Map: Take command of Earth's defense on the strategic map, building and managing bases across the globe. Deploy your interceptor aircraft to track and engage the alien craft as they appear, and research captured alien artifacts to unlock new battlefield technology and reveal the secrets of the alien menace!\nThe strategic level of the game contains the high-level management of the game, controlling the finances of the organisation and balancing expanding your defences to new areas against protecting the areas you already cover. This is where you build or hire and equip your aircraft, vehicles and soldiers used in the other parts of the game.\nAerial Combat: Battle alien craft in fast paced pausable real-time air combat, with squadrons of up to three combatants on each side. With numerous different interceptors and over a dozen alien UFO types to battle, the air combat is a major addition to the old X-Com formula! \nThe air combat is triggered when human aircraft and alien UFOs meet on the strategic map. Each aircraft is individually controllable and carries the equipment issued to it on the strategic level. If destroyed in combat, it is lost forever - so be careful!\nGround Combat: Control Xenonaut strike teams on ground missions in old-school turn-based combat! Arm your soldiers with a variety of weapons and tackle numerous types of aliens on the battlefield, each with unique abilities and posing a different challenge. Your troops are persistent and level up with time, assuming they live that long - the aliens are dangerous enemies and casualties are frequent!\nEach mission is dynamically generated (based on the events of the strategic map), with fully-destructible battlefields generated in a semi-random layout. There are various types of mission, from recovering the crashed UFOs shot down in the air combat to clearing out alien terror sites. You might also find yourself attacking an alien base, or desperately defending your own against alien attack.\nSuccess in a mission allows the player to recover the corpses of the alien units and their equipment, as well as any surviving UFO components. These unlock new research projects on the strategic layer of the game, allowing the player to build new weapons and equipment to use on the battlefield!\nAll this probably sounds familiar to some readers \u2013 Xenonauts is a spiritual successor to the classic X-Com strategy games. We are aiming to take the original mechanics and update them for the modern age, making them easier to use and more in-depth without changing the fundamentals. All the classic features are present and accounted for \u2013 things like turn-based combat, destructible environments, soldier permadeath and large squad sizes (you\u2019ll need them)!\nDon't just take our word for it, though - you can download our latest development build at the link below and make your mind up for yourself:\nDownload Link (Courtesy of a kind KS backer!)\nDownload Link #2 (Courtesy of AtomicGamer!)\nDownload Torrent (please seed once downloaded!)\nThere's still plenty of work to do done on the game, a lot to do with the interface and usability, but we hope it is advanced enough for you to see what we are shooting for for the final game!\n Xenonauts has been in development for almost three years already, and has been available for pre-order for the last 18 months (please see the FAQ if you have already pre-ordered the game). We are planning to release the game this year. Why are we doing a Kickstarter?\nThe answer is simple - we want to make Xenonauts as good as it can be! We have raised enough money through our existing pre-order system to finish the game, but there are a lot of cool little touches that we want to implement but we simply don't have the resources to justify spending our time on. This is a shame - it's always the little touches that make a game memorable!\nXenonauts is also an incredibly complex game and contains vast amounts of content. We only have three full-time team members (the project lead, one artist and one coder) and they don't even live in the same country, instead working together in a virtual office. Everyone else on the team works with us part-time, around other jobs - the ones that pay the bills. This causes a lot of delays, bottlenecks, miscommunication and stress. \nDespite the difficulties, we are nearing completion of the game using this model. However, getting the key team members together full time and in the same place would allow us to respond to bugs and issues more quickly, and finish the game faster and to a higher standard (and with less damage to our collective sanity).\nThe key message is this: if the Kickstarter fails, Xenonauts will still be released and will be a good game. If the Kickstarter succeeds, the game will be better and finished more quickly because of it.\nThere's plenty in it for you too - as well as ensuring you end up with a great game at the end of development, we're offering a whole bunch of rewards to people who pledge to support Xenonauts (check the FAQ for full details for each one)!\nA digital copy of Xenonauts on release, with full access to the development builds and beta in the meantime.\nPre-Order forum medals for the official Xenonauts forums!\nDesktop wallpapers for your computer!\nA full-size A3 Xenonauts wall poster!\nA limited-edition black Xenonauts T-shirt!\nThe Xenonauts Art Book, a full-colour 48-page book featuring selected artwork taken from the project and the stories behind them!\nThe chance for in-game soldiers to spawn with your name, nationality and even your face!\nSpecial thanks in the game intro / outro credits!\nFull details on these rewards are available in the FAQ section below.\nSo, you're excited by the game and excited by the rewards you can get for donating - what exactly is it that we want to spend the money on?\nIt's difficult to say exactly what additional features would end up in the final game, because sometimes new features don't work very well and have to be removed again. But these are some of the ideas we'd like to explore:\nNew UI\nAnimated battlefield tiles\nHigh quality research-screen art\nCombat suppression mechanics\nSoldier medal system\nBattlefield motion detector\nUI art updating to reflect game progress\nIntro / Outro movie (in the monochrome painted style of the Homeworld cutscenes)\nEncouragement for modders (eg. our Soviet Weapons pack)\nHowever, the most important benefit is unlikely to be directly visible in the final product - having the team working together much more closely. The more money we can raise, the more we can move towards a traditional studio setup.\nWorking remotely with part-time team members didn't pose too many difficulties when everyone was working on separate elements of the game, but as we've started tying things together bugs and features frequently overlap across several different areas. This makes it essentially impossible to work to any meaningful deadlines.\nHaving access to more money won't magically make all of our problems disappear, but it will fix a lot of them. It will let us experiment with the cool ideas listed above (amongst others) and should allow us to have a much smoother beta phase and game launch, resulting in you getting a more polished product with fewer delays.\nThe support the community has given this project up to this point has been fantastic, so a big thankyou goes out to anyone who has already pre-ordered the game or helped out along the way.\nWe would be incredibly grateful for the chance to make Xenonauts as good as it can be, as it has been a labour of love for everyone on the team for the past three years and we've love for it to deliver on the vast promise it has!\nHISTORICAL EDITS:\nEDIT 8 - 24 hours left to go! There's been a bit of a surge of interest in the project in the last day or two and we're in reach of our $140,000 stretch goal (Soviet Town tileset). This is great, as it's something we weren't confident we'd hit earlier in the week! Huge thanks for the support, let's see how high we can push things in the final day!\nEDIT 6 - I have done a Reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything) for the next few hours, if anyone wants to chip in with questions!\nEDIT 5 - Wow! We've got into six figures now (and achieved our Indoor Missions stretch goal)! You can also see a preview of the female soldiers and read about what we've been working on in Update 7!\nEDIT 4 - We've added boxed DVD copies and second digital copies (to give to a friend) at the $50 mark, and anyone who has already pledged at $50 can choose those as rewards too. See Update 6 for full details (includes a free preview of our Art Book)!\nEDIT 3 - Stretch goals have been announced as a result of YOUR voting! See Update 5 for a full list of what will be going in the game, and when! Here's the truncated list:\n$75,000 - Dedicated level designer! - ACHIEVED!\n$100,000 - Indoor missions! - ACHIEVED!\n$140,000 - Soviet Town terror mission tileset!\n$180,000 - Military Base terror mission tileset!\n$205,000 - Tileset-specific friendly AI soldiers!\n$230,000 - Motion detector!\n$255,000 - Soldier Memorial screen!\n$280,000 - Vehicle combat experience!\n$305,000 - Pilot portraits & callsigns!\n$330,000 - Proximity grenades!\n$355,000 - Tall grass!\n$380,000 - Human psionics and blaster bombs mod!\nEDIT 2 - A list of exactly what is going in the game as a result of the money already pledged can be found here, in Update 4!\nEDIT 1 - WOW! Fully funded in just over two days! Thanks guys, you are incredible.

The result: Beer Battle! Check it out:\n\nDo that on your desktop, laptop, or tablet! Thanks to all of our friends and backers!\n_________________________________________\nPlaysurface\nWe have a new mechanical and electronic design approach to bring large-format touch computing and home touch tables within reach of ordinary developers and consumers. Our development of Playsurface started by assembling the best open-source optical touch table plans available, and we intend to create a hackable, multi-use, blazingly fast touch computing platform for gaming, music, browsing, device control, and other applications. The goal is to enable cutting-edge performance at a price point that makes buying a touch table similar to many consumer home computer purchases.\nFeatures\nPlaysurface addresses touch table design from both mechanical and electronic design trajectories, and includes:\nA new, application-specific closed-loop digital image processing module to provide touch detection and tracking functions apart from the gaming/application computer\nAn open-hardware cabinet and surface design developed for cost optimization and flat-pack shipping\nA USB interface standard and driver that reduces implementation of the touch table to the same level as plugging in monitor and mouse peripherals\nOnce the development work is done, we will ship you a complete touch table and all of the open-source driver and demo programs needed to get you going right away. With Playsurface, if you can put together Ikea furniture and plug in a new monitor, you can have an incredible touch table.\nWhere We Are\nTempleman Automation (TA) is a contract engineering company with prior sales of inexpensive touch tables in the educational and research sector. This has involved significant work on hardware and software. \nHowever, to make a really great multi-purpose touch computer two critical pieces are still missing and need Kickstarter support:\nThe touch interface must perform the optical touch tracking without taxing the application processor and with minimum system requirements\nA specialized hardware design is required to match the new electronics architecture and meet all materials, shipping, and home-assembly requirements\nTA has a design to address these issues and wants to make the resulting touch table available to the world as an open-source hardware and software project!\nWhy We Need Funding\nTouch computing has innumerable commercial opportunities. We meet people every day with skills and ideas that should be applied to touch tables.  We are using Kickstarter to generate the start-up funding necessary to create a finished platform to drive application creation. Our Playsurface Kickstarter rewards have low overhead to maintain our low-cost vision, and we hope to sell units commercially after the Kickstarter. \nBut we need both initial orders and funding for tooling costs to create the next generation of touch tables!  \nThanks for any and all help Kickstarters!\nHere is a new movie to show some of the things you can do with Playsurface right out of the box with Windows 7:\nHere is another short movie about playing games on Playsurface:\nHere is another one by popular request showing Playsurface with a few of the Microsoft Touch Pack applications - designed by Microsoft to show off the multitouch capabilities of Windows 7:\nIn response to questions about fiducial tracking with the Playsurface, here is a new video showing two applications we have made:\nHere is another movie showing Playsurface running MapTool to spice up board and roll playing gaming!\nHere is another one showing music editing with a virtual mixer and digital recording system:\nWe have had such a great response from the RPG crowd, we thought we would show a few more tools that work great with Playsurface.

Today. Thanks for your support!\nFor a long, long time, goblins and fairies have lived in a magical world right beneath our noses. If you look hard enough, you can find rings of mushrooms, called \u201cfairy rings\u201d, which act as doors between their world and ours. Today, a gang of mischievous goblins escaped from the fairy ring, and it is up to the players to send them back before they cause trouble! But an ancient spell of rhymes which transforms goblins into fairies and fairies into goblins makes this a trickier task than you might think\u2026\nGoblins Drool, Fairies Rule! is for 2 to 4 players, and has special solitaire rules for a single player. The game takes about 15 minutes to setup and play. The components consist of 20 unique cards, each card having one side representing a Goblin, and another side representing a Fairy. Each side of a card has one of 4 Symbols: a Sun, a Moon, a Mushroom, or a Frog. The names of the Fairies and Goblins are divided into 5 rhyming groups, each name ending in one of five sounds.\nPlayers begin the game with 4 cards each, goblin-side-up. 4 cards are placed fairy-side-up in the middle of the table, called the \"Fairy Ring\". The goal of the game is to be the first player to get rid of all their Goblins by sending them to the Fairy Ring, or be the first to obtain 6 Fairies. Players take turns adding one of their cards to the Fairy Ring. When a card is added, any other cards in the Fairy Ring which rhyme with the name on the added card are flipped over: Fairies become Goblins and Goblins become Fairies. Once all rhyming cards have been flipped over, the player then takes any cards from the Fairy Ring which match the symbol on the added card. The first player to end their turn with no more Goblins, or with 6 Fairies, wins the game.\nThe game was designed by David Luis Sanhueza, with illustrations by Mike Maihack.

See the FAQ at the end.\nHow Bluff Works Was Inspired\nAfter my son was born, I went through a major re-shuffling of my priorities. One of the things nagging at me was how much time and energy I was spending maintaining my work clothes. Never mind all the ironing, even just washing my pants after each wear felt excessive and completely out of whack with what I really cared about and wanted to be doing with my time.\nWhen I considered all the water, energy, and detergent consumed with every wash, I felt even worse. And the times I didn't have anything to wear in the morning drove me crazy.\nThe Solution\nWhat I came up with was a new pair of pants inspired by the travel clothes I wore overseas. The challenge was to make them look less goofy.\nMy Bluffs are designed to look great in the office, but stand up to being rolled, folded, stuffed in a bag, and most importantly worn time and time again without ironing or washing in between. Because they are cool and light, they are comfortable when you're on a bike, or jammed into a hot subway train. A built-in mobility gusset accommodates a wide range of activity. They are dying to be the one pair of pants you take when you travel!\nA handful of wear testers have been hammering these pants for a year - consistently wearing them 5 to 10 times or more without washing or ironing. You may not go to the same extremes we have... but there's no doubt you can benefit from a few extra days of use... far more than any of your normal khakis. My Kickstarter video is a true representation of what the pants can do.\nTheir Size and Makeup\nThe pants are made from 100% polyester - like a lot of the performance apparel designed for sports and outdoor activities. They achieve their wrinkle resistance from the way the polyester is woven, and have a stain-release treatment applied.\nThis is a better color representation:\nNew Black Color\nThey come in the three colors you see above - plus Dark Dark Grey that was added during the project - and every waist size from 28\" to 42\", including the odd 29, 31, 33 sizes in-between. Inseams offered are 28\", 30\", 32\", 34\", 36\", or an extra extra long unhemmed version yet to be determined. (See: http://www.facebook.com/BluffWorks for discussion of how long it should be).\nMachine wash cold. Line or tumble dry. No iron needed. For best results tumble dry on warm for a few minutes. Wash them in the sink if you're on the road.\nHere's a sneak peek at the inside pocketing:\nHow They Are Made\nThe fabric is manufactured in Taiwan and dyed under an Oeko-Tex Standard 100 product class II certificate, which independently validates that no harmful chemicals were used in the dying process.\nThe pants are designed and sewn in NYC.\nHow I Did It\nRather than marching off and learning to sew, I hired the right experts. So far, I've been at this project since May 2010. I started with classes at NYC's Fashion Institute of Technology for industry background and a specific focus on fashion entrepreneurship. I then spent a year searching for fabric, and the next 6+ months refining the fit and working on the commercial aspects of launching a new product and brand.\nMy Team Includes:\nAn Apparel Consultant who has run textile departments, as well as the operational side of complete couture lines.\nTwo Pattern Makers, who also work on men's pant lines for national brands.\nA Fit Model whose full-time job is to give pattern and fit feedback to many of the largest well-known brands.\nSandstrom Partners in Portland, Oregon, who is helping me distinguish and express the identity of my brand.\nLegal and Financial Consultants providing advice particular to trademark issues and development of a startup.\nA panel of Wear Testers, including friends and some acquaintances who gave me an honest opinion. I also conducted a trial fitting on a larger sample to make sure my sizes were true to form.\nA Sound Engineer for my Kickstarter video.\nSustainability\nPolyester offers a surprising potential for sustainability, as a result of three factors: its long life, its potential for recycling and a reduction in the amount of resources used for its care.\nIn terms of garment life, my pants appear to be on track, with no fading, degradation or fraying after the first year of wear.\nIn terms of recyclability, I am working on making use of recycled polyester in my fabric. How quickly I can achieve this depends partly on how popular the pants become. Regardless, I will accept every discarded garment for use in future recycling.\nIn terms of reduction in care, I wash my pants far less than a normal pair of khakis, and my guess is that others will too.\nWhen I've reached a large enough scale, I intend to create a closed-loop recycling system that makes new garments out of old ones.\nWhat's Included in the Rewards\nI am offering pants as a reward on Kickstarter discounted from the $85 they will cost at retail. Shipping is included. If you live outside the US, please add $10 for shipping 1-2 pairs, $15 for 3 pairs.\nI'll accept an exchange to get the size right and will pay for the shipping back to you.\nMultiple pairs must be shipped to a single address, but can be in any combination of color and size you choose.\nThe Bluff Rescue Box is designed to provide long-distance help to someone you love. The box will include a special card explaining how it works. There's no reason it can't be a surprise! Just make sure you get accurate size information so your guy will likely fit into one of the two sizes. I'll still do an exchange, as needed.\nCarte Bluff starts with three pairs of pants and a water bottle. After that, you'll have rights to order one item (single color/size) of everything I make for the next FIVE years. It includes shipping and exchanges, as required. Hopefully, this will be a lot of product!\nLastly, to purchase the water bottle with any other reward level, just add $20 to your pledge.\nHere's a concept (unapproved mockup) of the water bottle:\nPreparing for Production\nHere's where I stand in terms of getting ready for production:\nMain Fabric: sitting at the factory, ready to go.\nPattern: done and graded for all sizes.\nZippers: I have identified the brand, but still need to choose the colors and order them.\nPocketing: working on sourcing the pocketing material now. \nButtons: the design is complete and a prototype is on the way.\nDuring the Kickstarter campaign, I'll be providing detailed updates on my progress.\nI've had extensive meetings with the factory in order to plan for production. They made my samples, and are familiar with the fabric and pattern, and are currently warehousing my raw materials.\nYour Support\nYour support will fund the initial order of 500 pairs - made in NYC - and will help bring my pants and the Bluff Works brand to life!\nWhat I'm Trying to Start\nMy goal is for these pants to launch an entire company dedicated to solving apparel problems.\nThis is why I created Bluff Works: to make a better pair of men's pants that sustain the passionate, busy, active lives that you and I lead. And, ironically to put pants back where they belong - as something we use in our lives, but aren't such a time-suck. I don't know you personally, but I suspect you have big dreams and better things to do than take care of your pants... I hope my Bluffs can help. \nLastly, here's a video from the unforgettable night I launched:\nTHANK YOU for your support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #34", "update_userinfo": "Monday, Dress Shirt Goes Live!", "update_content": "Gents,\nPer our deal, I wanted to let you know that Monday September 18th at 11AM ET we're launching a dress shirt here, on Kickstarter.\nTo know the second it goes, follow me using Kickstarter's follow feature at:\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/profile/594084262"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "The Blazer Launches Today at 10AM", "update_content": "Dearest Original Kickstarter Guys,\nWe have been burning the midnight oil to launch what many of you asked for years ago - a machine washable, wrinkle-free blazer.\nIt took us years to get here.

Incredible! $40,000! Thank you all for your support, Kudos and good wishes for Tsuro of the Seas!\nWe have 3 days left to make this next stretch goal of $50,000. That\u2019s a tall order, I know\u2026 but if we get there I will include the other 2 promotional tiles; the Tsunami and the Mystic Portal!\nThe Tsunami tile is a tidal wave that gets stronger on each round of game play. Only the luckiest of Captains will be able to navigate its terror! However, any Captain that can conjure up the Mystic Portal may find themselves in safe waters.\nIf we hit the $50,000 stretch goal all pledges at the First Gunner or higher will receive these additional promotional tiles. We\u2019d love to be playing all the promotional tiles with you at the VIP Tsuro of the Seas party held on Thursday night during Gen Con at the Rock Bottom Brewery. See Update #9 for details.  \nIt\u2019s time to call out the troops!\nCongratulations! You\u2019ve done it!!! Thanks to you and your pledges, Tsuro of the Seas will be on a retailer\u2019s shelf in your neighborhood very soon. Together, this Kickstarter community has exceeded the first stretch goal of $35,000\u2026 what more can I say, than Thank you! As promised, everyone who backs the project as a Powder Monkey or better will receive the Uzushio! (whirlpool) promotional game tile. So, what\u2019s next?\nAccording to the survey, you all wanted the Taihou tile which is a canon for defending your Imperial Red Seal Ship against the daikaiju. We\u2019ll if that\u2019s what you want, that\u2019s what you\u2019ll get. If you are pledged as a 1st Gunner or better when we reach our second stretch goal of $40,000, not only will you get 1 cannon, you\u2019ll get 5! That\u2019s right. 5 Taihou tiles to shoot the daikaiju out of the air\u2026 or the water as the game may have it \u201c:^{D>  \nWe\u2019ve been playing these tiles quite a bit and they are a BLAST to play! Think about it. When was the last time you blew up a daikaiju? I\u2019m telling you, you\u2019re going to love the additional fun these promotional tiles add to the game. But, in order to qualify for the set, you must pledge as a 1st Gunner or better. Just think how good you\u2019re going to look in the Tsuro of the Seas T-shirt as your blowing up daikaiju!\nTo help us reach our goal we\u2019ve added 2 rewards. The first addition is the International Gunner; included in this reward are both Tsuro of the Seas and Tsuro the game of the path. For those of you who want to attend the VIP party, but already have Gen Con tickets we\u2019ve added the Lieutenant reward level. The VIP party is limited to 50 guests; so don\u2019t hesitate\u2026 we want to see you there! Also, you may now purchase additional items contained within your reward. If you would like a duplicate item, please add the following dollar amounts to your pledge for:\nTsuro of the Seas lapel pin - $8.00 ea.\nCustom daikaiju dice - $3.50 a pair\nTsuro of the Seas T-Shirt - $20.00 ea.\nDaikaiju Gicl\u00e9e - $35.00 ea.\nBox Art Gicl\u00e9e - $225.00 ea.\nGame Board Gicl\u00e9e - $335.00 ea.\nVIP ticket - $55.00 ea. (limit 1 additional ticket per guest)\nRetailer Option #2 VIP ticket - $55.00 ea. (limit 2 tickets)\nWe have 8 days left to reach our 2nd stretch goal of $40,000. Tell everyone you know; we can do this! Be sure to check out the FAQ, Update, and Comments tabs for additional information.\nThank you\u2026 and Game On!\nHooray! We are 200% funded and we have 15 days to go\u2026 It sounds like a good time for some stretch goals. But first, I want to thank you all for the tremendous amount of support. Your efforts in spreading the word about Tsuro of the Seas and this Kickstarter campaign continues to build excitement in the world of gaming! There is no doubt, you are a passionate bunch as one can see by the results of the survey.\nCurrently we have 415 backers\u2026 That's incredible! What\u2019s more incredible, is 64% of you replied to the survey\u2026 And I'm telling you it was a very close race! But in the end the Uzushio (Whrilpool) won out over the Taihou (Cannon) by 6 votes; that's crazy!\nI\u2019m setting our first stretch goal at $35,000. This is a number I think that we can easily make if we all continue spreading the word. I'm also going to add some additional rewards on Saturday to help raise the bar\u2026I really want to see more of you at the VIP Launch Party we are holding at Gen Con. I can't think of a better way to personally thank you for your support. In addition, we\u2019re trying to make it more affordable for our international supporters to get involved. Hopefully we'll be able to make that a reality too.\nLet's hit $35,000\u2026 And Calliope Games will make sure everybody that pledged as a Powder Monkey or better receives the Uzushio promotional game tile to add to their Tsuro of the Seas fun!\nPlease refer to the \"Updates Tab\" for additional information.\nInto these dark and dangerous waters, you, the captain of an Imperial Red Seal Ship, are sent to spread the word of the Emperor and, most importantly, to survive what mysteries the seas reveal.\nWelcome:\nHello, my name is Ray Wehrs and I would like to welcome you to the very first Calliope Game\u2019s Kickstarter campaign.\nI've been in the gaming industry now for well over 10 years! I was originally drafted by sister Dawne and her husband Jordan Weisman to start a company we named WizKids. At Wizkids we redefined the way miniature games were played and released a good number of successful titles. Dawne and I, with Jordan\u2019s support, have now teamed up to bring you Calliope Games.\nAt Calliope Games, we publish fun, family-style board games.\n The very first game we released under the Calliope brand was one we originally introduced back at Wizkids; Tsuro\u2026 the game of the path.\n\nTsuro was designed by an incredible mathematician, Tom McMurchie. It's a very beautiful and elegant playing game that utilizes a unique tile laying system that's very easy to learn but provides for a challenging and strategic game.\nThe objective is to simply keep your pawn on the board. On your turn you will place a tile in front of your own pawn and then move it to the end of the path. At some point during the game pawns will start to interact with one another. At that time you will try to push your opponent to the outside edge of the board while you proceed to safer territories. The last pawn remaining on the board will win the game.\n\nTsuro was recently featured on the Geek and Sundry's TableTop featuring Wil Wheaton and has become a staple in many adventure game stores. It has earned numerous awards: Most recently, Game of the Year by Creative Child Magazine.\nWe love Tsuro so much, that we want to extend its legacy with our new game, Tsuro of the Seas.\n\nIn Tsuro of the Seas you will sail the treacherous waters of the Mystic Seas in an engaging game of adventure and suspense! Not only will you compete against each other, you\u2019ll compete against the game board!\nThe daikaiju tiles have arrows numbered 1-5 on each side plus a rotation arrow in the right hand corner.\n\nOn the active players turn he will roll both dice. If the result is a 6, 7, or 8 the daikaiju will move. With all other die rolls the daikaiju remain stationary. When the daikaiju move, the active player will roll a single die that will determine which order and direction the daikaiju move. Should a daikaiju hit another daikaiju, wake tile, or ship then that game component is removed from the board. If it\u2019s a player\u2019s ship that is hit, that player is out of the game.\n\nThe last player remaining on the board is the winner!\nIt's simple... We want Tsuro of the Seas to be successful! The game is currently scheduled for release at Gen Con in August of 2012! Your participation in this Kickstarter campaign will assist us in making that happen.\nYour support will also go a long way in helping us secure placement at your local game retailer. Here's how; game retailers are always looking for what's new; however when presented with the opportunity to carry a new product many of them will gracefully decline due to a lack of demand or proven sales history.\n\nBuilding demand through advertising is very expensive and providing a proven track record on a new games was impossible. Until now\u2026 with Kickstarter. When you support this campaign you will be providing the retailer with the sales history he\u2019s demanding for the product. Our ability to get Tsuro of the Seas on the retailer\u2019s shelf will help others acquire the product long after this campaign has ended.\nPlease make your pledge:\nOn the right-hand column of this page you will see our pledge offerings. Please choose one that fits your interests . We are doing our best to provide you with fun and unique offerings that you can take pride in as one of our initial supporters. Your pledge is definitely needed, and greatly appreciated! Don't hesitate. Pledge today! With your support, Tsuro of the Seas will quickly be on store shelves so others can share and enjoy the experience with their family and friends too! Once again, thank you for your support.\nThe Game:\nTsuro of the Seas is simply an AWESOME game! The autographed copies made available as rewards will be signed by both game designers Jordan Weisman and Tom McMurchie.\nOk, so Swag is Swag and we are offering some of the best\u2026 Back drops for your computer desk top, lapel pins, custom dice, and even a first class bag to carry your games in. But we wanted to offer you more than just Swag.\nTo start, how about an experience that will live in your memory for years to come? Table top games are about socializing and we are going socialize!

(Sorry, you\u2019ll have to provide your own travel arrangements, lodging, and meals at Gen Con.)\nUnfortunately, our memories do fade. However, providing you with an heirloom to share with family and friends can help keep them fresh.\nEver since we originally published Tsuro back in 2004, fans have always commented on the quality of the Tsuro art work. They\u2019ve told us how it\u2019s pretty enough to leave out on the recreation room table\u2026 and that it was even suitable for framing. What a GREAT idea!\nAs you can see above, the art created by Dawne Weisman and Ilonka Sauciuc for Tsuro of the Seas is simply beautiful! And now it is suited for framing\u2026 especially when produced as gallery quality Limited Edition Gicl\u00e9e Prints!\nThis is a Kickstarter exclusive! These Limited Edition Gicl\u00e9es will only be made available here. We will only produce 50 to 250 of each print  plus the *traditional 10% Artist Proofs and Printers Proofs. Each of these fine art Gicl\u00e9es are produced from the actual production files of Tsuro of the Seas. They will be signed and numbered by both:\nDawne Weisman - Artist and Calliope Games Art Director and\nIlonka Sauciuc \u2013 Calliope Games Graphic Designer, Tsuro of the Seas\nEach piece of art will come with a Certificate of Authenticity describing the art, this program, and the edition number. Each Gicl\u00e9e is printed on 290g MOAB Entrada BW Rag paper with UV stable inks. This paper is acid free and will allow these images to become treasured family heirlooms. Each piece of art reflects the actual image size utilized in the game.\nDo not miss out on this opportunity! It\u2019s unique, fun, and affordable fine art! And you\u2019ll be helping us get Tsuro of the Seas placed in your local game store\u2026 for that we thank you profusely!\nAll this is really cool\u2026 Right? We agree, but wanted to take it one step further with the:\nThis is the ultimate version of Tsuro of the Seas! Like the art, this offer will be limited to this Kickstarter campaign.

Each ship will have a protective coating for game play and mimic the original ship color.

Don't want to spend the money, then be happy where you are. Some people even just donate money without expecting anything in return because it is helping to get something awesome out there to the public, to share how cool this game is.

I've set the number of beta kits in the campaign to 25 for two reasons.\n1. 25 kits is large enough of a production run to qualify for quantity pricing and I have secured pricing with www.pololu.com for several of the major components ahead of this campaign.\n2. 25 kits is a large enough number to test and ramp up production while still a small enough number to allow for delivery within a reasonable timeframe.\nSpecifications\nMaximum build volume: 140x140x140mm (5.5x5.5x5.5\")\nFootprint:  250x200x300mm (10x8x12\")\nOperating footprint: 250x315x300mm (10x12.5x12\")\nMaterial: 3mm PLA (recommended) or 3mm ABS\nPrint layer thickness: 0.2mm to 0.4mm (thinner is possible)\nSpeed: 30mm/s perimeters and 50mm/s fill (faster is possible)\nNozzle aperture: 0.5mm \nInput voltage: 100-240V 50-60Hz\nWeight: 8 pounds\nBeta Kit Contents\nYour printer is a complete kit and requires only a few common tools to assemble as well as a modern Windows, Linux, or Mac computer to operate. The kit includes the mechanics, motors, extruder, electronics, power supply, and a sample supply of plastic filament to get you started.\nKit Assembly\nI will be making a step by step series of assembly videos. Assembly will be relatively straight forward and anyone mechanically inclined should not have much difficulty. Electronics assembly does require basic soldering skill, but should not be too difficult.  I will make myself accessible so that I can help with any assembly difficulties. \nSoftware\nThe printer is compatible with popular and freely available 3D printing software. I will make specific tutorials and provide Printxel specific configurations for several options. I will however be making a recommendation for a standard configuration that I feel works best.\nPrinting\nLow cost desktop 3D printers are not $20,000+ high-end industrial 3D printers. It is possible to make prints from this printer that rival the quality of a high-end commercial machine, but it takes a little bit of knowledge and practice to do so.\nThe preferred plastic material for this printer is PLA . PLA is becoming more and more popular within the 3d printer community. Often nick-named \"corn plastic\" and is made from corn instead of petroleum. While printing, it has a slight smell reminiscent of waffles. This is much more appropriate for home use than the obnoxious smell of ABS that is commonly used in 3D printing. PLA prints are quite strong and can be sanded and drilled, but are more brittle (ABS is more flexible) and have a lower melting point than ABS.\n\nThe printer is capable of extruding ABS, but a heated build platform is highly recommended due to the higher tendency of ABS to warp from uneven cooling. An official heated platform is not available at this time, but the included electronics do support temperature control of one.\nThe printer uses 3mm filament which is the most popular and least expensive filament size. Sudden demand for ABS/PLA filament has nearly doubled its price in the last few months. PLA currently runs for around $20 a pound, but as the filament supply increases to meet demand I expect the price to drop in the near future. \nA pound of plastic may not sound like much, but it does go a long way.  The 100mm tall hollow print of my son (shown above in the samples) uses .07 pounds of plastic. Unless a print is required to have maximum strength, a partially hollow print can be used; 20% solid or less is common. Most of the sample prints shown above were printed hollow. \nReward tiers\nI am starting off this Kickstarter with only a single reward tier. If you have a suggestion for additional reward tiers please add your suggestion to the comments section.\nReward Delivery\nThe estimated delivery time listed is when I expect to deliver the very first kit. Kits will be created in backer ordering and will be shipped as completed. Your estimated delivery will depend on how many backers are ahead of you.\nShipping\nShipping will be additional and at cost. Choose one of the options below and add the cost to your pledge. \n1. If you wish to use a Fedex or UPS account you do not need to add any shipping cost to your pledge value.\n\n2. If you wish to use USPS the shipping cost will need to be added to the reward pledge. To compute USPS shipping visit http://postcalc.usps.com/ and select your country and select Priority Mail\u00ae Large Flat Rate Box.\n\n3. You wish to choose another shipping method. Please message me.\n\nI will be contacting all backers to confirm shipping before the campaign ends, but if you have any questions don't hesitate to message me.\nLicense\nThe source files for the printed parts in the kit will be released under a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license. Backers of this campaign will be granted early access ahead of receiving their kit.\nDisclaimer\nOnly skilled users should attempt to build or operate this kit and do so at their own risk. The operation of this kit involves electricity, high temperatures, and other potential hazards. Children should be supervised at all times when near the printer.

The plan for the remaining kits is that I will be working from just the BOM (Bill Of Materials) and I will only be performing test fitting and not actual assembly. If you're interested you can look at the BOM here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xXD9Lbc5E4sZxvonPbvyOFpvKBixbEbL_ZD3-85f77Q/edit\nI've posted the first of the new assembly videos and will be posting more as I edit them. Please have a look to get an idea of the kit's difficulty.\n\n\nI'd say the kit is probably a more difficult kit to assemble than the other DIY 3d printers because you're dealing with metal parts. I'm a bit worried about this because many people have had difficulty with the other kits. Some of the difficulty have been kit problems, but I think many of the issues were due to people not realizing that DIY 3d printing still is an enthusiasts hobby and that it does requires tinkering.\n\nLast update I talked about production rate and after having a better understanding of more of the trivially little details I am going to downgrade my current estimated production rate from 2.5 kits per week to 2 kits per week. As previously offered you are welcome to a refund if you feel it is taking too long to receive your kit.\n\nAfter shipping today I took the rest of the day \"off\" and created a CAD model of an alternate laser cut y-axis. I have been thinking about it for a couple of weeks so it came together pretty quickly. Tomorrow I will send out for a quote and if the numbers come back ok I'll test it out on one of my printers. If it works out it should save a considerable amount of kitting effort as it replaces some of the more time consuming parts. If you happen to have laser cutting resources I'd really like to talk with you."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #11", "update_userinfo": "Production rate", "update_content": "Since the first kit shipped I've been in a production mode and mindset.

I believe I now have enough experience with the production details that I can finally make an estimate to what my maximum practical production rate is.\nThat rate is 5 kits per week. That is the maximum and not my current rate of production.

Just complete focus on following the dimensions as specified on the CAD drawings.\nAlso, if you have had a change of heart about backing the project for whatever reason please send me a Kickstarter message. One person has already done so and I am sending him a check. It is no big deal. This kit is a limited beta and it's important that everyone involved is enthusiastic about the project and has time to put their kit together."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "First assembly videos", "update_content": "I've started making assembly videos and have now posted several along with an index of links.

As you can see the kit starts off with the major sub-assemblies already assembled. This is to ensure that the kit went together reasonably well this early on in the production. As I create more kits and become more comfortable and confident with my production capabilities I will be assembling less of the kits and at the same time creating more assembly videos.\n\nIn my last update I spoke of creating two kits at a time after the mechanics of the first kit were completed. Instead I decided to finish out the first kit to completion including the assembly videos and ship it. Once the first kit has been shipped I will be testing out what my production capabilities are in a more assembly line fashion. The plan is to spend an entire daily work session towards creating the metal parts for just a sub-assembly type while printing out the plastic parts for that same sub-assembly type. The idea being that this will give me a much better idea of the production bottlenecks while at the same time giving me an idea of how many sub-assemblies I can produce per daily work session."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #8", "update_userinfo": "Electronics boards have arrived.", "update_content": "Yesterday I received the electronics boards.

I hope to finish up the mechanics for the production 1 kit tomorrow and start right onto building two kits at a time. After a few odds and ends show up in the mail I should be able to get the first kits shipped out.\n\nSo far the process of going from a prototype to production model has been quite interesting.

Magic, too, is said to work in the cave. But beware! Some who enter are never seen again...\nIn Colossal Cave: The Board Game, you and your friends take on the roles of rival adventurers competing to explore and plunder the treasures of Colossal Cave. The gameplay mechanics are light; it\u2019s a \u201cdraw one, play one\u201d game similar to Fluxx or Dvorak.\nStretch goal #2: $12,500!\nIf we hit $12,500, each Kickstarter backer at the $30 level and higher will receive a USB thumb drive with the Colossal Cave logo on it. The drive will come preinstalled with versions of Adventure and Adventure 550 playable on all major operating systems.\nStretch goal #1: $9,000!\nIf we hit $9,000, each copy of the game (both on Kickstarter and in stores) will come with an extra wooden token that you can attach to your player pawn during the game to indicate that you are carrying the Brass Lantern.\nSo what\u2019s this Adventure you're talking about?\nAdventure is, in the words of essayist Julian Dibbell, \u201cthe world\u2019s first computerized role-playing game and the primal ancestor of all those that followed.\u201d For more information on Adventure\u2019s history, see Rick Adams' excellent website. You can play it online here.\nEver since its creation by Will Crowther and Don Woods in the 1970s, Adventure has been considered (for whatever reason) to be in the public domain, and has been reimagined over and over, from David Malmberg\u2019s expanded Adventure in Humongous Cave to Radio Shack\u2019s rather blatant Pyramid 2000. With Colossal Cave: The Board Game, I\u2019m extending this reimagination into the board-game sphere... and I hope you\u2019ll agree that my adaptation preserves a lot of the fun, the mystery, and the addictiveness of the original Adventure!\nWhat\u2019s in the box?\n   - A 12\"x18\" quad-fold map of Colossal Cave\n   - A deck of 72 cards (13 items, 15 treasures, 28 Actions, and 16 Reactions)\n   - Four wooden player pawns\n   - Saddle-stitched 12-page glossy rulebook\nHow about the gameplay?\nIt\u2019s a light-casual game with short turns, similar to its inspirations Fluxx and Back to the Future. The state of the game doesn\u2019t change as dramatically from turn to turn as those two games, though, which leaves room for some middle-term tactical play.\nColossal Cave: The Board Game has a high \u201ctake that\u201d factor. The average action card is bad for somebody: it might drop an opponent into a bottomless pit, or steal one of his treasures. And almost a quarter of the cards are reactions, which are playable out of turn to thwart another player\u2019s plan: just as you prepare to clamber out of the cave, the player across the table from you might inform you coolly that The Grate Is Locked. For both reasons, this is not a game that you can tune out when it\u2019s not your turn!\nTake a look at what Ryan Metzler of The Dice Tower has to say about Colossal Cave: The Board Game...\n                                                                                                          .\nWhat\u2019s the money for?\nI\u2019m collecting money through Kickstarter in order to manufacture Colossal Cave: The Board Game through a real game manufacturing company. When we launched, I was talking to Panda, GPI, folks like that. But in the second week of our campaign, we've been picked up by Game Salute! Hooray! Now I can turn over all the hard businessy stuff to them. I think the finished product will be much better for it.\nSo, if a lot of people like you, gentle reader, pledge your hard-earned money in exchange for copies of the game when it\u2019s produced, then I promise to pour all that Kickstarter money into the highest-quality Adventure-themed game you\u2019ve ever seen!  The game will have a mounted 12\"x18\" board lovingly illustrated by our excellent fantasy artist; round-cornered poker-size cards even better than you see in the video; real wooden pawns; and it will all come in the same kind of sturdy set-up box you\u2019ve previously seen enclosing Pandemic, The Resistance, or Arabian Nights.\nOh, and the box will also be lavishly illustrated with scenes from the game.\nOkay, now what do I get for my money?\nMost importantly, I can\u2019t produce the game at all without your help! Without you, the whole thing will probably wind up back on TheGameCrafter, with my own shoddy artwork (see video), a flimsy black box, and a cardstock mat for a board. By pledging toward my Kickstarter goal, you're ensuring that that sad fate won\u2019t come to pass.\nBut wait, there's more! A game of this quality (nice art, nice board, nice box) will likely retail for $25 or $30, but I\u2019m letting my Kickstarter backers have it for only $20.\nAt the $22 level \u2014 still well below MSRP \u2014 you\u2019ll get the game and an exclusive Kickstarter promo card! I haven\u2019t decided what this promo card is going to be, so why not post a comment and tell me your ideas?\nThe $40 \"Junior Master\u201d level is perfect if you and a friend both want to back Colossal Cave: The Board Game \u2014 it\u2019s a $4 savings, not to mention that I\u2019ll thank you for saving me a bunch of money on shipping costs!  It\u2019s also a great deal if you're buying one game for yourself and another as a gift.\nSpeaking of promo cards... if I still haven\u2019t decided on the exact nature of our Kickstarter-exclusive card, it\u2019s not for lack of ideas. Pledge $35 or $55 and you'll receive copies of five other promo cards! These promo cards won\u2019t be permanently unique to Kickstarter \u2014 I would hate to lock away such essential cards as the Red Rod and the Breathtaking View from my non-Kickstarter brethren \u2014 but you\u2019ll certainly get them well in advance of anyone else.\nAt the $100 level, I\u2019m trying something that I think will be really neat. Each $100 backer will receive three copies of the game, plus a single uncut sheet of cards straight from our manufacturer\u2019s factory. I\u2019m not sure about the logistics of this yet... certainly the sheet would have to be shipped in a separate tube. But several manufacturers assure me that it can be done.\nNow we come to the really cool rewards. One of the most exciting things about this project, for me, is the opportunity to work with artist Katy \u201cKovah\u201d Grierson on the game artwork. The board and box art is going to be fantastic (no pun intended), and, being that I'm a huge fan of the treasure cards in Tales of the Arabian Nights, I would have liked to put artwork on the 15 treasure cards as well. But there was simply no room on some of them. So instead I'm planning to scatter Katy\u2019s treasure illustrations through the rulebook.\nAt the $200 level, not only do you get a ton of games and promo cards, you also get a single 8\"x10\" print of one of Katy\u2019s treasure artworks, numbered and signed by both Katy and myself. (The number will be between 1 and 15, and the identity of the treasure will be assigned on a first-come, first-serve basis.)\nAt the $350 level, you get all of that, but your 8\"x10\" print depicts all fifteen treasures at the end of your journey, safely deposited in the Well House.\nIf the $200 and $350 rewards sell like hotcakes, I may add a few more art-related rewards.\nLet\u2019s talk about this ADV550 thing.\nI almost forgot! Every Kickstarter backer at the $55 level and higher will automatically receive a copy of Colossal Cave 550: The Board Game Expansion. As of May 2012, this 5-or-6-player expansion is in the final design stages. Based on David Platt\u2019s 550-point Adventure, affectionately known as ADV550, this expansion adds new treasures such as the Mithril Ring and the Scrimshaw Spyglass, new items such as the Singing Sword (it sings Wagner!), and new action and reaction cards such as Darwin the Tortoise and the Nasty-Looking Ogre. It\u2019s also got a new mechanic: Location cards. All told, it\u2019s going to have about 36 new cards.\nThe Springboard Seal of Quality is your assurance that a new game project is worth your time and attention. All titles approved for Springboard campaigns are vetted by the game professionals at Game Salute. During this comprehensive evaluation process, Game Salute works with the publisher to ensure solid designs, thorough playtesting, excellent presentation, and high quality components.\nI can\u2019t wait! Where do I sign up?\nJust click the \u201cBack This Project\u201d button at the top of the column on the right side of the page, and let\u2019s get started!\nI\u2019m guessing that the manufacturing process will take about five months from May, plus some fudge, and you should receive your rewards in the fourth quarter of 2012.

I'd say pick a likely item and make it a light source (I'd prefer an item from the actual game, even if you have to stretch the definition to make it a light source, but something from another well-known text adventure like Zork would be OK). If you want to distinguish it in terms of gameplay from the lantern, I'd do it through other interactions, not by changing the light-giving mechanic.

You can still get the DVD, Blu-ray and USB Bracelet at the No Media Kings store. If you want something else just email us at info@ghostswithshitjobs.com!\nUPDATE: USB Bracelet Reward!\nPre-loaded with Ghosts With Shit Jobs in full 1080p resolution with no DRM aftertaste. After you watch the movie, you can use it as a digital security bracelet -- when the Cloud is repossessed in 2025 (see trailer above) you'll have a local back-up of 8 gigabytes of your most precious data on your body at all times. Alternate \"Locally Owned Data\" text for un-profane environments. And it's not just a geek chic sales technique.\nWe've completed our movie and we're selling advance copies to fund a multi-city screening tour.\nThe video above will elaborate, and also contains our delicious trailer.\n\nIn the future, jobs still suck -- but in whole new ways.\nBy 2040, the economy has flipped and North Americans are a cheap labour pool for wealthy Asian markets. A Chinese documentary show focuses on the \"ghosts\" (Cantonese slang for white people) unlucky enough to have been born into the slums of Toronto in a special report that translates as \"Ghosts With Shit Jobs.\"\n\"Sheer delight\" --The Guardian\n\nIt's lo-fi sci-fi.\nWe've seen too many blockbusters where the writing is in service to the spectacle, and we'd like to invert that equation. B movies are fine, but we like to try a little harder: B+, maybe. We still like to keep the fun in and the pretension out. We squeeze the most we can out of the new wave of cheap and accessible production and distribution technology, and in this case our total budget to date is still under $5000.\n\nThat's impossible, you say?\nThat's what we do. We brought an all-volunteer group of highly talented people together, and created an alternate universe where everyone who contributed to a film was treated with respect, an egalitarian profit-sharing contingency was established, and the writer was in charge.\nConsensus realities are powerful.\nPledging now will not only get you the movie very soon, but help us get it out into the world in a bigger way. It's off to a great start with its world premiere at Sci-Fi-London in the UK, followed by screenings in Berlin, Germany and Toronto, Canada.\nWe'd like this to be just the beginning. Of course, the media attention and buzz that screenings generate will be great, but that's only one of our motives.\nWe view screenings as a creative opportunity.\nWe don't have any solutions to the economic crisis, but we know from the response so far that the movie's premise does provoke discussion and bears further exploration. We'd like to collaborate with local communities to do something extra for the event: it might be having trailers by local filmmakers before the movie, post-screening panels on the Future of Cultural Work, or booths out in the lobby where you can have a fake job interview. One of us would be there in person with the intent to engage beyond the obligatory Q&A.\nThe shortlist for the tour, chosen by the backers after we reached our original goal in 3 days, is in order of priority: New York City (9), Austin (7), Seattle (5), Los Angeles (5), Ann Arbor (4), Boston (4), Chicago (3),  Vancouver (2), Nanaimo (1), Calgary (1), Minneapolis (1), & Montreal (1). We are prioritizing the cities with the most backers, so make sure you set your Location in your Kickstarter settings to make your pledge count as a vote for your town. If your city is chosen each backer ($10 or more) gets a free ticket to the screening!
