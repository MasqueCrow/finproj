We researched materials, incorporated alternative N95 bio-filters, and tested prototypes with our friends and family to bring you a mask that is comfortable, sustainable, and offers better protection than market-leading masks made from non-woven polypropylene or cloth. \nMarcelo is wearing the Light Warrior L1 (Large size) with white filter\nBarney is wearing the Light Warrior-L1\nLight Warrior -L1 (Large Size) - with Black Filter\n\n\nOlivia is wearing the Light Warrior-S1 (Small Size) with Black Color Filter and her own Gold Tattoos applied onto the mask with water.\n BEAUTY MASK + Skin Therapy Layer : \nHOW DOES THE MASK STAY ON YOUR FACE?  Our proprietary sticky material: Skin Therapy Layer with skin rejuvenating Chitosan. PLUS, the Skin Therapy Layer does more than just adhere directly to your skin. There's the added benefit of Skin Therapy Layer healing power: silicone integrated with Chitosan is a natural vegan polymer used for skin healing in medical and beauty products, keeping skin protected, hydrated, healthy, and smooth. Take a look at what happens to the skin of a banana: \nPLAY\n\nSEEUS95 PATENT PENDING HYDROGEL: CHITOSAN AND SILICONE MATERIAL. The same material that we use for the perimeter STL area of the mask, that adheres to the skin, was tested on this banana. After a few days the area protected by the STL material appears  smoother and preserved. Commonly used in anti-wrinkle patches, the Skin Therapy Layer (STL) on the perimeter of the mask allows the mask to adhere right to your skin so you can wear it two ways: with or without an air tight seal. There is the option of a quick release on the chin if you choose to wear the mask without the air tight function. \n We designed the Light Warrior Masks to be easily cleaned and sanitized in many ways. If you are on the go and need a refresher, just wipe with alcohol. If you're at home, just pop in the microwave for 3 minutes (but MAKE SURE YOU TAKE OUT THE FILTERS FIRST)! Doing a load of dishes? Take out the filters and put the Light Warrior mask in the dishwasher. With a dishwater, some water spotting may occur, but that's ok; just wipe off the water spots with a soft clean cloth and you're good to go!   \nPLAY\n\nSilicone is durable, more ocean-friendly than plastic/air spun polypropylene. It lasts longer, and stands up better against heat and cold than plastics. Our masks can be sanitized with a simple alcohol wiping, soap and water, or put in the dishwasher, and even put in the microwave for 3 min (remember to remove the air filter first). During the recycling process, silicone reverts back into its harmless non-toxic ingredients: amorphous silica, carbon dioxide, and water vapor, unlike plastic and polycarbonates. Its amorphous quality makes it like a second skin, flexible so it can have an air seal fit to the contour of all different faces. Silicone has NO BPA: which is found in polycarbonates which can be harmful to humans, environment and the Oceans.\nNEW ADD-ON CHILDREN SIZE XS1  EXTRA SMALL\nFor ADD-ON ITEMS: Increase your pledge to the amount of the item listed, and we will send a survey towards the end of the campaign to verify your items in your package, we ask that you keep track of what you have in your package and that the total of your pledge adds up correctly to include all Add-On Items you have selected.  \nBarney is wearing the Light Warrior L1 (large size)\nADD-ON Option: TATTOOS:  $8.00\n\n\n\n As a transparent mask, the eminent reality of condensation will occur when there is a temperature difference between the air inside the mask and the temperature of the mask material itself. SEEUS95 has an Anti-FOG coating on the inside surface of the mask which will prevent fogging. We also recommend using an alcohol wipe on the inside surface and letting that dry before putting the mask on to reduce condensation. As you can see in the photo above, you can still see the mouth and nose of Marcelo through the mask even with slight fogging. Once the mask acclimates to temperatures inside and outside, the fog disappears. \n MAKE IT YOUR OWN! Show Off Your Personality! \nOne benefit of silicone is that it acts like a second skin. Have fun, be creative, and tattoo your Light Warrior Mask. You can get any regular temporary tattoo and apply it to the mask; jazz it up and add warrior tattoos to unique\u2022ify, but still see your face and mouth so the hearing impaired can communicate with you. And when you're ready for a new look, no problem! Silicone is easy to clean. \nPLAY\n\n EARLY SILICONE PROTOTYPE VIDEO:  56 Prototypes were made in a small kitchen. \nPLAY\n\n *If you try this at home it will probably put you back about $200, ordering plaster, clay, form work, and medical grade silicone.

Learn more about her story by seeing her  TEDxTalk Here:\n Her designs have been exhibited at MoMA and have received accolades from:\n In February 2020, living down the street between the mayhem of two major hospitals, Alice witnessed the waste of 100,000 masks a day. As a Professor in Material Technology, she knew the one time use, non-woven polypropylene (plastic),  N95 masks were not recyclable and have a life span of 450 years. PLUS, these same masks inflicted pain and bruising on the faces of our warriors on the front lines: an air-tight seal means head harnesses and ear bands have to be so tight that it disfigures flesh with sinister wounds. For GOSH SAKES it's the 21st century! Do we really need ear loops? And head harnesses? Using her knowledge on sustainable materials (and her personal interest in skincare), Alice turned to Chitosan + silicone. These materials offer a natural skin-healing solution that also adheres to the face and stays put. In fact, Chitosan + silicone is commonly used on burn victims and used to treat scars!  \nIT's TIME FOR A CHANGE.\nNow we need your help so you can be the first to join the league of Light Warriors who's faces are seen and breath clean.\nWith new pathogens evolving for the past decades - SARS, Swine Flu, Bird Flu, H1N1, Ebola and now COVI0-19-we wonder, what will be next? What we do know, is that Luck Favors the Prepared. The SEEUS95 mask was designed on a napkin and prototyped in plaster, resin and silicone molds in a kitchen transformed into a lab. After 56 mold prototypes and 26 new forms for the air filter, the first prototype of the SEEUS95 mask was born. Our vision? Let's give two air filters instead of one and shift them to the cheek area. Let's use sustainable materials and help the planet. Let's be kind to our skin. Let's make sure that everyone is able to communicate during these scary times. Let's see us again ... \n10% of SEEUS95 proceeds will go towards giving our  SEEUS95 Masks and Solights to our non-profit partners and those in need. \n We Design for Quality, Safety, and Comfort\n and We think You're Beautiful. \nThe \"New Normal\" doesn't have to be a sea of the covered and the faceless. As we move forward into the many unknowns which the pandemic brings, how will we ensure that everyone is equipped to communicate, including the hearing impaired who may need to read lips? What about the social consequences of prolonged isolation? Do we miss a piece of ourselves when we can't share a smile with one another? Our identities and our humanity are linked to our faces. \nLet's Level the Playing Field by Celebrating our Individuality and Be Visible Again!\n\n\n This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have a great track record for delivery on our last Kickstarters.

Simply add your own seeds and watch the magic unfold!\nAs blank Seedpads don't have the built in black cover layer, we recommend covering and adding weight to your seeds while they're in the sprouting stage for stronger & healthier greens.\n\n How does it work? \n3 Simple Steps...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Is It Powered? \nMicro and all of Agriolabs' future modular products will use the Powerplate.\nThe Powerplate and MICRO magnetically snap together, easily transferring power. Each Powerplate can power up to two Micros when used with any USB Charger and up to four micros can work their best when using the Agriolabs high power 3 Amp charger.\n\n        Want to power more? Stack another Powerplate on top of your fourth micro and keep growing!\nHarvesting Your Food Made Easy\nSimply take your Seedpad and cut the Microgreens with scissors or a knife. \n\nNo need to wash as there is no dirt and no chemicals used, just add your microgreens straight into your meal. Whatever you don't harvest can be left on the Seedpad to continue growing for up to 14 days*, ready for the next time you want to add something special to your meal.\n*leaving it longer may result in overgrowth/suffocation which can lead to premature decay.\nWhat Will You Grow With Your Micro?\nWhat will you grow?\n\n The possibilities are endless...\nIt\u2019s The Small Things That Matter.\n\nMICRO is your personal gardener and does all the caretaking for you so you can spend more time living. All you need to do is pour water once when starting a seedpad, or once per week until harvest.\nMicro\u2019s controlled environment prevents bugs, rodents, and other pests from easily getting inside and harming your crops. Built for humans, the magnetic drawer keeps even the smartest fluffy companions out.\nSay goodbye to invasive and unwanted lighting. The enclosed design makes even the largest collections of Micro's easy on your eyes.\nOur Custom, In-house LED Matrix\nEngineered for maximum food growth.  \nWe've tested dozens of light patterns with different diffusive and reflective materials. We\u2019ve even looked at different curvatures to come up with the evenest lighting we can get in a compact space. Our LED system guarantees that all your microgreens will grow to a beautifully uniform height for maximum yield.\n  Why Pink Light?  \nThere's a good reason you'll find pink lights in many indoor commercial farms, and Micro is no different. Using LED's that target the specific wavelengths of light where plants are the most efficient at their photosynthetic process allows us to be more effective with the lighting as well as use less power.\nThe Power of Modular Design\nEvery Micro has zero holes that you have to plug something into. Instead, they magnetically snap together, securely transmitting power to each other.\n\n        All this is possible because of the Power plate which is the base of your stackable garden. But wait... The power plates are stackable too! Magnetically snap another one and make your garden taller.\n The Story Behind Agriolabs and the Micro\n S T R E T C H   GOALS\nStretch goals are reward tiers that become available for purchase or are automatically applied to applicable rewards.\n\nIncluded Performance USB Chargers - Applied to Quad Stacks | Unlocks at $13,000\nWith the Agriolabs Performance USB charger, you can ensure that your quad stack will always be performing at its best without any dimming or loss of power. All Quad stacks and above will automatically have these added to their rewards when we surpass $13k!\n\nSeedpad Include Label Stickers - All Tiers Containing Seedpads | Unlocks at $20,000\nKeep track of whats in each micro, especially if you have stacks of them. We make these stickers in house, just like everything else. Every Seedpad will come with a label sticker.\n\nDishwasher Safe Water Drawer & Removable Drawer Fronts - All Micros | Unlocks at $30,000\nWanna keep an eye on your microgreens as they grow? Simply remove the front of the drawer after the microgreens have sprouted (doing this before may result in poor sprouting due to lower humidity). \nWhile the drawer water reservoir isn't that hard to clean with a sponge and some soap,  we'll make it extra easy by making it dishwasher safe. Just throw it on the top rack of your dishwasher and wash as normal! Easy peasy. \n\nTruly Wireless Powerplate - CAD$35 | Unlocks at $50,000\nThe Powerplate requires power via a USB-C Cable... Or does it? With the Wireless Powerplate, the Powerplate itself can be the power source for your Micro's. Simply charge it up, stack your Micro(s) on top, and it'll last you long enough to grow a delicious bed of microgreens. This add-on will allow you to have true freedom. Want to grow microgreens under your sink? Behind your toilet? On the top shelf of a secret closet? We won't judge, go wild, enjoy that absolute freedom.\nWe have some plans and drawings but haven't done all the calculations to finalize this design yet, but we'll make it happen if you make us!\n\nInjection Molded Shell - Automatically Applied to all Micros | Unlocks at $100,000\nThe Micro is full of intricate details that all work together, and most of those details are impossible to injection mold. The outer shell is not one of them. \nWhat's injection molding though!? Injection molding is type of manufacturing where plastic material is melted, and injected into a metal mold. The mold cools and a solid plastic part is formed. Injection molding is how much plastic items are made and is known to have good surface quality, depending on the machine/finishing process.\nAlthough our 3D printed build quality is not that far off from injection molded plastic, the outer shell of the Micro actually takes the longest to print. It's full of broad simple shapes that injection molding would do a fantastic job of creating. Thus injection molding our shell will result in a more consistent build, and quicker fulfillment. It'll also allow our specialized 3D printers focus on what they're good at.\n\nWant to see more stretch goals? We're open to ideas. Chat With Us\n\nLet's Go Hyperlocal... Wait, What Does That Mean?\nTraditional agriculture is one of the leading causes of carbon emissions worldwide. Growing \u201chyper-local\u201d means your food doesn\u2019t have to travel thousands of miles to reach you and cuts out unnecessary middlemen all while delivering you healthier, more affordable food. This is our first step to making hyper-local the new normal.\nDid you know the average North American throws out about $2000 of food a year?\n        A majority of that food waste is organic content which produces methane gas, which is 25x more damaging than carbon dioxide.\nHyper-locally grown food reduces the demand for less sustainably grown produce, as well as tasting better and staying fresh much longer, reducing the amount of organic waste going to the landfill.\nBeautiful, Sustainable Design\n  ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING  \nIs a term for when you add material when creating something instead of taking away material like subtractive manufacturing.\n\n        The most commonly known form of additive manufacturing is 3D printing, which is used in most components of our products with a special high-quality, high-strength version of the bio-polymer called polylactic acid (PLA).\n  SUSTAINABLE TO ITS CORE  \nYour contribution to less global waste doesn\u2019t just start at your first harvest. With additive manufacturing and high quality, compostable bioplastics, it begins the moment you invest in an Agriolabs product.\n  HOW DOES IT WORK?  \nLike nature, 3D Printing builds layer by layer, until the finished product is done. This efficient process allows us to use our material to its greatest extent and minimize waste which is good for the environment and our pockets\n    THE CHALLENGE.  \nTime. 3D printing takes a long time compared to more traditional forms of additive manufacturing like injection molding.\n\n        However, with our print farm growing and constant advances in technology, we are slowly reaching up to the speeds of traditional manufacturing processes.\n\n        We strive to have the best surface finish on all 3D printed parts, whether that means post-processing or working with our material supply partners & polymer engineers to source innovative materials to further improve the visual and structural quality.\n\nThe Humans Behind Agriolabs\nBragging isn't really our style, but we aren't lying when we say we've got the most amazing team ever. Agriolabs was made to tackle big problems by leveraging awesome technology and out of the box thinking. Everyone in the team is a natural problem solver in their own way and we all share the same mission to do good, sustainably. We start with the MICRO as our first step in our mission to get more people eating what they grow, reducing their waste output and carbon footprint. \n\nWhat we'll do with your support:\nYou've decided to support us with your hard earned money, you can bet that we'll use it wisely. From creating jobs, helping reduce food waste, or building vertical farms in the oceans, know that you're supporting a innovative startup that is willing to take massive action. \n Are you looking for the stretch goals here? You'll find them about 3 sections up :)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhy are seedpads Canada only?\n\nOur seedpads contain organic seeds embedded in hemp fibre mats and covered. This means that most departments of agriculture will NOT allow them to be imported as they are unable to identify the seeds easily, as well as the possibility of certain species being invasive, and other reasons. \nAt this time we are only offering our Canadian backers seedpads in order to keep fulfillment running as smoothly as possible.\n\n\nFulfillment time & process:\n\nWe're looking at being able to fulfill most units within the next 4-6 months of the Kickstarter completing. \nWe'll be fulfilling units of earlier backers first, so if you backed our project on the last day, that's still fantastic and you'll still receive your reward, but it may take longer than some other backers. \n\nWith the pandemic still going strong, please understand that there may be delays in the global shipping system. \n\nBackers's rewards will be organized and processed through our online store system, so you will receive details (such as tracking #'s) regarding your package and shipment by email or text from our site. \n\n\nThe more we raise the quicker fulfillment will be:\n\nSurpassing the goal by large amounts will allow us to bring more processes in house instead of sourcing them internationally. Allowing us to:\n- Bring bio-plastic resins in house where they will be processed, extruded, and used in manufacturing all under the same roof. \n- Get more, higher quality printers and exponentially increase production. \n- Create some jobs! We'll likely be hiring someone to help automate the assembly line, someone to manage our print farm, and another position as well. \n- Get some awesome universal robots to help our staff do all the heavy lifting & repetitive processes quicker and safer.\n\n\nFinal Notes:\n\n2020 has been an extremely unpredictable year so far, and we have no idea what to expect with our fulfillment window extending into 2021. \n\nNo matter what happens though, you had our backs and we'll have yours. Expect frequent updates and reports from our founding team. Our goal is to be as transparent and authentic with our backers as possible.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nThe Micro has a extremely durable build. You probably won't be dropping your garden a lot, but if you do, it'll survive the fall. \nThe Micro is easy to clean with some soap, water, and a sponge. Allowing you to use and re-use it year after year.\nReusability and recyclability\nWith a durable build of over 85% biodegradable & compostable material, the micro will last as long as you will. \nHowever, if for some reason it ends up in a landfill, the Micro will decompose in as little as 5 years, compared to some plastics that take decades to decompose.\nSustainable materials\nThe main material used in the creation of the Micro is derived from Vegetable starches, usually corn and sugar cane. It is renewable, sustainable, and helps use by-product from other industries that would have ended up in the landfill.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nWe're a vertically integrated startup. We understand that it makes it a lot more difficult but it allows us to control every step of the process. From the sourcing of north american made Bio-polymers to manufacturing & packing our own products. \nThis ensures that we operate ethically and remain environmentally friendly. Our manufacturing facilities are also optimized to reduce waste as much as possible, and recycle waste product to be reused wherever we can. All in house.\nSustainable Distribution\nAll our products are packaged in recyclable/compost-able material. We ensure the contents of the package are safe while minimizing material required. Boxes contain at least 10% recycled paper.\nSomething else\nThe very nature of our product is carbon negative.

The problem is fabric mask itself, regardless cotton or polyester made one, does not have the capability to filter small particles. On average, fabric masks can only filter up to 20% of the airborne particles in the air.\nIn plain word, fabric masks alone is not good enough. Filter is needed to add the filtering capability to fabric masks. However, filters comes with different sizes and shape, which means you might need to pair a specific mask to a specific filter. \nEarth Filter Solution\nEarth Filter is created to add filtering capability to your current fabric masks, or any fabric you are wearing. \nEvery Earth Filter is made with 4 layers of top quality filtering materials, which provide filtering ability to N95 standard.\nWith our patented pending Earth Filter tap design, the mask can easily attached to your current fabric masks and add filtering ability immediately.\nEasily Uplift Your Current Fabric Mask\nEven on scarf!!\nWe need your support - and we are offering a awesome launch deal on Kickstarter!\nTo make Earth filter possible commerically, we need your support to reach a reasonable scale for us to negotiate with suppliers.

The dimensions are as shown in the image below. You'll be able to choose the size when we send out the backer survey at the end of the campaign!\nREWARDS\nITERATIONS\nWe devoted all our time and effort developing Blocc over the past four months. Thanks to 3D-printing, we were able to create a number of prototype iterations, conduct extensive product testing, and refine every aspect of the design to ensure comfort, style, and functionality.\nHELP US SPREAD THE WORD!\nWe need your help to spread the word about Blocc. Feel free to use the materials in our press kit. Every post, share, and pledge counts!\nOUR STORY : HOW BLOCC WAS BORN\nThe three wise monkeys using Blocc\nOur team is based in South Korea\u2014one of the first countries to be hit hard by the pandemic.\nWe often noticed people wearing masks and habitually touching their face out in public. After looking into this further, we found that the average person subconsciously touches their face 23 times an hour (source: https://bit.ly/2APII4I) and that this is an innate habit very difficult to break. Therefore, it only seemed logical for us to create a face shield that would block (hence, the product name) the hand from touching the face. We noticed that some people had already been using them, but none of them seemed to look comfortable or well-designed. This is why we decided to make one ourselves\u2014one designed for the average person to wear in public without feeling embarrassed or uncomfortable.\nOur sincere hope is that Blocc will help you become wary of your face-touching habit. With your help, we can make Blocc a reality.\n As one of the first crowdfunding marketing agencies, Enventys Partners has brought more than 750 crowdfunding projects to life through lead generation, campaign page creation, public relations, email marketing, Facebook Advertising, campaign management, and more.\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis campaign is unique in that it began with us delving into a current, universal problem. We sincerely want to see people using Blocc ASAP, meaning we will not deviate from our published timeline and stay laser-focused on reaching the finish line as scheduled.\n\nWe have 6 years of experience in designing, testing, manufacturing, and shipping products globally. Therefore, we can say with confidence that we know the entire process from A to Z.\n\nHowever, no project is without risk, especially if it involves unexpected occurrences. Should a problem arise that may put us off track, we will make sure to fully brief you of the situation through the backer updates section, act promptly to solve it, and brief you again in detail of the outcome.\n\n\n\nRegarding refunds and cancellation\n\nKickstarter is not a store and it does not issue refunds. When you back a project, you\u2019re supporting a creator\u2019s right to try to make something new\u2014and agreeing to go along for the ride. For more information, please read Kickstarter\u2019s Terms of Use.\n\nIf the project is still live, you can cancel your pledge before it ends. However, once the project has ended, and collection has started, it is no longer possible to cancel your pledge.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 24 or more", "title": "1x Blocc -

The cards are made with materials from FSC certified sources. Components are printed with eco-friendly water-based ink and varnish. Our premium components are made from wood instead of plastic.

So from this point on, fulfillment progress will vary by location.\nFor North American Backers: The games are being loaded onto a boat called ATHOS, which will begin its long journey across the Pacific Ocean on November 18th. The ship should arrive at port on December 12. Then, the games will travel by truck to the distribution center, Funagain Logistics, in Indianapolis. Shipping to your house will likely begin in late-December."}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 3171, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/roadtoinfamy/canvas-2", "project_name": "Canvas"}}, {"backer": "Marco Lienhard", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": " #Growfromhome Movement is here! \nPico will help you take your first steps into the magnificent world of growing plants. Easy and affordable, it ensures your plant journey is a success from the get-go. \n\nKnow Your Pico  \n\nAs seen on \nGrowing plants indoors around the year can be tough because they require lots of direct sunlight to thrive. Unfortunately, you can\u2019t carry sunlight around to make sure your plants get the energy they deserve.\nThanks to Pico's multi-spectrum LED grow lights, giving your plant enough light isn\u2019t a problem anymore; with it, you too can #GrowLikeaPro.\nPowered by high-performance power-efficient LEDs from OSRAM, Pico provides all the necessary wavelengths of light to replace the sun completely, and allow you to grow plants all year round.\nThese powerful LEDs are chosen to support a wide range of plants and each color wavelength stimulates a specific biological function in plants.\n The LEDs are mounted on an easily-adjustable telescopic arm\u2014because plants grow like crazy under our LEDs!      Reminiscent of a vintage radio antenna, it grows alongside your plants. As they extend upwards towards the light, extend Pico by up to a foot in height.\nPower Pico through any USB Type-C cable. Included with your Pico are 2 cables to get you started, a short double-ended USB-C and a 3 meter (10\u2019) super-long cable, along with magnetic organizer loops to help route the cable around fridges, windows or anything else magnetic. You may use any phone charger to power the Pico and the optional Pico-timer helps you automate it. \nThe Aluminum heatsink makes the LED module rigid and lightweight; it also helps the LED chips last longer through its excellent heat dissipation.   \nWith its USB Type-C ports on both sides, you can chain up to 3 Picos together with a regular phone charger. Or build yourself an indoor jungle with 6 Picos powered through a 5V 3A charger! Just connect cables to either side, and each Pico will accept and pass-through power to the next one.\n\nRegardless of how busy you are, Pico\u2019s watering system makes sure your plants have as much water as they need\u2014no more, no less\u2014to sustain their health and beauty. All you need to do is top-up once a week. \nWatering too little can kill your plants, but so can too much. Getting it right takes time and experience. Not many of us have it. With Pico, that\u2019s all taken care of for you!\nThe transparent window lets you know when it\u2019s time to top up, typically once a week. Employing just capillary action and gravity, this design does not require any power supply or involve a motor or pumps. Your plants will also grow quicker and healthier due to root oxygenation from below, provided by the ventilation holes.\nPlant pots take up space. They often can only be placed on flat surfaces by windows, which limits your options.\n With Pico, any place is a good place to grow some plants.\nWork desk? Check. Fridge? Check. Wall? Check. Glass window, bathroom or even in a vehicle? Check, Check, Check. \nAll 3 interchangeable mounts are included with your Pico.\nWhy several mounts?  Because when it comes to plants, you can't have too many and you might want them everywhere.\n\nAnywhere is a good place to grow!\nGrow anything you like \nNo seed pods or subscription is involved and hence no recurring costs! Choose any seeds or growing medium of your choice.\n\nPlants Make You Happy\nResearch has long suggested that indoor plants have a positive effect on the human mind and body. Studies show up to 60% reduction in depression, over 40% in anger, and just under 40% in anxiety. And at work, plants have increased the productivity of the office by up to 15%!\nPlants have been proven to improve motivation and concentration, increase energy levels and decrease fatigue. And thanks to the transpiration and evaporation of water from plants, they increase the air quality and improve eye strain and skin health, and reduce the spread of airborne diseases.\n\n\nFresh Herbs Right In Your Kitchen \nAlways wanted to have fresh edibles at hand? Imagine being able to throw your own homegrown, organic basil onto that bowl of pasta, or some fresh mint on your chicken. \nNo more runs to the store for that missing ingredient, having to wash the pesticides and chemicals off of your leafy greens.\nGrowing edible plants can be a challenge. And while the end result is often worth it, it is a commitment most people find difficult to make. With Pico, we made sure to get all variables just right, so you can grow your favorite herbs at home without a hassle.\n\nYes, it's tough choosing a color.\n\n\n Stretch Goals unlocked!!\n Pico tool design credits to Daksh Savla\n\nWhat\u2019s Included\nPico comes assembled and ready to grow. Just take it out of the box, add some soil and water, and a few of your favorite seeds. Plug it in and watch your plants thrive!   \n What\u2019s in the box\n 1X Pico (preassembled and ready to use)\n 1X Power cable (with magnetic cable organizer) (1 meter - 3' 3'')\n 1X Daisy Chain Cable (3 meters - 9' 10'')\n 3X Interchangeable mounts (magnetic, velcro, wall mount)\n\nWho we are?\n We're Altifarm Enverde, a startup based across the USA and India. We strive to offer a healthier and wholesome way of life to all. We believe in Your Right to Grow, Anywhere, Anytime.\nOur design team behind Pico\n Our first campaign was for Altifarm, which led us to switch from a Product Design studio into building home farming products. Altifarm is our flagship home farm with grow lights, greenhouse and mobility packs.\n Last year we launched Herbstation, a more sophisticated compact indoor farm. We've just completed fulfilment to our Kickstarter backers around the world.\nCompared to the other two, Pico is a tiny\u2014but only in size and not in ambition. Our goal with Pico is certainly big\u2014to bring as many people as possible into the fold of Urban Farming. Now anyone can connect with nature and #GrowlikeaPro!\nThis year, we took Pico to CES 2020. We were excited by all the attention\u2014no one could get enough of it!  \n\n Why Grow at home?  \nIs it possible for a Pico to grow enough to replace grocery shopping? Certainly not! \nWith our products Altifarm and Herbstation, we help people grow a substantial amount of fresh produce at home, with soil-based and soil-less methods. If anything, most items that are consumed fresh\u2014the ingredients for salads, smoothies, soup, garnish\u2014Altifarmers grow enough to meet a family's requirements when planned and rotated well\nWith Pico, our aim is to bring up the conversation around sustainable practices in food, and by participation, to have a greater appreciation for fresh produce among family members, including children. \nYou don't need fertilizers or pesticides when you grow your food at home\u2014no transportation, refrigeration, or even washing is required. And certainly, no single-use plastic packaging is involved.\n\n Timeline \nProduct Development \nFor business Inquiries: info@enverdeworld.com\nSay Hi to us: hello@enverdeworld.com \nPICO is fully managed by The Crowdfunding Formula (TCF), the biggest digital marketing team responsible for the top crowdfunding campaigns.

Unlike existing consumer masks, the B2 features a flexible, patent-pending facepiece that provides superior protection and comfort. The B2 is the culmination of 4+ years of design and development, and is now ready to be mass produced.\nAwards & Recognition\nWe are proud to announce that we've been selected as a PRI recipient from the Venn Foundation and as winners of the Protolabs Cool Idea Award. \nDrawbacks of Existing Masks\nEach of these mask types suffers from the following three issues.\nPoor face seals: Existing masks don't always achieve an adequate seal on the face, resulting in decreased protection [1]\nHigh waste and cost: N95 masks are intended to be changed regularly, which is inconvenient and expensive in many use cases\nScalability of manufacturing: Face masks cannot be produced fast enough to meet the demands of both the health care system and general public\nIs the B2 mask right for me?\nThe B2 Mask is designed to provide excellent protection to those who are most at risk from airborne contaminants, whether due to increased environmental exposure or preexisting conditions. People who may benefit from improved protection include:\n The B2 Mask is not recommended for those who need protection against oil-based particles or chemical vapors.\n B2 Mask: Superior Breathing Protection\nThe B2 Mask addresses the problems with existing masks and offers clear advantages over competitive options. These benefits include:\n Comfortable, Airtight Seal: Flexible facepiece achieves Fit Factor above 100\n High-Efficiency Filters: 99% protection from contaminants down to .1 micron\n Reduced Cost & Waste: Scalable filter technology reduces waste and cost\n Durable, Reusable Design: Easily cleanable design provides years of use\nPLAY\n\nComfortable, Airtight Seal\nThe B2's patent-pending facepiece provides excellent comfort and protection compared to existing face masks. The facepiece is constructed from FDA-approved materials, folds in half for easy storage, and can accommodate a wide range of face shapes and sizes because of its flex-hinge design.\nHigh-Efficiency Filters\nThe B2 Mask uses the latest advances in filter technology that provides 99% filtration against a range of airborne contaminants down to .1 micron.\n Particle Filtration Efficiency*: >99.5% at 32 LPM \u2013 tested according in accordance to TSI8130 NaCl .1 micron particle size\n* Due to supply chain shortages, our 1st generation filters will not include melt-blown polypropylene. This does not compromise filtration level except for extended use in industrial settings. Refer to the following section regarding filter change frequency.\nIn addition to providing stellar protection, the B2's filters are easy load with a simple twist-to-lock filter cap.\nReduced Filter Cost and Waste\nB2 Mask uses the smallest, most affordable high-efficiency filters on the market. During normal use, the B2 filters offer 40-50 hours of protection before filtration efficiency starts to drop. How often you change them filters depends on how you use your B2 Mask. See the recommendations below:\n Low use (occasional use while going out in public): Change every 2-3 weeks\n Medium use (wearing consistently over the course of a week): Change weekly\n High use (wearing for multiple hours a day):  Change daily for best protection\nEvery B2 comes pre-packaged with 10 filters, or five filter changes (2 filters/change). You can purchase additional filters at the end of the campaign starting at $14 or only $2.30/month for 6 months of protection for standard users.\nThe B2's filters are small and can be produced more rapidly than N95 masks. This means the B2 can scale to meet the demand of people around the world in search of high-quality breathing protection.\nDurable, Reusable Design\nThe B2 Mask is designed to provide years of comfortable, sustainable protection. The B2's facepiece is constructed from durable materials and is easy to clean by hand or in a dishwasher. The overlay can be cleaned by hand or in the washing machine for easy maintenance. \nTesting & Regulatory Details\nThe B2 Mask is designed to offer best-in-class protection for daily use. Our team is working with 3rd-party experts to test and validate the two critical facets of mask protection: filtration efficacy and anthropometric fit factor.\nFilter Testing \nWe've selected a high-efficiency, electrostatically charged filter media that removes >99% of particulate matter down to .1 micron. The material has been tested for particulate filtration efficiency at Superior Felt and Filtration and at Nelson Labs.\nFit Factor Testing\nA well maintained face seal is critical to achieving high levels of protection. Initial tests using the FDA-approved Portacount 8030 system showed the B2 Mask had an average Fit Factor over 100 - the level required for NIOSH certification. Breathe99 is partnering with leading human factors design firm Anthrotech to conduct additional face fit testing with 25 participants that fill the NIOSH panel for face shape and head size \nRegulatory Approval\nWe have designed the B2 Mask to comply with NIOSH N99 standards per 42 CFR Part 84, but the B2 Mask has not yet gone through the regulatory approval process with either NIOSH or the FDA. In the short term, Breathe99 will work to receive through the FDA to receive Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).\n A note for international backers: Due to longer shipping times, we anticipate you will receive B2 Mask in July (barring any unforeseen delays with international shipping).\nStretch Goals\nIt is through your support - both backing and sharing our campaign - that we can release additional colors for the B2, introduce a travel case, and bring a kids size B2 to market.\n $50k: Second color (Shipping in July/August)\n $100k: Third color (Shipping in July/August)\n $250k: Travel case\n $500k: B2 Mask - Kids Edition\n $750k: All backers gets 10 additional filters per mask for free\nNOTE: New colors for B2 Mask will ship in August due to additional lead-time for sourcing color-matched fabrics and plastic colorants.\nBreathe99: Yesterday\nThe idea for a protective, lightweight, and stylish mask first took shape almost 6 years ago, while Max - our CEO and mechanical engineer - was living in Singapore.\nSince then we've gone through hundreds of sketched concepts, several major prototype iterations, and validated our design with quantitative flow testing. The result is a design ready to ramp up in production very quickly and bring high-quality protection to people around the world.\nBreathe99: Today\nNow we\u2019re a group of engineers and designers with a passion for public health and technology. Our team has over 10 years of experience in the medical device industry, and our advisers add extensive knowledge and experience in product development, atmospheric science, and business strategy.\nMax Bock-Aronson - CEO, Mechanical Engineer\nColeman Rollins - Full-Stack Engineer\nJulia Duvall - Product Designer\nPrashan Subasinghe - Mechanical Engineer\nDerek Mathers -  Sales & Business Development\nEmma Gavala - Marketing & Business Development\nHealthy Together: The Breathe99 Mission\nOur mission is to make the highest quality public health products available to everyone. We believe that each of us plays a vital role in protecting our neighbors and communities, and that it is through collaborative action we can create a healthier, more equitable world. \nKey Partners\nWe've partnered with industry-leading experts in molding, filtration technology,  and soft goods design and production. Each of these key partners are based in the US and are either ISO 13485 or ISO 9001:2015 certified. Partnering with these businesses ensures we can ramp up quickly and deliver the highest quality product on-time to our backers.\nWe also have partnered with other leading groups including the Venn Foundation, Anthrotech, and Worrell Design to ensure we are achieving the highest of quality as we seek to further our social mission of making high-quality public health products available to all.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nManufacturing & Overmold Complexity\n\nWhile the B2 mask is an incredibly simple product to use, the facepiece involves a complicated overmolding manufacturing process. Our design has been evaluated and approved by material and process experts, and our manufacturing partners are ISO 9001:2015 certified for quality management. Still, this does not eliminate the risks associated with transferring to manufacturing, especially with the speed with which we're trying to move.\n\nRegulatory Approval\n\nThe B2 Mask is not yet FDA or NIOSH approved. We have completed bench testing for all relevant aspects of the B2 Mask, yet there are still risks. We are committed to pursuing all relevant certifications - including N99 certification from NIOSH - but working through these certification processes can take time. In the meantime, Breathe99 will pursue the FDA's Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).\n\nShipping & Logistics\n\nThe B2 Mask is a global product that needs a global distribution network. This is why we\u2019re partnering with established 3rd Party Logistics group with experience shipping to consumers around the world.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nThe B2 Mask is constructed from tough, durable materials to ensure years of daily use.\n\nAdditionally, we're working with ISO-certified manufacturing partners who will sample and test the B2 to guarantee the highest quality product.\nReusability and recyclability\nThe B2 reduces filter waste and associated packaging by as much as 50% compared to alternative options.\n\nWe are also committed to minimizing environmental impact throughout our supply chain, including the use of packaging made from recycled post-consumer waste.\nSustainable materials\nBreathe99 is committed to constructing the B2 Mask from sustainable materials whenever possible.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nAt Breathe99 we are committed to working with manufacturing partners who share our sustainable values.\nSustainable Distribution\nWhenever possible, we will offer carbon-neutral shipping to our users.

Our unique, patented, two-candles-in-one design started with the idea that you could create a candle without the wasted wax left over from burning traditional candles. The idea is simple. Why not move the wick from the center of the candle out to the outer edge? Now you\u2019re burning the side of the candle that normally ends up in the garbage. As the candle burns, the sides flow into the middle leaving you with a cozy, wood wick candle at the end.\nWe started Spiral Light in our garage in 2017.  The demand for candles has grown faster than we could ever have imagined possible. This leaves us with no choice but to seek out a new, larger facility and create custom machines to help make enough candles to keep up with demand.  This Kickstarter campaign means we don't need to \"sell out\" to investors or handcuff ourselves to big banks/venture capital firms. This enables us to continue focusing on independent retailers and resisting the demands to put our candles in big box stores or on Amazon. Don't get us wrong, we like our \"Prime\" too. We just also like shopping local and our candles give stores an exclusive product they can sell without fear of being undercut.\nTo find out more about us and to try some for yourself, click Back This Project. Or read on to hear more of our story.\n\nPLAY\n\n\n\n\n\n Unique Design:\nSpiral Light's unique design burns in a circle for the first three hours, filing in its hollow core. This is our \"Party Trick!\"\nLong Burning Time:\nWhen the hollow center is completely filled and the spiral portion burns out, you're left with a wood wick candle that you can enjoy for over 40 hours. That's the \"Real\" candle.\n Clean Burning: \nWhat's the recipe for a clean burning candle? It's a highly refined, food-grade, edible (please don't eat it) wax perfectly matched to the right sized, 100% cotton wick. It is phthalate-free scent oils mixed with vegetable-based colorants finished off with a locally sourced, softwood wick.\nGreat Scents:\nWe work hard to make sure every candle smells great. It starts with a bit of an obsession, add a little love and just a touch of family disagreement and voila, you have our candle scents. Seriously, we work with some of the best scent companies in the United States to bring you great smelling candles without the nasty chemicals.\nHandcrafted in the U.S.A\nUnlike a lot of candles, ours are all made in the United States from raw materials sourced right here in the U.S.  While we've been able to modify equipment to help us pour our candles faster, everyone of our candles is still hand-manufactured by our family and employees in our facility in Minnesota.\n\n\nWe could have just been happy that one of our candles actually worked and set off to make a million of them but we didn't.  We have three different sizes and burn times so that everyone can afford to try a Spiral Light and make them their favorite \"go-to\" gift item.\n\nWe can climb the highest mountain and scream out all the great things about Spiral Light Candles. But, in the end, we are only as good as what our backers think.  We know we have a great product that people will love but it sure is nice to see it in writing.\n\nLoyal to the Local Store\nIf we had a dollar for every time someone asked us when we are going to \"Sell out\" to the big candle industry or show up on Shark Tank, we wouldn't need to look for backers. We are driven to remain the champions of smaller, independent retailers across the Country. We can do this without investors, without big box stores and without Amazon. Just our family, our friends and our backers making a great product for great people.\nManufacturing Capacity\nOur Existing Factory  \nWhen we started this adventure just over two years ago, we took a huge leap of faith and built out our current 2,500 square feet manufacturing space and small retail store. While it served us well at the time, It's already too small.\n\nThe New Space\nThis is the new home of Spiral Light Candles. At almost 8,000 square feet, we now have the space necessary to grow.  We need your help to bring in the new equipment and hire the people that will help us keep up with the growing demand.\n\nNot sure how this whole Kickstarter thing works? Read on.\nTo help us get the new factory up and running, you must become a \"backer\" of this Kickstarter project. To do that, you pick a reward tier to support the campaign - you will essentially be pre-ordering one of our candles or candle packages. In exchange for your support, you will get a special backer discount and deals that will not be offered anywhere else. \nShipping is expected to start in September of 2020, and your payment/credit card will not be charged until the campaign is over, which is May 5th, 2020. \nIf you would like to add something additional to your reward that is not listed above, you can do so by using the Add-On Menu below. Any item (or combination of items) below can be added to your pledge by manually increasing your pledge amount after you choose a reward level. \nConfused? Send us a message - we would love to help!\n We hit our goal! Thanks to your amazing support we hit it in less than a week. Thank you so much.

The good news is we have been making these candles for well over two years. We don't need your help to make a candle, we need your help to grow into a national brand without selling out to the big box stores or venture capitalists. While the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has created a complicated environment for a lot of small businesses, we have managed to stay lean throughout our entire growth spurt. We do this by paying for everything we use upfront and we have managed to stay debt free through it all. We will survive and with your support we will use this time to grow stronger.\n \nYour help ensures that we can grow to meet the demand necessary to stay independent and to continue to sell our super cool candles through independent retailers without the need to sell out. \n\nA lot of Kickstarter projects get tripped up during the shipping and fulfillment stage.

We do however get our long burn time by utilizing an extremely hard wax.\nReusability and recyclability\nOur unique candle design was invented with very idea that we could completely use all the wax that is normally wasted in a traditional candle. When burned correctly there should be nothing to throw away except a tiny sliver of wax and a recyclable steel clip. With no jar, there is no glass to dispose of and the light-weight, hollow design means our shipping impact is less than half of traditional candles.\n\nWe package all our candles in recyclable kraft paper boxes and ship only using starch based packing peanuts and 100% recyclable shipping boxes.\nSustainable materials\nOur packaging is manufactured from recycled kraft paper. Our wax is a food grade, edible wax (please don't eat it). We use 100% sustainable cotton and softwood wicks. Our scent oils and vegetable based colorants contain no toxins nor California Prop 65 components providing a very clean burning final product.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nOur new space uses LED lighting and a brand new and efficient heating and cooling system. We work very hard to keep our footprint as small as possible.\nSustainable Distribution\nOur light-weight, hollow design means our shipping impact is less than half of traditional candles.

According to these reports, viruses have been known to spread through fecal matter.\nUltraviolet (UV) light is lethal to germs acting like silver bullets to these tiny monsters.\nWhy? UV light scrambles the DNA deep within microbes like bacteria, killing them almost instantly. It\u2019s quick. It\u2019s easy. It\u2019s clean. And, best of all, this superpower now comes built into your toothbrush.\nAfter each use, Lumio kills 99.9% of germs using UV light technology. \nA single touch of a button and your brush head will be sparkling clean, thanks to the miracle of science.\nThe best part? You don\u2019t even have to think about it. We designed Lumio for people as lazy as we are. Lumio self-cleans automatically once retracted. Speaking of which\u2026\nLumio is the ultimate travel toothbrush because of its snazzy retractable head. Now it\u2019s easy to keep your brush head clean and protected! Lumio is an electric toothbrush made for those on the move.\nNo more ziplock bags. No more bulky toothbrush cases. \nTravelling is now light and simple.\nNo need to fret over toiletry bags or cases. Just toss it in your bag before you head out and you\u2019re good to go.\nBuilt for modern travellers, with speed and convenience in mind. Stay clean on the go. \nWe'll just say it: we love Apple's product design. That's why we created Lumio with a fully anodized aluminum shell - just like the iPhone and Macbook Pro.\nWith its clean, minimalist aesthetics, Lumio will feel right at home alongside the necessities of your modern lifestyle.\nLumio's high-quality aluminum build means it's bash-proof and dent-resistant, but also as light as other leading electronic toothbrushes.\nLumio is like a handsome viking bodyguard - rugged yet beautiful and ready to follow you anywhere, on any adventure.\nMermaids rejoice! Lumio is waterproof with its IPX7 water resistance rating.\nThat means Lumio can be safely submerged under water at a depth of 1 meter for 30 minutes and be completely undamaged. We're not sure why you'd do that, but we thought we'd give you the option anyway.\nLumio's battery lasts up to 2 weeks without needing to be recharged, making it perfect for travellers. It also comes charged right out of the box so you can get started living your new, cleaner life right away.\nAdditionally, Lumio's charger is small and discrete, so it will take up less space on your countertop compared to other toothbrush chargers.\nLumio cleans using ultra-sonic cleaning technology, meaning you\u2019ll get that icy white smile every time you use it. Each bristle vibrates at an ultrasonic frequency, destroying plaque like a hot knife through butter. \nLumio is a modern, first-class electric toothbrush with 3 cleaning modes that automatically turn off after 2 minutes:\n Clean Mode | A soft and steady vibration for daily cleaning (280 Hertz, with 33,600 vibrations/min)\n Whitening Mode | The vibration will alternate between fast and slow speed, polishing those pearly whites (250-300 Hertz, with 33,000 vibrations/min)\n Deep Clean Mode | A fast vibration to use when there\u2019s something stuck in your teeth (300 Hertz, with 36,000 vibrations/min)\nLumio brush heads are made with industry leading DuPont nylon bristles. We have placed each bristle in a way that optimizes both ultrasonic cleaning and the UV self-clean function - meaning both your smile and your brush will be clean & germ free! \nWhereas other toothbrush companies charge upwards of $20 for a pack of 3 and provide only 1 brush head with the toothbrush - we include 3 brush heads with Lumio.\nNot only that, but extra packs of brush heads are available for as low as $2.08 per head.\nWant to add more brush heads to your reward? Simply add $7 per 3-pack of brush heads to your total pledge price. Later, we\u2019ll send you an email to confirm bristle type (soft or medium), color and add-ons.\nIn the future, we\u2019ll have the brush heads available on Amazon, but for a higher price\u2026so stock up now!\nBACKING | Want to get your hands on a Lumio Brush?

Follow along with all our production news and updates at www.moft.us    \nPeople invented various sit-stand desks since many years ago. But these desks didn\u2019t change much more so far. They usually come with a bulky size and limited by the workspace environment. And some with cumbersome setup may let you go crazy.\nTo make people get a flexible posture wherever they are, we realized we\u2019d have to come up with the most convenient sit-stand desk ever.\nMOFT Z is a truly lightweight and versatile sit-stand desk at an affordable price. It\u2019s designed to offer THE HEAVEY LAPTOP USER a maximum comfort with maximum freedom on location.\n\nA Magazine-sized Desk with 4 Positions\nWith the origami-inspired Z structure, MOFT Z provides one mode for standing and three-mode for sitting.  It helps you develop a healthy sit-stand working posture in the easiest way, keeping you active and productive all day.\nWorking From Home with Right Postures\nThe ultra-versatile yet like a paper-thin desk body makes it friendly to any working environment, not only to be used in the office but also at home or co-workspace.  \nWe designed MOFT Z with a continuous one-piece structure. No tool is needed for setup. Stand it up easily when you need it, and unfold it back quickly when you don\u2019t.\nAll foldings finished in one structure\nMost people usually only want to take a short standing, not a giant stand on the desk all day long. As the same size as a magazine, you can store MOFT Z in any corner you like. Keep it \"invisible\" on your desk. So you won\u2019t notice it when you don\u2019t need it.\nIt follows the consistent design philosophy of MOFT: unseen, unfelt, unnoticed. \nCan you find it? Guess where am I\nSmooth & swift transition between postures\nMOFT Z is a fast-blade to open and close. It quickly switches your sit and stand posture and takes the stress off your back in seconds, letting you get a joyful and relaxing posture.\nSitting all day in the office can be stressful to both your body and mind. A quick switch to standing not only helps you stretch a bit for a relaxing back, but also refreshes your mind with a different angle to see your works.\nStanding Mode\nWhen you are standing, MOFT Z offers a natural height for your palms to rest onto the laptop, and your eyes to look at the screen with no strain or tension.\nSitting Mode\nSurely, you would want to sit back after a short break. Does MOFT Z stopped working by then? Absolutely not. We also prepared three modes to fit your own working style while sitting.\nDedicated flap limiter to stop your laptop from sliding.\n\n\n\n\nThe light-weight body foldable design makes MOFT Z the ONLY sit-stand desk that you can use on your laps.\nUsing MOFT Z on the laps\nWe didn't trade thinness for durability. Apart from the rock-steady Z structure and tri-angle bottom support, We used the fibre-glass to ensure the toughness of panels and a maximum of 22-lbs weight.\nSteady typing in the air\nThe magnetic flap to reinforce the frame, and the PU material to shield all the scratches and heat, while keeping everything soft and premium to touch.\nAs thin and light as it is, you can always take MOFT Z away like grabbing a magazine and work anywhere you feel like, in anyway you feel right.\nYou would never see a desk at the size of an iPad Pro. MOFT Z stays perfectly in your backpack. You can have a flexible working setup anywhere you go like never before.\nTo complete a product is not simply fixing the structure, we want you to feel good even if you aren't actually using it. The vast coverage of PU material makes everywhere you touch feels soft and smooth to your hands.\nThe color on the back not only adds an energetic vibe to your desktop, but also works as an indicator of how you act & use the product.\nA reliable structure also needs to fight the test of time, all corners and folding lines were reinforced to make sure you can always keep using it without wearing or tearing.\nMOFT always aim to make products that all people can buy without having to worry about the steep price. A good design should be everyone\u2019s design. \n\n\n\nPLAY\n\n$500K Stretch Goal Unlocked!\nWe would like to share some cool things: MOFT Z has been honored with the Red Dot Award Product Design 2020! And the 500K Stretch Goal was unbelievably reached, which means that the MOFT Z Leather Black is officially unlocked!\n\nWe found three biggest problems that other products have had: They were too big & heavy for such short time standing; They usually took even longer to store than the already tedious installment; They would still be there even if you don\u2019t want to use them again.  \nAnd we got three answers as well: Small & thin enough to help you forget it\u2019s there\uff1b Fast & easy to use just to save time; Disappear when you are done using it.\nBut a desk is much smaller & cramped than a room, which means we must shrink the size of a chair all the way back while keeping the same rigidity & stability.\nWe then chose fibre-glass as the basic structure for its toughness and flexibility\u2014it restores most deformation under 60\u00b0 foldings, much stronger than usual paper structure. It\u2019s a more expensive material, but it\u2019s more durable for the price. \nTo enhance the basic structure support, we also used 11 built-in magnets between joints to make it even stronger, and snappier when you fold it back and forth.\n\nPeople would still sit down after a standing break, that\u2019s why we must keep the triple angles for sitting position, offering much better usability than a usual standing desk.  \nTo wrap things up, we need to make it aesthetically minimalistic so that it looks and feels just like a MOFT product.\n\n\n\n\nMOFT=Mobile Office For Travelers.\nWe are a team dedicated to design & create products to help digital nomads to work better, healthier, more energized and focused.\nIn 2019 we have launched MOFT Stand and MOFT X Series, receiving hundreds of thousands of support from all around the world, and a whopping $3.2million+ sales throughout the year, making them one of the best-selling stands on the market.\nAnd now we are proud to announce that MOFT Stand has won the iF Design Award!\nThis time, we bring MOFT Z sit-stand laptop desk to you. We hope that all our research, work and creativity has produced a product that will make your office working better.

This is not a toy for children!  Keep out of reach.  Suggested for ages 15 and up. \nCoil, snap, uncoil, repeat. During our brainstorming sessions we could not put SuperCalla down.

We quickly realized that we were fidgeting with our cables for fun as much as they were charging our devices.  We cannot wait to see all the designs our supporters come up with!  Please keep in mind, this product is not only plugged into an outlet when charging, it contains magnets as well.  Please be cautious and keep out of reach of children.

The shipping charges shown are the estimated TOTAL amount you will be charged.  It is NOT a per cable charge. \nOur team researched charging cable standards and what goes into the same cables that come with your devices.  Not so we could duplicate them, but so we could make them better!  We tested hundreds of cables, connection types, magnets and silicone tubes ensuring our cables have superior quality while meeting USB requirements and international safety certifications. \n\u26a1Functionality is key to our patent pending product.

The top finial also features fine knurled details on the outside.\nThe standard stainless steel nib can also be upgraded to a titanium flex nib for an extra \u00a345.\nBronze pens are very hard to find and usually very expensive, which makes the Naos a great opportunity to add one to your collection. Every single part of the pen except the nib has been machined from CuSn8 bronze, the same grade used in high-end watch cases. This material is very heavy and will form an attractive patina with age. \nWe use only the best nibs, manufactured by Peter Bock in Germany. The Naos uses Bock 250 which is a large nib with a 6mm feed, commonly known as a #6 nib.\nYou can add additional nibs to your pledge. Your pen comes with a steel nib, but you can upgrade to more flexible material like titanium for greater line variation. The nibs use a screw-in assembly so you don't need any tools to change them.\nEach material has a different character. Titanium has significant flex (considered a semi-flex nib). Steel is very smooth but provides little flex.\nStainless Steel sizes:  EF, F, M, B.\nTitanium: EF, M\nTitanium Flex Nib - EF\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Naos fountain pen can be used with international standard cartridges (short or long) or a refillable cartridge called a \"converter\" which has a piston mechanism inside to draw ink up through the nib.\n\nAs explained above, you can transform your Naos fountain pen into a rollerball and vice versa by changing its grip section (extra grip section required, add \u00a310 to your pledge). \nThe rollerball refill provided is the Schmidt 5888F in black with a fine tip, a very smooth writer that uses water-based ink which, unlike ballpoints, requires very little pressure to write. This reduces fatigue and cramping during writing sessions.\n\nKeep your pen safe with our custom sleeves which are made by hand from high quality leather that has gone through the natural process of vegetable tanning.\nSimply add \u00a310 to your pledge.\n\nYou can choose options like colour, fountain pen/rollerball, and nib size in a survey that you will receive at the end of the campaign.\nInterested in multiple pens? Pledge for a set and save more!\n\n\nWant to add extra pens? Apart from the sets we offer, you can add extra pens to your reward simply by adding the following amounts to your pledge:\nTo have two writing instruments in one, just add \u00a310 to your pledge to get one rollerball grip section with a Schmidt refill.\nAdd the following amounts to your pledge. The accessories will also be available to add in the survey at the end of the campaign.\n\n\nNamisu was founded by Adrien Cols and Maria Millan, two fountain pen enthusiasts and designers based in Edinburgh, United Kingdom.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have completed five large writing instrument projects over the past 5 years on Kickstarter and we will use this experience to successfully deliver your pledge.\n\nThroughout this time, we have developed strong relationships with experienced manufacturers which is crucial to delivering a high quality product. We are using similar manufacturing techniques as our previous five projects and have developed a production prototype to validate the feasibility of the design.\n\nWe know that there can always be some unexpected delays during production but we have planned for this and extended our production schedule accordingly. Raw materials like metal rods can arrive late during busy periods of the year; machines can break down and require servicing. These are minor delays that may require a small extension to the delivery date of the project, but which wouldn't affect our ability to deliver the project.\n\nAnother common challenge is fulfilling a project that exceeds its project funding goal significantly. To solve this potential issue we are working with large manufacturers that can produce our pens in any quantity realistically possible on Kickstarter. We do not anticipate any extension of the delivery date unless the project exceeds 2000 backers, at which point we would need to revise the manufacturing completion target date.\n\nWe are also working with a professional logistics and fulfilment company which will handle all shipping and packing operations to avoid any delays during the shipping phase of the project.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a339 or more", "title": "Naos Aluminium -

It\u2019s a new take on toilet cleaning. Every other object in your bathroom has modernised, become more convenient and more hygienic, except the toilet brush! \nThe design of the toilet brush has remained the same since the invention of the modern toilet, and most of us keep them within 1 meter of our toothbrushes.\nThis really has to change. The FlushBrush brings toilet cleaning into the 21st century.\n\nYou asked and I listened! Now we've hit \u00a350k in funding the DARK GREY FlushBrush will be available to choose during the address survey at the end of the campaign! \nFor backers ordering multiple units, you'll be able to decide on the colour for each of them between white and dark grey. \nThe FlushBrush is more hygienic in three key ways. \nThe silicone head repels water and waste, unlike bristled brushes. \nThe head is stored inside the toilet, with water passing over it with every flush; nothing that touches the inside of the toilet ever leaves the toilet. \nThe head can be replaced whenever you want to, making it easier to maintain your standard of cleanliness in the bathroom. \nTo use the FlushBrush, just pick up the handle from the base, push to connect the head in the cradle and lift it out to start cleaning. When you\u2019re done, position the head back into the cradle, and pull back on the handle trigger to release the head. The cradle has a magnet in it to keep the head secure. Replace the handle in the base and job done!\nTo install the FlushBrush in your bathroom, lift the toilet lid and position the cradle tightly under the rim of the toilet to ensure maximum water coverage. Once the forks of the cradle are tightly under the rim, fold back the flexible aluminium strip around your toilet bowl, moulding the FlushBrush cradle into place to perfectly fit your toilet. \nThe FlushBrush cleaning head is stored discreetly underneath the flow of water, cleaning the head with each flush. As you routinely use your toilet, the water passing over it will dislodge anything that wasn\u2019t repelled by the silicone cleaning surface, and the regular flows of water will prevent bacteria buildup by flushing the whole system each time you use the toilet.\nFlushBrush's silicone cleaning head repels water and dirt, and has been specifically designed to avoid having any dirt traps. Silicone is an extremely hydrophobic material, meaning water and dirty substances can hardly stick to it \u2013 it\u2019s often used in high quality cooking and medical tools to ensure the highest standards of hygiene. \nThis makes silicone the perfect material for FlushBrush's cleaning head.\nFlushBrush\u2019s handle only ever makes indirect contact with the inside of the toilet bowl. Anything that makes direct contact with waste stays inside the bowl, and is rinsed with fresh water every time you flush. No transferring of dripping toilet juices from bowl to holder like with a traditional toilet brush.\nWe\u2019ve heard stories of children and dogs running around the house waving toilet brushes, spreading germs and bleach all over the home. With FlushBrush, you can store the handle out of reach, and even if someone does get hold of it, you can be sure it\u2019s never made direct contact with the inside of the bowl. In addition, there\u2019s no need to routinely sterilise the handle in bleach, so there\u2019s no risk that anyone will spill a pot of chemicals (and poo!) over the floor of your bathroom...\nFlushBrush saves water. The silicone head is cleaned routinely during normal use of your toilet, so there\u2019s no need to flush especially to clean (as you might with a bristled brush). With each toilet flush using an average of 1.6gallons/6 litres of water, saving on those unnecessary flushes will really add up.\nFlushBrush saves on chemical usage. Traditional bristled brushed need to be regularly disinfected with bleach, which is flushed down drains and into the environment. FlushBrush uses the water already flowing over it to stay clean, reducing the need for disinfecting chemicals.\nFlushBrush wastes less plastic. When you want to change your bristled toilet brush, you need to throw away the whole thing - at least 100g of plastic straight into the bin. With FlushBrush, only the cleaning head needs occasional replacing, and it weighs just 2g of plastic. This means you can still maintain your standards of hygiene without all the unnecessary waste. \nWith FlushBrush, the only part stored outside of the toilet is the handle itself. Each reward tier comes with a free floor base stand, and we will make a wall bracket an option for all backers to add to their order once the campaign ends if we reach \u00a3100k!\nI first had the idea for FlushBrush in 2017 after \u201cinheriting\u201d a second hand toilet brush when I moved into a new apartment. I then began discussing with my roommate why we used such a disgusting and old fashioned tool for cleaning the toilet...\nA lot of thinking, testing and hard work later, we had the first prototype. I took it to a bathroom trade show Birmingham (UK) in March 2018, and spent 3 days talking to bathroom experts. At the show, I realised there were major improvements I could make to the design, and so it was back to work. \nFootage: BBC Dragons Den. Series 17 - Episode 1 (2019)\nAt that show, someone suggested that I should apply for Dragons\u2019 Den. I did, and thought nothing more of it. Development continued through our second and third prototypes, each an improvement on the last, but progress was slow as all the design work was funded just by me. Then, by February of 2019, I found myself auditioning for Dragons\u2019 Den with my fifth prototype. I never thought it would happen, but I was selected to film with just four weeks\u2019 notice. \nTogether, with my amazing design team, we pushed through a few more versions, making final tweaks to ensure everything was ready for me to appear on TV. Dragons\u2019 Den was a success, and I secured two offers from Sara Davies and Touker Souleyman. As many of you may know, not all projects that are funded on TV make it all the way, and ultimately launching a Kickstarter to get the FlushBrush directly into the homes of those that want it most was the best route to take. Since filming the show last year, I have made further design improvements, and am now ready to make FlushBrush a reality with your help. \nAfter almost 3 years since I first started working on the idea, I couldn't be more excited to begin the next stage with all of you aboard! \nClick to download the FlushBrush Press Kit\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7345037/Entrepreneur-TVs-Dragons-Den-unveil-UKs-self-cleaning-loo-device.html\nhttps://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/17889434.dragons-39-den-inventor-tom-keen-toilet-39-flush-brush-39/\nhttps://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/dragons-den-review-new-dragon-sara-davies-was-feeling-flush-wr2jbpbvh\nhttps://www.realitytitbit.com/bbc/dragons-den/how-to-buy-the-toilet-flush-brush-from-dragons-den-episode-1 \n ^ An early FlushBrush demo video to round off the campaign.

We have been through many different iterations of the design and only have a small amount of tweaks to make ahead of tooling and mass production. In the weeks that follow the campaign, these small changes will take place and you'll be kept up to date on the progress every step of the way. \n\nAs you'd expect, we have our factory partners already lined up and ready to be given the green light, and from there production can get underway. There is always a risk that these partners fall through, so we have backups of everything in place and more than enough time in the delivery window to address any issues. As a backer of this campaign, you'll be notified during each manufacturing milestone of the FlushBrush!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nWhile the cleaning head may need to be replaced periodically to maintain hygiene standards, all other parts of the FlushBrush are designed to last.

We design and make cool EDC products. After the success of YSMART 1.0 with 2500+ backers and over 8000 products fulfilled, we received a heap of great feedback.  Now we are glad to be back with our Kickstarter #3.\nMeet YSMART 2.0: The Magnetic Quick-Release Flashlight for Everyday Carry. \nThe \u201cPop-to-Light\u201d solution provides an extremely convenient, easy, fast way to use when you need light in a big hurry. The upgraded version is smallest, lightest,  brightest, more durable, and more convenient than ever before.\nSometimes you just need a strong light, fast. With YSMART 2.0 you get a handy, EDC flashlight that you can take it with you anywhere, and light up anything in an instant.\nNo more searching blindly around in the dark or fumbling around to unlock your flashlight. We\u2019ve done away with the need to twist your flashlight to turn it on/off. YSMART 2.0 provides a magnetic quick-release solution. Simply pull it off your keychain then the flashlight turns on immediately.  \nNever worry about accidentally disconnecting your YSMART2.0. Featuring a powerful magnet with 2.5kg/4.8lb of pulling force, you can place it anywhere without worrying about it falling off. \nExtending the light\u2019s functionality, the magnet can be attached to metal surfaces for hands-free. \n\nWith YSMART2.0, we\u2019ve created our most powerful micro flashlight yet. You get 100 lumens packed into a tiny, robust design.\nWe wanted to do better than the already-stunning original YSMART 1.0, so we upgraded our equipment to feature a state-of-the-art SUPER THIN SMD LED module, which offers maximum output for minimum energy consumption.\nYSMART 2.0 is small enough to carry wherever you go. WOW! Your sports bag, your jacket, and even attach to your keychain. Perfect match for any indoor or outdoor activities. It\u2019s in-interesting that your buddy finds out you\u2019re carrying such a mini but functional cool stuff.\n\n\nThis amazing design is made of signature black aerospace aluminum or solid ultra -tough titanium. YSMART 2.0 not only looks great, but is practically unbreakable.  \nThe main piece of feedback we received from YSMART 1.0 was that the flashlight itself has a magnetic base, but you need to twist it to turn it on and off\u2014so while practical and useful, at times it wasn\u2019t as convenient as it could be.  \nSo, we went back to the drawing board to determine how we could provide a solution to this feedback. How could we improve on YSMART 1.0 ? Make it easy to detach, with automatic on/off! And so, the YSMART 2.0 quick-release auto-lighting mechanism was born. We spent a year on research and development, refining our designs until we landed on the design you see today.\nSPECIFICATIONS\nWeight: Titanium- 12g / Aluminum- 8g\n Width: 1cm Length: 3cm \nMaterials: Premium Aerospace Grade Aluminum Alloy / Grade 5 Titanium \nBattery: LR41/AG3 Button Cell \uff08NOT INCLUDE\uff09\nType of Bulb: Micro SMD LED 2.0\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1000+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $430M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always challenges and unforeseen obstacles that arise when trying to bring a product to life.

Sometimes we ignore it, sometimes we cherish it. \nBut why is sound so important?\nWe spend everyday hearing and listening, it is part of our lives.  Sound is influential, it can be informative, educational, conclusive, emotive, and many other things for us.\nThe problem is people remember only 30% of what they hear. Smartphones can do the \u2018work\u2019, they are certainly not built to be digital voice recorders. \nSo why not try the better solution?\nBorn from a team of researchers and engineers who spend many hours in front of a computer, TileRec is our constant reminder to take a walk and \"stop and smell the roses\", so to speak.\nWe designed TileRec to exceed even our own extremely high personal standards.  \n\n Thin: Only 1/4 inch thin. Fits easily in the slimmest wallets.\n Small: As small as a piece of a chocolate bar ( 2.48 square inch).\n Light:  The same weight as a US penny (0.5 oz).\n Simple: Simple everything! Easy to use, easy to recharge and easy to playback.\n Long-lasting Battery: 24 hours on one charge. Designed to be used the entire day.\n Surround Recording: 360 degrees recording in a 15 feet range. Meeting, lecture or simple discussion - all sounds are easily captured with HQ clarity.\n Resistant: 100% recycled aluminum casing. Sleek design that blends discreetly in the everyday setup.\nWhen we say \"World's Smallest\", we mean it. Measuring in at a staggering 1.6 inch in length, and 1/4 inch in height, weighing only 0.5 oz nothing else on the market comes close with the discreet portability offered by TileRec.  \nTileRec is so slim and small than it can fit almost anywhere you can think of. It blends discreetly with everyday objects - in your pocket or wallet, between the pages of an agenda, on your desk or even on your child's backpack.\nTraditional voice recorders were bulky and uncomfortable, limiting day-to-day activities.   \nThe idea of a voice recorder so slim and thin that it can be used as a  personal assistant is to improve the daily productivity of its user. And is practically indestructible.\nYou can drop it, step on it, even run the car over and then resume recording. \nThe aluminum casing ensures complete protection for worry-free use.\nWhen you combine these benefits with excellent audio quality, you get a voice recorder that is perfect for lectures, interviews, meetings, and dictations too! \nMost smartphones have a built-in voice recorder app that you can use anytime, so they can do the \u2018work\u2019, but certainly are not built to be digital voice recorders. \nSmall, discreet and efficient, Tilerec is the latest voice recorder designed by ATTO DIGITAL, created to encompass the ideal balance between form and function. \nSo, what makes TileRec so superior to smartphones when it comes to recording?  \nTileRec is perfect for anyone that wants to work simpler, faster and better \u2013 without compromising quality. \nTileRec is recording Hi-Q MP3, using a 128 kbps bit rate. You can choose to set it to record in continuous mode or in voice-activated mode to capture sounds in a 15 feet range (360 degrees).\nIn voice-activated mode, the ultra-performant sensor of the microphone will initiate ad start recording only when sounds are detected in the range of the recorder (15 feet) thus avoiding recording long silent periods and saving memory time.\nThe built-in Li-Po 3.7 V battery (240 mAh) needs only 1.5 hours to fully charge (DC IN 5 V 500mA), even when connected to a computer and will be up and running for more than 24 hours.\nRecord the entire day then just plug & play all your recordings. \n*no additional software needed\n TileRec can also record while charging so you will not miss any information that matters to you.\nLet\u2019s get nostalgic for a hot second. Reflect on a childhood memory, recalling an exact time or event \u2014 what you were wearing, who you were with, the sights, smells, tastes. Try to remember how you felt, specific noises like, I don\u2019t know, shrilling crickets layered under siblings\u2019 laughter or, the sound of your mother's voice.\nIt\u2019s difficult, right? Unless the event was recorded, the memory is likely pretty hazy.  \nTileRec is designed to record your daily meetings, activities, and ideas in a non-intrusive way and carries our belief that \u201cwear-ability\u201d is the utmost goal in the design of everyday carry technology. \nYou live in a fast-paced world where TIME is MONEY and you are searching for the best tool to improve productivity and save time?  \n Here are  some situations  TileRec can help you with:  \nThe perfect solution for professional use\nLawyers may use them to take voice notes while preparing cases, while criminal investigators record digital notes in the field, and doctors use it to record important info about cases. If you make a living in one of these fields, you may find a portable voice recorder invaluable.  \nUsing a voice recorder has never been easier. \nSo why not take the leap into the digital era? Stop wasting time and paper trying to keep track of all the information. \nJust slide one button to record and enjoy the Tilerec experience.\nUse the USB cord to connect your TileRec to any computer and select the audio file you need to playback.  It's just that simple: \nPLAY\n\nCheck on Soundcloud the audio sample recorder with TileRec.\nThe Li-Po built-in battery of TileRec is re-chargeable for more than 1000 charging cycles. It takes only 1.5 hours to fully charge the battery, then it can record continuously or in voice-activated mode, for more than 24 hours. \nHave you ever wondered how much paper we use yearly? \nAmericans use 85,000,000 tons of paper a year; about 680 pounds per person. The average household throws away 13,000 separate pieces of paper each year. \nUsing TileRec for your daily notes and meetings saves time, effort and also 1 tree/ person/ year from becoming paper. \nAll this while increasing productivity, saving time and keeping all your information organized with time and date stamp!\n\n Find a reward that works for you and your family, office or team, there's something for everyone.  We are particularly excited to offer fast shipping in the US and EU.\n This is ATTO DIGITAL's  2nd product launched via crowdfunding.  We always deliver. We've learned a ton over our first Kickstarter, helping develop a good sense of our capabilities and timeline.\nThe satisfaction of our users is paramount!\nThat is why we want to make sure that when you enter the ATTO  family you feel the care and support.\nOur Customer Service team is  24/7 available to offer support in more than 5 languages. And because we really do believe in the manufacturing quality of our recorders, we offer lifetime warranty for TileRec.\nWe, the ATTO DIGITAL team, have more than 10 years of combined experience in designing, producing and selling sound recorders and surveillance equipment.\nDownload Press Kit \nOur mission and passion are to listen, so it is also paramount for us to listen to our customers' feedback to better understand how the ideal mini voice recorder should be. \n Our team is ready - so is the manufacturing - now we just need you! \nIt has been a long adventure. From brainstorming to product design, engineering, and branding, it has been a trying, monumental amount of time, conviction and expertise.\nIt has been a stressful, exciting and thrilling experience to design a product from scratch. We want you to be part of our experience! \nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1000+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $430M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have been working non-stop the for last 3 years developing this product and we feel that the amount we are trying to raise is realistic with what is needed for fulfilling the project. We know that the Kickstarter journey is a long one and that there might be several surprises along the way - including foul weather, or maybe even (shock!) our phones running out of battery.\n\nUnfortunately, there are always risks involved in getting a product from the prototype phase to the market, but we have done everything possible to minimize these risks for our backers. Extensive planning has gone into the costs needed for raw materials, labor and shipping and we feel confident we will be able to meet our outlined delivery goals.\n\nOur biggest challenge is the timely delivery of all of our components. In order to keep TileRec at such a small size, parts must be assembled simultaneously, meaning if one shipment gets delayed, our entire process may get slowed down. Hopefully, everything goes according to plan, but if not, we have multiple suppliers for each component, always ready with a plan B!\n\nThe second biggest concern is quality control. While we are using the best manufacturer in China who was the previous supplier for one of the top international consumer electronic brands, we need to inspect each TileRec to guarantee 100% satisfaction. This dedication to detail is time-consuming, yet necessary to ensure a quality product.\n\nWe promise to keep all of our backers informed if anything happens or our timeline changes! If we encounter anything that might affect the product, its development, and/or shipping date, we will make sure to notify you about it with frequent updates. This project is our #1 priority and we will do everything we can to bring the TileRec to its full potential.\n\n_\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nThe TileRec has a rechargeable battery that lasts more than 1000 charging cycles.

And that we throw 8 million tons of plastic waste every year into our oceans?\nPlastic situation in the ocean\nGravity Wave is a project created by young social entrepreneurs that have decided to act so that the numbers you just read start decreasing.\nGravity Wave team: Norberto, Amaia y Julen\nWe want to change how things work for good and we have a very clear objective: Empty ALL the plastic from the Mediterranean Sea. Not only we want to recollect it, but we want to transform that waste into valuable products.\nTwo years ago we founded our first phone accessories company. We were producing phone cases, ring holders, USB\u2026 and all of our products were made out of plastic. We realised that in the smartphone industry everything gets outdated very fast and especially phone cases, 1 billion units that are thrown away every year because of this (some of them even inside their plastic packaging!) We took the decision of turn the whole business around. How could we be contributing to this negative impact on our lovely planet?  \nPlastic recycling\nWe realised that oceans are full of plastic (8 million tons end up there every year) and it is causing the whole marine ecosystem to collapse. We started thinking about solutions, and how we could collect all this plastic waste, as 70% is at the bottom of the ocean and we do not have the resources to remove it. Moreover, thousands of species are dying because of this.\nImpact of plastic waste in animals\nWe needed people that had the knowledge and the way\u2026 Of course, the fishermen! We then spoke with some of them and realised that every day they collected marine litter but didn\u2019t know what to do with it, and that's when we met our now partner Lefteris Arapakis, founder of Enaleia, a sustainable fishing school that has been operating for more than 3 years in Athens, Greece, where they show local fishermen how to collect waste from the sea. When they go out to fish, they dedicate part of their time to fish plastic waste and afterward they bring it back to the harbour and drop it in our containers. We then pay them for every KG they extract and we take care of the rest of the process. \nWe already have more than 130 boats in Greece which are now called #plasticfishers and have collected over 50 tons of marine litter! Along 2020 we are will start to work with the fishermen in Italy and Spain so we can continue cleaning the Mediterranean Sea.\nSo far we take care of the collection and supply, but how do we transform it? We started working hand in hand with Crazy & Things, our partners in Spain, who have been creating, developing and patenting products for more than 10 years. Recently they created Tecnikoa 3D filaments, a project focused on developing and producing 3D filaments. We had been working together in our previous mobile phone accessories company for a long time developing products, and at that time we decided to go one step further becoming partners of Gravity Wave S.L.\nTogether we got the recycling factory in Alicante, where we select, clean and cut into small pieces that are ready to be reused for creating new products. We then send it to the Crazy & Things factory (also in Alicante), where we produce 3D filament and smartphone cases. \nWe already have the first prototype created in our 3D printer with a filament made out of Ghost Nets collected from the sea.\nPLAY\n\nWe have created a business model that recycles and reuses marine litter to transform it into valuable products. But how do we close the circle? Can we achieve a fully circular economy model?  \nThree step manufacturing process\nAll the cases that we sell, if the user no longer wants them, can bring it to our collecting points all over Spain and will get a great discount for the next purchase of Gravity Wave products. With all the collected cases, we again do the recycling process and give them many more uses until they are no longer recyclable, then we transform it into energy with a 0 emissions certificate.\nThe idea to create this Kickstarter campaign is to produce the 6 needed molds to launch the first 13 phone model cases. By offering more models we reach to more people to whom we provide a sustainable alternative creating like this bigger impact that allows us to collect more and more marine litter every day. \nIn Gravity Wave we create sustainable alternatives for our daily life products so that the consumer knows where all these products come from and how they impact the global climate crisis. But we are not selling charity, we are selling quality.\nTechnical specifications\nBuying 1 Gravity Wave case, you contribute to extract 3KG of plastic from the Mediterranean Sea, and moreover, you contribute to sustainable fishing, empower plastic recycling, support local production, local job creation and of course the development of social projects.\nNow we need you so that Gravity Wave becomes a reality.\nContribute to this campaign and be one of the people leading the climate revolution!\nJoin the Wave!\n ESPA\u00d1OL\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 \n1 funda = 3kg pl\u00e1stico\nELIGE TU FUNDA\nEdici\u00f3n GHOST NET\nEdici\u00f3n PLASTIC\nEdici\u00f3n GRAVITY\n\u00bfSab\u00edas que se tiran alrededor de 1.000 millones de fundas de pl\u00e1stico para m\u00f3vil al a\u00f1o? \u00bfY que vertemos 8 millones de toneladas de pl\u00e1stico al a\u00f1o en mares y oc\u00e9anos? \nSituaci\u00f3n del pl\u00e1stico en mares y oc\u00e9anos.\nGravity Wave es un proyecto creado por j\u00f3venes emprendedores sociales que hemos decidido actuar para que las cifras que acabas de leer sean cada vez menores. \nEquipo Gravity Wave: Norberto, Amaia y Julen\nQueremos cambiar las cosas de una vez por todas y tenemos un objetivo muy claro: vaciar todo el pl\u00e1stico del mar Mediterr\u00e1neo.

Nos dimos cuenta que en el sector de la telefon\u00eda m\u00f3vil todo es muy pasajero, y las fundas se quedan enseguida obsoletas, as\u00ed que las que no se venden, se tiran. El mercado de fundas para smartphone tira alrededor de 1.000 millones de fundas al a\u00f1o por no estar al d\u00eda de los modelos de tel\u00e9fono. As\u00ed que nos replanteamos todo nuestro negocio, \u00bfc\u00f3mo \u00edbamos a seguir contribuyendo nosotros a esta causa tan negativa?  \nReciclaje del pl\u00e1stico\nSe nos ocurri\u00f3 que en mares y oc\u00e9anos hay much\u00edsimo pl\u00e1stico, tanto como 8.000.000 de toneladas que se vierten anualmente y que adem\u00e1s el 25% viene de redes de pesca o \"redes fantasma\". Adem\u00e1s, miles de especies de animales est\u00e1n muriendo por causa de este desecho. \nImpacto del pl\u00e1stico en animales\nEmpezamos a darle vueltas y a pensar en c\u00f3mo pod\u00edamos recoger todo ese pl\u00e1stico, ya que el 70% est\u00e1 en el fondo y nosotros no pod\u00edamos dedicarnos a pescarlo, ten\u00edamos que contar con personas que conocieran muy bien el mar y salieran cada d\u00eda a pescar. \u00a1Claro, los pescadores! Quer\u00edamos empezar por nuestro mar Mediterr\u00e1neo, as\u00ed que hablamos con algunos de ellos y y fue entonces cuando conocimos a nuestro primer socio Lefteris Arapakis, fundador de Enaleia, una escuela de pesca sostenible que lleva operando m\u00e1s de 3 a\u00f1os en Atenas, Grecia, donde muestran a los pescadores tradicionales a recoger residuos del mar. Cuando salen a faenar, dedican parte de su tiempo a pescar pl\u00e1stico y una vez lo traen a puerto lo echan en contenedores, los cuales pesamos, y les compensamos por kg de pl\u00e1stico recogido. En Gravity Wave contamos ya con m\u00e1s de 130 barcos en nuestra sede de Atenas, Grecia, que salen cada d\u00eda a faenar y a recolectar pl\u00e1stico del mar, \u00a1y llevamos m\u00e1s de 50 toneladas de residuos recogidos! En 2020 comenzamos con los pescadores de Italia y Espa\u00f1a para seguir recuperando los residuos del fondo del mar.\nHasta aqu\u00ed tenemos la parte de recogida y suministro del material, pero, \u00bfc\u00f3mo lo transformamos? Comenzamos a trabajar mano a mano con Crazy & Things, nuestros socios en Espa\u00f1a, quienes llevan m\u00e1s de 10 a\u00f1os creando, desarrollando y patentando productos. Recientemente han creado Tecnikoa 3D filaments, donde desarrollan y producen filamentos para impresi\u00f3n 3D. Llev\u00e1bamos ya mucho tiempo trabajando juntos y en ese momento decidimos ir un poco m\u00e1s all\u00e1 pasando a ser socios en esta aventura.\nJunto a ellos conseguimos la planta de reciclaje en Alicante, que se dedica a limpiar, seleccionar y trocear el pl\u00e1stico que enviamos desde Atenas en copos y granza (trozos muy peque\u00f1os). M\u00e1s tarde nos lo env\u00edan a nuestra f\u00e1brica de Crazy & Things situada tambi\u00e9n en Alicante, donde producimos filamento para impresi\u00f3n 3D y fundas para smartphone.\n\u00a1YA TENEMOS EL PRIMER PROTOTIPO IMPRESO EN 3D CON FILAMENTO DE REDES DE PESCA RECUPERADAS DEL MAR! \nPLAY\n\nCon estos pasos, hemos conseguido tener un modelo de negocio que recicla y reutiliza los residuos del mar para convertirlos en productos de valor, pero nos queda una \u00faltima cuesti\u00f3n: \u00bfc\u00f3mo cerramos el c\u00edrculo? \u00bfC\u00f3mo podemos conseguir un modelo de econom\u00eda circular completo?\nProceso\n\nTodas las fundas que produzcamos y vendamos, una vez el cliente quiera cambiarlas, podr\u00e1 llevarlas a puntos de recogida situados en toda Espa\u00f1a y una vez entregue esa funda, obtendr\u00e1 un vale de descuento para comprar un nuevo modelo de funda Gravity. Con todas las fundas recogidas, volveremos al proceso de limpieza y troceado para darle \"nueva vida\" a los productos de Gravity Wave. \nLa idea de crear la campa\u00f1a de Kickstarter nace para producir 6 moldes, necesarios para sacar 13 modelos de tel\u00e9fono diferentes. Haciendo m\u00e1s modelos llegamos a m\u00e1s personas, a las que ofrecemos una funda sostenible para su m\u00f3vil generando con esta compra un impacto positivo, ayudando a recolectar cada vez m\u00e1s residuos, \u00a1hasta que no quede ni 1KG de pl\u00e1stico en nuestro querido mar!\nEl primer producto desarrollado con este material es LA PRIMERA FUNDA PARA M\u00d3VIL HECHA CON REDES DE PESCA RECOLECTADAS DEL MAR MEDITERR\u00c1NEO. Fundas que no s\u00f3lo protejan tu m\u00f3vil, sino que contribuyan directamente a proteger el mar.\nEn Gravity Wave creamos alternativas sostenibles de productos que consumimos en nuestro d\u00eda a d\u00eda, para que personas como t\u00fa tengan toda la informaci\u00f3n de los productos que compran y puedan contribuir a resolver la crisis clim\u00e1tica. \nNos preocupa la sostenibilidad, pero tambi\u00e9n la calidad. \nCaracter\u00edsticas de nuestras fundas / Cover technical specifications\nComprando una funda de Gravity Wave contribuyes a extraer 3KG de pl\u00e1stico del mar Mediterr\u00e1neo, adem\u00e1s contribuyes a la pesca sostenible y responsable, fomentas el reciclaje de pl\u00e1sticos, la producci\u00f3n local, y por supuesto, la creaci\u00f3n de puestos de trabajo y desarrollo de proyectos sociales. \n\n\nEscoge el dise\u00f1o que m\u00e1s te guste y \u00fanete al cambio.

Upgrade your dental routine with high-end DuPont bristles with the perfect level of comfort. You'll have that crystal clear smile in no time.\nWe approached the design process bias-free to create something that truly reflects what people want - a product that has yet to be discovered by the majority; unique but in-demand.\nDental care is an essential part of our daily routine that is often overlooked. We invest more than ever in other health gadgets but our teeth are often ignored, despite the fact that damage to teeth is irreversible. To solve this, all you need is a portable sonic toothbrush that you can take anywhere.\neSlim provides a premium brushing experience for all, allowing you to simply & easily adapt its portability, aesthetics, functionality & performance to match your needs.\nMatching the look of the toothbrush to your modern lifestyle and elevating your brushing quality with DuPont brush filaments, three brushing modes, a convenient removable travel cap, and fine-crafted body tube \u2014\u2014 all seamlessly into one instrument.\nOur goal was simple - to design the world's best portable sonic toothbrush to make you feel confident using it in any situation and maintaining good oral hygiene.\n\nWe sought to create a certain aesthetic by combining simplicity, style, elegance, and glamour for the most exclusive product without sacrificing essential functionality. To achieve this high standard, three foundations were necessary.\n(1) Premium Material \u2014 eSlim is all about uniqueness and comfort.  The body is made out of 304 food-grade stainless steel / 6063-grade aluminum alloy that is very durable, and scratch-resistant.\n6063 grade of Aluminum Alloy\n304 food-grade Stainless Steel\n(2) Surface Treatment \u2014 eSlim impressed a valued client with its excellent finishing treatments, which includes vacuum ion sputtering (PVD), anodizing, andanti-fingerprint treatments.\n(3)  High-Quality Brush Filaments \u2014 eSlim's high comfort level is guaranteed. Dentists advise using what feels comfortable and encourage you to brush regularly & correctly. We took that to heart by using DuPont\u00ae nylon, which issimply the best.\nAttraction starts with the first impression\neSlim comes in vibrant colors with a rich satin finish. The brush fits into an elegant cap that encases the entire brush seamlessly for an even more streamlined look.\nThere are three cleaning modes available at the click of a button\u23af Cleaning, Massage, and Whitening\nSmart Brushing\nThe timing function helps you cultivate healthy brushing habits. A vibrating reminder every 30 seconds indicates when you have finished cleaning one area of the mouth, prompting you to continue to another area for a more consistent and thorough cleaning experience.\n\nExcellent Comfort\neSlim aims to provide the softest and most comfortable cleaning experience. DuPont\u00ae produces very high-quality brushes with a balance of consistent quality, wear performance and unmatched productivities in tufting and end-rounding by using DuPont filaments.\n\nHigh Vibration, Deep Cleaning\nWith the highest vibration speed at up to 27,000 vibrations per minute, the newly designed high-speed sonic micro-motor is user-friendly comfortable and efficient.\nVery Quiet\neSlim operates at just 60dB, which is considerably quieter compared to the high pitched buzzing of other sonic toothbrushes - allows you to brush with little disturbance to others.\nIP X7 Waterproof\nThe waterproof performance of the product meets the IP X7 Waterproof standard. This standard ensures effective performance even if the USB port is exposed to the environment for a long period of time. Most importantly, the Micro USB Port itself (while unplugged) is IP X7 water-resistant as well, which means even if water enters the port, it will not damage the toothbrush.\nComes with a waterproof plug\nVentilated & Deodorizing\nThe easy-to-open design easily snaps into place and keeps bristles straight for effective cleaning. Ventilated toothbrush covers protect the brush head and keep it dry between uses. The antibacterial coating keeps the cover clean as well.\nANTIBACTERIAL PROTECTION\nThese toothbrush covers will protect any manual toothbrush & help keep the brush head hygienic.

SomerSide towels have been designed to be soft against your skin so you can enjoy using it like any other towel. We've used the most innovative technology to create soft thread from recycled plastic with a 15% blend of Nylon for that extra softness.\nSomerSide towels have odor resistant properties so leave your wet towel in your bag for the day without the worry. \nSave space in your everyday bag and luggage. Weighing in at only 400 grams and rolling to the size of a small plastic bottle, SomerSide is the perfect towel for on-the-go, no matter whether you're a roller, folder or scruncher.  \nLeave the sandcastles at the beach where they belong with SomerSide's sand-free technology.  If you ever avoid the beach just because you hate the idea of having sand everywhere, SomerSide towels allow you to have your fun in the sun without worrying and the sand!\nSomerSide towels dry 3 times faster than a regular cotton towel so you can be ready from one adventure to the next.

This waste is largely related to consumer gifting, Australians alone throw out 20 million unwanted gifts and enough wrapping paper to wrap the earth's equator 4 times. Australia only has 0.33% of the total world population.... not even 1%.We want to help you and the planet by minimising waste this holiday season. Rather than gifting more plastic, gift SomerSide, a present people will love that helps the environment. \nFounder, Gabby giving some behind the scenes information on our manufacturing and timeline\nPLAY\n\nFREE SHIPPING TO ALL ORDERS IN AUSTRALIA & NZ\nNot the number or combination of towels you are looking for? No problems we can add them on manually. Please send us an email at support@somerside.com.au with the subject line 'custom reward' and we will get back to you ASAP! Expect a response within 24 hours. We want to make sure we deliver your order correctly and so we need to make note of all custom orders. \nFREE SHIPPING TO ALL ORDERS IN AUSTRALIA & NZ\nAll our early bird rewards offer discounted worldwide shipping for those backers that have supported us from the start. Our Santa Pack also offers discounted shipping because we want to help all the eco-gift givers out there. \nOur shipping base is located in Melbourne, Australia and will be mailed out from there. International transit will have a 7-21 Business day delivery time. Aus Domestic shipments will take 3-5 business days. We are a small business and unfortunately cannot offer free worldwide shipping at this point in time but we can offer you a great product at an excellent discount. \nCUSTOM DUTIES AND TAX\nCannot mark as gift, this is illegal, so we will not be able to do this. Our prices do not include VAT, GST or other country taxes.\nOur terms of sale for international orders are FOB Destination. This means that you pay all freight and duties or taxes. As we are shipping these products all over the world, it is impossible for us to build in the various duties, VAT and GST tax for each location through Kickstarter. \nI've always been an adventurous and active soul that can\u2019t quite commit to having my feet in one place. Having travelled for years and worked in the travel and sporting industry, the idea stemmed from the necessity to have a versatile and beautiful towel that could be used for every activity. Personal style has always been important to me and I've combined that with the functionality and versatility of the outdoors. \nSomerSide was created as a more sustainable product to keep plastic out of our oceans and forests. I took up surfing whilst living in Bali, and I quickly noticed how polluted the water was with plastic, it was everywhere. It hit me- literally. I've been hit by nappies, plastic cups, a bag caught on my foot and even have a small scar on my ankle from a sharp piece of rubbish that hit me in the water.  Protecting our environment is very important to SomerSide and myself and we will constantly strive to implement sustainable practices in everything we do. SomerSide is about doing more while using less. \nThank you for support!\nGabriella Samkova\n\nThank you to the Community Creatives for an amazing job in the photography and video production of this campaign", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nUnlike a lot of Kickstarter projects, we've put countless hours and our savings into manufacturing and testing SomerSide.

AvoSeedo has been developed to facilitate the germination process of avocados. It has never been easier to grow your own avocado trees!   \nAvocados have been grown as a crop plant since ancient times. Originating from Latin America, the enormous nutritive value of ahuacatl, the Aztec word for avocado, was well known amongst the indigenous population. But it was only a century ago that the avocado found a new home in (southern) Europe. Nowadays, the pear-shaped, alligator-skinned fruits are a common sight in pretty much every supermarket \u2013 and on our tables. Being outright tasty when consumed fresh and raw, they can also be refined with spices (resulting in the famous guacamole) or stuffed with any filling that pleases your tongue.  \nAlthough avocado trees like to be warm and cozy, they can handle lower average temperatures (as in central Europe, the US or Canada) quite well. The seed of every supermarket avocado can be made to germinate and grow to full size (up to 15 meters!). However, merely putting the seed in the ground usually won\u2019t work. Instead, the \u201cpointy\u201d end should be facing the sun (without being exposed to permanent, direct sunlight). At the same time, the flattened end should be wet all the time.  \nThe main challenge when growing an avocado is to keep it wet all the time. If the seed is left high and dry at any time, there\u2019s a chance that the germination process will stop permanently. And this is where AvoSeedo comes to the rescue. \nAvoSeedo is a revolutionary way to grow the perfect avocados without all the usual hassle that it takes to grow these fussy plants. But what\u2019s new with this version of the AvoSeedo?\nThis version will have your kiddies loving growing their very own pet avocados. The AvoSeedo is shaped like a bear, and comes with many different stickers so that they can customize the look of their little pet. \nIt also comes with a bowl for the AvoSeedo to swim in. There is a little cut out that comes with the pot so that kids can make it look like a pool or garden. So much fun!\nAvoSeedo is the perfect little gadget for kids and everyone who loves to grow plants. Avocados are known to be challenging to grow, but with AvoSeedo\u2019s nifty and brand new design, avocados will grow quickly and easily. \nWell for starters, it\u2019s the easiest way to grow avocados. Our new design is sure to capture kids\u2019 attention. The normally very demanding germination of avocados will be a breeze! \nAvoSeedo is a small, yet intricate tool, which works on the same principle as the toothpick method, only better.  Due to its low weight and high displacement, AvoSeedo will remain at the surface all the time. When the water level lowers, AvoSeedo will sink accordingly.  \nCompared to the original toothpick method, there\u2019s another advantage: the avocado seed doesn\u2019t need to be perforated, reducing the risk of damage and injury. \nDue to its smart design, success rates of germinating avocados will increase dramatically. Watering intervals will be reduced, as water levels only need to be checked now and then. \nAs long as some water remains in the pot or pond, the pit stays wet and there is little chance that the seed will dry out \u2013 thanks to the ground hole. It also allows the developing roots to grow and to expand freely. By the way, the hole is not simply round but has the shape of a heart instead. While this may as well add to the cuteness factor of the new AvoSeedo, it is also a functional feature. It makes sure that avocado seeds of all sizes will be held firmly in its place. Even if the seed cracks open during the germination process, it won\u2019t sink.\nThe brand new AvoSeedo is, without a doubt, the easiest way to germinate avocados, and kids will love their new \u2018pet\u2019. \nHere are the main benefits of AvoSeedo:\nEasy to use \u2013 peel the avocado pit, put it into the AvoSeedo and presto, it\u2019s ready to go.\nNo attention needed \u2013 due to the smart design of the AvoSeedo, it requires minimal care and will germinate without any hassles.\nGreat design \u2013 easy to use with a great design that will capture kids\u2019 imaginations.\nHighly durable \u2013 the AvoSeedo will last for years as it\u2019s made from super strong plastic.\nNon-toxic \u2013 it is BPA and DEHP free.\nAll in all, AvoSeedo is simply the perfect tool for you to grow avocado trees at home. The difficult germination period can now be mastered with almost no effort \u2013 giving your new trees an edge right from the beginning!\nAvoSeedo 2.0 is already in the works!\nWe are already working on the injection mold and start testing very soon. This is great news for you as this decreases the time until it arrives in your home dramatically. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe risk is limited.

Therefore, I have named it, \u201cThe Hawk\u201d.\nOver the past 2 years, I have primarily been working on design & tested various type of knives. I have been working along this line with full commitment and throughout the whole process my priority have been to provide the best possible ergonomic handle and well balanced design for the ease of use. I want to ensure that this knife also meet the highest standards with specific guidelines such as blade, material & resources for better efficiency.\nBLADE:\nThe 330 Layered Damascus blade must impress you as the details are so sharp and beautifully attractive patterns. It is long-lasting due to its rustproof blade making it first choice for any professional chefs.\nHANDLE:\nWalnut wood is extremely tough and therefore, it is the best possible combination to go with Damascus blade. The straight grain retains the traditional look and feel with light to a very deep brown colour.\nI have been collecting knives for many years, I do understand the uniqueness and the highly customised process of creating it. From the design prospective to the actual product, it is where every knife will go through a comparable strength and sharpness test during production to provide you all with distinctive wavy pattern and durability to the blade. \nThe Hawk\nLove for small knives lead us to this creation, a perfect sharp & balanced knife which can be used with fully comfort, indoor as well as out door. \nThere are lots of cheap \"Damascus\" knockoff knives in the market. I have owned few myself previously and one can notice straight away how badly they are made. Most noticeable fact is that the metal has weak spots and is made up from poor quality materials.   \nMy own determination has been over the time to choose the right brand of Damascus and provide you all with something that is pretty and practical in terms of usage. With my knowledge and crafting skills, I'll use durable Damascus that takes time and meticulous attention to detail. Thats the kind of integrity I want to build on this platform.   \nThe Hawk ( 100% Damascus Paring Knife )\nI know the fact that its important to properly heat the Damascus as its vital part of the whole process. Also once its ready, I'll be making sure that every knife has quality the finish, baring in mind that it can rise my costs but it is also my job to provide you with great finish.   \nPLAY\n\nCutting ,chopping ,peeling ,slicing or even dicing with this mini beast.\nFor me, selling online on various e commerce platforms isn't pleasing as I don't feel well connected with the potential buyers. Therefore, I have chosen \"Kickstarter\" platform as my start, so I build upon my knowledge and a direct interaction with you all. \nSince it's my first project in line, consumer feedback is very important to me and thats why I have decided to keep the prices very reasonable. Though, I believe in providing quality, price is just for the hardwork which is going at the background. As you save, I build integrity, relationship and knowledge. \nThe Hawk\n100% Damascus paring knife; Designed & created to serve as paring knife, its simple, elegant & fully comfortable while in hands.\nHawk ( 100% Damascus Paring knife )\n With 330 Layers of steel, full tang & wooden handle \nI am introducing \"The Hawk\" in 2 sizes, (20cm & 24cm) as I feel that will give best combination. I have handcrafted and used traditional skills to come up with these designs. I have given a thought process and attributes which are key, such as;\nHand Forged Damascus Steel\nErgonomics & Well Balanced\nDurable Handle\nSuperior Sharpness\nThe Hawk Pair ( 24cm & 20 cm )\nErgonomically designed Walnut wood handle ensures a firm grip, comfort and add touch of elegance. \nThe Hawk ( Damascus Paring Knife )\n The sheaths are of this pattern more or less, the final look may differ a bit but is make of 100% leather.\n Walnut wood & brass pins adds grace to this knife\nPLAY\n\nThis item is produced in limited quantities only. This means that every piece is unique. Sizes & finish may vary lightly from piece to piece.\nPLAY\n\n Smooth cuts with no drag or food stick, easy to clean and stays sharp\n The knife is not a showpiece, its fully functional and heat-treated to take the impact.\nThe Hawk ( Damascus Paring Knife )\n Its designed to give comfort to the palm. \n Full tang blade (Its entirely a single length with no soldering ) \nBeautiful design with precious look & sharp with full tang all adds character to this hawkish knife and make it a real Kitchen Hawk. \n There are many things I want to achieve through this platform, For someone new, it does makes it harder to overcome certain aspects of the project.

Gone were the days of carrying your laptop charger, phone charger, power converter \u2013 replace all of these with a single Nimble. \n\n 1 Nimble - 6 devices \nOne adaptor to rule them all - The Nimble can accommodate up to 6 devices at the same time, without sacrificing any charging performance across its USB -A and USB - C ports\nWe rely on the broad range of electronics when travelling to keep us occupied during long journeys. That doesn\u2019t mean you should have to bring broad range of chargers that simply take up valuable baggage space.\n \nIs it the same as the Travel Adapter on Amazon?\nWe have picked some of the bestsellers on Amazon to show you why the Nimble is truly unique with a dedicated USB-C output unlike traditional adapter which will share power across output ports. \n\n\n\nIndependently Powered Ports - Quick Charge and Power Delivery\nImagine if everyone in a large restaurant shared one single waiter.\nThe same way traditional travel adaptors share power across all its outlets. Nimble however, offers each of your devices its own personal service. No compromise. No loss of performance.\nThe Nimble utilizes 2 independent circuit boards to power the main plug, the USB-C PD/QC and the 3x USB-A/1x USB-C output \u2013 resulting in  dedicated power through its USB-C QC/PD port to ensure optimized charging for all QC and PD compatible devices \u2013 traditional chargers will share power between all the ports resulting in slow charging.\n\n\n\nCompared With Other Travel Chargers \n\n\nTravel, Home, Office \nWhether you are travelling long distances or commuting between home and the office, the Nimble fits perfectly into your life without occupying noticeable space. Small and sleek, definitely a charger we are not used to.\n The 35W Power Delivery is perfect to replace those big clunky laptop chargers we are so use to. \n\nUSB-C to USB-C and USB-C to Lightning\n\n\nRewards\nADD On Menu: Because Your Nimble Deserves the Best \nOnce you\u2019ve backed the project, you can add additional cables.

The Nimble uses over voltage protection, current stabiliser and over heating protection - One less thing to worry about when you are traveling abroad. \n\n\n\n\nCharge Like A Local, Travel Like A Pro\nCharge like a local and travel like a pro, never worry about not having the correct adapter as the Nimble covers over 150 countries. Never be caught out again when travelling to another country.\n Prototype \nThe Nimble has been designed by a collective of travellers to be the ultimate travel gadget you need for any type of travel.

Off course you can enjoy with wasabi tube.\nThe wasabi-yama was created from the thought to have more wasabi more freely.\nWhen people ordered a plate of some mixed sashimi at a restaurant, a little amount of wasabi was offered on the edge of the plate and everyone shared it, picking it with their chopsticks. \nIt was not really comfortable thing to do for each people.\n\u201cAnd above all, there was too little of it!!\u201d\n\u201cHow could I have the delicious dishes with more wasabi, more freely, we wondered?\u201d\nThis \u201cwasabi-yama\u201d came out of these thoughts.\nWhile we were thinking about what kind of plate, people can enjoy more wasabi more freely then, we heard of this talk.\n\u201cPeople in Edo (Tokyo) won\u2019t allow wasabi to soak in the soy-sauce.\u201d\nPic2\nWe were inspired by it and tried to make a \u201cnew plate for wasabi\u201d and this is its shape.\nThe wasabi-lovers who might once have wished to monopolize the wasabi can do it with this one!\nSize: 11 cm diameter x 3.35cm height\nInstruction: Place wasabi on the top of the mountain and pour some soy-sauce around in the plate.\n\u25b2Hizen-yoshida Pottery details http://www.yoshidayaki.jp/process/#prettyPhoto\nIt is made on a one-by-one basis with great care.\nThe white porcelain in the Arita area has a beautiful white color as its character. \nThe whiteness of this plate comes from the clay itself and the glaze which has been used is colorless and transparent.\nSo, the natural whiteness from the clay appears and this pure white texture is there to see.\nFor obtaining this result, good quality raw materials have been chosen. \n\nFor a mass production of the white porcelain, the mold is necessary.\nThere are 3 types of mold, such as \n1 throw away mold (sample mold)\n2 case mold\n3 use mold (a mass production mold). \nThey are needed to be made depending on each stage.\n1. After inventing a design, a mold (\u2460throw away mold) which is used as a sample (master) is made.\n2. Make a mold (\u2461case mold) for verification \u2460abandoned mold as a model and then after checking the repeatability of the size and shape, produce the duplicate mold for the mass production (\u2462use mold).\n3. Pour the fluid viscos called mud in the \u2462 and make an original mold.\n4. Bake it as it is in the mold to stabilize it. (unglazed pottery)\n5. Pour the glaze on the surface of the vessel to make a film on it. \n During the bisque-firing, the glaze melts and vitrifies the surface. \n(glazing)\n6. Then, bake it for 12~14 hours with a temperature of 1300\u2103.\n(high temperature firing in a big kiln)\n *This is the important process which largely influences the glaze, the color of the paint and the gloss.\nThe work of this time is to produce a product made by using a mold, but it is a very delicate process which requires various adjustments according to the weather and humidity of the day.\nIf the glaze isn\u2019t put on evenly, the uneven color appears after a high temperature firing in a big kiln and it is a persevering work which is required to check the mold one by one during the firing.\nIt is the creative world in which the experience of the experienced craftsman is important.\nWe would like to create the enjoyable daily life using the tableware with which you can enjoy your meals.\nNowadays, we can enjoy the nice food anywhere, and we think that people are interested in what to eat, but they are not bothered in what tools to eat them from.\n\u201cWe would like people to eat the delicious foods together with the enjoyable tools.\u201d\nPLAY\n\nThe meals while having fun make daily life rich.\nWe really want to design these kinds of products from now on.\nAlso, we would like to create the environment and the way of economy for not only the hand-craftsmen who create things but also the ones who mine the raw materials and also the ones who manage mountains doing a wonderful work with a fair price through the \u201cproduct design\u201d.\nIt is a set that you can receive and can easily experience the wasabi-yama, just by your initial support as a kickstarter.  \nThe wasabi, wood and soy sauce bottle listed in the photo are not included in this set.

This is continuation of our original Kickstarter project - Sens the most minimalistic pen. We got ton of great comments to our project, which you can read below.\nAlso, a lot of our customers asked about the opportunity to choose body and cap colors separately, so now we have 12 colors (instead of original 4 colors).\nTo make even more personal touch, we added an opportunity to add Personal Engraving for leather accessories and pen stand.\nExample of Personal Engraving option on leather notebook cover, wooden pen stand and leather pen sleeve\nOUR NEW COLORS\n\n I think my previous backers will say better than me :) Haha\nTHE PEN.\n       Pen is the essential attribute of our everyday life. It is not just a writing instrument, it is tool for self-expression. It embodies soul and wisdom of its owner. Pen is an extension of your thoughts, goals and achievements.\n\n\n       Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.\n\n\nSpecifications: \nMinimalistic design\nPerfect balance\nErgonomic design\nAnodized aircraft aluminum\nCNC-machined\nWooden pen stand\nSchmidt P8126 capless roller ball pen refill (0,6 mm)\nComparable with any Parker style G2 refills\n\n\nTwisting mechanism in work.\nDimensions & weight: \nLength 136 mm (5,35 in)\nDiameter at widest point - 11mm, at narrowest \u2013 9mm\nWeight \u2013 28 grams (1 oz)\n\nOur pen consists only from two solid metal parts, refill and spring.\n CHOOSE YOUR COLOR.\n\nPEN STAND. \n        We put a lot of attention to our packaging too, as it makes the first impression on product. Every pen will be packed in beautifully designed box. Also it could be a pen stand on your desk. We made stands in walnut, for perfect match with your interior.\nBlack Sens pen with walnut pen stand\nPackaging of a Sens pen.\nPEN CASE.  \n        To keep your pen safe, we made a minimalistic sleeve. It`s made from a solid piece of vegetable tanned leather, which will gain deep rich tint as time goes by. Every sleeve is hand sewn with great attention to every stitch.\nBeige, red, brown and black pen sleeves\nMinimalistic leather pen sleeve.\n REWARDS.\n\n\n\nADD-ONS.\n       The add-ons are added to your original EXISTING reward that you pledged for. You can add a pen sleeve or an extra refill to your current pledge. To add an add-on, simply include the amount in the pledge.\nFor example:\n        If you made a $39 SENS PEN pledge and you would like to add a pen sleeve (+12$) and an extra refill (+3$), simply add $15 to your pledge and enter \"54$\" without changing the reward category.\nDESIGN. \n               The pen was reinvented. Our pen is very simple, it consists only from two solid parts. A subtle teardrop shape, gives it a great balance to write, with comfort and steadiness. The pen fits nicely in a hand and does not slip.\nSens pen is perfectly balanced.\n\n\n\n\n      The pen is made from aluminum, known for its durability and lightness. Precision machinery and skillful workers are needed to create the perfect writing instrument for you.\nMachining Sens pen\nWRITING.   \n       Not only the pen looks good, it writes even better. We have tried and tested different types of ink and have chosen the best one for you. It is an innovative system for smooth and elegant writing. It combines the convenience of a ballpoint pen with the individual writing characteristics of a fountain pen. Every pen will come with Schmidt P8126 capless roller ball refill, perfect for writing, drawing and taking notes.\n       If you will need a replacement, you won`t have problems finding it. Our pen is compatible with any Parker-style G2 refill (more than 100), which is a standard refill for a variety of pens. So whenever you\u2019ll need it, there will always be a plenty to choose from.\n       We came a long way from first sketches to final prototype. Now we need your SUPPORT to start full production. We need funds for manufacturing, assembling, packaging and shipping to YOU.\nNOTEBOOK COVER.\nPLAY\n\n       To keep your pen and notebook together, we created a simple, yet functional cover. Under its minimalist look there are compartments for the notebook and pen, two slots for cards and a small pocket for some little things that may be handy throughout your day. The cover is also a stylish accessory that's hard to let off your hands, moreover to forget at home.\n       The cover is made from natural vegetable tanned leather to give it strength and a nice texture. It also develops a rich tint as time goes on. The leather is cut with a laser for precision and accuracy that are impossible to achieve while cutting by hand.\n      But the sewing is only done manually \u2013 it is far more difficult, but the stitches come out stronger and last longer. As a final step, we carefully treat the edges of the leather to give the cover its finished look and provide you with a product that is ideal in every detail.\n       Simple like everything ingenious, this set is great to have around. It gives an ability to write down, sketch, plan and organize your plans and ideas to turn them into successful achievements in the future.\nSpecifications:\nVegetable tanned leather\nNylon thread\nHand sewn\nPen sleeve\n155mm x 115mm ( 6,1 \" x 4,5 \" )", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have experience with 6 successful projects on Kickstarter, so process of production and delivery is well established.

Providing instant coolness and ultimate comfort.  \nSilver has been used by NASA, US Special Forces, and Olympic athletes to create germ free textiles. Bamboo charcoal\u2019s activated carbon absorb toxins, prevents mould growth and purifies air by absorbing harmful gasses.\nAir Cells increase comfort and breathability that is linked to sweating and snoring during sleeping. The combination of the textiles wick moisture away twice as fast as cotton, reducing the humidity in your bed by up to 50%. \nThe problem with traditional pillows is that they require porous materials to create a soft comfortable feel. In as little as 7 days, millions of colony forming units of bacteria can grow inside this permeable space where mold and other pathogens can thrive. This leads to allergies, skin irritation and many illnesses. \nAlpha's bamboo charcoal infused memory foam allows the pillow to mould into the shape of your head and neck, supporting the sensitive pressure areas to help you relax and help with insomnia. \nImpinged nerves can trigger migraines, ensuring that your spine is alined correctly in its natural position it will minimize nerve irritation. It will also help to relieve muscle tension around the neck area. \nAlpha allows your spine to be alined and it elevates your upper body, unblocking the airways and opening nasal passages so you can breathe easier. Alpha's Dimensions: 60 x 40 x 12 cm.\nSilver binds to essential cell components like DNA to neutralize their harmful effect. The process of minimizing the bacteria helps with eliminating odor, prevents allergies such as skin irritations, pimples, asthma, runny nose, sneezing and more.

Australia\u2019s long isolation and vast area has created an ideal setting for nature to express its incredible diversity. More than 90 percent of the 30,000 different plant species found in Australia are found only in Australia! Our aim at NativeRepublica is to bring some of those truly unique flowers and plants to the rest of the world. To share something that will grow and blossom. \nOUR STORY\n....................................\nJust over a year ago my husband and I travelled around Australia camping for 5 months. We set off from my hometown of Newcastle, Australia on what was to be the most amazing adventure. What really struck me about that trip, besides the vast size of the country, was the range of amazingly beautiful, vibrate and burley wildflowers. Colours and forms truly unique to Australia. Mid last year my husband and I moved to his hometown in Switzerland and I began to deeply miss the unique smells and sights of Australia. That was when I decided to bring a little bit of Australia with me. I started NativeRepublica to showcase and celebrate the joyful heirloom wildflowers of Australia and bring their beauty to the rest of the world. We have since been working on sourcing the best native Australian wildflower seeds to share with the world.\nVIDEO\n....................................\nOUR RANGE\n....................................\nWe\u2019ve selected six of the most unique Australian wildflowers:\nTHE PRODUCT\n....................................\nOur eco-friendly packets of native wildflower seeds are sold individually or as a gift pack of three. Each vibrant packet of seeds contains sowing and care instructions, native seeds and a sowing label.\nTHE GIFT PACK\n....................................\nOur gift pack of three individual seed packets. \nAs part of this Kickstarter campaign we are offering a special on our gift pack of Bottlebrush seeds, Kangaroo Paw seeds and Blue Rottnest Island Daisy seeds (special only available through KickStarter).\nNow that we have reached our streach goal we can introduce two new gift pack options!!!!\nTHE FLOWERS\n....................................\n1. Sturt\u2019s Desert Pea\nThe Strut\u2019s Desert Pea is the most iconic and unique Australian wildflower. Not only that, it\u2019s also the emblem of South Australia. I spent a good part of our trip intensely looking for this amazing flower in the wild. Originating from the deserts of South Australia and the Northern Territory the Sturt\u2019s Desert Pea eluded me. I can only imagine what Charles Sturt would have though seeing its distinctive elongated red flowers and piercing black eye on his 1814 journey into the depths of Australia in search of an inland sea. Nothing else in the world compares to the Sturt\u2019s Desert Pea. The red beauty looks like a tough customer but is actually very endearing. They love to be in frost-free positions with excellent drainage, either in a container or sandy garden bed.\n2. Bottle Brush\nThe vibrant red flowers of Bottle Brush played such an important part of my childhood. The memory of being fascinated by their soft bizarre brush head is so vivid in my mind. This magnificent flower is an iconic plant, well-recognised in Australia and increasingly in gardens throughout the world. It easy to grow, hardy and very adaptable. The vibrant red colour is a magnet for wildlife and birds, they just love it! This versatile plant in also known by indigenous Australians as a beautiful tea, what a superstar!\n3. Blue Rottnest Island Daisy\nAs if Australia was not isolated enough! This little beauty originates from the even more remote Rottnest Island, located off the coast of Western Australia. It\u2019s long slender strokes are topped a striking pincushion like array of petite bluey purple blooms. Insects love the pretty blue flowers including snails so be sure to protect them when they are juvenile. Blue Rottnest Island Daisies are super easy to grow so no garden has any excuse to be without them.\n4. Wattle\nIn Australia you know summer has arrived when you see those big blooms of glowing golden Wattle flowers. I can\u2019t remember a summer where I didn\u2019t stop and admire Wattle\u2019s vibrant presents. This plant has the amazing power of being able to immediately infuse happiness \u263a Glorious Wattle is our national flower in Australia. We even have \u2018Wattle Day\u2019 on September 1 every year! That\u2019s how much we love this plant. Wattle belongs to the same family as the more common Mimosa and Thorntree variety of Acacia. Staggeringly 950 of the 1300 Acacia species abound worldwide are native to Australia. This plant is not just a pretty face, although undoubtedly highly ornamental, wattle seeds plays an important part in ingenious Australians medicine. Easy to grow, this plant is a must in any garden.\n5. Geraldton Wax\nGeraldton wax is having a comeback moment. Its long been appreciated as a hardy plant with profusely long lasting pretty pink waxy flowers. It is an iconic Australian plant and one of the world\u2019s best cut flowers. The aroma when crushing the foliage between your fingers is to die for. This flower is super robust, fast growing and most importantly copes well with irregular watering so its perfect for the lazy gardener ;) Use the cut flowers in the home as they will last up to a week.\n6. Kangaroo Paw\nKangaroo Paw plant is stunning full stop. With its long elegantly flattened leaves and beautiful brilliant green flowers bloom that fans out like a cluster this flower is truly truly unique. Each Kangaroo Paw flower has a bright red ovary which, with the unusual paw-shaped flowers, gives the flower its very fitting name. Its paws are soft and velvety with fine brightly coloured hairs covering the entire surface. This fury little guy sturdy stem is a natural perch for birds. The blooms are long lasting and make amazing cut flowers.\nOUR PEOPLE\n....................................\nGreen thumbs who want a truly unique garden full of heirloom native flowers\nTravellers who want to bring a little unique magic home with them\nGivers of unique eco-friendly gifts. \nPeople who want something uniquely beautiful that will grow and blossom for years to come \nThe Goals\n.......................\nRaise $1,000 AUD to buy supplies and packaging\nThe stretch goals: $2,000 AUD introduce new wildflower varieties to the range $3,000 AUD introduce fruits, herbs and spice plants to the range.\nWILL THEY GROW?\n....................................\nAustralian wildflowers have evolved to fill every available habitat on the huge continent from hot dry to frosty mountaintops. Our range of wildflowers grow naturally in USDA hardiness zones 5-12. Outside of these zones they can be grown in a green house.\nBest of all most of our flowers are perennial! with the exception of Blue Rottnest Island Daisy it is erect annual or biannual. Re-propagation shouldn't be an issue.

Each country has its own rules about bringing in plant and plant products (i.e. seeds). It\u2019s always best to check with your country\u2019s customs and quarantine laws before making a pledge. Most countries allow non-commercial quantities to enter without any paperwork however some require a Phytosanitary Certificate. \nUNITED STATES\nIf you live in the United States, \"up to 50 seeds per species\" can be imported under the Small Seed Lots Permit without a Phytosanitary Certificate. https://www.aphis.usda.gov/plant_health/permits...\nEUROPE\nSimilarly in Europe \"Small quantities of plants, plant products, foodstuffs or animal feed that their owner or recipient will use for non-industrial, non-commercial purposes or consume during transport\" do not need a certificatehttps://ec.europa.eu/food/plant/plant_health_biosecurity/non_eu_trade_en\nCANADA\n\"Small lots\" of seed, i.e., quantities of less than 5 kg of large seeded kinds such as peas, beans and corn or quantities of less than 500 g of small seeded kinds such as carrot or alfalfa, are exempted from providing an import declaration or a seed analysis certificate and do not require an ICA. Most seed imported by Canadian gardeners would fall under the \"small lot\" category. http://www.inspection.gc.ca/plants/seeds/imports/small-packet-seed/eng/1470410938949/1470410961778\nNEW ZEALAND\nWe don't recommend purchasing our seeds for delivery to New Zealand due to our strict quarantine requirements.\nARE THEY INVASIVE?\n..........................\nEach native environment is unique and diverse. Sometimes introducing a new species into the harmonious balance can result in disastrous results. Our mission is to enhance not destroy the local environment. Whilst each country has its own list, NON of our flowers are classified as invasive species in the US, Canada and Europe. \nUNITED STATES: https://www.invasivespeciesinfo.gov/plants/main.shtml \nCANADA: http://www.rbg.ca/archive/cbcn/en/projects/invasives/i_list.html\nEUROPE: https://www.eppo.int/INVASIVE_PLANTS/ias_lists.htm#IAPList\nBotanical names of our flowers:\nGeraldton Wax CHAMELAUCIUM uncinatum\nBottle BrushCALLISTEMON glaucus \nBlue Rottenest Island Daisy TRACHYMENE coerulea\nSturt's Desert Pea SWAINSONA formosa\nWattle ACACIA drummondii\nKangaroo Paw ANIGOZANTHOS flavidus \nNOTE: We don't recommend purchasing our seeds for delivery to New Zealand due to their strict quarantine requirements.\nSTRECH GOALS\n...................\nI'm happy to say we have reached both our stretch goals which means we can introduce three new seeds to our original range of six!\nFirst up is Billy Button!!!\nAvailable as a Combo 'Stretch goal -add on' reward and as part of the 'Multi gift pack' rewards\nAs part of the second stretch goal we are thrilled to introduce a new reward...Bush Fruits and Spice Seeds! Quandong and Old Man Salt Bush :)\nCurious as to how these taste? We've got a tasting rewards lined up as well. Receive these beautifully packaged native bush spices for tasting.\nFirst up is ground Quandong fruit: Funny name, delicious flavour! These sweet, glossy fruits, also known as \u2018wild peaches\u2019, are packed with vitamin C, protein, complex oils, iron and zinc. While you can eat them straight off the tree, our dried ground quandongs are great to add to cakes, juices and fruit salads or with fish and Asian food.\nAnd Old Man Salt Bush Milled leaf: Old man saltbush is salty! Many different varieties exist across arid regions of Australia. Traditionally used by indigenous Australians in dampers, this spices is great as a general spice and amazing with roasted potatoes. Contains 15g.

This 10\u201d track is sewn into the back of the belt to create over 40+ size positions to adjust with. This means you can adjust your Ultimate belt in \u00bc\u201d increments and achieve the perfect fit. So whether you just ate a big meal, or just started that new diet - your Ultimate belt is going to provide the perfect fit, every time. It's like a giant zip tie for your waist - only more fun to use. As a matter of fact, once you wear an Ultimate belt \u2013 you\u2019ll never want to go back to a traditional belt. To release or adjust the belt, just pinch the small tab under the buckle.   \n        After the campaign visit us @ http://www.KoreEssentials.com\nUltimate Belts (1.5\" wide) are constructed using 3 key elements. First, the exterior is a handsome nylon webbing test rated to over 500 lbs. Inside is a poly-urethane core center for added strength and stability to support gear, and yet flexible enough for comfort. On the inside is Super Fiber, a hybrid material that's both extremely durable and water resistant. These 3 elements combined make this the toughest belt you'll ever own and the last belt you'll ever need. \nUltimate buckles and nylon belts are interchangeable with ALL our other EDC (1.5\" wide) belts and buckles featured on our website.  \n\n                 See >>  http://www.KoreEssentials.com    \n                   After the campaign visit us @ http://www.KoreEssentials.com\nGet Cash Back on the Projects You Love!\n  At Kore Essentials creating innovative, quality products for men is what we do. Actually - it's ALL we do - it's our occupation. So we take it seriously and in doing so, strive to improve whenever possible. These unique, reinforced poly-core belts (1.5\u201d wide) are constructed using top-grade nylon webbing. The back of the belt is a Super-Fiber that's tough and water resistant. The buckles (2.25\u201d x 1.5\u201d) are a high-quality zinc alloy with a hardened gunmetal color finish. As always our products include a 30 day full money back guarantee and 1 year replacement warranty.  \nX3 Buckle & Black Reinforced Nylon Belt\n           After the campaign visit us @ http://www.KoreEssentials.com\nUltimate belt comes in \u201cOne-Size\u201d that fits any waist from 24\u201d up to 54\u201d. When you receive your new belt, turn it over and locate your Pant Size using the printed ruler marks. Then add 4 inches and cut using sharp scissors. So for example, if your pant size is 36\" - cut your belt at the 40\" mark. Then snap the cut end into the buckle receptacle (teeth) and put it on.  If it's still too big - you can trim off more, an inch at a time. It's liberating to be able to adjust your belt up to 5 inches in either direction \u2013 in or out - in tiny \u00bc\u201d increments.  \n                     \"This is the best fitting belt you\u2019ll ever own.\"  \n   < Backer Comments From Our Previous Kickstarter Projects >\n\u201cI love my Trakline belt! I show it off to everyone. Great product, so glad I became a backer!\u201d - Mike Goodridge\n\n\u201cHave to say the Trakline belt is the best Kickstarter item I have backed so far. The quality is great and is now my favourite belt!\u201d - Thurstan Johnstan\n\n\u201cGot my two belts and buckles and they're amazing. The quality is top-notch.\u201d - Casus Belli\n\n\u201cI love the belt and the quality in manufacturing and design is evident in everything.\u201d - Scott Burns\n\n\u201cSeriously, I can't get over how much I love this belt. I totally forget I'm wearing it because it's so comfortable.\u201d - Thomas Ella \nDespite our success, we\u2019re still a small company and launching a new product requires a lot of resources and funds up front. This means we need your support to help pay for tooling and enough starting inventory to keep the costs down. In return, we\u2019d love to give you one of these awesome new belts, or several if you like. Either way \u2013 we promise you\u2019re going to love it.  \nX2 Buckle & Tan Reinforced Nylon Belt\n   Once the Kickstarter campaign is funded, we will send out surveys to all backers to gather reward choices (buckle styles, leather colors, etc.) and shipping address. Once we get the surveys back we\u2019ll commence production. Based on the factories estimate, this process should take about 30-40 days to complete dependent on volume. We're going to make the belts at a responsible factory in China that we've done a lot of business with. One of our partners (Mauro) will personally be on hand to oversee and ensure that the best quality standards are met. Once the production is completed, we will ship the belts to our warehouse in San Diego, California (2 weeks) and then repackage individual orders to ship out to backers (1 week). So all in all, you should get your belt about 60-70 days after the campaign ends.  \n          After the campaign visit us @ http://www.KoreEssentials.com\nX3 Buckle & Tan Reinforced Nylon Belt\n   A number of years ago my wife bought me an expensive belt for my birthday. Unfortunately, my waist was \u201cin-between\u201d the belt holes at the time. We\u2019ve all been there. This time I boldly decided to poke a few holes of my own in the leather and \u201cfix it\u201d myself. Bad idea. I completely ruined the belt. I learned several key lessons that day. First \u2013 belt holes are bad. Second, never puncture a gift from your wife. It never turns out well. The good news - it set us out on a journey to create a better belt for men.  \nOur original Kickstarter Trakline belt campaign from 2013\nFlash forward - after 18 months of designing, prototyping and testing we launched our first evolution of Trakline belts right here on Kickstarter in 2013. We were fortunate enough to attract over 4,000 backers and were on our way. So here we are\u2026 back again to introduce our latest incarnation our new Ultimate belt.  \nX1 Buckle & Tan Reinforced Nylon Belt\n  Karl Kozak: Sales & Marketing\nMauro Bove: Manufacturing & Quality Control\nSteve Olson: Product & Web Design \n\nThe three of us have been friends and business partners for over 13 years now. Here's a little of our background and relevant history. For the past 15 years Mauro has been in product manufacturing and quality control. As a result, he's manufactured a wide variety of high-quality retail products for some of America\u2019s biggest retailers. Steve on the other hand, is an all-around talented designer, who's been crucial in creating our product designs, drawings and the website. My background has been in business management and sales. Over the past several decades, I've successfully launched, grown, managed and sold several companies. Together, the three of us make a great, motivated team that\u2019s focused on creating and marketing great products.  \nOur Pledge Management Partner\n  X1 Buckle & Black Reinforced Nylon Belt\n As of 2017 we have a total of 5 patents on our unique Trakline ratchet belts including one on a ratchet belt system with reinforced belt core to support gear. Why all the patents ? We\u2019ve spent a lot of time and money perfecting our proprietary technology and we'd like to keep it that way. \n   \n               Visit us online @  http://www.KoreEssentials.com \nGet Your Project Funded Today!\n                                THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME & SUPPORT \n           After the campaign visit us @ http://www.KoreEssentials.com\nX1 Buckle & Black Reinforced Nylon Belt\n   X1 Buckle & Tan Reinforced Nylon Belt\n   X2 Buckle & Black Reinforced Nylon Belt\n   X2 Buckle & Tan Reinforced Nylon Belt\n   X3 Buckle & Black Reinforced Nylon Belt\n   X3 Buckle & Tan Reinforced Nylon Belt\n       After the campaign visit us @ http://www.KoreEssentials.com\n\u00a9 Copyright 2017 Kore Essentials, Inc.

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 7th Kickstarter campaign since we launched our original Trakline belt project back in 2013. Since that time we've managed to launch and successfully deliver 6 new products to over 15,000 backers. And I think we can say with some certainty, that we met, or exceeded, most backers expectations in regards to product quality, design and function. \n\nOf course, along the way we've learned a few valuable lessons. \n\nFor example, we make a habit of communicating frequently and openly with our backers regarding the manufacturing progress and shipping status. We do an update every 1-2 weeks after the project is completed. \n\nGoal # 1 is to deliver a well designed, quality product that exceeds Backer expectations and that backers love. As proof with past campaigns - after receiving their Trakline belts over 40% of the backers visited our online store to purchase a 2nd, 3rd and 4th belt .\n\nNevertheless, we understand moving forward this is a new project, with its own set of challenges and that past successes don't eliminate all the future risks involved.\n\nThe biggest challenge as always for us when creating a new product, is timing. We strive to get our projects completed on time, with no snafus. There are molds and tooling to create and we test at each step of the process. But if delays do happen, we keep backers \"in the loop\" as to what's going on and the new timelines. \n\nBased on our track record - we feel like backers can be confident and assured - they're going to get a great product.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 49 or more", "title": "EARLYBIRD >> 1 Ultimate Belt", "descp": "Includes 1 Buckle & 1 Belt.

We\u2019ve alleviated this problem by creating a compression bag that keeps clothes compact, organized, and folded.  Acteon bags maximize space because they use a separate compression zipper to flatten that bulky stack of clothes.\nThe struggle of keeping clean and dirty clothes separate disappears when using our packing cubes.  We engineered a gusseted divider between compartments that keeps clean clothes fresh by isolating them from worn smelly clothes.  This works pretty simply.  Start out your trip with all of your clothing on the clean side.  As your clothes get dirty, you move them one by one to the dirty side to keep them separated.  The expandable center divider transfers space from the clean side to the dirty side while not increasing the overall size of the packing cube.  In storing clothes separately, you can easily travel to multiple locations without worry. This also greatly simplifies unpacking.\nHow to use the Clean and Dirty Compartments\nPLAY\n\n  Without a compression cube, your clothes are going to shift and move during travel. This means you'll be left with a scattered and crumpled mess.  By using an Acteon bag, your clothes will remain in their space and have a better possibility of staying wrinkle free.\nHow to Pack and Compress a Cube\nPLAY\n\nPacking List: 7 mens medium t-shirts, 1 pair of shorts and 1 pair of 32x32 jeans.\n  Inspired by travel and the thrills of excursions, we created designs with geometric patterns that will appeal to anyone.  To keep organization easy and show that compression is key, we used colored zippers to easily differentiate where to place your clothes, and when it\u2019s time to compress.\nUltra Lightweight: 4.2oz (120g) Large and 3.0oz (86g) Small\nUltra Compact\nDurable Silicone Coated Ripstop Nylon Construction\nWater Resistant\nYKK Zippers\nSeparate Clean/Dirty Compartments\nNylon Webbing Carry Handle\nCompression Zippers to save even more space\nCorded Zipper Pulls\nSilicone Coated Ripstop Nylon is Water Resistant and Extremely Durable\n                  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBringing a product from the drawing board to reality is not an easy task.

An endless maze of mobile apps, smart switches, and other interfaces create a confusing and fragmented experience.\nWe believe there's a better way - Knocki offers the simplest, most natural, and accessible way to control the world around you.  You've never seen anything like it!\nThe Buzz\n    Meet Knocki\nKnocki is a small wireless device that instantly transforms ordinary surfaces (walls, tables, doors, furniture, countertops, & more) into powerful yet easy to access remotes for your favorite devices and software.\n  The Basics\nUsing Knocki is easy.  Just tap simple gestures anywhere on a Knocki-enabled surface to automate all kinds of useful actions.  Make your ordinary surroundings do more.\nWhy reach for a phone, a remote, or a switch to perform your favorite functions? There's another control interface that's always within reach - the world around you, and you can activate it with Knocki.\nCan your table turn on a TV or dim the lights?  With Knocki discreetly mounted underneath, the entire surface becomes capable and connected.  Knocki adds magical simplicity wherever you use it.\n  A Few of the Many Use Cases\n    Who is Knocki for?\nKnocki isn't just for people with smart homes or high-tech offices.  Knocki works well anywhere with a WiFi internet connection.  It allows you to \"tap\" into many powerful functions, even if your only smart device is an iPhone or Android phone.\nKnocki is the easiest way to add \"smarts\" to your existing home, without the wiring, installation, complexity and expense of many alternative smart home control systems. \nBut if you already have a few smart devices, you can immediately expand what Knocki can do, and transform \"dumb\" surfaces all around your home or office into intelligent interfaces.\nBottom line, if you'd like technology to work for you, instead of the other way around, you'll appreciate the power of Knocki!\nYou can put Knocki on, under, or behind surfaces anywhere!\nAttach Knocki on walls, under tables, behind shelves or nightstands, behind your front door, and more!  Knocki can be placed in plain sight, or mounted invisibly under or behind surfaces so only you know its there.\nEach Knocki includes a special mount featuring our patent-pending SurfaceLink\u2122 technology to ensure a solid connection to a surface for transmission of gesture signals.  Knocki's mount can be secured using the included 3M removable tape, or with screws (also included).\n  Setup is Easy!\nSetting up your Knocki is easy and just takes a few minutes. Start by connecting Knocki to your WiFi network and use the free Knocki companion app to link all your devices and accounts. \nAfter Knocki is mounted to a surface,  define the unique gestures to trigger your actions (up to 10 gestures), and you've instantly created a powerful smart surface!  The process is simple, and once it's done, Knocki will keep working (via WiFi) even if your phone is turned off or away!\nWith Knocki installed on a surface, the surface instantly becomes a powerful and programmable remote control, even many feet away from where Knocki is attached.\nKnocki uses non-acoustic sensor technology to detect gentle surface gestures even a distance away, but Knocki also has the intelligence to filter out random vibrations.  Therefore, Knocki works under busy breakfast tables and other \"high-activity\" surfaces.\nGently Tap or Knock\nKnocki reliably identifies simple gestures defined by taps or knocks on a surface. Gestures can be defined by a quantity (two, three, four, or more taps), or even by more complex patterns (two taps + three taps) for more secure functions.\nFor example, a double tap can be set to turn on a light, and a more elaborate sequence (two triple taps followed by a double tap) can be used to unlock a smart lock.\nOne Knocki can store up to 10 unique gestures, turning any surface into a remote control with many functions.  \nA gesture can trigger a single action (e.g. \"find phone\"), or a set of actions (e.g. \"door locked\" + \"lights off\" + \"home security armed\").\nOur Patent-Pending Technology\nKnocki's performance is made possible by our suite of patent-pending technology and sophisticated software & hardware algorithms:\nKnocki deciphers deliberate taps and knocks from random vibrations in the environment to minimize false positives. \nKnocki uses non-acoustic sensor technology that is NOT triggered by or affected by sound. Thus, multiple Knockis can coexist in the same room without conflict (as long as they are on separate surfaces).  For example, you can setup one Knocki behind your nightstand, and another behind the nightstand of your partner! \nAdvanced power-budgeting delivers over 12 months of battery life using AAA batteries. (Please always use mercury free batteries, or better yet, rechargeable batteries!  We like this planet). \nSome of the Platforms Knocki Supports:\nWe're constantly adding integrations with new smart home platforms, devices, and software. Our commitment is to make Knocki more capable over time, and connected to the leading technology of tomorrow.\nKnocki's capabilities will continue to expand as we add new partners, update the mobile app, and even push out OTA hardware updates.\n  What About Voice Control?\nVoice control is everywhere. Services like Apple\u2019s Siri and Amazon\u2019s Alexa can simplify tasks, but often don\u2019t work as expected.\nHere are a few of the problems:\nBackground sounds:  Music or a TV playing in the background can render voice-control useless. Knocki uses non-acoustic sensors so it works just as well if you\u2019re jamming to music, watching the evening news, or if people are talking in the background.\nCan Disturb Others:  Voice control is problematic in quiet environments such as a shared office or in bedrooms where you don\u2019t want to disturb others. Knocki\u2019s advanced accelerometer technology responds to gentle taps that others won\u2019t hear.\nIt Often Misunderstands: Did you say \u201cwhere is Rome\u201d or \u201cnavigate home?\u201d Voice technology is finicky, especially with kids, elderly, and people with accents who might not enunciate in the required way. Knocki uses simple tap/knock gestures, and our patent-pending technology to perform reliably whether you tap fast, slow, hard, or soft.\nCan\u2019t use multiple voice controllers in the same space: Good luck putting a voice controller on your nightstand, and then another one on your partner\u2019s nightstand. You\u2019ll have both controllers responding simultaneously creating smart home chaos. Knocki recognizes gestures on a specific surface so you can have multiple Knockis in the same room or other space without conflict. Knocki allows you to personalize controls to the surfaces near you.\n  What about Smart Switches and Buttons?\nSmart buttons and switches can also automate tasks, but they have a few \u201cpressing\u201d problems.\nDon\u2019t blend in: Wall switches and buttons aren\u2019t so pretty to look at. Knocki can be placed under or behind surfaces, so you don\u2019t even have to see it to use it. But if you do mount it within view, it blends beautifully with your surfaces.\nMust be pressed or flipped: Physical buttons and switches must be within physical reach in order to be used. Knocki turns an entire surface into a remote control, so you can trigger actions from anywhere, without needing to visually or physically locate a specific spot. (Also great for kids, physically impaired, and elderly who can\u2019t reach a switch).\nNot as reliable or responsive: Most buttons rely on Bluetooth, so they require a phone to be turned on, paired to the button, and within range in order to function. Unlike smart buttons, Knocki uses WiFi to trigger actions directly, without going through a phone. This allows Knocki to work instantly without the lag of bluetooth, and even if your phone is off.\nLimited functionality: Many smart switches/buttons only perform a single on/off function, or are limited to only a few press patterns. Knocki can provide quick and easy control of a few functions for most users, but power users can go wild with up to 10 gestures per Knocki-enabled surface, allowing their entire tables, walls, furniture and other surfaces to control thousands of devices via IFTTT, SmartThings, Wemo, and more!\n  Beautiful Inside & Out\nHere's what you get with each unit ordered:\nKnocki: Made in the USA.\nSurface Mount: Featuring our SurfaceLink\u2122 technology, the mount helps transfer gesture signals from the surface to Knocki.\n3M Tape: Working directly with 3M, we've customized and tested a secure yet removable adhesive to avoid damaging surfaces.\nAAA Duracell Batteries: Mercury-free Duracell alkaline batteries provide over 12 months of battery life.\nOur Free Companion App (iOS & Android): Only necessary for device setup. The app allows you to easily connect Knocki to your WiFi and quickly add up to 10 gestures per Knocki device. You can manage multiple Knockis from one account.  The app also allows you to monitor battery life, connectivity status, and view activity logs.\nQuick Setup Guide: Get up and running in no time!\nMaking an Impact\nKnocki can make a difference in anyone's life. However, it can be truly life-changing for people with mobility or vision impairments who are unable to reach or visually locate a switch, button, or phone. Knocki also improves accessibility for children and the elderly. \n  Rewards\nWe are thankful, honored, and humbled by the overwhelming response by our backers. Your support enables us to reach the numbers required to place our first production order at a reduced cost per unit.  It also helps us maintain our company's growth and expand our team.  \nUpdate: In order to help get Knocki out to as many people as possible, we've decided to extend our popular Super Early Bird rate for a limited period of time.\nAfter the Super Early Bird rate runs out, you'll still be able get Knocki at the higher Early Bird rate (which is also discounted), but it's worthwhile to get the Super Early Bird while you still can.\nStretch Goals   \nThe response from backers around the world to our campaign has been absolutely amazing. Your feedback and suggestions have helped us introduce new features and options you'll love!  \nStretch Goal #1: HTTP Requests & Sonos Integration  \nThis highly popular stretch goal is officially UNLOCKED!\nStretch Goal #2: Knocki Black Edition  \nBlack Edition is UNLOCKED!  \nWhile our standard Knocki is designed to look gorgeous on walls and blend well with many other surfaces, Knocki Black Edition offers a stealthier style when mounted underneath tables or behind furniture, and also complements a wide variety of surfaces.\n How to Request Black Edition (instead of the standard design):  \nBy default, all pledges are for the standard design. However, after the Kickstarter campaign is over, you'll have the option to choose whether to keep the standard design, or swap your whole order for the Black Edition. There's no additional cost to swap.  \nHow to Get Both Versions: Standard AND Black Edition:  \nStart by selecting a pledge-level for the number of Knockis you'd like with the standard design. When calculating your pledge amount total, add an additional $79 for each Black Edition you want to add. If you select a multi-pack pledge, add another $69 for each Black Edition Knocki!\nStretch Goal #3: Open API\nOur open API stretch goal is UNLOCKED! \nOur Timeline\n  Our Story\nCo-founders Jake & Ohad have been friends for years, but their \"aha moment\" happened more recently over a family get-together.  They were watching one of their small children stacking up boxes to reach a light switch.  That observation led them to ask a simple question, \"Why not turn walls and other common surfaces into control interfaces?\" \nThat was the spark that set them on their path to develop Knocki, and this Kickstarter campaign marks an exciting milestone. Building a successful company, growing a talented team, and developing an amazing product is full of hard work and perseverance, and we thank you for supporting us as we bring Knocki to the world!\n  We Couldn't Do It Alone\nOur growing team has been working hard over the past year to develop Knocki, but we couldn't have done it without the support of others!\n  Our Team\nTalent, hard work, and a great idea are a recipe for success, and our team has all three.  If there's one thing our team could use a little more of, it's sleep!  Thanks to everyone on our team for the amazing work and dedication.\n     What People Think\nPLAY\n\n     A Special Thanks\nWe'd like to give a very special thanks to Poetic Systems, for helping us develop a scalable, secure, and delightful user experience.   We'd also like to thank Film Lab Creative for creating a beautiful video!\n     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nKnocki isn't some far-fetched idea hacked together in a garage.

You lay everything out on the counter and reach for a knife - your favorite knife. The one that\u2019s dirty, but you stop to clean it anyway. The knife that makes you a more confident and creative cook. The right knife.\nWe\u2019ve made that knife. By combining the very best of eastern and western knifemaking, we\u2019ve created an incredibly sharp, beautiful, premium blade - and we\u2019re bringing it to you for a non-premium price.\nThe right blade\nYour chef knife is central to creating nearly every dish. Whether you\u2019re mincing chives, or cutting apart a whole chicken, the chef knife can do it all.\nHowever, your choices at the store are confusing. Cheap knives are clunky to use and dull quickly. Even if you're willing to spend more, unfamiliar features and a wide spectrum of prices can make the options overwhelming. Finding the right blade can be a frustrating experience, but we don\u2019t think that needs to be the case.\n An incredible knife for a fair price \nThe world of chef knives is out of date. The big knife brands are operating on outdated sales margins that inflate the price of knives sold at a retail store. By avoiding the traditional retail sales model and bringing our product to you directly online, we have created a great knife for a fraction of the price.\nDon\u2019t waste your money on a knife block filled with knives you\u2019ll never use. Get the one knife you\u2019ll reach for again and again.\nComparison of the costs that go into bringing you a knife\nOne great blade\nA good knife stays sharp and is comfortable to use. A great knife is the one you reach for.\nWe\u2019ve put a ton of attention into how people hold and use their knives, and we think we\u2019ve designed the ultimate hybrid. A knife that takes the best elements of western and eastern knifemaking, and combines them into one blade.\nAfter experimenting with dozens of blade profiles, grip shapes and types of steel, we\u2019ve created an incredibly sharp blade that feels right at home in your hand. A long deep belly helps with effortless chopping, while the lowered tip makes slicing and finer work more approachable.\n  Grip & Bolster \nThe grip and bolster are designed with intention. The contour of the grip makes it feel secure regardless of your preferred grip style or the the size of your hands. Olive Wood - a durable hardwood - keeps the handle grippy whether it's wet or dry.\nEven when holding the blade in a pinch grip, a thumb groove in the bolster makes for a more confident and comfortable grip on the blade.\nA well balanced blade.\n Layered Steel\nThe vast majority of stainless steel blades are made with soft steel that won\u2019t hold an edge. Our blade has a cutting core made of Japanese VG-10 steel. This innovative high-carbon stainless steel holds an incredible edge and won\u2019t corrode like other high carbon steels.\nThis cutting core is then sandwiched in 66 layers of alternating stainless steels. This technique - sometimes referred to as \u201cSan Mai\u201d which is used in traditional Japanese sword making - allows the VG10 to be used for the edge while the other layers form a jacket around it. This layering protects the cutting core, while providing a beautiful layered finish on the faces of the blade.\nHow sharp? Very sharp. \nMany knives on the market are sharp, but few stay that way for long. Being as sharp as possible isn\u2019t necessarily best, particularly if you\u2019re trading off the knife\u2019s ability to retain that sharp edge. A scalpel may be sharper than a kitchen knife, but it would dull quickly.\nIf your steel is too hard it becomes brittle, and if your edge angle is too fine it will dull quickly. We experimented until we found the right steel and edge profile that maximizes edge retention. The result is a blade that\u2019s razor sharp and stays that way.\nOur steel is hardened to between 57-59 rockwell hardness, which allows for a more finely sharpened edge. The blade is then tapered to a 17 degree edge angle, allowing you to glide through even the toughest of root vegetables.\n  Testing\u2026 Testing... \nWe\u2019ve tested our blade with both chefs and home cooks to develop something that feels intuitive for everyone. After more than a year of designing, prototyping, testing, and manufacturing samples we\u2019re ready to go to production. Dozens of revisions have helped us to develop a knife we can\u2019t wait to share with the world.\nStretch Goals\nCustom textured ABS Blade Guard.
