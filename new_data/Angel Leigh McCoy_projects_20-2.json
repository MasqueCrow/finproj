[{"backer": "Angel Leigh McCoy", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "The Children of Eriu is a Celtic role-playing-game (RPG) set in the Fate of the Norns universe. What if you're not a gamer, but still love Celtic history and mythology? Scroll down to the Celtic Cyclopedia! Want a devotional card deck of the Celtic gods? Scroll down to the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann tarot cards!\nEvery aspect of the history, culture and lore has been painstakingly researched, to present you with a very authentic and accurate portrayal of the Celtic kingdoms. Over 2 years of development has already been invested into this project, including design, writing and artwork. What does this mean to you? The books will be released in early 2020.\nThe world within the Children of Eriu mixes many cultures: The Celtic Kingdoms, the encroaching Christian dominions, and the invading Vikings.\nWorld Map\nAbove is a zoomed map region of a much larger Fate of the Norns universe. The adventures in the Children of Eriu span this region along with the Otherworld of the faeries and gods.\nThe Children of Eriu (probably 450 pages) book includes everything in the Celtic Cyclopedia (estimated 150-200 pages). The encyclopedia includes the lore, history, and myth, but omits all game materials. Both books are filled with glorious maps and beautiful artwork. The tarot deck of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann can be your main pledge level, or added as a pledge ad-on (see Add-Ons down below).\nIf you're a gamer, The Children of Eriu is for you!  \n This RPG is set in the Fate of the Norns universe, based on a historical and mythological world similar to our own. The game focuses on the 10th century, but there's lore for games to be set anywhere between the 7th and 10th century.\nThe players take up the mantle of heroes in a land struggling to find its identity. The 6 kingdoms, while all considered Celtic, have very distinct cultures. Mixed into the pagan beliefs are the revolutionary teachings of the White God, whose abbeys and monasteries have sprung up throughout the land. To this is added the daily threat of Viking invaders who seek to plunder and subjugate the Children of Eriu.\nPlayer characters will have lifepaths that create complex and nuanced backgrounds, sparking interesting, conflicting, and emotional choices. The game introduces emotional conditions, adding a new layer of depth to player characters, and those conditions mechanically impact game-play. The game also introduces social combat mechanics, making a scene more interesting and flavorful than a reductionist single charisma check.\nThe RPG uses the runic game system and will be the first book with the brand new 3.0 rules. RGS 3 streamlines play with unified mechanics, speeding up combat and providing players with meaningful choices. By replacing dice with runes, your game is less about \"did the dice let me do it?\" and becomes \"what do I want to do? and how do I want to do it\". The game system also has 3 levels of crunch, where each player can play at the complexity level they enjoy, sharing in the same experience. To play the game, you can download the Fate of the Norns app (iOS and Android) or play with physical Futhark runes. A single set of 24 runes can accommodate up to 4 low level players, if you have more players, then 2 sets would be recommended (see Add-Ons down below).\nThe Children of Eriu is a stand alone RPG, having its own rules, and doesn't require the Fate of the Norns: Ragnarok core rulebook to play. After this project is delivered, we will be providing a free PDF of how to merge these two games together, since they are designed to be compatible with one another. \n If you're a lover of Celtic culture, history and mythology, then the Celtic Cyclopedia is for you!\nThe Celtic Cyclopedia delves deeply into the 6 Celtic kingdoms, detailing dozens of kings, queens, and heroes. The book explores the religions, cultures and mythology of the Celtic tribes. It also presents many exotic creatures from epics and fairy-tales. If you're not a gamer, and want a beautifully illustrated book on a subject you hold dear to your heart, then the Celtic Cyclopedia is for you!\n If you're an art collector, practice heathenry or simply collect different tarot decks, then the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann tarot deck is for you.\nThis deck of cards beautifully illustrates the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann, gods of the ancient Celtic peoples. The deck also has illustrated cards for sacred places and creatures from the fairy-tales and myths.\n The deck will consist of 72 cards and include gods and goddesses such as Morrigan, Dagda, Lugh, Ogma, Manannan, Aonghas, Brigit, Epona, Beira, Donn, Crom Cruach, Cernunnos, etc...\n Are you a roleplayer? Are you curious about the mechanics? Keep reading!\nFirst question might be, what's the production value going to look like? Our answer is a full colour fully illustrated coffee table book experience. Take a look at one of our previous books: \nSo how does it play you may ask... What? No dice?! Yup, the game uses runes and for a good reason. A great RPG story is not dictated by a success or failure, but rather what the heroes and villains do, and how they do it. The Runic-Game-System is an action-reaction paradigm: you choose what you do and then others can use their actions to change your action's outcome.\nAre you curious about the RGS game mechanics? We don't have an updated RGS 3 video or PDF as yet, but this webpage will be a good primer:\nRGS-How-To-Play\nIt's a very simple game to learn and teach. At gaming conventions, players learn how to play in less than 5 minutes. RGS is even more streamlined with this brand new 3rd edition.\nRGS runs on 24 symbols categorized into 3 colours. While the Fate of the Norns universe uses the Elder Futhark runes, there no reason why you couldn't adapt this using Celtic oghams. Perhaps a future stretch goal might make this a reality?\nThe Children of Eriu presents the players with a choice between 5 very unique archetypes. Each archetype has 3 specializations allowing each character to really play in their preferred style.\nThe bestiary chapter is filled with more than 40 unique creatures drawn from Celtic fairy-tales and mythology- each beautifully illustrated.\nWant to know more? You can google our many websites, forums, reviews, etc... We've been around commercially since 2012, but the first RPG manuscript was written back in 1993.\nFulfillment will be done in 2 different ways. If you simply want a book or a deck of cards and nothing else, your best options are the print-on-demand (POD) tiers. However if you're looking to supplement your book and cards with more books and more cards and runes and maps and art, well, the bundles are the way to go. You can add any of the following add-ons to BUNDLE level pledges. All prices are in Canadian dollars (CAD).\nYou can add the following to be shipped to you (which will increase existing shipping costs):\n+$65 for a print copy of the Celtic Cyclopedia\n+$105 for a print copy of the Children of Eriu\n+$40 Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann tarot deck\n+$30 CAD for any digital book PDF\n+$30 Wooden Elder Futhark rune set\n+$60 Stainless steel Futhark rune set\n+$20 A set of laminated playmats\n+$30 An art print of the world map\n+$90 for a copy of Core Rulebook or Denizens of the North or Lords of the Ash\n+$100 for a copy of the Illuminated Edda\n+$70 for a copy of Vanagard\n+$120 A linen tapestry of the world map\n+$15 GM screen (available with the $33k stretch goal)\nMore to be announced...\nIf you're on the POD pledge level and want an extra that's also a POD pledge level, just make a pledge for one of them and increase your pledge total by the cost of the other one.\nSurveys will be handled with our partner PledgeManager. Their system will walk  you through add-ons, shipping, etc\nWe have some tremendous artisans working with us. This section will  showcase the quality of what you will receive.\nWhich will you choose? Will you take up wood or metal runes in your unending quest for the glory of Eriu?\nThis deerskin map is one of a kind and is limited to a single pledge level (The Children of Eriu bundle). It is hand-burned onto a traditional buckskin piece using a pyrography iron. This creates an incredible 3-D effect. After that the map is painted with natural pigments using a piece of bone, and other strips of leather are added for locations and names. This is a one of a kind treasure was created by Kfir of Cave Geek Art!\nAsk if you'd like to see more closeup shots of any of the products and we'll upload them into this section.\nMeet the Creative team! \nThe eloquent authors of the book are Matthieu Boone and Tyler Omichinski. Tyler provided the Celtic inspired immortals for the Ennie Award nominated \"Hudson & Brand\", has written a Guide to Celts for Savage Worlds, and is the lead writer on the forthcoming The Wild Hunt for Call of Cthulhu.\nThe RGS 3 rules are designed and written by Andrew Valkauskas, the creator of the Fate of the Norns universe and author of the Illuminated Edda.\nOur very talented artists are Julliane Novikova, Sveta Ignatova, Soni Alcorn Hender, Kfir Mendel and Melanie Steinke. Julliane, Sveta and Soni's wondrous works appear in previous Fate of the Norns books and games.\nThe uncompromising layout will be delivered by James Kerr, author of 2 Fate of the Norns adventures.\nOur typo hunter and editor extraordinaire is Erik Growen.\n * The above EARLY BIRD perks are additive, so first 25 backers get rune upgrade, free tarot deck and the bookmark.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe manuscript is complete, and this kickstarter is helping to pay for artwork, editing and layout.

At your doorstep. In the shadows, something stirs. Strange beings. Twisted creatures, lurking at the edge of vision. Watching. Waiting. Unseen by most, but not by you. You see them for what they really are.\nVaesen.\nVaesen - Nordic Horror Roleplaying is a brand new RPG line from Free League Publishing. Written by award-winning author Nils Hintze (Tales From the Loop RPG) and based on the work of Swedish illustrator and author Johan Egerkrans, Vaesen presents a dark Gothic setting steeped in Nordic folklore and old myths of Scandinavia. The game mechanics use an adapted version of the award-winning Year Zero Engine.\nSwedish: Rollspelet Vaesen kommer sj\u00e4lvklart \u00e4ven att publiceras p\u00e5 svenska, med namnet Nordiska v\u00e4sen. Du kan v\u00e4lja vilket spr\u00e5k du vill ha i en pledge manager efter avslutad kampanj.\nWe are raising funds to produce a lavishly illustrated and beautifully produced book with more than 200 pages of content. This core rulebook will contain all you need to roleplay in the Mythic North: rules, setting and an introductory scenario. The book will be printed on premium paper and will be in the US Letter format. The text is written, translation and layout is well underway. We need the funding to complete the layout, and print and ship the book. Shipping will be added later and handled in the pledge manager after the kickstarter concludes, read more under the headline Shipping at the bottom of this page. \nYou can see sample spreads from the book below.\nIf we exceed our base funding goal, we will unlock physical stretch goals that include a big full-color map of the Mythic North, a GM Screen, and custom dice designed specifically for the game.\nYou can see the standard edition of the book cover at the top of the page. A limited edition with cloth covers and gold foil details, included in the LINDWORM reward and above, is shown below.\nWelcome to the Mythic North \u2013 northern Europe of the nineteenth century, but not as we know it today. A land where the myths are real. A cold reach covered by vast forests, its few cities lonely beacons of industry and enlightenment \u2013 a new civilization dawning. But in the countryside, the old ways still hold sway. There, people know what lurks in the dark.\nThey know to fear it.\nThe dark forests, deep lakes and vast mountain ranges of Scandinavia are home to a multitude of supernatural beings. They are known as the little people, the invisibles, or simply the fair folk. When someone vanishes in the woods, when the milk curdles over night, when strange noises are heard in the loft or when an unexplained ailment strikes, it is said to be the work of such entities.\nSome of these creatures appear all over Europe: ghosts, giants, dragons, trolls, werewolves and faeries. Others are endemic to Scandinavia, such as the Neck who rules the rivers, the Huldra who guards the forest, tomtar, mylings and many others.\nYou and your companions in the Society were born different. You have the Sight - the ability to see what ordinary people cannot. You know that vaesen have lived beside humanity for untold centuries,  in an uneasy peace. Not anymore. Rumors spread of kittens born with two heads, streams red from blood, groves lulling children into eternal sleep, fairies dancing through villages, luring the young into the woods to be forever enthralled.\nEmbarking on journeys to remote villages in the wilderness, you will uncover the secrets of the Mythic North. Armed with nothing but your courage, conviction, and ability to see the supernatural, you will face the creatures of the forest. Neither bullets nor blades can stop them. To drive them off, you must understand them. Find their weakness. \nYet even if you prevail, facing the vaesen will leave you with scars that never heal.\nThe game rules of Vaesen are based on the award-winning Year Zero Engine, also used in Tales From the Loop, Forbidden Lands, Mutant: Year Zero and the upcoming ALIEN RPG.\nThe core mechanic is straight-forward: To make a skill roll, you simply grab a number of dice for your attribute score, skill level and gear, and roll them all together. You need at least one six to succeed, and extra sixes can give you stunts and other bonus effects.\nIn Vaesen, you will find fast and flavorful rules for horror and the scars that will permanently change your player characters. Encountering vaesen will change you forever, in one way or another. In addition, there are fast rules for managing and developing your group's headquarter \u2013 Castle Gyllencreutz in the city of Upsala. Expand your library, build a laboratory or hire staff to help you. Together you will expand your abilities to confront and fight your enemies and solve mysteries.\nThe setting of Vaesen is called The Mythic North, loosely based on Scandinavia in the middle of the 19th century. A desolate area on the northernmost fringes of Europe, it is covered with vast forests broken by craggy hills and lonely mountains. It is a wild place, where a few developed cities in the south are the few beacons of civilization.\nIn the countryside, the old ways rule. Peasants work the land as they always have done, workers toil in the dark woods and on the mighty rivers, often paying the ultimate price while doing so. A few rail lines connect the important cities, otherwise you need to travel by horse, coach, or foot.\nThe Mythic North - Work in Progress by Tobias Tranell\nWe love friendly local gaming stores all over the world and want to forge an even closer relationship with you. We offer a retailer pledge, including five copies of Vaesen - Nordic Horror Roleplaying (including printed stretch goals), at a heavily discounted retailer price. You can complement your pledge with retailer addons, including the full range of our core RPG rulebooks, which you'll find in the Addons section below.\nBy taking part in this Kickstarter as a retailer, you make sure you get the games on time for launch and you get them at a lower cost than through normal distribution channels. As an added bonus, you get access to all updates and sneak peeks of Vaesen here on the Kickstarter.\nWe also offer FREE SHIPPING to retailers in the EU, UK and North America.\nFor more information about how we work with retailers, and to get early information about our upcoming releases, sign up to our monthly retailer newsletter!\nPlease note that retailer pledges are only available to actual retailers. You will be asked to present your company organization number when confirming your pledge in the pledge manager.\nFree League Publishing supports the Kickstarter workers' efforts to organize a union, and we encourage the Kickstarter management to support this effort as well. We have communicated our stance to Kickstarter management, and we are following the matter closely. Currently we do not believe in a boycott however, and this is also not something that the Kickstarter workers themselves recommend. However, should you prefer an alternative method to support this project, we offer the possibility to make a late pledge via Pledge Manager after the Kickstarter ends. To be notified when the late pledges open, sign up for our newsletter and we will drop you a line!\nWith your help, we can make Vaesen even more amazing. Below are the stretchgoals we have lined up if we exceed our initial funding goal.\nSTRETCHGOAL 1: HARDCOVER BOOK \u2013 UNLOCKED!\nWe will print the Vaesen book in top-quality hardback covers.\nSTRETCHGOAL 2: MAP OF THE MYTHIC NORTH \u2013 UNLOCKED!\nA double-sided full-color print of Tobias Tranell's magnificent map of The Mythic North. This physical stretch goal will be included in the TROLL reward level and above.\nSTRETCHGOAL 3: BONUS MYSTERY 1 \u2013 UNLOCKED!\nThe mystery \"A Grim Secret\" written by Gabrielle DeBourg. The player characters are tasked with investigating the disappearance of two visitors in a remote village deep in the vast forest. This digital stretch goal will be included in PDF format in the VAETTIR reward and above.\nSTRETCHGOAL 4: EXTRA ARCHETYPE: PRIVATE DETECTIVE \u2013 UNLOCKED!\nWe will add an eight playable archetype, the Private Detective.

Caroline set about to do something different, working over the past few years with Sarah to design a comfortable, sexy, luxurious mix and match lingerie collection that tackles different outcomes of surgery.\nA very special thank you to our beautiful models, Lisa, Gemma, Christina, Alice and Debbie who truly inspire us to keep doing what we are doing every day!\nThe first collection is a mixture of five soft bras, five briefs, a suspender belt and robe which can be mixed and matched. These have been thoughtfully designed with clever hidden support to suit the different outcomes of surgery and for a variety of needs; whether directly after surgery, returning to work, going out with friends or for a special occasion. Future collections will tackle more outcomes of surgery and expand our product range to swimwear and sportswear.  \nLoveRose, Love Yourself!\nHow you'll receive your beautiful lingerie- Sustainability is important to us, and this includes our packaging.

Players take the role of grizzled private detectives seeking a solution to a brutal crime.

Can you find the evidence to put her behind bars?\nNice bar you've got there... be a shame if anything happened to it!

This file is still a work in progress and subject to change.\nYour hardboiled detective visits Locations in New Orleans' three neighborhoods, tracking down clues, while trying to prevent other detectives from beating them to the punch. The first gumshoe to come up with a Suspect, Motive, and Evidence can make their accusation and solve the crime. \nCharacters visit the various Locations in New Orleans to search for clues.\nAt each Location you must overcome an encounter, ranging from simple obstacles to the Big Easy's most fearsome adversaries. The other detectives have the opportunity to meddle in your affairs and make life difficult for you. \nWhen I arrived at the scene, it was clear that there weren't going to be any clues left here.\nEach turn is broken into 5 phases which you complete before play passes to the next detective to the left.  \nAt the start of your turn, draw enough Gumshoe cards to fill your hand to its maximum hand size. Your hand size is six, unless modified by some other card.  \nIn the Legwork Phase you can play cards to equip your detective for the coming investigation, add Locations to the Neighborhoods in play, and play Legwork cards to give yourself an advantage later in the round.  \nLocations must be played adjacent to the neighborhood they belong to.\nEach detective can equip up to three equip cards, one of each type: Device, Weapon, and Getup.\nIn the Move Phase, your detective can travel between neighborhoods, or from one neighborhood to an attached Location at that same neighborhood. \nIt takes two moves for Jean to visit Congo Square: one to go Downtown, then on to his destination.\nWhen you arrive at a new destination, you reveal the top card of the encounter deck, and must face whatever challenge you find there in the Investigate Phase.   \nWalter arrives at the cemetery and must face an encounter with the Walkin' Dead!\nIn the Investigate Phase, if your detective overcame the encounter at the new location, he or she may Investigate the scene to reveal a clue. \nTo succeed, your detective must equal or beat the Target Number of the Location by discarding a card with sufficient Value. The card's base value is modified by each icon it has that matches those on the Location.    \nYou gain a +1 bonus for each matching icon.\nIf the gumshoe is successful, you draw a Clue card of the type shown on the Location card (a suspect, in the image above). The Clues you collect are added to your Case File alongside your character card.  \nAt the end of your turn, you must discard any cards in excess of your maximum hand size. You can choose to discard as many other cards as you want to. \nThe game continues until one player is able to collect one Suspect, one Motive, and one Evidence clue in their Case File. When you have the clues you need, you can make your accusation. Reveal the clues you are using to solve the case and describe how they fit together to resolve the mystery.   \nTony Marcello committed the crime in a fit of jealousy. Despite his claims that he was elsewhere on the night of the murder, you have found a picture of Marcello and the victim together on the night of the crime. Your watertight case wins the game!

Because we don't have the connections to distributors, stores are overwhelmed by new products right now, and most of all, to improve the quality of the components and add additional content to the game. Our goal is to make The Big Easy the best it can possibly be, and perhaps even create future expansions if you love it as much as we do! \nFirst, all backers at Gumshoe and Unusual Suspects will receive a print and play PDF version of the game.

Humankind has expanded into the universe. We have discovered not only wonders without, from the remains of ancient civilizations to a dizzying array of habitable worlds, but also wonders within: the inherent power of consciousness called psionics. Despite its expansions and advances, however, humankind remains ever at war, and in the far future those wars spread across the cosmos powered by billion year old weapons of mysterious origin.\nREVOLUTION by Eugene Marshall\nSet in France in 1789, on the eve of the French Revolution, Revolution features swashbuckling musketeers dueling in the streets, alchemists concocting strange compounds in their alchemical labs, and intellectuals, spies, and members of secretive, occult societies plotting and plying their revolutionary ideas in the salons of French aristocratic Paris, all while the heady draught of revolution brews across Europe.\nVIRULENT by Aaron Acevedo, Sean Bircher, Darrell Hardy, Eugene Marshall, Brain Reeves, and John Wick\nThis is a post apocalyptic setting of dark survival in a world ruled by three plagues: vampires, werewolves and zombies.

In addition, the physical catalog will receive fancy cover imprinting and edge printing.\n The RAINBOW ARCADE CATALOG will be the first comprehensive introduction to queer gaming history in print. It will contain and present the extensive research behind RAINBOW ARCADE, the world\u2019s first exhibition chronicling over 30 years of LGBTQIA* video games, their developers and players, opening on December 13, 2018 at Schwules Museum in Berlin, Germany.\nLike the exhibition itself, the catalog demonstrates how queerness has always been a part of video game culture. They are meant as an appraisal and a contribution to our ongoing conversations on diversity, representation, discrimination and politics in popular culture. This is why the catalog will not only include a detailed exhibition directory featuring all games shown from 1985 to 2018 and supplementary texts, but also additional essays by and interviews with developers, artists and researchers. We want as many people as possible to access our work even without having to visit the exhibition in Germany; therefore, our goal is to produce an extensive English-language catalog, designed as a stand-alone reading experience.\nIf we reach our funding goal, we will print 1000 copies of a full-color softcover catalog around 152 pages long and can ship it worldwide. As a special thank you, every backer (+200 \u20ac | $240) and sponsor (+500 \u20ac | $580 ) will be specifically named in the credits and exhibition!\nThe index offers an overview of the exhibition\u2019s sections and much more.\nThe catalog and the exhibit are separated into six sections, each one casting light on a different aspect of LGBTQIA* game history. First, it will feature a general timeline of potential firsts and milestones of LGBTQIA* representation. The next two will examine how the mainstream gaming industry and independent developers have treated queer narratives and characters over the years. A community section will showcase multiple aspects of LGBTQIA* gaming communities. Of course, we can\u2019t ignore the history of discrimination in game content, in game production, and in gaming communities. In the section covering this topic we will examine the way discrimination and harassment shapes gaming in general and keeps people from participating in game play and development. In the final section, though, RAINBOW ARCADE will look to the future and speculate on what the next level of queer gaming might be.\nIndividual exhibits (shown here: Caper in the Castro) will be presented with in-depth commentaries.\nFurthermore, RAINBOW ARCADE includes developer interviews with C.M.Ralph (Caper in the Castro, 1989) and Ryan Best (GayBlade, 1992) and specially commissioned essays by Naomi Clark (Consentacle, 2018), Zoyander Street (Elixir, 2016; Interactive Portraits, 2018), Dietrich Squinkifer (Dominique Pamplemousse 1+2, 2013, 2017), and Robert Yang (Radiator 2, 2015). It will also showcase other ephemera from gaming culture, including player mods, fanart and screenshots.\nTestimonial by C.M.Ralph (Caper in the Castro)\nTestimonial by Naomi Clark (Consentacle) \nTestimonial by Zoyander Street (Elixir, Interactive Trans Portraits)\nThe exhibition RAINBOW ARCADE will be first on display at the Schwules Museum in Berlin, Germany from December 14th, 2018 to May 13th, 2019. It is curated by an international team consisting of Sarah Rudolph (herzteile.org), Jan Schnorrenberg (Schwules Museum) and Dr. Adrienne Shaw (Temple University, LGBTQ Game Archive). Nicolas Simoneau (KALTBLUT Magazine) is in charge of exhibition and visual design. The exhibition itself is funded by the Berlin Senate Department for Culture and Europe. RAINBOW ARCADE is under the patronage of Dr. Klaus Lederer, Senator for Culture and Europe of Berlin.\nScreenshot of Succulent (2017), part of the gay sex triptych Radiator 2 by Robert Yang\nIt will present nearly 100 individual exhibits, including a variety of playable titles like Caper in the Castro (1989), Elixir (2016), This Is Where I Want To Die (2013), Dominique Pamplemousse 1+2 (2013, 2017) and Radiator 2 (2015).\nSchwules Museum (Gay Museum) is the oldest and largest LGBTQIA* related museum and archive in the world. Since its founding in 1985, it has been dedicated to collecting and preserving the heritage of the LGBTQIA* community and is an important and vital institution that fully relies on the support and work from within the community.\nInternationally recognized exhibitions in the past include Magnus Hirschfeld \u2013 a life in objects, books & documents (2011-2012), Lesbian. Jewish. Gay. (2013), Porn That Way (2014-2015), Homosexuality_ies (2015), \u011f \u2013 queer forms migrate (2017) and Marc Martin: Fenster zum Klo. Public Toilets & Private Affairs (2017-2018). Right now, Schwules Museum is host to the YEAR OF THE WOMEN*, a queer-feminist intervention consisting of a year-long exhibition and event programme.\nWith its rich history, SMU is the perfect place to showcase the incredible history of LGBTQIA* video games, many of which will be shown in a museum for the very first time.\nHere is an overview of our perks.There are many ways to support us. You can purchase a digital or analog catalog or even become a backer or sponsor - there are many extra benefits ranging from thank you cards, early bird offers and free museum admissions to game related gifts or private group tours.

Set in the Fading Suns Universe, where the suns themselves are dying, humanity battles to revive its lost greatness - or just take what is left. The five great Royal Houses dominate human space as they battle each other for control of the greatest resource - humanity itself.\nIn Noble Armada: Lost Worlds, players take on the role of a noble in one of the five Royal houses, vying against rival fleets and houses for control of human space. They battle pirates, barbarians, heretics and others in their quest for supremacy. Noble Armada is a game of broadsides and boarding actions, as players maneuver their ships to line up their best shots, fire off broadsides of fiery energy and then board their enemies to end the battle with desperate boarding actions. As they travel from planet to planet, making allies and building up their fleets, they also gain the experience they need to make their crews and marines truly formidable. \nPLAY\n\nThe game is wrapping up its alpha testing, which we hope you can tell from the videos. Along the way we realized there were several great additions for which we did not originally budget. This Kickstarter is to help fund development of a Mission Editor to be distributed along with the game, in addition to Android and iOS ports of the game. Should we raise more than the $3500 that would take, we have a number of stretch goals we would like to fund as well.\nPlayers can choose from a wide variety of missions involving five different houses. They can also design their own battles in the game\u2019s Skirmish mode. There they choose what ships they and their enemies command, as well as the victory conditions. The video game version of Noble Armada takes the miniatures game and turns it into a fast-paced strategy game. It utilizes the original miniature game mechanics while taking advantage of the best features of its new digital home.\nCommand a fleet of four ships from one of the five Royal Houses.\nBattle enemy vessels at range or board for fierce hand-to-hand combat.\nMultiple battle objectives include Seize the Space Station, Destroy All Ships, Onslaught mod and more. \nSeize Station\nConduct boarding assaults against enemy ships and defend yours from enemy marine incursion.\nBoarding\nUpgrade your ship weapons, crew and boarding forces at various planet facilities and build a stronger fleet. \nVarious campaigns set in the Fading Suns universe document the great battles between Houses.\nThe campaign editor allows nobles such as yourself to document and share new stories of your own design!\nRobust skirmish mode allows you to test your mettle in hundreds of combat setting variations, providing endless play. \nSkirmish Mode\n            Follow us\nWeb site: http://www.holistic-design.com/noble-armada/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/NobleArmada/\nTwitter: @HDIAndrew\nDeveloper Diary: http://andrewgreenberg.com/\nVideos: YouTube Playlist\nThe Team\nAndrew Greenberg, Producer\n Andrew Greenberg, co-creator of the Fading Suns roleplaying and computer games and original developer of White Wolf\u2019s Vampire: The Masquerade, has been making games since 1990.

Chris also has experience as a commercial artist and art/advertising/print production director.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis may sound like a small amount to fund a game, but Noble Armada: Lost Worlds is already wrapping up alpha and moving into beta! We are running this Kickstarter to fund the fun ideas that appeared late in the development process. For instance, while our Mission Editor already works, it is not something a person outside our development team can understand, much less use. We want to turn it into a fun tool for anyone, and that requires good user interface design.\n\nWhile the game and its tools are almost done, there are always risks that can derail a project. We are already working to minimize these. When we teach game design at colleges, we stress that a core risk is the way changes in code can irreconcilably break other functions. To mitigate this, we have multiple redundant backups, and maintain strict version control requirements. More than 100 iterations of the game are stored not only online but also in multiple hard drives across the United States. This allows us to easily revert to working code if a new feature breaks something else.\n\nOne of the main goals of this Kickstarter is to fund ports of this game to multiple platforms via the Fusion 2.5 engine. There is always the worry that relying on an external source (the Fusion 2.5 developers) for key technology can delay a project. However, we have incorporated one of the Fusion 2.5 developers into our team in order to ensure that we always have their most up-to-date tools and follow their best practices.\n\nWe have even made sure that one of the key risks Kickstarter backers suffer - that promised rewards may never be created - is all but eliminated. Every physical reward already exists! We will not complain about manufacturer delays and problems getting them shipped to us. We already have them in storage and look forward to sending your rewards to you.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Explorer", "descp": "Alustro blesses you, and we thank you on our web page and in the game credits.\nINCLUDES:\nCredit in the game", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2018"}], "stat": ["10 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Raider", "descp": "Cardinal Fang Li Halan salutes you, and we thank you on our web page and in the game credits.

But you will slay them and you will shun them and you will stand on the battlements of your fortress as they break against your walls of thorn and iron.  \nYou will be free.\nYou know the stories. The hero leaves his village on a terrifying journey, or the waif finds her way through the cold, dark woods. In the end, they kill the giant or shove the witch in an oven.  \nBut what happens next?  \nIn Changeling: The Lost, you take on the role of an ordinary person who has seen the extraordinary. Lured or abducted by the alien Gentry, you have passed the gates and Hedges between our world and the vast fantastic.  \nIn Arcadia, the Gentry changed you. They forged your flesh and sewed your bones, and they gave you a role to play. You were a lover or a servant or a monster. But it was never your story.  \nHaving run from your Keeper and climbed your way back through the Hedge (and didn\u2019t the thorns bite more than they did going in?), you\u2019re back in the world of pizza and Facebook and nuclear anxiety.  \nYour eyes are open now. You can see that magic is not the sole province of Faerie. The world is alive with wonders most people never see...and rife with horrors that count on that unwariness. It\u2019s all part of your life now. You take the good with the bad, the magic with the monstrosity, the beauty with the madness.  \nIt\u2019s not always an easy story, not always a happy story. But now it\u2019s your story.\nChangeling: The Lost began in 2007, and amassed some of the most passionate fans the Chronicles of Darkness has ever known. Now, it\u2019s reborn in its second edition, which tells new tales and builds on lessons learned in the past ten years. We\u2019re jumping back into the brambles, and letting the scar tissue from last time protect us.\nThis CHANGELING: THE LOST 2nd Edition Kickstarter is designed to enable us to create a prestige hardcover edition designed to match the look and feel of our other Chronicles of Darkness core rulebooks such as Vampire: The Requiem, Werewolf: The Forsaken, or Mage: The Awakening...     \nWe want to create an 8.5\" x 11\" hardcover with a beautifully designed, symbolic cover image printed on a metallic under layer, and featuring an emboss/deboss of the logo. We estimate the book to be more than 300 pages, with a two-color interior and endpapers on high quality paper stock.\nChangeling: The Lost, Second Edition will include the many kinds of changelings and their Courts, powers and other perks for the Lost, antagonists such as Huntsmen, Hedge Ghosts, and of course the True Fae, and cities from around the world with their own local Courts.\nChapters include:\nThe Fair and the Foul: Seemings (the fairy tale roles changelings play) and Courts (the most common groups in changeling culture).  \nMore in Heaven and Earth: The worlds changelings move through, and descriptions of changeling culture.  \nWords of Wonder: Character creation, Contracts (powers) and Merits for changelings.  \nWords of Binding: The core Chronicles of Darkness rules, plus subsystems like Hedge shaping and dream battles.  \nShared Nightmares: Allies and antagonists for the Lost, ranging from goblins to True Fae.  \nAll the Kingdoms of the Earth: Changeling society in different cities, including local Courts for each one.  \nTales Around the Fire: Storytelling advice, including Chronicle-building, rules for creating new Courts and Contracts, and player safety advice.\nAppendix: The Fae-Touched: Character creation for those bound by promises they made to changelings before the changelings' abduction.\nThroughout the campaign, we will be posting previews of the Changeling: The Lost 2nd Edition manuscript as updates for all backers. \nThe goals of this project are threefold:\nFirst, and most important, we\u2019re running this Kickstarter so we can make the best version of Changeling: The Lost 2nd Edition that is possible. Getting your support early allows us to fund the best production, use the most appropriate components, and possibly even add more art to the core book.\nSecond, we're able to use funding to explore more of the Changeling world, even expanding into rules companions or fiction anthologies. The greater our funding on the Kickstarter, the more resources we are able to devote to exploring this setting.\nThird, we're able to celebrate the legacy of Changeling: The Lost by offering a great deal on a list of first edition Changeling: The Lost titles in PDF. The Arcadian Dreams digital bundle is included in several reward tiers, or can be added to any reward, and begins with 7 titles from the first edition library. As we expand our funding on the entire project, we will be able to add titles to this bundle making it a truly amazing offer.\nBeyond all of those campaign-specific goals, we hope to do what our games have always done - build a community invested in each other's stories and shared imagination. Every person who participates is joining with the goal of bringing this game into the world, and that common goal is a powerful binding element that we can't help but want to share. When you back this project, you join us on this journey and become part of our motley band.\nAll participants who would like to make this project happen can pledge their support and add to the overall campaign total. If the campaign meets the funding target ($50,000), then we will have funded the project and it will become a reality. Your pledge will only be collected if we achieve our funding target.\nIn exchange for your support, we offer rewards based on your level of funding pledged. The Reward Tiers down the right side of the page outline the various rewards reflecting various levels of support pledged.\nThe two main rewards of note:\nAll Pledge Tiers of $25 or greater will receive a digital PDF copy of the CHANGELING: THE LOST 2nd Edition Core Rules.\nAll Pledge Tiers of $50 or greater will receive a traditionally-printed, hardcover copy of the CHANGELING: THE LOST 2nd Edition Core Rules. \nIn addition, several reward tiers will include a coupon for \"at cost\" Print on Demand physical books you can choose to purchase from DriveThruRPG.com, usually some time after the PDF has been released. This allows us time to collect errata and revise the final ready-for-print file before sending it to publication. You DO NOT need to take advantage of this discount PoD offer as it does not affect in any way your pledge rewards. Note that there will be a shipping charge issued by DriveThruRPG.com whenever a PoD product is ordered. \nA further consideration is our \"Arcadian Memories\" digital bundle. For only $10, you will receive every 1st Edition Changeling: The Lost title included in the bundle. The bundle begins with 7 PDF offerings from the Changeling: The Lost library, but may expand as we hit additional funding goals. To receive all the titles that end up included in this bundle, you can increase your total pledge level by $10 (see ADD ONs below), or choose a Reward Tier that already features the bundle, such as:\nWarrior of the Silent Arrow ($10)\nDefender of the Silent Arrow ($35)\nSentinel of the Silent Arrow ($60)\nDisciple of the Antler Crown ($80)\nBeyond those basic considerations, we also have premium reward tiers, offering everything from signed copies (Heart of the Leaden Mirror, $110) to becoming an art model for a future Changeling: The Lost project (Elder of the Antler Crown, $400), to even acting as a Consulting Developer on a future project (Champion of the Silent Arrow, $800). So please read through all reward tiers carefully to see what each one offers.\nIf, working together, we're able to achieve our funding goal, we will set supplemental targets and offer additional rewards. These will be detailed as they arise in the \"Stretch Goal\" section below.\nPlease note that rewards that include physical goods (such as the hardcover book or the Storyteller's Screen) may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses. \nWe love retailers, but modern publishing methods don\u2019t always make it easy for them to get books into their stores. With CHANGELING: THE LOST 2nd Edition, we want to try to get at least one print run into game stores, so everyone has a chance to experience it.  \nAny retailer who pledges at the retailer reward tier level (Goblin Market Merchant) will get five copies of the traditionally printed hardcover book, as well as five copies of the Storyteller's Screen, at a retail-specific discount so that they can sell in-store.\nIn addition to the rewards listed in each reward tier, backers can increase their overall pledge to add on the following additional rewards. Simply increase your total pledge level by the amount indicated \u2013 we will confirm which add on rewards you\u2019ve chosen via BackerKit surveys after the campaign has run.\n Add $20 to your pledge total to get an additional copy of the PDF version of the Changeling: The Lost 2nd Edition core rules.

Each Stretch Goal will have a target that, once reached, will unlock a new reward. We will continue to build on this list when we achieve these targets during the campaign.

This knowledge has been applied to the FAQ linked here: http://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: This book isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped seventeen Kickstarter projects and several more are headed to completion as you read this. All those projects have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, sometimes painfully, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The text for Changeling: The Lost 2nd Edition is finished, and we are only looking at adding additional art to the book itself.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of Changeling: The Lost 2nd Edition.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise this last year, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to up the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing.\n\nRisk: The books will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several KS projects several months before the estimate, and our last ship-out, for Pugmire, started a month earlier than estimated.\nThat being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver Updates on progress once a month (or more, as needed) via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Initiate of the Equinox", "descp": "Thanks for your support!

VR stands for virtual reality; each of these films are being created as 360 films that you watch in a headset for a fully immersive experience. Our first piece, Eagle Bone screened at Toronto International Film Festival as one of five pieces chosen from around the world. We were chosen among projects that had budgets that dwarf our project which was made for next to no money and relied upon sweat equity.\nThe Projects\nCh'aak' S'aagi (Eagle Bone) \n\nDirector - Tracy Rector\nFeaturing the voices of Ken Workman and Nahaan, Eagle Bone is a collective step in a new direction of visual storytelling rooted in being unapologetically Indigenous. Through freestyle spoken word and lush Pacific Northwest scenes, the viewer experiences a VR journey of remembrance and reflection on the lessons of the old ones. Teachings that remind us that we are all individual vessels of spirit and change, yet inextricably connected.\nPOWER \nDirector - Lynn Shelton \nCast: Cherdonna Shinatra, Matt Smith, Jody Kuehner \nA VR experience created by award-winning filmmaker Lynn Shelton. Part improvised narrative, part performance art, POWER deals with authority, wealth, vulnerability, drag queens, and more. Featuring the amazing Cherdonna Shinatra!\n  Experience PRIDE\nDirector: Dacia Saenz\nThe pilot episode in an eventual VR doc series of intimate portraits of LGBTQ community members sharing stories of times they were alienated and/or discriminated against, illustrated by comic artist Robyn Jordan. The project invites viewers to immerse themselves in the experiences of those who have been marginalized, discriminated against, and then step into an environment flooded with acceptance, celebration and pride--specifically, footage of the Seattle PRIDE parade.\nDom: A Story of Rebellion\nDirector: Netsanet Tijrongo\nAn immersive doc experience where viewers meet Evanna, a black dominatrix who gives us a glimpse of what it's like to be under her control.\nSlow Moving Houses\nDirector: Mischa Jakupcak\nA comedic, dreamlike cinematic journey about a young girl who interrupts a stranger at his lowest moment and leads him through a surreal discovery, proving his life is not over yet.\nArcadia Flats\nDirector - Joe Jacobs\nCast: Jessica Martin, Evan Mosher, Marc Kenison A short VR horror film about a young woman struggling with a newly discovered condition that puts her--and everyone she comes into contact with--in grave danger.\nOur first project, the poetic documentary experience Eagle Bone, was selected to screen as one of only five VR films at the recent Toronto International Film Festival. It was made with sweat equity and we need funds to compensate the amazing performers for their contributions, and send director Tracy Rector to other film festivals. \nFor our other projects, POWER and Arcadia Flats have both been filmed. But to complete them, we need some resources to finish post production. \nDom, Experience Pride, and Slow Moving Houses are all budgeted at next to nothing, but there are some hard costs we can't get around. These include rental of spaces for the locations, food and catering for our crew and small stipends for actors.\nHello Mechanical Dreamers!\nWe have another video to share with you. This one is highlighting Arcadia Flats, the werewolf thriller piece written and directed by Mechanical Dream's own Joe Jacobs!\nWith less than 50 hours to reach our goal, we want to take this time and thank you all from the bottom of our hearts for your support. Please help us spread the word about our Kickstarter so we can successfully see all of our projects through to completion.\nIn the meantime, don't be too scared...Enjoy sneak peak of Arcadia Flats...\nWho are we? \nMDVR Team at Gasworks Park, Seattle\nMDVR was founded by five filmmakers: Lacey Leavitt, Mischa Jakupcak, Joe Jacobs, Mara Auster, and Chris Mosson. Our backgrounds include everything from award-winning Sundance feature films to high-end, glossy commercials. We're so excited about the new VR medium, and the new storytelling possibilities it's opened up. We're equally excited about starting a new industry with equality in mind. VR is unique in that the viewer gets to be completely immersed in a new perspective. We're excited to work with a diverse range of filmmakers and artists, to give audiences truly unique perspectives.\nHelp us build the future, together!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are seasoned professionals and have already been through the VR film pipeline.

With the help of a growing list of partners like Xbox, Intel, the MIT Game Lab and so many others, we're determined to address the gender gap in the games industry, one camp at a time. \nEmily's story is not unique. From being stereotyped to being ignored, it's hard work trying to combat the hostility that women - especially young women - face in video game communities these days.\nOne of the reasons we started Girls Make Games was to give burgeoning young developers in the face of these sometimes discouraging experiences the confidence and experience they'll need to pursue careers in video games or technology.\nThe more support we can get for programs like Girls Make Games, the more confident young women will feel about becoming developers - knowing that others like them are getting the recognition, encouragement, and support they need.\nA special Thank You to all our industry partners and sponsors!\nLet's be Friends!\nThe girls and team would be very thankful if you could help spread the news about this game development project on Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, Instagram, or whichever social media network you prefer.\n\nPlease feel free to leave a comment on this Kickstarter, or follow us on Facebook or Twitter!!! We would love your feedback.\nNext Year and BEYOND\nWe're so excited to share that as of this August, 929 girls that have gone through Girls Make Games summer camps + workshops around the world! \n\nSome interesting stats:\n#Cities: 38 US + international\n#Events (camps/workshops): 61\nNew international cities this year (2016):\nLahore, Pakistan,\nSao Palo, Brazil\nBerlin, Germany\nLondon, UK\nAl Ain, UAE \nMontreal, Canada\nFor the first time ever, we're also launching an online curriculum this December that will be available for download at no cost.

We work with government agencies and NGOs, and the missions are covered in our TV series \"The Operatives.\"\nWe've closed down multiple shark finning, illegal fishing, and illegal gold mining operations. We exposed the brutal seal clubbing in Namibia and several illegal logging operations in Indonesia. We tackled the wildlife trade that\u2019s devastating Asia\u2019s endangered animals. We even rescued a dolphin that was being illegally held in a tiny little swimming pool. \nOur New Ship\nWe could do so much more if we had our own ship. So last year we started designing an awesome new vessel \u2013 Earthrace 2 - to become our base of operations. Testing is done and with your help, we will complete the design process. \nOur first Vessel - Earthrace\nEarthrace 2 is based on our original Earthrace, which ran on renewable fuel and still holds the record for circling the globe.  We launched this vessel in 2006 and despite being small, and with a crew of just 6, she played a key role in campaigning against Japanese Whaling in Antarctica, as well as in promoting renewable fuels. \nThe new boat will be a larger tri-hull wavepiercer that can handle almost any seas. Earthrace 2 will hold a crew of 26, which will often include local enforcement team members to ensure that criminals we catch are successfully prosecuted.  \nSpecifications as follows:\nDesigners:  LOMOcean Design\nMax Guest Capacity in port: 200\nCampaign Crew Capacity:  26\nOvernight Guest Capacity: 12\nOn-board Theatre Capacity: 30 people\nStaterooms: 5\nDesign: Wavepiercing Trimaran\nConstruction: Sandwich composite \nLength: 59.3m (195ft) \nBeam: 12m (39ft) \nRange: 10,000nm at 12 knots \nMax Speed:  20-25 Knots\n1st Tender:  7.7 m (29ft) Sealegs Amphibious Vessel\n2nd tender: Zodiac Milpro 470\nAux Power:  Skysail Kite System\nCAD Diagrams\n  Earthrace-2 Missions\nEarthrace-2 will be used in a variety of roles that continues our work in saving animals and habitats.  These include:\nMaritime Conservation Missions \nFisheries Enforcement\nScientific Research\nAnti Poaching\nAnti Wildlife Smuggling\nProtection of Endangered Species\nOur fisheries enforcement will increase into areas such as Africa where poachers today wreak havoc. We will run additional Anti-poaching missions in coastal and inland areas, especially where the vessel can serve as an Operational Base. In some regions we'll also offer services to science and conservation Agencies with projects to remote Islands. Through all this will be a spinoff TV show from \"The Operatives\", opening people's eyes to what is really happening around our precious planet. \nThe final role for Earthrace-2 will be in the Outreach Tour. This is similar to the Original Earthrace tour that saw over 250,000 people come aboard our vessel. For four months each year, we will call into coastal cities through North America, Europe and elsewhere, and be open to School groups, public, media and other NGOs. This is also the time when many of our backers can join us in port and collect their rewards.\nRewards\nThe best rewards involve joining us on board Earthrace-2.  For $10 come and have a coffee with us on the back deck while we're on the Outreach tour.  Host an event on-board for up to 200 guests in port, or take 12 friends offshore for an exclusive overnight luxury experience.\nFor those looking for more adventure, join us in one of many dive trips to the world's most remote locations. Or join us on a campaign and help us with catching poachers across the Pacific, with Scientific research in the Sub-Antarctic, or with filming nature up the Amazon. There are many ways for you to get involved, and some are once-in-a-lifetime opportunities.  \nOur Team \nThe Earthrace team has a proven track record.  Our Naval Architects are LOMOcean Design who have developed a number of amazing vessels, including the original Earthrace.  \nThe Earthrace team was successful in raising the funds and building this first vessel, and then in 2008 set a new record for a powerrboat to circle the globe. Around this was the Outreach tour that saw over a quarter million people walk aboard her over a 3 year period.\nOur film crew has a proven track record with \"The Operatives\" TV Series. We've produced two seasons and 18 episodes of compelling television that has helped enormously in raising important conservation issues.\nMost importantly, our team has delivered in addressing wildlife crime.  We've closed down a number of illegal operations in many parts of the world, and we will continue to do this. \nOutreach Tour Locations\nEarthrace-2 will spend a period of time each year running an Outreach Tour calling at Coastal Cities around the World to promote our conservation messages.  Our supporters will be invited down to collect their rewards which may include coffee, meals, excursions or events.  Below are proposed outreach cities.  \nNorth America Outreach Tour\n  Outreach Tour UK/Ireland\n         European Outreach Tour\n      New Zealand Outreach Tour\n  Australia Outreach Tour\n   Project Timeline\n  Jun 2016.

Generally we will focus on areas in most need of assistance, but also accommodating the Outreach Tour commitments.  Rewards will mostly be collected when the vessel is at a port city nearest you. In some cases rewards may be collected while the vessel is on campaign.  Supporters will be kept up to date as the project proceeds to ensure everyone has the opportunity to remain involved.\nEarthrace-2 Design Render\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe major challenge once design is finished is to raise the funds and complete construction. We have demonstrated that we can do this with the previous completion of Earthrace, launched in 2006. \n\nCollection of rewards in many cases is dependent on the Outreach Tour that calls to North America, Europe and elsewhere. The tour largely repeats the original Earthrace tour from 2006-2009. We have a demonstrated ability to run such tours, and link with local Schools, Media public, and the corporate sectors. \n\nNote the collection of rewards on the vessel is also dependent on the tour schedule. It is likely the vessel will tour the USA / Canada first, followed by Europe, and then to New Zealand and Australia. Around this will also be our Conservation Missions. Supporters should be cognisant that we cannot tour all locations in the first year, but that with time, all supporters will all get the opportunity to collect their rewards. \n\nThe other challenge in delivery is our Conservation Missions. These can be very difficult. Over the last six years we have shown we can run these successfully. A number of environmental criminals are behind bars because of our work. We have highlighted many conservation issues through our TV show. And we have definitely made the world a fractionally better place with our work.

After 20 years in the AAA industry, this project is teaching me new things. Even if it was just half as ambitious as it is, it would be a must-have.\"- Matt Pritchard, AAA Industry veteran, developer of RTS games, FPS, Mobile F2P, and IoT devices, author and expert on multiplayer cheating.\nWhat's the Big Idea?\nOne of 20+ illustrations from Vol.1\nThe idea behind this book is to summarize the body of knowledge that already exists on multiplayer games but is not available in one single place. And quite a few of the issues discussed within this series (planned as three volumes 400+ pages each), while known in the industry, have not been published at all (except for maybe in discussion forums). \nProgramming and deploying an MOG is a daunting task, and having a frame of reference is usually quite helpful \u2014 \"hey, those guys have already tried this, and it worked for them.\"\nBy the end of Vol. 1, we'll complete our discussion of the things related to architecting your MOG, and will be ready to start discussing \"Development\" (Vol. 2) and \"Deployment\" (Vol. 3). For more details on what's within the book, see the tentative Table of Contents (it also includes links to all the beta chapters from Vol. 1). \nThis current project is only about Vol. 1, \"Architecture,\" but Vol. 2 and Vol. 3 are already planned (and obviously my enthusiasm about them will get an additional boost when Vol. 1 is successfully funded ;-)). \nWhy Me?\nI really hate to speak about myself, but this is one of those cases where I don't have much choice. So, here it goes (and if you really want further details, you can dig them out of my LinkedIn page).\n20 years ago (damn, I am getting old) I was a co-architect for an electronic stock exchange of a G20 country, and for all practical intents and purposes stock exchanges are just another game genre. The project was fun and, among other things, allowed for real-time trading over the cellphones of that time (those with 9600 baud connection).\nA few years later, I became a chief software architect working for a start-up that quickly grew into a rather large online game with half a million simultaneous players that processed half a billion user transactions per day. The project taught me a damn lot about such different issues as scalability, DB physical layout, server farms, attackers and cheaters of all kinds, and bot fighting \u2014 just to name a few.\nSince then, I have consulted and performed due diligence on several game-related projects. In addition, I've spent quite some time researching the field and discussing related problems and their respective solutions with people from the industry.\nI feel that this puts me in quite a unique position of knowing not only one single game, but a bunch of them, and being able to summarize and generalize my real-world experiences. Oh, and I have been writing for industry journals (and am especially proud of articles in CUJ and C++ Report) since 1998, so the process of typing sentences is not something new for me either.\nSince When Are Rabbits Programming??\nFrom an 2010 article in Overload\nI cannot speak for all of rabbitkind, but this particular hare has gone alongside my writings for quite a while now. He was born as \"No MT Bugs\" Hare in 2010, in an Overload article titled \"Single-Threading: Back to the Future?\"\nTherefore, there is evidence that this particular rabbit has been programming at least since 2010. Yes, he has changed his appearance, but deep inside, he is still the very same bunny with a na\u00efve idea of making programs less buggy. BTW, the character is created by Sergey Gordeev, a guy with many animation awards, known (among other things) for being a director of some of the Animated Mr. Bean series.\nWho Is this Book For?\nThe book is intended for those intermediary developers who want to become senior ones, and for senior developers and up. I expect that the book will also be useful for decision-makers, from PMs all the way up to CEOs \u2014 so if you by any chance know one, please make sure to give her a link to this page ;-). \nOn the other hand, if you are working on your first programming project, this book will probably be too difficult for you. There will be no explanation on what event-driven programming is all about, what the difference is between optimistic locking and pessimistic locking, why you need a source control system, and so on. Instead, there will be discussions on how the concept of futures fits into event-driven programming, when the use of optimistic locking make sense for games, and how to use source control in the presence of unmergeable files. \nIn the same spirit, the book is not intended to be a CD to copy-paste your sample MOG from. Instead, the book aims to help you write your own code that is tailored to your own needs, and tries to advise on the available choices at most of the junctions.\nWhat's the Plan?\nCurrently, the \"beta\" chapters of the Vol.1 are already available on my blog ithare.com. The same \"beta\" posts are also available re-formatted as a single PDF (11.1M, 355 PDF pages; please note that this is NOT how the book is going to look). \nSteps still to complete to bring the \"beta\" draft into the shape of the ready-for-printing Vol.1:\nRestructure Vol.1. Done.\nGo through Vol.1 again, \"harmonizing\" and clarifying things. I expect to add about 30'000 words during this process (give or take). Current progress: ~30% completed, 12'000 words already added. ETA: July 2016. At this point all the backers will get an (MS Word) draft.\nMake another pass through Vol.1, this time is more about self-editing (not that much will need be changed at this stage, I hope). ETA: August 2016. At this point all the backers should get another (MS Word) draft.\nGive it to a professional copyeditor. Cost estimate: $3100 (140'000 words @ $0.022/word). ETA: September 2016. At this point all the backers will get yet another (MS Word) draft. \nGive it to a book design/layout specialist. Cost estimate: $2900 ($500 overall design + 400 pages@$6/page). ETA: October 2016. At this point E-BOOK rewards will be sent out.\nPrint paperbacks with CreateSpace, and get them sent to backers. ETA - November 2016. At this point PAPERBACK rewards will be sent out.\nStart selling Vol.1 on Amazon (planned price is $24.95 for Kindle, and $34.95 for paperback)\nBecome rich and retire to the Bahamas ;-). On second thought - this book probably won't suffice ;-(.\nWhat's Inside?\nPretty much all MOG genres are within the scope of the book, from MMOFPS on one side of the spectrum to social games on the other side \u2014 with stock exchanges and multi-player casino games in between. However, things such as gameplay (including AI), and monetization are intentionally left out. In addition, the areas of physics and 3D graphics are too large by themselves and \u2014 to avoid expanding this into a 10-volume series \u2014 are only discussed very briefly (with pointers to good books on these subjects provided).\nAn excerpt from the tentative full ToC of the Vol.1: \nChapter I. Game Design Document from an MOG Perspective\nChapter II. On Cheating, P2P, and [non-]Authoritative Servers\nChapter III. Protocols\nRTT, Input Lag, and How to Mitigate Them (includes Client-Side Interpolation, Client-Side Prediction, and Lag Compensation)\nGame World States and Reducing Traffic Publishable State, Interest Management, and different Compression techniques)\nPoint-to-Point Communications and Non-Blocking RPCs (including discussion on message queues)\nIDL (includes hints on writing your own IDL compiler)\nChapter IV. DIY vs Re-Use. In Search of Balance\nChapter V. Event-Driven Programming\nClassical Event-Driven Programs\nDeterministic Event-Driven Programs (including benefits such as production post-mortem for both client and server, replay testing, and so on)\nRPC Processing in Event-Driven Programs: from Plain Event Processing to Futures (with lambda call pyramids in between)\nRelation to Actors, Node.js, and Erlang\nChapter VI. Client-Side Architecture\nGraphics (only very basics)\nProgramming Language for Client-Side\nClient-Side Architecture Diagram (based on multiple event-driven objects)\nChapter VII. Server-Side Architecture\nNa\u00efve Architectures\nWeb-Based Architecture (including write-back caching and locking strategies)\nClassical Architecture\nFront-End Servers\nLoad Balancing (including Round-Robin DNS, Server-Side Balancing and Client-Side Random Balancing)\nEternal Linux-vs-Windows Debate\nProgramming Languages for Server-Side\nChapter VIII. Unity 5 vs UE4 vs Photon vs DIY for MOG\nChapter IX. Pre-Coding Checklist: Things Everybody Hates, but Everybody Needs. From Source Control to Coding Guidelines\nChapter IX concludes Vol.1; for the list of the Chapters planned in Vol.2 and Vol.3, see the full tentative ToC.\nSTRETCH GOAL @10K: +50% ILLUSTRATIONS - REACHED!\nAs we have reached our first stretch goal @EUR 8K, it is time to announce our NEXT STRETCH GOAL. If we reach EUR10'000, then we'll ask our illustrator Sergey Gordeev (who is more known for his animation awards and directing Animated Mr Bean) to draw additional 10 or so illustrations for the book, increasing the number of illustrations in Vol. 1 by approximately 50%!\nIn addition, if we reach this goal, it will be our backers who decide on the face of the 'No Bugs' which is used in the book (see options here: http://ithare.com/facelift-for-no-bugs/ ). While we already had a vote on it on the site, results were not conclusive, so (at least for the book) we'll defer to the vote of our Kickstarter backers!\nSTRETCH GOAL @8K: \"KICKSTARTER SPECIAL\" EDITION - REACHED!\nAs we're now 100% funded (BIG THANKS TO ALL THE BACKERS!), here comes our STRETCH GOAL (which will become available at reaching the number of EUR8000). If we reach this stretch goal, all the backers will have a choice to have their books/e-books shipped/downloaded either as \"regular\" books, or as \"KICKSTARTER SPECIAL EDITION\" books, with the latter only available to Kickstarter backers.\nThese \"KICKSTARTER SPECIAL EDITION\" books/e-books will get a new cover (probably with \"KICKSTARTER SPECIAL EDITION\" on it), a special \"THANK YOU\" page (and probably a separate ISBN too, though it doesn't really matter). Our illustrator will start working on the Kickstarter cover as soon as we reach this stretch goal, so you will see it sooner rather than later...\nOn \"VIRTUAL PRESENCE\" Consulting\nTwo of the rewards mention \"VIRTUAL PRESENCE\" Consulting. It will be as if I came to your office for the specified number of days. However, I will come not in person, but over Skype or something similar. You will describe your problems to me, and I\u2019ll do my best to advise you on how to solve them. A few notes regarding this:\nHow I use my time during these days is up to you.

I'm excited to share our newest project, Women in Practical Armor.\nEdited by Ed Greenwood and Gabrielle Harbowy, this project is important to all three of us because we feel showcasing an already empowered female warrior is essential. If women in fantasy are capable and intelligent enough to lead in battle, wouldn't they also be intelligent enough to protect their abdomens, tie their hair back, and cover their faces while fighting?\nEvil Girlfriend Media is passionate about breaking stereotypes and creating new mythology, and our goal with this project is to bring you high quality, well-edited stories that will take the fantasy genre to a new level.\nOur authors are a talented and energetic bunch, and as the campaign progresses we'll be sharing interviews, anecdotes, trivia, and special pledge levels from some of the biggest names in science fiction and fantasy. \nEd Greenwood-Editor: An award-winning Canadian writer and game designer, Ed's books have sold millions of copies worldwide, and his writing credits would easily fill this entire page.\nGabrielle Harbowy-Editor: In addition to being the Managing Editor at Dragon Moon Press, Gabrielle is an award-nominated short story writer and anthologist whose first novel comes out next year. This is her fourth anthology collaboration with co-editor Ed Greenwood..\nErik Scott de Bie: The author of eight novels and counting, speculative fiction is only one of Erik's many talents, which include designing tabletop RPGs, mentoring new writers, fencing, and frenetic rock karaoke.\nJudith Tarr: An award-winning fantasy author and frequent finalist on World Fantasy and Locus award ballots, Judith has been writing steadily since her first novel released in 1985.\nTodd J. McCaffrey: New York Times bestselling author Todd McCaffrey has written more than a dozen books and numerous short stories.\nMary Robinette Kowal: Hugo Award-winning author, award-winning puppeteer, and voice actor, Mary Robinette Kowal also won the 2008 Campbell award for Best New Writer, and is one of the hosts of the Hugo Award-winning podcast Writing Excuses.\nBecause we not only want to do this book, we want to do it right. With your generous pledges, this campaign has covered the costs of production in advance. Our continuing goal is to secure funds to properly market Women in Practical Armor as a major release, as well as pave the way for similar projects in the future.\nOne important component of our Kickstarter that we want backers to know is that the first month of royalties of the book will go to a PTSD charity chosen by Gabrielle Harbowy and me. Every day can feel like a battle for those with PTSD, and we want our backers to know that because of them funding the book, we want to give back.\nWe've got an armory full of great rewards for our backers, so why not try one on for size? As the campaign progresses, we'll be unveiling special offers from our authors, add-ons for your pledges, and more!\nHere's a look at a couple items besides the anthology itself included in our backer levels.\n\nStarting at the PATENT OF NOBILITY level ($50 or more), backers receive a limited edition medallion keychain, crafted by Eloise J. Knapp.\nAt the CLOTH COIF level ($150 or more) Editor Gabrielle Harbowy is offering to knit a \"yarn mail\" hood for five lucky backers. Crafted from a design by (and used with permission) Etsy creator WeeBeeUniquesByJulie, it's the perfect thing to keep your head warm and protected while reading our mind-blowing stories!\nThis coif is only one of the special offers put forth by our creators. For example, Contributor Eric Landreneau has offered an e-book copy of his novel Break! A Tale of Cursed Blood to all backers at the CAP level and above.\nBut this book is bigger than just us, and as mentioned above we want to market and promote it as a major release. Your pledges enable us to do just that, and now that we've funded, we're counting on your help to spread the word about how awesome it is.\nSo let's talk about\nThanks to your support, we've covered the costs of production, including paying our authors and artists professional rates. We know all the places we'd like to market this book, and we know more or less what it costs to do so.\nAnd it costs a lot. Money most independent publishers don't have to spend, so many great projects never go out to more than a few hundred people. We're looking to all of our new friends to help us spread the message in the time we have left, so that we can give Women in Practical Armor the launch it deserves.\nOur first two stretch goals are modest ones, but they have significant impact on how we move forward in marketing the book.\n$7000\nBacker T-shirts (UNLOCKED)\nThanks to our backers, our wonderful Women in Practical Armor T-shirts are now included in all backer levels $100 and up, and are available as $25 add-ons to backer levels MAIL SHIRT and higher. So check out this awesome backer exclusive in the Add-Ons section below, and get ready for our next stretch goal of...\n$10000\nRaises for WiPA contributors (UNLOCKED)\nWe're already paying our authors professional rates, but we'd love to pay them more. So if we raise at least $10000 with this campaign, we'll be re-writing our contracts to compensate them at 8 cents a word.\nThat's kind of a big deal. And it will certainly raise some eyebrows in the publishing world. Which is exactly what we want. We're changing the world, remember? It starts story by story, one word at a time. And with your help, we'll be there before you know it.\n$12500\nEd Greenwood and Gabrielle Harbowy (UNLOCKED)\nYou probably know by now that our esteemed co-editors can put together a great book, but did you know they can write? Because if we can raise least $12500 with this campaign, they\u2019ve agreed to co-author an original story for Women in Practical Armor! We\u2019re really excited about this stretch goal, and hope you are too.\n$15000\nBackers-only Release Party (UNLOCKED)\nNorwescon 39 in Seatac, WA is a major science fiction event in the Pacific Northwest, and just so happens to fall right in our expected release window. We\u2019re going to be there promoting the heck out of Women in Practical Armor and other EGM releases, but we also want to recognize all the backers whose support made this project possible.\nSo let\u2019s be honest, of course we\u2019re going to have a party. But instead of just a noisy affair in a cramped convention hotel room, we want to invite the entire legion to celebrate with us at once! So if we raise at least $15000 with this campaign, we\u2019re closing the doors to the general public, and opening it up the entire world.\nThat\u2019s right, if we hit this goal the WiPA backer party will be broadcast live on the web, and you\u2019re all invited! We\u2019ll have contests, prizes, contributor interviews and advance readings, as well as a few surprises. (I have it on good authority that Queen Katie loves to sing).\n$20000\nBecause some women like to do it alone, in the shadows.\nThis stretch goal is one we\u2019ve wanted to announce since this campaign started. Women in Practical Armor was never meant to be alone on your bookshelf. It was meant to be the first of several anthologies featuring already empowered female protagonists. So with this in mind, we're now proud to announce the second volume in the series, and our final stretch goal for this campaign.\nWomen in Comfortable Shoes will present stories of rogues, thieves, assassins, and other self-assured ladies, and with your help, we can do it in style. Right now we can't share much more information than the title, but if we hit our stretch goal we'll be able to guarantee the same pay rate of 8 cents a word to all our authors that we're offering for Women in Practical Armor.\nBut wait, there's more.\n Battle Ready Poster ($10)\nActual woman in practical armor Ann Shilling\nWe teased our Battle-Ready backer poster on day one, and are now prepared to share more about it.  \nAs a $10 add-on for backers at PAULDRONS level and higher, we're offering this full color, 12 x 18 poster detailing the armor worn by real-life woman in practical armor Ann Shilling during our Kickstarter video.\nAnd if that weren't enough, we've got a special reward for our backers at MAIL SHIRT and higher levels. It's this crazy new book called...\nExtra Copy ($12)\nYou've already secured yourself a copy of our trade paperback, and possibly even an e-book as well. But what about your friends? No matter how successful our campaign is, or our subsequent marketing efforts, there will always be someone down the line who's looking for a good read and just doesn't know what to pick.\nBut you do. As a $12 add-on, you can order an additional trade paperback of Women in Practical Armor to share with them. This backer-exclusive price is only available through this campaign, and is available multiple times per pledge.\nBacker T-Shirts ($25)\nSo cool. So Comfortable\nWe've been talking about \"mobile marketing\" for a while now, and although some Kickstarter campaigns lead with extras like this, we wanted to keep the focus on the book and our authors. Now that that's out of the way, we're happy to announce our Women in Practical Armor backer shirts.\nThese great shirts are available as a $25 add-on to backer levels MAIL SHIRT and higher, and automatically included in all backer levels $100 and higher.\nTo add any of these great bonus items to your existing backer reward, increase your total pledge (using the \"Manage Pledge\" option) to cover the cost of each item you want. \nFor a poster, add $10 to your pledge\nFor an additional trade paperback, add $12 to your pledge\nFor a backer t-shirt, add $25 to your pledge\nThere's no need to change your backer level\u2014in fact, we recommend you do not, unless a different level has other options you want (signed copies, medallion keychains, etc). Changing your backer level does not automatically qualify you for an add-on\u2014you will still need to pledge additional funds for additional items.\nAfter our campaign is complete, we'll send a survey to all backers through which you can identify the items you want. If you want to make sure we know your wishes, send us a message as well (Not a comment, though we'll read that too).\nSo what do you say, backers? Are you ready to march an extra few milestones with us? Because we guarantee there's more cool stuff waiting for us down this road.

We include short stories, flash fiction, poetry, and interviews of different small press and indie writers alike as we believe many of them have a story to tell just as much as the big guys. Because of this and the fact that we know readers love to read, we want to include at least 30 submissions (15 short stories, 10 flash fiction, 5 poetry) per issue! However, our current goal has it only sitting at about 18 (10 short stories, 5 flash fiction, 3 poetry) submissions. We would love to do more than that so we are coming here to ask you guys for help.

Thus we will always be fair and open to the community in reaching out to those who think they will never be good enough and show them that they can compete with the big dogs if they just keep working at it.\nOur Team\nAmber: Our Founder of Dreams Eternal and runner of the Facebook page.

He helped Amber get the ball rolling when it came to crunching numbers and bouncing off ideas to make sure everything was perfect.\nJake: Editor.

And a group of us started to wonder if it was possible for drinks to not only taste amazing, but also be functional and nutritious. A small team called a Torani Mix Tank set out on this challenge.  (Spoiler alert... we found an answer.) \nTo support innovative ideas, we created Mix Tank as a way for anyone at Torani to bring BIG and small ideas to life. \nFolks, We Have A Winner!\nWinning Name & Label\n *click the image above for more details.\n *click the image above for more details...\nIntroducing Plus Ups!\nPlus Ups are mix-ins that add function + flavor to your favorite drinks. Simply add a scoop to your smoothie or other favorite drink. They're made from ground up, real ingredients. They're simple to use. And they're natural. And\u2026 fun!\nWe crafted Plus Ups so that cafes can serve delicious blended drinks with added benefits, but without the challenges of perishable items and difficult drink prep. Then we got thinking\u2026 WE want this at home. Why not give everyone an easy way to create delicious, nutritious and functional beverages?\nWhat\u2019s in the lineup? \nEach Plus Up flavor will come in a 16 ounce container with an easy single serving scoop, for a total of 14 servings for 14 delicious drinks! We have 3 flavors lined up so far:\nHarvest Veggie Plus Up lets you add 1\u00bd servings of veggies to your regular smoothie. Packed with carrots, sweet potatoes, butternut squash and a dash of cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger. So far, our favorite drink is mixed into a Mango Smoothie.\nGreen Veggie Plus Up gives you the power to sip down a whole cup of green veggies including spinach, zucchini, celery and parsley. A Fruit and Green Veggie Smoothie is fruit forward, yummy, healthy and really green.\nGreen Coffee Bean Plus Up turns your favorite smoothies and iced drinks intro powerhouses of added energy, each serving provides 80mg of natural caffeine without the taste of coffee.\nHelp Us Name this Baby!

Try these out:\n\"Creating something that is delicious, nutritious AND that can work with a range of drink applications was not an easy challenge. It took more than two years but I am happy with what we\u2019ve achieved. Together with other food scientists and developers, we sampled our way through dozens of iterations to get to the right flavor profiles and ingredient specifications. We were committed to only using good quality ingredients and not taking any shortcuts with artificial flavors, colors or preservatives. It has been a pleasure creating great products that have an everyday impact with the benefits like Plus Ups.\"\nWhat happens when flavor mavens are let loose?\nAt Torani, we always challenge ourselves to find new delicious flavors, support new ideas, and find new ways to involve our community and our cafes. Everyone at Torani is encouraged to experiment and we wanted to find a way to give any great idea a chance to grow. \nMix Tanks are pop-up teams made of small groups of incredibly passionate people at Torani who have an idea that they want to try out. It's a platform for any idea to become a reality, even (especially!) if it's different from what we've done before. This is a crazy new thing for us, but when a few of us food scientists, flavor mavens and team members came up with the Plus Ups concept, everyone was excited!\nWhen we shared the idea with a few customers, they loved Plus Ups, but said it was too early and the market wasn\u2019t ready. It got us thinking\u2026 why do just a few people get to decide? If we brought Plus Ups to market the traditional way and got lots of big customers to commit, it would have been 2017 before it could come to life. That was like a million years away. So we got the green light to try something new. That's why we're here on Kickstarter, so we can find out what you think!\nWe've been family owned for three generations and we\u2019ve reimagined and innovated our business several times. Trying something new and opening this up just feels right to us.\n\"Torani has always been committed to being innovative in the world of flavor. Inside our building, we get excited over every new flavor and every new product we create. Plus Ups is a departure from our traditional products and it\u2019s just one way we are showing our commitment to innovation. Being able to take an idea from our team and then getting the chance to co-create the final product with our community and the Kickstarter community is exciting on so many levels! This effort showcases starts in a small way to democratize product innovation. And for me, it\u2019s a pretty big deal because it creates a platform for how we could all work in the future. Really cool stuff.\"\nFollow Us for Cool Updates!\n Join the Mix Tank! \nTo make Plus Ups a reality, we need your support, tell us that we are onto something (or not). Hitting the $10,000 goal will allow us to do our first pilot run and bring this to life NOW.\nIn addition to awesome rewards, if you are hungry for more, you can also be part of Plus Ups\u2019 development.  Every step of the way, you'll be able to provide input, ideas, and suggestions which will shape the final result.

Do you know a cat person who needs more time to hang out with cats in Seattle? The Seattle Kitty Kafe will be a cat caf\u00e9 where Seattleites get to mingle with cats, while also revolutionizing the way cats are adopted by providing a social way to meet cats who can be adopted. SKK has been in progress since Spring of 2014 and is now ready to invite YOU to help us take the next step! By donating to our Kickstarter, you are helping us secure the needed down payment for the loan necessary to really get this business up and running! Questions? Check out our FAQ! \nHistory \nAs you may know, a cat caf\u00e9 is a place where cats and humans alike can relax and socialize together. The world\u2019s very first cat caf\u00e9 opened in 1997 in Taiwan and over the past decade, cat cafes have spread worldwide and are now (finally) entering North America. As of now, there are over 65 cat cafes in Japan, spreading across the islands. There is one to open in Australia, one in Paris, one in Canada, and five in the United States. The first within the US was Cat Town Caf\u00e9 in Oakland California, opening on the 25th of October 2014! Since then they have spread like wildfire! \nSeattle Kitty Kafe: SKK \nSeattle Kitty Kafe is all about providing a unique and relaxing environment full of your favorite animals - cats! We will have a room of cats to play, snuggle, and relax with. Bring a friend or come relax alone, either way our cats will be happy to see you! Find yourself falling in love with a particular feline? Great news! You can adopt them through our partnership with Kitty Harbor and give them a forever home. \nWho We Are: McRae N and Jonathan H \nThis venture is a partnership among SPU grads McRae Naayers and Jonathan Hoover, both young entrepreneurs who grew up overseas before coming to the States. \n Check her out at Ignite 2014! \nVision \nThe mission of Seattle Kitty Kafe is to revolutionize the process of cat adoption, while also offering a calm environment for humans to rest and socialize. There have been studies demonstrating the health benefits for people through interaction with cats. A cat\u2019s purr not only increases blood flow, but also the serotonin and dopamine within our bodies. Seattle Kitty Kafe also hopes to revolutionize the adoption process by creating an open space without cages for customers to freely interact with the cat they may adopt. This allows the customer to fully observe the cat\u2019s personality and potential out in the open, something that can be difficult when the cat is confined to a cage. The cat room will house 9-15 cats for customers to play or snuggle with while eating, studying, or relaxing. Seattle Kitty Kafe will lease a space and build out according to health codes for both the cat space and caf\u00e9 area. Seattle Kitty Kafe will be different from other coffee shops due to our emphasis on cats and partnerships with local businesses. We will sell local merchandise, pastries, coffee, and tea from local vendors in the Seattle area. Whenever possible, our supplies, goods, and employees will come from Washington State.\nRight Now! \nSeattle Kitty Kafe is going on tour before our soft opening!\nWork within the zone on our map? \nBeginning in April 2015 and lasting only until the end of our Kickstarter on May 30th, SKK will be available in your area! From Northgate to White Center and East into Bellevue, we will be offering small kitty parties. Do you have a group who would love to hang out with three to five of our kitties for a couple of hours at your location? Energize your mornings with an a.m. spot. Schedule a lunchtime de-stress. Book a late afternoon session to help everyone wind down. \nDo you want us to bring cats to YOUR business? \n                                Call (206)432-6395 to book a 3 hour visit! \nYou provide the space and the people who want to hang out. We provide the cats and Cattendants and cover their needs\nREWARD BREAK DOWN\nEarly Access Passes (EA)  \nFor our first month, while our staff is being trained and our cats are getting used to our space, we will allow a limited amount of people early access to the caf\u00e9. This means you can come in any time we are open, sit around with a nice drink, and play with our kitties. No cats will be adoptable during this time, but you might end up getting some free drinks as our baristas train!\nOpening Party Reservations (OP)  \nOnce everyone is trained, construction is finished, and the cats are happy, we will have an opening party! This party will include those with Kickstarter reservations, all the employees, and the owners. Our party will include calming music, friendly felines, light snacks, and free drinks.\nWhat else will we have?\n  5. Local Products Seattle Kitty Kafe will sell t-shirts, art, mugs, and jewelry to anyone who may want some. Our jewelry will come from small business owners on Etsy. Each quarter, the items listed would be rotated and new Etsy sellers will be featured, providing fresh, exciting products for customers to browse.\nWhere Your Money Goes\nThe money you generously provide us will be multiplied. We recognize that this Kickstarter will simply get us started. We have several additional funding options that we are also pursuing, including participating in for SPU and the University of Washington business plan competitions. Our goal of $40,000 will need to be translated into $160,000. With a successfully funded Kickstarter, we will approach venture capital organizations and several banks that offer start up loans. Being able to demonstrate that there is a need for a cat caf\u00e9 in Seattle via a successfully funded Kickstarter will be a huge boon in helping to secure this additional funding. This will be used to lock in and finalize our location and secure the proper health permits from the city and county. Once our location is locked in, we will need to renovate the caf\u00e9 portion of the facility to meet food and animal code. This will require a significant upfront cost in order to ensure our facility is safe for you and our kitties. Talking with other caf\u00e9 owners and cat rescue managers, we\u2019ve learned these costs alone can range from $30,000 to $100,000 dependent upon the extent of the renovations necessary. After we\u2019ve completed our renovations, we will need to be inspected by the King County Health Department, which costs approximately $850. We will also need to obtain an inspection from Animal Control to ensure the facilities are safe for the kitties.\nBelow is a pie graph of the startup costs when starting a cat cafe.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith the proper funding, this plan is completely sustainable. \n\nCat cafes are still unique, thus there are few verifiable measurements pertaining to profit margins and performance in U.S. markets. Due to the earning potential, as well as the novelty of the business, Seattle Kitty Kafe expects to receive backing from several investors. We will mitigate risks by creating a well-established caf\u00e9 to sell products. Through our strong partnerships, Seattle Kitty Kafe will have quality goods to sell to any customer frequenting the caf\u00e9. We forecast our venture to break even at the 10 month mark, having $4,000 of revenue by the end of year one. With a successful Kickstarter, we will establish a viable market to raise any additional capital required. The investment risks associated with SKK consist in potential loss of part or all capital due to such things as natural disasters, severely low sales in conjunction with steeply increased prices for coffee beans, or a civil lawsuit filed. In order to protect against these liabilities, all precautions, insurance, and waivers shall be implemented. \n\nWithin the first year, Seattle Kitty Kafe will break even. The sales data for these calculations is drawn from meticulous tracking of the daily traffic for local specialty coffee shops and existing cat cafes. In order to provide the most realistic numbers possible, the data was compiled into 3 categories, minimum number of customers/half hour, maximum number/half hour, and average number per half hour at each location. Despite the disparate numbers, SKK still turns a profit that covers both variables and fixed costs. This is largely due to the Cat Room, which has no variable costs and, according to the minimum average number of folks who use it, would generate sufficient sales to turn a profit by the end of the first year.\n\nIf interested in more of the financial side of things, please email us at SeattleKittyKafe@gmail.com for more information.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "McRae Naayers\nFirst created \u00b7 2 backed\nOwner and Founder of Seattle Kitty Kafe.See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": [{"Project ends": "JUNE 1, 2015"}, {"Project launches": "APRIL 3, 2015"}]}], "comment_no": 8, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1063842951/help-us-open-seattle-kitty-kafe", "project_name": "Help Us Open Seattle Kitty Kafe!"}}, {"backer": "Angel Leigh McCoy", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Who am I?\nHello! I'm Keffy R. M. Kehrli - and I'm a science fiction & fantasy writer and editor who has been active since my first stories came out in 2009. My editing experience includes working with Shimmer Magazine from 2009 until mid-2014, where I contributed by reading submissions, and doing some line-edits. I was also involved in some of the background planning for the magazine, so I was able to see how much work goes into creating a small press SF&F zine.\nWhat is GlitterShip?\nGlitterShip is a short science fiction and fantasy podcast that will feature stories about LGBTQ characters or explore LGBTQ issues. I want GlitterShip to be the kind of podcast that features a diverse range of authors and types of short fiction, where anyone who identifies as LGBTQ or queer feels like they could be represented.\nMost LGBTQ fiction venues tend to segregate between gay, lesbian, bi, trans, or any other category. This can be difficult for readers who identify somewhere in between, who are pansexual, asexual, non-binary, or other. I want to build a podcast zine where LGBTQ SF&F reprints are collected for readers.\nHow often will episodes come out?\nEpisodes will come out twice a month (unless we hit some huge stretch goals). The episode lengths will be 30-45 minutes each.\nThe first episode will come out on April 2nd. (Frankly, it would be April 1st, but I don't want anyone to think it's a just a joke!)\nWhat will you do with the money?\n$1500 will be enough money to pay for reprint rights on approximately 8,000-10,000 words of fiction per month, or 2-4 stories depending on how many of them are flash.\nThis goal includes a little extra to cover Kickstarter fees, materials for the backer rewards, and hosting fees.\nThat sounds awesome! Can I submit a story?\nYes, you can!\nGlitterShip guidelines: CLICK HERE!\nThe basics: Right now I am only looking for short stories between 100 and 6,000 words long that have been previously published. Pay is currently 1 cent/word. \nSimultaneous submissions are ok with me (you can send your story to other reprint anthologies/magazines/podcasts while you're waiting as long as they don't mind either.\nMultiple submissions are also ok, however, please only send up to three stories at a time.\nYou do not need to identify as LGBTQ but your story must contain some LGBTQ content or characters.\nCONTRIBUTING TO THE KICKSTARTER  is completely separate from submissions. Open submissions are always 100% free as they should be, and contributing to the Kickstarter campaign will not make your story any more or less likely to be accepted.\nStretch Goals:\n$1,800: Okay, it's not a particularly large stretch, but this money would allow me to pay other people to read some of the stories. Variety for my listeners!\n$3,600: GlitterShip goes to 4 times a month. NEW! To reflect the additional fiction published, the $10 e-book level will be split into two 6 month e-books. $10 backers will get both e-books, and $5 backers will get the first volume covering the first 6 months of GlitterShip.\n$5,000: GlitterShip opens to original fiction. 1 of the monthly episodes will be an original story, and the other three episodes will be reprints. Original fiction will start at 3 cents a word payment.\n$6,000: GlitterShip doubles its original fiction. 2 of the monthly episodes will contain reprints, and 2 will contain original stories.

What is next?\nWe made our goal of $75,000 and then we reached 1000 backers, and now the numbers just keep rising - we are so grateful to everyone who has become involved thus far!\nThe wild success of the campaign and the encouragement of our backers has inspired us to set one final bold and beautiful goal - $100,000! The additional money we raise will be used to fund a series of research trips, which are vital to continuing our cutting edge work.\nYou can read more about what we will use the additional funds for down below...and please read on for more information about the project...and become a backer today!\nWhat is the Urban Death Project?\nThe Urban Death Project is a new system that utilizes the natural process of decomposition to safely and gently turn our deceased into soil. The project is creating a meaningful, equitable, and ecological alternative to existing options for the care of the dead.\nBy funding this Kickstarter Campaign, you will join people around the world who believe that:\nDeath is a remarkable human event\nOur bodies are full of life-giving potential\nThere is deep meaning in giving back to the earth after we have died\nEvery person has the right to sustainable, meaningful death care\nClick \"Back this Project\"now to join us!\nUrban Death Project facilities will be places where people can visit to connect with the deceased and with the cycles of nature.\nWhy do we need a new option for our bodies when we die?\nEvery day that we are living, we take in nutrients from the world around us. When we die, our physical bodies are full of potential, and we can give those nutrients back to the earth.\nThe problem is that our current funeral model is toxic and polluting. In the US alone, two and a half million people die each year, and 50% choose conventional burial. This means that most often, their bodies are embalmed and then buried in a casket in a concrete-lined grave in a cemetery.\nBecause of this, each year, we bury enough metal to build the Golden Gate Bridge, enough wood to build 1800 single-family homes, and enough carcinogenic embalming fluid to fill eight Olympic sized swimming pools.\nCremation, the other most popular choice, burns fossil fuels and emits about 600 million pounds of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere annually \u2013 that\u2019s the equivalent of more than 70,000 cars driving the road for a year.\nIn other words, the very last thing that most of us will do on this earth is poison it.\nWe can do so much better! Over the past three years, the Urban Death Project team has taken an inspired design idea and developed it into a system that uses the natural process of decomposition to turn our physical bodies into soil. This soil can then be used to grow new life \u2013 imagine if you could become a pine tree, a honeysuckle bush, or a field of lavender after you\u2019ve died.\nThe \"Eventually\" series by artist Iris Gottlieb is one the rewards we are offering during our Kickstarter Campaign. What would you like to become when you die?\nHow does the system work?\nAt the heart of each Urban Death Project facility is a three-story core containing our unique compost-based renewal system. Although this core is being engineered to be replicated entirely, each building that houses a core can, and should be unique, designed specifically for the neighborhood in which it resides.\nBodies are laid into woodchips at the top of the core. Over a span of weeks, they turn into nutrient-rich soil. Each Urban Death Project building will be different, designed for the community in which it resides.\nBodies of the deceased are placed inside this core by their friends and families during a ceremony. Over the span of a few months, with the help of aerobic decomposition and microbial activity, bodies decompose fully, creating a rich soil that can be used to grow new life. \nBodies are placed into the core during the laying in ceremony.\nBeyond being a system for turning our bodies into soil, the Urban Death Project is a way to create spaces in our cities where we can contemplate our place in the natural world, and say goodbye to those we love. Death is special and is as miraculous - in its own way - as birth. Thus, it deserves to be marked by ceremony and meaning.\nThe funding from this Kickstarter Campaign will be used to complete the second phase of design for this pioneering new system. Our work to date has been funded by the Echoing Green Foundation, and by donations from people like you. Thank you for supporting our project!\nFriends and family begin their loved one's transformation from human to soil by covering the body with woodchips at the top of the core.\nWhat is the science behind the Urban Death Project?\nOur bodies are made up of nitrogen, phosphorus, and calcium, and when coupled with high carbon material such as woodchips and sawdust, we turn into soil in a process called composting. What happens to a body in an Urban Death Project facility is a lot like what happens on the top six inches of the forest floor, as organic material breaks down to form precious topsoil.\nThe First Law of Thermodynamics states that neither energy nor matter can be created nor destroyed. When we die, the decomposition process breaks down the molecules in our bodies into smaller molecules and atoms, which are then incorporated into new molecules. In other words, our physical bodies are literally transformed into new substances. The system of the Urban Death Project activates this process and accelerates it with the help of carbon materials, aeration, and hydration.\nFrom Human to Soil to Tree: Our Bodies are Full of Potential.\nHas human composting been done before?\nThe scientific basis for the Urban Death Project is the research done in livestock mortality composting by Cornell University, Washington State University, and the Pennsylvania Natural Resources Conservation Service (among others). Researchers at these institutions have found that composting is a safe, sustainable, and effective way to re-purpose animal carcasses, and the process is now utilized by farmers all over the United States. There are no records of humans being composted in this way, though the practice of natural burial (without embalming, caskets or vaults) is growing in popularity in countries all over the world.\nWhen she was in graduate school for architecture, founder Katrina Spade realized the enormous potential of the livestock composting process, and she set out to modify it for the urban setting and the human experience.\nThe Urban Death Project was born.\nIs it safe to compost bodies?\nYes. Because composting creates heat, the process kills most common viruses and dangerous bacteria. The extensive research into livestock mortality composting has found that the temperature inside a functioning compost system reaches 140-160 degrees Fahrenheit, and that these high temperatures kill dangerous pathogens.\nToday, farmers use mortality composting to safely dispose of their dead livestock, as well as to control odor and runoff. The Urban Death Project is in the process of fine tuning this process to be appropriate and meaningful for humans in an urban setting.\nWe are currently working with our soil scientist advisors to better understand how heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, and prion diseases can be safely addressed within our system.\nWhat about the bones?\nBelieve it or not, bones that are not allowed to desiccate and are kept within an active compost process do decompose entirely, although they take longer than flesh to do so. We are currently working with our partners in human decomposition research to determine the exact amount of time it will take for a human skeleton to turn into soil.\nNon-organic materials such as prostheses, metal plates, or amalgam fillings will be screened out and recycled.\nWhat does deathcare have to do with social justice?\nToday, the cost of conventional burials and cremations is steadily rising, and there are many who struggle to pay for the funeral services of a loved one. We believe that beautiful, sustainable deathcare should be available to all people around the globe, regardless of their ability to pay. We at the Urban Death Project envision a world where we don\u2019t feel any pressure to buy needless consumables in order to honor our loved ones and celebrate their lives.\nThe soil created from the bodies of our deceased may be used to grow a memorial garden, or a tree.\nA movement towards better death care is happening all over the world. Organizations like the National Home Funeral Alliance, Green Burial Council, Death with Dignity, Funeral Consumers Alliance and Hospice are all part of a movement to ensure we can own our own deaths, and make them more meaningful and environmentally sustainable.\nThe Urban Death Project is a non-profit organization that is working to change the way we experience the care of our deceased and create an option which is available to all people, regardless of their economic status.\nWe aren\u2019t just creating a new system that turns bodies into soil \u2013 we are striving for an entirely new paradigm of death care. We are creating a new model where people are treated equally as they are folded back into the earth\u2019s embrace. It is an exciting time to be alive!\nWe are part of a wondrous and miraculous ecosystem. These pen and ink prints are part of the \"Eventually\" series by artist Iris Gottlieb, and are offered as one of our rewards during our Kickstarter Campaign.\nHow does religion fit into all of this?\nThe Urban Death Project fills a niche, providing an alternative method for the care of our dead that is designed for the density of the city and envisioned on a neighborhood scale. The architecture of each Urban Death Project facility is meant to be inclusive of all faiths and provide the space to gather, pray, and mourn.\nIt is important to note that an Urban Death Project facility is not simply a system for turning our bodies into soil. It is also a space for the contemplation of our place in the natural world, and a ritual to help us say goodbye to our loved ones by connecting us with the cycles of nature.\nQuite simply, for many, this option will be deeply spiritual \u2013 an ecological, productive, and beautiful thing to do with our physical bodies after we have died.\nWhat have you done so far?\nThe Urban Death Project began as a conceptual solution to a big problem when founder and director Katrina Spade was earning her Masters degree in Architecture at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Katrina spent two years designing a system and a prototype facility that would turn bodies into soil and support the living as they grieved.\nAfter graduating, Katrina continued to spend nights and weekends working on the project so that she could bring it to the next stage of development and find funding to continue her work.\nIn July of 2014, Katrina was awarded a Climate Change Fellowship from Echoing Green, a foundation that provides seed-stage funding and supports emerging leaders who are trying to bring about large-scale social change. Since then, the Urban Death Project has grown into a thriving organization with an audacious mission to change the very landscape of death care.\nIn the past year, the project has made partnerships with people and organizations who will help us realize this mission. From funeral directors to human decomposition researchers to engineers, these experts have brought their skills and determination to the table and are contributing their design time, legal expertise, research, and industry knowledge to the project.\nIn the past year, we\u2019ve also completed a wildly successful outreach campaign, spreading the word about the potential of this exciting new system via social media, our extensive network, and also via the press. As a result, we\u2019ve heard from people all over the world \u2013 from South Africa to the Netherlands to the United Kingdom to China.\nWe are so excited about this Kickstarter Campaign! Besides helping raise the funds we need to do this work, every single new urban Death Project backer helps us illustrate the enormous collective desire for this new option in death care.\nPlease click \"Back this Project\" to join us now!\nWhat do we need to do next?\nWith the funding from this campaign, we will complete the second phase of design development for our unique core system, including detailing of the aeration and hydration systems, the material screening and finishing systems, and the structural design of the core. We will create a new 3-D model of the core system and prepare a set of engineering drawings, all this adding to the tremendous momentum that has been building over the past few years.\nOur goal is to build the first Urban Death Project facility in the city of Seattle, WA and then move on to help these facilities get built all over the world. If we surpass our goal of $75,000, we will begin designing the toolkit that will help individuals, municipalities, and organizations plan Urban Death Project facilities in their neighborhoods and we will begin to work with their communities to build them.\nWith your help, we will create a new alternative that is deeply meaningful, ecologically beneficial, and worthy of the incredible human event that we all share.\n\"Life begets life.

Thank you for your support!\nWhat will the additional money help you do?\nRecently we entered into an exciting partnership with Western Carolina University\u2019s Forensic Osteology Research Station (FOReSt). Together, we\u2019ve begun trials to determine the timeframe and best practices for turning a body into nutrient rich soil. This work has never been done before, and it\u2019s crucial to the development of the Urban Death Project.\nThe funds raised by our new goal of $100,000 will directly help us advance this research. During my last trip to FOReSt, we set up two initial experiments in human composting. It was an incredible experience, and I am deeply grateful to the people who donated their bodies to help us create a new option in death care. \nWith the funding from this new goal, we can take our research to the next level, and we are excited to share it with you! Additional money raised will pay for the cost of my travel to the hills of North Carolina, for the materials we will use to compost the donated bodies, and for field supplies such as temperature probes and moisture meters. When the trip is over, I will send a video \u2018Report Back\u2019 to all backers of the campaign, so that you will be able to see the results that your pledges helped create. \nWe are really glad to be able to share this adventure with you. Together, we are creating a new paradigm of death care.\nClick Back this Project now. And THANK YOU!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf we meet our Kickstarter goal of $75,000, we will complete the second phase of design and engineering for the Urban Death Project composting system. The main challenge for us in completing this goal is having enough time to do so. Therefore, the biggest risk to our backers is that the project takes longer than we expect. \n\nKatrina Spade, founder and director of the Urban Death Project, will be the lead project manager on the second phase of the design. Her work experience as a designer and project manager means that she understands a project timeline very well, and has a real sense of what it takes to get the work done within the specified time frame. In addition, Katrina will continue to rely on the incredible community of people who have dedicated their time to help the project move forward from day to day, week to week, and month to month.\n\nIn terms of reward fulfillment, we were careful to give ourselves plenty of time to get those stickers, art prints, and t-shirts out to all of our amazing backers. Caitlin Doughty and Katrina Spade will work directly with all of our $7500 level backers to determine the best timing for their special \u201cFuture of Death Care\u201d visits.

Join this Kickstarter campaign to fund the first three issues of FRESH ROMANCE, and get exclusive rewards in addition to becoming one of our first subscribers. With FRESH ROMANCE and our future projects, Rosy Press brings romance comics into the 21st century.\nThe first issue features sundry stories ranging from a clandestine, queer high school love affair to an impeccably researched and illustrated Regency-era romance. In addition to three forward-looking romances, each issue of FRESH ROMANCE delivers a relationship advice column by a quartet of divorced writers, behind-the-scenes art coverage, and a fashion report. Thanks to our ongoing anthology format, the kinds of stories we feature will be constantly evolving. The magazine will be R-rated, so while not all of the individual chapters or stories will be racy, there will be some adult content. Our goal is to bring avid comics readers and those new to comics together to enjoy the romance genre.\nWith talented creators on board like Kate Leth and Arielle Jovellanos with Amanda Scurti, Sarah Vaughn and Sarah Winifred Searle, and Sarah Kuhn and Sally Jane Thompson with Savanna Ganucheau, FRESH ROMANCE forges a new future for romance comics with modern characters, stories and a wide array of genres. Each month's issue of FRESH ROMANCE will have three full color comics stories, some of which are 10 pages long and can be enjoyed in a single issue, and some of which are much longer. Each story will also be released in its own ebook collection after it has run in FRESH ROMANCE.\nThese stories will remain creator-owned, yet a big part of the FRESH ROMANCE budget will be spent to pay the creators a page rate and royalties. Paying creators fairly is a cornerstone of the Rosy Press business model; we wouldn't exist without the hard work of creators, so we firmly believe they should be compensated fairly and retain control over their work. For every $10,000 we go over our goal, every single creator currently signed on to publish a story with Rosy Press will get a 15% page rate bump (so, at $48,000 everyone would get a 30% page rate bump and at $58,000 everyone would get a 45% page rate bump, etc).\nWith its digital platform, FRESH ROMANCE can reach a diverse set of readers. FRESH ROMANCE is the comics answer to the popular modern romance novel, and can be digitally delivered to anyone, anywhere, anytime. Content will be available in a variety of digital formats: via ComiXology or as a PDF, CBR, or ePub file, and will always be DRM-free. Unlike their real-world counterparts, FRESH ROMANCE stories never end \u2013 they will later be published as ebook collections.\nJoin our conversation!

But it\u2019s a raw jewel, and we will now try to show you why and how.\nTarot Fundamentals, the first book in a series of three, is the founding stone of this project.\nThis volume has, of course, a lot of information useful to beginners, but it's also filled with interesting content for Tarot experts. The three volumes have a progression, that we can synthesize like this:\n \"Fundamentals\" doesn't just cover the basics: it will be a stand-alone book, one of the more complete books ever published about Tarot. The other two volumes, Experience and Compendium, that we hope we'll be able to publish if the funding of Fundamentals is successful, will build on that and travel deeper and wider into Tarot knowledge.\nWho is Lo Scarabeo?\nBorn in 1987 in Torino, Italy, Lo Scarabeo is now a leading international company in the mind, body and spirit health publishing, with a main focus on Tarot publishing. Lo Scarabeo is one of the most important Tarot publishers in the world.\nTarot decks from Lo Scarabeo are printed in several major languages, including English, Italian, German, French, Spanish, Russian and many others. They are easily recognizable by their unique illustration and excellence in every detail.\nPlease join us in a short visit to our offices in this video:\nWHAT YOU GET\n\nA 560 pages volume, full color, 190x230 mm (7.5 x 9 inches), softcover.\nYou can look at the table of contents for Tarot Fundamentals here (please note this table of contents is not final and might be adjusted before actually printing the book):\nCLICK HERE TO SEE THE TABLE OF CONTENTS\nAnd you can read, RIGHT NOW, a FULL CHAPTER, to get a taste of what you'll get by helping to fund our project:\nCLICK HERE\nor click on the sample page:\n This is another sample page from chapter 6 (no link on this one).\nWe're very excited about this project and we would like to make it nicer and better with your help... let's make it happen together!\nSasha Graham\nFor Sasha, tarot is life, magic is alive and signs are everywhere if you know how to look.\nAfter receiving her BA in Literature and Religion at Hunter College, Sasha began her tarot work. She opened a private reading practice. She quickly became a sought after reader for the fashion and media set, becoming a staple at Fashion's Night Out and serving clients including Burt's Bees, M. Missoni and Christian Louboutin.\nSasha conceived and produced tarot events at The Metropolitan Museum of Art and The Morgan Library. She worked behind the scenes with curators and educators. Rare Visconti, Marseille and Minchiate cards along with uncut Italian card sheets were unveiled. These treasures, previously shuttered in museum archives and unavailable to the public, were examined and considered in a modern context.\nSasha is most proud of her Tarot Outreach Program. it was the first ever of its kind and was developed for NYC's at-risk, inner city youth. Working with kids who were transitioning out of the foster care system, Sasha used tarot and symbol as catalyst for nurturing personal intuition. \nSasha and her tarot books have been featured in documentaries and media outlets such as Sirius XM Radio, The Wall Street Journal, The Daily News and appeared on the cover of Crain's New York Business. She appeared regularly as a guest on the WPIX Channel 11 Morning News, reading tarot for pop culture topics and celebrities.\nSasha, her husband and daughter split their time between Manhattan and the eerily gothic, \"Jane Eyresque\" landscape of upstate New York. She is working on her third book for Llewellyn, due out in May of 2016.\nBarbara Moore\nIn the early 1990s, at a party, someone put a tarot deck in Barbara's hands.\nShe's held on tight ever since. Tarot provides just enough structure so that we don't get lost as we explore the mysteries, plumb our dark corners, and find our paths in the dark woods.\nBarbara has been reading and writing for as long as she can remember. She's published a number of books on tarot, including Tarot for Beginners, Tarot Spreads, The Steampunk Tarot, The Gilded Tarot, The Mystic Dreamer, and Tarot of the Hidden Realm. Writing is solitary work and is relieved by teaching tarot at conferences around the world.Barbara also loves working with clients, using the tarot to provide guidance and insight.\nMark McElroy\nMark is the author of Putting the Tarot to Work, Taking the Tarot to Heart, What's in the Cards for You?, I Ching for Beginners and The Absolute Beginner's Guide to Tarot.He calls Tarot \"the ultimate visual brainstorming tool,\" and shares techniques designed to help others ask better questions, see more options, and achieve their goals.\nHe holds a B.A. and M.A. in creative writing and composition from the Center for Writers at the University of Southern Mississippi. He has more than two decades of experience as a public speaker and corporate trainer. Today, he works as a writer, voice actor, and creativity consultant. \n\n\nMarcus Katz\n\nMarcus has been working with and teaching tarot for over thirty years.  He co-founded the Tarosophy Tarot Association, the world\u2019s largest professional tarot Association, with Tali Goodwin in 2009. His first book, Tarosophy, was called a \u201cmajor contribution\u201d to tarot by Rachel Pollack and his book co-authored with Tali, Around the Tarot in 78 Days, won the COVR Award in 2013. He lives in the Lake District with his wife, fellow author and editor, Brina, and magician\u2019s cat, Alex.\nTali Goodwin \n\nTali has researched and written about the tarot for many years and is credited with bringing the long-hidden Waite-Trinick Tarot to publication in Abiding in the Sanctuary (2012).  She has co-authored innovative teaching books such as Tarot Flip, Tarot Life, and others which are regularly in the top ten best-selling tarot books on Kindle. Her book co-authored with Marcus, Secrets of the Waite-Smith Tarot has been described as \"astonishing\" by Mary K. Greer. She lives in the Lake District with her partner, leading Astrologer and author Lyn Birkbeck, and dog, Rufus Oakapple.\n\nGiordano Berti\n\nis an Italian writer, and one of the greatest international experts on the connection between art and esotericism. He is one of the most respected authorities regarding the history of Tarot.\n\nRiccardo Minetti\nis the chief editor of Lo Scarabeo for Tarot. He has worked with Tarot since he was very young (he still is in his heart) and had been involved in the creation of over 100 Tarot decks and books.\nSome words from the authors and other personalities in the Tarot world\nThis is the full video with extended contents by Erik C. Dunne, Marcus Katz and Tali Goodwin.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLo Scarabeo has been publishing books and Tarot for 27 years, and River Horse already has a positive record of Kickstarter projects, so we are really confident this book will be printed. \nOf course, there are always risks and challenges to be considered:\n\n1. Possible delays from the printer. That's always a possibility. This is why we estimate we'll be able to deliver the books by October-November. We will post a timeline soon and keep it updated.\n\n2. Shipping delays. We will try to ship the books keeping a reasonable compromise between shipping costs and timing. Shipments in the US and Canada will be handled by Lo Scarabeo's partner and distributor for North America, Llewellyn Inc. This will ensure a closer monitoring to North American shipments, to minimize delay risks. We will directly handle and monitor shipments to European countries and the rest of the world.\n\n3. Technical problems. It's probably the biggest book ever by Lo Scarabeo but we're confident in our graphic department. There should be no problem at all.\n\n4. External contributors. Some stretch goal will require external writers to send us additional text. Delay in getting these texts from the external authors might reflect in a delay to the whole project as well. Thankfully, we chose professional and dedicated people to write this additional content, but they might be delayed for unexpected reasons.\n\nAnyway, we don't anticipate major problems and we have 27 years of experience about how to handle the unexpected!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #21", "update_userinfo": "Highlander: The Board Game by River Horse, now live!", "update_content": "Hi everyone,\nOur latest Kickstarter, a board game based on the classic 1986 movie 'Highlander', was launched a little while ago and has been a great success!

And so we set out to produce an anthology where women were involved in all aspects of the creative process, from the artists to the authors, the editors to the project managers. Women of all ages and races, abilities and physical attributes, unified by a love for art and literature.\nIn January 2014, we ran a Kickstarter that was successful beyond our wildest dreams. In just one month, the Athena's Daughters campaign raised $44,350 \u2014 521% of our initial goal. During that campaign we achieved stretch goals that not only funded a companion anthology, Apollo's Daughters (stories about women, but written by men), but also funded the production of a second volume... Athena's Daughters 2 which would have an open call for submissions from any woman who wished to be included. Silence in the Library Publishing immediately began the work of putting together this second collection full of stories about a diverse assortment of female protagonists, all written by women.\nSubmissions for this volume opened in June, and we were flooded with great stories. After a difficult deliberation, we accepted stories by: Tiffani Angus, Antha Ann Adkins, Sarah Brand, Elizabeth Bridges, Megan Chee, Liz Colter, Janice Croom, Ellen Goodlett, Emily Lavin Leverett, Alison J. McKenzie, Megan O'Russell, Tish Pahl, Carrie Ryan, Rori Shay, and Tess Tabak. We'll tell you more about each author below.\nBecause payment to authors, artists, editors, and layout professionals has already been completely covered by the previous Athena's Daughters Kickstarter, we can keep the initial goal very low\u2014enough to cover the costs of printing and shipping. This will allow us to set some really cool stretch goals at very low levels. \nAs we hit stretch goals we will be adding more stories (and more art!) to our anthology. Our stretch goal authors are Jordan Frederick, Lindsay Kitson, Nicole Givens Kurtz, Gerri Leen, Janine A. Southard, and JY Yang. Additionally, backers will receive extra stories and other free downloads as we hit these goals.\nThere is a whole team of us here at Silence in the Library that will be working to bring this anthology to life. Kelli Neier created the cover and will be doing the print and eBook layout, as well as managing the Kickstarter campaign. Ginger Breo has created all the internal art attached to each and every story. Autumn Frederickson will be doing a special cover for the print version of the book, if we hit her stretch goal. Tanya Spackman will be the copyeditor, and last but not least, Maggie Allen and Janine Spendlove will be the content editors and overall project managers.\n\"Athena's Daughters 2\" theme lyrics written by Chris Russell:\nSomething romantic\nNothing pedantic\nSomething for everyone\nAthena's Daughters 2!\nSomething that's tragic\nSomething with magic\nSomething for everyone\nAthena's Daughters 2!\nSomething that's grim,\nSomething that's Greek!\nOk, we're sold!\nOur Interest is piqued!\nStunning surprises!\nNear missed demises.\nStories determined to delight!\nFairytales and death plots!\nOuter space and robots!\nLove stories and chases!\nWe covered all the bases!\nPanderers!\nPhilanderers!\nCupidity!\nTimidity!\nMistakes!\nFakes!\nRhymes!\nCrimes!\nWriters!\nFighters!\nArtists!\nFarces!\nMaybe a curse, written in verse,\nAnd a few happy endings, of course!\nGoodness and badness,\nPanic and madness--\nPlease help our stories see the light!\nDon't wait 'til tomorrow\nBack the book tonight!\nFirst 100 Backers - Will receive a free digital download of an exclusive story by Elizabeth Bridges, \"Run\" which is the prequel to \"Breathe\" her story in AD2.\nFirst 200 Backers - Will receive a free digital download of Janine Spendlove's short stories \u201cGirl\u201d and \u201cWhite Flag\u201d from the Songs of the Seasons series.\n$5,000 - ACHIEVED - We will add the short story \u201cRed is the Colour of Mother Dirt\u201d by JY Yang.\nJY Yang is a lapsed scientist, a former journalist, and a short story writer.

When Lindsay was twenty one, she was formally diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome, a mild form of Autism. She started writing when she was thirteen, but actually started telling stories at was five years old in a friend's basement, using cardboard boxes as props. Her parents and teachers complained that she always had her head in the clouds, and they were right. After researching aviation for a work in progress, she realized writing about it was never going to be enough.

Since then, Autumn and Freddy have hit the comic-convention circuit, traveling from coast to coast whilst peddling their wares. Crayon scribbles of unicorns gave way to stylized paintings of caped heroes and other popular characters. Her ever growing brigade of watercolor Lemonheads has become increasingly popular with children and adults alike.\n\nIn addition to commissioned art and conventions, Autumn still continues to work on a personal body of illustrations that draws from numerous mythological and fairytale sources as well as her own, personal brand of humor.

By uncovering an artifact whose powers they don\u2019t fully understand, these remarkable kids will defy the laws of Nature and somehow interact between two planes of reality: life and death. Their curiosity will trigger a series of unexpected events that will get them involved in a government conspiracy and a mysterious U.S. Army general with his own nefarious plans.\nWelcome to Crossing Souls, an old-school action-adventure game with just a touch of RPG elements - coming to PC, Mac, and Linux.\nOur initial goal is to bring Crossing Souls for Windows, Mac and Linux. We'd love to see the game on console as well! Check out this update for more information about PS4 and VITA ports.\nCrossing Souls is an action-adventure with RPG touches set in a classic 80's style. You will play in a orthogonal 2D view slightly similar to classics like The Legend of Zelda.\nThe player will be able to control five different characters, mixing each one's unique abilities and weapons to overcome all the challenges and obstacles ahead of them. You will explore lots of places, interact with hundreds of NPC from different periods of time, solve puzzles, look for secret places and treasures, and fight against enemies in order to save your loved ones.\nThe band of accidentally heroes will have an artifact of invaluable power: the DUAT stone. Through this artifact they will be able to connect to the death plane and the thousands of souls that exist there, awaiting their trial to be able to finally rest in peace.\nBut, be careful, no one knows what repercussions the use of this stone may have - is it as harmless as it seems?\nChris: The leader of the group. He's the one we all identify with. A normal boy that hides a limitless courage. He's crazy about Charlie, even though he's not very good at demonstrating it.\nAbility: Very agile, he can climb and move faster than everyone.\nWeapons: a baseball bat.\nCharlie: A girl with character, she always has the last word, and she's usually right.\nAbility: She's a great pitcher. She throws objects with a very high precision.\nWeapons: Skipping Rope\nBig Joe: He doesn't believe in Matthew's scientific follies nor in fantasy mysteries. According to him, a bit of brute force fixes everything.\nAbility: He can move all kind of huge objects with his strength. He fears nothing.\nWeapons: His big hand and a garbage bin lid that he uses as a shield.\nMath: The cleverest guy of the group. Higher IQ than average. He uses his own toys and electronic knowledge to invent all kind of useful tools.\nAbility: Decipher encrypted codes and electronic puzzles. Shooting at a long distance.\nWeapons: Hyper gun and a laptop with a hacking plug.\nKevin: Chris' little brother, funny and naughty. He doesn't take anything seriously, but he knows when to obey to his older brother when things get serious.\nAbility: He's very stealthy and he hides where nobody else can.\nWeapons: Slingshot.\n\u00b7 EXPLORE \nDiscover a marvellous and wide world. Explore your town and its surroundings, get lost in the woods and discover hidden and unbelievable places. The game will take you around your city\u2019s outskirts where you will discover new places as the story goes.\n\u00b7 THINK\nFace the most unusual challenges. Push boxes, use switches, break a code and solve puzzles in both living and death planes. Mix the group abilities with the DUAT stone to overcome all the obstacles you will find.\n\u00b7 TALK\nCommunicate with those around you. You live in a busy town of California. Talk with their citizens! Everyone has an anecdote or clue for you, although some of them may refuse to help you unless you help them first...\n\u00b7 FIGHT\nHave fun fighting against a soldier or\u2026 a dinosaur. The game uses a simple and straight fighting mechanic where fun is the important thing. Besides, each character has its own style and weapon. Choose whichever suits better for you or the situation! Fight against enemies of both planes: ghost warriors, evil huge spiders or soldiers from a mysterious army.\n\u00b7 DIE\nThere is something more than what you can see at a glance. This adventure will take you to a parallel plane where you will have to interact with their existing souls. You will have to use the DUAT Stone whenever it\u2019s needed to find both friends and foes. But take care, its power is unknown yet.\nIn 1945, the archeologist Dr. Carter Jones discovers a strange tomb on a secret mission to Cairo funded by the US government. Inside this tomb, he finds a strange small pyramidal rock on a excavated lectern in the rock with a lot of puzzling hieroglyphs. \nYou will have to use it wisely to collect clues or solve some puzzles. Thanks to it, you will be able to interact with NPC from different times who can help you in your adventure. The character holding the Duat Stone will be the one we\u2019ll be controlling in the dead zone and it\u2019s the only one who can see the ghosts.\nAlong your adventure you will visit all kind of places inside the town: houses, stores, arcade, library\u2026 In the outskirts: the junkyard, the woods, caves\u2026 You will also even have to infiltrate in the Major Oh Rus\u2019 maximum security facilities created to carry out his evil plan.\nFormer Colonel Beringer and self proclaimed Major Oh Rus, backed by the American Secret Service, has recruited near one million of dead people from all time for what he calls \u201cODWW\u201d (One Day World War). From his underground headquarters somewhere in California, he plans to annihilate every interfering power between his path to glory.\nMajor Oh Rus has achieved a lot of power at the highest levels of government and the army so he won\u2019t hesitate in use them against you to stop whatever may put his mission at risk. Even the police will try to find you so, take care!\nThe ghost zone is also tricky in Crossing Souls\u2026 How will it be to face already dead enemies? You will find foes from every ages, like indigenous or cowboys, even prehistoric enemies such as dinosaurs.\nSecondary characters will have lots of diversity. Thanks to the Duat Stone, you will find vikings, troglodytes, American Civil War soldiers, Indigenous, dinosaurs, historical characters, unknown creatures to mankind and much more. Of course, we will also meet town citizens (parents and relatives of our group of friends) which sometimes will make them to have a hard time.\nThese small videos will expand the game\u2019s plot as if it were a tv show from the epoch.\nWe really want them to be like the TV shows you used to watch on the 80s television, such as Teenwolf, Saint Seiya, He-Man, TMNT\u2026 Luckily, we have a great team with a lot of experience and love for this sort of animation to overcome this challenge.\nThe game we take more elements from is clearly The Legend of Zelda. Dungeons, a vast map, exploration, camera perspective and puzzles are elements in this game series and so will be our game. \nHowever, we are looking for a cinematic touch with a more linear plot, so that the player won\u2019t miss the storyline at any moment. Our battles will also be more dynamic than the ones used to be seen in the most classic Zelda games, as the player must switch between the characters to use different objects and strategies.\nFinal Fantasy Series is our clear reference when attempting to create a charismatic group and telling a deep and intertwined history. Our characters will have a very defined personality, which one will evolve over time according to events.\nCrossing Souls is an ode to our childhood, to quirky hairstyles, to funky t-shirts, to adventure films and cassettes\u2026 but, above all, it\u2019s a tribute to consoles and video games... Those games that gave us so many unforgettable hours of fun.\nEverything in the 80s had its own soul and we bet you can remember more than one track from that decade. That's why we believe that music is an essential part in Crossing Souls. One of the main aspects of the 80s was its funky music and we want to teleport you there with style.\nThe great Timecop1983 (Soundcloud) will be in charge of creating this unique atmosphere with his amazing ability to create 80s tracks. Here you can find some samples of his music:\n                                                                                                             Next to him will be a promising young of German music. Chris is very young but he already composes like the masters. You can listen to their music on their Soundcloud. Chris is composing some orchestral tracks for the game which will remind you some Spielberg's films:\nCLICK IMAGE to see the full list of add-ons!\n                                                                                                             COLLABORATORS\nWe've been working on Crossing Souls for a bunch of months now and we've reached the point where we need your support.\n\nWe are a humble team that have been working hard to become game makers because this is our life! We're settled on a very very small attic from the beauty city of Seville, Spain. We've been covering the development costs ourselves, but if we want to make a great game we need to do the things right. We will use the money as follows:\nWe will have to pay 5% to Kickstarter and another 5% to Amazon Payments. 21% goes to Spanish taxes.\nWe've estimated that about 11% will cover the production of the rewards.\nThe studio rent will be about 8% of the total.\nThe rest will be used to develop the game, including the music and SFX.\nFourattic is partnering with indie game label Devolver Digital on the marketing, promotion, and distribution of Crossing Souls. With their help we will be able to reach more players, press, and platforms than we would on our own. Additionally, the Devolver Digital team will help with localization of Crossing Souls into many more languages and QA testing to help ensure it works as smoothly as possible on more system configurations upon release.\nAll funds raised via Kickstarter remain ours for development and Devolver Digital will handle marketing, event, and other activities to promote Crossing Souls. Through Kickstarter, Fourattic may be able to raise more funds than a publisher might provide, create a larger community for Crossing Souls, and allow our fans to be a part of development through interaction with the team and select rewards to create pieces of the game itself.\nTiers\nClick HERE to see the full list of REWARDS!\n$5 - THE BROKE ASS\n$15 - THE CONFORMIST\n$20 - THE BOOKSWORM\n$25 - THE BUDDY (limited)\n$30 - THE GAMER\n$40 - THE ARTIST\n$55 - THE FAN+ (limited)\n$65 - THE FAN\n$80 - THE STYLISH (limited)\n$125 - THE COLLECTOR (limited)\n$185 - THE READER (limited)\n$250 - THE SHY (limited)\n$400 - THE RASCAL (limited)\n$620 - THE CREATIVE (limited)\n$850 - DA BOSS (limited)\n$5,000 - BEST FRIENDS IN THE WORLD (limited)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAny project has its own risks and we know that developing a game is not an easy task.

I began college at the University of Chicago in the late 60s, but later transferred to the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) to study photography. Today I teach at RISD, and have been taking photos, publishing books, and teaching for the last four decades. Yikes! \nThe book I\u2019m asking you to help fund is called HISTORIES: TALES FROM THE 70s. It will showcase some of my favorite work taken from 1970-79. I originally studied history at the University of Chicago, but was drawn to photography because it was more fun and interesting to interact with real subjects out in the world, than to sit in a library studying the past. Despite changing majors (and schools), in some ways my focus did not change at all. Rather than an historian with written/typed notes, I became an historian with a camera. My teacher Harry Callahan at RISD encouraged me to \u201cshoot what you love.\u201d So I did.\nHISTORIES: TALES FROM THE 70s will chronicle a time when I was photographing almost everything I could find. Anything that smacked of history, especially cultures that might disappear or change, was fair game: stock car racing, horse racing, boxing, old rural routes through Rhode Island and Massachusetts, country and blues musicians in Nashville and elsewhere, and my close family and friends were just a few of my subjects.\nThis Kickstarter project aims to fund the first in a series of books, all called HISTORIES, that will contain images through all the decades that I have been making work. Some of this work has been published in individual books over the years, but there are so many other photographs that have never been seen before. These are the pictures that I want to include in HISTORIES: TALES FROM THE 70s. The images show a cross-section of America at the time: big cars, plaid pants, long hair, and all. I hope that this will serve as a chronicle of the past \u2013 a snapshot of the time and people who were not famous or rich but were a fundamental part of the culture of the 70s.  \nThe two videos included, some photographs below, and these websites highlight much of my 70s work: \nRACING DAYS, the people and places of thoroughbred horse racing. www.racingdaysbook.com\nHONKY TONK, country music musicians, fans, and venues. www.honkytonkbook.com\nCLOSE RELATIONS, family and friends from the 70s. www.closerelationsbook.com\nSPEEDWAY72, portraits and cars of stock-car racing in 1972. www.speedway72.com\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHenry is also author of several widely used textbooks, including BLACK & WHITE PHOTOGRAPHY: A BASIC MANUAL, BEYOND BASIC PHOTOGRAPHY: A TECHNICAL MANUAL, AND DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY: A BASIC MANUAL. He is professor of photography at Rhode Island School of Design.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*Photogravure - An old-school, hand-pulled print, using a photo-mechanical printmaking process whereby a copper plate is coated with a light-sensitive gelatin tissue, exposed to a film positive, and then etched.\n**Archival Pigment - A museum-grade, fine-art inkjet print made on premium paper with pigmented inks that offer a high-degree of longevity.\n***Silver Gelatin - An old-school, hand-pulled photographic print made with chemicals on long-lasting fiber paper.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThanks to John Spellos of Anthropy Arts for the use of footage from his film on Henry.

It was an industry town with the Grand Ole Opry, a live radio show, as the primary performing venue. But there were a few old honky tonks around, like the Merchant Caf\u00e9, where a couple could get hammered and show their moves, with no inhibition.\nDolly Parton and Porter Wagoner, Symphony Hall, Boston, MA 1972\nBefore Dolly became a star, she was a singer for Porter\u2019s Wagon Masters (1967-1974). I took this picture backstage for The Boston Phoenix, the local alternative weekly. This shot was taken in the same session that produced a better-known photo of Dolly alone. As an aside, the interviewers were Marian Leighton and Ken Irwin of Rounder Records, a label Dolly recorded for more than 30 years later.\n*Dolly and Porter is a reward print\nBoxing at the Harvard Club, Boston, MA, 1977\nMale Harvard alumni used to gather annually in the ballroom of their mansion to eat roast beef, smoke cigars, and jeer at boxers pounding each other. Racial epitaphs were heard; business deals were sealed. I shot this picture for a book I was working on with writer Brendan Boyd, which was never published. Ten years later, Brendan and I did collaborate on RACING DAYS.\nJerry Lee Lewis, Ramada Inn, East Boston, MA, 1975\nThis stage shot of wildman Jerry Lee in action during the second set of a lounge show. He walked out of the first set after two songs because the crowd was too loud. This was the country side of Jerry Lee\u2014the time of \u201cWhat\u2019s Made Milwaukee Famous Has Made a Loser Out of Me,\u201d not of \u201cGreat Balls of Fire.\u201d I made the picture for Country Music Magazine and, of course, me.\n *Jerry Lee is a reward print\nChristine, Boston, MA, 1972\nThis photo from my book CLOSE RELATIONS shows a sweet, skeptical baby against a lot of fun patterns. But to me it\u2019s a coming of age picture\u2014the first baby I knew who was not part of my family. I was 25 years old, building my own family of friends. This photo of Christine is in the collection of the Portland Museum of Art.\n*Christine is a reward print\nMom, Chammie and Studley, Kitchen, Newton, MA, 1971\nHere, mom is pictured with her dog Chammie (left) and Chammie\u2019s cousin Studley, my sister\u2019s dog. My mom loved poodles and had eight in her lifetime, all named Chammie to help her remember their names. This photo was my first prize winner ever. A second in the portrait category for The Real Paper, another local alternative weekly. For my efforts, I scored a 105mm, f2.8 Nikon lens.\nCarrie, Fort Hill, Roxbury, MA, 1975\nI know very little about Carrie except she was a cousin of the fine soul singer Garnet Mimms and vocalist in the band of a friend of a friend. And that she fits nicely onto a lounger. I took this shot after photographing the entire band. We went inside and took some more personal pictures. Sometimes the pictures that last are the ones least expected or planned.\n*Carrie is a reward print\nSteve Cauthen, Saratoga Race Course, Saratoga Springs, NY, 1977\nThe last winner of the Triple Crown was a horse named Affirmed in1978. Steve Cauthen was the rider. He was 18-years old at the time. Not long after, he moved to England and rode champion horses for Arabian princes and cut country music records. This picture speaks to a jockey\u2019s strength\u2014the hands that guide their mounts to the finish line.\nSecretariat Takes a Bath, Claiborne Farms, Paris, KY, 1989\nTaken months before he passed, the greatest racehorse ever spent his last 15 years \u201ccovering\u201d mares and being coddled. Alright, I know this picture was taken ten years after the 70s ended, but in 1973 Secretariat became one of only 11 horses to win the Triple Crown of Racing, so I thought he fit in here. Besides, a Kickstarter-savvy friend advised, \u201cFor rewards, offer celebrities and animals.\u201d In this picture you get both.\n*Secretariat is a reward print\nDel and Alice, Thompson Speedway, Thompson, CT, 1972\n *Del and Alice is a reward print. \nRay Jr., Thompson Speedway, Thompson, CT, 1972\nBoth of these pictures were taken in the summer between my first and second years of graduate school at RISD. I had a job as photographer for the Thompson Speedway, a stock-car track in Northern Connecticut (see video below for more), producing pictures for their weekly program. On the side, I was making pictures for myself. A print of Ray is in the collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. A print of Del and Alice is in the collection of the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA couple of years ago, I found a box of 8x10 photos in my studio. They were a selection of pictures I made in 1972 for a stock car track - the Thompson Speedway. I had totally forgotten about these pictures, and was surprised at what I saw. They were very good! No doubt better than when I took them 40 years ago. Histories. Age improves fine wine and good pictures. I showed them to my class and student Tori Roy said that her family lived nearby and knew a lot of the people at the track. We took a trip down there and made some video of the Speedway today (not much different than in \u201972) and some longtime Speedway folks looking over my photographs.\nPLAY\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMonk looks stylish in his American Apparel Honky Tonk t-shirt that he got as a $35 reward (see right-hand column).\n For color accuracy, the shirt is dark gray, the lettering white and orange.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEditing a book from an entire decade of photos presents a host of challenges. In the 1970s, I shot at least 20,000 pictures, many of which I haven\u2019t seen since I took them. Then, there\u2019s scanning the film (remember film??), Photoshop work, design, printing, and shipping.\n\nI have set a very tight deadline for the project (completion in one year). In the past I have produced several books, so I know the steps that are involved. And I know there are a lot of things that could go wrong and some that definitely will. I think the best way to minimize risk is to work with first-rate production people and a top printer. In all likelihood, the book will be printed in Italy. \n \nFortunately, I am on a sabbatical from teaching this year, so I can I dedicate much of my time to this book. I feel confident I can get it done in time. And hopefully, thanks to Kickstarter backers (you!), budget won\u2019t be the obstacle it usually is.

Besides all coming from the same part of Idaho, they had another powerful commonality. Their coach.\n\"The day I met Coach Roy Bartlett and he handed me his log rolling scrapbook I felt the weight of the memories as well as his confidence in me.

It was one of the featured events at timber carnivals and lumberjack competitions in timber areas; the northeast, upper Midwest, western Canada and the Great Pacific Northwest. Due to a variety of reasons the sport faded away in north central Idaho. The mill that produced the logs and the log rolling coach, no longer uses the millpond. And for a variety of reasons, both environmental and economic, trees became harder to come by. The parks and recreation programs that once attracted hundreds of Lewiston youngsters no longer exist. \nFive time World Champion Log Roller Bette (Ellis) Jordan.\nBut at one time these world champions had their moments in the sun\u2026TV game shows\u2026Hollywood and headlines\u2026competitions in Japan\u2026 scrapbooks filled with memories, yellowed now with the passing of time.

And each was humbly pleased to be able to share this important chapter in their lives. \nNational fame came to these world champion birlers.\n                               WHY ME? \nI have personal and professional connections to the region where this story took place. I lived In Lewiston, Idaho after the log rolling boom. My first television news job was at the Lewiston, Idaho CBS affiliate. I am a video producer and former cable programming manager.\nI did the research and tracked down the women and coach Roy Bartlett. I\u2019ve made personal connections with these people. My most valued trait is my reporter\u2019s curiosity. This is how I am approaching \u201cQueens of the Roleo\u201d. Is it about log rolling? Yep. But the real story is about these four girls and how Roy Bartlett lead them to eleven world championships. It\u2019s their story. \nRoy Bartlett, former pond monkey and coach of world champion log rollers!\n WHY DOES THIS DOCUMENTARY MATTER? \nThis is a story that will be lost if we don't tell it. The film is about a culture, a town, a lumber mill, a pond monkey and four young girls who set goals and achieved them beyond their wildest dreams. \nIt is a glimpse at a moment in an obscure sport as told by the young women who took the logrolling world by storm in the 1960's. This film looks at a timber culture that no longer exists in America. How did Roy Bartlett find and nurture talent that dominated their sport on an international level? Did success go to their heads? And how did their lives turn out? They tell the story in their own words. \n     WE'RE ALREADY WINNING AWARDS!\nProducer Dave Jones accepts \"Best Documentary\" trophy from Central Oregon Film Festival director Shannon Winiger.\nA preview of the Queens of the Roleo documentary recently won Best Documentary in the Central Oregon Film Festival. We were honored to receive this award!\n         CURRENT PRODUCTION STATUS \nField and post production is completed. We hired an Emmy-award winning editor and a talented graphic designer. But there is a cost for their talent.

A labor of love. (Lots of labor!) As I have stated, it's almost as if the story chose me. And I gratefully accept the job. I'm working hard to keep costs down. So far I've covered all production costs. I've hired an editor and graphic designer. I've outlined above how donations will be spent. Raising the funds to help cover incurred costs and the cost for finishing the film is a challenge. That's where you, my Kickstarter partners (and brand new best friends), come in! \n\nOnce the documentary is completed there will be additional costs associated with distribution, film festivals, reward fulfillment, etc..\n\nIf there is a risk involved it is related to finishing the documentary in a timely manner.

She began playing World of Warcraft as way to cope, and her daughter Andie Bolt, a stand-up comedian, realized that there was a story to tell: many people in the online gaming community play as an outlet to deal with illness, trauma, stress and loss. WoW MoM the documentary was born!\nCentered around gamer/cancer patient Terry Bolt and her relationship with her daughter, Andie Bolt, WoW MoM shines a light on the positive effects of the online gaming community while at the same time raising awareness for NET/Carcinoids and helping erase the stigma around talking about cancer.   With the fantastical backdrop of World of Warcraft, and the communities that surround this and other games, our film dives into interviews with gamers and cancer patients alike, all of whom have used this unorthodox method of therapy to deal with hardship. Appearances include: Clare Grant, Chris Hardwick, Michele Morrow, Holly Conrad, Chloe Dykstra, Fortune Feimster, Greg Fitzsimmons, Adam Ray, AALG & Jarod Nandin.\nA Note From the Director, Andie Bolt\nTwo years ago on the Nerdist Podcast, Chris Hardwick asked what I talk about in my stand up. At that time my Mom was using World of Warcraft to cope with her cancer and I was telling jokes on stage as a way to deal. Chris Hardwick, to my delight and gratitude, came up with a brilliant plan: \u201cWe have to send your Mom to BlizzCon!\u201d My mom heard the Nerdist podcast and was bursting with excitement.\nAt the time, Mom was about to start a new clinical trial and this felt like a sign: I needed to stay with her and be part of this journey. After Mom got some rest, I told her the rest of the great news: \u201cWe\u2019re going to BlizzCon and I\u2019m going to film it! We are going to tell the world about your cancer so that maybe other people won\u2019t go undiagnosed like you.\u201d Her face lit up up as she realized by sharing her story of her battle with NET/Carcinoid Cancer, others may not have to suffer with a delayed diagnosis.\nAs I started telling this story, it was obvious that this project had much more to say than could fit into a web series. We needed a full-length film to tell these stories and accurately describe all the fantastic people I\u2019ve met on this journey. Making a project you really, truly care about causes people to come out of the woodwork; beautiful, kind humans who want to impact others in a positive way.  We weren\u2019t just playing Warcraft, we were making a documentary, but it felt like I had my own guild. Everyone had their roles and we were raiding through on the tiniest of budgets. This crew was giving everything and even at complete exhaustion, giving more. We shot 17 hours worth of footage at Blizzcon on two cameras alone with the entire crew crammed into one hotel room. Not one person complained. When I tried to pay my sound operator he said, \u201cDonate it to your Mom\u2019s hospital.\u201d Needless to say, I\u2019ve cried a lot making this. Lots of happy tears! No one has ever cared this much about something I was making. This isn\u2019t just my movie, it belongs to all of the beautiful people in front and behind the camera.\nDirector, Producer, Daughter\nAndie Bolt\nHere are the facts (per the Carcinoid Cancer Foundation):\nWoW MoM is lucky to have gotten the support of Nerdist Industries and Chris Hardwick, who believed in this film from the beginning. They got us this far: we've filmed over 150 hours of footage and knocked off a lot of Terry Bolt's bucket list!  But, we realized while making filming, that WoW MoM was a much bigger scale project than just a simple web series or short film.  \nWe need to make WoW MoM a narrative feature documentary, and the first step is getting to a rough cut of the film. Once we get to the rough cut, we feel confident that we can show WoW MoM to the production companies and distributors who have expressed interest in seeing it. \nThere are so many amazing, personal and poignant stories that interview subjects have shared, and our goal is to get WoW MoM seen by as many people as possible to entertain, raise awareness about NET/Carcinoids, and get people talking about gaming & cancer!\nThat's why we're coming to you: this film is about a community, for a community. We need your help to get it to the next level: A ROUGH CUT:\nEven if you can't donate, by simply sharing this Kickstarter you can help spread awareness for NET/Carcinoids and maybe prevent another misdiagnosis and another lost life. This isn't an MMO, you don't die and get back up, (unless you're a zombie. Which, if you're a zombie, good for you! Learning how to use the Internet!) We're going all out to get the word out about this movie and we need your help! If you can't help fund you can help market!  \n Here are 3 ways you could make this happen:\n1.

Friends, family, and even strangers have been so giving and kind, donating their production services, sharing their stories, and introducing us to countless interview subjects. But we can only get so far on favors and kindness. We\u2019re at the stage where we need to hire an editor. Editing is a very labor-intensive, mentally draining job, especially when you\u2019ve got 150 hours of footage, shot on many different formats. Our goal is to tell Terry\u2019s story in the strongest, most visually compelling way possible. We can\u2019t rush this. We want to do it justice. Wading through the footage is daunting, but with a professional editor who can make this his or her full time job for the next few months, this movie will turn out amazing!

You are amazing and actively helping projects get made and since other projects give continued updates you've come to expect those from us and I'm sorry for letting you down. I honestly thought that was gonna be the case. I thought we'd be able to do that, that I'd be able to do that. If this was just a narrative that wasn't so personal that wouldn't be an issue. This project, is my favorite thing I've ever done and the hardest thing I've ever done, as time goes I keep expecting it to be easier and that's not the case. So please believe me when I say nobody wants this project done and all the prizes sent out more than yours truly. I cannot wait to not wake up at 3am racked with stress about this project.

There's seeing everything you know through a new, different point of view.\nThese stories defy expectations and easy genre boundaries.\nBut if you want that sense of wonder and amazement when you first encountered speculative fiction, that idea that there is something different, something *more* just around the corner, just out of sight, that sense of coming home to the unfamiliar, then this is the book you want to read.\nThe Kickstarter exclusive edition will feature at least a frontispiece by Jenna Fowler, which will only be available through this Kickstarter.

Edited by Nayad Monroe, this anthology brings together stories from a diverse group of speculative fiction writers who provide insight into the possibilities. The book includes cover artwork by Steven C. Gilberts, and an introduction by Alasdair Stuart. Between the contributors, they have won the Bram Stoker Award, a Nebula Award, an AU Shadows Award, an Origins \"Cleo\" Award, a silver ENnie Award, the Authorlink! New Authors Award, a Octavia Butler Scholarship, and multiple other recognitions across the industry.\n\nKicking the Habit (and other works from Steven Saus): From the introduction: \"If you\u2019re looking for unyieldingly bleak stories, this collection might not suit your needs. As a member of Steven\u2019s writing group, I\u2019ve had the privilege of reading many of these pieces as they grew from nascent drafts through publication. In his stories, as in his life, Steven wants the weird, strange, even the horrifying, to be shot through with a thread of hope.

I'm creating a comic book--Justice/Vengeance--and I'm here today to ask for your help.\nI'm raising funds to support the creation and publication (both electronic and in print) of the first 5-issue story arc of Justice/Vengeance: Libations for the Dead. I've got the story. I've got the artists. What I need is the money to make it happen.\nSo what's this comic about? I'm so glad you asked.\nThe Premise!\nAdopted pre-law student Marcus Orestes never knew his parents\u2014not his biological ones, anyway. But when his birth mother dying of cancer contacts him, it will change everything. She whispers from her death bed that his father is the famous (and dead) superhero Justice, leader of the defunct band of heroes Supergroup.\nHis only chance to find out more about his past lies in a chance meeting with the alcoholic Lady Vengeance\u2014the infamous black sheep of Supergroup\u2014who has enemies of her own. And dogging their steps is the popular heroine Angel (or as her agent has decided, \"A-Girl,\" which tests better), who has sworn to bring Lady Vengeance to justice.\nGood thing Orestes has inherited some of his father\u2019s powers . . . though he has no idea how to use them.\nHe's in big trouble.\nThe Heroes!\nNote: If you had trouble hearing the video, I've posted a transcript here.\nThe Concept! \nThematically, Justice/Vengeance picks up the best of mainstream and Indie comics and plays with some of the grand and sometimes dark themes in the stuff I read and write.\nIt unpacks the tension between justice and revenge (a major theme in my work), explores the concept of superhero legacies, examines the role of superheroes in a society that both glamorizes and hates its celebrities, and just kicks a lot of villainous ass. From the outset, it embraces feminism and diversity, be it along ethnic, gender/sexuality, or religious lines.\n(Rated M for mature due to violence, sexuality (of all kinds), and swearing.)\nPrimary influences on the series include Powers (Bendis), Invincible (Kirkman), Ms/Captain Marvel (Reed, DeConnick), and Wonder Woman (particularly Rucka's and Simone's runs).\nThe Challenge! \nHow am I going to do this, you ask? Or, to put it more directly, is your money going to be put to good use? (Absolutely!)\nI made a deal with a couple awesome Bulgarian artists about a year ago to produce a sample comic (INJUSTICE, check it out here). You can find my penciler, Tangra, on Deviantart, and Robot Panda does colors. They\u2019re an excellent team and have really brought my vision to life. Together, we\u2019ve produced the first issue of Justice/Vengeance: Libations for the Dead, entirely funded by yours truly out of pocket. I have them in contract to produce the full first arc, which they are eager to do. These guys are workhorses and deserve every penny that I give them. The vast majority of the funds raised through Kickstarter will be going to them to produce my interior art.\nLettering, editing, and layout I am doing through my friend Charles \u201cZan\u201d Christensen, publisher at Northwest Press, a comics print devoted to LGBT comics. (Note: While J/V isn\u2019t necessarily focused on such themes, there is definitely some LGBTQ content. I'm a big proponent of diversity in my work.) Zan\u2019s really good at what he does, and with him and his connections I have all the mechanisms in place not only to put the book together in stellar fashion but also to print it. We\u2019ve crunched the numbers, and the amount I'm asking for is what we need to get this going.\n(Also: Check out Northwest Press\u2019s stuff. It\u2019s really fantastic.)\nI'm also in the process of recruiting a number of other artists to create additional prints, which will be on offer through the Kickstarter and might show up in published issues of the comic. I've been scouting out artists at Conventions and finding work on line that fits particularly well with my intended vision, and I know you'll be pleased with the results.\nThis Kickstarter is not about paying me to produce this work. It is solely about raising funds to cover the expenses and get this project underway. Excess monies will go to Stretch Goals, to my artists, to Zan for editorial services, and to cover costs for future issues.\nRewards!\nIt wouldn't be Kickstarter without rewards, now would it? And since booze is heavily featured in J/V, it's no surprise the rewards read like a cocktail menu:\nJustice, Single-Shot: The basic reward for backing the Kickstarter is a digital copy of the comic. For as little as $5, check out the first issue, which I hope to deliver more-or-less immediately (even before the Kickstarter is over). If you like what you read, come back for more! We've got a month.\nMake it a Double: The first two issues!\nKeep 'em Coming: A digital subscription to J/V issues 1-5, Libations for the Dead.\nThanks for the Memories: Secure your copy of the Trade Paperback collection of Justice/Vengeance: Libations for the Dead, collecting issues #1-5! (Estimated delivery Fall 2015.)\nSports Bar Rewards: I currently live in Seattle, but I'm from central California, so I've been a fan of both the Seahawks and their bitter rivals the SF 49ers. This is my shout-out to my fellow sports fans, and an opportunity to influence what happens in the book: I'm planning to feature a football game, and whichever of these rewards gathers more backers, that team will win the game. (Plus, you'll get an awesome comic book in the process.)\nPin-Ups: Comics are all about awesome characters looking awesome, and that's what these rewards are all about. You can see some of the Kickstarter exclusive J/V prints here, and more will be revealed throughout the campaign. If you select this reward, you'll get to pick which prints you want at the end.\nBut wait, there's more: Check out my other rewards for putting yourself in the comic, helping me design a character, and generally involving yourself directly in the early days of Justice/Vengeance!\nReward Add-Ons!\nNone of the rewards quite fit, or you want to add more goodies? Instructions for add-ons here. Also I will occasionally run Happy Hour power-up specials to speed us to a particular goal. (That page outlines the process.)\nRemember that while the Kickstarter is active, you can always come back and increase your pledge!\nStretch Goals!\nLet's focus on funding first, but rest assured, there are awesome goals on the horizon. These might be for additional monies or additional numbers of backers. For instance . . .\nAdditional Prints: Unlock prints by such amazing artists as Ian Llanas, Claudio Pozas, and more! (Note: Since I'll be double-checking the print(s) you want, you'll get a chance to select your reward from any unlocked print.\nHappy Hour (issue #6 of Justice/Vengeance): Our heroes take a break from their adventures, only to face a totally unexpected danger! (Note: Unlocking this issue will add it to the reward for everyone who got \"Keep 'em Coming.\")\nPublic Enemy (second story arc, issues #7-12 of Justice/Vengeance): Our heroes have attracted public attention to themselves--a dangerous proposition when you have an image to maintain, you're not ready for scrutiny, and/or you've convinced the world you're already dead. Don't feed the trolls!\nFallen Angel (third story arc, issues 13-18 of Justice/Vengeance): A-GIrl is trapped, alone and powerless . . . and even the younger generation of heroes has a rogue's gallery of its own.\nInferno (fourth story arc, issues 19-24 of Justice/Vengeance): To save her friend, Lady Vengeance must face demons both within and without, challenge an implacable foe, and confront her greatest fear: herself.\nThanks!\nThanks again for your support for my work and this project. It\u2019s the fulfillment of a lifelong dream, and a burning creative desire that just will NOT fade. Thank you for helping me see it realized!\nThanks for supporting indie comics. Thanks for being part of a movement that helps artists everywhere.\nThanks for backing Justice/Vengeance.\nI promise you won\u2019t regret it.\nCheers,\nErik", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhenever you're putting together a big project, it has a bunch of moving parts that all need to be greased and oiled. I've done my best to head off any potential mishaps, but if any come up, it'll be a fun adventure tackling them. \n\nMy interior artists are all set and ready to go, with an already agreed-upon rate that will be covered out of Kickstarter funds. Plus they're incredibly enthusiastic, so I project smooth sailing there.\n\nMy letterer and layout guru is a good friend and we have a good working relationship. No problems there.\n\nI have a good sense of printing costs, and my amount raised should more than cover it.\n\nMany of my rewards are electronic, so postage doesn't apply. For rewards that ARE physical, I've built in extra funds to cover mailing in order to do fulfillment, and added an additional fee for International shipping. Having recently shipped several of my books overseas, I know that can get expensive.\n\nDespite all my planning, it's remotely possible that we'll fund and I'll still find myself short on money, so let me make this solemn promise to you: I will fulfill all of my backers.

We plan on completing episode one by winter 2015, but have set the delivery date for winter 2016 in the case that we are able to deliver more than one episode. Any pledges over our goal will go towards making the experience richer and creating episodes two and three.\nUPDATES\nALL UPDATES\nPRESS\n  Press kit\nThis coming-of-age narrative follows Jenny LeClue, a young detective, living in the idyllic college town of Arthurton. Jenny takes on the case of her life when her mother is accused of murdering the beloved Dean Strausberry. She soon discovers that nothing is what it seems\u2026\nJenny is a brilliant young detective, sharp eyed, intuitive and a ruthless pursuer of the truth. But nothing exciting ever happens in Arthurton, and Jenny has grown bored of the gumshoe cases she usually solves. She longs for adventure and a real case to crack.\nJenny gets more than she bargains for when the Dean of Gumboldt University is found dead, and all the evidence points to her own mother. Jenny will have to use all her skills of deduction and reasoning to uncover the truth and clear her family name. In the process she will discover that Arthurton is not such a quiet town after all. Arthurton is filled with dark secrets, and there are people who will stop at nothing to keep Jenny from the truth.\nWho can she trust? How will she outwit the ever watchful Sheriff? Why has the lake started glowing at night? And why does everyone keep treating her like a kid?\nJenny LeClue is a coming of age tale. Sometimes funny, sometimes scary, always mysterious; it\u2019s a story about finding our strengths, accepting our weaknesses, and the blurred lines between what is right and wrong.\n We've been crafting Jenny LeClue over the last few years, and envision it as an episodic trilogy that rewards exploration and curiosity at every turn. This campaign hopes to fund the first episode.\nThis is a game about your choices and how they permanently affect the story. We want to deliver a rich narrative experience about relationships with delightful surprises and interactions. The story also deals with mature themes, complex characters, and an epic tangled mystery. We want you to help guide the direction of Jenny's journey, within the game itself.\nJenny LeClue is a handmade, 2D, exploration based, adventure game with a focus on story, character, and mystery. The game will initially support PC / Mac / Linux. We plan to add more platforms, especially iOS, after the desktop version is released. We are also looking into the possibility of Steam and Console support.\nEverything is interactive!\nExperience Arthurton, an expansive world with dark corners to explore, secrets to uncover, intriguing and suspicious characters, and mysterious cases to crack!\nTap, swipe, run, jump, and bike your way around Arthurton as you reveal secrets with your flashlight and unravel the mysteries of this deceptively dark town.\n Every moment is a chance to interact in new and refreshing ways. Dialogue scenes become a chance to explore and discover clues on a character\u2019s person and reveal whether they are a witness or a suspect. Curiosity is rewarded with captivating animations and goodies, making for a richer experience and a living world. It\u2019s not just pretty, it\u2019s alive!\nAs you solve mini-mysteries, and put the pieces of Dean Strausberry's murder together, you start to unravel a much bigger mystery\u2026\nExplore the abandoned mines, the forgotten graveyard, the misty mountains. Sneak into the police station evidence room. Wander the shops on Main Street and chat up the baristas at the coffee shop. Dig through the archives of Gumboldt University's Library.\n Jenny LeClue, a young detective, brilliant, spunky, irreverent, with a fierce sense of independence.\nArthur K Finkelstein, The Author, acts as narrator and will guide you if you lose your way. You also have the opportunity to help him and Jenny change the story, permanently, as it evolves. This doesn\u2019t just occur in your own playthrough, but will also affect the way future episodes are written and crafted for everyone. This is choosiness on a massive scale. You choose, together.\nHenry LeClue, Jenny\u2019s dad and the police medical examiner. He is a kind and caring man, but has separated from Jenny and her mom. He has not been seen or heard from in several months for reasons that are still a mystery.\nJulie LeClue, Jenny\u2019s mom and a former CSI who now teaches criminology at Gumboldt University. She\u2019s the only witness and number one suspect to Dean Strausberry\u2019s shocking murder.\nSheriff LeClue, Jenny\u2019s grandfather, is a stoic old-school kind of guy.\nDean Strausberry is the soon-to-retire head of Gumboldt University. He\u2019s a jolly gentlemen often seen shaking hands and kissing babies around town. \nCool Keith, your best friend, usually found around Mr Beans, the coffee shop on Main Street. He will patiently listen to your ridiculous theories about what's really going on in Arthurton. He also has a really cute dog!\nSuzie Glatz, your cousin, frenemy, and secret nerd genius. If you need a newfangled gadget beyond your wits and handy notebook, she's your best bet.\nMr Glatz, a prominent business man in town, and Jenny\u2019s uncle. He\u2019s definitely charismatic but something about him doesn\u2019t sit right with Jenny.\nJJ - Stock up on supplies and other thingamabobs in his overfilled junkyard. As JJ always tells Jenny \"One man's junk is another mans detective kit!\" If you want to upgrade your flashlight, he\u2019s got you covered. Bring him something weird and he might even give you a special reward.\nThese are just a few of the main characters, but there are even more curious citizens of Arthurton to interact with and investigate!\nDelve into a metanarrative and the story layers between The Author, Jenny, and you. Themes include family, loss, identity, redemption, and authorship. This is a story about a young girl, who is confident and in control of part of her life, but insecure in her personal relationships.\nThe story is influenced by my love for Mystery, Horror, and Sci-Fi. Some of my favorite inspirations ( in no particular order ): Twin Peaks, Professor Layton, Broken Age, Resident Evil, Veronica Mars, Ghost Trick, Limbo, Hot Fuzz, Encyclopedia Brown, Clue, Sherlock, Blue Velvet, Are You Afraid Of The Dark, The Silent Age, Kentucky Route Zero, CSI.\nSo why Kickstarter? Because I can\u2019t do it alone\u2026I need you! I need the help of a larger community in order to realize the dream of producing episode one of the Jenny LeClue Trilogy. Storytelling is my passion, and the wonderful Kickstarter community offers the possibility of creating a broader and deeper story than I have the resources to craft on my own.\nI have designed the environments and characters, outlined the story, and the game is ready to be brought to life.\nThis is the story I want to tell as an artist. This is the game I've always wanted to play as a gamer. This is the project I've been excited about making for years, and now we are ready to make that dream a reality. But we can\u2019t do it without your help!\nThese reward images are conceptual renderings.\nThe plan is to have episode one scripted and the game in alpha by Spring '15. This would allow us to time to create final art, animation, sound, music, polish the game, and possibly add voice acting for a launch in Winter '15. If there is enough support for episode two or three, these will follow after. \nThe game requires continued writing, storyboarding, design, game design, illustration, coding, modeling of sets, character rigging, character animation, sound design, music composition, and with the stretch goals, voice talent. All these things are needed to complete the game and this requires focus and time, critical luxuries as a freelancer. The initial goal will afford me these two opportunities. The higher stretch goals will open the doors to a fully realized version with all the bells and whistles and potentially the completion of all three episodes.\nPaying Skilled and Passionate Artists - This is a passion project for me, but other friends and professionals need to be compensated for their tremendous talents. Having a developer, illustrator, as well as an animator on Jenny LeClue would lighten the workload considerably and allow me to concentrate on the overall storytelling and design of the game.\nCompany and Operating Costs - Operating a business, Licensing, Equipment, Living Costs and Bills require a fair chunk of money and time.\nTesting, Refining, and Polishing - Beta testing, integrating Feedback from the Community, and using everything that I have to produce a game I've been dreaming of for years.\n These talented people have all contributed to the project in various ways.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nJenny LeClue is a big idea with a lot of moving pieces. A project of this scope is indeed a challenge, but I live for challenges. It's a big mountain to climb, but we have the tools, and with your support we can make it happen.\n\nMy 10 years of experience as a motion designer, director, and developer has allowed me to hone and polish my skills as a writer, programmer, animator, designer, illustrator and visual storyteller. Every project and every day presents a new problem-solving challenge.\n\nI also previously Kickstarted FATHOMS, a very long short film. I did everything on the project including writing, directing, modeling, animating, editing, sound design and compositing.\n\nI have also developed several iOS apps, including Anatomy In Motion, a top selling educational app and Facebook community with over 180,000 followers. I have also successfully designed and developed iOS apps, games, web, and mobile experiences using javascript for private clients and personal projects. Other team contributors have experience developing flash games, and iOS apps and games using Obj-C.\n\nWe are building the game using Unity, and have a few prototypes in production. I\u2019ve previously done all the development work myself, but the hope is with enough support we could bring on a dedicated Unity developer. This will allow me more time to focus specifically on the core game, art, and story experience.\n\nThe biggest benefits of using Unity are a trusted engine with a lot of 1st & 3rd-party support. More importantly, Unity is very flexible, and will make it much easier to support other platforms in the future including: iOS, Android, PS4, Vita.\n\nI'm super excited to go on this adventure together and climb that mountain!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #91", "update_userinfo": "PHYSICAL REWARDS & A BIG UPDATE COMING SOON!", "update_content": "Hello detectives!

Thank you for all your support and consideration ~\nGirls Make Games is a series of international summer camps, workshops and game jams designed to encourage girls to explore the world of video games. With the help of growing list of partners like Google Play, DoubleFine and the Computer History Museum, we're determined to address the gender gap in the games industry, one camp at a time.\nWHO WE ARE\nWe are LearnDistrict, an indie studio based in San Jose, CA. We are committed to providing students with access to knowledge through our games and programs like Girls Make Games.\nWHY YOUR SUPPORT MATTERS\nEmily's story is not unique. From being stereotyped to being ignored, it's hard work trying to combat the hostility that women - especially young women - face in video game communities these days. \nOne of the reasons we started Girls Make Games was to give burgeoning young developers in the face of these sometimes discouraging experiences the confidence and experience they'll need to pursue careers in video games. \nThe more support we can get for programs like Girls Make Games, the more confident young women will feel about becoming developers - knowing that others like them are getting the recognition, encouragement, and support they need.\n(For Dates and Registration, please visit www.girlsmakegames.com)\nUnited States: Los Angeles, CA; San Diego, CA; Boston, MA; Washington DC; Seattle, WA; Chicago, IL; Denver, CO; Austin, TX.\nEurope: London, UK; Warsaw, Poland; Copenhagen, Denmark; \nMiddle East: Dubai, U.A.E. \nAustralia: Melbourne and Sydney\nGIRLS MAKE GAMES NEXT YEAR and BEYOND\nWe're reaching over 5,000 girls this year, and want to teach 50,000 girls how to make games by the end of 2015!

Day of the Tentacle, Loom, Broken Sword, Gabriel Knight, Machinarium, The Cave, Gemini Rue... We have played hundreds of them, and that's why we wanted to use our first project to pay tribute to this wonderful genre.\nHowever, we also wanted to offer a visual presentation that is not often seen for this particular genre. Therefore, we decided to set our game in a fully 3D environment using a cartoonish art style.\nWhile designing A Rite From the Stars, we wanted to introduce some interesting and unique features in the gameplay to make the whole game experience fresh while also being true to its Point & Click nature.\nWe want to keep our vision intact, so we are developing this project using our own resources. However, development costs are still very high, which is why we need your support to make this adventure come true.\nAlso, please make sure you support us at Steam Greenlight because, if we ARE greenlit, you'll also get a Steam key with your game pledge!\nIf we reach our main funding goal, we will release the game for Wii U, Ouya, PC Windows, Mac and Linux.\nA Rite from the Stars is a 3D Point & Click adventure set in a paradisiacal yet dangerous environment: The Mystical Island of Kaikala. \nView of the Island of Kaikala\nKirm, a mute kid from the Makoa Tribe, must overcome a rite of passage in order to leave his childhood behind. In fact, he has been chosen by the stars to become a legend among his peers. So his rite will not be ordinary\u2026 and it will definitely not be easy. In order to complete his quest, he will have to master three paths\u2026\n...and a Final Trial.\nFeaturing\nPointing and clicking\nThree paths to complete in the order desired by the player\nA unique mechanic for every path\nPerformance-based achievements\nDifferent endings\nMore than two hours of original music\nNot featuring\nPixel hunts\nPointless walks\nBoring inventory management (also known as \"Use the stick in everything until it works\")\nAbout the paths...\nEvery path is different. The environment, the challenges and even the gameplay will feature an unique approach in each path. And you (the player) may choose how to complete them! For example, you can start with Wisdom, advance a little and then switch to Spirit... or Courage... or continue with Wisdom. You decide.\nWisdom is, of course, about the mind. Kirm will go through an ancient temple full of traps. In this path, Kirm will be able to pick up items and carry them within each temple room. However, there's no inventory, so he will only be able to carry one item at a time.\nCourage is about the will. Kirm will have to get deep into Kaikala's jungle in order to reach The Beast's Cave, where his destiny awaits. In this path, Kirm will meet his power animal, a meerkat. The player will be able to control the two characters at the same time. Teamwork is essential!\nSpirit is about the soul and its unknown ways. At some point, Kirm will gain the ability to enter into the spirit world, an alternative version of reality. He will have to use this power to reach the highest spot on the island: The Volcano's Crater. Once there, he will have to seek a revelation from the Heavens.\nKirm is our hero, a mute boy eager to become a man and a legend. He will have to demonstrate that he is braver, smarter and quicker than he seems. The trials that awaits him are not easy, but he will not be alone. Hoku, his guiding star, has descended upon Kaikala to light his paths.\nKirm and Hoku\nThe Makoa Tribe is led by three powerful masters. Each one will guide Kirm in a particular path. They are The Chieft, Ailani, Master of Wisdom; The Hunter, Kekoa, Master of Courage and Waha Nui, The Shaman, Master of Spirit. They will decide in the end, if Kirm is worthy of becoming, not only a member of the tribe, but a respected one.\nAilani (Wisdom), Kekoa (Courage) and Waha Nui (Spirit)\nThere are other characters in the game, but we do not want to say much about them at this point. However, here is some related artwork of one of them. His name is Pohaku.\nWho is Pohaku? What does he want? What's his favorite meal?\nWe do love music and we believe it is a main part of the game experience. One of our members, Daniel N\u00fa\u00f1ez, is a professional composer and audio designer. This means that the music of the game is being composed as the game grows. Our musician is present at all design meetings, absorbing the essence of every scenario, of every script line, of every bit of the game... The music of A Rite from the Stars is not just an addition. It is a core feature of the game.\nThe themes have Mesoamerican, Inca and Tribal African influences. Percussion and flute are the driving force. However, A rite from the Stars OST aims to fuse these elements with the contemporary orchestra. There are several influences, from Ennio Morricone and James Horner works to Civilization and The Legend of Zelda sagas OST's.\nYou can find some examples below. These songs are not final versions their are not mixed yet. Expect a higher sound quality in the final game. However, we are making a HUGE OST. We already have more than two hours of material.\nWe are also recording our own sounds to create a really unique experience. You know, we have a game designer who screams like a monkey.\nOf course, your support will not go unrewarded! We have prepared some great rewards to show our respect and appreciation for you, the people who like to help other people to fulfill their dreams. These rewards include an extra level designed only for backers' eyes, access to a backer exclusive in-game secret area, some skins, a digital release of the art book with concept art used for the game with commentary from the development team, a digital guide to the secrets of the A Rite From the Stars Universe and, of course, a DRM-free copy of the game and the original soundtrack. And there are more!\nYou can check all the reward tiers on the right. However, here is more information about some of the most exotic ones (in order of appearance).\nDRM-Free copies of the game and Steam keys\nDRM-Free copy of the game means that you get a PC, Mac, Linux and Ouya copy of the game. Steam key means that if we manage to get greenlit, you'll also get a Steam CD-Key. Okay, this not an exotic reward, but we just wanted to be clear.\nKirm's Secret Area\nA Rite of Passage is a hard endeavor. Sometimes it's good to have a place to rest, a safe haven to clear the mind and give rest to the body. Kirm is able to teleport back (thanks to Hoku) to the Makoa Sacred Grounds. However, the constant presence of the masters can stress anyone.\nFor that reason, every backer will have exclusive access to an in-game area where Kirm can rest for a while. An area which hides some secrets and some ancient artifacts. A place to watch the stars and where every backer will have a place (because every backer will have a star, look below).\nAn Extra level\nEvery Kickstarter copy of the game will feature an exclusive level just for you. We really appreciate your support, we really appreciate that you believe in us and for that we want to give you some unique content. This extra level and the Secret Area made for backers.\nKirm skins\nWe are designing some alternative in-game skins form Kirm, our hero kid. Every one of you will get one of them and the other two are reserved for the \"Sparkling Star\" tier. As we want them to be as awesome as possible, we want you to give suggestions. Feel free to tell us what kind of skin would you like. Maybe an Autumn Kirm? A Lightning Kirm? Maybe an Aztec Kirm? Keep in mind that we can't add designs whose copyright we don't own. Or course, they are also Kickstarter exclusive.\nHelp us to create a new version of Kirm!\nCollector Edition\nA physical package including the DRM-free game, the OST, game manual and a T-shirt!\nA concept version of the box\nGuide to the A Rite from the Stars Universe\nWho the Makoa really are? What are their traditions beyond rites of passage? What beings roam The Island of Kaikala? Why does the Goat like it so much? This book will disclose all of these mysteries. It will also include the testimony of the only occidental person who has claimed to travel to Kaikala and back. The infamous Spanish explorer Fabi\u00e1n P\u00ed\u00f1ez, sailor and treasure hunter from the XVII Century.\nAdvising Kirm\nYour words will travel to the Island of Kaika and will reach Kirm through his masters' voices. Ailani, Kekoa and Waha Nui will give many advices to kirm throughout the game. In fact, every time he is on the Makoa Sacred Grounds, he is able to approach them and hear their wise words. Some of those advices could be written by you! And every other player will be able to read them too.\nWaha Nui is waiting for you!\nCreating an item\nThe Makoa Sacred Grounds are full of ancient artifacts, mystical totems and wild plants. You will be able to create one of your own. Just use your imagination and our 3D artists will model it and we will include it in the game. You will also be able to write a description for it and Hoku will say it out loud when any player clicks on it. And maybe we would use it for some puzzle or cinematic!\nSome concepts\nDesigning a level\nBackers will be able to work with the team to create an entire level. You will give us your idea of a level (including a challenge for Kirm) and we'll make it real. We will also ask you for drawings made by you or reference imagines to fully understand your idea. Then, we will discuss it with you and work on it. In order to make it fit in the game, it is possible that we will need a lot of back and forth communications with The Goat's Crew. We will have to finally approve it, but as long as it fits with the game and it's not technically impossible, we'll do our best to share your vision of the Island of Kaikala with the world!\nThe Island of Kaikala is huge. There is room for more challenges.\nLimited Edition Physical 3D-Printed Figure of Kirm\nGo to bed while Kirm watches your room! Decorate your desktop! Make a huge diorama with figures from other videogames! The possibilities are infinite. Here is a concept sculpt (minor details subject to change).\nKirm in all his glory (minor details may change)\nMakoa Mask\nBecome the soul of every party with a handmade carefully crafted Makoa Mask! This is a very limited edition, meaning that only four will be created: one for Kirm and one for every master. You can choose three (I mean three backers, but if someone wants the three of them I think it's fine!). The fourth will remain in our office to remind us of these exciting times! Of course, the masks will be chosen in the order you pledge.\nStar System\nAnd on top of these rewards, you will also get to name a star in the game! Yes, you can give it your own name, or the name of a beloved member of your family. Seriously, whoever you want. It will also include a quote of your choice. This time around, the sky is the limit!\nEvery tier features a different kind of star. Take a look to the right for more information.\nWe\u2019ve also created two handy reward tables below so that you can see what it's included in each reward tier.\nRisin' Goat is just one of the many video game studios led by a goat. However, it is the only one that openly acknowledges it. Yes, we are led by The Goat, a mighty being who conspires to take over the world. We do not know how, but someway it is related to making videogames. So here we are to serve The Goat.\nThe Goat itself, our beloved leader\nOur website: www.risingoat.com\nBut \u201cwho are these people?\u201d, you may wonder. Well, as servants of The Goat we have two things in common: healthy mental madness and a passion for videogames. We knew that, one way or another, we would end up developing games. In September 2013, we knew that the moment had finally come. Indie studios were on the rise and technology was no longer a luxury, so we only needed a leader.\nThe Goat appeared to unite us under a single flag. In the beginning, we were just four people. However, as the project that would become A Rite from the Stars continued to grow, so did our team. We now work and dream together (but we still sleep in separate beds).\nThe Goat's Crew\nAlthough this is our first game, every one of us have previous experience on his respective fields. For more information, click on the picture above!\nDespite we are fully committed to this project, making a game is a hard endeavor. We are investing a lot of hours and our savings. The Goat is a supernatural entity, but the rest of us need to eat and pay bills. This means that some of us have to keep working on freelance jobs to keep ourselves alive. Therefore, this is where the funds would go:\nWith your help, we can speed things up and focus 100% on this project, and we can also make it even better. Sure, there are other alternatives like begging to a bank, finding an angel investor or reaching an agreement with a publisher, but we want to keep our vision and creativity completely unaltered. We think that Kickstarter is the perfect platform to fund our game.\nThis project is our baby and we want it to grow healthy and free of any constraint.\nOuya Doubles Our Fun(ds)!\nDouble Our Fun(ds)! We're participating in OUYA's #FreeTheGames Fund, created by OUYA to support developers making new and creative console games.

PSA\nPLAY\n\nVID Agents Promo #1\nPLAY\n\nLINKS:\nWebsite: www.vid-agents.com\nYoutube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/NewPhilms\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/thevidagents\nTwitter: @VidAgents\n'Vid Agents' is a feature length action-comedy web series. The succinct 110 page script will be divided into 16 episodes and each episode will be roughly 10 minutes in length.\nThe project is greatly influenced by many other great action-comedy films and television series, such as 'Beverly Hills Cop', 'Miami Vice', and 'Lethal Weapon\u2019\u2014just to name a few.\nWe love video games and think it is important that the show be fun and relevant to the modern gamer. So as an added bonus, we plan to sprinkle the episodes with friends from the video games world. FOR EXAMPLE: Jon St. John - AKA: \u2018Duke Nukem\u2019 was able to lend his voice for our trailer in our Kickstarter video!\nIn an alternate reality, video games have been federally outlawed by the United States government. The rationale for this law comes from the belief that the alluring power of video games (and more importantly, violent video games) drives people to commit violent acts. But now that they're illegal, the trade of games has become the most violent and profitable portion of the black market\u2014and that\u2019s where the 'VID Agents' come in.\nThe story follows Gabe Wolfe and Ethan Fox, two police officers who are promoted to become the inaugural agents for the brand new 'Video Game Investigations Division' in the Greater Los Angeles Area. Quickly Gabe and Ethan, as 'VID Agents', uncover that the game trafficking ring is bigger than they originally thought, and soon find themselves on the hunt for the biggest distributor in all of LA\u2014and the closer they get to finding this illusive criminal, the more dangerous it gets. \nWith an underground game trade ring threatening to tear Los Angeles apart, it's up to Gabe and Ethan to rid the city from these vile and deadly crimes as the 'VID Agents'!\nAny gamer knows that it is! \nIt\u2019s still a major topic every year for both politicians and the media. You can search on the internet for the debate about the link between violence and video games and never see the light of day, because there is no end to the articles and studies that have been written. And just to bring it all home, just last year in 2013 President Obama asked Congress to allocate $10,000,000 for a study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) looking at the relationship between video games, violence in the media, and gun violence.\nPhilip Bache is a writer/director/producer living in Los Angeles and the creator of 'VID Agents'. Some of his works include independent features, shorts, music videos, web shows, and video games. \nCurrently, he voice directs on AAA titles that have large Hollywood casts (sometimes over 100 actors) and expansive production schedules. Many of these games have gone on to win numerous awards, including 'Game of the Year'.\nWant to know he can produce and direct?\nHere's a link to the short film 'Cage Shift' that Philip and his talented team made for under $1,000, in less than 3 days, that got into numerous film festivals. It has recently been released online to help show the 'VID Agent' Kickstarters what we can accomplish.\nWant to know if he can write?\nYou can check out the fan 'spec' Ghostbusters 3 script he wrote, where he had top voice over actors read it live in a 360 seat theater on Sunset Blvd. The attending audience was able to listen to the script, while watching the story unfold on the screen with over 150 images. This one-night-only event gained some press around the world, especially among Ghostbusters' fans. That script is now available for free online.\nhttp://ghostbusters3event.com/\n\"I can\u2019t vouch for Bache, he might be the worst writer in California. But he certainly has a sense of occasion and opportunity...\" -Brendon Connelly, 'Bleeding Cool News' (article)\n\n\"Remember that awesome live read [of a Ghostbusters3 spec script] we talked about way back in June?...there\u2019s still no videos from the event, but on the flip side the script is now available to download and enjoy...I\u2019m about fifteen pages in and I\u2019m VERY impressed!\" -Jason Fitzsimmons, 'Ghostbustersnews' (article)\nCheck out more of the music featured in our Kickstarter video on BESTRACK's soundcloud page! He's an extremely talented musician on the rise. Without his 'soundtrack', 'VID Agents' would not be as fully realized. BESTRACK ROCKS!\nhttps://soundcloud.com/bestrack\nAs soon as we get the money to create this project, we are ready to complete pre-production and immediately head into production. \nMuch of the preproduction for 'VID Agents' has already been completed. Many of the actors have been cast, most of the locations have been scouted, and tons of props have been secured. The music has been licensed, and we have amazing talents assisting with the special effects required for the production. \nThe script was created with the mentality of being a project that can be produced on an indie budget before a single page was written. Having a true understanding of how to create great stories with very little is something that we excel at. Many people try to do this and fail, because they don't really know what things cost or how to get things done well on small budgets. \nWe do. \nMany friends and individuals who work in television, feature films, and even video games are ready to assist us with this show. It has always been the goal of 'New Philms' to bring you fun and great content no matter the medium. We're going to do just that with this project in our biggest endeavor to date. \nWe will put the money you donate directly into the show. Most of the funding will go towards feeding the crew and paying the actors a daily minimum. Since this is the first project that we are putting out to the crowdfunding public, we feel a need to prove ourselves to you at this level first, and that means working extra hard!\nWe want to release this as a web show that stands out amongst its competition. We always designed it to be a great indie feature, but web show distribution allows us to get 'Vid Agents' directly to the fans. \nOur hopes are to go directly into production as soon as our Kickstarter goal is met. \nWe will release 'Vid Agents' online for free for a limited time, but we may not have all the episodes available that way forever. As a 4th tier backer (and above) you\u2019ll be getting digital downloads and/or physical copies of the series, so that you will always have access to the complete show/episodes. To put it simply, your reward means something: you buy the show, you get the show. We might leave a few episodes up to keep it accessible and build an audience, but we also want the people who back our project to be part of something special.\nREWARDS ARE LAID OUT IN FURTHER DETAIL IN THE RIGHT SIDE OF THIS KICKSTARTER PAGE.\nThe more money we get from this Kickstarter campaign, the more flexibility we will have to make this project. By gaining extra funding, we hope to hire bigger names for the cast, buy essential equipment, and possibly even shoot this show on a better camera than we were planning to. However, better cameras means more storage space, bigger actors means more hoops to jump through, and bigger action means bigger stunts\u2026 And all of these things mean more money. We want 'VID Agents' to be the biggest and best it can be. Reaching stretch goals would allow us to create a better production and final product. \nHitting any of these stretch goals will benefit ALL OF YOU!\nWe put these other stretch goals on here in case this project goes crazy viral based on its concept.\nIf we reach: \n$200,000 - We will create our show in a way that is not as limited as we're originally planning this to be. This stretch goal would allow us to do what we originally set out to do and not limit the production. This means extra cameras (for coverage), more production hands (which we could really use), extra film equipment (like jibs and dollies), and a bigger overall production value that we can bring to the show.\n$400,000 - We will get Hollywood talent to come out and play bit parts in this series and secure a 'secret' talent that will come out to play the main villain!\n$600,000 - We have always hoped that we could reach out and get this show professionally translated into other languages so others could enjoy it around the world. If we reach this goal, we will make this happen. (Spanish, Italian, French, German, Korean, Japanese, and more)\n$1,000,000 - We will take this project, some of its crew and stars - on the road! We will plan on going to major cities / colleges around the United States and screen 'Vid Agents'. There, you will be able to meet us first hand. Hitting this amount will also allow us to begin preproduction on a possible second season of 'VID Agents' that we already have big plans for. And when we say big\u2026 we mean BIG!! FURTHERMORE - WE WILL ALSO MAKE AN 8-BIT VID AGENTS VIDEO GAME! Every backer will be allowed to get a downloadable version of this game. We already know some game designers who have said they would help make this happen.\nHELP SPREAD THE WORD!\nIf you'd like to see this project completed as much as we do, but can't donate (or have already), please share this with everyone you know! Spread the word via facebook / twitter / videogame forums / blogs / news outlets or any other place you can think of.

We have big plans not only for this production, but for many other great shows and features, but it starts here. If we reach our goal, you're letting us know that we're on the right track.\n\nWe waited for the right project to share with you guys and asked for a realistic amount of money to create a truly independent production.\n\nThis is a true passion project. No matter what the funding outcome is, we will work long, hard, and possibly for free to make sure we fulfill our vision for 'Vid Agents'.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Philip Bache\nFirst created \u00b7 17 backed\nPhilip Bache is a writer/director/producer living in Los Angeles.

You may know me as Kunta Kinte, from ROOTS, or Geordi La Forge, from Star Trek: The Next Generation. \nYou also may have grown up with me on Reading Rainbow. \nIt was my mother who taught me that, by picking up a book, I could \"go anywhere\" and \"be anything.\" Ever since Reading Rainbow began in 1983, I have dedicated myself to fostering a love of reading in children, just as my mother did for me. \nOver the past year, I have watched Kickstarter bring communities together to support artists and inventors. Again and again, I have been inspired by watching like-minded people team up to accomplish impossible dreams, and to change the world. \nNow, I am hoping you will join me on my mission: to bring Reading Rainbow back for every child, everywhere.\nTogether, we can change the lives of millions of children. But you don't have to take my word for it: just keep reading!\nI believe that every child has a right, and a need, to be literate. We have a responsibility to prepare our children\u2026 and right now, the numbers show that we, as a society, are failing in that responsibility.\nAnd here\u2019s the problem:\nAnd: numerous studies reveal that children who can't read at grade level by the 4th grade are 400% more likely to drop out of high school.\nAnd: as of 2011, America was the only free-market country where the current generation was less well educated than the one before.\nThese problems won't solve themselves.  Real change will require us all to work together. We cannot afford to lose generations of children to illiteracy. And if we work together, we don't have to.\nThrough Reading Rainbow, we've been working to solve these problems for over three decades. Starting in 1983, Reading Rainbow successfully used television to turn generations of kids into lifelong readers... with great results.\nOf course, when Reading Rainbow began in 1983, we were using television to bring books to kids, meeting them where they wanted to be. In 2014, TV is not that place anymore. Now, we\u2019re trying to reach a new generation of digital natives.\nThat\u2019s why, two years ago, I launched the Reading Rainbow App for tablets. Building on the basics of the television series, we put hundreds of quality books \u2013 and educational video field trips \u2013 right in a child\u2019s hands.\nThe response has been encouraging:\nBut despite this progress, there are big challenges left to face.\nFirst, not all families have access to tablets. Our goal is to cultivate a love of reading in all children, not just those that have tablets. To reach kids everywhere, we need to be everywhere: we need to be on the web, on mobile devices, on game consoles and on connected televisions. \nSecond, a resounding number of teachers have told me that they want Reading Rainbow in their classrooms, where they know it can make a difference. We will provide it, along with the tools that teachers need, including teacher guides, leveling, and dashboards. And with your help, we'll provide it to thousands of disadvantaged classrooms for FREE.\nEvery Home. Reading Rainbow\u2019s digital collection already contains hundreds of books and video field trips\u2026 but with your help, we\u2019ll be able to make the Reading Rainbow library available on more of the devices modern kids use to consume content. Now that we've met our initial goal of $1,000,000, we will be able to launch a new version of Reading Rainbow on the single most-used digital platform: the web. And now that we've reached our stretch goal of$5,000,000, we'll also be able to bring the service to mobile phones, Android, game consoles like XBOX and PlayStation, and set-top boxes like AppleTV and ROKU.\nEvery Classroom. Together, we want to provide Reading Rainbow to as many classrooms as possible FOR FREE! Now that we've reached our stretch goal of $5,000,000, we'll be able to provide year-long subscriptions in over 7,500 classrooms \u2013 and every additional $100K we raise lets us help 500 more!\nNo matter how much we raise, we promise that every dollar you pledge will bring Reading Rainbow to more platforms, and provide it for free in more classrooms.\nWe can make sure that millions of kids learn to love reading, but we can\u2019t do it without you. That's why I hope you\u2019ll join me in making a difference!\nI believe that spreading the love of reading is its own greatest reward. But if you're going to join our cause, we also have some wonderful prizes. But you don't have to take my word for it... Take a look!\nAside from the signed book, the rewards above will be available to anyone who pledges! \nBut we also have several LIMITED EDITION rewards... so be sure to get them before we run out! (And if we DO run out, keep checking back -- we'll do our best to add more when we can!)\nOr, if you prefer, you can also pledge for a reward package that will be gifted to the classroom or school of your choice!\nAnd, if you're just interested in Star Trek related rewards, and don't want all of the Reading Rainbow goodies above, we've also got a few special reward levels created just for you:\nThis Kickstarter \u2013 and Reading Rainbow \u2013 couldn't happen alone, so I want you to meet the full team behind our Kickstarter.\nEverytime I walk into the office, I am reminded that the Reading Rainbow team is made up of passionate, talented artists, producers, engineers, and so many more. Most of them grew up on the show, have families of their own now, and dedicate their working day to improving the lives of the next generation.  \nIt's an honor to be surrounded by my Reading Rainbow family every day, and we can't wait for you to join us.

Important coordination in pre-production (planning), production (shooting) and post-production (editing) are our biggest challenges. We have accomplished these principles in our past documentary film, \"The Video Craze\" and have learned to expect the unexpected. We are confident our past experiences will help us masterfully conquer the following:\n\n\nPRODUCTION- We have many different locations that we need to fly, hike, run, drive and swim to. Each person featured in our film is from a different town, city and perhaps country! We are prepared to travel with heavy professional grade equipment, work long hours until the job gets done right. The women are ready to tell their stories to us, and we want to make sure their interviews are full of meaning and entertainment. \n\nEDITING - As many great filmmakers have said over the years, \"The final rewrite is in the editing room.\" This could not be truer in our experience. Editing is always a challenge. We are facing this challenge head on by purchasing new computers and backing every edit we do on several external hard drives. \n\nMUSIC SCORE - As you can imagine, music is of huge importance in making a good film that people connect with. It is our goal to get a music score that matches the tone and emotion of our story. We already have a fantastic soundtrack included, but there is always that chance to get someone BIG! This could also include a future release of a soundtrack on iTunes!\n\nARCHIVAL FOOTAGE - For the historical piece of the film, our next challenge is to get approval to use archival clips from the 70's through the 90's. Not only will we now get to hear about the history of women pioneers, we will be able to see it. We have a team ready to go to get this done and licensed. \n\nVOICE OVER NARRATION - We plan for much of the story of the film to be told by the people, but for those sections where some explanation is needed, we need a great VO narrator. We have several known VO actors in mind but need the funds to pay them. \n\nMOTION GRAPHICS - The story we are trying to tell with our film is a BIG with a need for some extra visual *UMPH* to get a key point across. Motion graphics also include a quality intro & end credits sequence. It's our job to get our special effects graphic designer to give us the empowering vision this film needs. \n\nBUDGET - Our biggest challenge, and for many filmmakers like us, is staying within budget. If we go over our $60k goal, here is our breakdown of how we would utilize the extra funds directly into the film:\n\n$75k: Popular music: We need to make sure we cover cost for catchy music and bigger bands! \n\nAnimation: We want to create a fun and immersive visual film! \n\n$90k : Celebrity Voice Over! We have a few celebs in mind, and we could use a recognizable voice that people can connect with. \n\n$100k : International Cast! \nWe can go bigger and reach out to the other amazing women outside of the United States! \n\nOn a personal note, we believe in the power of self-funding with Kickstater. We have funding our own projects and have supported other films in the community. We hope that our message gets out to the passionate and loyal circle of gamers & film lovers. We are looking forward to telling our story.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #11", "update_userinfo": "Happy 2020 Here is the film!!!!", "update_content": "Official update: We realize this project has been postponed and delayed, but there has been a change of the guards and we have some exciting announcements...\nOur new Director Natalie Rossetti and Producer Imoto Harney have spent the last year and a half filming additional footage and adding our awesome new editor, Lear Bunda, who worked on tv shows such at Aqua Team Hunger Force and Squidbillies.\nIn addition to the fresh new crew, we have changed the name to \u201cGirls Game.\u201d Our new modern title is telling to the viewer what we are all about.\nWe have a finished film that we are extremely proud to release and are currently submitting to film festivals world wide for an official premiere.

Published by Sony, these games became legendary for their unique soundtracks, their snappy, frenetic action and the zen-like \"flow states\" that players entered into when they got into the groove. \nOriginal game screen and box cover art. The Amplitude logo is a trademark of Sony Computer Entertainment America LLC.\nBoth fans and reviewers REALLY liked the game. Some select quotes from back in the day:\nIn the 11 years since Amplitude\u2019s release, Harmonix has gone on to create true pop culture phenomena with the original Guitar Hero, Rock Band, and Dance Central. Still, there was a quiet clawing in the back of our minds. Pleas from Amplitude fans, strangers on the street, and veterans of the studio - we needed to revisit this era of gaming and update it for the modern age! \nWith the advancements in technology and the huge creative leaps forward our studio has taken, we believe we can rebuild Amplitude for current consoles and make it an even more amazing experience than before. We're aiming to deliver an updated soundtrack, incredible visuals, and fine-tuned controls. These improvements will be layered on top of the core mechanics and hallmark difficulty that made both FreQuency and Amplitude such amazing experiences when they first debuted. We\u2019re confident that we can make a game that will do its predecessors justice!\n\n  Early Crippler concept - Purple player launched a debilitating power-up on the green player.\nDuring Rock Band, we perfected our methodology for \u201cbeatmatching\u201d, which we intend to apply to this new title. We\u2019ll also be moving the game into the new proprietary engine Harmonix has developed over the past 10 years. In addition to better control over timing windows, this will also allow us to run at 60 frames per second and smoothly port the existing mechanics to PS3 and PS4.\nThe game, as designed for this Kickstarter, focuses on the core Amplitude experience. Single player and local multiplayer are included in the design, as are leaderboards for online bragging rights. The Beat Blaster (the ship), music notes, tracks and FX will all be modernized and gorgeous. The cyberworld around the tracks will be designed by artists and crafted by coders so that every pixel on screen can be driven by the underlying music. Even as we work through our plans for this Kickstarter, the game is beginning to take shape \u2013 an HD reinvisioning of the cult classic, smartly updated for today on every axis. We believe this is the game that fans of Amplitude have been asking for and a game that can only come from Harmonix.\nEarly Beat Blaster concepts\nMusic is at the heart of Amplitude. The all-new soundtrack will focus on songs with an electronic-based feel, with tones spanning dark and moody to bright and bouncing. \nOur award-winning audio team is uniquely capable of composing amazing music with ideal GAMEPLAY in mind. All the amazing patterns and runs that made Amplitude's gameplay so fun need sick music crafted to match perfectly. For this game, we plan to focus our efforts on music that is custom-created for the game. This has the best chance of creating KILLER gameplay feel and a well-balanced list of songs. And you can help us pick which tracks make it into the final shipping tracklist! Take a look at our backer rewards for more details on how you can make your voice heard, contribute tracks to the game, or get your hands on a limited edition vinyl soundtrack!\nLimited edition colored vinyl (mockup)\nAt its higher difficulty levels, Amplitude was hard as hell. We\u2019re talking \u201cDark Souls\u201d hard, but with music. We know that fans of the original will be expecting that same level of challenge in this new version, and we won\u2019t disappoint. The game will still feature its hallmark difficulty as you progress.\nIn the years since Amplitude, Harmonix developers have become masters at making rhythm games fun for everybody. While we\u2019re focused on designing this project to appeal to a \u201chardcore\u201d base, we intend for fans of more recent Harmonix products to feel right at home with this new game as well, if they\u2019re willing to put in the practice and hone their skills!\nOriginal Amplitude team members still rocking it at Harmonix\nMany of the original developers who made this game a classic are still here at Harmonix, and psyched to update the experience for all players.\nThese veteran developers will be joined by the best rhythm game devs in the industry, folks who\u2019ve shipped dozens of AAA titles. We\u2019re ready to deliver a one-of-a-kind experience that players can pick up and enjoy. This is a game only Harmonix can make, on time and on budget. But we know that we can't do it without your help.\nThe levels are dark and quiet on entry, but jump to life as players release the musical notes.\nOur aim with this Kickstarter is to be humble in our expectations. The current goal is to make a faithful Amplitude \"HD\" - the core experience from PS2\u00ae re-developed for modern gaming devices. We certainly have LOTS of crazy ideas that could blow this concept out. Your contribution, feedback, and community input will decide where this project will land and how many crazy ideas we can incorporate!\nEarly Beat Blaster sketches\nThis project is intended to be a love letter to old-school PS2\u00ae fans, but we need to know that this is something you actually want. This is the project WE desperately want to make, but we can\u2019t do it without your interest and support.

New platforms always come with some minor learning curves, BUT we have great producers and partners at Sony and we're confident we'll be able to overcome any obstacles\n\nTIMELINE AND TECHNOLOGY ROADMAP:\n\nThere are technical limitations to overcome in order to get the game running at 60 fps (a requirement to make all musical timing feel snappy). We have a strong plan about how to adapt our proprietary engine for these purposes, especially on PS4, but it is a risk.\n\n\nMUSIC LICENSING AND SOUNDTRACK COMPOSITION\n\nWe want to have the right balance between great electronic songs you know and the type of amazing original compositional work we did in the original PS2\u00ae games.

We plan to address challenges along with opportunities using three key principles: transparency, priority, and agility.\n\n- Transparency means you'll hear about the tough choices.

What we've promised, we'll deliver, and we'll always keep that top of mind, in every discussion.\n\n- Agility means we'll find a way. We have no great boulders of policy that have to move when we need to make a call. We won't stall out on the decisions that need to be made. We're going to pick the direction we feel is right for you, right for the product and right for us, and go.\n\nIt's not always going to be smooth sailing.

We had an idea about how to make a game more fun, and it worked! \n\nOver the years I have changed, tweaked, and perfected it. I have shown it to the top industry professionals, and used their feedback to make it better, and I have played it with the spunkiest little kids, (including my own amazing autistic son), and used their feedback to make it more fun. \nThis game is going to be AMAZING! It will be a unifying game that parents can play with their kids, and that kids can play with their differently abled friends.\n\nIf you like classic family games like Speed, Spit, Spoons, Set, or Double Solitaire, you'll love FLIP FLASH!\n\nTo play Flip Flash, players simultaneously flip through their cards, and race to play them on shared number piles in the center of the table. First card to the pile gets to stay! \n\nYou can play a number higher or a number lower than the top number on a pile at any time, only the color has to match. Of course if you play a WILD card, you can change everything about the pile to suit you, simply yell out the color and number you want the wild to represent.\n\nWhen you have played all the cards in your down pile, you can yell \"Flip Flash\" to end the round. Scoring is +1 for every card played, and -2 for every card remaining in your down pile.\n\nPlay as many or as few rounds as you like! Each round is only about 5 minutes long!\n\"Kids loved it, but there were a lot of adults that stayed for several rounds...myself included.\" -Robert Wolf, Game Store Owner\n\"Great game, our kids loved it!\" -Seth Hiatt, Mayday Games\nIf you want to give Flip Flash a try, just go to our Facebook page here to get a free printable version of the demo game!\nArt NOT final. Placeholder art provided by Stan!\n The FLIP FLASH basic game makes a fast and enjoyable party game for 4, as well as a quick game of solitaire when you're on your own!\nAn average game lasts about 20 minutes.\nTo make the game longer play five or six rounds, to make it shorter, just play one or two rounds!\nPeople aged 5 years and up enjoy playing FLIP FLASH, and all ages can enjoy playing it together!\n\nTHE FLIP FLASH TEAM:\n\nFlip Flash was created by Naomi Tripi, game designer, production company owner, promoter, and lifelong game enthusiast.\n\nThe Art for the game Flip flash will be created by Stan!\nStan! is the award-winning author of 2 novels, 15 short stories, more than 60 gaming products, and innumerable cartoons and comics. He is currently the Senior Producer for Super Genius Entertainment. In times past, he has been an Associate Art Director for West End Games, an Editor and Game Designer for TSR, Inc., a Senior Designer and Producer for Wizards of the Coast, and a Creative Content Manager for Upper Deck Entertainment. Stan! is a founding member of both The Game Mechanics, Inc. and Super Genius Games. He also has done freelance writing and design for companies ranging from Green Ronin and Malhavoc Press to Viz Media and Harper Collins Children\u2019s Books.\nGraphic design and layout is being done by Cori Jones:\nCori Jones has been rocking the world of Graphic design for over 15 years, and his clean, artistic design sensibilities bring a unique clarity to the card and box designs.\nClick here to see my how-to video!\nEach player gets their own deck, and builds a down pile. Then they deal out four cards face-up next to it. As soon as everyone is ready, someone shouts \"GO!\" and all the players simultaneously begin starting number piles in the center of the table, and playing on each others number piles. \nThe number piles are not removed from the table for the duration of the round, and continue to grow and change very rapidly throughout the game. Players can play a card higher, or lower than whatever number is showing on the top of any given pile, but they do need to be sure to match the color of the pile. \nAlso, players can place a wild card on any pile and announce a number, and a color, and then play a card higher or lower than the number they called, in the new color on that pile. The speed and excitement build until someone who has played all of their down pile cards shouts \"Flip Flash!\" and everyone must stop. \nNext, the players gather and sort all of the cards that have been played in the center of the table. The cards that have been played are worth a +1 each, and the cards from the down pile that were not played are each worth -2 points. The player with the most positive points wins the round. Play one or two rounds for a quick game, or play six or seven rounds for a longer game.\nWhat makes FLIP FLASH different? \nThe ability to play up or down on the number piles, and the wild card twist, speed up the game by making sure that you rarely stay stuck for long! The number piles are never capped off, or removed from play during a round, so as each round goes on the action builds a thrilling frenetic energy!  \nIf you like classic games like Speed, Spit, Spoons, Set or Double Solitaire, you'll love FLIP FLASH!\nWhat does the crowd say?\n \"Flip Flash is more engaging, and rewarding, than staging a gummy bear war to eat the injured!\" -David Stair, Programmer\n\"Kids loved it, but there were a lot of adults that stayed for several rounds...myself included.\" -Robert Wolf, Game Store Owner\n\"It's fast-paced, and will appeal to most people. All ages can play it.\" -Kristy Jones, Gamer, mother\n\"I used to play a game back in middle school which was called Spit. It played like Double Solitaire with a dexterity element added to it. It was one of my favorite games growing up. This is like multiplayer spit to me. I loved it. It's pure chaos but incredibly fun.\" -Luis Diaz, Gamer\n\"Great game, our kids loved it!\" -Seth Hiatt, Game producer, distributor\nWhat does the game look like?\nEach basic game box includes:\n1 Plastic insert to help keep your cards in place.\n4 Decks of 60 cards each.\n1 Rules sheet. \n1 Scoring pad.\nEach set of EXCLUSIVE KICKSTARTER ONLY EXPANSION PACKS includes 48 cards that add a fun dimension to the game. \n12 Color-only wild cards (3 for each deck)\n12 Double-up cards (3 for each deck)\n24 \"Pause\" and \"Un-pause\" cards (6 for each deck)\nThe design of these cards design will only be offered as an exclusive reward to FLIP FLASH Kickstarter backers.\n The art is NOT final, placeholder art is being provided by Stan!\nThere are three suits, red, yellow, and blue. Each have a textured background to assist those who are color-blind to play the game with ease.\nSo, with our basic funding goal, we will be able to produce the game, fulfill the commitments to our backers with quality packaging, shipping, and safety testing. We will be able to promote, warehouse, and finance fulfillment of future orders, and pay all business related taxes and fees.\n\nBut what about our STRETCH GOALS!?!?\nI'm glad you asked\u2026\nEvery enhancement unlocked by our stretch goals will be added to every backer reward level $10 and above.\nSocial Media Stretch Goal#1:\n300 Facebook Likes!\nWhen we reach 100 Facebook \"Likes\" for Flip Flash,  Naomi will post a video demonstrating some of her favorite Flip Flash moves, and we will hold a contest on Facebook for extra rewards.\nSocial Media Stretch Goal #2:\n500 Facebook Likes!\nWhen we reach 500 Facebook \"Likes\" for Flip Flash, the strategy guide will be added to every reward level, and posted as a printable PDF on our Flip Flash Facebook wall. \nSocial Media Stretch Goal #3:\n**1000 Facebook Likes for Flip Flash**\nHidden\nSocial Media Stretch Goal #4:\n**2,000 Facebook Likes for Flip Flash** \nHidden\nFunding STRETCH GOALS!\n$8,000\nOnce we reach our funding goal, the first run of our basic game and expansion packs will be made.

As we reach our stretch goals things might shift around a little, but this will remain as the budgeting framework of this project.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith any production project there are many known and unknown dangers lurking in the shadows, ready to jump out and surprise everyone. However, going into a project with your eyes wide open, and addressing as many issues as you can anticipate beforehand helps a lot. \n\nI have priced out several sizes of production runs, calculated storage, shipment, and fulfillment costs. I've diversified my estimates from production houses both domestic and foreign, as well as researching import tax, product testing, and many other small variables that I know can come as an unwanted hurdle late in the game for many indy game producers. \n\nMore specific to the Kickstarter genre of troubles that await is the ever looming threat of becoming overwhelmed with too many backers, unforeseen shipping costs, losses from damaged goods, and potentially having some pledges bounce. I have calculated all of these into my financial crumple-zone, and I know my limits, both with time, and money and in order to keep good faith with my backers, and I committed to keeping this project within my capability to fulfill the rewards and all other commitments.\n\nFinally, I want to thank everyone who has taken the time to look over my kickstarter. Please back my project, and help me make this awesome game!

For hundreds of years, the Horrors ravaged the world, a time of suffering and destruction called the Scourge. People survived, hidden away in magical underground shelters called kaers. Generations lived\u2014and died\u2014locked away from the stars and sky behind their wards.\nThe Scourge ended a hundred years ago. The survivors, blinking in the light of the sun, opened their kaers and began to rebuild. Much has been lost and forgotten, and dangers await the unwary. There are those that conspire to seize power and dominate their fellows, and some Horrors still lurk in the darker corners of the land.\nHeroes have emerged in this new world. Some fight to protect those rebuilding their lives. Others uncover mysteries and treasures lost to the past. And some bring the light of hope to those still hiding from the darkness of the Scourge.\nIn Earthdawn, you take on the role of these heroes. Play a Swordmaster, whose tongue cuts as deep as his blade. Master the powers of earth, water, and fire as an Elementalist. Use the magic of story and song as a Troubadour, entertaining and inspiring.\nBeastmaster. Nethermancer. Weaponsmith. What will the legends say about you?\nThe Ruins of Parlainth, the Lost City\nWhat makes Earthdawn special?\nAsk fans of Earthdawn this question, and you\u2019re apt to get a dozen different answers.\nThey might talk about the rich setting, one that gives a lot of the common tropes of fantasy adventure gaming a reason to exist. It mixes the familiar with the exotic; dwarves, elves, and humans mingle with the lizard-like t\u2019skrang, the earth-skinned obsidimen, and the small, flighty windlings. Merchant airships ply the skies, watching for attacks by troll raiders. Nomadic bands of orks ride with their herds and field fierce cavalry.\nSome might go into how the open-ended dice system allows a chance at heroic results, or how the numbers on your character sheet are more than an abstraction, but also something concrete in the game world.\nStill others might explain the importance of legend\u2014not only in how it plays into the past, but how it affects the future. Your character is inspired by the heroes and legends of the past, and is creating their own legacy and legend for those heroes yet to come.\nPerhaps they would mention the rich magic system; how patterns and threads bind everything together. That magic sword you found can only have its true potential unlocked by learning its history\u2014who wielded it, and what deeds did they perform? Once you know these answers, you bind yourself to the item, adding another chapter to its tale.\nThey might talk about the lands and peoples of the world. The Lost City of Parlainth, whose magicians sealed themselves away\u2014with the very monsters they were trying to hide from. Garlthink One-Eye, the legendary Thief who some say sneaks into Death\u2019s domain every night and steals another day of life. The Wastes, once a rich and fertile land; now the source of a continuous rain of ash. The Great Dragon Icewing, who will allow visitors to ask him questions\u2014provided they bring a sufficiently valuable gift.\nAll of these things\u2014and more\u2014make Earthdawn a game that has been earning fans for over twenty years.\nCrystal raiders drop on an unsuspecting caravan\nA New Edition?\nThe original edition of the Earthdawn game stopped being produced in 1999. In the following years fan-founded efforts licensed the property and released their own material for the line: Living Room Games released Second Edition, and RedBrick Limited released the Classic and Third Edition of the game.\nNow, twenty years after its initial release, a new edition is in development under the FASA Games banner. In addition to revising and polishing the game rules, this new edition of Earthdawn will update the setting, putting in place a new status quo for players to explore. The goal is to make the game more accessible and friendly to players unfamiliar with Earthdawn and its history.\nWe're revising the game mechanics, keeping the Step System but streamlining how successes work, among other changes. We're opening up the Disciplines a little more, but keeping some constraints a to how they advance, which ties in with how legend and belief power the Disciplines in the game world. We're going through the spell lists and bringing them up to date with the revised mechanics, and adding new spells. There's a lot of changes - too many to present here without flooding the Kickstarter page.\nFollow these links to the Line Developer's blog posts about the new edition.\nPreview #1: Basic changes to Talents and Success Levels\nPreview #2: Discipline redesign, using the Beastmaster as an example\nPreview #3: Discipline redesign theory, Karma Ritual, and Durability changes\nPreview #4: Metaplot Advancement\nPreview #5: Spells changes, with an example new spell\nPreview #6: Design Goals\nPreview #7: Revised Talents list and descriptions\nThe Gates of Throal, seen from Bartertown\nWhat am I funding?\nThe Player\u2019s Guide and the Gamemaster\u2019s Guide include all the rules needed to explore the Age of Legend. Thanks to a stretch goal being achieved, these volumes will include color plates, like the First Edition rulebook back in the day. This campaign is intended to fund production and print costs for those two books, which includes new artwork, substantial revisions, and new material for the game world.\nIn addition, we have unlocked the following through our stretch goals:\nGM Screen - Free to everyone who orders a physical book (softcover or hardcover), this is a standard trifold cardstock screen, with tables on one side for the GM and artwork on the other for the players.\nTravar: City of Merchants - sourcebook covering a location previously only briefly mentioned, now a fully developed setting\nED 4E Companion - a third core rulebook containing all the higher Circle information: Discipline structures, Talents, creatures, and challenges appropriate to higher Circle characters\nElven Nations - sourcebook covering the Blood Wood, Shosara, Sereatha, and the former Western Kingdoms, now known as the Wastes\nQuestors - sourcebook detailing those who dedicate their lives to one of the Passions, the divine archetypes of basic drives who form the pantheon of Barsaive. Includes substantial new material about the Passions and their Questors, their path, their powers, and their impact on society.\nPledge Levels\nHere's a summary of the Pledge Levels and what you get at each.\n$1 - Our most heartfelt thanks!\n$10 - PDF Copy of Travar: City of Merchants, Questors, or Elven Nations\n$15 - PDF copy of the Earthdawn 4th Edition Player's Guide, Gamemaster's Guide, or Companion\n$20 - Softcover of Travar: City of Merchants, Questors, or Elven Nations, plus PDF copy.

There may be additional goodies.\nPlease look to www.fasagames.com for more details on the print products. Once again, thank you for your support.\nAlternative Payment Options\nIf you can't or don't want to use a credit card, you can pledge through our online shop. The products listed in the linked shop section mirror the rewards currently available with this Kickstarter campaign. They are provided for people who do not have credit cards and/or wish to participate via Paypal. A few things to remember: Your account will be charged as soon as you place your order. Shipping costs will likely be higher than for Kickstarter pledges because of the way our on-line shop works. All pledges made via our online shop will count towards meeting stretch goals.\nAdd-Ons\nLooking to customize your pledge rewards a little bit more? Want extra copies of some of the rewards? Here is a list of add-ons currently available. To add these on, adjust your pledge amount to include the price listed below, and add in your note what add-ons you are including. This will be confirmed in the survey at the end of the campaign. You don't have to add shipping unless you're outside the USA, and then only if the add-on puts you over the item count. See below for the international shipping charges.\nTravar: City of Merchants, Questors, or Elven Nations PDF -- $10\nPlayer's Guide, GM's Guide, ED4E Companion PDF -- $15\nSoftcover and PDF copy of Travar: City of Merchants, Questors, or Elven Nations -- $20\nCover art poster -- $25\nAdditional copy of softcover Player's or GM's Guide or ED4 Companion -- $30\nPolo shirt -- $30\nAdditional copy of hardcover Player's or GM's Guide or ED4 Companion -- $50\nPrices include domestic U.S. shipping. For international shipping, add:\nOne item -- $20\nTwo to Four items -- $30\nFive or more items -- $60\nOur apologies if this shifts during the KS. We're at the mercy of the international shipping industry. Prices fluctuate whenever a postal service somewhere in the world raises their rates. If the price of international shipping rises after you make your pledge, we'll eat the difference. This shipping cost covers all items shipped as part of your pledge reward. For example, if your normal pledge reward included two books, and you add-on two more items, you would not need to increase your shipping cost, as you only have four total items.\nWe will hold your order until all the items are available, and only ship one package, unless you tell us otherwise. If you want to split the shipping, and receive your items as they become available, please contact us at contact@fasagames.com so that we can work out the necessary additional shipping based on where you live. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll projects carry risk, whether building a tall building, making a movie, or any other complicated endeavor. Projects can run out of time and/or money, people may leave, assumptions made at the beginning may turn out to be incorrect or the results may simply not be as good as expected. Game development is no different in this regard.\n\nWhile much has already been done to validate our assumptions wherever possible, there is always the possibility of something unexpected cropping up. Games take time to create and we don't always know which challenges are going to the most time consuming. Our project managers have taken this into consideration, but there is always the risk it may not be enough.\n\nEarthdawn is a richly developed gaming world. We are only enhancing what already exists. The changes to the core rules are complete at this time. Barring the unexpected we feel confident we can deliver the Player's Guide and Gamemaster's Guide as scheduled.\n\nWe believe our target funding goal is sufficient to complete our vision for the products. If you're as excited about this game as we are and help us exceed that goal, we have much more we wish to do for Earthdawn. This is just the first step in an exciting journey!

Onboard the spacecraft is a 12-inch gold-plated copper disk, carrying the music of Bach and Mozart, and Blind Willie Johnson\u2019s recording Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground. Meanwhile back on earth, Blind Willie Johnson's significant contribution to the world of music is far too often overlooked. Our mission is to shine a light and acknowledge this important and influential artist currently representing mankind in outer space.\nThe creator of the award-winning album and independently produced Gotta Serve Somebody: The Gospel Songs of Bob Dylan hopes to return in 2014 with God Don\u2019t Never Change:The Songs of Blind Willie Johnson. God Don't Never Change is a production of Jeffrey Gaskill and Burning Rose Productions that invites backers of the project to share in the album making process and a celebration of Blind Willie Johnson.  His previous effort which The New York Times called \"The best African-American covers of Dylan songs since Jimi Hendrix\" earned Grammy nods in the categories of Best Traditional Soul Gospel Album and  Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals for Gonna Change My Way of Thinking by Bob Dylan and Mavis Staples.\nWith a proven track record of success and a mind blowing list of artistic talent, the project's creator is ideally suited to create some great new music and launch the first-ever all-star tribute to Blind Willie Johnson.  But in order to make \u201cGod Don\u2019t Never Change\u201d a reality your help is needed!\nBlind Willie Johnson\u2019s records continue to capture listeners in a way that few singers or musicians have equaled.  The list of artists he has influenced goes back to Robert Johnson and forward to the White Stripes.\nWhen you think about tradition you can't fail to notice the Blind Boys of Alabama (Motherless Children) a group that started in 1939 in Johnson\u2019s lifetime and still continues today. Cowboy Junkies (Jesus Coming Soon) radiate that haunting ethereal feel of the early blues.  You can hear Johnson\u2019s influence and themes in Luther Dickinson\u2019s (Bye and Bye I'm Going to See the King) work both as a solo artist and with the North Mississippi Allstars. Lucinda Williams (Nobody's Fault But Mine) comes from that part of the country, where Louisiana meets Texas, just a stones throw from Beaumont where Willie spent his last years.  A new recording of Johnson material by Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi (Keep Your Lamp Trimmed and Burning) is certain to bring out the best in his sweet slide and her bluesy voice.  No one can sing with the raw emotional depth of Rickie Lee Jones (Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground) and she will reveal the words to this acclaimed song. Sinead O\u2019Connor (Lord I Just Can't Keep from Crying Sometimes) recently opened her gospel session concerts at Lincoln Center with two of Johnson's songs and is sure to conjure more magic here. Tom Waits (Soul of a Man AND John The Revelator) has agreed to not one but two recordings for the album and one can easily compare the rough gravely voice of Mr. Waits to that of Willie Johnson. Who will join us next?\n  FIVE Handmade Cigar Box Guitars Made of Wood From Blind Willie Johnson's 1930's Home\nThe boxes are beautifully handmade, fingerjointed and bookmatched Southern yellow pine accented by dark grain, nail marks, rust stains and other natural imperfections.\nThe dilapidated Marlin, TX Hunter Street home of Blind Willie Johnson and Willie B. Harris. The Blind Pilgrim Collection was made from three boards rescued from this structure.\nMARLIN, TX -- Sadly, the remnants of the 1920\u2019s/30\u2019s Marlin, TX home Johnson made with his wife and singing partner Willie B. Harris were recently demolished.  It was here that blues researcher Dan Williams discovered and visited Harris in the 70's and where journalist Michael Corcoran interviewed Johnson's only known Daughter Sam Faye Kelly shortly before her death in 2005.  We were able to obtain three boards that had fallen free from the dilapidated structure and deliver the wood to the capable hands of George Brin at String Tinkers in Putnam, CT.  He carefully cleaned up this old Southern Yellow Pine and painstakingly hand made ten magnificent fingerjointed boxes bookmatched front and back to create these rare and highly collectible cigar box guitars now called \u201cThe Blind Pilgrim Collection.\u201d  Only ten of these instruments were created.  Each unique 4-string or 6-string guitar is numbered with a brass plate on the back, comes with solid supporting documentation of the wood and home, instructional DVD \u201cThe Guitar of Blind Willie Johnson\u201d by Tom Feldmann, Tom\u2019s signature series slide, and a black padded nylon carry case.\nCredits:\nGuitars by String Tinkers.\nPerformed by Tom Feldmann at Underwood Recording Studio. \nFilmed by John Christenson.\n                                                                                        L to R: Limited box set, Columbia Label t-shirt with artist names, Art Print, Double 180-gram gatefold LP, and CD.\n\nALL BACKERS WILL RECEIVE EXCLUSIVE UPDATES!\nAs the project unfolds You will receive regular backer exclusive updates throughout the fundraising and album making process.

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe greatest risk is the project will only be made if it's funded by YOU. We don't foresee any issues, but multi-artist compilations invite scheduling problems or perhaps waiting for the best artist to cover a particular song.

BUT...\nIf you missed the Kickstarter campaign, you can still help get to the next stretch goal (and get Obduction and more) at obductiongame.com! \n Ob`duc\u00b4tion, n.1. The act of drawing or laying over, as a covering. \nObduction is an all-new, real-time, first-person adventure that harkens back to the spirit of Cyan\u2019s earlier games Myst and Riven. Obduction resurrects that incredible feeling of suddenly finding yourself in the middle of a new world to explore, discover, solve, and become part of.\nThis year marks the 20th anniversary of the launch of Myst, one of the best-selling computer games in history. Myst was an exploration through a landscape of dramatically realistic images (rendered in Strata - check out the new Strata reward tier!) tied together to create an experience that was described as \u201cbecoming your world.\u201d The Myst name is widely recognized as uniquely defining a new kind of gaming - amazingly immersive worlds where the point is to understand your environment rather than test your reflexes. The Obduction project will take what Cyan knows about creating deeply immersive worlds and apply it to an entirely new game with fantastic scenery, incredible architecture, compelling story, and exceptional challenges.\nObduction will be built with the same framework that made Cyan's earlier games such a wonderful experience: stunning landscapes, deep storyline, engaging characters, dramatic soundscapes, and challenging yet intuitive puzzles. Obduction is an entirely new property, delivered using one of the most powerful game development technologies available today. Obduction is an adventure game for the new millennium that stays true to the concepts that made the genre great.\nAt the base funding level, Obduction will be developed for both Windows and MacOS, with a targeted release of mid-to-late 2015.\nThe game is being designed with a flexible scope in mind, so that as the budget grows, the game grows. More places; more puzzles; more mystery; more complexity; more adventure!\nWith the generalities out of the way, it's time to dig a bit deeper into specifics. If you know anything about Cyan's worlds, you know that you don't want to know too much ahead of time. We'll try our best to whet your appetite, without giving away too many spoilers.\nStory\nObduction's experience supplies what every good storyteller does: a very personal window into a much larger world. Obduction begins with... well\u2026 an abduction - your abduction. On a crystal clear, moon-lit night, a curious, organic artifact drops from the sky and inexplicably whisks you away across the universes to who-knows-where (or when, or why).\nAnd, as anyone who ever played Myst or Riven knows, exploring everything around you allows you to read between the lines and to begin to answer your questions. Why is there an old, abandoned farmhouse - complete with white picket fence - in the middle of an alien landscape? You'll find out. From this point on the story becomes your story. \nGame Design\nObduction has a few game design elements in common with Myst and Riven, and it skews into new areas as well. Cyan's basic design philosophy is simple:\nBuild every element of the experience to make you, the player, feel like this virtual world has become your world.\nThe interface should be intuitive and transparent.\nThe story should be revealed through exploration and not necessarily shoveled out in cinematic form.\nThe puzzles should range from easy to difficult, but even the toughest puzzles should be designed so that you know that all the pieces to solve it are there in front of you.\nThe sound and music should be balanced; they should add emotion but not become distracting or annoying.\nEnvironmental Immersion\nCyan has a proven history of delivering visually stunning environments that immerse players in our games. We plan to continue that tradition, leveraging Epic Games' Unreal Engine 4. Today's modern realtime engines have plenty of horse-power to produce zillions of bullets per second, but they can also be used to make remarkable landscapes and architecture that approach and even surpass the pre-rendered days of Riven. Unreal 4 is an amazing resource that enables us to build a world that you can lose yourself in.\nClick here for more info regarding the Unreal Engine 4...\nWe\u2019ve got add-ons. Three to be precise - add on a digital game, a boxed game, or a t-shirt. Here\u2019s how it works: Increase your pledge by the cost of the desired add-on(s) without changing your selected reward tier. After the end of the Kickstarter campaign, you\u2019ll receive a survey where you can confirm which add-on(s) you wanted. (Note that shipping is included in the amount of the add-on.)\nWe'll be excited to reach our target goal and make an amazing experience. But we're also anticipating what it means to move beyond that goal. Kickstarter funding over the base level would be used to make Obduction bigger and better - adding such stretch goals as new places to explore, additional platforms, localization, technological bells and whistles, and more.\nVery simple: It's what we love!\nWe love the wonder of having an entirely new world at our fingertips. We love the twisted unraveling of an unexpected storyline. We love the satisfying \"Aha! moment\" of solving a particularly perplexing puzzle. We love the rush of revelation when we find out what's around the next corner. We love the twinge of emotion entering a dimly lit room because we feel like this place has become our world.\nAnd we hear from more and more people who love all of those things, too. We'd love to make it for you!\nCyan has done it all. We started with self-publishing, hand-stuffing 3.5-inch floppies into boxes. We've done full-blown publisher models, where they get 88%. And we've even done all kinds of hybrid publishing models between the two. \nCurrently, we are independent, and it feels right. It's not the Myst heyday - money has come and gone, but we've managed to stay alive as a small, independent studio through times when indie studios were falling by the wayside. And now it seems that times have changed, and indie studios are making a comeback thanks to some interesting new publishing platforms and models - including Kickstarter.\n\nSimply put, Kickstarter is a way for us to deliver a stunning experience that doesn't empty your pocketbook, while keeping us independent enough to make choices that a publisher might not understand. (Like we did with Myst 20 years ago.)\n\nInstead of a detached, corporate marketing department guaranteeing to upper management how many units they will sell to justify a budget, we'll be relying on excited fans, family, friends, and even strangers who love what we're doing and want to be part of it. The funding and the budget become part of the development process instead of being coldly handed down from an accounting officer who doesn't even know the name of the product - let alone the names of any of the real people who will be making it.\nIn addition to regular Kickstarter updates, we will be making our development process transparent and accessible to our supporters in the form of exclusive backer forums. You'll be able to interact directly with the creators, read behind-the-scenes blog posts about the ins and outs of the game's development, and stay current with our overall progress. Don't worry, we'll do our best to keep the information spoiler-free, so that you still have a rich and surprising game to explore, even if you are an avid process junkie!\nThe funding will be spent solely on Obduction. It's very straightforward: we'll spend the funds that you invest on making Obduction the best possible experience.\nWe already have a team here - a few who've been here since the Myst days, and some who are more recent. We'll be adding to the team after we get funding, so we can flesh out our design and then get started on all the new art, modeling, texturing, sounds, music, lighting, characters, interface, technology, and more.\nWe don't want that team to be too large. One thing we've learned over the years is that it can be much more efficient and satisfying to have a smaller team that works closely together. We want everyone on the team to have ownership as we design and build this experience together. And we'll make sure you know who is on the team and how things are going. \nWe've done quite a few updates since we started. Here's a list that summarizes and links to a few of the more important updates. There's lots of information you don't want to miss!\n UPDATE 4: The \"Over $450,000, reddit AMA, Bonus Q&A\u201d Update\nWe answer a lot of questions in this Update.

Learn more!\nCyan was started in 1987 by brothers Rand and Robyn Miller. They released a new kind of children\u2019s software they called The Manhole. It was a simple, whimsical, black & white world to explore with very little to get in the way of the journey. It was well received by children of all ages. The brothers followed up with Cosmic Osmo and Spelunx - two more rich, non-threatening worlds for children to explore. \n\nIn 1991, Cyan began work on Myst, a project that would take everything they had learned about making worlds and use it to create a truly unique experience for an older, more sophisticated audience. Myst was about finding yourself lost in a world and simply exploring, understanding and becoming part of the story - and the public response was nothing short of phenomenal. Sales for Myst and its sequel Riven have exceeded 12 million units worldwide - which made them the best-selling computer games of the 20th century. \nAfter five products in the Myst series, Cyan turned its attention to making an ambitious, new kind of Myst game, a never-ending world that would allow players to explore together. Uru: Ages Beyond Myst (Myst Online). It spawned a thriving, dedicated community and is still available to explore for free.\nCyan continues to draw on our past as we dream into the future. We are looking forward to creating more exciting worlds that move yet again away from the standard fare - to something unexpected.\n\nCyan is located on the northern outskirts of Spokane, Washington, about 119 trillion miles from the nearest habitable planet.\n ...And a team of other amazing and talented individuals.\n                                     *Special thanks to Strata for their generous support of the Obduction Kickstarter campaign. \n*Special thanks to Robyn Miller for use of the Myst Soundtrack music used in our video.

If we reach that, EVERY BACKER will received a free e-book of my award-nominated young adult fantasy novella, OVER THE RIM. \n$5 GETS YOU THE $10 REWARD\nGood 6/28-the end of the project, pledge $5 and get the $10 e-book reward. Yes, this means you can pre-order the Ghost Hold e-book for only $5.\nREDUCED INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING\nShipping really went up in the US this year and I've hated that I've had to ask for so much from my international backers. So, this last three days only, I am reducing all international shipping for all new backers at all pledge levels to just $10. \nBUMP UP YOUR PLEDGE\nGood 6/28-end of the project, bump up any current pledge by at least $5 and receive a surprise piece of SWAG from the PSS Series (could be a poster, bumper sticker, bracelet, or mini ghost hand).\nTHE PSS CHRONICLES\nLast year (July/August 2012) my friends, family, and fans helped make GHOST HAND, my first novel, a reality through Kickstarter. That project was 110% funded and you can see it HERE. \nGHOST HAND has been loved by many, is selling steadily, and has garnered RAVE REVIEWS on Amazon and Goodreads. Kickstarter peeps from around the world helped bring Olivia Black and her ghost hand to life. \nAnd now it is time to do it again for book two of the series, GHOST HOLD.\nGHOST HOLD: THE BOOK BLURB\nOlivia Black is back.\nOnly this time she's not the one in need of rescue.\nSamantha James, rich, popular, and an award-winning composer at age seventeen, is the next target on the CAMFers' list. And in order to convince Samantha to come with them, Olivia and Passion must pose as cousins, blend into the most affluent high school in Indianapolis, and infiltrate a mysterious cult known as The Hold.\nOlivia doesn't expect it to be easy, even with the PSS guys backing them up. But what she discovers over the course of the mission will call into question everything she has ever believed about herself, her ghost hand, and especially Marcus, the guy she is undoubtedly falling in love with. \n \nGHOST HOLD: THE COVER\nThe cover for GHOST HOLD was professionally designed by the wonderful Scarlett Rugers and was UNVEILED HERE JUNE 15th  at the halfway mark of this project. It features main characters Olivia Black, Marcus Jordon, and Passion Wainwright. \nGHOST HOLD EXCERPTS\nWant to SAMPLE the work before you buy?\nYou can read the first four chapters of GHOST HAND, book one of The PSS Chronicles, using the LOOK INSIDE FEATURE of Amazon.\nIn addition, you can read the FIRST CHAPTER OF GHOST HOLD HERE. It was unlocked to the general public thanks to the generosity and support of the project backers. BACKERS to the project at any level will also have IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO CHAPTER TWO. And CHAPTER THREE through the backer only updates section. In addition I've made available THIS steamy, romantic excerpt between Olivia and Marcus from Chapter Eight of GHOST HOLD (WARNING- if you haven't read GHOST HAND yet, this excerpt has information that could spoil a twist in book one).\nTHE AUTHOR\nI am an award-winning short story writer and Indie novelist, and I live in Portland, Oregon with one cat, two teenagers, and a man who wants to live on a boat. I don't smoke, or drink, or cuss as much as my characters. My only real vices are writing, eating M&Ms, and watching reality television.\nI LOVE being an independent, self-published writer who has complete control over my creative work. And that is made possible largely by the Kickstarter projects I do to fund the publication of my books, so thank you for considering backing me.\nHOW WILL THE MONEY BE USED?\nKickstarter is NOT a charity, and neither is this project. If you examine the pledge and reward levels to the right, you can see  you are essentially PRE-ORDERING an e-book or paperback copy of GHOST HOLD with anything over a $10 pledge. \nTraditionally published authors get an advance from a publisher in exchange for the chance to publish their book. KIckstarter is my advance. It is a way for me to fund my book projects and produce a much higher quality product than I could otherwise. \nHaving done this before, I pretty much know where the money will go and here is a basic breakdown.\n$500 for the professional book cover design\n$700 for professional editing fees\n$200 for print and e-book formatting\n$800 for the first paperback print run \n$300 for fees and shipping costs\nAny extra money earned on the project will most likely go to buy me a new laptop to write on, as my current one is on its last leg.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nNow that we've reached our initial funding goal, I've added a new reward for ALL BACKERS. If we reach $3000 by the end of the project, I'll be sending out an e-book copy of my Award-Nominated Young Adult Fantasy Novella, Over the Rim, to everyone.\nWHAT IF YOU DON'T READ YA?\nEven if you don't read or like Young Adult Fiction or the Paranormal Thriller Genre, I can guarantee you know or love someone who DOES.  Every reward level of this project can be given as a gift to someone else. Just pledge the amount for the reward you'd like to gift, and when the surveys go out to collect your information, you can let me know it is a gift and who to send it to. I'd even be happy to write a special gift message for you as well.\nWHAT TO DO NOW\nSo, you're convinced and want to be a part of making Ghost Hold a reality? Awesome, and thank you. All you have to do is click the BACK THIS PROJECT BUTTON at the top right of this page and pledge any amount over $1. Then choose your reward, follow the instructions to pay, and I'll keep you updated on the project every step of the way.\nAnd if you can't pledge today, thanks for stopping by and giving me your time, and feel free to share the project with your friends.\nSPECIAL THANKS - Special thanks to my son, Soren, for the amazing job he did on my video again.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWell, considering I finished the last project despite several large earthquakes and a move overseas and back, I don't think there is much that would stop me from finishing this book (other than being hit by a Mac truck).\n\nI think the biggest hurdle might be delays in the publication process, such as editing and formatting.

Nobody should have to endure being called a derogatory term simply because of their gender (or race, religion, or sexual orientation, for that matter). It is not only offensive to the victim and detrimental to the public image of the industry, but it also discourages countless women who want to be part of new and creative media.\nThe purpose of this documentary is to reveal the experiences of women in the gaming world, both good and bad, as well as to provide steps we can take to change the environment for the better.

I was fiction editor of OMNI Magazine and SCIFICTION and have edited more than fifty anthologies, including the annual Year\u2019s Best Fantasy and Horror for 21 years and the Best Horror of the Year for the last five years. My most recent anthologies are Blood and Other Cravings, Supernatural Noir, Teeth, and a young adult dystopian anthology titled After (with Terri Windling).\nI\u2019ve won multiple World Fantasy Awards, Locus Awards, Hugo Awards, Bram Stoker Awards, International Horror Guild Awards, and Shirley Jackson Awards for my editing. I was the recipient of the 2007 Karl Edward Wagner Award and recently honored with the Life Achievement Award given by the Horror Writers Association.\nThe business of publishing is rapidly changing. It\u2019s always been hard to sell non-themed anthologies, but in today\u2019s publishing climate, it\u2019s especially difficult. This project is close to my heart, which is why I\u2019ve decided to appeal to the public through Kickstarter in order to fund it. This is an experiment. Although I\u2019ve donated to Kickstarter projects, I\u2019ve never been involved with one before.\nFearful Symmetries will be an unthemed anthology of about 30 original stories from both veteran talent and new voices, and will be published by ChiZine Publications. I have a stable of writers whose work I love and who I regularly publish; writers like Laird Barron, Kaaron Warren, Elizabeth Hand, Lucius Shepard, Sarah Pinborough, Jeffrey Ford, Joe. R. Lansdale, and others. And while I intend to include writers like these, I also plan to have an open reading period, something I don\u2019t do often, to give a chance to new talent that I may not be aware of.\nWhile I love editing themed anthologies, there\u2019s something especially challenging and fun molding an anthology with fewer boundaries. The contributors will not be constrained by thematic chains but can write the stories they\u2019ve always wanted to and perhaps couldn\u2019t because there was no venue for them.\nI\u2019ve decided to partner with the Canadian publisher ChiZine because I enjoy what they publish and I love their production values and commitment to good-looking books. They also have excellent distribution, which means their books are available in most bookstores. Fearful Symmetries will be about 125,000 words, and will be released as a trade paperback and an e-book.\nThe money we\u2019re asking for will go toward paying the contributors professional rates, paying an artist, graphic designer, copy editor, proofreader, production costs, publicity, and of course my feline companions and I have to eat, too.\nI\u2019m really excited about Fearful Symmetries and hope you\u2019ll support its publication.\n--Ellen Datlow", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFrom Ellen Datlow:\nWhile we can\u2019t swear that the contributors who say they will write new stories will actually write those stories or write stories that are good enough to be chosen for the anthology, I have enough contacts in the publishing world to solicit writers or select stories of the same high quality to take their places should that be necessary.\n\nFrom ChiZine Publications:\nIn our going-on-five years of operating, we've never had a trade paperback book delayed past its publication date.

When I was a little girl, I thought the word, \"engineering\" was nerdy and intimidating and just for boys. I've since learned I was so wrong. Engineers build all the important things we use every day...things that make our lives better. The scary truth is that only 11% of engineers are women and girls start losing interest in science as young as age 8!  This is our chance to change that statistic.\nI'm creating GoldieBlox to inspire girls the way Legos and Erector sets have inspired boys, for over 100 years, to develop an early interest and skill set in engineering. It's time to motivate our girls to help build our future.\nMeet GoldieBlox\nGoldieBlox is a construction toy + book series starring Goldie, the kid inventor who loves to build. As girls read along, they get to build what Goldie builds. \nTarget age range: 5-9\nThe initial set includes:\nStorybook: \"GoldieBlox and the Spinning Machine\": This is the intro to Goldie, where she builds a belt drive to spin all her friends.\nCharacter Figurines: Nacho (Goldie's beloved dog), Benjamin Cranklin (the cat with an attitude), Katinka (the dolphin ballerina), Phil (the sloth), and Flavio (the bear from Brazil).  \nConstruction Set: 1 pegboard, 5 wheels, 10 axles, 5 blocks, 1 crank, 1 ribbon and 5 washers.\nBook+Toy #2 includes the \"GoldieBlox Goes to the Parade\" storybook + character figures + construction set pieces to build a parade float vehicle.\nBook+Toy #3 includes the \"GoldieBlox and the Treehouse\" storybook + character figurines + construction set pieces to build a pulley elevator.\nAll of the construction pieces in each set will be inter-compatible. Book+Toys 2 & 3 introduce medium and long axles and different lengths of ribbon. With this many construction pieces, the play opportunities are absolutely endless.\nTo get the entire series, pledge at the [GET THE WHOLE GANG -- $90] level. If we reach our $400,000 stretch goal, then we can ramp up production on Book+Toys 2 & 3 to have them shipped by April '13 and May '13, respectively. If we do not reach this goal, we will still be able to produce them...it'll just take a little longer (by August '13).\nAnd for our tech-loving girls, Goldie's stories will be available as free e-book downloads for iPhone and iPad with narration, animation and tutorial videos to truly bring Goldie to life and lend a hand to girls who aren't quite at Goldie's reading level yet.\nRewards\nThe GoldieBlox TOY\nOriginal prints signed by Debbie\nHacker Hoodie (available in adult sizes only)\nT-shirt (available in kids and adult sizes)\nBringing Goldie to Life\nGoldieBlox has come a long way. I've taken the concept from a drawing in a sketchbook to numerous working prototypes to a real toy sample in just eight short months. I partnered with Cornell researchers to test my prototypes on over 100 kids in over 40 homes and 3 schools. The testing went so well, I decided to take the leap.\nOriginal GoldieBlox prototype\nI've already partnered with an exceptional manufacturer that produced the toy sample you saw in the video. The construction parts will be made out of plastic and foam and they are getting tooled in China right now. Don't worry, I'm avoiding hazardous plastics like PVC to make sure GoldieBlox is safe for children. Plus, I'll be putting the toy through rigorous industry-standard child safety testing before it reaches your door.\nCAD Rendering of GoldieBlox\nI've spent my entire life savings to get it this far. The GoldieBlox book+toy is ready to go...all I need to do is place the production order. (This is where YOU step in.) But in order to do this, the minimum order quantity is 5000 units. Support me in this endeavor, and I will get GoldieBlox into the hands of as many little girls as possible.\nHow did I pull this off, you may ask? Well, my manufacturing is getting set up by a production expert with over 30 years experience in toys; specifically, plastic-injection-mold construction toys. I met him at my last job, a sign yet again from the universe that GoldieBlox was meant to happen. \nI've had some other folks help me out that you may have heard of...the founders of Pictionary, Cranium and Klutz Books as well as the head of toys at IDEO have all lent me their expertise. I am forever indebted to them.\nOnce you've backed me on Kickstarter, you'll get to track the progress of GoldieBlox as she gets created every step of the way on www.goldieblox.com. PLUS, you'll get to learn HOW she gets made and all the engineering principles behind it. \nDesigned for girls\nGoldieBlox goes beyond \"making it pink\" to appeal to girls. I spent a year doing in-depth research into gender differences and child development to create the concept. My big \"aha\"? Boys have strong spatial skills, which is why they love construction toys so much. Girls, on the other hand, have superior verbal skills. They love reading, stories, and characters.\nGoldieBlox is the best of both worlds: reading + building. It appeals to girls because they aren't just interested in \"what\" they're building...they want to know \"why.\" Goldie's stories relate to girls' lives. The machines Goldie builds solve problems and help her friends. As girls read along, they want to be like Goldie and do what she does. \nGoldie's toolkit is inspired by common household objects and craft items -- things girls are already familiar with. Plus, the set features soft textures, curved edges and attractive colors which are all innately appealing to girls. Last but not least, the story of Goldie is lighthearted and humorous. It takes the intimidation factor out of engineering and makes it fun and accessible. \nWhat's Next?\nThis Kickstarter project is only the beginning of what I intend to create: an entire SERIES of GoldieBlox building stories where she learns about all kinds of engineering concepts including gears, pulleys, circuits, and even coding. I want to equip girls at each age level to challenge themselves and build their dreams. To me, GoldieBlox isn't a one-off product, oh no. Help me get this first story off the ground, and we will kickstart a movement.\n***Photo credits: Susan Burdick Photography", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #15", "update_userinfo": "Brand new construction toys from GoldieBlox!", "update_content": "Dear Kickstarter backers,\nIt is with great pride today that we unveil a new line of GoldieBlox construction toys that we've spent the last 2 years developing, using all of the insights we've learned over the last 8 years on getting girls excited about STEM.
