[{"backer": "Jean-Philippe Encausse", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Introducing Gamma, the ultimate all-climate jacket. Gamma Jacket is a durable, lightweight, insulated jacket that doesn\u2019t compromise function or fashion. Building on graphene's amazing properties, Gamma is your everyday jacket, your travel jacket, your activewear, and your going-out jacket. \n\nBack us today and discover why Gamma is the only layer you'll ever need whether you're hiking the Ko\u02bbolau ranges in Hawaii or skiing in the Swiss Alps or biking to work.\nWhether you are hiking in the mountains or popping into town for a coffee, the heat-insulating design will warm you up in a matter of seconds. Gamma is the only jacket you\u2019ll need all year round, all around the globe.\nGraphene is what makes Gamma unlike any other activewear. Graphene is a nano-lattice - just one atom thick, yet it\u2019s stronger than diamond. Known as \u201csupreme graphene\u201d for its long list of properties and benefits, graphene is the thinnest, strongest, and most flexible known material.\nBy infusing a graphene layer into the Gamma Jacket, we were able to create a new kind of outerwear. Gamma functions as a winter jacket, a cool-weather jacket, a windbreaker, a rain jacket, and activewear all at once.\nWhile traditional synthetic insulation is the standard, it\u2019s nowhere near the level of warmth that a graphene-infused jacket has. Gamma takes graphene-integrated clothing to a whole new level of modern sustainability and style. Lightweight, all-seasonal, strong, and breathable.\nGraphene\u2019s thermal properties have been called revolutionary. It is able to adapt to your body almost like a second skin. Graphene moves heat through its latticed structure, evenly distributing it around your body. In warm weather, it expels heat and wicks moisture to keep you cool.\nGraphene conducts heat from your body and Gamma\u2019s built-in heaters and channels it throughout the jacket. In cold weather, it evenly distributes heat to your entire upper-body. In hot weather, it expels heat through its permeable pores.\nWith Gamma, you won\u2019t have to wear multiple layers or bulky coats. Gamma\u2019s graphene layer will regulate its temperature based on your environment, so you\u2019ll stay comfortable in temperatures from warm to frigid.\n\nFrom city strolls to hikes to snowsports, Gamma will keep you at your ideal temperature.\nGamma is equipped with 3 carbon fiber heating elements built directly into the jacket. When your body heat isn\u2019t enough, you can supercharge Gamma\u2019s graphene layer at the push of a button.\n\nWithin seconds, the heaters will begin to warm the jacket, and graphene will distribute the heat to your entire upper-body. Graphene\u2019s thermoregulating properties also ensure the jacket won\u2019t become too hot.\n\nGamma\u2019s built-in heaters will keep you warm and comfortable even in sub-zero conditions. No need for more layers, even on the coldest days.\n\nGamma\u2019s heaters are powered by any power bank. Just plug it into the USB-A input in the inner pocket and the jacket will begin to heat up.\nCombined with graphene's thermoregulating properties, unlike other materials, Gamma will never overheat or ignite. Even if you leave the heater on or fall asleep in the jacket, there is no risk of burns or overheating.\n\nGamma's built in heater comes with 3 adjustable temperature settings that you can cycle through with the press of a button to help fight every kind of cold!\nThese are estimates tested in ideal conditions and may not be precise as various conditions including temperature, your power bank's efficiency, etc. may affect the final achievable time.\nThe carbon fiber heating elements won\u2019t restrict your movement or weigh you down. Because the jacket doesn\u2019t contain any electrical parts or batteries, you can machine wash it without the risk of damage.\nGamma contains many pockets, including several hidden pockets, making it practical at home and safe while traveling. Anything you used to stuff in your tote bag can now be stored in your jacket.\nHead to the campground, office, or airport with everything you need close to your body with Gamma's secure pockets.  \n\nGamma\u2019s fit is fully adjustable to ensure your comfort and to protect you from the elements, whenever you need it.\nAdjustable drawstrings in the hood and waist lock in heat and protect against wind. \nVelcro cuffs and a high neck secure your wrists and guard sensitive skin.\nBuilt-in fingerless gloves to protect your hands without hindering your grip.\n  Tired of heavy jackets and puffy layers?\n\nGamma is the solution. Graphene isn\u2019t just the strongest known material. It\u2019s also the thinnest. At one atom thick, it\u2019s lighter than air\u2014literally. This makes Gamma incredibly lightweight and flexible\u2014perfect for folding, storing, packing, and shoving in your backpack. Traveling with Gamma can save heaps of space in your luggage, especially for minimalist backpackers.\nNote: as we continue development and prototyping, Gamma's final weight may either increase or decrease as we build out our final product and fabric mix. \nGamma weighs as much as the average hoodie. Yet, it can keep you warm as well as a thick winter coat.\nGraphene, a material stronger than diamond, can resist almost all forms of damage. It's scratch-proof, puncture-proof, tear-proof, and abrasion-proof. Feel safe in Gamma knowing you can wear it in the toughest conditions.\nGamma resists surface wear caused by rubbing or scratching, resisting scuffing or tear. You can expect Gamma to still look like fresh and new after years of heavy use.\nNote: Gamma has not been tested / certified to be bulletproof, cut-proof, or knife-proof and should never be used as a safety device. We also do not recommend as a complete replacement over a certified motorcycle jacket as it does not have padding or shielding. \nGraphene is able to expel heat without letting cold air inside the jacket, so you\u2019ll never feel that sticky, sweaty feeling you get from most shells, rain jackets, and winter coats.\nGraphene\u2019s semipermeable structure also makes Gamma the ideal jacket for warmer weather in autumn and spring. Gamma will keep you cool when the sun comes out by releasing excess heat\u2014graphene knows when to do this by detecting and reacting to your body temperature.\nIf you\u2019re using Gamma as sportswear, graphene will pull heat and moisture away from your body, moving it to the outer surface of the jacket and expelling it into the air. When you\u2019re on the slopes, jogging, or ice skating, Gamma will keep you feeling cool while maintaining your core temperature.\nDon\u2019t worry about working up a sweat in Gamma. Graphene is 100% anti-odor, meaning no odor-causing contaminants can grow on the jacket.\n\nGraphene interacts with sweat odors and neutralizes the smell through ionic conduction, efficiently removing bad smells and neutralizing any harmful substances on its surface.\nWith Gamma, never worry about your jacket smelling like sweat.\nGamma was built for unforgiving alpine conditions. Combining the naturally wind resistant and water resistant nature of Graphene's compact atomic bonds and our proprietary weave, Gamma is waterproof and windproof. \nWhether you\u2019re strolling in a light mist or stuck in a monsoon, you can count on Gamma to keep you dry and warm.\nEven though Gamma is lightweight and thin, its graphene infused technology is effective up to 50 Miles per hour / 80 Kilometers per hour winds.  Gamma is an absolute must whether you're just road biking or doing some high altitude skiing or hiking.\n\nDid you know that harmful UV rays can penetrate many light jackets, windbreakers, and raincoats? This can cause burns and skin damage when outdoors for long periods.  Gamma is UV-proof and keeps your skin safe from the sun when you're outdoors. \nGraphene repels UV light, also helping you to stay cool in the sun. \nGamma is designed and sized for a comfortable yet slim look. The tailored fit is neither too loose or too tight, creating high flexibility for the wearer. \n\nAll our sizing and designs are unisex so your sizing may not map. Make sure to take measurements. Sizing will be selected at the end of the crowdfunding campaign through surveys.\nWe charge no restocking fee for size exchanges, but customer must ship the product to us at their own expense. Depending on reshipped address, we may pass on part of the cost of reshipping up to $15-25 USD. Jacket must come back unwashed and in brand-new condition with no visible scuffs, marks, or discolorations. \nThe story of Wear Graphene started back in 2004, when graphene was first discovered. Graphene was such a monumental discovery \u2014 the strongest and thinnest material on Earth \u2014 that it earned its discoverers a Nobel Prize.\n\nAbout 10 years later, scientists first began to understand how to incorporate graphene into fabric. \n\nThis is where we come in. Our team is composed of young visionaries that want to make a change in the world by innovating new products using cutting edge materials. Our team believes that high fashion and technology can be combined to bring smart clothing to the next level.\n\nBut we knew that with graphene, our smart clothing would do more. It\u2019s also anti-odor, UV-proof, waterproof, wind-proof, damage-proof, and so much more. It\u2019s the most versatile and high-performance jacket ever made. And we think it looks pretty cool too.\n\n The Gamma! We have to fast forward to show you all the features and pockets in one go!\nPLAY\n\nUntil recently, we have focused our marketing for Gamma in Asia. Now, we would like to grow our presence overseas, starting on Kickstarter to \u201ckickstart\u201d our brand globally. Our existing supply chains and processes will allow us to manufacture and fulfill your order quickly.\n\nWe hope that you share our passion for smart and sustainable clothing and choose to become a backer of Gamma Jacket!\n\nWear Graphene is a Hong Kong-based team of scientists, designers, and business people who are dedicated to changing the way you wear clothes. With a focus on innovating through technology and sustainability, our team has developed a completely new type of graphene-infused smart clothing that we\u2019re very proud of.\n\nThe team is excited to launch our first product to a global market with Gamma Jacket.  \nThis campaign is promoted by Backercamp. Since 2012, Backercamp has helped 5,000+ creators make their projects a reality, raising over $300MM through crowdfunding.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have had ample experience in design, manufacturing, and sales in the past.

Full of LEDs, smarts and no larger than regular dice, they can be customized to light up when and how you desire. Incredibly strong, smooth and sharp, they work for several hours at a time, after which you can simply recharge them with the accompanying case. Pixels know which way they roll and can communicate with your phone or tablet via Bluetooth. This means they will work with Roll20, Foundry or any one of your favorite online platforms.\nPLAY\n\nDepending on the design you select, the LED lights will either shine through the entire face (Midnight Galaxy and Aurora Sky) or only through the numbers (Onyx Black and Hematite Grey).\nPLAY\n\nBecause of all the electronics and the battery, Pixels tend to be slightly heavier than regular dice of the same size. As a result they feel really nice in your hands, sound like proper dice, without being nearly as heavy as metal dice.\nAurora Sky Pixel next to a few other types of dice\nWe\u2019ve put a lot of effort in Pixels to make sure they are just as easy and convenient to use as regular dice. We\u2019re really excited to have been able to fit all the electronics inside such small packages.\nOnyx Black Set next to other types of dice.\nPLAY\n\nDice are made to be rolled, tossed, thrown and dropped. Fortunately, Pixels are really strong and don\u2019t expect you to be careful handling them; all the electronics are encased in very tough resin. Your Pixels will last for many years!\nBecause Pixels are cast in resin, there are no screws, no flaps, no parting lines anywhere; the dice are perfectly smooth! Programming and recharging the dice are both taken care of wirelessly, a significant technical challenge in such a small form factor, but one that we strongly believe was worth it!\n In fact, Pixels are fully waterproof! :)\nPixels are, above all, great dice for your table games. This means that balance and fair rolls are just as important to us as all the fancy electronics inside. We have dedicated a lot of time, design and testing to make sure they are as fair as possible. With a combination of small counterweights and precise attention to the finish of our edges, we\u2019ve already made Pixels surprisingly well balanced. And of course we will continue to improve the balance before release.\nPLAY\n\nFairness comparison with well-known brands (Comparison Data Credit of Mark Fickett)\nPixels speak Bluetooth. This is how the companion app communicates with the dice to reprogram them. It is also how the dice communicate back with the app to report what you rolled. In this early version of the app, we use the functionality to have your phone play sound effects based on your rolls.\nPLAY\n\nHowever the Bluetooth protocol used by the dice isn\u2019t proprietary, and many other apps will be able to talk directly to the dice as well. We are already in talks with D&D Beyond, Roll20, Foundry, and a few others to integrate Pixels directly.\nPLAY\n\nAnd while the dice can connect to your phone or computer for extra fancy features, that is not at all a requirement. Once you\u2019ve customized your Pixels, you can put your phone away and just use them for as long as you want. Or until you get tired of the color scheme and decide to try something new ;)\n\nIt was very important to us that Pixels be \u2018dice\u2019 first and foremost, and that design philosophy extends to the software side of things as well. They are just as easy to use as any other dice. Just pick them up, roll them, and they\u2019ll light up! That\u2019s it.\nThe dice use a small rechargeable battery. The battery, while absolutely tiny compared to a typical cell phone, is large enough to power the dice for several hours. In fact, in our tests, we\u2019ve averaged 5 hours of use on a single charge. And if you only use Bluetooth but don't have the dice light up, then you can easily record more than 20,000 rolls on a single charge (Check out the video in the Balance section).\nPLAY\n\nOnce your session is over, Pixels will recharge conveniently in the accompanying case. Every single Pixel will come with its own charging case, and every set will come with a larger one.\nPlace the die in its case. Make sure the highest face is up (20 in the case of the D20) and it will recharge in an hour or so.\nThe lid of the case contains a small magnet that will prevent the dice from turning on and lighting up during transport. Don\u2019t get us wrong, glowing pockets are cool and all, but not being able to flex your flashy dice isn\u2019t; we wouldn\u2019t wish that on anyone.\nBattery Voltage over ~1000 rolls.\nThe To-Go case next to the standard individual case.\nAny 7-dice set you get will come with a To-Go carrying case. This larger case has its own battery, and room for 8 dice. It will be able to recharge all your dice 2 or 3 times before needing to be recharged itself. Great for when you are not necessarily close to an outlet or if you just want to keep your dice topped-up while you play.\nPLAY\n\nThe case will let you carry any set of dice. Want a full set? No problem. Need to have 8D6 for some reason? You got it! The case and individual chargers both use the same insert system, so you can customize the dice layout as much as you want.\nPLAY\n\nPixels are completely customizable. Thanks to the accompanying app, you are in control of how the dice light up. Want to create a quick colored theme? No problem! Prefer a colorful set of patterns instead. Go right ahead! Using the accompanying app, you can control exactly how the dice light up and when.\nPLAY\n\nUsing a Condition -> Action system (similar to IFTTT) you can describe exactly under what condition you want the dice to light up or even your phone to play sounds (if connected).\nPLAY\n\nAt any time you can easily preview your creation directly on a die and make sure the result is exactly what you want.\nRoll20, Foundry and D&D Beyond are all working with us to ensure Pixels are supported on their platforms.\nWe are also discussing potential integration with Fantasy Grounds.\nIn addition to the planned Official Integrations, we are committed to keeping the Pixels' API completely Open Source and available on Github.\nAll of Pixels Software and Firmware code is available on GitHub.\nThis means that even if we are not supporting your favorite platform directly, you will be able to use 3rd party integrations, or even better, write your own.\n\nPixels will allow developers to write their own apps, and do that even for commercial purposes. If you are interested in writing games / apps / integrations that use Pixels, consider one of our limited Devkit D20 Addons.\nIf you are a developer, grab one of the D20 Devkit Addons and receive a sample shortly after the campaign ends.\nAlthough every Pixel can be used as a Dev Kit, if you grab one of those addons, you will receive an Early D20 so you can get a head start on development.\nPixels are not only Open Source, but also Open Hardware! Pixels wouldn\u2019t exist without the open-source and open-hardware communities, and so we think it the right thing to do to share our work as well.\nPixels Design Files are also Open Source\nMost of the design files are already available on Pixels Hackaday.io project page, along with multiple prior prototypes and documentation of our adventures getting to the final versions of the dice.\nThe \"core\" of a D20 Pixel\nIf you are interested in using Pixels, have a question or suggestion for future updates, or just want to show your support, stop by our Discord!\nThis is also the place were we tend to share the most up-to-date developments. \n\nPixels have also appeared in the following publications:\nPixels use RGB LEDs that are individually controlled to give you the most flexibility possible. Choose dice that will either glow entirely (brighter overall), or only through the numbers (more readable when lit) and let your creativity decide how they light up. \nClick on the image below to check out high-res pictures of all the available designs.\nHead over to the Pixels website to see High-Resolution pictures.\n\nCan't quite find the exact combination of dice you need? Add one or two more singles to your pledge. \n Eager to start integrating Pixels with your app? Grab one of the limited Early Devkits!\nAll the rewards consist of a combination of Single dice and 7-dice sets. For instance, if you pledge at the 1 Die level, you get 1 single die. If you pledge at the Set level, you get 1 set. If you go for a 2 Set + 2 Dice, you get 2 sets and 2 singles. What those singles and sets are is up to you! You get to pick the size and design of each.\nIf you are not able to get exactly the combination you want from the rewards, we will also offer Addons. Want a Standard Set with 2 extra dice? No problem: Back at the Byte level and tack on an extra Single die! All Addons will ship at the same time as your rewards.\n\nNot sure which level to back at? Here are some suggestions:\nPlease note that the rates below are estimates, exact shipping costs will depend on your country and shipping speed. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the first physical product that we will be bringing to market, so there is no question that many challenges are still ahead of us. This is why we have been working with a manufacturing partner to help us through the process and pair us with reputable and reliable manufacturers. At this point, we have two manufacturers lined up and able to begin production.\n\nBased on the feedback we got from factories, we expect to ship rewards in 12 months. However, please understand that this is an estimate. While we hope start delivering rewards sooner, we fully expect to have many issues along the way, no matter how hard we try to avoid them, and so it possible that it will take us longer to finish production. After all, getting this far was anything but easy and there is no reason to think that things should change during production! :)\n\nWe are, however, committed to making Pixels a reality and to keep the entire process transparent. This was a passion project before it was a product, and seeing the excitement spread throughout the community has almost given us a sense of duty to making flashy-connected-dice happen in the open.

But smell? Not really! \nSmell Inspector is a developer\u2019s kit and ready-to-use electronic nose gadget in one. For anyone working on smart systems - from developers or scientists to tinkerers. Immediately usable for manufacturers who want to control their production environment and the quality of their products.\nSmell inspector is a digital nose, which works with the same principle as a human nose. Train it and create your own specific use case for single gases, gas mixtures or smells.\n\nComponents\nSmell Inspector\nThe gadget contains Smell Board iX16\u00d74 with four Smell iX16 detectors, can be connected to a PC, tablet or smartphone and can be operated with the Smell Annotator software. Compatible with Arduino and Raspberry Pi.\nSmell Board iX16x4\nElectronic board with four Smell iX16 detector chips, providing full functionality to read signals from all 64 individual detectors every 1.8 s and send them out in ASCII format. Can be integrated into different mobile or stationary appliances. \nSmell iX16\nThis is our core invention: The first multi-channel gas detector chip designed to conquer the mass market. The sensor elements contain fine-tuned carbon nanomaterials which make the chip highly sensitive, small, energy efficient and affordable. There are four Smell iX16 detector chips on the electronic board. The current version has 64 detectors (16 channels per detector chip) with a size of less than 1sqmm (0.08sqinch) each. Further miniaturization and / or increasing the number of detectors can easily be done. The detector chip Smell iX16 only needs 1 \u00b5W of power supply. It can thus be powered by various host devices, energy harvesters or batteries. Smell iX16 is designed for use in unlimited miniaturized electronic and IoT applications in various areas. The detector chip has a high sensitivity to different gases and VOCs.\nSmell Annotator\nSmell Annotator is an AI based software used to detect, annotate and digitize smells with the Smell Inspector as well as to recognize annotated smells. Digital smell patterns are produced by 64 independent gas detectors. Through artificial intelligence our technology learns to recognise particular smells. This can be compared to the way information is processed in our olfactory system. Smell is initially collected and analysed in the olfactory bulb. For recognition and remembering the cortical brain areas get involved. This evolves over our whole lifetime with more and more \u201edata\u201c processed. The same principle is realized in the Smell Inspector supported with the Smell Annotator software which uses machine learning algorithms.Currently, Windows and Linux systems are supported. Android and iOS will follow.\nGoals\nIntroduce an innovative product with a disruptive technology to the market\nOffer a low cost embedded platform for smell detection and recognition\nProvide companies with a great tool for fast prototyping of products related to smell\nEnable engineers, researchers, designers, makers, tinkerers, software developers\u2026 to create new products and services in relation to smell\nGive a boost to the maker\u00b4s world / DIY community\nBuild up a worldwide developer\u2019s community for smell related applications\nCreate a world\u2019s largest digital smell database\nSingle Pack: Pick a single Smell Inspector Developer's Kit to build your unique smell-related application and start the digital smell revolution.\nExplorer Set: Connect to your friends, makers, developers, scientists and choose your Explorer Set to invent great smell-related applications and products in a common, open and creative lab environment.

It is a joint effort of a multidisciplinary team of researchers and industry experts with expertise in physics, chemistry, electrical engineering, bioengineering, software development, industrial engineering, marketing and business development in collaboration with the German excellence university TU Dresden and German Life Science Inkubator, who along the years have worked together in several projects sharing the same vision about smell recognition.\nFrom the left: Marcel H\u00e4ndler (M.Sc.), Julius Hickl, Viktor Bezugly (Ph.D.), Birte S\u00f6nnichsen (Ph.D.), Vyacheslav Khavrus (Ph.D.), Andreas Werner (M.Sc.)\nWhatever happens on the way \u2013 we will keep you informed. \nBuilding a hardware product is hard and we may face unforeseen events that are going to delay us. As we have done in the past on our Facebook and LinkedIn page and our email list, you can count on one thing: we will always keep you updated on our status and potential delays at least one update per month on Kickstarter.\n\n Technology Evolution\n5 generations of detector chips, 3 generations of PCB, 3 versions of software - from research to product\nThe technology is based on more than 10 years of research at TU Dresden which is a reputable German university. We have produced several kinds of prototypes (detector chips as well as circuit boards) as it can be seen in the pictures above. Currently we are in the middle of the process of producing our first serial sample. To this end we are working together with Turck duotec a renown German EMS company. Current pilot projects are underway at Turck duotec GmbH, the American sensor manufacturer Centaur Analytics Inc. as well as at the German renown technical universities TU Dresden and TU Munich.\nTesting the first printed detector chips on foil mounted on the second generation Demo Board in our gas measuring chamber.\nThe laboratory and measuring equipment has been designed and manufactured in-house and is the result of an intense thinking process and hard working hours in the laboratory.\nPreparing the equipment for the in-house production of our nanomaterials. The production and fine-tuning of the nanomaterials for the detector chips Smell iX16 is one  of our key know-hows.\nWe have intensely analysed different kinds of smells. Using a simplified smell testing setup we could reliably test different gases, VOCs and smells: \ngases and VOCs: ammonia, nitrogen monoxide, phosphine, carbon dioxide, water vapour, ethanol, acetone (and other ketones), isopropanol, toluene, hydrogen peroxide, formaldehyde, 2,6-dimethaxy-phenol, 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol, guaiacol;\nsmells: different perfumes, chocolate, wine, vodka, coffee, tee, lemon juice, onion, garlic, banana, orange, potato, meat, fish (also spoiled banana, orange, potato, meat and fish), trash container.\nThe boards that you see on the pictures are real working prototypes tested by us and our partners. We are 80% ready to have the final product in our hands.\nThe production will follow these steps:\nComponents purchase\nWarehouse\nSMT\nAOL\nSmell iX16 detector chip production\nQuality control for Smell iX16\nComplete system assembly\nTests\nQuality control packaging\nShipping\nBack us now and help us make the Smell Inspector a reality!\nThe board design is in the final stage and our engineers are checking the electrical schematics and all the components to finalize the PCB development. Nevertheless, the Smell Inspector is not yet ready for the final users, as we still have some tasks regarding  the hardware and software:\nvalidation of Prototype B of the hardware,\nproduction of the test series,\nextending Smell Annotator software to Android and iOS,\nupscaling the quality control for the Smell iX16 detector chip production,\nextending our pre-set data collection to include smells for the most requested community application (stretch goal 1),\nsetting up and standardizing the digital smell database (stretch goal 2).\nKicking off a big production entails high set-up costs. As a startup company, we can only get it done with your help. Next to building our community this is why you are so important to us: Only if enough supporters back our project by pre-ordering the Smell Inspector, we will have enough funding to produce, assemble and ship the Smell Inspector. With a treshold of \u20ac27,800 ($33,760)we would be able to validate prototype B of the Smell Inspector and start the production of the test series. \nIf all goes as planned, we will be able to complete production on schedule, ship the Smell Inspector to you in November 2021 and build a worldwide Smell Inspector community.\nSo \u2013 are you ready to become a Smell Inspector yourself?\nSpread the word! Encourage friends to become a Smell Inspector, too! \nThank you for being part of the smell digitization evolution!\nThe Kickstarter video was produced with support by ravir FILM.

We fine-tuned every bit to fit agile maneuverability into a palm-sized robot pet. You can bring Bittle to life by assembling its puzzle-like frame and downloading our demo codes on GitHub. You can also teach it new skills to win prizes in our community challenges. Bittle makes a perfect tool for learning, teaching, researching, or a surprising gift to impress your family and friends. Bittle is not a toy for small kids. We recommend parental guidance to appreciate its rich content and avoid damage or injury.\nBittle walking on the desk\nEvolving with an open-source gene, Bittle is an open platform to fuse multiple makers' gadgets into one organic system. With our customized Arduino board coordinating all instinctive and sophisticated movements, you can clip on various sensors to bring in perception. You could also inject artificial intelligence capabilities by mounting a Raspberry Pi or other AI chips through wired/wireless connections.\nBall tracking with an intelligent camera mounted on the head\nBittle is the second product of OpenCat, sibling of Nybble. Backed by a worldwide user group, you can find many tutorials and project ideas on the Internet. We make constant but tiny progresses every day. You can follow our social media (Instagram/Twitter @PetoiCamp) to get more frequent updates than newsletters. By posting on our forum, you can contribute to the community or simply make your wishes heard. We are always drawing the blueprint for futuristic robots! \nSelf-righting after falling from a slope (triggered by an infrared remote)\nBittle is a palm-sized robot that moves with four legs rather than wheels. Legged motion gives it more freedom to navigate unstructured terrains, and expresses the joy of life whenever it moves. Such dynamic maneuverability was only seen on a few luxury robots from the best labs or tycoon companies previously, such as Boston Dynamics Spot or Sony Aibo. We came up with a grassroots solution to simplify the system to make it affordable and mass-producible.\nWalk the dog. Click the image to see a longer clip.\nBittle is a compact system of five major components: body frame, actuator, electronics, battery, and the software to coordinate all the hardware to perform varied tasks. \nBody frame\nWe designed Bittle's interlocking frame as a 3D puzzle with very few screws involved. Most body parts are symmetric for simplicity and aesthetics.  \nPuzzle-like body frame. Click the image for the full assembling animation.\nIt's a pleasure to assemble and disassemble Bittle for teaching or maintenance. On average, it takes about one hour to put together the body from scratch.\nBuild a robot dog on your own!\nEach piece has gone through tens of iterations with 3D printing. We then use high strength injection-molded plastic to provide the best protection from collision and dust (it's NOT waterproof!). In the stress tests, the assembled robot can take an adult's stepping without breaking any components (do NOT try this at home!).  \nRolling down a step. Click the image for the full review video.\nWe also designed Bittle to be soft. Besides the elasticity of the material, the spring-loaded upper legs flatten the shock on joint servos to protect their gears. Bittle usually survives regular collisions. In the extreme cases, it will disintegrate at the designated \"weak link in the chain\", which is easy and cheap to reinstall or replace.\nPassive compliant joints\nWe designed the frame to be compatible with most 9g servos. You could order the \"Bittle Shell\" perk alone to compile your spare servos into a beautiful action figure!\nActuator\nWe visited several servo manufacturers and iterated many times to find the optimized parameters. It will be model P1S, a slim, fast servo with a controllable angle of 270 degrees.\nP1S servo\nWe use nine P1S servos to actuate Bittle. Eight of them are for walking joints, and one is for head panning. We will also include one spare servo for replacement, as brushed motors are consumable after a certain period of wearing. You may order the \"Bittle Servo Set\" perk if you expect to use Bittle intensively for teaching or researching.\nElectronics\nBittle is driven by NyBoard V1, a customized Arduino board with rich peripherals. We fully utilized the chip of a regular Arduino Uno to coordinate sophisticated motions. The board can drive at least 12 PWM servos, and an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) is used for balancing. It stores \"muscle memory\" and detects body status (orientation and acceleration) for balancing. We provide an infrared remote to trigger basic movements. The board also listens to string commands from the serial port, such as \"walk\", \"sit\", or more detailed instructions for individual joints. \nNyBoardV1\n\nNyBoard V1 is a revision of NyBoard V0 that has been driving 2000 Nybbles all over the world. We continue to provide a 2x5 socket on NyBoard V1 for mounting Raspberry Pi. It powers the Pi and communicates with it through the serial or I2C network. The Pi gives Bittle the ability to analyze more sensory data, get connected to the Internet, and make decisions by itself. Due to Bittle's small size, it best fits Pi Zero and Pi 3A+. For larger Pi models, you will need to tilt the Pi and 3D print some supporting structures. \nRaspberry Pi 3 A+ and Pi camera on Bittle\nThanks to the Arduino and Raspberry Pi community, you can find many customization ideas for Bittle. There are four Seeed Grove sockets on NyBoard V1 for extensible modules. To make installation easier, we designed Bittle's head as a clip to bite on those modules. That explains why we created a dog out of OpenCat this time. We will compile a \"sensor pack\" perk, including an intelligent camera module, a gesture sensor, a PIR motion sensor, and some other useful sensors. There's also a screw hole inside Bittle's head for fixing additional modules. \nExtensible modules\nWe developed a Bluetooth dongle for wirelessly uploading codes and controlling Bittle from PC or smartphone Apps. We also developed a WiFi dongle for wirelessly communicating with Bittle. You can play with Bittle without messing around with cables. Wireless is also essential when you are studying balancing related motion planning. You can even utilize the computational power of a remote \"brain\" without being constrained by Bittle's size and cargo capacity. The dongles are compatible with our previous Nybble model. We will include one extra set for our Nybble backers as a \"Thank You\" gift. You will need to provide your email and order ID for Nybble in our later survey.  \nBluetooth and WiFi dongles\nFurthermore, we are developing an ESP32 development board with native Bluetooth and WiFi connectivity. We have made a functional beta version called the \"BiBoard V0\" perk for developers. We expect a considerable performance boost, and you are welcome to join our exploration.\nBiBoard V0\nSoftware\nBittle is driven by our OpenCat code. It has 3K lines of Arduino codes excluding 3rd party libraries. It defines the minimal data structure and algorithms for performing quadruped motion. We also provide example commander and parser in Python so that you can send instructions from other devices. The code is already running on thousands of small quadruped robots, including many variants of OpenCat.  \nThe OpenCat codes are open source on Github\nYou can program Bittle at different levels in various coding environments, such as C in Arduino IDE and Python in the terminal. We are collaborating with TinkerGen, a STEM education company that kindly developed Codecraft (a graphical coding environment) for Bittle. They will also provide a free curriculum for you to learn programming in Codecraft and create a wide array of educational and fun projects with it!\nYou can code in Arduino IDE, Python, Codecraft, and many other environments\nWe plan to refactor Bittle's code between the production and release it before Bittle's delivery. You may start to explore the current OpenCat repository on GitHub to get familiar with the framework. We will announce new community challenges with huge prizes in the community section!   \nBittle climbing up a step under realtime instructions sent through Bluetooth\nBattery\nWe designed a Li-ion battery pack with a built-in charging and protection circuit. It can slide into the track underneath Bittle and tune its center of mass. It can power Bittle for at least one hour of continuous walking. It also has an RGB LED to indicate the battery's status.\nLi-ion battery with onboard charging and protection circuit\nWith the slide-in installation mechanism and an anti-reverse plug, it's not too hard to switch batteries. You may order extra batteries for uninterrupted researching or playing. With some reconfiguration, it can also power our previous Nybble models.\nYou can check this 30-min interview by Hackster.io for all the cool features. \nBittle is a perfect example to show \"small is big\". We wanted to encourage people to free their creativity and make wonderful things from limited resources. We have a growing community since the release of the OpenCat demo. We have @petoicamp on social media to update our fans about the progress of the project. After the launch of Nybble, we built the forum on our site (petoi.com) to discuss the project, showcase DIY models, and add function modules. \nPetoi Camp, the OpenCat forum\nLooking back at all the challenges we went through, the community was the most significant support that encouraged us to continue. We got thousands of backers to bring Nybble to life. Fans all around the world volunteered to translate our documentation into their languages. And many developers added new features to OpenCat. We cannot wait to see what Bittle will bring to us!  \nAn Android App (Code&Robots) developed by one of our fans\nTo make our community more productive, educational, and rewarding, we will launch an online challenge for all OpenCat users. You can find our proposed rules in this forum post and give suggestions before it officially starts. In short, we will define several tasks that can be measured quantitatively, e.g., programing Bittle to get onto the highest step. You have to both demo your solution and teach others to validate your entry. On the first day of each month, we will announce the world's record-breaker and gift a free Bittle or Nybble to the winner!\nWho will be the first Bittle backflipper and enter our Hall of Fame?\nBittle standing on my fingers\nBittle is 20cm x 11cm x 11cm in dimension. It weighs less than 280g but can carry up to 450g cargo under its belly. With proper programming and calibration, It can run faster than two body lengths per second. Bittle can remember tens of instinctive motion patterns and can perform more fancy tricks with realtime instructions. \nBittle (250g) trotting with an iron cargo (465g)\nP1S servo uses a coreless motor, alloy gears, ball bearing, and plastic case. It's 8.4V compatible, high speed, and has a controllable range of 270 degrees.  \nBittle on a treadmill\nNyBoard V1 has an Atmega328P with 16MHz CPU, 2K SRAM, and 32K flash. We also added an 8K I2C EEPROM, an IMU, a servo driver for 12 PWM servos, an infrared receiver, and a buzzer. It has a 2x5 socked to mount on a Raspberry Pi. \nBiBoard V0 has an ESP32 with 240MHz dual-core CPU, 520KB SRAM, and up to 16M flash. It has built-in WiFi/Bluetooth, 12 PWM servo pins, an IMU, an infrared receiver, an audio amplifier, and a speaker. It has several communication ports to connect to other devices.  \nThe Bluetooth dongle is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Android. It can also work on IOS with some auxiliary software. It can be used for uploading Arduino sketch or communicating with the NyBoard. The WiFi module can host a simple WebUI and communicate with the NyBoard. \nBiBoard V0, NyBoard V1 with Raspberry Pi 3 A+, and NyBoard V1 with a Bluetooth dongle\nThe intelligent camera module is our ODMed product. It integrates multiple vision recognition algorithms running on its ESP32 dual-core processor. It can return recognized human body, objects, and symbols through serial/I2C/WiFi at a rate of 25fps or 50fps. It can even stream video through WiFi. We will also include a deck of symbol cards. You can refer to this link for more information.\nIntelligent camera module and the symbol deck\nWe compiled the sensor pack with Seeed studios' Grove modules. You can refer to this link for more information. \nWe have been residing in the factory for six months and commit to staying until we start to ship Bittles.    \nSpark Erosion Machining (EDM) for making precise molds\nWe have finished 95% percent of the injection molds of the body frame. The lead time for injection production is one week. More funds are required to make the mold for the optional silicone tail and paws. The lead time is one month. We will provide their 3D printing files if they cannot catch up in time. We are still optimizing the parameters of servos for longer life-span. The lead time is at least two months. NyBoard V1 and battery are production-ready, and the suppliers are waiting for down payments for mass production. The lead time is 45 days to 50 days. We also need to design a sturdy and compact packaging box for international shipping. The lead time is one month. \nProduction schedule\nOpenCat started as the founder Rz Li's pet project in 2016. After the demo video went viral in 2018, he devoted all his time and resources to bring this sophisticated and cute robot to the public. He founded Petoi and successfully crowdfunded the Nybble project in 2018. All the earnings have been put into the fulfillment of Nybble and the R&D of Bittle.\nWe are still fulfilling Nybble orders for a worldwide audience\nOur mission is to bring affordable robotic pets from fiction to reality. We grew from a single maker to a company that can collaborate and negotiate with manufacturers to get the best solutions to our needs. We have many more cool ideas in mind, and Bittle is another small step towards our ideal shape of household robots.\nNybble and Bittle\nYou can help to bring this project to life by backing a wide selection of perks. The main perk for this campaign is the Bittle kit, available from $195 for early bird backers. We will include a free set of wireless dongles for our former Nybble backers.\nBittle kit (the final contents are subject to change)\nBecause there's no shopping cart on Kickstarter to combine your orders, you can refer to the following tables and compare their contents. Pick your base perk, then add the price of your add-on items to your pledge amount during checkout. You will also need to pay the shipping of your base perk during checkout. The extra shipping cost will be covered by us! Make sure you take note of what you ordered! \nTable of perks\nYou can decide your base(composite) perk from the following table, then add extra items according to your needs. \nContents of composite perks\nYou will also need to provide your account ID and payment method to secure your pledge. Kickstarter campaign is an \"all or nothing\" game. Your credit card will only be charged if we can meet the campaign goal during the period. You will receive a survey for your shipping address and other information, such as your preferred color, add-on items, and your Nybble backer ID. \nWe will ship your packages from our Chinese factory with reliable international couriers. Your government will collect the customs tax/fees upon delivery. Note: It can be expensive for some countries and areas. We are very grateful for your support and hope to bring you a unique product ASAP!\nIt has been a fantastic launch! With only a short notice of prelaunch, our initial goal of $50,000 was fulfilled within one day! It is a historical moment for me, for Petoi, and for everyone who loves robotics!\nA brief celebration on the factory's roof\nReaching the original funding goal will help us continue finalizing the R & D of Bittle. We just paid for the mold of silicone tail and paws, and will include them as standard components in the Bittle kit. But we need more funds to pay retainage, prepare for the inventory, break-even, and pay ourselves.\nBody language of \"excitement\"\nPlease shout out to your friends and network that we are setting a STRETCH GOAL at $200,000.  If we meet our stretch goal, we will gift one Grove module in the Bittle kit (even if you didn't back the sensor pack) to encourage you to utilize Bittle's extensible features. Of course, the module should not overlap with the sensor pack. You can browse this list and tell us your favorite. We will pick the most popular one. \nKickstarter is an open platform that reaches different kinds of people with varying interests. Bittle is an open platform to help people realize many dreams in robotics. We have a perfect match in user groups, and the resonance can make our ideas better heard by the world. We are highly interested in your feedback on the design, and how you will train and hack Bittle.\nWe also need your help! We focus so much on Bittle's deliverables that we barely have the budget for ads and marketing. We need your voice to spread out the news to reach more people. The more orders we get, the more leverages we have to negotiate with suppliers for the best quality and production priority. The more users we have, the more fun you get when everyone pitches in and builds applications upon Bittle.\n  Dr. Rongzhong Li (Rz)\nFounder and CEO \nRz is a physics PhD and computer science master. He previously taught computer science at Wake Forest University.\nRz is a maker with broad interests in art, literature, and science.

He helps supervise Petoi's management and development.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHardware products are especially \"hard\" to deliver compared to pure software products. After two years of experience with Nybble, we foresee the following risks and are working hard to mitigate them. \n \n* Supply chain, cash flow, and inventory management\nAny delay in the supply chain could halt production at any stage. We try to solve this by carefully estimating the lead time and divide sequential dependency into parallel processes, and moving the most challenging tasks to our top priority. \n \nNow we need the final push to finalize the designs and make down payments to kick off mass production. However, Kickstarter funding is an \"all or nothing\" game, and the funds will only arrive weeks after the campaign. So we lowered the funding goal a bit to negotiate with our manufacturer earlier during the campaign. They can start to prepare the materials earlier, given our crowdfunding progress. \n\nThis time we include batteries to avoid users' confusion in picking the right ones. However, the production for 2S Li-ion batteries requires an MOQ of 5000 units. It's a sizeable one-time investment, and the storage of many batteries is also risky. We will rent a dedicated room to store the batteries. We will also optimize the production process to reduce the lagging period between stocking and shipping the batteries. \n\n* Certificates and international shipping \nBittle needs to go through several standard tests for importing and exporting certifications. The tests may take up to two months after we send the final products. We took the advice from our experienced manufacturers that the specifications should not be too exceptional. We will reserve Bittle's full dynamic potential to make it a more stable product. \n\nThe breakout of COVID-19 is adding another layer of uncertainty for production and shipping. The factories are subject to close should any case was reported in the area. The international couriers are also having a hard time arranging oversea shipments. There may be a longer wait time between our shipping date and the delivery on your side. \n \nWe will ship Bittles worldwide through international couriers that can provide reliable tracking. Backers will be responsible for paying customs and duties. The amount varies by country or region. We may have a few customers canceling their orders if the fees upon delivery are too high. So we want to make sure everyone knows about the shipping policy before they order. \n\n* Team development\nWe currently have two people working full-time on the project.

When time is up, the very side with heavier goods to the balance scale (the side of the balance is lower) wins.\nMagnetic Crane - Transferring Race\n\u2696\ufe0fThe players can use the magnetic crane kit to scramble for the goods in the central area and move them to your own stacking area.\nThe game is over when all the goods are moved out. The very side who moves heavier goods wins.\n\ud83d\ude21Build a 3\u00d74 wooden block wall in the Obstacle Area. Players will take turns to throw wooden cubes using Armpal robot arm and try to destroy the wooden block wall.\nA total of 3-N rounds are performed according to the number of players (the wooden block wall should be restored after each throw).\n1 point for each block shot, the player with the highest score wins!\n\ud83d\udca3Build a 3\u00d74 wooden block wall in the Obstacle Area. Players will take turns to throw wooden cubes and try to put them into the Armpal Scale Box controlling the robot arm, 5 throws for each player.\n3 points for Box 1, 10 points for Box 2, and -5 points for accidentally knocking down obstacle blocks.\nThe player with the highest score wins when all the throws are done!\n\ud83c\udfc69 Blocks in the Kick Off Area for each player to carry the wooden blocks to the Scoring Areas within the 3-min game. Successful transportation to the right areas gain points, and the player with the highest score wins when time\u2019s up!\nEach successful placement of a wooden block in the Central Area will get 1 point. The 3-Points Area and 5-Points Area are the Scramble Areas, and the very side with the block at the top of the pile in these areas when time\u2019up will get the corresponding scores.\nWhen players accidentally knock down the wood cubes which are already in the Scramble Areas, corresponding points should be taken from their final scores.\n\ud83e\udd1dTwo people operate a device (each person with one of the 2 handles) simultaneously , each group of players transports wooden blocks from the Stacking Area to the Central Area within the 3-min game, and the group with more wooden blocks wins when time\u2019s up.\n\ud83e\udd1c\ud83e\udd1bPlayers will pass the wooden blocks in a circle controlling their Armpals.\nWatch out! Don\u2019t drop it!\nThe 2 players who dropped the wooden block while passing it will fail the game and the other 2 players win!\n The new Cannon Kit emphasizes the sense of simulation like the existing kit, so it will have a firing principle that is completely different from other firearm model toys \u2014\u2014 this might probably the closest one to real ammunition in the current market!\nFor the new cannon kit, we designed ammunition containing bullet, case, primer, and even powder (replaced by spring energy storage). At the same time, we designed the components for delivery and return. And also, a series of institutions of shelling (throwing shells).\nIn addition to controlling the aiming of the robotic arm during operation, you will also use the two triggers on the handle of the control unit, one of which is used to fire and the other is used to deliver the bomb. 5 Rounds of ammunition can be loaded at once. \n *The Cannon Kit is currently undergoing verification and finishing work, will be available for purchase at special price for ALL BACKERS ON KICKSTARTER on pledge manager when the campaign ends. \nArmpal is a set of wooden assembled, non plug-in tabletop game.\nReducing the difficulty of the assembly process to the lowest level, the most complicated tool you\u2019ll use is only a screwdriver, which make ArmPal well-adapted to a very wide age range.\nWe have designed a multi-axis operating system for Armpal that is beyond imagination. \nYou can easily use your hands to cooperate with the manipulation machinery to complete complex operations.\nIf you want to experience the joy of manipulating machinery without leaving home, this set of tabletop game must be a very good choice.\nAs a set of mechanical-themed tabletop game, you can find armpal ingeniously integrates gear transmission, hydraulic transmission, pulleys, magnets, and multiple mechanisms. \nThe visualized design enable us to enjoy the whole working process of movements with all the beautiful mechanical structures.  \n\nThe optimization of the production process is also an important part of the design work.\nThe laser cutting of the main wood knot structure can ensure smooth edges, and makes it easy to be taken apart without tools.\nFor better gaming experience and longer life of the mechanical structure, we\u2019ve done a lot of work. Besides the strengthened structure and decreased wear and tear, special windows were designed to maintain the hydraulic transmission system with simple steps.\nIn just a few steps, the entire hydraulic system can be rejuvenated to counteract possible liquid evaporation.\n Our designers try to assign hand-made models to the attributes of the game. Such products can bring people back to the real world from mobile phones and the Internet, increasing face-to-face communication between people.\nThe time spent playing with family or friends is full of happiness. And what is even more amazing is that this game is made by yourselves!\n This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.\nCrossprom.com lets you find matching cross-promotion friendly campaigns, streamline partnerships, follow schedules and mentions, retarget your visitors, and increase your conversions.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur design team has a rich product experience.

You need a simple cutting edge, but there\u2019s none within easy reach. We designed Dagr specifically for that situation, to be the knife that\u2019s always with you wherever you go. It\u2019s compact enough to ride along amongst your keys, but sharp enough to help with your everyday cutting tasks.\nDagr is engineered to protect it's blade when not in use with a tightly-threaded protective cap. When closed, it can be easily attached to your key ring, carabiner or shock cord \u2013 what ever carrying method you prefer. When needed, it can be unscrewed from its cap and either used alone for maximum flexibility or be re-attached to the cap to create a longer, more substantial grip area if needed.\nWhen not in use as a knife, Dagr is an always ready, non-contact tool for use in public spaces, activating elevator buttons, light switches, gas pumps and ATM\u2019s.  Both Stainless and Titanium are easily disinfected when needed.\nDagr\u2019s blade and cap parts are each CNC turned from solid 304 stainless steel or grade 5 Titanium stock. 304 Stainless is a preferred grade for use in the production of surgical instruments, Grade 5 Titanium is a favorite of the aircraft industry for its additional strength and lighter weight. Both are ideal materials for the job, will last forever.\nRegardless of size, knives are all about blade sharpness and the ability to cut stuff when needed. Dagr\u2019s blade is .5\u201d (12mm) long and .07\" ( 2mm) thick, allowing it to be used both for paper-thin materials and heftier, thicker materials like cardboard, leather or even twine & lanyard cord. TSA does not allow any sharp objects on planes, but Dagr can be places in checked luggage. Details can be found here! \nDagr's permanent blade can be easily re-sharpened with any whetstone, providing many years of service.\nOur shop is ready to begin production as soon as the project ends and can produce several hundred Dagrs per week. Though we will begin shipping as soon as parts are complete, we setting August as our target to begin shipping, and shipments will continue as parts arrive.\nOur worldwide shipping method will be by US Post. We've had a very high success rate with USPS on our past projects, but please note that we will not be able to track shipments beyond the US border. We'd be happy to make alternative shipping arrangements with tracking at an additional cost if you require - just let us know.\nBy supporting this project you will not only receive an AWESOME knife, but you will be helping to keep a small community of independent shops (including ours!) up and running in these challenging times. Our future success as creators here on Kickstarter depends on making sure our local independent shop ecosystem is able to pull through this shut down. It\u2019s a good cause and we all appreciate of your support!\nFor those of you new to our projects, our name 'Onehundred' comes from the 100 mile radius around our Saxonville, MA studio where we seek out talented New England manufacturers, many are 50+ year old independent shops. Manufacturing locally not only insures quality and helps maintain a stable manufacturing community, it also lowers our carbon footprint by about 60% by not having to ship materials or finished parts around the world.\nLearn more: onehundred.co", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have been working with all of our local production partners for several years now. They do quality work and being that they are close by, we're able to visit them often to resolve any issues if they arise. The biggest risk to beginning shipping on the stated date, though, is their production capacity and scheduling of other work at the time of our actual order. \n\nOccasionally, our smaller production runs may be delayed in favor of larger orders - a variable we can't always control. We never know in advance how many pieces we'll need to produce or if our shops will have an opening for our project when we are ready for production. Additionally, the manufacturing world is in considerable flux at the moment. Though our preferred shop is excited about working on our project and a revery capable at what they do, we can\u2019t be 100% certain they will be able to complete the work when the time comes.\n\nFor those of you who are new to our projects, we have a lot of product development, manufacturing & crowdfunding delivery experience.

For many this product was intended as a gift for the holiday season, and it is entirely within reason for you to have expected it to arrive at that time. Under normal circumstances it is a challenge enough coordinating manufacturers, suppliers, and the like to meet a deadline - moreso when your business consists of one person managing it all.

My dad had every intent to deliver this before the holidays, and did what he could to meet that promise. Of the many factors that dragged this out so late - I assure you none of which were intentional. It has all been at the whim of circumstances, of which neither he nor I had the ability to speed up.

You don\u2019t just save money with the SwitchBot Curtain, you do your part for the environment by retaining your existing curtains instead of throwing it away.\n\nWe support 99% curtains\nSome smart curtain solutions only support a single type of curtains. Others are too bulky or require tedious modifications to provide a power source.\nThe SwitchBot Curtain supports different track types such as U-rail and I-rail, and also rod types. It is also wireless. Just clip it on and you're ready to go. It is that simple. \nWe even handle that \"BUMP\" for extendable rods and rails\n Rods, retrofitted\nThe round rails allow the SwitchBot Curtain to glide smoothly along the rod. Just clip on the rails and you're all set.\nFor those of you who have a longer rod with a bump where the rod extends, we've got that figured out. The SwitchBot Curtain is not affected by such bumps.\nInstall in seconds\n U Rails, retrofitted\nThe SwitchBot Curtain has hooks for U-rail. It is simple to attach the respective hooks to the rails.  \nInstall in seconds\n I Rails, retrofitted\nThe SwitchBot Curtain has hooks for I-rail. It is simple to attach the respective hooks to the rails. \nInstall in seconds\nOpen and close the curtain at your fingertip. We offer intuitive App control for iOS and Android, with weekly/bi-weekly updates following feedback from you. OTA firmware update is also available for better user experience.\nIntuitive UI\nSmart living is powered by your voice commands. Wouldn't it be great to just say it?\n\"Alexa/Ok Google/Hey Siri, close my curtain please\" (Hub is required)\nEven with SwitchBot Curtain, you'd probably still instinctively draw the curtains by hand some times. When it senses you drawing the curtain, the SwitchBot Curtain will kick in and do the work for you. We call this Touch & Go.\nSwitchBot Curtain makes even the conventional way to draw a curtain smarter.\n\nA wireless remote button add-on for you to place anywhere. \nHold it or mount it. Your say.\nDouble-sided curtains are very common and we have been getting a lot of enquiries about how to use the SwitchBot Curtain with these. You could get two units and part the double-sided curtains from the middle. Or, you could try out this tip from the King of Retrofit! Attach the top curtains with a velcro strip or a strong clip so the curtains will move as one. Then install the SwitchBot Curtain on either ends to let it work its magic!\nSo your next question is probably where to find a velcro strip. Good news is, we believe so strongly in retrofitting that we will ship every SwitchBot Curtain with a velcro strip in the box as a standard accessory.\nThe SwitchBot Curtain is so small that it hides nicely behind your curtains. It will work in its own way without getting in your way.  Likewise, we keep the sophisticated mechanism within the body of the SwitchBot Curtain, giving you fast and easy installation so you can enjoy the benefits it brings.   \nSize fits in your palm.\nInstead of a wired system, the SwitchBot Curtain is a wireless solution. It uses a rechargeable battery that lasts 8 months depending on the usage. This means you only need to charge it once or twice a year! \nWhat's more, you can forget about having to charge it by getting the solar power strip add-on. Sunlight will ensure the SwitchBot Curtain is charged up for its daily work routine.\nOur SwitchBot Curtain is very complicated from the inside so it is so SIMPLE for you on the outside.\nOur SwitchBot Curtain is very complicated from the inside so it is so SIMPLE for you on the outside.\nIn the box, 2 types of hooks will be there for your preference.\nSwitchBot Hub Mini\nHub for SwitchBot Curtain and a universal Infrared remote control (Recommended)\nWhy we need your support\nWe have finished the development of the SwitchBot Curtain and we are excited to get it into the market to you. However, we cannot bring this product to life without your support. We need to raise funds for the raw materials and components needed to start mass production of the SwitchBot Curtain.\nFind us on GitHub: https://github.com/OpenWonderLabs/\nA few years ago, we shared the possibility to control SwitchBot on their Raspberry Pi, OpenWRT board, or PC running Linux based system. It has been a fantastic journey since then with contributions by many users who love to DIY! \nMakers who don't want to use Bluetooth controls can now choose to use our RESTFUL APIs. Moreover, you can use Home Assistant!\nTap on the power of IFTTT + Webhook to create and trigger countless incredibly creative scenarios! \nBoost your creativity! \nDoes the SwitchBot Curtain inspire you to use it in other ways? Yes, we thought it would. That's why we are sharing the STL files to build your hooks after the campaign!\nBesides adapting the SwitchBot Curtain to work with any rods and rails, you can also use create hooks to extend the SwitchBot Curtain's function! We came up with wacky ideas such as using it to open and close the door,  and building a cam cable to mounting a small action camera or the OSMO Pocket. We are excited to see what creative ideas can you come up with!\nBe creative with your cat.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nIt took us 2 years to have everything ready. We don't want a bad product for you.\nDevelopment and testing \nThe SwitchBot Curtain is not possible before we develop, craft, and test tirelessly in the past 2 years. We tried and tested thousands of rods and rails, and found every possible way to stress test it. \nWe listen. We fix. We iterate.\nValidated thousands of rods and rails\nThe roller coaster test\nSwitchBot Curtain is strong!\n2017 to now\nChoose one of the add-ons for each add-on pledge\nPress kit is available here. \nThe words\nThank you SwitchBot community!\nSwitchBot has grown since our last successful campaign.

One night after reading before sleeping, he realized that he cannot even turn off his bedroom light and close his curtain on the bed. This led to the team evaluating all kinds of self-proclaimed smart switches and curtains in the market. Our first thought was to have a robot butler. Yet, the reality is that despite years of robots making the news, we have not seen a real robot that in our homes. Thus, we began our adventure to create a useful, simple and convenient bot. SwitchBot is the fruit of our labor.

All were filmed at E3, along Venice Beach, and Hollywood Boulevard in June 2019. \nForget just hearing sound. We\u2019re enabling you to feel sound. Woojer is a progressive sensation that boasts an amplified level of immersion. Imagine standing right next to a huge bass cabinet. You know that oomph you feel in your body? That energy pulsing into your bones? That\u2019s what Woojer feels like.  It gives you everything that your headphones simply can\u2019t.  \n\n\n\nSound is air movement that typically spreads as an audible wave of pressure. Headphones gather that audible part, but you\u2019re missing out on the movement. That\u2019s where Woojer steps in. We enable you to enjoy both aspects of sound. \nSimply put on the strap or vest, connect the audio and start feeling the sound. \nAfter all the feedback we received from 70K+ users, we decided to create a new series that everyone can dig.

Getting touch right in the design of objects and products is essential \u2013 this is where the Trill sensors come in.\nThe Trill sensors use capacitive sensing to precisely track finger movements, making it quick and easy to create beautifully responsive new touch interfaces. \nTrill is brought to you by the team behind Bela, the open-source maker platform for working with audio and sensors. With this Kickstarter we want to bring rapid touch prototyping to makers, product designers, interactive artists, instrument builders and synth experimenters around the world.\n\nWe are launching t\u0336h\u0336r\u0336e\u0336e\u0336 five types of sensor (see our Stretch Goals below): \n TRILL BAR, a slider that can sense up to five touch points \n TRILL SQUARE, a touch pad that senses two axes of movement\n TRILL CRAFT,  a 30-channel breakout board that lets you make your own touch interfaces out of anything conductive\nSee the stretch goals section below for TRILL HEX and TRILL RING.\nTrill connects to lots of things\nWorking with Trill is easy. Trill sensors use an I2C connection which means they can be connected to a variety of popular maker boards.  We include a library and examples for Bela, Arduino and Raspberry Pi that give you everything you need to get started. \n\nCreate sophisticated interfaces\nEach sensor has a configurable I2C address that can be set via solder bridges on the back so you can connect multiple Trill sensors together and create complex touch interfaces. Sensing through thin surfaces like vinyl is also possible, allowing you to embed and hide the sensors within your custom interface.\n\nCut sensors to size\nYou can also cut the sensors down to size if you have a specific application that requires a different shape sensor. \n\nTurn anything into a sensor\nTRILL CRAFT allows you to turn anything that conducts electricity into a sensor: you can make sliders or buttons out of copper tape, conductive paint, e-textiles and many other materials such as water, metals and even fruit.\n\nTrill sensors can be used to create all kinds of wonderful interactive devices and interfaces. Over the course of the Kickstarter campaign we will be releasing detailed posts and tutorials that explain how each of these projects were built \u2013 stay tuned!\n\n Sonic Circuit Sculpture by Helen Leigh \nHelen Leigh has created a family of sonic circuit sculptures that use Trill Craft in combination with Bela Mini to create a beautiful series of interactive sound installations. Read more about this project on our blog: https://blog.bela.io/2019/09/19/trill-helen-leigh-craft-circuit-sculpture/\n\n Euro-Trill Modular Synth\nThe Trill sensors are the perfect tools for building synthesisers and electronic musical instruments. At Bela we have created a number of instruments with these sensors already. Below is a modular synth that we created with all three types of Trill sensor and our DIY Eurorack module Pepper.  Read more about this project on our blog: https://blog.bela.io/2019/09/27/euro-trill-modular-eurorack/\n\nVisualising Trill sensors in the Bela IDE\nThe Trill sensors ship with libraries and examples for a variety of popular maker boards like Arduino and Raspberry Pi, but the perfect partner for the Trill sensors is our own maker platform, Bela. \n\nGranulator with Trill Bar and Trill Square\nBrass instrument with Trill Craft\n\nTrill sensors are designed by the team behind Bela, the open-source maker platform for ultra-low latency audio and sensors. Like Bela, the Trill sensors are open-source hardware letting you edit and remix our designs.\nBela launched on Kickstarter in 2016, and empowers makers, designers and musicians to create beautifully responsive instruments and other interactive projects. Our speciality is music: we understand the specific demands of musicians, and we design high quality products that work for them but are also perfect for many other types of product design and making.\n\nTrill sensors use capacitive sensing to track finger position responsively and with high resolution. Each sensor features a microcontroller containing high-resolution analog hardware and custom firmware.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have now (10th October) unlocked our first two stretch goals, Trill Hex and Trill Ring.\nBackers are now able to choose from five Trill sensors for their rewards: Trill Bar, Square, Craft, Hex or Ring (we'll send you a survey after the campaign to get your choices).\nTrill Hex has now been reached as a stretch goal and backers will be able to additionally choose this sensor at the end of the campaign! Trill Hex is a hexagonal, 2-axis x/y sensor. Perfect for tessellation. Trill Hex will make building complex touch interfaces like isomorphic keyboards easier than ever before.\n\n Trill Ring, a one-axis circular slider that can also detect up to 5 simultaneous touches. Perfect for controlling volume, filters and more. This stretch goal was unlocked at \u00a318k.\n\nAlready a backer? Don't worry, you don't need to choose your rewards now - we'll send you a survey when the campaign ends to get your final choices. In the meantime, you can increase your pledge at any time to take advantage of these additional options as they become available (\u00a311-\u00a314 per sensor depending on your reward, check your reward for details).\nTrill comes from the creators of Bela, the open source maker platform for audio and sensor processing, and TouchKeys, which brings expressive multi-touch sensing to the piano keyboard. Both projects were launched with successful Kickstarter campaigns.\n\nBela launched on Kickstarter in 2016 and now sells boards worldwide\nBela empowers makers, designers, artists and musicians to create beautifully responsive interactive systems\nGlobal community of makers in the thousands sharing projects on blog.bela.io \nIntuitive toolchain for creating complex interactive sound projects\n\n  TouchKeys launched on Kickstarter in 2013 \nSells finished keyboards and DIY overlays at http://touchkeys.co.uk/ \nCapacitive touch overlay for any piano keyboard     \n\n\nAll of our activities as a company are about supporting makers and giving them the best creative tools to work with. As a group we understand musicians' needs intimately and make high quality products that can meet their demanding requirements.\nKickstarter is our platform of choice for launching new products \u2013 we know it well and believe it is the ideal way to reach out to our community and the wider world of makers before bringing a product to the market.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are an experienced team that has successfully delivered on two Kickstarter campaigns (Bela Platform 2016 and TouchKeys 2013). We have a proven track record of delivering our rewards in a timely manner and are confident we can do the same with this campaign. Within our team we have extensive experience in hardware and software development as well as existing relationships with trusted manufacturers and part suppliers. \n\nThe final hardware designs of the Trill sensors have been thoroughly tested going out to numerous beta testers in the last few months who have helped to iron out any issues in the design and software support. This means that we are ready to go into production as soon as the campaign ends.\n\nAs with any hardware project, delays could occur due to disruption further up the supply chain. To mitigate this risk as much as possible we are using trusted suppliers and manufacturers that we have worked with many times before.

We don't take that for granted and we're here to create a great game for you to the best of our abilities. \nWhat follows is the original Kickstarter campaign description. Finished Kickstarter projects cannot be edited, so this information will fall out of date over time. For the latest, go to: http://bugbyte.fi/spacehaven \nEmbark on a space voyage with your ragtag crew of civilians in search of a new home. Build spaceships tile by tile, create optimal gas conditions, manage the needs and moods of their crew, encounter other space-faring groups, and explore the universe in this spaceship colony sim for Windows, Mac, Linux.\nSpace Haven combines the emergent story telling components of RimWorld with a tile-based gas-simulation system seen in Oxygen Not Included.\nSurvive your own way. Choose to act like a pirate, slave trader, alien hunter or a force for good.\nWant to be a pirate and attack and steal from anyone you meet? Maybe you want to be a slave trader and capture crew members from other factions and sell them on the market? You could be a notorious alien hunter, fighting aliens aboard derelict ships and scavenging their meat. Or perhaps you're the good guy fighting pirates and helping civilians? Space Haven aims to give you the freedom to role play.\nSpace Haven allows for complete freedom regarding building.\n Customize - Complete freedom to build a spaceship or station of your own desire. Place every piece of ship hull, wall, door and facility wherever you want. \n Functional - All facilities serve a purpose. Crew members will sleep in beds, use toilets, be disturbed by a noisy room and praise you for an arcade machine.\nA functional spaceship can be built tile-by tile, giving you the opportunity to shape a spaceship of your own desire. It can be symmetric and streamlined, or an asymmetrical whimsical looking thing. It does not have to look like a conventional spaceship depicted in sci-fi literature, you are free to design your own, the choice is yours!\nTile-based gas system simulates various gases, temperature and crew comfort on your spaceship.\n Oxygen and CO2 - Keep optimal Oxygen and CO2 levels by building life support modules for your crew members.\n Hazardous gases - Certain facilities and explosions can release hazardous gases. Build scrubbers to purify the air.\n Temperature and power - Build thermal regulators to maintain an ideal temperature for your crew. Build power nodes and set up power distribution throughout the ship.\n Comfort - Building a bed right next to the ship core will disturb sleep. Design your ship for crew comfort.\nThe isometric tile-based gas system simulates various gases, temperature and crew comfort on your spaceship. Humans, plants and facilities react to the conditions surrounding them, giving meaning to how you design your ship and the living conditions you create. Secure facilities, optimize crew survival and well-being, but also think of possible future accidents and chaos generated from crew combat or environmental hazards. \nThe game simulates needs, moods, health and relationships of crew members.\n Skills and traits - Every crew member has their own set of skills and traits. A wimp might get scared shooting a gun, while an iron-stomach can eat anything unaffected.\n Mood - A happy crew member needs food, sleep, comfort, safety and friends. Take something away and their mood will be affected. \n Conditions - Crew members might feel adventurous, suffer from starvation, feel unhygienic, or they simply ate too much. Various conditions affect how they feel. \n Mental breaks - When the stress is too much for a crew member they may suffer a mental break. Some will vent themselves out of the air lock, while others might start a fight.\nIn Space Haven characters aren't mere robots. The game simulates needs, moods, health and skills of your crew members and they develop relationships with each other. Their past life occupation and hobbies will affect their skills and know-how, and they have both positive and negative traits. Witness joyful moments, depression, and drama surrounding different crew members as you journey onward seeking a new home. \nOrganize away teams to explore derelict ships and visit other faction ships.\n Away missions - Equip your crew members and organize away teams to explore derelict ships or visit stations or spaceships of other factions. \n Draft - Draft and move your crew members to attack enemies and save their friends.\n Inventory - Each crew member has their own unique inventory. Equip them with pistols, rifles, grenades and more.\nEquip your crew with space suits and weapons and organize away teams to explore derelict ships and stations. Explore and salvage resources and items; find activated cryopods with someone frozen inside. Visit spaceships or stations of other factions and find data logs telling stories of past spacefarers searching for a new home. \nAliens try to capture your crew members alive.\n Crew combat - Engage in combat with enemy factions or an alien species. \n Aliens - Watch aliens incapacitate your crew members and capture them alive. See them suffer in the alien lair and decide if you want to try to save them or not.\nAliens capture your crew members and cocoon them against walls in their base. See them suffer in the alien lair and decide if you want to save them or not. Explore derelict ships and discover someone from the original crew of the ship captured by the aliens. Events like these create interesting back stories to new arrivals to your crew.\nEngage in ship-to-ship combat, where a hit can snowball into a disastrous event for your crew.\n Battlestations - Watch your crew take battlestations as you engage the enemy in ship-to-ship battle. See your crew load turrets with projectiles, put out fires from explosions, patch hull breaches and repair vital facilities in the midst of battle.\n Tactical - Target the enemy ship engine and stop them from fleeing. See them do the same to you. Engage their turrets directly or try to focus on the enemy ship core and see their ship go pitch black. Build shields to protect your most vital segments of your ships.\nBuild turrets and engage in tactical ship-to-ship combat, where a hit and explosion could cause a snowball effect of fire, smoke, hazardous gases and even hull breaches for either party. All crew members need to work together to win the battle.\nTreat crew member for injuries, diseases and other medical conditions.\n Cryopods - Protect your crew from side-effects of Inter-stellar travel. Place crew members into stasis to freeze the progression of a disease or to await rescue. \n Medical - Treat crew members for injuries, wounds and diseases. Medical conditions affect crew members in various ways.\nYour crew members will become wounded in battles and might catch a serious disease. Set up a medical room, scan for diseases and foreign masses and have your best doctor tend to illnesses and perform surgeries. Hope that your doctor is not absent minded and leaves a surgical tool inside.\nExplore a new procedurally generated galaxy each playthrough.\n Generated galaxy - Explore a new procedurally generated galaxy each playthrough, with planets, asteroids, stations and spaceships of other factions.\n Factions - Interact with various factions all trying to survive and establish dominance their own way. Meet pirates, merchants, slave traders, cultists and more and develop relationships with each. \n Resources - Mine for raw resources and refine them to building materials. Trade resources with other groups you meet.\nExplore a new procedurally generated galaxy each new playthrough, with various factions all trying to survive and establish dominance their own way. You'll meet pirates, slavers, merchants, cults, androids and more. Jump into hyperspace, seek out resources and meet various groups and develop your relationship with them.\n  Type: Single player\n  Genre: Indie, Simulation, Strategy\n  Platform: Windows, Mac, Linux\n  Release dates: Kickstarter Alpha (April 2019), Steam Early Access (Q4 2019), Full Launch (2020)\nWe're taking this seriously. We're not going to put the game on Steam, even as early access, before we have iteratively developed the game to be ready for that. You, our Kickstarter backers, will help us get the game to that point by providing us invaluable feedback as we progress. \nJoin the alpha crew and help us create something beautiful! You will get access to the game once this campaign has ended and Kickstarter has sent us the backer data. \nWe've worked hard for three years to create the architecture of the game, giving us a solid base to build upon. Now it's time to start adding much needed content. As a Kickstarter backer, you'll be able to give us feedback regarding which direction we take the game. Below are a few of our thoughts.\nNote that this list of modules isn't a roadmap and may not all ever be finished. We will do our best to implement as much as possible.\n Role play elements - Expand on game elements allowing you to role play, giving you the ability to butcher aliens for meat, sell your crew members for credits and attack and steal from anyone you see. Role play as a pirate, slave trader, alien hunter, merchant or other.\n Faction relations - Create more depth to factions, their back stories and how they relate to each other.\n Environmental storytelling - Create an environmental story generation tool. Explore ships and stations and find Androids, who overpowered their masters, medical bays filled with corpses, open alien eggs on a research bench with dead crew members around.\n Deep characterization - Improve character interactions, relationships, conditions, traits and diseases to give more depth to your crew members.\n Research - Create a research tree, with new technology to unlock. Research new weapons, shields and facilities.\n Health modeling - Medical beds would have a scanning mechanism. Scan for diseases and foreign masses. Have your doctor perform surgeries and tend to the sick.\n Crew combat - Improve on the mechanics of crew combat.\n Ship-to-ship battle - Implement and improve on the mechanics of ship-to-ship battle.\n Game customization - New game modes, like a sandbox mode or building space stations instead of spaceships. If something annoys you turn it off. Customize your game regarding game difficulty, faction presence and so on.\n Multiple endings - Create more than one way to finish a playthrough, tied to stories. Endless sandbox possibility.\n Modding - Mod support can allow the player base to implement interesting, or experimental ideas of their own, allowing for a richer gaming experience. \n Landing on Planets - This would be a big task, and would require a lot of time. It is something we dream of though. With enough funding we could give it a serious thought.\n Your wishes -  Anything the community thinks up is on the table. We will listen and implement to our best judgement.\nWhile playing, you'll be listening to amazing emotional tracks developed  by Paul Zimmermann. We are very happy to work with someone who can create exactly what we needed to realize our vision for Space Haven's sound. Paul is developing both the music and the sound effects for Space Haven.

We were already practicing it in India, during the Vedic period, 2 thousand years before Jesus Christ. Etruscan and roman citizens, Arabic countries and Spanish people loved to play with faith with those six faces. One of them was a flower drawn (\u01cez-z\u01cehr, in ancient Arab) and, in latin, dice, the dice\u2019s game, and hazard, were designated with the word \u00ab Alea \u00bb. As old as the world, the dice game has not much evolved since. But it was used for a lot of goals. We use it \u201cnaked\u201d for poker, or 421, or for an accessory in games like goose game, parcheesi, or backgammon, or even Monopoly, for making the pawns move forward.", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac5 or more", "title": "Show your love", "descp": "Thanks for supporting our project !

That wasn\u2019t the case, we struggled to improve it in a better way, but : \n                - It took really more time than expected and many iterations;\n                - Thus it costed us more than expected before (I remind you that we did not pay ourselves but just our subcontractors).\n                - We also improved the apps and games concepts. And to not burn more and more money that we would need to produce, we went forward by developing firstly with internships (slower and cheaper\u2026).\n                - We also improved the docking station and the dice itself (you can see the minor costs for that).\n\n3) Considering the treasury, we started to reach out business angels, public subsidies, etc. which ones were interested by investing in Dicees. But unfortunately, the crisis brought negotiations to a halt. We are softly restarting to talk to potential investors.\nBy the way, some of you are talking about the project value estimation for a potential investor, I\u2019m not sure that you take all the time, the investment, the market potential, the IP, and so on into account to pretend that nobody would invest that much money in Dicees.

Robots are NOW and you can make them. Robot vacuums, companion robots & UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles)/ autonomous drones have grown in popularity and will soon become an integral part of your life. Be a part of building the future by joining the Maker Community! \nFor autonomous robots, a core technology is LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging Sensor). Ever wonder how a robot can see? How does a robot vacuum avoid walls? How does a self-driving car sense traffic or pedestrians? The answer is LiDAR, a scanning technology that maps objects or space by illuminating the target with a pulsed laser light. \niLidar is the first solid-state LiDAR sensor made for ALL MAKERS from beginner to robotics developers. Overcoming the limitations of traditional LiDAR, iLidar offers cutting-edge LiDAR performance at an unbeatable price, all in one compact sensor module.\nAs Seen On\nInteresting Engineering | Geeky Gadgets | hackster | engineering.com | Connetcted Crib | Brainiacs from Mars | Robotis Gizmos | Trend Hunter | World IT Show | Maker Faire Seoul 2018\n1D LiDAR \nUtilizing a point laser, 1D LiDAR sensors are only capable of measuring distance to one point. While cheap and compact, their use functionality is limited.\n2D LiDAR\n2D LiDAR allows for basic scanning of space. To scan in 2D, most LiDAR sensors require rotation to sense distance on a line across space. \niLidar \nUtilizing line laser technology, iLidar is capable of 2D mapping without requiring rotation. To scan a space in true 3D, iLidar simply needs to scan on the vertical axis. \nIn the video below, you can view iLidar\u2019s performance. Through innovation in short-range LiDAR performance, iLidar provides unparalleled performance cost.\n For more detail information, please download iLidar datasheet.\n iLidar Configurator \nDon't bothered by initial sensor configuration work on your embedded platforms. Plug iLidar into your PC and configure it as you want. Configuration data can be saved into iLidar's non-volatile memory section, and will be loaded at each power-up afterward. Real-time data visualization is also possible with iLidar Configurator. See what iLidar sees.\nOpen Software Development Kit : C/C++  \nHave complete access to iLidar\u2019s open source SDK (software development kit). Plug & play by configuring iLidar with a variety of embedded micro controllers including Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or Jetson.\nThe Hybo team was formed as the robotics club at Pohang University of Science & Technology(POSTECH). As makers ourselves, one of the biggest frustrations was the inaccessibility of a quality, affordable LiDAR sensor. Finally, we decided why not make one ourselves?\niLidar was created for makers by makers. Affordable, versatile and compact, iLidar makes LiDAR technology accessible to everyone. We continue to be heavily involved in the maker community including participating in the Maker Fair and cannot wait to hear about how you integrate iLidar into your creations!\nWhy are we on Kickstarter?\nAll funds raised on Kickstarter will go towards: \n1. Mass production costs for iLidar\n2. Development of SDK & iLidar Visualizer software\n3.

But let\u2019s be honest \u2013 there are no good water guns around anymore. Squirting pathetic water streams after minutes of pumping? That's not what water guns should be like in 2018.  \nWe think that the water gun has the potential to become so much more. This is why two years ago, we set out on a mission: to completely reinvent the water gun \u2013 and take water fights to the next level.  \nThe water gun revolution is already on the way\n You would like to write or post about Spyra One too? Find our press and media kit here!\nSimply pull the trigger and feel the powerful shots. Each water bullet is exactly 30 ml \u2013 about the size of a shot glass. There's no need for paint or target vests to find out who hit whom: the water bullets leave clear water marks on your friends' shirts. Let them fade after a few minutes in the sun and get ready for a rematch! \nCombining range with precision for the first time. If you're older than five, water fighting is as much about pure range as driving is about just getting there. So Spyra One not only matches the range of the top water guns on the market. Its patent-pending valve-nozzle technology also achieves a previously unknown precision: Instead of soaking, Spyra One's water bullets clearly hit their targets at up to 7.5 meters \u2013 that's as far as the laws of physics allow! \nNo protection needed \u2013 it's just water. Because of our specifically engineered valve-nozzle technology, Spyra One requires only low pressure levels to achieve maximum precision and range. You don't need any protective gear to start a fight wherever there's water around.  \nRefilling becomes part of the game. With the push of a button, Spyra One refills the entire tank with water \u2013 25 shots in 14 seconds. Gone are the times where the break to run into the house and refill your tank was the killer of every water battle. With Spyra One, counting your water bullets and refilling strategically becomes part of the fight. \nRefill anywhere, from any water source. Spyra One's pumping system is protected by a water filter, so you don't have to worry about small parts damaging the internals. Just hold the front end of Spyra One into any clean water source \u2013 a lake, a bucket, or your swimming pool \u2013 and push the button to let Spyra One refill the tank.  \nFull control down to the last water bullet. Stop guessing how much water you have left to launch that final attack. With Spyra One's digital display, you just know \u2013 down to the exact number of water bullets left in your tank. When you shoot, it counts down, and when you refill, it counts up again. This way, you never risk running dry in the worst moment.\nAlways know Spyra One's battery status. Spyra One's digital display also tells you when it's time to take a break from water fighting and recharge its integrated batteries. Don't worry: You will probably tire from water battles earlier than Spyra One does. The battery easily lasts for a full day of water fights with at least 45 refill cycles and 1125 shots.  \nFull pressure whenever you need it. Spyra One's integrated pump repressurizes the water automatically during refilling. The tank system then holds the pressure constant from the first to the last shot. Whether you have 25 shots left or just one, you always have full range and precision. All without any extra supplies like CO2 cartridges. And the best thing: There is no need for pumping anymore! \nNo more pumping. Ever. Did we mention this already? It's like magic. While your water fight opponents are still busy working out their biceps to build up pressure, you are 100% back in the game whenever you choose to. You can even interrupt the auto-refill process at any time, ward off attackers, and continue refilling.  \nPLAY\n\nHero Pack: Be the water gun revolutionary this world needs. This is your chance: Choose your own Spyra One and make water fights great again! \nBattle Packs: Pick your favorite friend (or opponent) and get the fight on. Prove your bravery in the eye of cold water with a Fighter Pack of Spyra Ones in your team colors!\nEscalation Packs: Planning a mutiny at that other department at work or a 'different' surprise for your best friends\u2019 wedding? We can\u2019t think of better use cases for these packs. Gather your two football teams and get ready for total escalation!\nColors and shipping\nColors (red/blue): We send out a survey for the colors after the campaign ends - you can pick any combination of colors you like. Example: For an Epic Battle Pack (8x Spyra One), you can choose 6 red Spyra Ones and 2 blue Spyra Ones in the survey.\nShipping: To find out the shipping cost for your country, choose your reward and select your country. Larger packs are more efficient \u2013 so it really pays to find a friend to back Spyra One with you! Through a special service provider deal, we managed to get local rates for both US and central Europe! Yay!\nYou, the community, already pushed this campaign farther than we ever thought possible. We have asked ourselves: maybe we can do even more together? And yes, we think we can! We asked you what your wished were, and carefully deliberated what is possible.  \nWith your help, we decided. If we reach those funding levels together, we commit to deliver the following:\nPOWER SHOT [UNLOCKED!]: The option to release an extra-powerful water bullet after holding down the trigger for a few seconds.\nEXCLUSIVE COLOR: Your Spyra One becomes available in Kickstarter Green. Exclusive for backers, and never available again!\nLOCKED: Stretch goal reached at: \u20ac666,666 (about $775,000)\nSHOULDER STRAP: A modified design that allows to attach a shoulder strap for more comfort in extended water fights and transporting Spyra One.\nLOCKED: Stretch goal reached at: \u20ac888,888 (about $1,025,000)\n\nWhatever happens on the way \u2013 we will keep you informed. Building a hardware product is hard and we may face unforeseen events that are going to delay us. As we have done in the past on our Facebook page and our email list, you can count on one thing: we will always keep you updated on our status and potential delays at least one update per month on Kickstarter.  \nSebastian Walter, Founder of Spyra\nHaving grown up with the 1990s' iconic water guns, Sebastian was shocked to not find any decent models anymore when he was preparing for a rubber boat party in 2015. Disappointed about the state of the industry, he started working on his own vision of a great water gun on nights and weekends.  \nWhen the first prototype was built a few months later, Sebastian decided to put everything on one card. He quit his job as a product designer at a German car manufacturer and set out to build the best water gun in the world. \nIn total, it took more than two years and six generations of prototypes to arrive at a pre-series, feature-complete design prototype of Spyra One. The next step is clear: series production of the Spyra One \u2013 with your help. \nThe modern water gun was invented by NASA engineer Lonnie Johnson in 1990. After two years of developing the Spyra One, we know why: Making water bullets fly through air is, literally, rocket science. Small amounts of accelerated water shot through air are subject to water turbulence and air resistance. The result: spraying.  \nTo achieve Spyra One's range and precision, it was necessary to optimize the valve-nozzle system for laminar flow. This was Dominik's job: the Air and Space Engineer tested countless nozzle shapes, over and over again, in our own 9-meter-long test channel.\nRocket Scientist Dominik implementing a new test setup\nTurning of differently shaped water gun nozzles\nSetup of the nozzle at the test channel\nTesting a nozzle in Spyra's shooting channel\nMeasuring range and spread of the water bullet after 8 meters\nBuilding a water gun in 2018, we can make use of electronics that would have cost a fortune back in the 1990s. The possibilities opened up by modern electronics and software engineering enabled us to implement central features like the integrated pump, the digital display counting your water bullets and a highly efficient electronic trigger-valve system. All of those drastically improve performance and take up less space than their mechanical equivalents. \nArduino-controlled first garage-built prototype\nSoldering the circuit board for a 2018 prototype\nTo maximize the fun you can have with a water fight, range was important but not by far our only focus. We asked around and found that the biggest pain points in previous water guns were #1, cumbersome screwing and refilling and #2, endless, biceps-wracking pumping to build up pressure.\nAn integrated, electronic pump that auto-refills and auto-pressurizes was therefore a must-have for the Spyra One. We tested for pumping speed, sound emissions, and battery efficiency, and ended up with a great pumping system. Watch how Sebastian demonstrates the convenience achieved by Spyra One's pump-tank system in our final prototype: Auto-refill and constant pressure, with no pumping at all. \nPLAY\n\nSince Spyra One is electronically controlled anyways, it was only logical to use that to your advantage with a status display. Now your water gun always tells you exactly how many shots are left in the tank. It's great for strategic gameplay \u2013 and honestly, it's just pretty cool.\nAn early prototype of the digital display\nTesting the display in the final prototype during refill\nWe did not test in the lab alone. You \u2013 the community \u2013 were with us from the start: as roommates who indulged our endless messing with water in the apartment ...\nPLAY\n\n ... Or as testers who subjected the prototypes of our patent-pending technology during trial water fights in our own arena. Watch this fun video we shot for our social media channels where Spyra One competes against two regular water guns in the test arena outside our headquarters:\nPLAY\n\n10 people for building a water gun? When we started building the Spyra One in 2015, we would have never guessed that three years later, the project would evolve into a company that would occupy 10 team members in engineering, marketing and business.  \nWe are here for you! Reach out to us here on Kickstarter, our Facebook page or our YouTube channel. Because shooting us a message is still as easy as hitting our friends with a Spyra One. You have a question? Send it to us: hello@spyraone.com.\nWith our funded campaign, we have a lot of work to do and that means:\nEngineering, production, marketing or sales: we are looking for talented and skilled people. Just shoot us an email at jobs@spyraone.com and tell us:\nWhy you are excited about the Spyra One\nWhat topic or field you are interested in\nWhy you would be the perfect fit for our company\nFor students: From when until when you would like to do your thesis/internship project.\nSince June 2018, we are ready to start the water gun revolution! We have fully functional prototypes that we have shown you here on Kickstarter. We have discussed and confirmed the remaining development steps until series production with our suppliers and partners. If all goes as planned, we will be able to complete production in schedule and ship Spyra One to you next summer. \nWe have done our part \u2013 now we need you! Kicking off a big production entails high set-up costs. As an independent startup company, we can only get it done with your help. That is why you are so important to us: Only if enough supporters back our project by pre-ordering a Spyra One, we will have enough funding to produce, assemble and ship the Spyra One.

Controlled via an intuitive app, web account or voice-enabled devices such as Amazon Alexa, Canvia makes it easy to find art to suit changing tastes, keep you inspired and enliven your surroundings.\nWhy Did We Create Canvia?\nJust as Spotify has revolutionized the accessibility, exploration and experience of recorded music, and services like Netflix have done the same for vast archives of film and TV, we want Canvia to revolutionize the accessibility and experience of art. \nIn order to achieve this though, we realized it wasn't only a question of content - we also needed to create a device and platform that:    \nlooks and feels like authentic physical art (i.e. a painting or print), conserving realistic details such as color, texture and brushstrokes\naugments the experience of art with key information and helpful guidance, avoiding any of the intimidating bars to entry of the art world, auctions and gallery system\nand is connected, interactive, sharable as an experience and - most importantly - flexible for people's changing needs and spaces.\nIn this way, Canvia solves problems with the 'traditional' approach to sourcing and buying art:\nHow Does Canvia Work? \nPLAY\n\nCanvia is driven by Palacio\u2019s proprietary (patent-pending) ArtSense technology that simulates the behavior of a physical painting or high quality print on a digital screen, whatever the environment.\nBuilt-in sensors read ambient visual conditions and this data is used to actively adapt the displayed image. The light-emitting screen therefore appears solely light-reflective, as with physical art, and ensures all images retain a realistic painting or print-like quality (conserving details like texture, color and individual brushstrokes) under any conditions.\nArtSense technology simulates the behavior of a physical painting or high quality print on a digital screen, conserving details such as texture, colors and even individual brushstrokes\nArtSense also enables art selections that better suit an environment and context. In this way, Canvia offers a more realistic and harmonious art viewing experience than any computer monitor or TV; so real, in fact, that it\u2019s difficult to tell the difference between Canvia and physical art. \nDon\u2019t Just Take Our Word For It\u2026\nPLAY\n\nWith Canvia, seeing is believing. If you want to check it out for yourself, request a timeslot for a live demo or video stream at outreach@palacio.life.  \nYou can also find out more on our website, Twitter and Instagram.\nStretch Goals\nThe Art Library\nCanvia is linked to a huge online library that includes artworks from all genres, eras, cultures and media (including photography), offering choices to suit any mood, occasion, context and d\u00e9cor.\nNeed something relaxing for a late-night study session? You can schedule one of Monet's calming waterlily paintings. Friends over for the big game? Go for a George Bellows from one of our 'Sports' themed playlists. Throwing a house party? We've got an explosive Kandinsky or energetic Degas cabaret scene for that.  \nWe\u2019ll be offering two subscription tiers for Canvia: a \u2018free\u2019 tier that currently has over 3,000 works (and is growing everyday), from Old Masters to Modern and Contemporary art, and a paid-for \u2018premium\u2019 tier of famous and upcoming current artists, illustrators and photographers.\nAll artwork is carefully curated and organized into themed playlists (for both vertical and horizontal orientations), or users can create their own. \nOur recommendation engine also helps you find works matching your d\u00e9cor and preferences, and all playlists can be scheduled for specific times of day.\nArtist Engagement \nCanvia is about sharing great art. We\u2019re building up a network of contributing partners - individual artists and photographers, galleries, museums and colleges - to ensure we offer the best art in the world. \nSince starting our outreach activities in March, we've partnered with over one hundred professional artists from across the globe and the list is growing every day. We recognize the great effort of creating art and so contributing artists will receive a share of our revenues.\nIf you're an artist and would like to apply to our library, please contact outreach@palacio.life.\nDevice Features & Specs\nUsers can schedule their own playlists and upload personal images via the app (iOS or Android), web account, USB or MicroSD. Information about an artwork and artist can be added as an overlay, and the entire artwork can be explored through zoom and repositioning functionality within the app.\nVoice integration with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant will be supported, although may not be available with the first firmware/software launch.\nAll works submitted by artists will reside in a closed system, which includes Canvia's secure cloud library, device and app. This will ensure the digital reproductions of artists' work cannot be misappropriated.\nCanvia\u2019s innovative patent-pending design allows customers to select variable frame/mat board widths, wood type and color, offering even more options to match your d\u00e9cor and creative preferences.  \nBlack, cherry, wood and white frame colors will be available for launch; black as standard and the other colors for an additional cost of $25. In order to upgrade your pledges, please follow these instructions:\nNote that the final mass-produced frame might have slightly different dimensions from the current pre-production prototypes due to manufacturing constraints. We will inform backers of any changes.\nHinges at the back allow you to pivot the device and access communication ports for USB and MicroSD uploads while Canvia is still mounted to the wall.\nCanvia automatically detects the orientation and loads compatible playlists.\nVESA mount compatibility affords greater mobility and control.\nWe also have a load of additional features that will be revealed in due course, all geared towards further enhancing the art experience - watch this space!\nThe Team  \nThe team at Palacio brings deep industry experience across connected devices, IOT, cloud technologies and video & image processing, as well as art curation, art direction, advertising and media production.  \nThis confluence of technology and creative thinking drives our innovation and reflects our ultimate goal with Canvia: to combine cutting-edge technical design with an artistic sensibility to create an entirely new way of enhancing and experiencing art in our living spaces.\nWhy we need your help\nWe\u2019ve spent the last year and a half developing, user testing and improving Canvia. We come to Kickstarter with a near 100% pre-production prototype.\n\nWe're now looking for your help to revolutionize the art experience. We can't wait to bring Canvia into homes, offices, restaurants and other living spaces and open up art to the world. \n\nSpecifically, our Kickstarter campaign will help to fund: \nCompleting mold designs for the mat board and chassis \nCompleting an initial mass production and manufacturing run of our first Canvia model\nRegulatory (FCC and CE) certification\nPackaging \nFeedback!

Love solving mysteries? Installing a security camera might seem like an obvious answer for surveillance, but it may surprise you that only 3 out of 10 homes have any sort of security device set up. And, as basic as a security camera system might seem, you\u2019ll be surprised to know that other cameras on the market actually present more problems than solutions.\n eufyCam is designed from the ground up to offer wireless freedom. We eliminated power cables, wall outlets, and the need to drill holes, giving you freedom to install eufyCam practically anywhere. Stick the mount onto any flat surface and eufyCam\u2019s ready to go\u2014in less than a second; or just stick it directly onto most metallic surfaces.\nPlace eufyCam anywhere you want surveillance.\n In developing eufyCam, we made it our priority to offer the longest battery life in the industry to ensure a convenient and top-notch wire-free experience. So it only made sense that we partnered up with Anker\u2014the leader in charging technology\u2014to maximize the efficiency and charging speed of the battery.\nThis collaboration resulted in eufyCam having the power to run for 365 days (or 3 years in Standby Mode) per charge when actively monitoring areas such as your front door or driveway, not idling by in your attic.\nBirds, dogs, and falling leaves can trigger other security cameras into sending you false alarms. We understand that a security camera that sends you excessive false alarms will just be ignored, or even worse, unplugged.\neufyCam reduces false alarms by up to 95% by applying a 3-step scanning and filtering process. First, register your friends and family as trusted faces, then, once someone approaches the vicinity of your house, eufyCam can determine if that person is someone you trust to further reduce the alerts you get.\nAfter this triple-filtering process, eufyCam will send you a notification according to your security level preference, whether it\u2019s alerting you of all movements detected or only when a stranger\u2019s face shows up.\nAll this data processing happens in a flash, so you will be notified in seconds when a stranger is at your door.\n The 140\u00b0 wide-angle lens provides a panoramic view, spanning from your driveway to the front door\u2014with no spots missed\u2014making it ideal for catching people walking past or towards your home.\nTop-of-the-line Sony Exmor sensor combine with large f2.2 aperture to offer around-the-clock Full HD surveillance, recording sharp and bright video during the day, plus crisp and clear Night Vision footage in the evening.\nBased on 2-camera set and 30 days history review package for a year.\nDesigned to protect your home as well as your wallet, eufyCam is a one-time purchase that combines security with convenience. Paying for cloud storage should be an option, not a voluntary-but-mandatory cost to claim your security footage.\nBecause eufyCam records video to local storage, you\u2019ll have easy access to your footage from your smartphone. For Free. Just insert the included microSD card* and you\u2019re all set. Alternatively, by subscribing to our cloud storage plan, you can expand your security options to include simultaneous recording to the cloud.\n*Included 16GB microSD card, which you can expand anytime you want, records approximately 1 year of video on one camera, with 10 videos per day, 30 seconds each. \n*Cloud Storage optional for $2.99/month per camera.\nYour data is for your eyes only. That's why it's secured with AES 128-bit encryption. Access to your footage requires the microSD card to be inserted into the Base Station it\u2019s registered to, and you are logged on to the account tied to the Base Station. So that means you and only you can access the data. Not a thief, not your neighbor, nor anyone from the eufy Security team.  \nConstructed from cutting-edge ASA composite material, which offers unrivaled strength and protection against the elements, eufyCam works perfectly indoors and outdoors. Whether it\u2019s raining, a freezing -4\u00b0F (-20\u00b0C) winter or scorching 122\u00b0F (50\u00b0C) summer, eufyCam will keep watch over your home. \nThe built-in microphone and speaker provides you with direct communication\u2014via your smartphone\u2014to the door. Whether you\u2019re at home or out, speak directly to whoever walks up to your home.\nOpen the eufy Security app and your smartphone becomes a window for high-resolution streaming of what eufyCam sees in real-time.\nMore Capacity - by packing in more battery capacity into the camera \nBetter Power Management - by using advanced battery technology from Anker \nLess Consumption - by utilizing HybridWave technology for 70% less energy consumption  \nThe DNN (deep neural network) algorithms that eufyCam uses are inspired by the human brain, which are designed to see patterns. By recognizing patterns, the DNN algorithms categorize the sensory data eufyCam receives to filter out irrelevant patterns, so only pertinent information is analyzed. \nOnce the patterns are analyzed and determined to be human, the facial-recognition engine kicks in to scan the faces to compare to the database to determine if you need to be alerted or not.    \nThe eufyCam will ship to backers in the U.S., Canada, and 28 European Union countries including the U.K. We will continue to review shipping options for our other backers and keep you posted of any updates. \neufyCam is built with the future in mind, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ll continually develop peripheral products to work with the eufyCam system, starting first with our entry sensor. The eufy Entry Sensor can help prevent break-ins by sounding an alarm and sending you alerts when a door or window is ajar while you\u2019re sleeping, or out and about. Easily installed and monitored with the eufy Security app, the sensor can operate for 2 years with the included CR123 battery.\n To find out how to order add-ons, please read the April 19th entry on the Updates page.\n*Only reward backers can order add-ons. Add-on cameras and sensors can't work independently, need to work with eufyCam HomeBase. \n*One eufy Security HomeBase can support up to 16 eufyCams and up to 34 sensors. Every eufyCam add-on package comes with one magnetic mount and one screw mount.\nWe\u2019re planning to add support for Alexa, Google Assistant, and IFTTT in the near future, via software updates. We\u2019re making eufyCam fully Alexa-enabled, so you can control it with your voice.

Thereafter, production testing and external certification testing will be undertaken to ensure that the Mu One behaves exactly as we expect.\nThen\u2026 (drum roll) it\u2019s \u2018show time\u2019 as we start mass production of the shiny new Mu One and gear up for shipping towards the end of the summer.\nHere's a first look at our initial prototyping of the Mu One in the meantime...\nOur Story\nA few years ago two Dudes wrestled with a sketch.\nA sketch that was about to have life forced upon it.\nIt was the start of a heroic British start-up story. A story that was solving a long overlooked problem of the size of the humble UK plug.\nHaving been unchanged for over 50 years the UK plug was outdated and outsized in comparison to the mobile devices that it served. That changed as the sketch became the Mu and the UK plug size was solved forever.\nThe Mu won Design of the Year, Accessory of Mobile World Congress along with other associated high profile awards for its novel and simplistic form factor.\nBut in reality, the job was only half done.\nUnder the hood, the unseen secondary challenge of the Mu related to the power that it provides. In its first manifestation the \u2018Mu Classic\u2019, the Mu had an output power of 1Amp\u200a\u2014\u200ajust enough to charge a smartphone. Later, the \u2018Mu Tablet\u2019, \u2018Mu Duo\u2019 and \u2018Mu International\u2019 increased the power to 2.4Amp\u200a\u2014\u200anow smartphone and tablet ready. But the enemy of increasing the power of the Mu had two faces: the size of the components on the electronics board inside the Mu that were generally linear to its output, and the heat that it produced. The Mu, being super small, had a very limited enclosure to fit power and to disperse and heat. The impact that the Mu could have over a full range of mobile devices was limited by its essence\u200a\u2014\u200asize.\nFor the last two years, the small team behind the Mu have been working with the major global semi-conductor companies aligning their design to the ultimate pursuit of these goliath power providers\u200a\u2014\u200ahigh power density (lots of output in a small space) and high efficiency (low heat loss).\nAnd the results are in\u2026\nThe Mu One hosts 45W output power, now enough to power the latest notebooks and Macbooks. It hosts Power Delivery Technology that creates a variable voltage for fast charging devices, and it has an auto detect chip on board that creates an optimum charge for iOS, Android and other makes of mobile devices. All of this inside the svelte 14mm profile of the Mu.\nBeing able to add over four times the power of its predecessor is a result of the birth of Gallium Nitride Technology (GaN) enabling a huge amount of power to be enclosed in a very small space\u200a\u2014\u200aall whilst running at a market leading efficiency of over 90%.\nFinally, the solution to create the ultimate Mu is available.\nTechnology has finally caught up with the Mu that those two Dudes always wanted to produce.\nTwo Dudes\n   This project is promoted by Jellop, a direct\u00ad response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur small design team first successfully launched our UK version of the Mu in 2012.\n\nSince then we've established fantastic manufacturing partnerships allowing us to design and build a Mu family.\n\nThis will be our third big product release since launching the original Mu USB charger in 2012, and this time around we have been working with a specialist technology partner to deliver an extraordinary small and powerful product. The Mu One combines their expertise, our design skills and the superb production capabilities of our manufacturing partners.\n\nAll of these are in place and prototypes have been made so we just need to lock down those prototypes, push into production, create some tooling and stir in a little magic. \n\nSaying that, we've done this before and we know that nothing is plain sailing but we've built in some contingency time into our production schedule to allow for the inevitable 'item' that we can't foresee at the moment. We're confident that the pursuit of creating magic will overcome that unknown 'item'.

It runs on a 24-hour, light-dark cycle in sync with the sun. When you are jetlagged this is when your Circadian Rhythm is out of sync with the sun in your location.\nNapping can help you find balance when you don't get enough sleep. Even a 20-minute nap can help boost your energy and help you restore levels of tiredness.\nSleep Cycles\n         Sleep Logistics  \nOur job at Silentmode is to develop our Napinness algorithm in order to tell you when it's the best time for you to take the perfect nap. We do this using a combination of data points from sleeping hours, wake up times and desired outcomes.\n  After a period of time, your data points will help the Silentmode Napinness Algorithm customise and output your perfect napping schedule ensuring you can be at your best.\nOne of our featured audio artists Tom Middleton (SONUX) - Bioharmonic Sleep and Relaxation Soundscape Designer / Sleep Science Psychoacoustic Researcher \nThe Circadian Rhythm has an influence on the amount of REM sleep you will receive in your nap. You may have experienced a dream early in the morning rather than right after you fall asleep at night. This is the effect of the Circadian Rhythm that peaks around 9 in the morning.\nBy understanding both your rhythm and sleep patterns it's possible to customise your naps to extract beneficial physical outcomes.\n      Famous Nappers \nThere have been a great number of famous nappers over the years.

And here\u2019s what makes it even worse: When your body doesn\u2019t get the rest it needs, your stress and anxiety are not only compounded, but your body doesn\u2019t have the mental strength to fight it off.\nYou can fight back!\nNo matter what\u2019s causing your stress or anxiety, it can be improved with sleep. That\u2019s a fact. Better sleep gives you more energy, helps you focus, resets your mind, and reinvigorates your body.

On some toilets pressing extra hard on the unit to make sure it gets full surface contact is solving that concern. \nOn others where the curve is too big we have tested using thicker adhesive ads and that solves the problem. It sticks perfectly with a thicker adhesive pad we have tested.

It allows you to insert and remove the filament really easily. You won\u2019t have to try to push in/pull out filament for hours!! \nHow does it work? Tap twice on my bed and the filament will self-travel between the extruder and the nozzle. \nMy End of Filament Detection \nI cleverly detect the filament end. When I\u2019m out of filament, I pause for you to add a new spool and resume. Say goodbye to filament waste and air-printing\u2026 Yeaaaah !\nMy Beautiful and Robust Design\nDo not just focus on my beauty, I am also very strong. I have smooth curves and I am 50% 3D printed. I also have a great texture which dresses me perfectly.\nI am also very robust and I resist shocks. Made of an entirely 3D printed body weighing over 350 grams, you can tilt me, I will continue to print. \nMy amazing Print Quality\nMy print quality is amazing: I'm able to print incredibly consistent layers, from 200 microns up to 100 microns.\nOur high quality stepper motors allow the NEVA to print up to 80 mm/sec.\nAnd because I see things big, my printing surface is wide: 7 inches diameter (18 cm) and 8 inches height (20cm).\nMy simple software\nI never go out without my accessories. My free slicer (Cura by Dagoma) was conceived and imagined so that a child can use it. You only need to enter the print quality, fill rate and filament type. The rest of the settings is automatically picked and optimized for you.\nThen, insert an SD card and export your Gcode on it. That\u2019s all :)\nAnd with all these awesome skills, I can assure you, we'll have fun together !\nPLAY\n\nPerformance and integration of Hardware and software is so smooth you won\u2019t believe it : look :-)\nWait! I also come fully assembled, so just take me out of the box... plug & play!\n        Want to see a full print? Here you go!\nPLAY\n\nIt seems I'm the most fantastic and humble delta 3Dprinter. I'm the only one 50% printed... And I'm printed locally... Or I will! And I count on you to do it :) !\nI come from a big Family : the Dago'family.\nDagoma was created in 2014 in France by 2 engineers who want to change the world and our way to consume thanks to 3Dprinting.\nTo answer this strong mission, they first created my sister : the DiscoEasy200 printer. My sister is quiete famous in France : more than 8000 machines have been sold already, making Dagoma Leader in 3D printing in France and number 3 in Europe.\nAfter 2 years, my parents wanted to re-invent the simplicity and use of 3D printers. That's why they created me : the most magic, simple and affordable printer for all!\nAt the same time, they decided to open a second factory and establish it... in the US in Goleta. And this is the target of this Kickstarter: having enough backers to be able to launch this factory and deliver me to all of you quickly and in a eco-friendly way!\nI was designed to entertain young and old alike. \nYou want it? I print it. Jewelry, toys, figurines, crazy projects, spare parts for your blender or to organize your garage.\nAre you a music fan? Print your guitar. \nTell me your hobby and I will print what makes it even more wonderful.\nPLAY\n\nI was also designed for educational purposes. Whether it's to discover 3D printing and drawing or to develop fun technology projects, schools, universities and students will find a way to use me and learn with me!\nAn extraordinary wind turbine charging your phone !\nI'm not a toy, I'm a real business investment! Both small and large companies will be able to earn money thanks to me ! The first one to prove it? DAGOMA! We've got the biggest 3Dprinter factory: over 500 3D printers printing our new baby sisters almost 24/7.\nSo we want to do the same in California!\nWhat's the gain for you, entrepreneurs and Industries? Time saved on prototyping, small series... You might need me and my siblings to develop your business!\nWe already have famous Industries working with us, such as Peugeot PSA or Decathlon.\nthey are talking about us!\nI'm manufactured & 3D printed locally. That's part of my DNA.\nMy new nursery will be in Goleta, California. I want to be made in the USA.  \nWe also have two homes in France: Lille & Bordeaux. I'm already made in France.  \n... I now want to be manufactured locally,  everywhere.\nFeel free to visit us as soon as you can!\nIf you need help to understand me, to dredge me, to tame me, you will always have a Dago'teammate ready to answer all your questions. You will never be alone in this incredible adventure!\nYou have access to a local pre-sale and after sale service !\nMy parents always taught me to support causes that made sense to me.\nSo we decided, Dagoma and I, to get involved with e-nable, which allows children with agenesis of the hand to get a hand tailored, printed by a member of the community.\nWe are also involved locally in arts. We collaborate with local artists to propose you unique editions of our printers and promote links between art and technology.\nHere is the result of a collaboration with the French artist Aysar :\nNEVA customized by Aysar artist\nPreserving the environment and changing consumption patterns is our very essence. That's why we use the most environmentally friendly products possible. For example, I am printed in PLA, a plastic made of starch. And my parents recycle all our plastic waste to form new filaments .\nWhy do I need your help today? Because we need you to be able to start my new nursery: a 10 000 sqft factory, to manufacture and print me locally.

It makes drinking water a healthy addiction by making it taste closer to soda or juice. The scent and flavoring is safely added to the lid, which can be changed around. (Patent Pending) These flavoring oils have been approved for use both within the EU and by the FDA, are already used in existing beverages on the market, and can last anywhere from 6 to 12 months.\n20 seconds of your time could make a positive difference for someone else. Hydration is important, but so many of us don't get enough of it. Click one of the buttons below and share with someone who could use Flavour Bottle today.\nFlavour has all the flavors that you will love. \nThroughout 2016, we developed five flavors which include: strawberry, watermelon, orange, grape, and cola. \nThese flavors can also be enjoyed with carbonated water, which creates the fizz that many sodas and flavored waters have. \nSo How and Why Does it Work?\nAlthough our taste buds discern a good amount of flavor in 5 sensations (sweet, bitter, salty, sour, and umami), most scientists agree smell accounts for up to 80% of the sensation of taste.\nThrough a patented process, we\u2019ve managed to safely add food grade flavors to a silicone spout on the lids of the Flavour bottle. These are added during the manufacturing process, allowing the scent and flavor to last. \nRather than diffusing quickly, we\u2019ve used a process that gradually brings the flavor and scent to the top of the spout, allowing it to last much longer. Our scents have lasted up to 12 months, depending on the usage of the bottle. Once the scent and flavor is used up, an additional lid can be purchased to replace the old one, without having to replace the bottle. \nThe process is completely safe and is similar to edible waxes being incorporated into paper coffee cups to keep them from leaking. The silicone we are using is the same silicone already used by several other large water bottle companies on the market. \nAs you drink through the spout, you\u2019re also breathing in scented \u201cair\u201d from the straw itself, allowing you to get the full sensation of flavor while drinking water. You're also getting a hint of flavor from the flavoring oils coming through to the surface of the silicone. Structurally, we added a cap so that the scent wouldn't diffuse too quickly. \nWhen you are congested, you lose a bit of the flavor experience.  Food just doesn\u2019t taste as good when you can\u2019t smell. That\u2019s because a special channel connects the roof of the throat to the nose. When we eat and drink foods, odors make their way up through this channel to olfactory cells in the nose. It becomes blocked when we are sick or congested or even if we are consuming something while holding down our nose.\nThere has been a lot of work done in this field of science. Below are just a few of many resources on this topic.\nhttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/05/120530133708.htm\nhttp://www.livescience.com/2737-surprising-impact-taste-smell.html\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/bring-science-home-jelly-bean-taste-smell/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuR6QuWrHrc&t=101s\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJud8MKrvBE\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HxAB54wlig\nIt Really Works!\nWhen we initially begun working on the Flavour Bottle, we had been through many different experiments to really get this concept to work as well as it is claimed by science.\n\nWe spent over three years of research and development to get to a prototype we felt worked for everyone, not just those who have stronger senses of smell. \nOur very first prototype was a scented cap on top of a bottle. One of the first things we realized was that we don\u2019t consciously smell through our nose while eating or drinking. Most of the scent of our food is actually being breathed in through the back of our mouth. We also experimented with creating a scented plastic ring from plastic casting resin to put on top of a bottle.\nOur initial prototypes\nSo our first prototypes did not work nearly as well as we expected them to. They worked similarly to the way a cup would work with a rim to drink from. Although it made the experience of drinking water more pleasant, it did not really add any taste to the water we drank. We had also molded this initial cap out of plastic and fruit flavors, and the scent did not last very long.\nWe began to think, what if we created some sort of drinking spout that was flavored. Its proximity to the mouth while water is being drank would work much better.\n\nAnd Eureka! That is how the Flavour Bottle was born. Inspired by scented silicone bands as well as erasers with scents that have lasted a very long time, we decided to create a food grade silicone spout.\nOur first prototypes were a few food grade silicone straws that had watermelon scents infused into them. We wanted to test these straws out to make sure they conveyed what we felt they would. The positive reinforcement kept us going to develop the bottle fully. \nWe poured water in glasses and invited random students to try it out at the University of Texas at Austin. Check out the results below.\nPLAY\n\n\nThrough a proprietary process, we\u2019ve managed to add the natural flavors that beverage companies use in their drinks and safely insert them into our silicone spout. We are working with a manufacturer that sources food grade flavors that have been approved by both the FDA and the EU. \nThe silicone took in the scent much better than plastic, allowing it to last a lot longer and diffuse a lot slower. Silicone has a characteristic that allows the scent to release when it is rubbed or touched, as opposed to plastic, which diffuses into the air. It is for this reason that the scent within the silicone lasts a lot longer than in plastic. \nSpecifications\nWho is it for?\nOur goal is to make drinking water a healthy addiction just like drinking soda. Water is the healthiest drink at the end of the day, as it does not contain any extra sugars or other harmful ingredients. Many of us do not get enough of it because we gravitate towards unhealthy sodas. We vastly underestimate how much water we really need.  And for those of us who unfortunately suffer from diabetes, these sodas and juices aren\u2019t even an option, so it makes it more difficult to enjoy water with actual flavors and tastes added to it.\nBut What About Flavored Waters and Fruit Infusers?\nWe did a test and looked into the ingredients of several different flavored waters. Most of these ingredients as you can see are preservatives and other questionable ingredients such as aspartame. Plus, they get expensive over time.       \nFruit infusers are awesome, but we don\u2019t always have the time to cut up fruit to add it in to water, plus fruit goes bad quickly and can get expensive. Water is the healthiest drink on the market, without any sugar or added calories, and often times that\u2019s exactly what we need.\nWe\u2019ve also included a cola version and will continue to create more flavors inspired by soda, which cannot be mimicked by infusers.\nAdding carbonated water increases the sensation of cola in the cola flavor.\nRewards\nWe want to wholeheartedly thank you for believing in our vision. You can see our rewards below:     \nWe have worked hard to subsidize our shipping prices while still ensuring a quick delivery after prooduction. We are working with global fulfillment centers to reduce the amount of time shipment would take as well as the cost, which is difficult to reduce typically for international shipping. We are also using a special high barrier pouch to protect the scent on the bottle, which adds a little bit to the cost of shipping. \nAbout Us\n  Where are you in the process?\nWe have spent a long time perfecting our bottle, making sure it works as fantastically as it claims. We are working with a experienced material manufacturer to source food grade silicone as well as flavors from the world's largest flavoring oil company. These are flavors that have been approved for use both by the FDA and within the EU. \nWhat will the funds be used for?\nBringing a brand new product to market has its costs. We have a few working prototypes, but the silicone spouts we are working with have very high MOQs, so we need to raise the funds in order to be able to get a Flavour Bottle into the hands of everyone. This is because the process of using food grade flavors with silicone is a very specialized one and requires a very pristine environment, all of which lead to a high initial startup cost. \nWhat's Next?\nWe are super excited to be able to bring this product to market. The applications are endless, and we truly believe there are many additional modifications we can make over time, by adding more flavors or even adding a filter within the bottle. Below you can see our timeline and where you all have joined in in our journey. We are extremely excited to get this product in your hands, and we won't rest until we do.\nHelp Out by Sharing Flavour Bottle with all your Dehydrated friends. \nIf you like what you\u2019re seeing, you\u2019re awesome! Don\u2019t be shy about sharing it with your equally great friends. It\u2019s so easy. Just hit one of the share buttons.\nThe more people know about the Flavour bottle, the more we can decrease this addiction to sugary drinks that\u2019s plaguing our world today.

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll members of our team have backed Kickstarters that have had their delays and setbacks. No one wants to see a great idea executed poorly. An idea is worthless if it's never brought to fruition. We have spent a lot of time finding the perfect manufacturer for our water bottle, both the silicone part and the main body. Here's what we are doing to minimize any risk to you:\n\nManufacturing: Our most important part of this project is getting the silicone spout manufactured correctly. This means that the scent must be fully incorporated during the manufacturing phase. To really enhance the longevity of the silicone, we've worked with experts in the field of scent encapsulation, who have spent almost a decade developing this technology.\n\nProduct Adjustments: We want to deliver the best Flavour bottle to you, our backers who have put faith in us. That is why we encourage discussion throughout our process with our backers. If there is something we can do to improve the end product, we will consult with our manufacturers but also consult directly with our backers. Any modifications made will always be conveyed directly, and we promise to be honest and upfront.\n\nFulfillment: We've seen Kickstarter campaigns where a manufacturer did not deliver as promised or had issues with production machinery, which trickled down into the entire campaign. For production of the bottle itself, we have two back-up manufacturers that can handle the situation if something goes awry with our main manufacturer.

At present, these courses often lack a machine vision component. This is mainly, we believe, because there is no simple machine vision device one can use together with the Raspberry Pi, Arduino, or similar device used in these courses. JeVois aims to fill this gap by providing a self-contained, configurable machine vision engine that can deliver both visual outputs of how it is analyzing what it sees (useful to understand the algorithms), and text outputs over a serial link that describe what it has found (useful to send to a micro-controller that can control a robot).\nOverview\nThe JeVois framework operates as follows: video is captured from the camera sensor, processed on the fly through some machine vision algorithm directly on the camera's own processor, and the results are streamed over USB to a host computer and/or over serial to a micro-controller.\nTo the host computer, the JeVois smart camera is just another USB camera. Different vision algorithms are selected by changing USB camera resolution and framerate. Users or machines can also interact with the JeVois smart camera, change its settings, or listen for text-based vision outputs over serial link (both hardware serial and serial-over-USB are supported).\nThree major modes of operation:\nDemo/development mode: the smart camera outputs a demo display over USB that shows the results of its analysis, possibly along with simple results communicated over serial port (e.g., coordinates and content of any QRcode that has been identified).\nText-only mode: the smart camera provides no USB output, but only text strings, for example, commands for a pan/tilt controller.\nPre-processing mode: the smart camera outputs video that is intended for machine consumption, for example an edge map computed over the video frames captured by the camera sensor, or a set of image crops around the 3 most interesting objects in the scene. This video can then be further processed by the host computer, for example, using a massive deep neural network running on a cluster of high-power GPUs to recognize the three most interesting objects that the smart camera has detected. Text outputs over serial are of course also possible in this mode.\nBut, really, anything is possible, since the whole JeVois software framework is open-source.\nHardware Specs\nAt a glance:\n A brief tour:\nThe JeVois smart camera is a complete Linux computer. It can run on its own, without a host PC. Thanks to the cooling fan, it can run under full processing load without overheating and while maintaining a constant 1.34 GHz CPU speed.\n Software Specs\nA few examples (watch the video for more). All results shown below are computed on the JeVois camera itself. The smart camera does all the work, including image capture, vision processing, and creating the demo displays. The host computer only runs a standard video camera software (e.g., guvcview on a Linux host) to display the smart camera's results.\nVisual Attention detects interesting things in the world\n In the above, the algorithm processing speed is 73.1 fps on the smart camera's processor, that is, it takes 13.68 ms to process one video frame. The camera sensor captures frames at 60 fps (16.67 ms per frame), which sets the video streaming speed. One could run some additional algorithms during the 3 ms difference. Also note that the CPU is not fully loaded by this algorithm (148.7% load, while 400% would correspond to fully loading all 4 CPU cores). Hence additional algorithms could also run in parallel with visual attention.\nAugmented reality markers (ArUco)\n  Object detection and recognition\n  Road detection for autonomous driving\n  120Hz eye tracking (camera streams at 120 fps, processing runs at 200+ fps)\nand see many more in the campaign video.\nThis is an open-source project. Anyone can contribute. Which vision algorithms will you create?\nHost Computer Requirements\nThe JeVois smart camera can work as a standalone computer, with no USB video streaming. In such case, one would usually simply stream commands to an Arduino or similar over the serial port. All you need then is to provide power to the JeVois camera's mini-USB connector.\nFor video streaming over USB:\nLinux (including Raspberry Pi): Works out of the box, no drivers needed, all functionality is available. You can switch between different vision processing modes on the fly and at runtime, by selecting different camera resolutions and frame rates on your host computer. For example, 640x300@60fps may run the visual attention algorithm, while 320x256@60fps may run the QRcode detection algorithm. A configuration file on the MicroSD card establishes the mapping between USB video resolution and frame rate, camera sensor resolution and frame rate, and vision algorithm to run.\nWindows, Mac OS X: Streaming works but selecting among different available video resolutions has become increasingly difficult with newer versions of Windows and OS X. It seems that these operating systems do not want to let you choose a camera resolution or frame rate. This choice, however, is how one can switch on the fly between different vision algorithms on the JeVois camera. One workaround is to configure your JeVois smart camera with only one vision algorithm (achieved by commenting out entries for other resolutions in a configuration file on the MicroSD card). Then the host computer will have no choice but to use that one.\nAndroid: The camera is detected but streaming video does not work yet. We are working on this and we suspect this has to do with deviations from the USB video class (UVC) standard on the Android side. For example, a USB packet sniffer has revealed that the Android device insists on querying camera controls that were not declared as being supported by the JeVois hardware.\niOS: The JeVois smart camera, and any other USB camera we have tried, are currently reported as not being a supported device. This may change in the future.\nConnecting to Arduino or similar\nDeveloping for JeVois\nEverything is cross-compiled on a host computer. At present only Linux is supported for compiling JeVois software. JeVois software is written in C++17, with a few low-level algorithms in optimized C. We use CMake to manage the build process. This allows you to build for both your host computer and for the JeVois hardware, both at the same time. This is very useful during development, since you can test your algorithms using any USB webcam and observe the results in a window on your screen. You can also use your host computer to train a deep neural network quickly, and then just load the weights onto your MicroSD card. The JeVois operating system is Linux and its features are managed by buildroot.\nScripts are provided to automate the process:\nrebuild-host.sh - compile the entire JeVois software suite natively on a host computer. You can use it with a USB webcam, and it display outputs in a window on your screen.\nrebuild-platform.sh - cross-compile the entire JeVois software suite for the smart camera hardware.\njevois-build.sh - flash the cross-compiled results from rebuild-platform.sh to a MicroSD card.\nContributions & novelty\nIn principle, you could assemble a working machine vision system using existing embedded computer boards, adding a camera, and programming a USB output. In fact, this how we started... - er, two years ago!\nThe hurdles we encountered and solved in creating JeVois are as follows:\n- Linux support for camera chips is often very limited. We wrote our own highly efficient kernel driver and figured out how to configure undocumented camera chip registers to support all the controls available on the camera (exposure, frame rate, etc). Most camera drivers in the Linux kernel only support one or a few resolutions and frame rates, many do not support controls such as manual exposure, etc. You could use a USB camera, for which support for the controls has been standardized, but not many support 60 or 120 frames/s, and they would increase the overall size, weight, power and cost of the system. Our kernel camera driver exploits hardware that is integrated into our CPU chip for direct image capture from a camera sensor. This is faster, provides lower latency (time between image capture and start of rocessing), and uses less CPU resources than attaching a USB camera sensor.\n- Linux support for the device-side of video streaming over USB is virtually non-existent (in open source). This is software that you need to run on the smart camera's CPU to make it appear as if it was a USB camera to a connected host computer. A webcam gadget module has been present in the Linux kernel source tree for several years, but its functionality is very limited, and, as we discovered, its very core logic is broken. We developed a fully working device-side kernel USB Video Class driver, with highly efficient data streaming and pass-through support for video resolutions, pixel formats, frame rates, and camera controls (when users change those on the host computer, the changes are relayed to the camera sensor chip).\n- Many small embedded computer boards exist, but software support is often limited, and quality sometimes is low. We had to fix kernel USB drivers, kernel GPU drivers, kernel camera drivers, and many other elements in the Linux kernel to make it work flawlessly while supporting all the features listed above. Small embedded boards also are no match for our solution in terms of total system size (including camera, connectors, fan), power consumption, speed and video latency (delay between capturing an image and presenting the processing results to the host computer), and out-of-the box enjoyment and reliability. For example, one has to face the reality that a quad-core chip will just overheat under load if it does not have a fan or very, very large heatsink.\nWe employed special design and manufacturing techniques which enabled us to deliver a complete, self-contained system in a tiny form factor. As an example, we run our DDR3 memory at its full rated clock speed (DDR3-1600), while other ARM boards we have surveyed on the market sometimes run at just half that speed. We achieved optimum speed as the result of extremely detailed circuit board design and optimization, and through the use of custom design, simulation, and fabrication tools. It makes a big difference for many vision processing algorithms (about 15% faster).\nIn summary, because we are developing the hardware, software and mechanical design jointly, we are able to deliver a highly optimized, plug-and-play, high satisfaction solution that just does not exist anywhere else today.\nLong-Term Vision\nWith JeVois we aim to enable everyone to use machine vision in embedded, IoT, robotics, and educational projects. While this campaign is to help us bootstrap the mass manufacturing of the hardware, we continue to work on the following open-source software aspects:\nSoftware development is gearing up to provide a repository of machine vision modules shared by the community. This is the equivalent of an app store for JeVois. It is expected to come online by February, before the devices start shipping.\nWe are developing a curriculum of activities around the JeVois camera for all levels (from kindergarten to Ph.D.). Activities will start at the entry level (just point the camera towards something and see whether it can identify it), to learning how the underlying machine vision algorithms work, to modifying existing algorithms, and finally learning vision theory and developing your own algorithms. This is expected to become available in April. We will leverage significant material we have developed by teaching robotics, vision, and artificial intelligence courses at the undergraduate and graduate level over the past 15 years.\nOur overall mission is an educational and outreach one. We hope that JeVois will help us and others translate the latest vision research results into working machines. JeVois will be integrated to our outreach activities, which include working with neighboring K-12 schools, our Robotics Open House program, and others. We have a small budget already available for outreach, which includes loaning and donating some JeVois hardware to interested students. Details will be available in February.\nComparison to the Raspberri Pi 3 model B\nRewards\nRewards include barebones kits and turnkey kits in several quantities. Choose a barebones kit if you already have microSD cards and mini-USB cables and do not need more of those. Choos a turnkey kit if you want to be ready to run out the box.\nColors\nChoose your colors in the backer survey after you place your pledge. Note that with the lighter colors, you will see the LED shine through the plastic case and make a small halo around the hole in the case for the LED. You may want this for better visibility or not if you find it distracting. The color that makes the most sense from a machine vision standpoint is black.\nThanks\nThis campaign is basically to build a batch of units that achieves low mass production costs. Please help us spread the word if you like this project.

It definitely is the perfect travel companion.\nWith OSTRICH PILLOW GO we want to make sure that not a single person is excluded because of his or her neck proportions.\nTo use OSTRICH PILLOW GO, simply place it around your neck and fix it without fuss thanks to its hidden magnetic buttons.\nIts three different positions guarantee a perfect fit and adaptation to your neck whatever its size. Then you're set to go and enjoy comfy dreams.\nThe secret behind OSTRICH PILLOW GO's unique comfort lies inside. The viscoelastic core of the pillow is made out of high-sensitivity memory foam. The foam core has a protective cotton fabric layer around it. The outermost layer is a removable and washable sleeve made out of skin-friendly stretchable fabric.\nOur team has worked hard to find a universal shape that would provide optimal headrest for different neck types. \nOSTRICH PILLOW GO's carefully chosen materials are able to reduce dramatic in volume, which is extremely convenient for travelling.\nWe've spent months testing hundreds of foam samples until we got to the nap-perfect consistency that guarantees dream-level comfort and compact transport for hardcore travellers.   \nOSTRICH PILLOW GO is the latest in the OSTRICH PILLOW saga of napping classics.\nWe are Studio Banana Things, the design studio behind the idea. We first launched the OSTRICH PILLOW ORIGINAL in Kickstarter in 2012 and the campaign was a total success that went viral on global media. Since then we've created the commute-friendly LIGHT and the discreet MINI versions, also to great public and Kickstarter acclaim.\nEarlier this year we thought that the next member of the OSTRICH PILLOW family should focus on providing perfect neck support and be super compact for diehard travellers. Our design team has spent the last few months studying the anatomy of the neck, analysing emerging travel habits, researching materials and patterns, visiting manufacturers and restlessly improving the design until we got to a really satisfactory point.\nWe're super excited to bring OSTRICH PILLOW GO to you and can't wait to press the button GO at the factory thanks to your support.\n  Designing OSTRICH PILLOW GO we have leveraged on all our knowledge on napping pillows accumulated over the years. We have done our homework and in parallel to working on the design of the product we have identified the different suppliers and manufacturers that are in a capacity to produce the product from the get-go (no pun intended).\nA particular aspect about memory foam is that it needs to be injected in a mould for manufacturing. The great news is that we have already made that initial investment and we have the mould ready at the factory.\nThe supply of the special lining fabric is another critical aspect and we are happy to inform you that we have the material ready to be ordered. If our campaign goes well we'll be proposing as stretch goals different fabric patterns so get ready to make your choice!\nThe final key aspect is packaging. The design is very advanced and we're finalising the manufacturing details. You'll surely get news from us about this aspect during the campaign.\nMany in the Kickstarter community may already know about us, Studio Banana Things. We are a passionate group of designers who love to imagine new worlds and develop fun and functional solutions for people on the go.\nWe are best known for the OSTRICH PILLOW family, which has turned heads internationally for the last 3 years. We are also recognised for other award-winning designs which have been exhibited in places such as the Museum of Modern Art New York.\nKickstarter, with its smart and active community of backers, is the perfect platform for us to explore our latest ideas. We are keen to listen and learn from you during this campaign and need you every step of the way.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPerfection and outstanding levels of customer service are at the core of our values and we like being frank with our fans and supporters.\n\nOSTRICH PILLOW GO is a new product and like with all Kickstarter campaigns you will be the first to receive it and be mega wowed, we are sure of this!!! When you see OSTRICH PILLOW GO in retail, you must show off to your friends you made the manufacturing possible.\n\nMoving from prototype to production brings challenges at times. We have minimised the possibility of ugly bumps on the road by advancing a great deal in the manufacturing preparation. We have a ready-to-use mould and a ready-to-start manufacturing partner, with all fabric suppliers lined up. This guarantees we can stick to our planned timeline.\n\nDuring our previous Kickstarter launch's we encountered some hurdles and aim to avoid these 100%. Some of these issues were relating to logistics matters, we have addressed all of these aspects (we don't like repeating the same issues). Due to some of these hurdles we have regrettably had to reduce the number of countries we can ship to in order to avoid compromising delivery lead times.\n\nOf course some international customs, certification, logistic delays, and Force Majeure may occasionally show their ugly head.

Thermal design and the step up to x5-Z8350 delayed the UP Board project. With the next generation UP\u00b2 (UP Squared), we are taking a different path on thermal design, using all our knowledge gained from UP. \n\nWith UP\u00b2 (UP Squared) we have spent more than two months discussing all specifications and component placement. We've driven all product capabilities in once, therefore we remain confident that no more upgrade options need to be managed later on. We've brought together a logistic team in-house, this will assist us in providing a delivery plan and handle all orders efficiently!\n\nWe had to work with LPDDR4 technology for the first time together with a complete new architecture that hasn\u2019t reached the market yet. Just a few days back, we amended the design to enhance the memory bandwidth. Now, we are working on developing the drivers for Altera FPGA MAX 10 to control the 40 Pin I/O as well as the 60 Pin. We are also improving layout optimixations and eMMC firmware boot.\n\nUP\u00b2 (UP Squared) is the answer to all applications.\n.\nAre you up for UP\u00b2 (UP Squared) ?

Plastic bottled water is convenient but does so much permanent damage to our planet. \nLet's all start doing something now to prevent this from happening!\nSo we created que Bottle, the only collapsible bottle that can travel with you and looks absolutely awesome. Unique spiral design shrinks que bottle to half of its size without sacrificing its stylish appeal.\nFeatured on:\n              Made of 100% BPA-free food-grade silicone, que Bottle is 100% plastic-free, making it safe for people and the planet. It\u2019s lightweight and compact, taste and odor free, stain and bacteria resistant, dishwasher safe, and safe to use for both hot (up to 140F) and cold beverages. Plus, we are offering two size: high-capacity 20 fl oz for everyday use and 12 fl oz bottle for travelers and kids. Collapsed que bottle can be used as a small-sized bottle, making it even more versatile.\nThe Silicone Material\nWhy did we choose to use silicone to make que Bottle?\nThe que Bottle is tested for its high and pure grade silicone quality because we understand that the container that holds your water should be safe. Unlike metal or plastic containers, silicone WILL NOT change the taste of your water. It's the water bottle that has the best qualities of glass and metal, with the added benefit of being flexible, light, and shatter resistant.\nThe Functions\nCollapsible: shrinks to half its size to fit anywhere\nOne push, easy collapse\nCollapses into a small size to fit in bags and pockets\n Wide mouth:fits ice cubes\n Safe for hot beverages: up to 140\u00b0F (60\u00b0C)\nSafe to use for hot coffee, tea, and cleaning with boiling water\n Easy to clean: dishwasher safe \n Durable: Collapse and expand over and over again\n Leakproof: airtight secure seals\nLeak-proof que Bottle makes sure your bag stays dry\n Shockproof: shock resistant \nNo damages caused if dropped by accident\n 100% food-grade silicone: FDA/LFGB approved\n 18/8 stainless steel cap: top kitchenware grade stainless steel\n 100% plastic-free: NO plastic material used for que bottle, 100% GREEN!\n The new travel essential, the bottle that travels with you everywhere.\n Never without a bottle again!\nIt's more than just a water bottle, beautifully crafted que Bottle is also a fashion accessory!\nHelp save the environment in the most stylish way possible!\n Four vibrant colors:\nSleek design and vibrant colors will suit your daily styles\n                   Stretch Goals:\nHi, we are Jean and Kevin, the creators of que Bottle. We like to travel all over the world and it deeply upsets us that we see a lot of used and abandoned plastic bottles everywhere we go.\nWe realized that the reason people were still buying highly marked-up plastic bottled water at public places was for the sake of convenience. There simply isn't a good alternative travel bottle available. Current water bottles are either bulky, making them impossible to carry around, or dull-looking and cheap-made foldable flasks.\nSo we wanted to make something that\u2019s functional but also looks great. We came up with the initial design and worked day and night for 12 months to bring it to fruition.\nGet Your Project Funded Today!\nGet Cash Back on the Projects You Love!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are dedicated to setting our brand and product standards high, and we will do our absolutely best to fulfill deliveries to you, our backers!\n\nWe have passed our prototype and testing stage successfully, and we are confidently entering the mass production stage.\n\nHowever, shipping a large number of products at once can be challenging considering we have a relatively small team.

Hit one of the buttons below and tag a friend or coworker who can't stop fidgeting!\n        How do I use it?\nIt's simple. Fidget Cube (patent pending) has six sides. Each side features something to fidget with:\n              Fidgeting that matches your style.\nFidget Cube is available in 10 different color schemes:\nDice, Graphite, Midnight, Aqua, Sunset, Berry, Fresh, Retro, Kickstarter Edition, and Backer Designed (design voted on by the Fidget Family!).\n            Why fidget?\nWe love this question. It's not uncommon to hear fidgeting being spoken about negatively. It's often labeled as unprofessional and deemed as anti-intellectual behavior.\nBut in reality, the exact opposite has been suggested to be the case. Below are just some of many resources highlighting the work that's being done to learn more about this behavior:\nThe Science Of Why We Fidget While We Work\nSquirm With Purpose\nStress Toys: Mindlessness With A Purpose?\nThe Benefits Of Fidgeting For Students With ADHD\nWhy Do We Fidget?\nUsing Stress Balls To Focus The Attention Of Students\nWe believe that the way we look at fidgeting needs to change.\nThis behavior isn't one that should continue to be stigmatized and mocked as unbecoming or inappropriate. We are passionate about the idea that fidgeting is a process that, with the right tools and outlet, can have positive and real-life applications.\n  Where can I use Fidget Cube?\n  It was incredibly important to us that the design of Fidget Cube was one that would look great on any desk, whether that desk belonged to a student or a CEO.\nThere are really no limits to when and where you can use Fidget Cube. Use it while listening to a lecture, or while studying for that upcoming test. Use it in the next meeting you have to attend (or lead). Use it at your desk while working on projects. Enduring a lengthy commute and need to relieve some stress? Fidget away. Marathoning a Netflix series? Yep, you can fidget then too.\n  But I already have a pen. Do I really need Fidget Cube?\nPens (and the wonderful clicking they do) were a huge inspiration in the design process of Fidget Cube. They are probably one of the most commonly used fidget \"tools\". We like to see Fidget Cube as more of a fidget \"toolbox\". You don't have to be constrained to simple clicking, you can pick your poison based on your mood. Yes... We are very serious about our fidgeting.\n  I don't really fidget. Would I enjoy Fidget Cube?\nWe think so! Not everyone fidgets the same amount. But spending the last few years deeply interested in the process of fidgeting, we've observed the fact that almost everyone fidgets to some extent, in a variety of ways.\nMaybe you're not the type of person who uses objects like paper clips or pencils to fidget with. If that's the case, it's very likely you fidget in some other way, such as bouncing your knee up and down, tapping your foot, or picking at lint in your pocket.\nWe believe that Fidget Cube provides a tangible way to capture your floating attention, regardless of whether you fidget consciously or subconsciously.\n  Rewards.\nFor believing in our vision, we want to thank you! Check out our rewards below:\n    Stretch Goals.\n         The Team.\n  We're Antsy Labs, and more specifically, Matthew and Mark McLachlan - brothers that have a passion for designing solutions to problems we come across in daily life.\nWhere are you in the process?\nAfter handfuls of prototypes, we've tweaked every last detail to arrive at the Fidget Cube you see today. We've got a number of working units, but in order to make enough for you to have one as well, we need to place a substantial minimum order for the first production run of Fidget Cube. That's why we're offering Fidget Cube to this awesome community before anyone else.\nWhat does your timeline look like?\nFidget Cube has been an idea we've been dying to bring to fruition since it was first conceived in 2012. The product you're seeing in this project is the result of innumerable hours of iterating and reiterating. We're perfectionists, and we wanted to make sure we got this one right.\nBelow, you'll see a brief outline of the journey we're on with Fidget Cube, starting from the first discussion about it to when all of you joined the story (and where we go from here)!\nWe are insanely excited to get Fidget Cube into your hands. So you can be sure that we're going to continue to work day and night until the very last Fidget Cube has shipped.\n  Help Out By Sharing Fidget Cube With Your Friends! (#fidgetfever)\nLike what you're seeing? Great! Don't be shy about sharing Fidget Cube with your friends. We've made it super easy. Just hit one of the buttons below (or at the top of the page).\nThe more people who know about Fidget Cube, the larger our community will become! And the larger the community, the better we'll be able to make Fidget Cube!\nWe can't do this without you!\n        Questions?\nAsk away! Shoot us a message or post a comment and we'll do our best to get back to you with an answer.\nFeedback?\nGot a creative idea you think we should implement with Fidget Cube? Don't hesitate - let us know! Fidget Cube is being made possible by you, and we want you to be a part of the creative process as well.\nInternational Backers\nThis project isn't just for backers in the United States. We'll be shipping Fidget Cube worldwide!\nThat being said, there are unique processes that apply specifically to international backers that we'd like you to be aware of. Please note that there is no way for us to charge any additional amount on our end for any applicable VAT/duties that may be a result of a specific country's local tax code. Therefore, these fees may be incurred upon receipt of your reward. These fees are the responsibility of each backer, and additional information regarding VAT/duties can be found in our FAQ below.\nIn addition, due to first class shipping fees and the dimensions of Fidget Cube, shipping rates may seem a bit high for some international locations. We calculated shipping rates beforehand, and are able to swallow some of the shipping costs on orders of 1 or 2 Fidget Cubes. Please note that shipping becomes completely free when you pledge for 5 or more Fidget Cubes.\nSome Final Thoughts.\nWhile we strongly believe in the many benefits of fidgeting, we aren't claiming to cure any illness or condition. Fidget Cube is a fun, unique way to customize your fidgeting. When designing Fidget Cube we were inspired by research that claims fidgeting might actually help individuals focus their attention. We have personally found that it helps us stay focused in boring meetings and while working on projects.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis isn't our first rodeo.

Since the advent of voice interaction technology, our life has truly become easier in many ways.\nWe think we can take advantage of this technology, and achieve more with it \u2013 ReSpeaker provides an open source, modular voice interface that allows us to hack things around us, just using our voices.\nRather than a voice assistant that fulfills simple tasks only when you asked, ReSpeaker provides a hands-free way of voice interaction for you and your surroundings. \nWith ReSpeaker, you are able to control, or even communicate with your toy robot, your home appliances, your plant, your office, your internet-equipped devices and many other things in your daily life.\nMore detail about the Stretch Goal 1 please go to: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seeed/respeaker-an-open-modular-voice-interface-to-hack/posts/1663367\nMore detail about the Stretch Goal 2 please go to: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seeed/respeaker-an-open-modular-voice-interface-to-hack/posts/1679978\nPowered by the MT7688 Wi-Fi module and the built-in high performance microphone, ReSpeaker responds to your voice and recognize your speeches based on powerful online cognitive services like Microsoft Cognitive Service, Amazon Alexa Voice Service, Google Speech API, Wit.ai and Houndify.\nAlso with the on board SD card slot to extend the storage and the integrated lightweight speech recognition engine - the PocketSphinx, ReSpeaker works equally well for keywords spotting when offline. You can have a large vocabulary and audio files stored in local storage to implement the speech recognition at anytime, anywhere, even without the internet.\nSetting up ReSpeaker is super easy and only takes a few minutes.\nWithout any App installation, you can start by connecting ReSpeaker to your WiFi network and then directly use our Web-based App to access a range of rich featured applications that ReSpeaker has provided, includes music streaming, file manager, plug-in, customized settings and more.\nVoice interface has never been apart from music entertainment, so does ReSpeaker. \nReSpeaker supports Airplay/DLNA for wireless music streaming. Just connect ReSpeaker to any ordinary speaker with an AUX cable, then you can start enjoying the music you love without pressing a single button.\nOf course we want to explore more possibilities coming out from ReSpeaker, and to achieve that we believe the best way is to leverage the power of the open source community. ReSpeaker runs the OpenWrt system that is based on Linux, which makes it 100% friendly to developers. \nAnd provided with our detailed and easy-to-use SDK, developers are able to develop more applications using Python on Linux. ReSpeaker also supports other popular programming languages like C/C++, Arduino, JavaScript and Lua.\nReSpeaker is not limited to what it can do for now, it is always growing. We\u2019ve developed a plug-in system that would continuously expand ReSpeaker\u2019s features and functionalities in the future. \nOur team will keep adding more plug-ins for ReSpeaker to cover as many things as possible that people want to have voice interactions with. \nAdvanced users can also develop their own plug-ins using our user-friendly Python APIs. All the plug-ins will be shared on the Web APP and free-to-download for everyone.  \nIn addition to the plug-in system, ReSpeaker is also extendable with plug-n-play hardware add-ons. \nThe far-field MIC Array allows your ReSpeaker to be able to recognize your location and hear you from across the room even while the music is playing. \nAnd the Grove extension board brings even more possibilities as you can connect various Grove sensors and actuators to extend its capabilities. The two onboard expansion headers also offer I2S, I2C, AUX, USB 2.0, GPIOs and many other interfaces that you can use for more applications.\nYou might wondering why ReSpeaker does not have speaker. In fact it does. We've cooperated with Meow King Audio Electronic Company and develop the Meow King Drive Unit. It can be directly connected to the bottom of ReSpeaker Core to produce beautiful sound out of it.\nAll the add-ons are modularized and have an identical disk design same as the core board. They can be stacked to one another when they are connected through soldering-free pins and header.\nTo improve the voice interaction experience, we developed the ReSpeaker Mic Array based on the XVSM-2000 Smart Microphone from XMOS. The board integrates 7 PDM microphones to help enhance ReSpeaker's acoustic DSP performance to a much higher level. With the Mic Array attached onto the top of the ReSpeaker Core, the Core is now able to: \nHear You From Far Away\nFocus On Your Voice\n Improve Your Voice Quality\nThe exposed PCB design does not mean ReSpeaker is just for people who knows a lot about hardware or software. \nThe plug-in system is designed for the community to share and download their voice interactive projects as a simple plug-in to the ReSpeaker module. It has significantly simplified the use of ReSpeaker as anyone who has a ReSpeaker can install the plug-ins they want with a single click, and after that they can run voice interaction just like any others. \nDevelopers can of course achieve more with the SDK we provide to develop their own voice interaction projects .\nFor beginners, we have step-by-step tutorials and recipes to help you getting started with your first project with ReSpeaker.\nRather than the on board MT7688 Wi-FI module which runs the Linux based OpenWrt, ReSpeaker is also powered by the ATmega32u4 chip and it\u2019s absolutely Arduino compatible, which means, we can use ReSpeaker as a powerful Arduino board and do many \u2018Arduino\u2019 things. It\u2019s for learning, it\u2019s for practicing, and it\u2019s for fun.\nFor example, you can program it with Arduino IDE to have a special DIY piano that is built on 8 cherry tomatoes connecting to the 8 touch sensors of ReSpeaker.\nWe are making ReSpeaker compatible with our previous project the Wio Link and the subsequent members of the Wio family the Wio Node and the Wio Core.\nWio Link is an ESP8266 based open-source Wi-Fi development board to create IoT applications by virtualizing plug-n-play Grove modules to RESTful APIs with mobile APPs. \nMore information about Wio Link can be either find at our previous Kickstarter Campaign :\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seeed/wio-link-3-steps-5-minutes-build-your-iot-applicat/description\nor at Wio Link's official website:\nhttp://iot.seeed.cc/\nThere are videos demonstrate what is Wio Link and how easy it is to build an Internet of Things application with Wio Link,\nHow exactly does ReSpeaker works with the Wio Link/Node/Core?\nThe introduction of the Wio family has truly brought what ReSpeaker can do to a higher level. \nTo user ReSpeaker with Wio, simply pair your ReSpeaker to your Wio product using our Web App, then you can have a voice interaction with any of your IoT devices that is built on Wio. Like voice control your Pet Feeder built with Wio to dispense treats, or ask your Wio based Smart Plant if she need some water. \nCheck out the following demoes to see the VOICE INTERACTION BETWEEN YOU AND...\nFor each ReSpeaker Core reward it also comes with a 8G Class 10 Micro SD Card. \n ReSpeaker Core Module\n- AI7688 Wi-Fi Module\nOperation system: GNU/Linux based OpenWrt\nWi-Fi Network: Support Legacy 802.11b/g and HT 802.11n modes  \nExpansion: Two expansion headers for I2C, GPIO and USB 2.0 host \nInterfaces: Built-in 3.5mm AUX port, Micro USB and SD card slot \n- ATMega32U4 Coprocessor  \nUSB CDC virtual serial port for linux console\n12 programmable RGB LED indicators  \n8 on board touch sensors\n- Codec WM8960\nDAC SNR 98dB (\u2018A\u2019 weighted), THD -84dB at 48kHz, 3.3V  \nADC SNR 94dB (\u2018A\u2019 weighted), THD -82dB at 48kHz, 3.3V  \nStereo Class D Speaker Driver with 87% efficiency (1W output)  \nOn-chip Headphone Driver  \n40mW output power into 16\u03a9 at 3.3V  \nTHD -75dB at 20mW, SNR 90dB with 16\u03a9 load  \nOn-chip PLL provides flexible clocking scheme  \nSample rates: 8, 11.025, 12, 16, 22.05, 24, 32, 44.1, 48 kHz\n- Power Supply: 5V DC  \n- Dimensions: 70mm diameter  \n- Weight: 17g\n\n\nMic Array\nXMOS microcontroller with 16 cores inside  \n7 high performance digital microphones\nSupports Far-field Voice Capture (up to 10m)\nSupports Beamforming, Acoustic Source Localization, Nosie Suppression, De-reverberation and Acoustic Echo Cancellation\n12 programmable RGB LED indicators  \nMicrophones: ST MP34DT01-M  \nSensitivity: -26 dBFS (Omnidirectional)  \nAcoustic overload point: 120 dBSPL  \nSNR: 61 dB  \nPower Supply: 5V DC from Micro USB or expansion header  \nDimensions: 70mm (Diameter)  \nWeight: 15.25g\nGrove Extension Board\nGrove Ports: 10\nDigital I/Os: 3\nAnalog I/Os: 4\nI2C Interface: 2\nUART: 1\nDimensions: 70mm (Diameter)\nWeight: 15.25g\nMeow King Drive Unit\nRated Power: 5W\nImpedance: 4\u03a9\nSNR: \u2265 75dBA\nSensitivity: 550 \u00b1 50mV\nDegree of Distortion: \u2264 0.5% \nFrequency Response: 85Hz - 20kHz\nPower Supply: 5V through USB or through 3.7V, 1500mAh battery\nSpeaker Diameter:  40mm\nSeeed has always been an open Source hardware innovation platform from the very beginning.

ZEEQ is not just another device or accessory, it is an active participant in your sleep. ZEEQ can play music to help you fall asleep, monitor and react to your snoring, analyze your sleep and intelligently wake you up. Unlike other sleep technology ZEEQ actually responds to the data it collects.\n    ZEEQ will help you fall asleep by allowing you to listen to music through the pillow and letting you choose music from your favorite sources. You can set a sleep timer in the app so the music will stop automatically - that way you can focus on sleep. We have even created some new relaxing tracks (some even using binaural beats) to help you fall asleep faster and achieve even more restful sleep.\nIf ZEEQ hears snoring, it will gently vibrate the pillow to encourage a new sleeping position. \nYour natural sleep movements are recorded and used to wake you up at the ideal moment in your sleep cycle, making groggy mornings a thing of the past. Most importantly, ZEEQ is the most comfortable pillow you will ever own. \n All the technology in the world will never be more important than softness, support, and premium materials, but luckily ZEEQ integrates technology and comfort seamlessly.\nMake sleep a priority no matter your lifestyle. ZEEQ integrates into your existing sleep habits and improves your sleep without you even being aware of it.  \n ZEEQ links to a smartphone app, so you can see your sleep data, including your Snore Score. If you want to take it a step farther, the app can help you track your diet, exercise and other habits to analyze how these factors effect your sleep, so you can make changes toward more restful slumber.\n                The ZEEQ Difference\nThe ZEEQ pillow will improve your sleep quality and quantity in multiple ways.\nIf you fall asleep better with music, REM-Fit Audio lets you stream music wirelessly, so you don\u2019t have to sleep with headphones in and you won\u2019t disturb your partner. You can even use one of the REM-Fit soundscapes if you prefer a more ambient experience.\nPLAY\n\nThe Snore Alarm uses a built in microphone with decibel sensitivity to hear snoring, and responds by gently vibrating the pillow to encourage the user to change positions without waking them up. \nPLAY\n\nAs soon as you go to bed, ZEEQ will start to monitor your sleep. It uses a 3-axis gyroscope to detect your motion throughout the night and provide data on the quality of your sleep.\nPLAY\n\nSmart Wake senses where you are in your sleep cycle based on these movements, and wakes you up at the ideal moment in a predetermined time range. It will use soft vibrations to wake you gently without affecting your partner. \nPLAY\n\nMost importantly, ZEEQ is the most comfortable pillow you will ever own. REM-Fit is an expert in pillows and bedding, and will never sacrifice comfort for technology. A cozy, supportive memory foam shell and soft, durable Tencell pillow case make this pillow a dream to lay your head on. \nPLAY\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nFall asleep effortlessly, sleep peacefully and wake up rejuvenated.\nAren\u2019t you ready to see how it feels to be rested and energized for the two thirds of your life that you spend awake?\n    The ZEEQ App\nZEEQ integrates with a smartphone app to deliver sleep and snore data. You can use as few or as many of ZEEQ\u2019s features as you want, and you can customize each one to your preference. \n\nWant to turn down the vibration strength of your pillow?\nWant to listen to Spotify as you fall asleep? \n\nAll this and more can be controlled from the ZEEQ app. \n See your 7 day trends on the app's dashboard. Find out how well you fared on sleep quality and snore score.\nZEEQ is an active participant in your sleep, and if you want to be an active participant too you can use the manual features provided in the app such as diet, caffeine and alcohol consumption, exercise tracking and more. \n As the app learns more about your habits, both while asleep and while awake, it can detect patterns and correlations and start to make suggestions on how to improve your sleep quality.\n  Bonus Rewards\nWhen you back either of our Bonus Pack reward levels, you will receive one or more REM-Fit Activity Trackers. The activity tracker is the perfect compliment to your ZEEQ pillow because it tracks your activity during the day while ZEEQ monitors your sleep, and they both use the same app for integrated information.\nFeatures:\n\u2022 Track your steps, distance and calories burned\n\u2022 ActivePoints - ActivePoints reward you for more than just your steps by analyzing the intensity and duration of your activity. The more active you are in a day, the more ActivePoints you can earn. \n\u2022 360 LifeScore - Strive for a great night of sleep and a day of activity. Your SleepPoints and ActivePoints contribute to an overall 360 LifeScore.\nSpecifications\n  Dimensions: 21\u201dx 27\u201d, the standard pillow size \nMaterials: Tencel pillowcase, memory foam outer shell, comfort filling \nBattery: 5000 mAh rechargeable, lasts approximately 1 week\nElectronics: 3-Axis gyroscope, vibration motors, individual decibel tuned microphone, 8 precision placed speakers\nReward Levels\n     Project Development \nAll the heavy lifting is done; we are already near completion on our design and engineering. We have several functional samples of the pillow. We already have manufacturers for all our components and have visited the factories in Shenzhen, Shanghai and India 8 separate times.\n  There are a few big steps left to take: tooling, international testing and manufacturing. Your support will help us produce our first order of ZEEQ!\nThe good news for supporters is that the wait for the finished product will be short - you will have ZEEQ under your head in less than 6 months!\nTimeline\n Get Your Project Funded Today!\nwww.funded.today/get-more-pledges \nAbout the Company \nPLAY\n\n\nREM-Fit is a team of dedicated individuals who believe in a restful night\u2019s sleep. \nBeing fitness enthusiasts, we know how important rest and recovery are to any training routine, which is why we developed the first Total Sleep Recovery product line to help you meet your fitness goals.\nLaunched in 2014, REM-Fit is an active lifestyle bedding brand that that helps you achieve a healthy and active lifestyle by getting the best sleep possible for maximum recovery and comfort. The REM-Fit product line consists of three product categories: The REST, the ENERGIZE and the MOTIVATE Collections.\nBy focusing on both activity and the sleep needed for recovery, REM-Fit Active is an exciting way for you, no matter what fitness level, to track your sleep and activity and contribute to living a healthy lifestyle.\nREM-Fit is a division of Protect-A-Bed, a company with over 35 years of experience in the sleep industry and more than 8000 stores across the country.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPILLOW COMFORT:\nA pillow is a very personal item and people have different options on the ideal pillow. We have worked hard to make a pillow that will be very comfortable for all types of sleeping positions and firmness preferences.\n\nMAKING EVERYTHING WORK TOGETHER:\nThere are a lot of sensors and components inside of a very soft object. Not only must if feel great to sleep on, it has to work properly. The noise sensors must react properly; the vibration motors must be strong enough to be felt through the padding, but not overpowering. We had to write new algorithms and logic so that all of our various components worked in concert with each other easily and effectively. \n\nDECIBEL READING:\nHaving a microphone that can detect sound down to a specific decibel and then react properly is a key component. The microphone has to be cost effective, sensitive and accurate. This is not an easy feat!\n\nAPP LOGIC:\nWith all the information coming from the pillow, the app needs to not only read the raw data, but present it in a way that makes sense to the end user. Also, the app must be easy to use, which can be a challenge with all the features available to the user.\n\nMANUFACTURING:\nWe have already done all the heavy lifting: We have factories lined up, components sourced and functional prototypes created. However, we know that there can be unforeseen challenges between pre-production and production. It is not unheard of for a factory to change hands or a component to fail in production. We are an established company with experience and relationships, which should minimize any manufacturing issues we might face.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "ZEEQ Supporter", "descp": "We appreciate support at any pledge level.

Tell your friends too!!\nWi-Fi and Bluetooth are essential!\nThey are the most frequently used wireless technologies; we use them to access the internet, connect cordless keyboards and many more. However, Pi Zero and previous Raspberry Pi models do not have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth built-in.\nWhat is IoT HAT?\nIoT (Internet-of-Things)\nHAT (Hardware Attached on Top)\nIt is an add-on board that provides Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity for the Raspberry Pi.\nYou can use Wi-Fi and Bluetooth USB dongles, however .......\nIoT HAT is more affordable\nYou get both functions for the price of one dongle. And if you are using Pi Zero, you may also need to purchase:\nUSB OTG cable ($3-$5) - connect a normal USB device to the Pi Zero's micro USB port.\nUSB hub with power adapter ($15-$30) - if you need to connect more than one USB device, it is advisable to use a powered hub for your Wi-Fi and/or USB Bluetooth dongle(s). \nThe setup is more orderly\nBecause you do not need the USB OTG Cable and the USB Hub etc, the setup is faster and looks less cluttered.\nIf you are running an IoT project, you could also remove the keyboard and mouse.\nIoT HAT has the same wireless radio as the Pi 3\nWe are using the same BCM43438 chip that is on the Pi 3 (read here) which supports both Wi-Fi 802.11n (2.4GHz) + Bluetooth 4.1 (Dual Mode \u2013 Classic and Bluetooth Low Energy) running at the same time.\nThe wireless radio of IoT HAT is as good as that of the Pi 3 and all WiFi/Bluetooth software for Pi 3 are compatible.\nRead the full blog post\nYou can extend the RF range easily\nThe IoT HAT has an on-board antenna. However if you want to increase the RF range, you can simply attach a compatible antenna to the external antenna socket and flip a switch. No hacking or soldering is required.\nBoth Wi-Fi and Bluetooth operate on the same 2.4GHz frequency, they share the on-board antenna or an external antenna when running.\nPi Zero + IoT HAT is the best IoT combo\nNot only is the combination the cheapest of all the options, it has also has the lowest power consumption!\nOur partners\nYou can connect to your Pi over the Internet easily with Weaved's IoT Kit for the Raspberry Pi. We are working closely with their engineers to ensure our HAT supports all their services.\nOur friends at 8Bitdo have made a special edition of their popular ZERO GamePad for this campaign.\nThe recalbox allows you to replay a variety of video game consoles and platforms, in your living room, with ease! The recalboxOS is free and open source. \nLive demos\nRunning Wi-Fi sockets and controlling 8 BLE devices at the same time.\n- Pi Zero + IoT HAT running a Nodejs socket server with Sandeep Mistry\u2019s noble BLE library \n- BLE Nano running BLE Peripheral firmware developed on mbed platform\nMore details about this demo is available on the this post.\nPLAY\n\nRunning Raspbian desktop with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.\nPLAY\n\nMedia Center - Kodi on recalbox.\nPLAY\n\nBattle with your friends in your favorite retro games.\nPLAY\n\nTechnical details\nLayout\nDimensions\nIoT HAT is designed to fit perfectly on the Pi Zero, measuring 65 x 30 mm.\nAnd it is also compatible with all previous Pi models with the 40-pins connector including Pi 2, model A+ and B+.\nPinout\nAfter connecting the IoT HAT, there are 11 GPIO pins left for you to use.\nRewards\nWe offer the IoT HAT, the RedBear ZERO GamePad and the Antenna Kit (antenna with interface cable) as rewards.\nIoT HAT is shipped with a 2x20 female header soldered.\nYou can choose not to have the header soldered when you fill in the survey form and we will include the header in your shipment. You can mix these options if you order more than one HAT.\nIf you're interested in getting more of an item, or creating a combination not listed in the rewards section, simply add the extra corresponding costs to your total pledge amount:\nIoT HAT - add $9 each \nAntenna Kit - add $6 each\nRedBear ZERO GamePad - add $10 each\nShipping & delivery\nWe are keeping this very simple and affordable; we will ship any quantity, anywhere in the world for $5! That\u2019s right, any quantity!\nAfter the campaign has ended, we will send you a survey form to fill in the delivery, contact information, IoT HAT choice (with/without header) and extra item(s) you have pledged.

ThreadStax streamlines the daily process of folding, storing and selecting your outfits so you save time, maximize space and can focus on the important things in life.\nThreadStax is a closet organizing solution that folds and stacks shirts, jeans, pants, and other garments in a neat, impossible-to-disturb stacks. Utilizing the power of magnets, ThreadStax keeps your closet and drawers looking sharp and easy to navigate. Just enough magnetism to keep the stack in place, while allowing you to flip through and select your clothes with a gentle tug. Air vents allow clothes to breathe, and spacers not only provide support to the stack, but keep delicate items from being crushed underneath your other items.\nSlides\n At the heart of the system are slides that separate your clothes. They can be used to separate single items or entire outfits. Featuring magnets to keep everything in order when you\u2019re searching through your wardrobe.\nBrackets\n Brackets are easy to install and remove thanks to Command\u2122 strips. They adhere to any surface and remove without damage. Watch this 16 second video for a demo.\nThe Brackets come in two sizes, 4 and 6 inch (10cm and 15.25cm).

Whether it\u2019s rifling to find that one shirt or trying to pull something from the bottom of the shelf, it\u2019s inevitable. It made us ask:\n In a poll we took, over half the population has clean clothes cluttering their homes. 90% of which admitted feeling demotivated to fold their clothes at all because they never stay that way.

All of our backers will be given an account at RLFPS.com which gives you access to behind the scenes and voting rights in pre-production, and the opportunity to join the community in controlling the interactive live prologue to Level 3. Furthermore, rather than finding players on ChatRoulette, our 50 final players for Level 3 will be randomly selected from our backers! \nWe're crowdfunding here on Kickstarter, and on our own website to raise the funds to create Level 3.

Then it struck us - through crowdfunding we have found a way to keep it on YouTube, keep it free to watch AND allow people to play. So, starting with Level 3, it\u2019s no longer a prank on the internet, it\u2019s no longer random strangers on ChatRoulette - we are going to build a community.\nYour \u00a31 pledge won\u2019t just give you the chance to be chosen to play Level 3, it will also give you access to an account at RLFPS.com where you can become part of our creative community, with exclusive behind the scenes access, and voting rights on pre-production.\nYou\u2019ll get to collectively choose anything from character names, to costume designs, to setpieces - when our props team come up with designs for a new weapon, you will be able to vote on which design goes into production and gets built!\nYou all come together for a massive playable live stream of the prologue to Level 3 - this is where it gets really cool\u2026\nFrom Level 3 onwards we are doing away with the genre-hopping and creating a consistent universe - so you will follow the characters and the plot across multiple levels of the game. The story picks up right where we left off in Level 2 - with you and the other survivor piloting the escape pod.\nThe prologue for Level 3 will be broadcast live, and controlled by the voting of all of our backers simultaneously, just like \u2018Twitch does Pokemon\u2019 - except with the actors reacting live to the results of all of your choices. You\u2019re in charge of staying alive, and trying to find somewhere to land the escape pod - all of your decisions will have repercussions that will echo across Level 3 and way beyond.\nOnce the prologue is finished, it\u2019s time for us to start playing the full level - and instead of going to ChatRoulette this time, we\u2019ll be selecting 50 players, at random, from all of our backers. Each of the chosen players will play through the five chapters of Level 3 - as long as they make it through alive\u2026\nIf you aren\u2019t picked for the full game, you\u2019ll still be able to watch the events unfold.

If you are rooting for one of the players, or perhaps you even know one of them, gifting them a token when they need it most will give them a game specific boost and help them along.\nIf you choose to donate more than \u00a31, your name will be entered into the hat multiple times, increasing your chances of being chosen to play Level 3, but no matter what your donation amount you will have access to all of the exclusive online content.\nCan't use Kickstarter?

Here is what we can say\u2026.\nNo more genre-hopping from zombies to aliens and so on - we now have an opportunity to invite you into a vivid, consistent universe with characters and storylines that span multiple installments. We anticipate that the full game will take up to one hour to complete per player, broken up into shorter chapters, probably five 12 minute sections.\nNow that the end goal isn\u2019t a YouTube viral film, the gameplay can slow right down to give you a chance to really explore the world and your options. There will be a heavy focus on interacting directly with other characters and actors in the game, rather than just talking to the guy in the helmet. If you have a great idea for how to solve a problem, convince them to help you.\nBudget allowing, there will be much more interaction that just voice - there are so many new things being developed here, it will leave Levels 1 and 2 in the dust.\nThe team here are more fired up than they have been in years - and we are ready to deliver a rich, living world for you to explore and interact with. We have the best Artificial Intelligence in the industry - because it\u2019s not artificial - there are a dozen real people reacting to each of your decisions in as you make them.\nUltimately the world we can build for you in Level 3 is determined by the number of backers - but trust us when we say, there is a $10m version of Level 3 that would change the face of gaming. The sky really is the limit, and of course anything we don\u2019t get to do with Level 3 will be carried over to Level 4 and beyond.\nRealm is about breaking the rules, and combining cinematic production value with high-concepts on a low budget. It's the unforgettable ideas and stories that get us out of bed in the mornings, and the resourcefulness we have picked up over a decade of indie filmmaking that allows us to pull it all off.\n From the moment we came up with the concept for Level 1, it was clear that our friends at Red House Mysteries would be the perfect collaborators for the RLFPS concept.

The language of our eyes is one of the most powerful and effective tools of non-verbal communication.\nEye expressions are an efficient, natural and universal way to connect instantly with Ulo.\nExclusive discounts are only available for Kickstarter backers. \nA - 2 Round 1,22\u201c LCD screen (originally used for smartwatches)\nB - 1 Hidden surveillance camera (1080p HD / 30 fps) & Motion Sensor under the two-way mirror beak \nC - 1 Mono Microphone\nD - 1 Capacitive button\nE - 1 Neodymium magnet under the rotative base\nF - 4 Adhesive neodymium magnets (\u230020mm/\u23000.8in)\nG - 1 Wifi 802.11ac module\nH - 1 Orientation sensor\nI - 1 Li-Po rechargeable battery\nJ - 1 micro-USB to USB cable (65cm/25.6in)\nK - 1 Speaker\n Every Ulo will be upgraded with unlocked new features (no extra charges).\nPLAY\n\nUlo needs a working wifi network to be fully functional.\nUlo communicates through eye expressions. A webpage and mobile apps allows you to customize eyes color, shape and size to match your interior and your taste. No logos or icons are displayed on the screens, but you instantly know what Ulo has in mind. \nFor instance, when the battery is low (under 10%) Ulo is tired, \nUlo blinks when you take a snapshot, \nits eyes follow your movements and Ulo squints when someone is watching live video. \nRandom animations add that extra spark of life which makes Ulo unique.\nEye expressions are possible thanks to new round LCD screens originally manufactured for next-generation smartwatches.\nThis is an example of the default tap system. You can configure custom (and secret) sequences to trigger On/Off & Alert Mode functions.\nA double tap on Ulo forehead will activate the Alert Mode.\nOnce your smartphone leaves your wifi network, every movement will be recorded in an animated gif and sent via email.\nEye expressions are not displayed.\nWhen your smartphone (and thus yourself) reconnects to your wifi network, the alert mode is disengaged.\nIt is a very simple way to check what is going on in another room or when you\u2019re away. Ulo streams directly (video & audio) on a secure webpage or mobile apps. This feature is perfect to use Ulo as a baby cam.\nUlo captures snapshots on demand and sends it on a secure webpage, your dropbox account or directly on your email.\nInfrared night vision let Ulo see clearly in total darkness. \n Ulo can \"talk\" to you with customizable sounds.\nIn Alert Mode, Ulo can last one week on a full charge. In everyday use, with eye expressions, Ulo needs to be recharged every 2 days. Of course you can also leave Ulo plugged in all the time on a USB port.\nUlo can lay on a flat surface or be hanged on a wall. A set of discrete adhesive neodymium magnet allows you to stick Ulo on every surface effortlessly.\nUlo is now waterproof! \nThis means you can place Ulo outside, within a reasonable temperature range (-10\u00b0C/14\u00b0F to 50\u00b0C/122\u00b0F) \nUlo services are accessible on a webpage, so it is compatible with every device with an internet connection and a browser.\nDedicated mobile apps for iOS & Android:\nUlo is also compatible with IFTTT. It\u2019s the best way to extend its purpose.\nUlo functionalities can trigger or be triggered by other connected devices or internet services.\nFor example, here's my favorite recipes:\nBut other connected devices or internet services can trigger emotions in Ulo.\nFor example, weather can affect Ulo's mood:\nDifferent emotions will overlay Ulo's eye movements, here's the first list of animations available:\nHappy / Grumpy / Surprised / Upset / Agitated / Puzzled\nBlinks / Squint\nChange Eye color / Reflects / Size\nOther recipe ideas:\nIf there is a birthday on my calendar today, then Ulo is happy\nIf the pollen count rises above 6, then change Ulo eyes color to red\nIf you have an appointment, then Ulo is puzzled (You shouldn't be home)\n Ulo only stores a few minutes of video locally. Nothing is sent over a distant third party server.\nThink of Ulo as your own personal server, so there are no extra fees.\nThe owl only sends data to your secure devices when needed. Each device has its own password + a second step authentification.\nThe setup is easy, a QR code is generated when your device connects for the first time. You just have to show this code to Ulo.\nYou\u2019ll have to renew this operation every 6 months.\nA detailed user guide is included in the box and video tutorials will be available online.\nIn the future, Ulo internal software will evolve. \nI\u2019ll add more random animation to the default settings and new kind of styles will be available. \nExample: \nPixelArt\nHand drawn\nRealistic\n3D effects etc\u2026 \nDon\u2019t hesitate to share your feeling in the comment section, it will help me to pick up the most suggested.\n\nUlo by day\nChasing tail\nTired Ulo = battery under 10%\n If you are interested in distributing Ulo, please fill-out the form at the top of this page: \nhttp://vivien-muller.fr/ulo-infos \nI\u2019ll contact you as soon as the product is ready.\n                                                                                                                                            ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCreating a brand new product is a time consuming and very complex process. \n\nI estimate delivery to be late 2016.

Fortunately, we've have been working hard and have established relationships with manufacturing partners in the US that will help us bring Metawear to your doorstep.\n\nOf course, there are still risks associated with producing the Metawear board. Unexpected changes in component lead times, availability, and cost are examples of factors outside our direct control that could affect our delivery timeline, but we are working hard to mitigate those risks and plan to be transparent throughout the delivery process.\n\nThe other risk with this and any other project that involves physical delivery comes with shipping. There are a number of unforeseen circumstances that can cause problems during the actual physical shipping of the Metawear boards. We plan to work with proven companies to help ensure that MetaWear Coin arrives (in perfect condition) at their delivery destination.

Click here to visit our online store and buy merch after we ship our rewards to backers!\nOur Story\nThe Mk.II - a 12,000-pound, 15-foot-tall combat robot that needs upgrades for hand-to-hand combat.\nWe are MegaBots, Inc. We challenged Japan to a giant robot duel, and they accepted... but demanded that the fight include hand-to-hand combat. We say BRING IT ON. We've assembled an incredible team of patriots to help us upgrade the Mk.II into the robot America deserves in the world's first giant robot fight, but we need your support to help pay for those upgrades!\nThe upgraded Mk.II concept - the most American robot ever made.\nRight now, the existing Mk.II tops out at 2.5 mph and is built for long-range paintball combat. That means it has thin, destructible armor plates and a mesh canopy. The entire robot's built to be 'lightweight' (if you can call 12,000 pounds light), and hand-to-hand fighting is a whole new level of combat.\nIn order for the Mk.II to survive hand-to-hand combat, we need to\nAdd heavy duty armor plating\nAdd some serious firepower \nUpgrade our hydraulics to handle the heavier armor and firepower \nIncrease our top speed \nUpgrade our power unit to keep up with our new hydraulic system and speed \nThat basic upgrade will cost $500,000. In order to make sure we win the fight, we need to:\nTest a wide range of weapons and choose the best load-out\nKeep our balance during hand to hand combat and not fall over\nNot injure ourselves in the cockpit during combat\nFight with an incredibly sweet paint job. While not strictly required, this is a matter of national pride. \nAll told, a fully upgraded Mk.II will cost $1,500,000. \nTeam USA needs your help now, in order to win this fight. Pledge today to make sure your team takes home the trophy!\nRobot Upgrades\n$500,000: Melee Combat Capability, High Performance Track Base\nMeeting our $500,000 goal means that we get to seriously overhaul the Mk.II. We'll build the ridiculously cool weapon systems you see in our concept art, add the shock-mounted steel armor we need to survive multi-ton punches, beef up our hydraulic actuators to handle the additional weight of our armor and weapons, upgrade our power unit to provide 5x the horsepower to handle the additional power demands of our new hydraulic system, and then work with Howe & Howe Technologies to build a custom track base replacement that'll make us 5x faster than we are now - which will end up making us 2x faster than KURATAS!\n$750,000: Modular Melee & Ranged Weapon Options\nRaising $750,000 will allow us to design and build an array of melee and ranged weapon systems options to help us find the perfect load-out to beat KURATAS. This kind of fight has never happened in real life before - what works at this scale, and what doesn't? This level will help us answer that question. This assortment potentially includes, but isn't limited to, crushing and grasping claws, pile drivers, shields, pneumatically-driven fists, cannons of all shapes and sizes, and flamethrowers (just in case).\n$1,000,000: Dynamic Balancing Algorithm\nAt the end of the day, both the Mk.II and KURATAS are top-heavy. We can practice driving and punching carefully to make sure we don't fall, but right now both robots run the risk of tipping over if they punch or get punched too hard. Raising $1,000,000 will allow us to work with IHMC Robotics, the top-placed U.S. team in the DARPA Humanoid Robotics Challenge, to develop a custom high-end balance control system for the Mk.II so that we can stay upright no matter what happens. This system could EASILY make the difference between falling over after the first punch, and staying upright through the entire match.\n$1,250,000: Life Safety Systems\nRaising $1,250,000 will allow us to engage with NASA - the leaders in the field of keeping humans safe in extreme environments - to see how NASA life safety systems might be used in the cockpit of the Mk.II. We need make sure we can fight as aggressively as possible while also not blacking out from impacts. Safety 4th, folks.\n$1,500,000: Hollywood-Grade Paint Job\nRaising $1,500,000 will allow us to work with FonCo Creative Services to create a Hollywood-grade artistic look and feel to the robot's armor panels. This is America's first giant combat robot - it deserves to look like the million bucks it actually costs!\nWhat You Get  \n$5: Website Shout-out\nFirst and foremost, you get to tell all your friends that you did your patriotic duty to make sure that America snatches the title of World's Best Giant Robot Builders from the hands of the Japanese. How's that for a reward? For $5 we'll put your name on our website as an online memorial to your awesomeness.\n$10: Behind-the-Scenes Media Content and Sticker\n For $10, we'll set you up with a sweet MegaBots logo sticker to feed your vandalism habit, in addition to the shout-out. All backers contributing to this level or more will also get access to the behind the scenes build process via the documentary we're filming!\n$12/15: Pilot the Mk.II In Robocraft\nFor $12 and above, you'll get to own and pilot the Mk.II in Robocraft, a new free-to-play game by Freejam Games that allows you to build your own combat robots from scratch and take them out onto the field of battle! The $12 level is a digital-only level, and comes with your name on our website but doesn't come with a sticker. The $15 level comes with both the Mk.II in Robocraft and a sticker from the $10 level. Any levels above $12 automatically receive the Robocraft unlock code.\n$25: Most Patriotic Poster Ever Created\nThe Mk.II concept art poster\nFor $25 you'll also get a 18\" x 24\" concept art poster celebrating the creation of the most American robot ever made.\n$50: One MegaBots Shirt\nJoin Team USA and show off your home team pride with a crew shirt!\nOur Evolution of Man shirt\nOur SUPER AMERICAN shirt\nFor $50, you'll get to pick from one of three shirts - a crew shirt that shows off your home team pride, an Evolution of Man shirt that celebrates the escalation of combat over the millennia, or our SUPER AMERICAN shirt that confirms that yes, Kogoro Kurata, building something huge and sticking guns on it is, in fact, Super American.\nYou'll choose which shirt and what sizes you want after the campaign's over, in a survey we send to our backers.

The boxed kit will be a numbered collector's item, so get yours sooner rather than later!\n$250: Demo Day Experience\nCome see the robot and party with us!\nSwag is awesome - but seeing the robot in person is cooler. For $250, you can come to our demo day, see the robot show off its abilities in person, and throw down at a crazy San Francisco party with the founders of MegaBots.\n$750: VIP Demo Day\nYou, too, can hang out with the MegaBros 1-on-1!\n $750 gets you a VIP demo day experience where you ALSO get to sign the robot, take pictures of yourself inside it, and hang out with the robot and founders in a separate, exclusive event.\n$1000/$2,500/$5,000:  MegaBot Pilot/Weapons Testing\nSuit up and pilot the Mk.II!\nFinally, for the ultimate thrill seekers out there, you can suit up and pilot this beast of a robot. $1,000 gets you a ride in the robot as it drives through an obstacle course at top speed. If just riding in the robot isn't enough, $2,500 puts you in the gunner's seat on our shooting range - blow up mock-up KURATAS robots as we drive the robot through a combat simulation. And if that's not enough... $5,000 will put you in the gunner's seat in an exoskeleton that controls the arms and torso of the Mk.II. You get to use a car as a punching bag until the timer's up. On top of all of these experiences, you get the collector's edition swag and a VIP invitation to our demo day.\nYou must be 18 years of age or older by May of 2016 in order to suit up and pilot the robot, and rest assured that you'll have to sign a mile-long waiver that's full of 'YOU MIGHT DIE. NO, SERIOUSLY.'\n$10,000: Pit Crew Experience\nJoin the pit crew!\nLast, but certainly not least, up to 5 lucky people will get to join our pit crew for $10,000. Come along for the ride on the ultimate, once-in-a-lifetime, behind-the-scenes experience as we take this fight to Japan.\nAdvisers\nGrant Imahara, formerly of Mythbusters and Industrial Light & Magic, has joined forces with us to help us design our robot, bring the giant robot duel to the people, and help make giant robot combat a sport in any way he can!\nPeter Diamandis, founder of the X-Prize, is helping us figure out how we can push the state of the art in robotics by using our competition to drive innovation!\nTrey Roski and Greg Munson, founders of BattleBots, have joined up with us to help us figure out the best weapons and strategies for melee combat against KURATAS, and to help us figure out how we can turn this duel into a sport!\nSponsors\nAutodesk has sponsored us from the beginning, supported the creation of the Mk.II, and will be continuing to support us with design software and access to high-end manufacturing equipment throughout this challenge.

With your ideas, feedback, and our learnings, we made an improved coin cell version, which we are super excited to share with the community.\nUsing the user feedback from our first product, we've transformed and improved the original MetaWear platform in just about every way; the tiny form factor is now even smaller, power consumption has been reduced, and we've optimized it to run on a single coin cell battery that doesn't need to be replaced for months!\nSchedule Delivery\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've brought you MetaWear before and we will do it again. Our first campaign was not only successfully funded but it was delivered early!\n\nThere are always significant challenges in manufacturing and delivering any hardware product at scale. Fortunately, we've have been working hard and have established relationships with manufacturing partners in the US that will help us bring Metawear to your doorstep.\n\nOf course, there are still risks associated with producing the Metawear board. Unexpected changes in component lead times, availability, and cost are examples of factors outside our direct control that could affect our delivery timeline, but we are working hard to mitigate those risks and plan to be transparent throughout the delivery process.\n\nThe other risk with this and any other project that involves physical delivery comes with shipping. There are a number of unforeseen circumstances that can cause problems during the actual physical shipping of the Metawear boards. We plan to work with proven companies to help ensure that MetaWear Coin arrives (in perfect condition) at their delivery destination. Since unforeseen circumstances can sometimes impact the shipping world, we will also make sure to have methods/resources in place to overcome any difficulties.\n\nPlease note that the final look and features of the MetaWear Coin are subject to change based on your feedback and circumstances outside of our control such as component availability.\n\nAs always we expect our backers, supporters, and MetaWear users to comply with the proper regulations and laws.

Setting your Sensorwake is as easy as setting your espresso machine, and changing out the scents is even faster. All this is brought to you by Guillaume Rolland, an 18-year-old French entrepreneur with a vision of making everyone wake up happy!\nEven Google recognizes SensorWake\u2019s potential, awarding it as one of the top 15 inventions \u201cthat can change the world\u201d at the 2014 Google Science Fair.We believe that everyone should wake up happy, relaxed and peaceful, empowered for adventures to come. Happiness lies in the little things, like a great morning, a smell we like, a memory it recalls, a smile it evokes... Together let\u2019s make sure this happens every day!\nOur story began on an early morning over a year ago when 17-year-old Guillaume Rolland couldn\u2019t wake up once again. He hated his noisy alarm clock so much that he decided then and there that he should do something about it.\nOne year later, Guillaume stood in Mountain View where his garage-built prototype placed in the Top 15 \u201cinventions that can change the world\u201d at the 2014 Google Science Fair.\nSince then, Guillaume has assembled a great team of talented and passionate people to make that change a reality. Now 18, and still a part-time engineering student at UTC, Guillaume heads the team and works nightly to achieve his goal of revolutionizing our mornings.\n\"I thought that now, in the 21st century, everyone should have the right to wake up happy, relaxed and peaceful, ready for a great day. So I invented the SensorWake!\" says Guillaume.\nWith the team assembled and partners in place ready to handle the operations, a successful Kickstarter is all Guillaume needs to allow everyone to share the SensorWake experience.\nBorn and raised in France, we grew up with quality smells all around us. That is why we are now happy to work with Givaudan, the world leader in fragrances and flavors. In fact, we\u2019re the first startup they\u2019ve ever chosen to work with.\n\u201cWe are used to working with household brands. But SensorWake represents a great challenge for us. We\u2019ve never done scented capsules for an olfactory alarm clock before!\u201d explains Aur\u00e9lie from Givaudan. \u201cWe truly believe in Guillaume\u2019s product and team. It\u2019s going to change the way we wake up.\u201d\nBut because we know that everyone is unique, we wanted to make sure you have a wide range of scents you can choose from, even at this early stage. As our backers, you\u2019ll be able to choose one of the following two-capsules packs (or more, depending on your pledge). One capsule wakes you up 60 times.\nHere are the two-capsules packs available:\n[NEW] American breakfast: Bacon & Freshly Squeezed Orange Juice\nContinental breakfast: Espresso & Hot Croissant\nCandy Rush: Sweet peach & Strawberry candy \nEnjoy the break: Seaside (monoi, tiare flower) & Lush Jungle (cut grass, leaves)\nInvigorating Aromatherapy: Purifying Tea Tree & Harmonious Chocolate \nVitalization Aromatherapy: Stimulating Ginger & Invigorating Pepper Mint \nVIP lounge (for Kickstarter Backers only): Dollar & Ebony Luxury\nThe patented SensorWake technology releases a scent that\u2019s dosed just right, thanks to its innovative diffusion system. In fact, according to consumer tests we ran on over 100 people, SensorWake will wake you up in under 2 minutes, 99% of the time!\nAnd for the 1% with a stuffy nose, SensorWake includes an audio alarm that goes off after 3 minutes if you\u2019re not awake. That way, you\u2019re never late\u2026 well, at least not because of us!\nSensorWake might sound like a device, but we like to think it\u2019s more. It\u2019s about making your mornings peaceful and happy, and your days smoother and easier to conquer.\nIt took countless hours to bring SensorWake to where it is now, from an original idea to an award-winning product with partnerships around the globe. But we\u2019ve still got a little ways to go. Landing SensorWake on your nightstand will take manufacturing and distribution startup costs, capital for our initial inventory, and additional quality assurance to make sure we\u2019re sending you the best product possible.\nWant to be part of our community? Check out the Backer rewards we developed to make sure you get a fantastic SensorWake experience for your contributions:\nIf you choose to back us, take a look at the table above to see what rewards you can get. You will be invited to choose your packs at the end of the Kickstarter campaign.\nAfter the launch, you\u2019ll be able to order refills and new capsules on our online store for an estimated $9 each. We\u2019re also doing our best to bring capsules to your favorite local store, so you won\u2019t have to wait for the mailman if you run out.\nTo make your life easier, we plan on setting up our website so you can register to get your favorite sent automatically delivered to your home once every two months. For the nappers out there, you\u2019ll be able to adjust this timing if you use capsules more often.\nYes! Easier to use than your coffee maker, setting up your SensorWake takes just three quick steps:\nAfter setting up the wake up time, insert the scent of your choice.\n Scent diffusion begins at the scheduled time.\nYou will be gently woken up within 2 minutes.\nScent refills are perfectly healthy: they are solvent-free, compliant with IFRA (International Fragrance Association, no allergen), REACH (European Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals Regulation, no chemical risks) and CARB standards (California Air Resource Board, healthy air quality).\nAt SensorWake we wanted to make a great device, not only for you, but also for our planet. That\u2019s why we designed it to be durable with high-quality materials to keep them out of landfills. Capsules are also 100% recyclable and free of any VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds).\nFinally, SensorWake fragrances leave no residue whatsoever on surfaces, clothes, or anything else in your room.\nOur team is a mix of youth, creativity, and excellence in engineering. We have experts in several fields, including engineering, marketing and design, and work closely with experts in olfaction and manufacturing, all ready to deliver the best product we can in a reasonable amount of time.\nWe are very proud that our invention has already received awards from prestigious institutions, which inspire us each day to go further.\nWe have tested and built SensorWake so that it\u2019s efficient, safe, and easy to use.

Therefore it works with all programs and webpages, because all programs and webpages take keyboard and mouse input.\nWhat Objects Does it Work With?\nMost materials that can conduct at least a tiny bit of electricity will work. Here are some materials people have used in our workshops: Leaves, aluminum foil, cars, running garden hose, silverware, milk, wet things, alive things, metallic things, graphite, play dough, kitchen sinks, etc. If something won't work, you can make it work for example by applying copper tape or getting them wet.\nFruits, Snacks, Humans, Animals, Cars, Swimming Pools, Coins, and Your Grandma, and Thousands More\nWhat Apps/Webpages Does it Work With?\nIt literally works with any app and any webpage that use a mouse or a keyboard press, which is almost every app or webpage a laptop can run. it just presses keyboard buttons and clicks the mouse. You might try a one button game website, or a music website such as TouchPianist. Use Photobooth or an online webcam program to trigger selfies, and use Powerpoint to advance slides. Launch Skype or FaceTime and hover the mouse arrow over the \"call\" button. Cue up a video on YouTube and trigger it to play with the spacebar or the mouse click. Or use one of the many custom Apps that we have created for you. There are countless possibilities.\nWho is Makey Makey GO For?\nArtists, Kids, Educators, Engineers, Designers, Inventors, Makers, Special Needs Children, Tinkerers, Creators, Dreamers\u2026 Really it is for everyone.\nAge 6 to 101, Kids and Teens Love Makey Makey, but so do Hobbyists and Experts\nWhile Makey Makey GO is playful and easy to use, it packs a lot of power and has a sleek technical design that geeks love.\nRequirements?\nMakey Makey GO works with any laptop or computer with a USB port and a recent operating system. How recent? We have tried it with Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7 & 8, and Mac OSX. It also works with some tablets and mobile devices.\nMakey Makey GO Plugged into a MacBook Pro. By hooking up the traditional pinball machine button to the Makey Makey GO you can play two pinball games at once.\nMakey Makey GO plugged into a Windows Surface tablet running Windows 8. The score counts how long the person has stayed on the slackline.\nMakey Makey GO plugged into a Samsung Galaxy running Android using a USB adapter. Cardboard SmartSword is made with a Smartphone, some aluminum foil, and Makey Makey GO. When the sword touches your \"enemy\" you get a point.\nReward Details\nMain Reward: Makey Makey GO Kit\n1 Makey Makey GO - Plug and Play, no assembly, no setup. \n1 beautiful Red Alligator Clip\n1 key ring\nSome stickers\nPrinted instructions with quickstart guide\nOnline apps and documentation\nBonus Rewards\nCollector's Tin - A medium sized red storage tin with Makey Makey designs and logos ($5 value)\nExpansion Pack - Spool of copper tape, extra long alligator clip, long extension wire ($10 value)\nT-Shirt - A High Quality American Apparel Makey Makey T-Shirt ($15 value)\nMakey Makey Classic - The original Makey Makey that started it all ($50 value)\nWhy Did You Create Makey Makey GO?\nWe believe that everyone is creative, inventive, and imaginative. We believe that everyone can create the future and change the world. We believe that the whole world is a construction kit, if we choose to see it that way. So we have dedicated our lives to making easy-to-use invention kits.\nWe redesigned Makey Makey Classic to focus it down to its absolute bare essentials: a single capacitive sensor input with a single alligator clip that can pretend to be any key or a mouse click. Then we gave it a magnet, a keyring, and shrunk it down so small that it fits anywhere. The result is something that can always GO with you and that is unbelievably simple to use. It's the size of a USB thumb drive and just as easy to plug and play. \nWe designed Makey Makey GO to feel more like a kitchen gadget or a multi-tool and less like a traditional circuit.\nMakey Makey GO stuck to a fridge door magnetically is just one example of how Makey Makey GO is always within grasp.\nMakey Makey Classic \nIn 2012 we created, Kickstarted and delivered (early) the original Makey Makey, and it was named Best of Kickstarter. It has now gone into the hands of 200,000 inventors and delighted millions of others.\nMakey Makey Awards and Press\nThe Makey Makey Classic was named one of Consumer Reports\u2019 \u201cBest Tech Toys of 2014\u201d and one of Popular Science's \u201cBest of Toy Fair (2014).\u201d In addition, Makey Makey Classic was recently inducted into the Museum of Modern Art\u2019s (MoMA) permanent collection.\nTED Talk on Makey Makey \n\"I used to want to design a utopic society, or a perfect world or something like that. But as I'm getting older I'm realizing that my idea of a perfect world really can't be designed by one person or even by a million experts. It's really going to be 7 billion pairs of hands, each following their own passions, and each kind of like a mosaic, coming up and creating this world in their backyards and in their kitchens. And that's a world I really want to live in.\"\nWho are we?\nTodd Eddie, Jay Silver, David ten Have, and Rachel Silver.\nJay Silver leads JoyLabz and recently came out of MIT Media Lab and Intel. Dave ten Have, COO, co-founded the first cloud 3D printing company, Ponoko, and is an awesome Hacker. Todd Eddie, our VP, is a climber, and he's a Georgia Tech electrical engineer. Rachel Silver, our Logistics Goddess, studied visual arts at Sarah Lawrence and Reed College and is a gardening guru. Liam Nilsen, who is a lifelong unschooler, joined most recently to handle social media \u2014 he also runs the Endor project. \nWe all collaborated from across the globe to bring Makey Makey GO into existence. As Dave said the day before launching the Kickstarter, \"I think I just realized that I am living in the future. I live in New Zealand, but here I am in Cocoa Beach riding an electric bamboo/carbon-fiber bike, made by a friend out of local bamboo and left over carbon fiber, to UPS to overnight prototypes of an invention kit the size of my thumb that didn't even exist until 2 weeks ago to people all over the world. I am my childhood self's superhero.\"\nSo many people contributed to Makey Makey GO that they can't all be listed here. Please see the about page for credits. Eric Rosenbaum co-invented Makey Makey Classic with Jay. Makey Makey would not be possible without the input of literally thousands of people.

However, the reality is that we are more dependent on audio jacks for our computers, phones and tablets than ever before.  We use this technology everywhere we go, and the unfortunate fact is that the audio jack has not stayed up-to-date to the demands placed on it today.\nThis dilemma is the \"spark\" that got it all started as we (Jon and Jeff) sat down over a cup of coffee...\n... dreaming of what the world might look like with an improved audio connection solution. That is where our passion started and it has only grown as we get closer to making our dream a reality.\nOur hope is that in some small way, you will be excited about this Kickstarter campaign, and you will believe in this vision and decide to join the MAGZET revolution. And if you do decide to join us, you will be the proud owner of a MAGZET before it land in stores! This is especially important for our backers in countries outside of the United States that may not always have immediate access to the new technologies \u2013 with your backing you will get the MAGZET at the same time as everyone else.\nReported by:\n                              Our Solution\nYes! MAGZET will bring innovation to the audio connection with the power of magnetic technology\u2026\nThe MAGZET Magnetic Technology in the Middle\nThink about it, if we add magnetic technology in the middle (and we did with the MAGZET!), we can keep all the accessories and devices and that we already invested in and make them...\nMAGkap and MAGjack\n\"Snap\" connect enabled \u2013 The magnet technology conveniently pulls them together in a \u201csnap\u201d and auto-aligns even in dark environments without specific visual focus.\nMore reliable \u2013 Once the MAGkap (the side you plug into the audio cable) and MAGjack (the side you plug into the device) is installed, the device\u2019s jack and your audio cable are protected from wear-out.\nSafer \u2013 The magnetic technology breakaway feature protects your ears, headphones, accessories, or even worse, your device from being catapulted into hard surfaces with very expensive and inconvenient consequences.\nWhat's so wrong with the traditional audio jack?\nWe have all experienced the flaws of the audio jack as we know it today...\nInconvenient - We have to \u201cvisually\u201d focus and locate a small hole to slide things together, which is difficult to do while driving or in certain situations such as in a dark room, or while device is in a handbag or backpack.\nFragile - The audio plug has been known to breakoff in a device\u2019s jack and/or the device\u2019s audio jack or cable as been known to wear-out and stop working.\nCostly/Painful - Pull on the audio or headset cable from a bad angle and devices have been known to be catapulted into hard surfaces with very expensive and painful consequences to your devices, and your ears, head, or other body parts.\nOpen Jack - With the audio jack remaining open when headphones are not in use, dirt, debris, and moisture can work its way into the jack, impacting performance.\nWhere can I use it?\nConnecting to all your audio devices and accessories becomes simple and smooth. You can use your MAGZET with your phone, computer, tablet, headphones, stereo systems, even your car auxiliary input... pretty much any place you want an easier and safer way to connect your audio. You will want to have several, for maximum audio device and accessory versatility.\nWill all my current audio features still work? What about sound quality?\nYes! We took the design time and have run tests to make sure the MAGZET functions correctly with all your favorite devices, including Apple and Android-based models. You will still be able to answer calls, use the mic, adjust volume and skip tracks via the cable inline controls when using the MAGZET. The audio quality is preserved as we use the highest quality materials and manufacturing processes that one would expect from a high-end audio accessory.  Whether you\u2019re using your favorite phone, tablet, headphones, or computer, we have made sure that your device\u2019s functionality, audio quality, and features will continue to work just as you have always experienced with your wired solution.\nWhat about Bluetooth headsets?  Aren't they the future?\nThe apparent freedom of going wireless with Bluetooth seems like a nice option. However, it can be incredibly cumbersome to have to work through the pairing process and have a whole additional device that requires battery monitoring and charging. The MAGZET does not have these limitations, and it also works with devices that do not have Bluetooth functionality \u2013 all you need is that internationally ubiquitous audio jack that has been around for decades, well before Bluetooth was invented. If you need a wireless based solution there is certainly a place for Bluetooth, but it is not at some disadvantages and shortcomings compared to the wired audio quality and \"it just works\" convenience of the MAGZET.\nCan I really leave my MAGjack in all the time?\nYes, we wanted you to leave your MAGjack in so we invented a means to accomplish this! Normally when one plugs a connector into a phone audio jack, the phone (rightly so) thinks something is plugged in and would normally re-route the audio to headset functionality. Our technology counters the normal behavior and ensures that the MAGjack alone is not detected and the phone only detects the MAGjack when the MAGkap is connected.\nCan I really trust that you can build this thing?\nThis is certainly a fair question! The good news is that Jon is an award-winning technology innovator who has commercialized dozens of products with a deployment of over 5 million devices worldwide. Additionally, Jon has built-up a network of relationships over years of domestic and Far East business dealings and travels that will be leveraged on this project. \n\nAll this to say, you can be assured that the MAGZET will be built to a world-class quality level and that we have the experience, tenacity, and relationships to deliver what we promise.\nHOW YOUR BACKING DOLLARS WILL BE USED...\nThere are several tasks yet to be completed.  Please watch the following video to see how your backing dollars will make them possible.\nPLAY\n\nSo, that\u2019s where we stand. We have a fairly user-friendly prototype (as featured in the video). However, our design still needs to be miniaturized (made smaller), custom tooled, and ramped up in manufacturing.\nTHAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN!!!\nThese last steps are expensive, and we are asking YOU to please help us take MAGZET across the finish line. And in so doing... joining the MAGZET revolution of changing how the world plugs audio things together!\nHow do I back this campaign?\nBacking MAGZET on Kickstarter is simple and secure - and open to everyone around the world.\nLog into your Kickstarter account, or create a new account. \nClick the green \u201cBack This Project\u201d button at the top of this page. \nEnter your pledge amount and select one of the reward levels.

We have a long-term perspective, and the environment will remain a part of our decision-making paradigm.\n*** PLEASE KEEP SCROLLING FOR A DEEPER DIVE INTO DESIGN/RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ***\nDesigned with a \"Simplicity\" Focus\nIf there is one word that sums up the MAGZET \u2013 it would be simplicity. On the outside, the Series1 looks clean and simple, and the user experience is just as easy... just \"snap\" the MAGkap and MAGjack together, and you are off and running \u2013 i.e. it just works!  However, the most simplistic of user experiences is realized by a level of \"sophistication under the covers,\" which we will continue to dive into with the next section.\n\"Simplicity\" the Ultimate Sophistication\nResearch and Development\nAs in any entrepreneurial invention, the idea is the easy part; the hard part is the actual realization of that idea into a tangible solution that people would really find valuable and be willing to purchase.\nSo, we got to work over a year ago, pulling off many late nights. We researched by tearing into numerous devices, including Apple and Android based models.  We analyzed various magnetic strengths and tested early prototype concepts, improving each design iteration, with a plugfest with real people and devices.\nHere is just a small snapshot of the work we have completed from a Research and Development perspective, to give you a taste of what we have been up to.\nThe MAGkap and MAGjack\nBoth the MAGkap and MAGjack are designed for easy use and consist of quality components to make sure you experience the high fidelity sounds you expect from a great audio accessory.  \n\"We designed to the standards of a product we would be thrilled to use in our own daily lives.\"  \nThe design gives you a 360 degree solid connection, while still having the added benefit of magnetic breakaway protection.  The graphic below cycles through several of the MAGkap and MAGjack design iterations we explored through the design process.\nEngineering and Testing\nWhen we said we literally tore into jacks we were serious!  The graphics below shows 10 very popular devices\u2019 audio jacks from several vendors that we analyzed by cross-sectional cutout (by hand filing!) to determine their inner workings.\nThe analysis was key in determining a (patent pending) means to overcome the challenge that when one plugs a connector into a phone audio jack, the phone (rightly so) thinks something is plugged in and would normally re-route the audio to headset functionality, even if the MAGkap was not installed.\n\"We want you to leave your MAGjack in and needed to invent a means to achieve that - which we did!\"\nMagnetic Strength\nAs one would expect, a product based on magnetic technology required considerable magnetic analysis and design effort. We needed to determine the optimal magnetic strength for both holding under normal use and for the magnetic breakaway protection features.  \n\"It took us months to zero into the optimal magnetic strength after testing dozens of magnetic materials and shapes.\"  \nThe fun video below illustrates the magnetic holding force on the prototype concept shown above.\nPLAY\n\nNote: The video\u2019s audio track is that of our co-founder (Jeff) showing off his mad electric guitar skills!\nLatest Prototype\nThe latest prototype is shown in the graphic below. It has yet to be miniaturized (made smaller) and does not display the final color scheme. The prototype was rapid-prototyped through the use of 3D metal printing and CNC machining processes and was hand assembled.\nOUR STORY\nAfter spending the last 15 years working in the IT Industry, I (Jeff) left my job looking to do something different. One day, I was sitting in a local coffee shop and ran into a friend of mine named Jon Hallsten. Jon was closing one chapter of his career and was considering starting a new innovative product design company. We started talking about coming up with a gadget idea that we could take to market and had mass market appeal.\nThat's how the concept of the MAGZET product got started. Being a guitar player for the last 40 years, I mentioned that it seems crazy that we still plug things in and out to connect to devices, i.e. guitar amps, headphones, etc. Jon agreed, and that\u2019s what got us working on the product!\nSpecial Thanks to: Raymond Bugelski, Steve Chiles, Rodney Ross, John Buchanan, Paul Evans, Adam Rissmiller, Matt Orley, Shane Sevo, Scott Foster, Bob Martinez, Jay Yoo, Jon Fawcett, Kyle Crocker, Ken Burns, Vince Fisher and Zach Beaver for their expertise in support of this project.  All the talented people at Orca for all their hard work and design assistance.  All the trailblazing entrepreneurs on Kickstarter, whose campaigns we watched and learned from.  And most importantly, we are so grateful to our beautiful wives, Denise Hallsten and Lisa Russell, for putting up with our long nights and for their support of our dream.  We are humbled that you believe in our mission and are confident that together we can make MAGZET a reality and ultimately change how the world plugs audio things together!  Again, thanks to all of you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur biggest technical challenge to overcome was the fact that when one plugs a connector into a phone's audio jack, the phone thinks something is plugged in and re-routes the audio to headset functionality. The good news is that we invented (patent pending) a solution to fix that problem when just the MAGjack is installed and the Series1 does not have this shortcoming.\n\nTechnical Risk\n\nHowever, our technical challenges are far from over. We all know the benefits of miniaturization. This will be especially important in a MAGjack design that is intended to be left in a device. We want to shrink the MAGZET so that it protrudes less, and has room for the magnet (with enough strength), the landing pad, and the inter-connect contact points required. Definitely a design trade off!\n\nAnother significant challenge we have is that the nature of our design requires numerous, very intricate sub-pieces, which are hard to manufacture and require expensive tooling. We must not only shrink the design, but reduce its complexity and ensure that it can be reliably manufactured over volume! That is not easy...\n\nIn light of the challenges above, our timeline could be affected if we cannot solve them in a timely manner. Should we miss our technical deadlines, we\u2019ll let you know why (per Backer Promise #2) and make it right as quickly as possible.\n\nForecasting Risk\n\nOnce we get a flavor for the popularity of our campaign, we will do our best to forecast demand and create a solid production plan timeline. We've learned a lot from our years of bringing products to market, but sometimes, despite our best intentions, forecasts don\u2019t always hit the mark. Should we miss our projections, we\u2019ll let you know why (per Backer Promise #2) and take corrective action immediately.\n\nSupply Chain Risk\n\nWe\u2019ve built a network of manufacturing relationships with very capable teams over the years of building products. However, component delays and unexpected shortages can occur. If this happens, we\u2019ll be sure to keep you informed (per Backer Promise #2) and work to quickly solve the problem.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nWhile every attempt was made in this campaign to use final design intent representations, we realize that during the miniaturization and build out process the MAGZET may have to be slightly altered in appearance and/or performance. We reserve the ability in good faith to make these changes if needed.\n\n*** Bottom Line *** \n\nWe know what it will take to bring the MAGZET to market, just as we have with numerous other products (actually over 5 million shipped devices worldwide) through the course of our careers. We have the experience, tenacity, and relationships to deliver what we promise.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "MAGZET - Jon Hallsten & Jeff Russell\nFirst created \u00b7 19 backed\nHi All, We are Jeff Russell and Jon Hallsten and we live in the Akron, Ohio area.
