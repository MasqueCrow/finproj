So, it\u2019s time to move the goalposts: Let\u2019s raise $350,000 and we'll build a screening room !!!\nMovie Madness is a Portland institution. Known for its vast collection, knowledgeable staff, and display cases full of legendary film props, the iconic Belmont storefront has a deserved reputation as one of the best video stores in the country.\nBut now Movie Madness is in danger of closing forever. The Hollywood Theatre has the chance to purchase Movie Madness and fold it into our nonprofit, ensuring that this invaluable collection remains available to Oregonians for years to come. We must raise $250,000 by November 10 or Movie Madness will close and the collection will be sold.\nWith your help, we can save this important piece of Portland\u2019s culture and ensure its collection of 80,000+ titles remains accessible to movie lovers everywhere.\nMovie Madness was founded in 1991 by Mike Clark. Mike is now ready to retire - and he\u2019s offered the Hollywood Theatre the chance to acquire his beloved business for $250,000. (The collection alone was recently appraised at $585,000.)\nIf we succeed in raising our goal, the Hollywood Theatre will buy Movie Madness - the business and the 80,000+ title collection - and transition it into our nonprofit. We will continue to rent the Belmont storefront for the foreseeable future, and Mike will continue to display his remarkable collection of film props in the store\u2019s film museum. We will also retain the store\u2019s current employees.\nThe Hollywood is the right organization to buy Movie Madness and ensure its long-term survival. We\u2019ve lovingly restored our 1926 movie palace, and opened our new microcinema at Portland International Airport. We brought 70mm film presentation back to Portland. And we\u2019re a thriving nonprofit with 3,200+ members who believe in our mission of preserving and promoting the art of film.\nBy acquiring Movie Madness, we\u2019re not trying to save a dying business model - we\u2019re going to help it evolve by rethinking the role it plays in the community.\nWe\u2019ll expand our popular membership program to include benefits at Movie Madness. \nWe\u2019ll explore community engagement opportunities through construction of a new screening room and the development of new partnerships. \nWe\u2019ll partner with Free Geek to provide affordable access to VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray players. \nWe\u2019ll continue to preserve and grow the collection, adding new releases and found treasures to ensure that Movie Madness remains a \u201cliving collection\u201d that reflects the diverse interests and perspectives of the community it serves.\nWe\u2019ve already secured a $90,000 grant from the James F. and Marion L. Miller Foundation to provide two years of operating support for the project, contingent on this campaign succeeding. We are prepared to invest time, energy, and money into this project to ensure the long-term viability of Movie Madness.\nThe single most important reason for acquiring Movie Madness is to keep its extensive collection accessible to the public. A collection of this size is an irreplaceable cultural resource.\nThere are 80,000+ titles in the Movie Madness collection. In 2016, according to Variety, Amazon had 18,405 movies and 1,981 TV shows; Netflix had 4,563 movies and 2,445 TV shows; and Hulu had 6,656 films and 3,588 television shows. (Read more about Netflix\u2019s \u201cabominable selection of classic cinema\u201d in this recent Newsweek article.) Movie Madness has twice as many titles available as all three platforms combined.\nStreaming services offer only the illusion of choice. In reality, their constantly shifting lineup is dictated by studio licenses and distributor contracts, with titles subject to vanishing without notice.\nAdditionally, plenty of movies never make it to these services in the first place. Whenever there is an industry transition to a new format, movies are left behind - obscure and cult titles rarely make the cut.\nThese movies are not just entertainment - they represent diverse perspectives in a time when diverse voices are sorely needed in public discourse, and provide snapshots into our cultural history that can enlighten our present. By acquiring the Movie Madness collection, we\u2019ll keep these titles available to the public, and we\u2019ll make sure that the rare and one-of-a-kind titles in the collection are preserved.\nPledge today, and help us keep this irreplaceable community resource alive.\nWe're excited to offer some unique rewards in return for your support!\nFor $25, you can get your hands on a wool felt pennant in either the Movie Madness or Hollywood Theatre design. For $35, we've got some beautiful enamel pins, designed exclusively for this Kickstarter project. For $40, you can wear your support with pride with our Movie Madness \u201cVHS\u201d tee, and for $50, our glow-in-the-dark \"Frankie\" tee.\nNew! For $75, we\u2019re offering a limited-edition 18\u201dx24\u201d screenprinted poster, featuring prominent films from the Movie Madness collection and plenty of easter eggs for Movie Madness fans. Illustrated by Jolby & Friends and printed by Seizure Palace.\nFor $80, you\u2019ll get two tickets to A Night With Todd Haynes, an exclusive double feature of BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS and a newly restored, doll-themed rarity (the title of which we\u2019re not at liberty to mention). Both films will be presented in 35mm and the evening will be hosted by director Todd Haynes! We\u2019ll even throw in popcorn and two beverages per person.\nWe're also excited to offer new ways for our community to get involved with Movie Madness. For $100, you can select a film from their 80,000+ collection to be sponsored indefinitely under a name of your choosing (availability permitting). For $150, choose five movies to be featured in Movie Madness\u2019 Community Picks section - with recommendations provided by you. Your picks will be featured for one month.\nNew! For $400, we'll screen your favorite film from the Movie Madness collection in our *new* screening room! Once we finish construction, you\u2019ll be among the first to enjoy Southeast Portland\u2019s newest community space. Invite 15-20 of your closest friends for a private pizza party with complimentary pizza provided by Sizzle Pie.\nFor 25 lucky backers who pledge $500, we're handing over our marquee for you to display a personalized message. Why not use our marquee to surprise a friend and grab a photo! We'll choose a date together, and display your message from 11pm through 2pm the following day.\nFor $1,000 we're offering two tickets to a backers-only movie-themed dinner with award-winning local chef Naomi Pomeroy at her restaurant, Beast.\nFor $2,500, we'll walk you and 16 friends through airport security and screen a movie of your choosing at our PDX microcinema (schedule permitting). For $5,000, we'll screen your favorite movie for you and your friends at the Hollywood Theatre (schedule permitting).\nAnd if that's not enough, for $10,000, we'll screen 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, or WEST SIDE STORY in 70mm for you and 383 of your friends at the Hollywood Theatre (schedule permitting).\nWe'd like to thank Mike Clark for bringing this unique opportunity to us, for his all his generosity and hard work, and for his trust in the team at the Hollywood Theatre. We'd also like to thank the staff at Movie Madness (our future co-workers, we hope!) for their collaboration and enthusiasm for this project.\nThanks also to Todd Haynes for agreeing to host our very special double feature, Naomi Pomeroy and the staff at Beast for offering to host our backer dinner, Blue Chalk for our incredible project video (featuring Joaquin Lopez and Anahelena Goodman-Flood\u2014thank you!), Scarecrow Video for their advice and insights, Nate Ashley for his tireless work designing our campaign reward materials, and Andy McMillan for assisting with this Kickstarter project and managing our reward fulfillment.\nThank you also to Alison Hallett and Kristy Conrad for their extra effort on this Kickstarter campaign, and the rest of our office and theatre staff for their hard work day in and day out, our board for their steadfast guidance, and all 3,200+ Hollywood Theatre members for their support.\n\u201cMovie Madness is a place where a love of movies is completely and totally evident. An entire consummate encyclopedic collection of rare and obscure titles goes away if Movie Madness goes away. It would be not just the loss of an extraordinary collection, but a loss of a place that is a real, breathing tribute to the love of movies. It keeps you excited about the world to discover places like this.\u201d\n\u2014 Todd Haynes, Film Director & Hollywood Theatre Board Member \n\u201cThe Movie Madness library that the Hollywood Theatre would like to absorb is one of the most amazing collections of cinema archaeology that I have ever seen and it is very important that it be saved. This is a very worthy endeavor - give money to this project!\u201d\n\u2014 Gus Van Sant, Film Director\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine better bastions of film and TV history combining forces to create a whole new entertainment future for Portland than the Hollywood Theatre and Movie Madness. It\u2019s going to be tough to decide which one to spend more time in!\u201d \n\u2014 Tim Williams, Executive Director, Oregon Film\n\u201cUnparalleled in its breadth, depth, and genuine quirkiness, Movie Madness is the keeper of an important legacy. So much of the classic cinema behind its doors just isn\u2019t available anywhere else. Like a library, Movie Madness looks to enhance the future by preserving the past. I offer my full support to Hollywood Theatre and its effort to serve Portlanders, now and into the future, by preserving Movie Madness as a treasure for everyone to enjoy.\u201d \n\u2014 Vailey Oehlke, Director of Libraries, Multnomah County Library\n\u201cTruly great independent video stores with a collection of this size are an incredible asset for cinephile research and study. We can\u2019t tell you how many films have slipped into a copyright and/or distribution morass - there are many instances where a collection of early commercial releases like this is your only chance to see something exceptionally rare and unique. To lose such an incredible community resource would be heartbreaking.\u201d \n\u2014 Todd Wiener, Motion Picture Archivist, UCLA Film & Television Archive", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a community-supported nonprofit, we have a wealth of experience delivering on large-scale fundraising and crowdfunding efforts, having previously raised significant funds to bring 70mm film presentation back to Portland and managed multiple projects to restore our 1926 movie palace, including a prior Kickstarter to revive our marquee.\n\nWe've worked closely with Mike Clark to develop a transition plan for Movie Madness. He\u2019s ready to hand over the reins and we're ready to take them. At first, there will be no significant change to day-to-day operations at Movie Madness. Gradually, we'll begin to expand membership, begin work on the new screening room, etc.\n\nIf we don't raise the money, we don't buy the business.

Siuda", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "  Scroll to the bottom to see what people are saying about AURORA!\n  Help us finish our unique film!  \nPoster by graphic novel legend Dave McKean (Arkham Asylum, The Sandman)\n    Aurora is a unique 30-minute film inspired by the mantra: \"What if Alejandro Jodorowsky created a Twilight Zone episode?\"\nA \"creature feature\" art-film homage to Universal Monsters and 1950s westerns, all the puzzle pieces are now on the table, we just desperately need help to pull everything together.  With your support, this movie can be completely finished before the end of the year!\nSilent cinema, Hammer Horror, psychic science, and UFOs.\nMy friends John Terendy (cinematographer), Aaron Shaps (my co-writer and co-director), and I grew up on Fortean Times, Man Myth & Magic, and Chariots of the Gods? and love weird UFO history, so we decided to take a little-known historical record, pull it as far into the realms of conspiracy theories as possible, and then bring it back until it matched what we know today.  It was exciting to write an absolutely outlandish story where, if you check it against the news reports from the past century, everything lines up.  Read on to see what bizarre liberties we took with the story of...\nThe first documented UFO crash in American history. \nIt is widely believed that Roswell, New Mexico is the site of the first UFO crash in American history- but that distinction actually goes to a small town in Texas. According to an historical account reported in the local newspaper, early in the morning on April 17, 1897, the residents of Aurora (located just outside of Fort Worth) were awakened by a loud explosion as an inexplicable airship crashed to Earth\u2013six years before the first flight of the Wright Bros, and 40 years before the town even had electricity. A body was found at the site and buried in an unmarked grave in the town cemetery, the wreckage was thrown into a deep well, and a legend was born.\nSignal Service officer T. J. Weems, the military presence at the site, was coincidentally (or not) an expert in Astronomy and reported that the creature was a Martian. The well water where the wreckage was reportedly dumped appeared to be tainted in some way from that point forward, causing strange afflictions. Almost 80 years later in the 1970s, a grave widely believed to be that of the unknown pilot was robbed before the body could be exhumed by university scientists, and a fragment of metal unearthed in Aurora defied scientific explanation.  \nAll this leads to the question:\nWhat crashed in Aurora, Texas, in 1897?\n  A popular conspiracy theory is that German scientists developed an antigravity engine in the 1940s that powered a saucer-shaped craft called Die Glocke, or \"the bell,\" and that these test flights were responsible for the increase in UFO sightings in that era.  I won't go into detail here, but a google search will open up a Pandora's box of theories- including that the experimental craft was capable of inter-dimensional and time travel.  What if they were right?  What if the 1940s and the 1897 UFO sightings were connected?\nThe Fledermaus Pilot.\nOur first step was designing the suit for the test pilot for Die Glocke; he would need to be alien and elegant, and we needed a visionary to conjure our retro-futuristic fashion. Brom is high among the most celebrated artists in the world of Fantasy (in 2013 his thirty-year career was honored with the prestigious Spectrum Grand Master award), and he's also one of the genuinely nicest men I know.  To design the costume for Die Glocke's test pilot\u2013from an elite division of pilots known as Fledermaus, or \"bat\"\u2013I gave Brom one direction: imagine if 1930s sportscar maven Ettore Bugatti were designing a deep-sea diving suit.  And to construct the suit with an eye towards hypersensual fetishism, we needed someone rooted in fashion over costuming\u2013the atelier Ritual crafted the perfect embodiment of our vision and Brom\u2019s design.\nNothing says \"1897\" like a Nazi in a black leather space suit.\nThe creature.\nThe inter-dimensional travels of Die Glocke attracted the attention of a rare and peculiar cryptid-style creature we affectionately named Pango; to create this extra-dimensional cryptid SyFy Face Off winners Rayce Bird and J. Anthony Kosar envisioned a bear-pangolin hybrid and Rayce's team brought him to life using masterful skills in creating time-tested practical effects.\nFinal concept sketch before production\n  Production painting by Symbolist painter Gail Potocki\n  Before construction, Rayce used a computer to 3-D model the suit\n  Pango during the sculpting process\n    Jack Campbell starred in the two most-watched programs in Australian television history: the internationally acclaimed series Underbelly: Razor as the notorious legend of Sydney's 1920s underworld \"Big Jim\" Devine, and the award-winning All Saints as the romantic Dr. Steve Taylor. I met with Jack the day he moved here from Australia, and he's the finest leading man I could imagine to portray the gravitas of a soldier thrust into the cauldron of one of the greatest mysteries of the late 19th century.\nThe Aurora screenplay was specifically written with English film, television, and theatre actor Robert Boulter in mind. He's best known for a recurring role as Kieron Fletcher on the BBC series Casualty, turns in the theatre productions Mercury Fur and Citizenship, and the film Donkey Punch. Boulter's meticulous stagecraft delivers the subtle, magnetic intensity needed to humanize a complicated character, delivering a performance reminiscent of legendary silent film star Conrad Veidt. \nBehind-the-scenes photos of the filming of Aurora... To learn more click here: https://www.aurorafilm.info/blog\n  No one on the planet is better equipped to conjure the tones needed to create an alien language than visionary artist Genesis P-Orridge. From honors including being named the legendary \"Godperson of Industrial Music,\" founding the psychedelic, world-shaking band Psychic TV and their most recent incarnation PTV3, and changing the minds of magicians and artists everywhere as a visionary cultural engineer, Genesis is comfortable moving through dimensions other than this earthly plane. Utilizing cut-up techniques inspired by William S. Burroughs, Genesis provides the voice of the creature.\nThe eerie and jarring moments on the soundtrack are the work of two of my favorite musicians on the planet: the unearthly sounds of elegant avant-garde thereminist Armen Ra, and experimental rock drummer Brian Viglione (Nine Inch Nails, Dresden Dolls, Violent Femmes).\nThe gorgeous orchestrations that completely bring Aurora to life were created by composer Troy Sterling Nies; his work for the H. P. Lovecraft Society is equal parts terrifying and heartbreakingly beautiful. Tying all the music together is production master Joe Cassidy of the Belfast-founded band Butterfly Child and Shepard Fairey's L.A. art project N\u00d8ISE.\n \nIn our case, we envisioned a certain kind of movie: Black and white. Western. Science Fiction. Cryptid-style monster. UFOs. Twilight Zone-style anthology. These are all subjects that are a lot of fun and have a lot of artistic integrity, but not much commercial appeal to a larger studio. If you love the things on this list as much as I do, supporting us on Kickstarter is how we can finish the film and make this unique story come to life, exactly as imagined and with NO artistic compromise.\n  All the money raised goes directly into the production and manufacturing of rewards.  There are also a number of post-production steps including taking our edit into a studio for what is called grading- where it's fixed to look right on every possible viewing platform- and the same step on the audio side, called mastering. Those are expensive steps, but necessary.  Many of the people on this page believed both in me and in this movie so much that they have generously deferred payment until we could run a Kickstarter- so we will hopefully have enough left over to get everyone caught up as well.  It would be impossible for this movie to be profitable, but without this Kickstarter campaign it will take another two years to get everything for this movie finished.\nAbove all else you get not only my deepest gratitude, but I can share that you'll have the appreciation of everyone involved with this project\u2013 there are an infinite number of pursuits more financially rewarding than being an artist, and our culture continues to move on a path where everything is available and everything is free- making the support of the people who want to experience the artwork more directly necessary than ever.  By helping us make this you also get the invisible badge of being someone who took part in an act of creation.  \nWhile that is both romantic and noble, my friends and I have all banded together to make it rewarding on the physical plane as well by making some very special objects.  Not all of the designs are finalized, but we promise that they will be gorgeous, tactile experiences that will exceed your expectations!\nTwo-disc sets (The movie and the soundtrack)\nSpecially-printed movie posters (Letterpress, varnish-layered offset)\nTintype photo facsimiles (Insanely cool 1897-style metal print photos)\nVinyl records (We will be going really far with this packaging.)\nT-shirts (High-quality screenprinted vintage-style tees)\nEnamel pin of the creature!\n\n    Please note: if you select the Complete Poster tier ($250) you will receive ALL the posters published- all 6 posters with text, and also any variant posters that we produce (up to 11 posters for $250!)\nWet-plate photographer Anton Orlov brought his 19th century camera to the set, and took photos of the cast and crew in the wild west setting. We'll reprint some of these onto metal plates with modern ink techniques so that you can hang on your wall perfect 8\" x 10\" facsimiles of the tintype photos- these look and feel just like the original metal plate photos!\nThe vinyl record and the wax cylinder will contain the sounds of Troy Sterling Nies, Genesis P-Orridge, Armen Ra, Brian Viglione, Andrew Dalziell, Joe Cassidy, and myself (Thomas Negovan).  I also did a TEDx talk on archaic technologies, so we will be releasing a song on wax cylinder that won't be available anywhere else*.\n*really.\n      I've always devoted my life to trying to encourage connection through art and stories. For over twenty years I've written books on history and art, and curated exhibitions of late 19th and early 20th century artworks of art and artists who have inspired much of today\u2019s popular culture. Researching fascinating history and finding ways to share those stories with the world in an exciting way\u2013 plus decades of hands-on contact with the finest relics from earlier eras\u2013 has helped me develop an intense sensitivity to aesthetics and visual art.\nFor my first art project exploring the 19th century, I gave a TEDx talk on archaic technologies back in 2011. \nAurora is the next step in that evolution.\nAs a kid, my two favorite shows were The Twilight Zone and The Rifleman. Now as a dad, I find myself wanting to create something that might inspire my son when he's a little bit older. With this project, I wanted to create something that had the excitement of the 1950s and 1960s television shows I watched in syndication on Sunday afternoons, but with an undercurrent that was absolutely modern.\nI can't articulate how grateful I am for everyone involved in this project, for their incredible support and creative energy. If I typed how much the people named here mean to me, the page would be overflowing with love.\nI hope that you are as excited about this film as I am, and just as excited for the posters and tintypes and records!

Siuda", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "\"Have courage to think for yourself! That is the motto of the Enlightenment.\"\n--Immanuel Kant, \"What is Enlightenment?\" 1784\nThree years ago, more than seven hundred backers successfully kickstarted a project to create a free college-level textbook in logic and critical thinking. And here it is, still free.\nSince then, I've received helpful critical comments from many students and teachers, for how to improve the text, or how to use it in high schools and other situations. And the place for rationality in the public sphere has changed. So it's time to create a second edition.\nWe now have a greater social need for a book like this.\nWe live in a social and cultural environment where \"alternative facts\", \"post truth\", and \u201cfake news\u201d, has replaced truth, snarkiness has replaced debate, and the word reality itself serves only to get attention for various artificial contrivances (\u201creality TV\u201d, \u201cvirtual reality\u201d, \u201creal fruit flavour!\u201d).\nUpdating this book, and getting it into as many hands as possible for the lowest possible price-- as low as completely free, for the students-- looks to me like one way I can do something about this.\nThis little book might not change the world. But it will change the education of a few hundred students every year. You can help make that happen, by backing this project, and sharing it with everyone you know.\nWe also still have the original problem.\nCommercially available textbooks are too expensive. Our first edition was free in its PDF edition, $0.99 on Kindle, and less than $8 for its print edition. The usual price of a college or university level intro-philosophy textbook runs to between $50 and $80. I still think that's too much-- especially given the other financial burdens that students today must bear.\nI would like to hire designers, editors, and contributors, and together produce an elegantly designed and professionally written textbook, without passing the production costs on to the students. So I'm turning to Kickstarter, and to you, for help.\nThe Book\nThe first edition covered the following topics, all of which need to be updated:\nQuestions, Problems, and World Views\nGood and Bad Thinking Habits\nBasics of Argumentation\nFallacies\nReasonable Doubt\nMoral Reasoning\nFor the second edition, I'm planning new chapters including:\nMedia literacy, propaganda, and disinformation.\nRhetoric and persuasion.\nScience and scientific method.\nOther topics as time and funding may allow, such as strategic reasoning, game theory, art and creativity, or health and wellness.\nAnd as a stretch goal, we will create an inclusive outline history of world philosophy. And it, too, will be published electronically for free, and in paperback for the lowest possible price.\nThe People Behind The Book\nAll the writers and contributors who worked on the first edition are back on board for the second. We all have Ph.Ds in philosophy, and we all have 10-15 years of teaching experience each, at colleges and universities in Canada, the United States, and Europe.\nAnd, as with the first edition, I will engage the services of Winter-Hebert Design Studio, for the cover and the interior layout.\nThe Backer Rewards\nObviously, you'll get the book itself, and an accompanying set of PowerPoint slides. Backers at higher levels will receive copies of my other books, and a chance to chat with me, in focus groups or via Skype, about the book and what you think should go in it.\nMy novels-- also fully funded by Kickstarter!\n  And if we raise more than our target?\nAt $6,000, I will bring more writers and contributors into the project, so we can plan more chapters. And I will audio-record myself reading Socrates' Apology, as a dramatic performance, and publish it on YouTube and as an audio-book. (Besides philosophy, I also have a drama degree, and I've always wanted to do this. In fact I'm already rehearsing.)\nAt $10,000, I will continue to hire more contributors, and we will create a free outline history of world philosophy, and publish it as a separate book. Backers at all levels will receive the electronic edition; and backers who get a print copy of the logic book will have the option of receiving the history book instead. Backers who pledge $75 or more will have the option to get both books.\nAbove and beyond: I will pay for more contributors, and if funds allow then I will commission a French language translation.\nThe Budget\nRemuneration to writers and contributors: $ 2,500\nCover design & interior layout: $ 800\nEditor: $ 500\nPrinting and shipping books and backer rewards: $1,200*\nSubtotal: $ 5,000\nKickstarter's cut, and bank fees: $ 400 (8% of subtotal)\nFinal total: $ 5,400.**\n*Estimate for 100 books, mostly sent to Canada & the USA.\n**Yes, my Kickstarter target is slightly less than the budget. I will cover the extra costs personally.\nThe Production Schedule\nKickstarter campaign: Jan 24 - Feb 22.\nFirst draft complete and sent to focus groups: June 2017.\nReception of comments from focus groups: July 2017.\nFinal version of text complete: August 2017\nDesign work complete: October 2017.\nBacker rewards start shipping: November 2017.\nIf we reach our stretch goal of $ 10,000, then we will aim to have the history book ready for the backers by December of 2017.\nThank you for your support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nVery few.

At the center of culture is food: This is a sacred element which connects family with neighbors, friends, and distant relatives across generations. In our country, we get to enjoy neighborhood Italian or Chinese restaurants, where patrons re-connect with what was the glue for grandparents and their parents before them. Yet, where are our First Peoples foods and accompanying restaurants? What is the Indigenous cuisine that weaves together and builds our original nations of the Lakota, Ojibwa, Iroquois, or Yurok? How strong can culture be, without our Indigenous foods sustaining us, connecting us to our ancestors? \nToday, we have an opportunity to celebrate the historic foods of each North American region, starting with the foods of the Dakota and Ojibwa. Under the guidance of Chef Sean Sherman, Oglala Lakota from the Pine Ridge Reservation, the first all Indigenous Native American restaurant can become this sacred gathering place.\nOur First Nations mastered wild edibles, wild game and fish, and refined heirloom seeds that have been domesticated for centuries. With over 500 tribes across the country, these cultures and their accompanying flavors and food systems were diverse and rich. It is time for The Sioux Chef, an Indigenous Kitchen to become a gathering place for exceptional pre-colonial food, a culinary training center for Native peoples, and a new celebration of our American culture. \nBe a part of a new relationship with Indian Country. Sit at our table. Pass a bowl of bison with a chokecherry demi-glaze over wild greens. Drink a cup of cedar tea. We have a new history to write over a beautiful, perfect meal.\nMN State Fair Food Demo\n WHAT WE WANT\nThe Sioux Chef team wants your help to open the first all Indigenous restaurant featuring the foods of our region, namely the Minnesota and Dakota territories. These are the foods of many great cultures including the Ojibwe, Dakota, Lakota, Hidatsa, Arikara, Mandan, Cheyenne, Crow, Arapaho, Winnebago, Ho-Chunk and more!\nChef Sean Sherman is Oglala Lakota and was born on Pine Ridge Reservation in SD, and one day he asked, \"Why is it that you can find cuisine from all over the world in our many great cities, but not the food that comes from right under our feet, the food that is Native to our regions and the Indigenous Peoples?\" We want to change that and we want you to help us redefine Native American Foods for the modern world!\nChef Sean after teaching Indigenous Food Systems to youth from 51 Tribal Nations...\nOUR VISION\nAfter over a decade studying Indigenous food systems and working with tribes from across the country, Chef Sean along with his partner Dana Thompson, and their team are ready to open The Sioux Chef, an Indigenous Kitchen, the first Native American restaurant of its kind. Bringing back the ancient methods of food preparation over wood fire and open Comal grills, The Sioux Chef will be a healthy and authentic family style dining experience. \nBy raising $100K in equity, we would be able to leverage mission aligned, alternative financing. However, if we can excel beyond this target amount, our success will multiply allowing us to more quickly move towards sustainability including creating a wood fired cooking line, and removing a short term dependence of petroleum. If we are able to raise $150K-$250k, our capacity to leverage matching funds and secure low interest long term loans will allow us to purchase a building to house a sustainable, community space and lessen the inherent risk of the restaurant industry. We are actively searching buildings and locations under the careful guidance of real estate agents in the Minneapolis and St Paul metropolitan area. The more we raise, the less we will need in loans, and the greater our success and impact. This project will be our flagship restaurant with an opportunity to replicate in more regions to showcase the true regional diversity we have with our historical and cultural Native foods.\nChef Sean Foraging at Dusk\n THE SPACE WE ENVISION\nThe Sioux Chef, an Indigenous Kitchen is designed to be a community gathering place, requiring at least 4000 sq. ft. to seat a minimum of 100 people for lunch, dinner, and possibly brunch. Our vision includes a multi-use space including a meeting room and a garden, to help our customers with teaching and community experiences. Indigenous foods like native heirloom corn, squash, beans, sunflower, cedar, chokecherry, elderflower, crab apple, raspberry and fir will be showcased. The kitchen must be big enough to house our catering operation and create teaching opportunities. You can see a mock blueprint of our restaurant at this link.\nChef's Sean and Tashia Plating\nWHAT WE WILL INCLUDE WITH OUR RESTAURANT\nThe Sioux Chef, an Indigenous Kitchen, will be more than a restaurant. Through our existing catering and education business, we have been traveling around the world showcasing Indigenous food and providing teaching opportunities. We have worked with tribes and their youth, and fed elders in over twenty nations, have flown to India for the Slow Foods World Forum on Indigenous foods, Italy to cook at the James Beard American Restaurant at the World Fair Expo and New York City for the United Nations. \nWe have already established a brand that is based on combining the best of our Northern American Indigenous foods with community building. Consequently, our space will have community meeting space and room for Chef's Table. We will continue to partner with our existing network of other executive Native chefs, to hold dinners, which would celebrate and showcase the cuisines of other tribal regions. We will host weekly rotations of regional and national Native artists, singers, dancers, storytellers, poets, and chefs, connecting our cultures with food in the way they have always been linked and celebrated. We will continue to celebrate and showcase seasonal selection of Indigenous teas. Our outdoor space will be critical, complete with a patio and outdoor grill/Comal to share the traditional preparation of our foods.\nPlates from one of our numerous catering events...\n HOW WE PLAN TO SPEND THE MONEY\nThe funds raised will secure business loans and economic development funds to purchase a building within the Minneapolis / St Paul area.

With your help and patience, The Sioux Chef, an Indigenous Kitchen will become alive and lead the future of Native American cuisine to preserve and showcase the foods and culture of Midwest's Native Americans.\n\nRestaurants are notoriously risky enterprises. However, the national climate is ready for this concept, a deeper notion of farm to table, increasing the concept further, thinking woodlands to table, lake to table, prairie to table has existed for centuries and with our already established success within the marketplace we are ready to bring this back. We have been humbled by the attention of NPR, Art Culinaire, Thomas Keller's Finesse Magazine, Cowboys and Indians, The Guardian UK, Mic.com, 2015 Expo, and James Beard. Through this regional, national, and international support, we have grown a successful and profitable catering business to service international customers, while garnering over 10,000 followers on social media. \n\nWith your support, we can house this cusp of potential in the right location, in a rich urban Indian community of Minneapolis/St. Paul in a building designed for teaching, serving, and creating community. If our Kickstarter is unsuccessful in raising the minimum $100k we need to begin, then we will have to reassess our strategy and make a calculated decision, the more we raise above our goal, the more freedom we will have to create the space and extend our impact.\n\nFood is culture. It connects us in new and important ways. Come, be a part of The Sioux Chef, an Indigenous Kitchen. Experience Indian Country in ways that previously have been impossible. Invest in the next generation of Native chefs. Invest in a food concept that is innovating the field. Invest in more than farm to table. Invest in lake to table, woodlands to table, prairie to table. Invest in more sustainable practices and the wisdom of a People that continues to deepen our relationship with environment. Be a part of a movement. WOPILA.

The 2017 version!\nnearly entirely different from the previous calendar!\nLet's start at the beginning.\nI'm Dr. Dante Shepherd. For the past eight years, I've been producing Surviving The World, a daily photocomic with a chalkboard and labcoat and lessons touching on just about everything (science, literature, creeping people out, you name it). The comic is a mix of humor and education combined with complete destruction of the fourth wall. In my real life, I'm an actual professor, and in STW, I pretend to be.  And the comic is a whole lot funnier!\nOne of over 2800 STW comics\nPage-a-day calendars?\nWe previously made a page-a-day calendars for 2014 through a Kickstarter, and they came out friggin' amazing.  6.25 inches by 6.25 inches, weighty, full color, utterly beautiful.\nThe 2014 ones came out friggin' amazing. So let's make new ones for 2017! With new content!\nYou could plaster your door or your fridge with them.  You could plaster your dog with them.  The stand-alone content worked perfectly as a page-a-day calendar, and given that there are now over 2800 comics to choose from, you'll get a solid 365 days of content!\nNot only that, but these calendars will contain 50 ORIGINAL STW COMICS!  That's on top of pulling from the best of the previous 2800+ comics!\nLook at these beautiful pages! Let's do it again!\nAnd each page has other content to enjoy!  Besides a comic on each page you get:\n- a fake international holiday inspired by a real historical event for every single day of the year!\n- a rudimentary word-of-the-day, basically making your calendar two-calendars-in-one, but in this case, we reaffirm the quality of your present vocabulary!  Who needs to learn new words when you're already good at words!\n- a cloud name for each day of the year! Hurricane centers tell you what hurricanes are called and some weather channels tell you what winter storms are called, but this calendar goes even further and unilaterally tells you what the clouds themselves are named!\nWhat else?\nTo thank you for your contribution to the campaign, there are number of pretty cool rewards available at the different tiers, many of which will only be available through this Kickstarter. These rewards may even increase your happiness, which, hey, who doesn't want that?  \nWhat are some of these great rewards?\nWell, let's talk about them!\nRecognition on the Surviving the World site itself! (And you'll even get a nickname of questionable coolness!)\nA PDF form of the 2017 calendar!\nA hard copy of the 2017 calendar!\nA leftover hard copy of the 2014 calendar! \nMagnets depicting classic STW mazes to help hang up the pages of the calendar that you display!\nMaze for Magnet #1\nThe STW class report card printed on a whiteboard, for your own personal life assessment!\nInitial report card design!\nA STW-specialized black dry-erase board!\nA personalized mini-slate chalkboard with a permanent lesson, personalized for whatever subject matter you want!\nSomeone last time requested their slate lesson be about \"potatoes\"\nAn original maze painting on canvas, with colors of your choosing!\nI will even once again eat a pound of raisins (and hate every second of it and be utterly miserable in more ways than one that day), just like last time!\nThere are even crazy tier levels, like getting a ball of cat hair with your rewards, or having me draw a mustache on my face on every page!\nAnd may reward tiers include various combinations of these rewards!\nAnything else? \nActually, yes! There are a number of STW items which you can directly choose to include as a reward if you add it on to your backing tier. These can include additional calendars as well. First, select the reward tier that you're interested in, with the amount necessary to support the campaign at that tier. Then, make your donation an additional amount to reflect the add-on item that you wanted. This will cover the shipping of both items, too.\nThe pricing for the add-on items are as follows:  \nAn extra calendar = $25\nA set of 4 black-and-white STW mini-books containing lessons from the site, signed and personalized = $10\nA set of 12 STW squid-themed Christmas cards = $12\nA velociraptor USB containing over nearly 50 different velociraptor impressions = $15\nAn official STW labcoat = $40\nA signed official STW labcoat = $45\nStretch goals?\nIf we're fortunate enough to hit the target and keep on going from there, we will not only continue to improve the content of the calendar itself but also improve the content of the rewards that you receive!  So consider, if we break the following overall tiers:\n$27,500 \u2013 FLURRY OF CHALKDUST: the calendar will contain 12 new STW comics - ON TOP OF THE 50 ORIGINAL COMICS already part of the calendar!  So a total of 62 ORIGINAL COMICS!\n$30,000 \u2013 THE AUDIOBOOK: a digital recording of me reading the entire calendar will be provided to all backers\n$35,000 \u2013 THE SOUNDTRACK: a soundtrack listing to go with every calendar page will be provided to all backers\n$40,000 \u2013 REFRIGERATOR EXTRAVAGANZA: two additional magnets to the magnet set for every A-PLUS and higher level\n$45,000 - TO BE ANNOUNCED as we get closer \nSo fingers crossed!\nAll of this and all of that sounds awesome!\nI agree!

You will love these calendars!\nThank you for your support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe calendar design is complete, and most of the content is already prepared.

Kickstarter-funded, finished, and delivered!\nThe gods and heroes of ancient times were only human.\nBut a little faster, a little stronger, a little wiser, than the rest of us.\nTime and history expanded the stories of their lives, transforming them into myth and legend-- transforming them into gods.\nPerhaps their descendants still walk among us.\nPerhaps you are one of them.\n\u201cThe Hidden Houses\u201d are the modern-day descendants of the gods of every mythology and culture on earth. Calling themselves the Secret People, or the Hiddenfolk, their ancestry gives them extraordinary talents and magical powers, but also an ancient struggle to control the last remaining places on Earth where the Mythic Age survives.\nPre-production image of characters from the novels: Maread MacBride and Aeducan Brigand.\nIt's a fairy tale. Your characters live in the 21st century. Yet they also live in places where cupboard doors open to magical gardens, fantastic creatures still stalk the night, and wizards invite people on adventures. Hidden in forests, mountain tops, caves, and even big city neighborhoods, the Freeholds, as such places are called, preserve what the world was like when the gods still walked among us.\nIt's a political thriller. Just as nations and corporations in the real world compete for control of sea ports and oil fields, your characters must struggle to protect their Freeholds from rival houses. The Hidden World has a \"Secret Commonwealth\" with democratic parliaments and an informal constitution; but the Lords of the many Freeholds still fight a \"cold war\" among themselves to protect and increase their territories. For without the Freeholds, your characters lose touch with their ancestral sources of power. They become ordinary mortals, or they die.\nPre-production image: Eric LaFlamme and Ildicoe Brigand, over the village of Fellwater.\nIt's based on the Kickstarter-funded fantasy fiction series Fellwater: The Hidden Houses, written by the same author. The game thus takes place in a rich and full world, with a long history for players to explore. You don't need to have read the books to enjoy the game. But the novels are included in some of the backer rewards. Reviewers on Amazon and other places have favourably compared the books to the work of Neil Gaiman and George R.R. Martin. These books are completely finished, and will be delivered immediately after the campaign succeeds!\nThe rules are designed to emphasize character customization, and mythology-inspired storytelling. Players create characters by choosing one each of the following:\nFour Sources: each is a wellspring of magical power and also a philosophical world view. Choose from The Earth, The Elements, The Mind, and The Divine.\nTwelve Lineages: the character's cultural background. Become a Kami, a Deva, a DeDannan, a Manitou, an Orisha, a Djinni, and more!\nSeven Paths. Play as an Agent, a Fighter, a Mystic, a Scholar, a Rascal, a Ranger, a Jack, or as any multiclassed combination!\nFour Seasons of the Soul, from the adventurous and innocent Spring, to the wise and battle-hardened Winter.\nThis makes over 1,300 possibilities for your character's basic identity. Once the game is underway, the player can multi-class in as many Paths as she wants, and learn Talents for each Path in almost any sequence. So the possibilities for unique characters are nearly endless.\nFinally, you can join (or opt out of joining) one of the Hidden Houses themselves-- the hundreds of sub-lineage family dynasties that rule the Freeholds of the Hidden World. Take this quiz to find out which House from the novels you should join!\nPre-production image: Siobhan Summercraft, Amergin DeDannan, Carlo DiAngelo, and \"a friend\".\nThe game's in-house engine is a skill-based system where players \"level up\" by raising their skills to certain thresholds, and learning Talents that belong to their chosen Paths. The rules take less than three minutes to learn, and are designed to keep as much dramatic tension and surprise in the game as possible. Moreover, the game will come with compatibility rules for popular game engines like Pathfinder, Apocalypse World, and d20. Download the 118-page preview document here to find out for yourself right now!\nThe game is finished. But it's not yet ready for release.\nThe text of the game is complete, and runs to more than 250 pages-- and that's without illustrations! But as an independent game designer and publisher, I know that players expect and deserve a professionally made product. Your contribution will allow me to pay for editors and proofreaders, hire experts to write compatibility notes for other game engines, as well as hire layout designers and artists. In fact more than half of the budget is for art and design. If the campaign is successful, I will bring in more artists, and if we reach our stretch goals we'll make as much of the art as we can in full colour.\nI'm the author of sixteen books, and a TED speaker, and twice a successful Kickstarter. By day I'm a philosophy prof at a local college. Having an M.A. and Ph.D in philosophy means that I understand logic, algorithms, cosmology and metaphysics, political theory and strategy, and the principles of mathematical game theory \u2013 perfect for designing an RPG system, as well as the larger world views and conflicts in which the characters find themselves. I've invented several games for use in my college classroom as teaching tools, one of which, Iron Age, my students encouraged me to publish. Check the backer rewards-- you can get that game here too! (In fact, if your backer level allows you one of the novels but you'd rather have this game, I'll be happy to send it instead.)\nAt the same time, from my B.A. in drama, I also understand narrative arcs and dramatic tension\u2013 perfect for world building, character design, and the like. On top of that, I\u2019ve also undertaken a lifelong study of mythology and folklore \u2013 I\u2019ve published several books on the topic \u2013 which is helpful for all those things I've mentioned here, and more.\nPre-production image: Miranda Brigand and Old Hobb.\n A final note: Games are good for us.\nGames help us develop all kinds of skills, from hand-eye coordination to strategic planning. They help us build empathy with team-mates, and they can encourage the kind of competition that leads to excellence. Games can even be used to explain social justice issues, or to assist people recovering from illnesses. And, of course, games are fun! \nI also think that storytelling games like this one are important because it's through storytelling that we explore and experiment with answers to life's most important questions. Therefore, I've crafted this game with a few philosophical dimensions. But the philosophical side is mostly in the background. There's also giant gorillas with four arms.\nPre-production image: Paul Turner and a gargantacore.\nBet your intro philosophy books didn't have those!\nSo, come and play in my back yard!\nI've had a lot of fun writing this game, and I want to share that fun with you.

For my previous Kickstarter project, and my self-published novels, I used Amazon Createspace as the printer and distributor. I'll be using it again for this project, too. I also have an account with Library & Archives Canada, so I can issue my own ISBN's, and so I anticipate no delays there. But if anything of a technical nature were to interrupt the project, I have scouted some excellent local printers and bookbinders who I can work with instead. (Of course, if Amazon were to fail, it would be because the entire internet has failed, and we will all have bigger problems.)\n\nI will keep the backers completely informed about the production process at all times, and with complete transparency.

These occult Lodges attracted the elite of London society \u2013 poets and politicians, actors and heiresses, alchemists and aristocrats scheming against a backdrop of cut glass, in the age of absinthe.\nYou play one of these eccentric characters, choose a faction and an agenda \u2013 do you want to proceed through the mystic Grades to achieve enlightenment? To take over? To destroy from within? \u2013 and speed from location to location to secure ancient knowledge, spread rumours, and foil your opponent\u2019s efforts.\nA s\u00e9ance gone horribly wrong. A gentleman approached after a Mason\u2019s meeting with an inquiry if he\u2019d be interested in something more\u2026unconventional. A book dealer looking over an incoming tome, and knowing more than he lets on. Somewhere in London, between Scotland Yard and the Blind Beggar, is the key to someone\u2019s lifelong obsession. Seek it out. But will you use it, sell it, or destroy it?\nThrow the best parties, summon demons, and keep it out of the papers!\nThe game is built around a simple d6 system new players can master in minutes. The GM is a \u201cshow-runner\u201d who narrates each session\u2019s 3 act structure by introducing new plot points along the way. As a stretch-goal, we will create an integrated Pathfinder Compatible version of the game (thanks to Steven Saunders of Black Goat Games).\nThe game is illustrated in part by Aly Fell, and for colour we\u2019re including flash-fiction from Jordan Stratford (Wollstonecraft), Brendan Myers (Fellwater), Blake Northcott (vs Reality), Astra Crompton (Otherworlds), Scott Jones, Steven Saunders, Kiri Calaghan, Carl Grindley and others.\nIn the game, your character will meet up others to complete certain assignments given to you by your Lodge superiors. You'll track down ancient manuscripts, occult artifacts, conduct elaborate rituals \u2013 and foil your rivals from doing the same. Your party will venture from one authentic turn-of-the-century London location to another, and at each stop you'll be interacting with the environments, character and events potential to each locale. The role of a dice is always a factor \u2013 or is it unseen influence?\nThe Story So Far\nThe mechanic, game description, character archetypes, locations, items, rival factions and plot-events are already written. Pledgers will receive a beautiful library of digital assets which will make gameplay more real and immersive. We\u2019re looking for your help, so we can include the fantastic artwork, flash fiction, and more game scenarios in the first edition of the game as we release it. This will make the game as gorgeous and deep as we know it can be.\nThank you for your support!\nAs a complement to the character class system used by other mechanics, VAULT OF ADEPTS introduces over 20 distinct character archetypes for you to use as a starting-off point for your own character: The imposter, the impresario; the diplomat and the debutante, the clergyman and the curator. Each approach brings with it its own biases and skills, vulnerabilities and assets.\nFor the first release, we have descriptions of over 20 locations in 1900 London, and a dozen plot-events that can occur in each one. An accusation of theft in the British Museum, or a fire at Whitechapel Station. Mysterious hooded figures in Hyde Park, or an attempted seduction in Watkins Bookshop. The locations are illustrated with period photographs and maps.\nThe game is magic-agnostic: while the characters are casting spells and gathering tomes and artifacts, the results can be explained away by coincidence and suggestion. No fireballs (aside from Molotov cocktails), but rather a wearing away of resistance, and subtle persuasions. And of course, the chance of the dice-roll.\nThe streets of London are dangerous: We\u2019ll walk you through combat with sword-canes, umbrellas and hat pins, and the Victorian discipline of Bartitsu \u2013 the mixed martial art of Sherlock Holmes. And you never know when a Derringer in the garter might come in handy.\nWe've registered with Paizo to make this Pathfinder Compatible!\nReaching our goal will allow us to pay our contributors and license the artwork. The game uses a simple mechanic as an example, but can be used with any system with a modicum of adaptation. Exceeding that goal and reaching $12,000 allows us to seamlessly integrate Pathfinder Compatibility. Why Pathfinder? It's the best-selling RPG system in the world, and has millions of established players familiar with the mechanic. This opens up the adventures of VAULT OF ADEPTS to more players, worldwide.\n$17,000 STRETCH GOAL: Rival groups are spouting across the Continent, and more secrets are emerging from the vaults of the Bibliotheque Nationale. Lodges and Cemetieres, bookstalls and brothels all have their part to play. What undocumented treasures arrived from Napoleon\u2019s expeditions into Egypt? With your help, we can unlock the City of Lights.\n$22,000 STRETCH GOAL: Across the Atlantic, lines of loyalty and lineage are being drawn. Whole new cults emerge and quickly recede into the marshes of Massachusetts. What fortunes have washed ashore and taken root here, and what secrets squirrelled away between the Athenaeum and Beacon Hill?\n$27,000 STRETCH GOAL: Flash fiction (around 500 words) is fun and gives the game some flavour, but an anthology of short fiction (2000-5000 words) set in the world of VAULT OF ADEPTS would be marvellous.

You have helped make THE LOST SKELETON OF CADAVRA (released ten years ago this year) the cult classic that it\u2019s become, and we are grateful. Never has there been a more hands-on way to be a part of what we do than through the ingenious mechanism that is crowd-funding. Kickstarter was made for our particular fanbase, and is the ideal vehicle for bringing the third and final film of the Lost Skeleton trilogy (as it will now be known) to life. Not only will it allow our Skelites (if we can call you that) to fund THE LOST SKELETON WALKS AMONG US and become directly involved with the production, it will allow us to reach out to others, folks who have yet to discover our particular brand of absurdity. In an era where cinematic comedy is somewhat lacking in the silly and sublimely ridiculous, not to mention family-friendly, we believe there is a greater audience for our brand of wacky and Kickstarter can help us find them. Or them find us.\n WHO IS THE LOST SKELETON? \nAt the center of this series is one of the most expensive and complex movie monsters ever conceived. Actually, he began as a plastic skeleton used for medical studies and cost around 98.00 on eBay. The original LOST SKELETON OF CADAVRA was conceived as a loving spoof of bargain basement 1950s scifi-horror movies and a skeleton seemed so absolutely basic (and cheap), particularly amusing when given a stentorian, arrogant and bitingly sarcastic demeanor; far haughtier than his feeble presence could justify. We\u2019re not sure where he came from, we\u2019re not even sure exactly what he wants. Aside from the absolute power atmosphereum can give him and something like world domination. \nWHAT STARTED IT ALL - THE LOST SKELETON OF CADAVRA\nWhen Larry Blamire was looking for a creative outlet while trying to survive the Dotcom Crash of 2000 he was suddenly hit with the idea of a low budget movie that was supposed to look low budget; a loving spoof to the 1950s low budget scifi films he\u2019d grown up on. The resulting movie THE LOST SKELETON OF CADAVRA, an exercise in cheeky absurdity and good clean fun, followed a determined scientist who likes to say \u201cscience\u201d a lot, his faithful clueless wife, a pair of confused aliens, an evil scientist, an exotic woman made from four different forest animals, an escaped monster (the Mutant) and the title character, the world\u2019s haughtiest world-dominating skeleton. This labor of love was shot in 10\u00bd days with a wonderful cast that\u2019s become a stock company and working \u201cfamily\u201d (calling themselves Bantam Street), and premiered at the Egyptian Theatre before a wildly enthusiastic audience of almost 600. Among them was Sony\u2019s Michael Schlesinger who was determined to pick it up. He did and the movie was released theatrically and on DVD in 2004. Overall, the reviews were pretty spectacular, as in this sampling:\n\"A hoot.....Cadavra reaches comic heights that approach the 'Your stupid minds! Stupid, stupid, stupid!' speech from Plan 9.\" -- Glenn Kenny, PREMIERE MAGAZINE \n\"A single, giggle-inducing mutation... A '50s sci-fi spoof that's a silly hit to the funny bone.\" -- Michael Rechtshaffen, HOLLYWOOD REPORTER\n\"Parodic bull\u2019s-eye scored! ... A deft parody of \u201850s Z-grade sci-fi and horror pics, The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra will delight...!\" -- Dennis Harvey,VARIETY \n\"Insanely entertaining\" -- Tim Cogshell, BOXOFFICE MAGAZINE\n\"Not just a spoof of Fifties sci-fi/ horror pictures, but a movie of great verbal imagination in its own right ...A charming exercise in escalating absurdity... Blamire seems to invent entire worlds of absurd imagery... This is a gift, and one hopes to see Blamire carry it to greater lengths in future projects... --Tim Lucas, VIDEO WATCHDOG\n\"Tinfoil spacesuits, rubber-ribbed aliens, and ray guns.... Writer-director-star Larry Blamire re-creates B-movie scenes with precision.... Cadavra's low-rent indie roots... make it that much more amusing. -- Jon M. Gibson, WIRED MAGAZINE\n\"A cheerfully trashy, dead-on spoof of the B-movie genre.\" -- Megan Lehmann, NEW YORK POST\n\"Blamire nails Ed Wood's trademark syntactical acrobatics, and a sublimely awkward set piece featuring masquerading aliens recalls the dinner scene in Eraserhead drained of queasy dread. May be 100 percent cult-in-a-can....\" -- Mark Holcomb, VILLAGE VOICE\n\"A parody of B-movies stupid enough -- and yet with just enough brains -- to appeal to the most discriminating fans of the genre.... 'Lost Skeleton' might just come close to comedy perfection. \" -- Michael O'Sullivan, WASHINGTON POST \nSECOND OF THE TRILOGY - THE LOST SKELETON RETURNS AGAIN\nThough not a fan of sequels, and fueled by a legion of fans that wanted more Skeleton, in 2008 Larry Blamire hit upon an idea for a revisit while watching a jungle adventure on TV. What if super clean-cut Dr. Paul Armstrong became bitter and was living in the jungle and drinking heavily because science let him down? The idea was ridiculous enough and the plot elements all grew out of this notion. It would give the fans the return to these characters they\u2019d been clamoring for as well as allowing a slightly different genre to be spoofed; the 1960s adventure matinee. With strikingly Bernard Herrmannesque music from John Morgan and William Stromberg and imaginative old school production design from Anton Tremblay--not to mention Frank Ippolito\u2019s fun rubber suited monsters--this film had a slightly different flavor while retaining the original\u2019s sense of the ridiculous as everyone treks into a remote region of the Amazon in search of another elusive element, jerranium 90. All the cast returned, and quite a few new faces were added including Trish Geiger, H.M. Wynant, Daniel Roebuck, Kevin Quinn and Frank Dietz. The film was shot by A.J. Rickert-Epstein, now Blamire\u2019s go-to cinematographer. Instrumental in the execution of the film was producer Mark Allen Stuart, who will be executive producer on THE LOST SKELETON WALKS AMONG US (Mark is now Chairman and CEO at Hydraulic Entertainment of which Larry Blamire is Senior VP). Mike Schlesinger, having worked with Blamire and Bantam Street since TRAIL OF THE SCREAMING FOREHEAD, was also a producer on the film. THE LOST SKELETON RETURNS AGAIN was released in 2010 and the boys back at the lab are planning a 5 year anniversary issue of film in 2015. \nTHE LAST OF THE TRILOGY - THE LOST SKELETON WALKS AMONG US\nWhere THE LOST SKELETON OF CADAVRA was set in a rural area and THE LOST SKELETON RETURNS AGAIN the jungle, THE LOST SKELETON WALKS AMONG US is firmly in suburbia. Yes, everyone's favorite all-powerful skull could be living right next to you. We find rock scientist Dr. Paul Armstrong and his wife Betty leading the quiet life in the suburbs alongside next door neighbors Kro-Bar and Lattis who have decided to live on earth under the names Hildon and Clackie Pottadew. Meanwhile obsessed renegade East Neulmanian scientist Dr. Neesha Krome has bought the fragments of the Lost Skeleton's crushed skull and managed to piece them back together (sort of) using a highly sophisticated method of tape, bandaids and elmer's glue. The Lost Skeleton forms an alliance with her to take over the world, once his full powers are restored. But for that they need atmosphereum and Neesha quickly detects a source for the powerful element in the peaceful Blendview neighborhood. They move in right next to Paul and Betty and to fit in undetected, Neesha places her skull partner inside an automaton that happens to look exactly like deceased government agent Reet Pappin, a resemblance most confusing to the Armstrongs. After the strange new couple (going by the names Charko and Nettie Panamalanman) ingratiate themselves Betty takes it upon herself to find the awkward Charko/Lost Skeleton/Reetomaton a job, though he seems qualified for very little. At the same time, Animala, sensing a disturbance with her keen animal senses, makes her way from the Amazon. Jungle Brad, now City Brad, shows up in his new job as plainclothes policeman. Seems he's investigating a series of Radiation Murders that have taken place in Blendview, somehow unbeknownst to Paul. Sure enough, we are soon witness to the nocturnal prowlings of a mysterious monster that leaves traces of radiation at the scene of each crime. Atmosphereum, Jerranium 90, a powerful criminal organization, a stalking creature, the return of General Scottmanson, the president of the United States, uncomfortably awkward neighbors--all things come to a boil, leading to a fever pitch of stark raving terror and a duel of giant monsters that rains destruction upon the once peaceful Blendview, promising the world will never be the same. But rather, different. \nTHIS KICKSTARTER PROGRAM\nThis Kickstarter campaign will allow us to raise the money to shoot and complete the film, which we then plan to distribute ourselves (and believe us; for indies this is the way to go). Easily the most ambitious entry in the trilogy we really want to wrap things up in style; with a cast about three times larger than the original film. The climax with its monster effects and cataclysmic destruction will be overseen by TV\u2019s Monster Man himself, Cleve Hall, no stranger to recreating kaiju-style mayhem. We want to do this right or not at all, and this is the amount that will make it happen. Because the film is set in 1963 suburbia we cannot simply go out and shoot on the streets or in actual homes. The logistics of this would prove costly and time-consuming (not to mention being at the mercy of every lawn mower and leaf blower around). Also it would mean constant company moves, which are incredibly time-consuming. The perfect solution is what we did with DARK AND STORMY NIGHT: shoot the whole film on a sound stage. \nCAST AND CREW\nWriter-Director: Larry Blamire \nExecutive Producer: Mark Allen Stuart\nProducer: Michael Schlesinger \nLine Producer: Melanie Elin \nProduction Designer: Anton Tremblay \nCinematographer: A.J.

This is the absolute minimum allowed by the Screen Actors Guild, plus an additional ten percent for the performers\u2019 respective agents. These are the kind of folks that make this series what it is, and of course they have a pretty good idea they\u2019re going to have fun. A large portion of the budget will go to the sets that comprise the film\u2019s suburban setting--the \u201cstudio look\u201d will be important to the overall ambience. Add to that a decent lighting package, the best cameras we can get (we\u2019re shooting digital), props for a fair amount of sets, and period costumes for a fairly large cast. For musical score we are licensing various cues represented by David Schecter\u2019s wonderful Monstrous Movie Music label; choice vintage music that will perfectly color the period proceedings in that classic monster movie feel. We have some exciting incentives (including two speaking roles as well as crowd-terrified-by-giant-monster parts!) and we look forward to having you on board. Our fans are the best in the world; the most vocal, the most enthusiastic, and believe me that enthusiasm is infectious. They've always been a part of the Lost Skeleton experience. Now's a chance to be even more involved; as fellow producers of what we think will be the best, and funniest, movie in the Lost Skeleton Trilogy.

I will tell the audient void...\nIt\u2019s a player vs. computer (or tablet) game based on senet, an ancient Egyptian board game. We\u2019ve animated and illustrated the gameplay with the 1920s occult-investigator aesthetics of HP Lovecraft\u2019s horror classic \u201cNyarlathotep.\u201d\nWhere most dungeon-crawlers begin at the beginning, we cut to the chase. Your team of investigators has already discovered the big bad, and now it\u2019s a race to escape the labyrinth. Can you get all your team members out alive, to seal the cultists and their terrible reality-destroying amulet inside? Or will the cultists avoid the traps, beat you to the exit, entomb your team and unleash an unspeakable horror on the world?\nWe\u2019re building this in Unity, a tested and proven cross platform environment, so the game will play on PCs and Macs and Android tablets and iPads. It\u2019s fun.\nThe real-world board game version. Ours is weirder.\nIt\u2019s a chase game, played for over five thousand years. You and your opponent have five pawns each. Thrown sticks are like rolled dice, generating a random number of moves you can make. The first player to remove all their pawns from the board wins. But there are ways of moving your opponent\u2019s pawns backwards, and ways of protecting your pawns from attack. A copy of senet was found in the tomb of King Tutankhamen. So let\u2019s call it play-tested.\nActual game concept art\nInto the lands of civilization came Nyarlathotep, swarthy, slender, and sinister, always buying strange instruments of glass and metal and combining them into instruments yet stranger. He spoke much of the sciences of electricity and psychology and gave exhibitions of power which sent his spectators away speechless, yet which swelled his fame to exceeding magnitude. Men advised one another to see Nyarlathotep, and shuddered. And where Nyarlathotep went, rest vanished, for the small hours were rent with the screams of nightmare. \u2013 HP Lovecraft, \"Nyarlathotep\"\nIn Lovecraft\u2019s story he\u2019s a resurrected pharaoh, back from twenty seven centuries of sleep, and aligned with an unspeakable evil. He travels the world putting on Tesla-like displays of (1920s) technology. To see these exhibitions is to be driven mad, and his cult of worshippers threatens reality itself.\nInstead of static pawns, we\u2019ve added some classic Lovecraftian archetypes to make up your team.\nThe Scholar: An elegant bald-headed black man, carrying a thick, ancient tome shackled closed in heavy chain. Perfect for whacking cultists with.\nThe Antiquarian: A no-nonsense Englishwoman in a practical hat and a sensible tweed suit, she carries a cartoonishly large flashlight. Perfect for whacking cultists with.\nThe Nun: Oh, she does not approve of all these cultist shenanigans. Not. At. All. She has a giant iron rosary which turns out to be perfect for whacking cultists with.\nActual game concept art\nThe Detective: Fedora and trench coat and guns a-blazin\u2019, he\u2019s a two-fisted hard-boiled iron-jawed crimefighter.\nThe Mechanic: With pigtails sticking out of her aviator helmet, she carries an overlarge wrench - and we know what that\u2019s perfect for.\nIt\u2019s a casual game and takes about 20 minutes to half an hour. While it\u2019s very simple to learn, it can take a long time to master, and there is still the element of chance. Similar to something like backgammon in that regard. If backgammon had cloaked and hooded cultists trying to destroy the world if you lose.\n\u00a9 Michael Lee Macdonald\nOur lead artist for the project is Michael Lee Macdonald, aka Alchemicheal, who's work has been compared to the seminal master Mo\u00ebbius.\nOriginal music is being composed by Gil Luna, known for his kickstarter-fueled Cthulhu Rises soundtrack.

The series begins with Katie and Eric, two twenty-somethings who, while having problems in their relationship, accidentally become involved in the struggle between two factions of an ancient secret society, descended from Celtic and Roman gods.\nBook Two: Hallowstone. As Eric grieves the death of his lover, the flamboyant Heathcliff Weatherby Wednesday helps him find her killer. But in return, Heathcliff makes some unusual demands. As the mystery deepens, Eric grows unsure of who to trust.\nBook Three: Clan Fianna. Accused of a crime he didn\u2019t commit, Eric is banished from the Brigantians.

In 2013 I was a TED speaker, at TEDxGuelphU. And a previous Kickstarter project of mine, \"Clear and Present Thinking\", created a free college-level textbook on logic and critical thinking which is now used in many colleges and universities, including Canada's biggest: the University of Toronto.\nI'm a philosophy professor by day. So I know about power relations, and moral dilemmas, and the metaphysics of a believable and interesting fantasy world. I've also got a Drama degree, so I know about characterization, dramatic timing and tension, and the power of language and storytelling. I've put these skills together to create what I hope you will agree is a compelling and memorable series of novels.\nI like writing fantasy because good fantasy bends the rules of reality precisely to draw special attention to reality, and our real lives. Good fantasy can be full of magic spells, fantastic monsters, and amazing landscapes \u2013 but in the end it's really about people, confronting the natural immensities of fate and free will, reality and illusion, good and evil, life and death, and all things in between. Of course you can explore such things in any genre. But I just think it's interesting and fun to do that in fantasy. And that's what I'm doing with Fellwater.\nYou're a fan of science fiction, fantasy, and drama, and you prefer to support independent artists and creators.\nYou enjoy stories about conflicted heroes who don't necessarily get the girl in the end. (Sorry for the spoiler there.)\nYou're the kind of person who wonders, as some of these characters wonder, what the rat race is really for, and whether there's more to this life than what meets the eye.\nIf any of this sounds familiar, then I've got a series of books for you.\nA mock recruitment ad for one of the factions in the novels.\nThank you for your support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nVery few. Since the majority of backer rewards are delivered electronically, those rewards will not get lost in the mail. The print books will be drop-shipped directly from the printer, which reduces costs and hassles for me, and improves delivery time for you. \n\nI'm going to use CreateSpace.com as my printer. It's an Amazon company, so if it goes bankrupt, it will be because the entire internet has crashed, and we'll all have bigger problems than an unfulfilled Kickstarter campaign. \n\nAll the backer rewards are finished, and almost ready to go. They just need, well, a little editing. The audiobooks are not yet recorded, but I already have all the equipment that I need for the purpose. \n\nOne notable \"challenge\" is the fact that this campaign is set to end right in the middle of my exams. I will be up to my neck in marking papers for most of the month of May, and I'll have less time to work with the editor. But this is mostly a scheduling problem, not a logistical one. I've therefore set a delivery date of September 2014 for all backer rewards. But it's entirely possible that things will be done much sooner than that. Backers will be kept informed by frequent updates, and posts on my Twitter and Facebook pages.\n\nAnd if my editors disappear? I've a backup plan for that, too.

But where does Clive Barker find his primal inspiration?\nClive has said from his first interviews that he keeps a brush and ink next to his bed to capture fragments of dreams, and that his stories originate as visuals first- the works on canvas are more often than not Clive's inital introduction to the characters and universes that he then picks up a pen to illuminate.  The most recent example of this is his world of Abarat:\n\"I'm painting these pictures in the expectation that... interesting, strange characters and landscapes will come into my mind and into my mind's eye and appear on the canvas through the brush. There is something willfully strange about this process- that you stand back at the end of a night's work and you look at something and you say, 'Where did that come from?' I mean, I'm not the only artist who does that - lots of artists do that, I know. And it's been wonderful because if I had created Abarat from words- if I'd written Abarat and then illustrated it... it would not be anything like as rich or as complex or as contradictory a world as it is. Because this is a world which has been created from dream visions...  What I'm doing is finding stories that match the shape of my dreams.\"\nBook cover mockup.\nIMAGINER is the first comprehensive volume of the artwork of Clive Barker.  Featuring over 75 artworks and over 160 pages, the book will be a gorgeous large format of 10\" x 13\" inches.  There have been marginal explorations of Clive's artwork in the past, but the most important part of this project is that the book is composed of entirely ALL NEW and ULTRA HIGH RESOLUTION image captures.  The detail is impeccable, and Clive flatteringly declared the difference in detail of the new captures compared to previously printed ones like the difference between \"chalk and cheese\".  (Which means they're really, really good!)\nThe purest, most direct path from the raw creative mind of Clive Barker to our world is through his artworks.  We are in the process of exhuming and documenting a lifetime of genius; these artworks are the origin points of characters we recognize, and hold hints of stories yet to come.  We expect this first book to be the beginning of a series of volumes examining his work in great detail, and are also in the process of documenting his creative process on film for a documentary titled Clive Barker: Imaginer.\nThis is an art book of the highest quality, and is being created with the utmost attention to detail to present the artwork as though you were witnessing the paintings and drawings in person.\nWhat makes a \"fine art\" book?\nThe capturing of images is incredibly important- for this book we have used a high-resolution scanback camera with a Hasselblad lens; all artworks were carefully lighted, and are being painstakingly color corrected as we speak.  Many books that you see are 8.5\" x 11\" or smaller because it's a cutoff point for pricing.  The next plateau is 9\" x 12\".  The artwork of Clive Barker looks best printed in an even more dramatic 10\" x 13\" format- since we are going directly to the fans with this we can avoid the demands and concerns of mass-market publishing and print this book at a beautiful large format that shows the artwork in the best possible manner!\n\"The Believer\" Oil on paper.\nTHE REWARDS\nOn January 18, 2014 we begin the celebration of Clive's artwork with an exhibition at Century Guild gallery in Los Angeles, where Clive's artwork will be hanging amidst works by important Symbolists including Alphonse Mucha and Franz von Stuck, drawings from 19th century Austrian masters Gustav Klimt and Koloman Moser, and an impressive selection of German silent film and cabaret artworks.

Funds will also pay for travel and expenses, and for reward fulfillment. \n\nThe goal is to use half of the Kickstarter funds for content creation and the other half for the printing of books and Kickstarter incentive rewards. \n\nAdditional funding will allow me to find more experienced models, travel to more distant locations, and procure more elaborate props.\n\nCost breakdown of a sample shoot- approximately $300 per shoot\nModel - $100\nProp - $100\nLocation and permit - $50\nExpendables and other miscellaneous expenses - $50\nWith 12 photo shoots completed by the time of launch, PRIMAL has already cut $3,600 out of its minimum funding goal. With a minimum of 30 shoot sessions needed to complete the book, that leaves 18 shoots still to be funded, and a balance of $5,400. With half the Kickstarter funds going towards rewards, that is a minimum balance of $10,800 for the remaining shoots and production costs. This however does not directly equate to another shoot in the book for every $600 over the goal. \nI feel that 30 sessions is the minimum for a quality book with enough variation. The maximum however is constrained by scheduling, and limited to approximately 40. Simply put, more funding means more (and better) models, props, locations, and a better final product. \nStretch Goals\nAny additional funds raised beyond what is detailed above will go towards PRIMAL's stretch goals! At $12,000 PRIMAL will be able to hold a release gallery and party in Los Angeles at the completion of the project.  The extra money will go towards printing, location, and drinks. At $15,000 there will be some surprise goodies for absolutely everyone who participates, as well as 10 extra pages in the book! \n\nI also know how hard it has been for me to get this project going, and how hard it is for other artists. for this reason I am participating in kicking it forward. a percentage of the profits of this project will be funded back into other kickstarter projects!  \n\n\nREWARDS\n\nWith the exception of the limited quantity rewards, any reward can be added to any pledge level by pledging that reward's dollar amount above your pledge level. This can be used to purchase additional quantities or combine rewards that are not normally offered together. \n\nPlease contact me with any questions.\n\nAbout the book. \n\nThe finished product will be an 8\"x10\" softcover book with 50+ pages printed on premium luster archival photo paper for the richest colors and highest image quality. Printed by Blurb.  \n\nAlthough some images will appear online in the gallery and on social media, there will be many images in the book that will not appear anywhere else. \nAbout the prints.\n\nSome of the images are not suitable for all ages. To see the images as intended please follow this link to my site.  (NSFW)\n\nThe set of 5 framable 8x10s will consist of selected images that are the most iconic and most representative of the collection as a whole. \n\nThe prints will be made by ICON in Los Angeles at the end of 2014 after the final images have been selected. To add the prints to a pledge level that does not normally include them, add $150 to your pledge amount.\nPLAY", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are many elements that must come together to make this project successful. I\u2019m certainly not too prideful to admit that I can't do this all on my own.\n\nThe greatest challenge to realizing the best version of this project is the physical design of the book. I am confident in my ability to create photographs... but the same cannot be said for the writing and graphic design skills needed for the final product. Although I have done print-on-demand books before this one will be my biggest undertaking yet. I may need some help with the layout and design of the book but luckily I have many creative friends who are willing to help.\n\nAnother challenge I am currently experiencing is difficulty finding male models willing to shoot nude. This is something that will become easier the more sizable my budget becomes. Kickstarter funding is absolutely essential to make this the best project it can be.\n\n\nThank you, \n-Nicholas Freeman\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #13", "update_userinfo": "the time has come", "update_content": "All the books have arrived and I have begun printing all of the rewards and gallery pieces.

So please jump in now if you haven't yet, because it would break our hearts to see you live with that kind of regret.\nTHUMBNAIL SUMMARY OF UNLOCKED GOALS\nBALL PIT album of original songs, plus album art\nEXTRA BALLS album of cover song collaborations\n2 music videos for 2 of our brand-new songs\nRPG Soundboard App\nThe KS-exclusive and star-studded PaulandStormonomicon story and art anthology\nAnimated holiday special to be created in collaboration with Mike and Matt Chapman (The Brothers Chaps of homestarruner.com)\n(Holy crap!)\nWHO THE HECK ARE WE?\nWe are Paul and Storm, a comedy-music duo who've been writing and performing music together (and prior to that, as half of a cappella group Da Vinci's Notebook) for nearly 20 years. We perform across the US and internationally, and at numerous cons (such as PAX, PAX East, DragonCon and Emerald City ComicCon). We're co-founders of w00tstock (along with Wil Wheaton and Adam Savage), and we co-produce the annual Jonathan Coulton fan cruise JoCo Cruise Crazy. \nYou also might have seen our George R.R. Martin-themed music video, \"Write Like the Wind\":\nWe've independently recorded and released four albums as Paul and Storm; and in early 2013, we co-created, starred in, and wrote the songs for the musical webseries LearningTown for the Geek & Sundry YouTube channel.\nWHAT THE HECK ARE WE DOING?\nWe're nearly finished recording our fifth full-length album, Ball Pit; but rather than just finish it off and release it the way we usually do, we wanted to do...something more. With your help, we can make a spectacle of the release, and surround it with other, related cool projects to help make a real splash and hopefully garner some extra attention to the new release. Cool projects like professionally-produced music videos. Like a bonus EP with cover songs and collaborations. Like an RPG soundboard app. Maybe even an animated holiday special, a live concert video, or a video project of us going on tour in an ice-cream-and-guacamole truck. YES, AN ICE CREAM TRUCK. WITH GUACAMOLE.\nWe'd love to just go ahead and make all of these projects happen on our own; we've been thinking about several of them for quite some time. But the truth is that we're independent musicians with limited resources. With your support and funding, however, we can make every one of them a reality, which excites us beyond measure.\nTL;DR The more we raise, the more shenanigans and monkeyshines we'll be able to bring you as part of the Ball Pit rollout. Thusly...\nSee? But we're not just here to show you sophisticated graphs. Here are the specifics:\nBall Pit is mostly recorded, but the big cash costs occur when it's time to assemble it into a CD. So there's that. But more importantly, we want to make a whole bunch of Ball Pit-related stuff. So at our main goal, here's where the money will be going:\n1. Finishing Off Ball Pit\nFinal mixing, mastering, packaging, and physical production of Ball Pit. This includes funds paid to guest musicians, producers, and visual artists who help make the project sound and look great. Also, a modest amount for our own time and effort.\n2. Music Video for \"This Song\"\nWe want to make a kick-buttocks music video for \"This Song\", our most viral-worthy tune since \"Write Like the Wind (George R.R. Martin)\". Here's a sneak audio-peek of a couple excerpts from the song demo:\n(Bear in mind the final version will be EVEN MORE EPIC)\n\"This Song\" needs a video, but it needs one done right. As in, not recorded and edited on our smartphones. Even on a \"shoestring\" budget, a GOOD music video with a professional crew can cost quite a lot. (As in, low five-figures) We want to bring in people to help make it Not Suck At All\u2014specifically, director Sean Becker and producer Kim Evey (who both worked on LearningTown and The Guild)\u2014to lead a crew to make a music video worthy of your efforts to fund it.\n 3. Extra Balls Cover Songs EP\nOur main goal will fund a 5-song EP called Extra Balls, featuring cover songs recorded with a few of our musician friends (Jonathan Coulton, The Doubleclicks, Parry Gripp, Mike Phirman, and Sara Watkins), to be made available as a digital download.\n4. Ten New RPG Songlets\nA little while ago, we recorded a number of short songs (\"songlets,\" if you will) designed to be used while playing RPGs. They were very well received, and a couple of them will be included on Ball Pit. We want to make more of them; so when we reach our main goal, we'll record and (separately) release 10 more. Additional funding will mean writing and releasing additional RPG songlets, and potentially an RPG soundboard app if things go really well. (More on that later...)\n5. Kickstarter and Amazon Payments Fees\nThese account for 7-10% of every dollar we collect. Gotta pay The Man!\nAbout the new Ball Pit album\nIn addition to popular songs that haven't appeared on any album (like \"Write Like the Wind (George R. R. Martin)\" and \"Thanksgiving\") and a couple of the original RPG songlets, we have a bunch of brand new original songs that aren't yet available anywhere. And as a backer, you'll get these new songs FIRST, before the rest of the world has access.\nBONUS: The amazing and talented Randall Munroe (xkcd.com) has done the cover art. (!!!)\nDepending on your preference and reward level, you can receive Ball Pit as a physical CD, a download with pdf files of the album art and credits, or on a limited-edition USB flash drive. \nSo that's pretty great right there. But we want to go BIGGER and DO MORE STUFF. So if we exceed our goal, here's a look at what we're gonna do:\nHere comes the science...\nUPDATE 12/10/13: $80k reached! The book is officially happening!\nThe PaulandStormonomicon will be an anthology of very short stories and illustrations based on and/or inspired by Paul and Storm and their songs.\nThe PaulandStormonomicon will include contributions from the following authors:\nJames S. A. Corey (The Expanse series)\nGreg \"Storm\" DiCostanzo\nLev Grossman (The Magicians; The Magician King)\nMary Robinette Kowal (Shades of Milk and Honey; Without a Summer)\nSeanan McGuire (Blackout; Rosemary and Rue)\nMikey Neumann (Vena Cava; The Ending: An Apocalypse Part 1)\nPatrick Rothfuss (The Name of the Wind; The Wise Man's Fear)\nJohn Scalzi (Old Man's War series; Redshirts)\nScott Sigler (Infection Trilogy; Nocturnal)\n...and will include illustrations by:\nBill Amend (FoxTrot)\nJoel Hodgson (MST3k; Cinematic Titanic)\nScott Johnson (My Extra Life)\nMary Robinette Kowal (yup; an illustration too!)\nLen Peralta (Geek A Week)\nKatie Rice (Camp Weedonwatcha; Penny Arcade's Strip Search)\nKris Straub (Chainsawsuit, Broodhollow)\nZach Weiner (Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal)\nAnnie Wu (Venture Bros.; Batgirl)\nWil Wheaton\nand Neil Gaiman\nAnd the cover will be designed by Emily and Matt Fitzpatrick, the cross-stitching wizards behind Steotch.\nWe're hoping to add a few more names to the above lists before we're through. Watch this space...\nThe PaulandStormonomicon will become available in both paperback and ebook form (specific formats TBD; but we promise to try to make it available for all major ebook readers); it'll be available as an add-on ($10 digital version; $15 US /$18 INTL paperback; $20 US / $23 INTL P&S-signed paperback), and/or included in some higher Reward levels.\nThis collection of brand new works from all these great creators will ONLY be available to our Kickstarter backers\u2014once the campaign\u2019s done, this book will disappear back into the \u00c6ther. So act now!\nUPDATED 12/13/13: The Animated Holiday Special, co-created by, co-starring and animated by Homestarrunner.com's Mike and Matt Chapman, and co-written by us, the Brothers Chaps, and LearningTown head writer Josh Cagan, has been FUNDED!\nOur Kickstarter backers will be able to see and hear it before anyone else.\nYes! For years fans have asked us \"When are you going to do a song with [Person X]\", or suggested that \"You should totally do a cover of [Song Y]\". And you know what? We love Person X and Song Y, but it's never seemed quite right to do those things on our \"normal\" comedy albums. And even if we did, the logistics of coordinating such collaborations can be intimidating.\nWell, darnit, the time has come to stop dawdling and start making it happen. And so, with crowdfunding's help, Extra Balls will be born.\nUPDATE 12/02/13: New collaborators announced: MC Frontalot, Hank Green and John Scalzi! Current full list of Extra Balls collaborators:\nJim Boggia\nMarian Call\nChris Collingwood\nJonathan Coulton\nThe Doubleclicks\nMC Frontalot\nHank Green\nParry Gripp\nMolly Lewis\nMike Phirman\nJohn Roderick\nJohn Scalzi\nSara Watkins\nadditional collaborators TBA\nThe Extra Balls CD is now also available as an Add-On item to existing pledges, and comes free with the ALL-IN BUNDLE (and all higher rewards which receive the ALL-IN BUNDLE items).\nAs described above, we've previously recorded a few short \"songlets\" designed to be used while playing RPGs. Songs such as \"Critical Hit\" (Warning: NSFW!):\n ...and \"Don't Blow the Daily\" (NSFW)...\nThese have been very well-received, so we want to make more of them. We'll make 10 more upon reaching our main goal, and then more at the $30,000, $35,000, $40,000, $45,000 and $55,000 levels.\nAnd if we reach $65,000, we'll compile all these songlets into a smartphone app you can use in your own gaming sessions, or to just play on a whim wherever you go. (Like the library. Or jury duty. Or a funeral.)\nIt's something we've wanted to make for years, but we got sticker shock when we first saw what quality app development costs. But your funding will enable us to bring in professional developers and artists (who we already have lined up) to make this app as cool, efficient, beautiful and awesome as possible. If funded, the RPG app will be made available as an add-on reward to our Kickstarter campaign.\nBeyond the $65,000 threshold, the more funding we receive, the more songlets, taunts, sound effects, and features we'll add to the app. \nActual app will look way more awesome.\nUPDATE: UNLOCKED! App will have at least 75 sounds, and will be available for iOS and Android.\nThe reality these days is that if your song doesn't have a great video, it's just not gonna go very far. And we know lots of experienced, talented people who do exactly that sort of thing\u2014and with your help we'll be able to pay them to help us put together some more high-quality righteous videos. If funding is crazy-go-nuts, we might even produce videos for some of our pre-Ball Pit fan favorites.\nUPDATE 11/19/13: Thanks to your generosity, we have secured funding for a second music video. Watch the Updates for forthcoming information about that second song and video. \nAs noted above, our cover art for Ball Pit will be done by xkcd's Randall Munroe. But we know quite a few great artists; so we thought, why limit ourselves to just one cover?\nSo a number of stretch goals will unlock alternate Ball Pit cover art created by some of our talented friends:\n$35,000 - Adam Koford (HOBOTOPIA)\n$40,000 - John Kovalic (Dork Tower)\n$55,000 - Ethan Nicolle (AXE COP)\nUPDATE 11/19/13: All three Alternate Cover Art stretch goals have been unlocked! Poster versions of all cover art options are now available as Add-Ons (see chart below for full pricing information). All Ball Pit posters are now included for free in the ALL-IN BUNDLE reward and above (all rewards of $130 and up).\nYES! P&S go on tour in an ice cream truck, document it on video, and make something awesome with it!\nUPDATED 12/09/13: Stretch goal revised to $265,000! Also, Mediocrefilms' Greg Benson will be along both on-camera and behind the scenes to help document the trip and edit it into episodes. \nWhen it comes right down to it, we're not really in the music business. Our true value to society is in doing idiotic things that make other people laugh, smile, or generally feel good, and it just happens that music is our primary means of accomplishing that end.\nSo we have a dream for a Ball Pit tour that combines three of our loves: music, live performance, and FOOD. And if we reach the ludicrous stretch goal of $265,000, we will procure an ice cream truck, take it out on tour, give away ice cream and guacamole, do various good and/or ridiculous deeds (tbd), and document the whole adventure with a professional film crew.\nDo we expect to reach this goal? No. But if you don't dream big, chances are you won't go on tour in an ice cream (and guacamole) truck.\nFull reward details are of course in the right-hand sidebar; but below is a basic summary chart of the items contained in the different rewards, so you know exactly what stuff is included in each package (not counting the reward-specific \"special\" stuff, like the doodles, song review and such):\n*For the CRAPPY ANIMATION and BAND FOR HIRE rewards, subject matter must be non-commercial, and may not contain pornography, excessive profanity, hate speech, illegal or creepy stuff. P&S retain final subject matter approval, but will work with you to make sure we're all happy with the final product. P&S will retain all publishing rights, but you'll be free to use it in any non-commercial setting that you like.\nADD-ONS\nBelow is the list of currently-available add-ons for all reward levels (excluding HEARTY THANKS and HEARTIER THANKS). Please note that some rewards may already include one or more of these items:\nMore add-ons may be opened up at additional funding levels, so watch this space as the campaign progresses!\nTo add any of these items to your existing pledge, click on the \"Manage Your Pledge\" button, increase your pledge by the amount(s) listed above (for example, to add both the T-shirt and USB Drive, add $110 for US orders, $123 for international orders), select \"Continue to Next Step\" and confirm your new pledge. Once the campaign is over, we'll contact you to find out which item(s) your additional pledge was for.\nWHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?\nThe question often gets asked of Kickstarters (especially successful ones): \"Where exactly does the money all go?\" When this is over, will we be diving into piles of cash, all Scrooge McDuck-like?\nAnd so we present the chart below, which is a breakdown of where the funds we've collected up to the $65k stretch goal level will go, based on our current best possible budget estimates. (The amount actually going directly to us is the highlighted, sexy gray section.)\nWhile the percentages will vary somewhat if/when we collect more funds, we expect them to stay reasonably close to what's in this graph.\nWE LOVE TALKING ABOUT OUR KICKSTARTER\nBelow is a list of podcasts and interviews with us discussing Ball Pit and the Kickstarter campaign. You should listen to/read ALL OF THEM:\nAll Things Girl\nBourbon Lounge\nThe Daily Dot\nG2V Podcast\nThe Gamers Dome\nGeekloo\nThe Nerd Nighters\nNerd Reactor\nNerdy But Flirty\nNutty Bites\nRed Dwarf Introcast\nThe Quadruple Z\nVERY SPECIAL PITCH VIDEO SPECIAL THANKS GO TO...\nSean Becker for editing together our magnificent pitch video\nJonathan Coulton, Drew Westphal and Patrick Rothfuss for being really, really smart\nWil Wheaton for being our reasonably-tolerant DM\n8th Dimension Comics & Games for the sweet gaming setup", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've been successfully delivering music (digitally and physically), merchandise, videos, and so forth for almost two decades; and we organize complex events like w00tstock and JoCo Cruise Crazy. So we feel pretty confident that we'll deliver on everything in our Kickstarter, including (especially?) the crazier elements. In the unlikely event that we actually raise $350,000, do we know exactly where we'd get an ice cream truck? No. But we have a good track record for figuring out those sorts of things.\n\nThat said, we're just two people made of flesh and blood, and are subject to the same cataclysms as other carbon-based lifeforms, as are our collaborators. It's also possible that unforeseen obstacles may hinder delivery of some of the project elements. We can't imagine what, but such is the nature of the unforeseen.\n\nBut at the heart of it all, we hope that this entire process will bring you great joy, and that the resultant output of content will bring us wider renown, thereby increasing your satisfaction in supporting us before Everybody Else got in on the act.

Siuda", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "What if the gods and heroes of ancient times were only human beings, just like you?\nWhat if the faeries and monsters and spiritual beings of mythology, from every culture and nation, were actually people like you and me - but a little faster, a little stronger, a little wiser, than the rest of us?\nWhat if time and history expanded the stories of their lives, transforming them into myth and legend - transforming them into gods? \nWhat if such people still walk among us?\nAnd what if you are one of them?\nIt's an urban fantasy trilogy of mythology, conspiracy, and meaning.\nAnd it's a tabletop role-play game, based on the novels.\nA little background:\nI've always enjoyed inventing games. In my teens and early 20's I created my own video games on my Commodore 128. Back in 1996 I started writing my own tabletop fantasy role-play game. I would open the document every three or four months, write or edit a page or three, and then close it again for another few months.\nThe result of having done that for nearly twenty years is that I now have an almost-complete game, 286 pages long. It's time to finish the game once and for all, and let it loose in the world.\nThis summer, while writing the third novel in my Fellwater series, it occurred to me that with a few intelligent changes, the game could take place in the same world as the novels. All I have to do now is modify the rules to fit the story, and then publish it. I\u2019ve got a network of wonderful people who are ready to help me illustrate, edit, design, promote, and test it. But I wouldn\u2019t ask any of these people to work for me for free. Hence, I have come to you with this fundraising project.\nWhat's unique about the game?\n1. It's based on the world of a well-regarded series of modern fantasy novels.\nIts heroes are caught in a conflict between rival factions of a secret society, whose members are descended from ancient gods. While dealing with their own personal problems, they also struggle to protect Fellwater Grove, one of the last remaining places on earth where the magic of the Mythic Age still survives. The 'Secret People' of the 'Hidden Houses', as they are called, compete with each other for control of such places, just as political factions in the real world compete for control of sea ports, oil fields, and markets.\nReviewers on Amazon and other places have favourably compared the novels to the work of Neil Gaiman and George R.R. Martin. The first book in the series was praised by Jordan Stratford, one of Kickstarter's top-ten all-time highest fundraisers in book projects!\n2. The rules are designed to maximize character customization.\nTo create a new character in this game, players choose between one of five 'sources' or general world views, one of thirteen 'lineages' or cultural backgrounds, and one of seven 'paths' or occupations (comparable to \"class\"). This makes 455 possibilities - more, if players invent their own lineages. Furthermore, it's a skill-based system in which characters can advance in more than one path at the same time; in fact, characters can advance in all seven paths simultaneously. So, there's actually 3,185 possibilities! And characters advance in their path by learning talents associated with that path, like a skill tree, but in almost any sequence they wish. So the true range of possibilities for customization is almost impossible to calculate.\nWhy should you back this project?\nBecause you love mythology, heroism, adventure, fairy tales and weird science. You think that despite the rat race of modern times there is still a place in the world for imagination, discovery, heroic excellence, and childhood wonder. You want to explore and protect and indeed create that place.\nIf those statements ring true for you, then I've got a game for you. And a trilogy of novels, too. And some wonderful art. And a community of people who love these things just as much as you do.\nWhat will my contribution pay for?\nYour contribution will allow me to finish writing the text of the game, and it will pay for the work of a whole team of artists, designers, and contributors.\nThe artists include Morpheus Ravenna, Seb Barnett, \u00c9milie Sonia-Boisvert, Kelfae Flowers, Heather Matz, Courtney Sciba, and Laurie Foster-McLeod. Many of the images in the video above come from their portfolios. 47% of the budget for this project is for art. So if games aren't your thing, you can support these wonderful artists!\nFor the design elements, I'll be working with Winter-Hebert, who also designed my \"Clear and Present Thinking\" project.\nKimberly Ross, a professional editor who specializes in academic and scientific writing, will work with me as editor.\nBeta-testing and other system-related contributions will come from the team at Arcana Creations.\nThe proposed budget and production timeline can be seen in the FAQ, below.\nWhat will the finished product be?\nA tabletop fantasy role-play game, with over 60 awesome illustrations and a professional design. The game will be produced in two volumes:\n\u2022 A \"Basic\" rulebook with most of the core rules, an introduction to the world of The Fellwater Tales, and some notes about how to adapt the rules to other fantasy or sci-fi environments.\n\u2022 A \"Complete\" rulebook with all the core rules and all the optional and expanded rules, a complete descriptions of all the talents, powers, and spells that characters can use, a full account of the world of the Fellwater Tales, and a bank of NPC's, adventure scenarios, and other resources with which to build a full campaign.\n\u2022 A small web site will be created, to allow people to explore the world of the game, and its system.\n\u2022 We will also create a few accessories, such as character sheets, quick-reference pages, and compatibility notes for popular game engines such as d20,and Pathfinder.\nI know about writing, gaming, storytelling, and publishing. Here's why.\nI am the author of thirteen books, mostly nonfiction titles, including the Fellwater novels, and \"Iron Age\", a tabletop strategy game of power, honour, and democracy. I'm also a professor of philosophy and humanities at CEGEP Heritage College in Gatineau, Quebec. This is my second Kickstarter project: my first was the highly successful \"Clear and Present Thinking\" project which created a free college textbook in logic and critical reasoning. \nThe interesting thing about having an M.A. and Ph.D in philosophy is that I understand logic, algorithms, cosmology and metaphysics, political theory and strategy, and the principles of mathematical game theory \u2013 perfect for designing an RPG system, as well as the larger world views and conflicts in which the characters find themselves. For example, characters in my game must choose a \u201cSource\u201d, from which they draw their powers, and from which they gain a large part of their sense of identity. It may look at first like a D&D-style alignment system. But the Sources are not just five stations on a spectrum between good and evil. Rather, they are five different world views: five competing models of human nature, good and evil, truth and beauty; five equally-strong answers to all the big questions.\nAt the same time, from my B.A. in Drama, I also understand narrative arcs, dramatic tension, imagination, performance art, and free creative play \u2013 perfect for world building, character design, and the like. My fiction writing is inspired by the playwriting and directing work I did as a drama student: I apprenticed for a short while under a playwright who won the Governor General\u2019s award for literature. So I know about storytelling.\nOn top of that, I\u2019ve also undertaken a lifelong study of mythology and folklore \u2013 I\u2019ve even published several books on the topic \u2013 which is helpful for all those things I've mentioned here, and more.\nA final note: Games are good for us.\nGames help us develop all kinds of skills, from hand-eye coordination to strategic planning. They help us build empathy with team-mates, and they can encourage the kind of competition that leads to excellence. Games can even be used to explain social justice issues, or to assist people recovering from illnesses. (I tip my hat to developers like Jane McGonigal and Brenda Brathwaite here.) And, of course, games are fun! I've invented several games for use in my classroom as teaching tools, one of which, \"Iron Age\", became so popular my students encouraged me to publish it. This project is a continuation of my pedagogical games, but on a larger scale.\nI also think that storytelling games like this one are important, too, because it's through storytelling that we explore and experiment with answers to life's most important questions. Here I'm thinking of philosophers like MacIntyre and Ricoeur.\nI've had a lot of fun writing this game over the years, and I want to share that fun with you.\nSo, come and play in my back yard!\nAnd thank you for your support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAt this time, I've put together an excellent team of artists, designers, and contributors. But they live in far-flung distant corners of the world, from Canada to Australia, and various places in between. And as you can see, they all have slightly different artistic styles and interests. Similarly, some of the backer rewards allow backers to participate in the creation of the game. I will have to navigate the project in a field of multiple influences and voices - a challenging task, indeed!\n\nFrom my first Kickstarter campaign I learned how cost over-runs and time requirements are hard to predict, and always go higher than predicted. All the members of the team, including me, have regular jobs and lives, and we'll have to work on this project in our spare time. So it's always possible that unexpected events in life will get in the way.\n\nMy job will be to act as a kind of \"director\", as one might find in theatre or in film, ensuring a smooth production process, and ensuring the artistic integrity and completeness of the final product. \n\nI also have a list in my back pocket of others who I can call upon to work with me, if anyone from the current team is unable to participate any longer. For instance, in my last project, a contributor backed out in the middle of production because his wife had a baby. Back then, I didn't have anyone to replace him but myself; I have a few more people now. But there's also a lot I can do on my own, if I have to. Having self-published the novels on which the game is based, I have all the resources I need to do my own interior layout and design, for instance. (Although I'd rather bring a professional into the project to handle that part of the work.)\n\nI don't anticipate any problems of a technical nature. For my previous Kickstarter project, and my self-published novels, I used Amazon Createspace as the printer and distributor. I'll be using it again for this project, too. I also have an account with Library & Archives Canada, so I can issue my own ISBN's, and so I anticipate no delays there. But if anything of a technical nature were to interrupt the project, I have scouted some excellent local printers and bookbinders who I can work with instead.\n\nI will keep the backers completely informed about the production process at all times, and with complete transparency. If anything really unpredictable happens to slow down the project (internet failure, alien abduction, or a shortage of coffee), you'll know, and you'll know what we're doing about it.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Brendan Myers\n6 created \u00b7 46 backed\nI'm a philosophy professor, and the author of seventeen books in fiction and nonfiction, including the four-part fantasy series \"Fellwater...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #4", "update_userinfo": "Hidden Houses: Where Game of Thrones meets the Brothers Grimm", "update_content": "Good evening,\nTwo years ago, you supported my effort to create a tabletop RPG based on my urban fantasy fiction series: \"Fellwater: The Hidden Houses\".\nTonight, it is my pleasure to say I am attempting the project again.

Looking to stay out of trouble, the trio decides to spend some time relaxing on the shores of Leviathan Lake. Sirens, Kappas, Nymphs, Kelpies - what could possible go wrong? But when something ancient arises from the lake's bottomless depths, it becomes clear that someone - or something - is attempting to sabotage the entire camp!\nVisit www.campmyth.com for more information on Camp Myth, and be sure to \"Like\" the series on Facebook at www.facebook.com/campmyth and follow it on Twitter at www.twitter.com/campmyth.   \n(Artwork by Jay Camay, coloring by Lisa Moore)\nWhat Makes Camp Myth Unique?\nFrom the beginning, I wanted Camp Myth to give readers a unique way to connect with the series. Since the overall theme is about celebrating cultural and racial diversity, I paired with an amazing artist, Jay Camay, and gave fans (or, in this case, backers) the opportunity to design their own mythic campers, which were then featured as illustrations in the book.    \nThe response was absolutely incredible! Book One saw fourteen people from across four continents create Minotaurs, Centaurs, Kitsune, Sirens, and everything in between! It was amazing to correspond with those backers and watch their ideas come to life, and I can't wait to do it again!\nYou can check out the entire illustration gallery RIGHT HERE.   \nOx the Minotaur & Natious the Cyclops (backer-designed characters!)\nRewards\nThere are a few new additions to the reward tiers for this campaign, and I'm excited to explain some of the major changes.\nPersonalized copies of Kraken Fishing are only $20!-In addition to an ebook copy of Phoenix Watching, a wallpaper of the Kraken Fishing cover, early access to Kraken Fishing in all ebook formats, and your name listed on the Camp Roster (Thank You Section), you'll also receive a signed softcover of Camp Myth: Kraken Fishing - all for just twenty bucks! And you'll also be eligible for all of the awesome stretch goals as they unlock!\n*NEW* Camper Portraits!\n-Want an inexpensive way for you (or someone you know) to have your own mythic camper featured in the book? The $40 tier introduces \"Camper Portraits\" to the series! These quarter-page illustrations will let you choose from 10 potential mythic races, and design them by selecting styles from a survey list of five groups of features: Eyes, Nose, Mouth, Hair, and Expression.\nYour name will be featured underneath the portrait, and you'll be placed with other backers to form \"Camp Clubs.\" Think of it like yearbook photos, only you'll be a member of the Dryad Gardening Committee or the Centaur Bowling Team.\nFor example, here are three different Minotaurs that Jay illustrated from three unique surveys:\nFriendly, Sporty, and Bully Minotaurs.\n(For a complete list of Races/Traits, check out the F.A.Q at the bottom of this page.)     \nFull-Page Camper Illustrations!\n-Returning from Phoenix Watching, these gorgeous full-page scenes will feature a camper of your design having fun (or facing danger) on the campground. I will work with you in bringing your vision to life, and the character will be illustrated and featured in Kraken Fishing!

Aside from Felix, Argee, and Moxie, the other campers are backer-created characters from Book One, who now have a permanent place in Camp Myth history - directly on the cover!\nThis reward will guarantee your camper a place on the cover of Book Three, most likely doing something awesome with an enchanted bow that shoots all types of magical arrows! If you like what you see of all the artwork featured on this campaign page, act now, because this tier is limited to just five backers.   \nStretch Goals\nSince the first campaign, I've gained a much better understanding of the costs and logistics involved with designing, creating, and distributing all kinds of reward items, and also where I could have saved time and resources. As it stands right now, I feel that $3000 is the amount needed to launch the next volume of Camp Myth (taking into account art, design, editing, production, distribution, etc.) but that's without any of the awesome bonuses that I'd like to make to really turn Kraken Fishing into something special.\nCollectable Merit Badge Pins-I'm a huge fan of the merit badge collection aspect of Camp Myth, and want to provide readers with a unique item that can be associated with each volume. That's why, from here on out, I'd love to have every book come with a collectable pin based on the titular merit badge.\nKraken Fishing Merit Badge... In Pin Form!\nI'm extremely excited about the possibility of having these pins associated with the series from now on, and hope to have the opportunity to create them for all of you.\nBut wait, what about Phoenix Watching? Worry not! Hitting the right stretch goals will allow me to also produce that merit badge pin, and you'll be caught up with both Camp Myth adventures so far.\nExclusive \"Skyfire\" Merit Badge Pin!\nUPDATE: Starting today, anyone who makes a $50+ donation to both Camp Myth: Kraken Fishing and Jess Owen's novel, \u201cSkyfire\u201d will also receive a limited edition merit badge pin for GRYFON TAMING, featuring Shard, the main character in the Song of the Summer King series. The badge will be based on this design, and made in the same style and quality as the other collectable merit badge pins.\nGryfon Taming Merit Badge\nCamp Myth Bonus Novellas\n-I've had a lot of fun ideas for additional Camp Myth stories over the past year, and I think it's the perfect time to explore some of these concepts.\nThat's why I've added four novellas to the Stretch Goals list: Campfire Tales, Camp Myth's Got Talent!, A History of Camp Myth (by Asterion the Minotaur), and A Walking Tour of Camp Myth (by Loam the Golem). I'll unveil more information if we approach these goals. For now, here's cover for Campfire Tales:\nCamp Myth: Campfire Tales\nCamp Myth: Life After Kickstarter\nIt's been a wild ride for Camp Myth since the first Kickstarter campaign last summer.

Jay was taking some well-deserved time off, so I enlisted the help of a programmer and a new artist to try a new spin on the camp art style. A few months later, Camp Myth: iOS was released for free on iPhone/iPad, with the 8-part story, Hydra Raising.

As a huge gamer myself, how could I refuse? I worked closely with 3EG to help bring the flavor, story, characters, and locations of the camp grounds to life, and the result was a game that I'm extremely proud of. In fact, I've spent hours just messing around with the character creation system, and have had a blast just designing new campers. The PDF version of the game was just released last month, with the actual books being printed right now.\nIf you or anyone you know enjoys a good tabletop adventure, why not CHECK OUT CAMP MYTH: THE RPG!   \n\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly suited to children but also fun for adults.

Well, I've been featured in nearly two dozen publications \u2013 both online and print \u2013 including Nelson Literacy 8 (the current 8th Grade Language Arts textbook for Newfoundland and Labrador).

It's sponsored by the award-winning nonprofit The Center for Investigative Reporting.\nIt\u2019s like TurboTax for government records. We\u2019re streamlining the complicated process of filing and tracking public record requests, putting all of the steps, rules, exceptions and best practices in one place and allowing users to track requests on dashboards, receive alerts, share request blueprints and get social support and expertise from the FOIA Machine community. \nThis new platform is open and free for anyone, from citizen groups to reporters, the public, commercial media and educators. And it can be used to extract documents no matter the issue \u2013 human rights, the environment, political reform, public safety, privacy and more.\nIf this sounds like a smart idea to you, you\u2019re not alone. At last count, almost 800 reporters have signed up to start using FOIA Machine when it launches publicly. The seed money for the project ($47,000) was provided by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. \n\u201cFOIA Machine will aid journalists and private citizens in accessing millions of important governmental documents around the world that are covered by freedom of information laws which exist in more than 90 countries.\u201d  \u2013 The Knight Foundation, announcing its 2012 funding for the prototype \u201cto advance innovation in media and journalism\u201d \nSo what's left to do before launch?\nWhen we started this project in late 2012, it was called BirdDog and we thought it was only going to collect statistics on government response times to public records act requests. With the support of the Knight Foundation, we were able to expand our scope to include sending and generating information requests. \nOver the next few months, we built out new features and tested them in the newsroom of CIR until we had a workable prototype, now called FOIA Machine.\nToday, FOIA Machine can generate, edit and send requests to government agencies fairly well. It's useable but it's not ready for the general public.\nFOIA Request screen shot\nStarting a FOIA request\nPicking a topic\nThat's where Kickstarter comes in: we're asking for your help to finish development, improve design and pay for servers and data curation. \nWe have 15 users currently sending real freedom of information requests through FOIA Machine, but almost 800 people are still waiting to use it. And when we launch, that number will grow. \nHere's what we need to do to open this up to everyone:\nWe need to build a notification system to tell users when an agency responds to a request and to notify users when they need to follow up on outstanding requests.\nWe want to better track requests sent using FOIA Machine, allow users to override the status of a request, and then add data if they choose to follow up with an agency outside of FOIA Machine.\nWe need to expose more permissions so users can share their requests with whomever they want to.\nOur designer will help smooth over some of the user interface quirks.\nFOIA Machine lives on data and we need to continue adding into the database laws and information on government agencies that we're missing.\nWe need $55 - $150 per month, depending on traffic demands, for servers and a database.\nUsers will need a page to change their passwords and update their account information. We'll build that!\nOh, and it'd be great to get rid of bottlenecks that would stop us from expanding when FOIA Machine is used heavily.\n\nGot more questions? See our FAQ at the bottom of this page and read Update #3 to see what we plan to do with the extra funding beyond our initial Kickstarter goal.\nWho are we? \nFOIA Machine is currently housed at CIR (more about us in a minute) and is being built by a team of people working at a variety of news organizations:\nDjordje Padejski is FOIA Machine's founding director and community manager. He is a founder of Serbia\u2019s Center for Investigative Reporting and was a 2012 Knight Journalism fellow at Stanford University.\nShane Shifflett is FOIA Machine's developer and a data reporter at The Huffington Post. Before that, he was a data reporter for CIR. \nMichael Corey, a news applications developer for CIR, is an advisor to FOIA Machine and occasionally contributes code to the project.\nCoulter Jones is FOIA Machine's project manager and a data journalist at WNYC. Before that, he was an investigative reporter for CIR specializing in data analysis. \nDavid Suriano is CIR's master of user interface design. He is working to make sure FOIA Machine looks good and is easy to use.\nThe FOIA Machine advisory group includes Chase Davis of The New York Times, David Herzog of the University of Missouri, T. Christian Miller of ProPublica, and Martha Mendoza of the Associated Press.\nCIR has taken on FOIA Machine because we believe that journalism that moves citizens to action is an essential pillar of democracy. To correct injustices, people need to know what's really happening. FOIA Machine is all about bringing previously hidden information to light. \nBased in the San Francisco Bay Area, CIR\u2019s reporters, editors, producers and data analysts produce deep investigative stories that make an impact. CIR\u2019s staff are experts at using freedom of information laws for investigations into important issues such as the mistreatment of U.S. veterans, abuse in state hospitals, incompetence and corruption at the U.S. border, and charity fraud. \nWe are the only nonprofit journalism organization in the country with the in-house ability to produce stories on every available media platform \u2013 from print to video, radio and interactive data applications \u2013 making our reporting accessible and engaging and presented for maximum impact. We have worked with more than 300 news outlets, including FRONTLINE, ABC, Univision, Al-Jazeera English, The Young Turks, Stars and Stripes, the San Francisco Chronicle, KQED, NPR, The Daily Beast, CNN, YouTube and more. \nCIR is home to FOIA Machine until it is ready to go public (that\u2019s where you come in!), when it will be handed over to the national, nonprofit Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE), which offers its hundreds of members around the world access to its extensive resource center, conferences and specialized training. \nWhat\u2019s this about a match for my Kickstarter gift? \nIRE is based at the University of Missouri, which is also home to the Donald W. Reynolds Journalism Institute. The Institute generously offered to match all Kickstarter contributions up to $15,000, enough to launch FOIA Machine publicly. \n\"FOIA Machine is a tool that will have immediate and powerful benefits for all news organizations,\" said Randy Picht, the institute\u2019s executive director. \"We're excited to help get the project finished and into the hands of reporters and editors.\" \nNow that we've exceeded that goal, the Knight Foundation is offering CIR an additional $10,000 grant if we get to 2,000 backers on Kickstarter.\nWhy should humans help build FOIA Machine? \nFOIA became law July 4, 1966 \u2013 and it\u2019s been fighting for its life ever since. Presidents and Congress have tried to make it harder to use. Sometimes they\u2019ve been successful; sometimes they haven\u2019t. State sunshine laws frequently come under attack as well. CIR and FOIA Machine will help keep the laws strong by using them tenaciously and teaching others how to do the same. Now that you\u2019ve celebrated the Fourth of July with sparklers and picnics, declare your independence from government secrets \u2013 help us launch FOIA Machine. Not only will you feel good about helping to strengthen the democratic process, but you'll receive some pretty cool rewards to help you fly your freedom of information flag.\nFOIA Machine Stress Reliever\nFOIA Machine Tote Bag\nJ.

They can be used for everything from Blackjack to 52-Card Pickup, and are pretty much guaranteed to turn a crappy, rainy-day waiting room game of Gin Rummy into a full-scale blood-drenched slugfest with the fate of the planet hanging in the balance.\nFrom Shaka Zulu to George S. Patton, these hard-hitting premium playing cards depict real-life warriors, explorers, and various other eccentric murderlicious maniacs from every corner of the world and every period of history. Each comes with an awesome quote and every card will be hand-illustrated by our amazing stable of artists.\nWhen we reach our main funding goal, the Royals and Aces will all have a full on depiction of the Badass in all their glory. The numbered cards will still be sweet, but they will be full-color portraits of some intense Badass faces.\nWhen we hit the stretch goal we have artists standing by to give you EVERY card and EVERY Badass in full-on full-color beast mode with some appropriate inappropriate backgrounds.\nthe art isn't even finished and you already know you need to have it\nThe amount of death and destruction caused by the people on this list is more than some countries can claim, and the sheer weight of their cojones could sink the U.S.S Flagg like Shipwreck on a bender.\nYou can even play Crazy 8's with some of the most insane Badasses that ever existed\nGot twenty-five years or so to think about the consequences of a few poorly-timed, ultra-violent life decisions?

FishBird is a big departure in style for both musicians. This summer FishBird will tour, going to Brushwood Folklore Center in Sherman, New York, where we will record several concerts to create a live CD. The CD will be professionally recorded, and well mastered, and will become commercially available as an indy recording.

With any live show there is the very slim chance that recordings will be less than perfect, but we have worked with Brushwood's sound techs for many years, and they have never failed us.

Everyone's calendar will include three original comics!\n$10,000: ACHIEVEMENT ACHIEVED! The calendar will include another three original comics! That's six total original comics!\n$15,000: ACHIEVEMENT ACHIEVED!  Sick of only hurricanes getting official names (and winter storms getting unofficial names)?

Sick of everyone trying to impress you with their word-of-the-day that they learned and are now trying to work into every conversation? Well, each page of the calendar will now include a rudimentary word-of-the-day, like \"house\" or \"cat\" or \"ball\" or \"eat\", to give you the perfect complementary response to your annoying co-worker!\n$20,000: ACHIEVEMENT ACHIEVED!  Each page of the calendar will include a new fake international holiday for you to celebrate, giving you a new back-up reason to party every night!\n$22,500: ACHIEVEMENT ACHIEVED! Each calendar will include a total of 12 original comics! One for each month!\n$25,000: Each calendar will have a soundtrack listing included, with a different song named to accompany every single page!\nHello there! Grab a seat, let's get class started, and I'll tell you what this is all about.\nPage-a-day calendars.  Whoa!\nWait, wait, start at the beginning.\nI'm Dr. Dante Shepherd.  For the past five years, I've been producing Surviving The World, a daily photocomic with a chalkboard and labcoat and lessons touching on just about everything (science, literature, creeping people out, you name it).  The comic is a mix of humor and education combined with complete destruction of the fourth wall.\nSTW has been used in classrooms as a teaching material, for a wedding proposal, as a daily mantra, and it's funny, too!\nSo why page-a-day calendars?\nReaders have been asking for some kind of STW collection for years.  The format of the comic traditionally is presented as stand-alone content, so the comics would fit seamlessly into the page-a-day format.  Further, there are close to 1800 comics in the STW archive at this point, so there's a wide range to select the best material from.\nMeanwhile, instead of getting the '365 Days of Cats\" yet again, you can relive those fond memories of the classroom!  You know, the times when you weren't suffering chalkdust torture.\nWhat else is great about these calendars?\nYou would get 365 days of content.  You get a ready means of sharing different pages with friends and co-workers - an easy way to get introduced to STW or to introduce someone else to it.  You could potentially rip off every page and decorate your cubicle like a calendar mathematic John Nash.  Further, all pages will be printed in color!  How great is that?\nAnd to thank you for your contribution to the campaign, there are number of pretty cool rewards available at the different tiers, many of which will only be available through this Kickstarter.  These rewards may even increase your happiness, which, hey, who doesn't want that?\nWhat are some of these great rewards?\nBesides the calendar?  Alright, let's talk about them!\nFirst and foremost, anyone who donates will be recognized on the Surviving The World site as a member of the Dean's List, where you'll also be given a nickname for your fellow classmates to call you by (if you so choose or whatever).  Because, hey, everyone who helps is helping, so thanks!\nIf you get a calendar as part of this Kickstarter, you will also receive a STW report card which you can use to either grade yourself or someone you know!  This will only be available as part of the Kickstarter, so if you'd like to get one, you need to get your calendar early.\nThere are new STW prints (available only through the Kickstarter campaign) that will be signed/personalized, and at higher levels, individual slate blackboards that can be personalized, too.\nWhat about velociraptors?  Talk to us about dinosaurs, we think they are awesome.\nWhat about them? Oh, you mean velociraptor impressions like this one, based on suggestions from the audience?  Well, yes!  Everyone who donates $75 and higher will receive a USB drive shaped like a dinosaur, full of videos of velociraptor impressions.  A velociraptor who is watching Jurassic Park in the theater and is upset at the depiction of his own kind, a velociraptor who is running for political office, a velociraptor prom . . . all the best, some potentially based on your suggestions.\nThe USB that could hold all the velociraptor impressions you ever wanted\nThose sound pretty great!  But what else?\nWell, for a limited few, I will actually handcraft wooden mallets that you can use to play Thor or do whatever non-violent mallet thing you'd like to do.  I have treasured the one I've had for over a decade (even brought it to class throughout college, just because I could; perhaps it would look great in your office?) and I bet you would love one, too.\nStop! Mallet time.\nI've also done a stand-up-storytelling session at a number of colleges, and would be happy to deliver your calendar and other goods directly to you (if you live in the continental United States) and do a session in your region.\nWhat if we want to make you suffer?\nWell, one person can force me to break my New Year's Resolution not to eat any raisins (because I hate raisins; this was a sound resolution) by making me eat a pound of raisins.  But only one person, because I like living.\nAnything else?\nActually, yes!  There are a number of STW items which you can directly choose to include as a reward if you add it on to your backing tier.  These can include additional calendars as well.\nFirst, select the reward tier that you're interested in, with the amount necessary to support the campaign at that tier.  Then, make your donation an additional amount to reflect the add-on item that you wanted.  This will cover the shipping of both items, too.  The pricing for the add-on items are as follows:\nExtra calendar = $25 \nSTW labcoat = $36 \nA signed labcoat  = $45 \nA Happiness pint glass = $10 \nSet of four pint glasses = $35 \n200 Proof Coffee coffee mug = $13.50 \n\nHow do we know you can pull this off?\nThat's a fair question!  All I am is a lowly chemical engineering professor, and if you wanted me to define fugacity (a real, not actually made-up term although it certainly sounds like it should be), I'd be much better at that than I would be at assembling everything I've described.\nWhich is why this campaign will be working hand-in-hand with Topatoco and their Make This Thing division!  They've helped handle the assembly and shipping of several previous Kickstarter campaigns, and have done an excellent job of it.  So you know your goods will be in topnotch hands!\n\nOk, I wasn't paying attention.  You said 'class' and I zoned out.  Can you summarize?\nPage-a-day calendars made with comics from Surviving The World.  You'll love them.  Thanks for your support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe general design of the calendar is complete, and much of the additional material has already been prepared.

Benin City is special to me as it is also the site of my initiation into the mysteries of Olokun more than 25 years ago. While in Benin City I will photograph the groundwritings of Olokun priests who have extensive knowledge of and practice using Olokun\u2019s symbols in spiritual, artistic and secular contexts \n Groundwriting practices are found in many spiritual and cultural traditions. One form of groundwriting is the Hindu or Buddhist mandala. Mandalas are geometric patterns and symbology that are used to create focus, to induce meditation or trance or to create sacred space. This is also true for the practice of groundwriting to the Orisa. Like Mandalas groundwriting is ephemeral.  Whether sand, chalk, leaves or other natural materials are used;  groundwriting is meant to strike an immediate chord, instigate a flash of insight, send a message, solidify a connection with spirit, humans or nature, or to provoke healing -- then disappear. The work has been done instantly; communication has been delivered and received. \n My project will focus on the symbology and groundwritings of Orisa Olokun, the divinity of the deep sea and his messengers.  In Edo and Yoruba cosmology and indigenous spirituality, Orisas are forces in nature. Orisa Olokun is the bringer of wealth in all forms and considered a portal for mystic vision and transformation.  Symbols are applied to the ground with a sacred white chalk called Efun. The symbols and the arrangement of these symbols represent cosmic phenomena, or invoke communication between humans and the divinities. \n My project will culminate in a coffee table book that will demonstrate  how we can work with Olokun\u2019s symbols to bring us into closer relationship with our deepest desires and inspire our art and creativity. Groundwriting to the Orisa will include pictures of groundwriters as they work and offer explanations of what the groundwritings communicate and evoke.  The book will include interviews with ground writers and other artist who use and are inspired by Olokun\u2019s symbology. I am honored to have these artists join me. \n With this project I hope to broaden and deepen our understanding of Olokun. This book will be meaningful to those who are familiar or those unfamiliar with Olokun and the Orisas, to artists who use symbols to inform their work and to cultural historians and enthusiasts.\nAs I said before, Kickstarter is an all or nothing campaign.  This phase of the project costs $4000.  The entire project (book design, lay-out, production and distribution) will exceed $15,000.00  This is my beginning. I look forward to sharing my insights and progress with you all.  Your generous gifts are greatly appreciated.\nAse", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest obstacle for Phase 1 of this project is the weather. It sounds funny but wind and rain are my biggest concern because of the season. I will be in Nigeria late July and August but it is Winter in Africa; the rainy season. That said, I will rely on my fellow artist to select the best times for our groundwriting experiences and keep a rigorous schedule during daylight hours. Since groundwriting is not meant to last in its original form, I am not overly worried about getting what I need. I am taking photographs as well as others documenting the work. Once I am back in the States, the best pictures will be selected and developed immediately. Backers for phase 1 of the project will get their rewards as scheduled. \n\nPhase 2 of my project includes book design, layout and production. Phase 2 will require another funding effort because a high quality (glossy, heavy paper, vivid color) coffee table Art book can be costly. I want to assure all those that supported Phase 1 of the project that I am actively seeking other funding sources, a publisher and hope to have the book in print by Spring of next year.

As a player the decisions you made had a direct impact on how you played the game. Additionally, over-the-top personalities, memorable characters and role-playing elements made the games difficult to put away once you were hooked. \nBelow we have listed some of the major game features we are planning to implement: \nThe game text will be localized to English, French, German, Italian, Russian and Spanish.\nWe will give you a choice of distribution, always including a DRM-free option, for both the core game and future expansions.\nOur target platform is PC and the game will be available for Windows, Mac OSX and Linux. \nWith flashback we want to take you back to the cold war era and let you play the events that lead up to the founding of the international mercenary organization called A.I.M.\nThe story is set in the late-1980s, on the Caribbean island group of San Christobal.\nFollowing a coup d'\u00e9tat a socialist regime has been established on the island, a change that undermines the U.S. presence in the area.\nSeizing the opportunity, a hard-line fanatic general leads an elite U.S.S.R. military unit to establish a military base right under the nose of the U.S. Under the guise of shipping humanitarian aid, large amounts of cargo and military hardware are headed for San Christobal. A Russian presence larger and closer to the U.S. than Cuba could potentially tip the balance of power and turn a cold war into a steaming hot one.\nUnder secret orders from the CIA it is now up to you to assemble a team of capable mercenaries, restore the democratic government on San Christobal and drive out the U.S.S.R. presence, by any means necessary.\nWe are aiming to build Jagged Alliance: Flashback around the core pillars that made the originals great; the deep strategy, the thrilling action and character RPG elements. The core game is essentially split up into 2 layers, a strategy layer and a tactical layer.\nThe content of the two layers are shown below:\nBase Management is the strategy layer behind all the gun-toting and action, it is your base of operations, where you manage resources and control which missions to engage in.\nIt functions as a hub between missions and provides you with a map over the game world, it is also where you recruit, customize and take care of your mercenaries. \nThe base is also used to manage the training of your mercenaries, construction and weapon research/manufacturing.\n\nThe Tactical Screen is the turn-based action layer of the game, it features an isometric 3D camera view of the battlefield and it\u2019s where you control your squad of selected mercenaries to achieve objectives and engage enemies face-to-face.\nGear, character attributes and weapons all affect how a mercenary performs on the battlefield.\nThere will be fog of war, which prevents a full view of the battlefield and hides enemy movements.\nThe mercenaries can take cover behind objects in the world to gain different levels of protection.\nMercenaries also gain new abilities as they survive more battles, but when they die - it's permanent!\n\n\nWe are Full Control - a small independent game studio based in Copenhagen, Denmark. Over the years we have specialized in the genre of turn-based strategy games and have several productions in our portfolio. In fact, Jagged Alliance: Flashback will be our 9th title, and our 5th turn-base game in a row.\nOur productions have grown in size and complexity over the years, and we are finally ready to take on these iconic games like our current production Space Hulk as well as Jagged Alliance.\nIn addition we have built up a strong team of highly skilled professionals who have worked on various popular titles, illustrated below:\nOur current project is a turn-based version of the widely popular Warhammer 40k title \u201cSpace Hulk\u201d. With a successful Kickstarter project we can run pre-production of Jagged Alliance: Flashback while Space Hulk completes, and then go into full production on Flashback straight away once it ships - saving precious time to bring you the game as fast as possible.\nBelow you'll find links to a GDC demo of Spacehulk and a Gameplay Video from Frontline Tactics:\nWhile we have managed to secure the Jagged Alliance license, we have chosen not to pursue any funding through the license holder bitComposer, as we wanted to maintain and stay true to our vision of the game.\nKnowing that we couldn't finance the game out of our own pockets, we started kicking around the idea of doing a Kickstarter campaign to reach out to the community for help - So, this is why we are turning to you, fans of Jagged Alliance and turn-based action strategy games, and are hoping you will be part of bringing back one of the most iconic franchises of the turn-based game genre.\nOur approach for this Kickstarter funded project is transparency. We will give you the naked truth in frequent updates, as you are our backers and are entitled to know where your contribution endes up.\nBy pledging, you are not only supporting our vision of the game, you are also supporting the independent development of this game. We strongly feel that this should be a game by fans for the fans.\nKicking it Forward\nJagged Alliance: Flashback is supporting the Kicking it Forward initiative started by Brian Fargo and inXile.\nThis means that we pledge 5% of the revenue of Jagged Alliance: Flashback sales back into future Kickstarter projects.  We have chosen to primarily use the money to pledge towards turn-based tactical/strategic digital games.\nYou can read more about this on http://kickingitforward.org\n$350,000 is actually a small amount for a big game like Jagged Alliance. We can only do this because we have a lot of existing technology in place for turn-based strategy games and because we are using a expandable and modular story design.\nSince we are building the game based on our existing core technology for turn-based games, every penny donated in the Kickstarter will go to create the Jagged Alliance experience and not re-invent the wheels. Funds will be used to writing the story, making great environment art, adding mercenary characters and animations, building cool levels and programming Jagged Alliance game mechanics into our technology base.\nStory design wise, our plan is to create a great main story for the $350,000. If we surpass this minimum goal, we already have some tasty stretch goals planned for you. These will bring you additional levels, additional mercenaries and some of the more advanced features in a modular fashion.\nIn short, any funds received beyond the $350,000 will make everything about the game, bigger, better and more badass!\nIf you have come this far, backed us, watched the video or promoted our campaign we can\u2019t thank you enough! In the end Jagged Alliance: Flashback will only be possible with your support.\nWe are incredibly humbled that we have received the opportunity to work on a game that is so deeply rooted in the turn-based genre. We hope that you are just as excited as we are in being part of bringing Jagged Alliance back to its turn-based roots. We really can't wait to get started!\nThank you so much for coming by and thanks a MILLION for your pledge!\nSince we have been making a lot of changes to the pledges we've decided to make 2 spreadsheets to create a clearer overview. You can find it in the links below: ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMaking games is tough, challenging and full of risks. Over the last 9 years we have steadily built up experience by developing increasingly complex games under standard publishing deals.\n\nWe have taken this route because more often than not, smaller companies will take on big games as their first title and fail, either because of team inexperience, bad management or simply because there is no market for the game. \n\nOur approach is part of the reason we managed to land the Warhammer 40k \"SPACE HULK\" license with Games Workshop - the increased complexity of SPACE HULK meant that the we felt the next logical step for us would be to take on Jagged Alliance, our 9th game.\n\nFor the last 4 titles we have specialized in turn based strategy games, which means that we can take experience as well as battle proven code with us to the next game. Slowly increasing the ability to make more complex and larger games.\n\nThe risks we have identified at the moment are:\n\n* DRM-free delivery - finding good distribution channels to deliver on all 3 platforms. GOG is the obvious choice for Windows and also Mac. But what about Linux? Time will tell and worst case we will distribute the game to Linux owners ourselves.\n\n* expectations - Some will undoubtedly expect us to simply remake Jagged Alliance 2 and merge that with the community created patch called \"1.13\", this is not what we're aiming for. Flashback is a new game, built around the core gameplay mechanics from the original games, various elements from the 1.13 patch and some new ideas. Our aim is to get as many features in as possible but we simply cannot produce the same amount of content with the current budget.\n\n* delivery date - at the current time we expect a delivery date in late 2014. If the Kickstarter is very successful and exceeding our current plans, then that date might shift into 2015 simply due to budget size increase and added complexity by having more team members\n\n* engaging the community to finalize game design - we REALLY want to engage with you and allow the community as a group to give feedback on e.g. which features to add and what mercenaries to include in the game. But game development is not a democracy, and this means we will have to take decisions that might not be popular with everyone. Being transparent about this is our way to manage this risk\n\n* scope and budget - the proposed budget of $350,000 is only enough to make a solid core and a limited size of story. If we just barely make the goal, the game size will possibly not have the size and complexity of what some players expect from a spiritual successor for Jagged Alliance 2. But we would rather want to make a solid smaller turn-based Jagged Alliance:Flashback, than not make a game at all. And through the years afterwards we and the community could still add more content - it would simply not necessarily be there in version 1.0\n\n* modding - the game engine we are using is different than the engine used in Jagged Alliance 2. This gives new possibilities as well as cuts away others from earlier days. Given the final budget size, we want to include editors and modding as possible. But we can at this point not give any guarantees for modding feature X or asset Y.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #55", "update_userinfo": "Europe, Middle East and Russian Territories Shipping!

Coulton tweeted back \"DO IT.\" And so they did. \n \"What I love about this project is that it's the crazy kind of thing that just had to happen, and because of Twitter and Kickstarter and the internets, it actually can,\" says Pak. \"Jonathan and I are both working here as independent creators who own our own work. So if he says yes and I say yes and then whoever wants to buy it says yes, this beautiful thing can actually happen.\" \nTakeshi Miyazawa (\"Runaways\") will provide pencils and inks, Jessica Kholinne (\"X-Treme X-Men\") will color, and Simon Bowland (\"Incredible Hercules\") will letter. \n\"This thing has monkeys, robots and zombies. It hit the trifecta,\" says Miyazawa. \"How could I say no?\" \nThe plan is to produce a 60 page graphic novel that will be released digitally in four parts through Monkeybrain Comics and comiXology and then in a collected trade paperback form. \n\"We're very excited to be working with Monkeybrain and comiXology,\" says Pak. \"Monkeybrain has done an amazing job of getting fantastic, genuinely independent creator-owned comics out into the world and comiXology has developed a phenomenal app for viewing comics on digital devices.\"\nKickstarter backers will get each of the digital comics and the hard copy of the graphic novel during an exclusive window before the books are sold to general public. And there are multiple added bonuses possible for Kickstarter backers, including first dibs on a brand new song written and performed by Coulton. \nAnother standout reward is the limited edition Code Monkey figure, sculpted by the acclaimed comic artist Sean Chen from the Takeshi Miyazawa character design. \nWork-in-progress of Sean Chen's sculpt for the Code Monkey figurine!

It won't be print ready but will be big enough to make it your iPad background etc.\nAdditional Votes?\nSay you've already backed the poster but your roommate, girlfriend, boyfriend, husband, or wife also want in on the action but you only need one print on your wall. Just add $1 to your pledge amount for each additional vote.\nAdditional prints?\nIf one print isn't enough and you need another one just double your pledge amount. Two posters = $60 etc. You will get one vote for each poster. \nWhat is the Night Shift Design Cooperative?\nAt The Night Shift Design Cooperative, we(that means you too) create projects that use both crowd-funding and crowd-sourcing to allow people to get more involved in design. We feel that if you're really going to love a print then you should have a say in the project.\nDuring the day shift I'm an Art Director at an advertising agency but once that work is done I find time for projects like this.

Using the original Greek myths of Jason and the Argonauts and Medea as a stepping stone, this production depicts love and hate at their most primal. By mixing in contemporary references (pop culture and modern science are equal players, here) and elements of black comedy, \u201cJason <3 Medea\u201d looks at this classic love story through a radical new lens. Stranded on an island where time and space are fickle bedfellows, Jason and Medea must confront their past actions and choose between a life of epic adventure or humble civility. Are their destinies bringing them together, or tearing the world apart?\nSounds great! But just who is putting this thing on?\nThis project is being produced by a group of Los Angeles based art and theatre-makers under the umbrella of Vespertine Productions. Vespertine is responsible for critically-acclaimed productions of Harold Pinter's \"The Dumb Waiter\" and Sam Shepard's \"Fool for Love\".\nVespertine has a revolving door of incredible talent that come to play under its banner. For this particular production, we have actors and designers whose ranks include such credits as the National Theatre of Croatia, The Getty Villa, Warner Brothers, Fox, NBC Universal, and more! These are award-winning creators and I personally am thrilled to be involved with them. There is no doubt that we are creating something great!\nFor more information regarding the artists involved in this project, please visit our Fringe website here.\nCreative Team (so far):\nDirector/Designer: Matthew G.

When Melgorn denied Agrin\u2019s request, he cursed Agrin with a mark and sent him away to the northern country of Undreg. Agrin vowed that he would again return to defeat Melgorn and take the eternity staff as his own and then destroy the land of Pauvle where Melgorn\u2019s tower lies. The mark of Agrin\u2019s curse has come to the land and Melgorn has no choice but to find a new apprentice to focus his training on.

Or follow us on Twitter and on Facebook for updates\n-----------------------------------------\nLong before Google Glass ... there was the Camera Lucida.\nThe what?\nThe camera lucida.\nIt\u2019s a prism on a stick! For making realistic drawings!\nIt used to be everywhere.\nA portable version hasn\u2019t been manufactured in generations.\nAnd we\u2019re bringing it back.\nReally inexpensively.\nFor artists and art students everywhere.\nWe have designed the NeoLucida: the first portable camera lucida to be manufactured in nearly a century \u2014 and the lowest-cost commercial camera lucida ever designed. We want to make this remarkable device widely available to students, artists, architects, and anyone who loves to draw from life. But to be clear: our NeoLucida is not just a product, but a provocation. In manufacturing a camera lucida for the 21st century, our aim is to stimulate interest in media archaeology\u2014the tightly interconnected history of visual culture and imaging technologies.\nOur project: the NeoLucida, a camera lucida for the 21st century. Shown here is a working prototype, constructed from a combination of mass-manufactured and custom-machined parts.\nWhat is this \"NeoLucida\"?\nThe NeoLucida is a drawing aid that allows you to trace what you see. Our device is the first portable, authentic camera lucida to be manufactured in nearly a century\u2014but we like to think of it as a disruption to widespread assumptions about art-making and art history. Our design is lightweight (9oz., or 0.25kg), sturdy, compact enough to fit in a handbag, highly adjustable, totally non-electronic, and released with a liberal open-source hardware license. It's also the least-expensive camera lucida ever manufactured. If you enjoy drawing from life, or if you're interested in experiencing for yourself how the Old Masters could possibly have created such accurate, lifelike drawings\u2014then the NeoLucida is for you. \nLeft: Our NeoLucida, $40. Right: An antique Camera Lucida (c.1900), about $350 on eBay. Owing to modern innovations such as adjustable gooseneck, the NeoLucida has a considerably simpler design.\nSome background history. \nBeginning in the early 17th century, artists routinely used optical aids to help them create realistic drawings. Lenses and mirrors were the \"cutting edge technology\" of their day (and sometimes, the trade secret) for making life-like images. In 1807, Sir William Hyde Wollaston invented the Camera Lucida\u2014and brought life-drawing to a whole new level. Wollaston's device was simple: a prism on an adjustable stand. When an artist looks down through the prism, they see the world in front of them, plus their hand on the page, combined in perfect superimposition. \nIn short, a camera lucida allows you to trace what you see. And it does so in full daylight; there's no need for a dark shroud or box, as with a Camera Obscura. And that is the magic of the camera lucida: it's portable, easy to use, and\u2014with a little practice\u2014you just copy the world onto your page with a confident hand. \nBy the mid-1800s, camera lucidas were everywhere. Indeed, the device is so effective in assisting accurate life-drawing that, according to the controversial Hockney-Falco hypothesis, it's now believed that many of the most admired drawings of the 19th Century, such as the Neoclassical portraits of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, could only have been made with a camera lucida. This becomes astonishingly clear if you try one\u2014an experience we hope to share with as many people as possible, through this Kickstarter.\n(If you'd like to learn more about how the Old Masters likely used optical technologies to create their work, check out David Hockney's book Secret Knowledge, or this terrific BBC documentary (at YouTube) about his research.)\nThe NeoLucida setup: clamp your NeoLucida to a table or drawing board. Place your subject in front, with your paper on the table below the prism. Simply look down into the prism to start drawing.\nPlace your eye close to the prism, looking straight down at the prism's exposed edge, to see a perfect blend of your hand and the scene in front of you.\nOur prototype in action. Here's an unaltered photograph taken through the NeoLucida's eyepiece. The world in front of you is superimposed onto your paper. Just trace what you see!\nNow try this experiment. Go to a group of fine-art students. Find the ones who claim to adore the \"Old Masters\"\u2014and ask them if they\u2019ve ever tried, or even heard of, a camera lucida. We'll bet they haven't (or that they've confused it with the camera obscura). Perhaps it's because a different \"camera\"\u2014the photographic film camera\u2014revolutionized image-making in the intervening century. Once photography became accessible to all, previously common drawing tools like the camera lucida were almost entirely forgotten\u2014and the Old Masters who used them were increasingly believed to have possessed supernatural drawing powers. \nIt hasn't helped that portable camera lucidas have become so rare and costly that most students will never have the chance to try one\u2014not even in an art school. Authentic camera lucidas have become curiosities and fetish objects for antiquarians and professionals, typically costing $300-$500 on eBay. But it's a marvellously simple, useful device\u2014it shouldn't be so exotic!\nSo, why are you doing this? We both have a lot of students who've come to believe that being able to draw photo-realistically is the most important thing. We both love realistic drawing, but not necessarily the way it\u2019s usually taught\u2014which often ignores the tightly-intertwined relationship between drawing and imaging technologies. In particular, art students are encouraged to draw photo-realistically, in the manner of the Old Masters, but without the proper tools for doing so. So we're producing the NeoLucida as a provocation, not as a business, to help get this discussion started. We hope the NeoLucida will prompt new questions about the relationship of art and technology\u2014and potentially even disrupt business-as-usual in the classroom. Most importantly, we genuinely believe that using a camera lucida will profoundly change how people see, how they draw, and how they think about art. \nPortraits by Pablo, created with an antique camera lucida (c.1900, left), and the NeoLucida (right).\nOur Plan.\nWait: aren't there modern, competing products?\nWe wouldn't be doing this if there were any modern-day camera lucidas that met our criteria for easy portability, low cost, and authentic optical design. Unfortunately, there aren't. For example, the LUCID-Art costs $200, weighs four times as much as the NeoLucida, and can't fit in a handbag. Likewise, the LUCI costs more than twice as much as ours; it's bulky, and difficult to adjust. And because the LUCI uses a mirror instead of a prism, you have to draw everything upside-down! (With ours, you draw right-side-up.) Amazingly, these are the only camera lucidas currently being manufactured today\u2014and neither uses the elegant and compact optical design employed throughout the 19th century.\nDesign and Production.\nWe know that for a young artist to even consider experimenting with a camera lucida, it has to be inexpensive. So we\u2019ve designed the NeoLucida to consist almost entirely of prefabricated parts made in China (such as the clamp, prism, and flexible gooseneck mount), and available through business-to-business marketplaces like Alibaba. The only custom pieces (in the optics mount) have been designed by our expert friends at StandardRobot, a Pittsburgh-based mechatronics studio, and will be machined right here in the U.S.A. For both international and domestic parts, we\u2019ve already received multiple bids from different suppliers, and have factored the costs of shipping and customs into our reckoning. \nOur design is complete. We've learned a ton about the Chinese component marketplace. We\u2019ve made and tested several working prototypes, and we're ready to fufill our dream of getting inexpensive camera lucidas into the hands of lots of people. But to do this at all, we have to meet our suppliers\u2019 minimum order requirements\u2014usually, depending on the component, at least 500 pieces. If we can raise 500 orders, then our dream can be your reality! The NeoLucidas themselves will be assembled at Golan\u2019s studio in Pittsburgh, with the assistance of some careful students.\nThis is a Limited Run of Open Source Hardware.\nOur first batch of NeoLucidas will also be our only batch\u2014because, as we\u2019ve explained, we\u2019re doing this as a fun intervention, not to start a business. Once we\u2019ve finished distributing the NeoLucidas, we will publish our designs, CAD files, and all of our supplier data with a liberal Creative Commons and Open-Source Hardware (OSHW) license, so that anyone who wishes can continue the project (including, potentially, commercially). Our design and other manufacturing information will appear on NeoLucida.com, Instructables, Scribd, and other appropriate sites. We hope others will be inspired to pick up where we leave off!\nYour own NeoLucida. \nIf you support our project at the $40 level or higher, you'll get one NeoLucida in a draw-string pouch, plus instructions on using and caring for your device. The cost of shipping (within the US) is included.\nSo how is your NeoLucida \u201cprism-on-a-stick\u201d manufactured? We use a silvered prism, optimized for optical clarity, carefully encased in a custom anodized aluminum mount. The prism is supported by a highly adjustable gooseneck arm and a sturdy metal clamp. We even use a 1/4\u201d-20 threaded bolt as the connection between the gooseneck arm and the prism holder\u2014so your NeoLucida arm can easily double as a standard camera mount. All this is hand-assembled in Pittsburgh before being carefully packaged and sent off to you. Open it up and start drawing right away!\nBut there's more. Beyond just making a device for your use, we really want to see what you draw with your NeoLucida. In some ways, this is the true heart of our project. That\u2019s why every recipient of a NeoLucida will also receive a postage-prepaid blank postcard. And a NeoLucida pencil, too. Make a drawing with your NeoLucida, pop the card in the mail, and your drawing may end up in a published collection of NeoLucida drawings!\nCan I get more than one? Unfortunately not, per Kickstarter's \"Single Serving rule\" for rewards in the Product Design category. If, however, you're interested in classroom packs or other wholesale arrangements, please contact us privately. \nBacked by Primary Research.  \nSo, how are we qualified to do this, and why are we confident? We're both art professors and have spent the bulk of our careers using both modern and historical imaging technologies. Sure, most artists have used digital cameras\u2014but we've logged tons of hours with concave mirrors, large biconvex lenses, camera obscuras and camera lucidas.\nSelections from Pablo Garcia's personal collection of vintage camera lucidas.\nPablo using one of his antique camera lucidas, Iceland, 2010.\nExamples of Pablo's camera lucida drawings, 2010.\nPablo has spent a dozen years drawing with his camera lucida. Since acquiring his first one in 2001, he has also amassed one of the world's largest collections of primary and secondary research into the technology and history of this device. Pablo's collection includes many of the most important books, patents, articles, schematics, and contemporary accounts of the camera lucida. \nPossibly the best evidence that we're qualified to conduct this project is Pablo\u2019s personal collection of antique camera lucidas. Over the course of a decade, he has acquired the best examples of original camera lucidas throughout history. In his collection are devices from 1820, 1840, 1860, 1880, 1900, 1930, and several versions sold as children's drawing aids from the 1940s through the 1960s. This collection is one of the most complete primary resources on the technology around\u2014and served as the research foundation for our design of the NeoLucida.\nWho are we?\nPablo Garcia and Golan Levin are university art professors and new-media artists, with a strong shared interest in the history and poetics of imaging technologies.\nPablo Garcia (@prgarc) is Assistant Professor of Contemporary Practices at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.

We are not only leveraging the Chinese factory system, with its standard parts ready for shipping, but also small, American design and fabrication companies with proven track records. This gives us the best of both worlds, allowing us to combine inexpensive components with custom components where appropriate.\n\nShould manufacturing issues arise, we have several options for local fabrication companies in Pittsburgh and Chicago. Finding alternate sources for the custom parts is not as difficult as it was ten years ago. These digitally-driven fabrication methods are now common industry standards. \n\nIn addition, we have both spent decades providing technical solutions to creative problems. Pablo was trained as an architect and designer and has spent over a decade working with digital fabrication equipment. Golan is a new media artist who has created and deployed robust, technically sophisticated installations all over the world.

Siuda", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Like a lot of great ideas, this one was born in an independent bookstore.\nI saw a beautifully produced hardcover and pulled it down to see who had published it. It was a quirky small press I had never heard of - Wolverine Farm. I immediately googled them. The first two words that jumped out from their website were COMMUNITY and SUPPORT, and I thought, \"Hey!\nCOMMUNITY-SUPPORTED LITERATURE!\nThat should totally be a thing!\"\nA flood of ideas hit my brain all at once - like a farm box! like subscribe and you get something amazing each month! for the adventurous, voracious reader! undiscovered authors! so much fun! - and then they were all drowned out by one more: \"Please tell me that is not what these folks are already doing!\" (It's not, although they are doing a lot of other amazing things for their local community.)\nWhat is community-supported literature? \nI'm glad you asked! It's a lot like Community-Supported Agriculture. When you subscribe to a CSA box, you get an amazing box of super-fresh, organic, fruits and veggies direct from your local farm, every week or month. When a bunch of people in your community do this, it supports local independent farmers. They know they have a certain number of subscribers lined up, so instead of worrying about producing a ton of marketable, commercial produce in the hope that big stores will carry it, they can focus on quality.\nDelightful For Readers\n Hand-Picked Words is a small press that showcases dazzling undiscovered authors. Our Book Box will include four or five short pieces, like short stories, creative nonfiction, personal essays, letterpress art, and really good poetry, as well as a great book. If it goes well, we will offer more of them, as a regular monthly subscription!\nIf you love books as much as I do, you know the horror of running out of things to read. No matter how many suggestions my friends, librarian, local bookstores, and Amazon might make, there is always that unsatisfying point where I've read everything that my favorite authors have written for now, and haven't found anything new to try yet. It's like being stranded! This is the solution: a delightful delivery of brand-new, exciting work that draws you in, no matter what genre or subject, because it's so well-written.\nFantastic For Writers\nThere are so many authors out there who write well, but don't market themselves well, or don't have the time and money to do their marketing - or just would rather be writing than fighting to get published. In order to get a deal with a traditional publisher, you can't just be good - you also have to be marketable. Because in order for it to be financially worth it to you and all the other people getting a piece of the profits, your book has to sell hundreds of thousands of copies. You're only getting 10%-15% of that, after all.\nThe Book Box is more like self-publishing -- with marketing, editing, and production support. Authors can focus on quality and innovation, instead of on producing really commercial work. They get a cut of the profits from the Book Box, and they get almost all the royalties when we help them sell their work on its own afterward. \nOur dream is to find amazing authors, and give them a venue to create the work of their dreams. All those pieces that would be too short, too quirky, or just too much for the mainstream market. \nWhat The Kickstarter Is For\nWe've drawn up the marketing plans. We've given samples to people who love beauty subscription boxes and books equally. We've found amazingly talented writers, people who can make beautiful worlds come to life with their keyboards. And we've already begun work on the first box.\nThis Kickstarter is raising money for the tiny little essentials of life that will make this happen. The boring parts, like \"and\" or \"the\", without which any story would never exist. Things like:\na lawyer's help drawing up our basic book contract\ngorgeous print copies\nfabulous book design, inside and out \na little extra marketing push for our very first authors\nOkay - maybe not so boring after all. \nWhat Else?\nIf we exceed our Kickstarter goal, there's another phase I'd love to add in.\nSelf-publisher and horror/mystery writer Joe Konrath has described some awesome visions for the future of ebooks. We'll happily try to make them come true.\nThe biggest vision is to create an ebook app that would include reviews, forums, a chatroom for author interviews and book groups, audio author commentary throughout the books. And spam-free reader commentary, too, like a commenting system embedded throughout the book, set up so that people could choose to turn it off and on, and even get notifications if somebody commented on a book that they had read. It could even include a way to let both authors and readers edit and add sections, and switches to turn different people's input off and on.\n\nLove the book, but hate the ending? Add your own. Think it would be better without that whole vampire clown subplot? Delete it, and share your version with others. Want to know what happens next? Get together with others in the chat room or forums, brainstorm the rest of the story, and add it to the book. Curious about how the author was influenced by the classical work that they mention, or how much of the book was autobiographical? Listen to their commentary.\n\nThe possibilities are endless. Let's create them together.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenge is in attracting enough amazing work to fill the box.

(You\u2019ll be able to get it from Steam, and other DRM-free download options will be made available.)\nThe Cold, Calculating Jack (by Nils Hamm)\nEndorsements\n\"Planescape: Torment is one of the games that I am the most proud to have worked on, and it is great to see the talented team at inXile going back and re-creating a great new game that tips its hat to the original Torment. Having it based on Monte Cook's Numenera makes me want to play it even sooner \u2013 so make it now, guys!\"\n- Feargus Urquhart, CEO, Obsidian Entertainment; formerly president of Black Isle Studios\n\"I have a lot of respect for the folks [on the Torment team] and I've worked with many of them, including Kevin, Brian, Colin, Adam, and more, across several projects and across several companies, including Interplay, Obsidian, and more recently inXile on Wasteland 2. I believe they'll do Torment with the right aesthetic and justice it deserves.\"\n- Chris Avellone, Creative Director, Obsidian Entertainment; lead designer of Planescape: Torment\n\"10K. Mostly because awesome.\"\n- Markus \"Notch\" Persson, creator of Minecraft and owner of Mojang, on his pledge to Torment: Tides of Numenera\nTorment's Four Pillars\nFour pillars undergird the Torment name and, despite all the shake we'll do of RPG conventions, we'll stay true to these throughout the development of Torment: Tides of Numenera.\nA Deep, Thematically Satisfying Story. The philosophical underpinnings of Torment drive the game, both mechanically and narratively. Your words, choices, and actions will be your primary weapons.\nA World Unlike Any Other. The game has a fantastic, original setting, with awe-inspiring painterly visuals, imaginative locations, truly offbeat items, and massive feats of magic. In Numenera, however, \u201cmagic\u201d is actually something surprisingly different.\nA Rich, Personal Narrative. The story is thoughtful and character-driven\u2014epic in feel but a deeply personal narrative, with nontraditional characters and companions who have their own motivations and desires that drive them throughout the game.\nReactivity, Choice, and Real Consequences. The game emphasizes replayability and reactivity, and your choices will make a real difference. You can play the game with a different approach and discover entirely new pathways. Most important, we won\u2019t tell you how to play. The best ending is the one you choose, flowing naturally from your actions throughout the game.\nClick this header to learn more about our story at our tumblr site\nThe original Torment was a novel experience, a genre-defying game that helped redefine what was possible in RPG storytelling. We mentioned our Four Pillars above, and describe them in greater detail at our tumblr site.\nHere\u2019s a brief summary of our story:\n\nYou are the Last Castoff, the final link in the chain of the lives of the being they call the Changing God. He once was a man who discovered a way to use the relics of the ancients to cheat death and skip across the face of centuries in a succession of bodies. But he never knew that his bodies lived on as his consciousness fled, a new consciousness arising in each. Now he has awakened an age-old enemy, the Angel of Entropy, and his days of change are gone as the Angel hunts him and all his works. That includes... you.\n\nWith the ever-present threat of oblivion looming over you, you must find your sire before he\u2014and you\u2014are eradicated by the avenging Angel. You will find allies and enemies among the other castoffs. You might inhabit their minds for a time through the devices called \u201cthe Meres,\u201d turning their lives to your advantage. You will travel across the face of the Ninth World, and above and below it, with your companions at your side\u2014or alone, if you wish. Your quest will take you to alternate dimensions and distant worlds under strange suns; particular Meres might afford you even more bizarre experiences, such as folding time itself. And you will build your legacy as you find your answer to the question:\n\nWhat does one life matter?\nSojourner of Worlds (by Chang Yuan)\nClick this header to learn more about gameplay at our tumblr site\nTorment will have a strong emphasis on story and character development, which will permeate other facets of gameplay, such as combat and exploration. The Ninth World is a place of great mystery and wonder, all waiting to be discovered. To read more details of our gameplay plans, including information on Combat, Dialogue, and Companions, please visit our tumblr site.\nYou'll play the role of a specific individual. At the game\u2019s start, however, you are a blank slate and have control over the path you take through the story, and you will also make choices to customize your abilities and skills. We\u2019re taking the approach of having you role-play a specific individual so that we can focus on telling a very personal tale \u2013 yours.\nDust and Water (by Andr\u00e9e Wallin)\nWhat Are the Tides?\nThere are unseen forces in the Ninth World, forces that have profound and lasting effects for those attuned to their motions. Like gravity or magnetism, the Tides are invisible, powerful, and with the right tools, perhaps controllable.\nThe Tides represent complicated concepts that aren't entirely definable by language. Those who acknowledge the Tides have given them symbolic colors based on how they appear to correspond with emotional and psychological reactions. For example:\nThe Tides reflect your choices, the subtle currents of motivation that ripple through your life.\nThe colors are important, because a word like \"justice\" (for example) is too simplistic. The Indigo Tide represents not only justice and fairness; it might also mean a desire for the greater good or an \"end justifies the means\" mentality. The Gold Tide can represent false philanthropy as well as martyrdom\u2014it's the actions that matter, not the motivations. In the game, the Tides serve as a kind of alignment system\u2014but a more nuanced one, and one that does not judge actions based on whether they are good or evil. You'll learn more about the Tides as you explore Torment. And the Tides will gradually change based on your actions and decisions, ultimately determining your Legacy.\nWhat Do You Mean by My Legacy?\nThere's your legacy, the stories others tell about you and the inspirations they find in your life, and your Legacy, which we're systematizing here. Your Legacy is determined by which Tides you manipulate the most. Do you use your wisdom to help others? Do you seek power for the greater good? Maybe you're an avenger, taking whatever action is necessary to aid those around you. Perhaps you're just in it for the prestige. (Or money. People are always in it for the money.) As your choices move the Tides, your Legacy will be revealed.\nYour Legacy also influences the world around you. Weapons and relics may have different bonuses for characters with certain Legacies. Some of them might respond positively if you've revealed yourself to be a thinker or an artist, while others might help you only if you're moved by passion and power.\nYour Legacy opens new potential abilities. Some Legacies can change the very structure of your body, giving you superhuman powers: the ability to read the past in the minds of the dead, for instance, or a nearly supernatural affinity with weapons.\nSagus Cliffs at Dawn (by Chang Yuan)\nClick this header to learn more about our team at our tumblr site\nTorment is being developed by inXile entertainment, a mid-sized independent game developer located in Newport Beach, CA. inXile was founded by Brian Fargo in 2002 and is best known for its action-RPG The Bard\u2019s Tale. The Android version of that game was released in fall 2012, topping the charts and winning several awards. \nWith inXile, Brian has embraced the crowdfunding approach. He is a vocal advocate of circumventing the traditional publisher-developer business model, with developers instead communicating and working directly with the players.\nOur experience with crowd funding has been wonderfully positive for us at inXile and has opened our eyes to the power of a direct relationship with the gamers. We want to create RPGs in a fashion and style that helped to make the true classics. And along these lines we've abandoned the typical developer/publisher model and placed our future in the hands of RPG gamers. We've embraced the crowd in every aspect. YOU are our publisher...and you are the best publisher we've ever worked with!\nThis process allows us to create the games exactly the way you want to see them. There is a purity of development when we can spend 100% of our efforts making the game with an open dialogue throughout the process. We'll start with a strong vision document that details our sensibilities, and from there we'll stay in sync with you, from concept through the execution of the ideas.\nWe've discovered that the best way to create a deep and rich RPG is to begin the pre-production process long before the production team have finished their current project. If we waited to begin the design work for a large scale RPG until after the programming team has completed their work, our budget would increase by 50% or more.  This would result in the hiring and firing process that happens all too often in our industry. We want to break that model and keep our great team together. This is why it makes sense for us to begin work on Torment now rather than later. The process has served us well in the past and allows us to bring you the best RPGs. If you have any concerns about our ability to deliver a great one, we encourage you to review our first look video of Wasteland 2 that was released just a few weeks ago.\nWe're grateful for all the support and look forward to bringing you the kind of role-playing games that we all love to play.\nWith Torment, Brian pledged to personally add $100k to the project if we reached the $900,000 goal but fell short of a million. And if funding beat $1 million, he pledged to instead contribute 10 cents from every $1 pledged from the $1 million to $2 million mark. Brian is thus kicking in $100K of his own (this is not reflected in the Kickstarter total and all will be applied directly to the development budget). Torment superfan Steve Dengler (@Dracogen) picked up the torch when we reached $2M, matching 10% of every donation from $2 to $3 million, and thus also putting in $100K of his own. These matches will be added post-Kickstarter to help offset failed pledges, and do not count towards stretch goals.\nThis product is participating in Brian Fargo\u2019s Kicking It Forward initiative, promising to pledge 5% of its post-release profit to other Kickstarter projects. We are proud to join the over 200 successfully funded Kickstarter projects whose founders share Brian\u2019s vision of supporting the independent efforts of others.\nThe Ascension of Kex-Lianish (by Andr\u00e9e Wallin)\nBy pledging at an amount above the Tier you have selected, you can include Add-Ons.

Fortunately, we collectively have more than 80 years of experience in managing them. Given our great progress in developing Wasteland 2, our experience with the technology, and our approach to Torment\u2019s design and production, we are confident in our ability to provide our backers with a quality game deserving of the Torment name.\n\nTorment\u2019s schedule has been designed to maximize both planning (preproduction) and polishing. This extended preproduction period controls costs and increases quality because we\u2019ll have a very well-defined product before production begins. Our target release date of December 2014 allows us 14 months for production and finalization. (In comparison, Wasteland 2 had 12 months, and Mask of the Betrayer had nine.) Furthermore, various systems and tools developed for Wasteland 2 will be used or adapted for Torment, saving development time and budget.\n\nWith a longer schedule, you might wonder how we\u2019ll be able to create Torment if it receives less funding than Wasteland 2 did. First, Torment's story is being designed to be highly modular and scalable. This approach not only lets us increase game reactivity and replayability, but it also let us keep the game's scope flexible. At our target funding, we\u2019ll be able to deliver a complete and satisfying game and as funding increases above the target, Torment will continue to grow in depth and size. But, as resources allow \u2013 if Wasteland 2 is a commercial success, for example \u2013 we are ready to expand the modular story. \n\nAlso, inXile has established secondary revenue streams that will bolster Torment\u2019s development budget. For example, last September, The Bard\u2019s Tale was released on Android, winning many awards and selling hundreds of thousands of copies in just a few months. While this doesn\u2019t provide enough money to create a game like Torment, it lets us invest in Wasteland 2 and Torment to improve their quality. Although Torment would not be possible without your support, we are self-funding a portion of the game as well.

THE SQUARE is a film about a group of young Egyptians brought together by a revolution, who find a new sense of hope for their country. THE SQUARE celebrates the process of a truly democratic movement as it unfolds in real time.\nThe revolution is far from over, we still have a lot of work to do to complete our film the way we want to. We\u2019re off to a great start - we won the World Documentary Audience Award at Sundance 2013, but our mission to inspire the world is just beginning. \nWe are asking you, the Kickstarter community, to help finish our film. There are so many ways we want to make sure this film really comes to life after its debut at Sundance. We hope to raise the funds to return to the edit for 6 to 8 weeks to incorporate fully the recent events unfolding, to complete a full score for the film, and to finish with a sound and color mix that will make the experience as powerful in the theater as it was in the street. \nIt's been two years since we began this incredible project. We've come this far and are committed to continue because we believe this is a story that needs to be shared. Our crew has been arrested, shot at, and made huge sacrifices - because this is a story that they want the world to watch. \nJoin us now. By backing this film, you\u2019ll be doing much more than supporting a film on Kickstarter, you\u2019ll be contributing to spreading the voice of freedom and democracy - of hope and of progress. We can't wait to show this film to the world. \nAs they say in the film, \u201cNo one can tell our stories except for us.\u201d We are duty-bound to ensure that the story of Tahrir Square is told by the people who lived it. \nHELP GET THE REAL STORY OUT. \nSincerely,\n- Jehane Noujaim, Director, THE SQUARE\nPS- While editing the film in Cairo artist Ammar Abo Bakr and his crew El Moshir & Ziad painted a new mural each day that represented the major events of the revolution in vivid color.

Now we're asking for you to become a backer and accompany us as we complete this exciting new project.\n\nWon't you come along for the ride?\nTeaser Trailer\nSynopsis:\nThe Crystal Crypt is a science fiction short story by Philip K. Dick that was first published in the January 1954 edition of Planet Stories magazine.\nThe story is set in the distant future, with Earth and Mars on the verge of war. \nThe last spaceship to leave Mars for Earth is suddenly stopped by Martian soldiers in search of three saboteurs who have destroyed a Martian city. \nThe criminals are not found, and the ship continues toward Earth. \nOnboard the spaceship, a businessman named Thacher meets a young woman and two men who tell him that they are, in fact, the people the Martians are looking for. They proceed to explain to Thacher what they have done, and how their deeds were to be used as a bargaining chip against Mars in the upcoming war. \nLook at These Rewards!\nProducer's T-Shirt Rewards recently added!:\nIMPORTANT:\nLive outside the United States? Please read the PROJECT FAQs at the bottom of this page before attempting to pledge to this project!\nWhat kind of quality can you expect in the final film?\nWe are working with amazing producer Zeus Zamani, who most recently produced the film Battlefield America (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw93esZ-CA8). His team is extremely talented at producing high-quality videography while on a tight budget. \nIn 2011, Zamani and his team partnered with the Zargari brothers to work on a commissioned Luxor Las Vegas advertising campaign that involved the scripting, storyboarding, and production of an original 90-second commercial, as well as a music video for the song used in the TV spot. We ended up winning a total of five Silver Awards at the 2012 Davey Awards, including a trophy for the Videography & Cinematography category.\nWe were ecstatic! Not only did this recognition cap a very successful 2012, it gave our team a boost of confidence needed to see this short film through to the end.  \nComfirmed CAST\nYuri Lowenthal - http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0523180/\nTara Platt - http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1297428/\nCyrus Zoghi - http://cyrusz.com/reel\nJean Gomez - https://www.facebook.com/jeangomezcosplay\nEvan Cassidy - http://www.dudelyjones.com/about.html\nConfirmed CREW\nShahab Zargari (Director) - http://flavors.me/shahab\nZeus Zamani (Producer) - http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4153541/\nShahram Zargari (Writer) - http://bit.ly/VL2QEv\nDenise Borders (Production Coordinator) - http://imdb.to/V5zswb\nTai Shane (Makeup Artist) - https://www.facebook.com/taimua\nConfirmed MUSIC\nAquarium (Dischord Records) - http://www.dischord.com/band/aquarium\nShelby Cinca/Triobelisk - http://triobelisk.bandcamp.com/\nOfficial HASHTAG\n#crystalcrypt\nSPREAD THE WORD!\nWe think our project has awesome potential.

There are a few reasons for this. \nOne: We only seek assistance -- we're not looking for a handout. We are prepared to take this project from where we are now through to the end, and we would like to do so with your support and blessing. \nTwo: If we surpass the Kickstarter goal with time to spare, we will unveil a few more exclusive rewards to see if we can reach the $45,900 mark. \nFYI\nAll or nothing.\nIf we don't raise the entire amount of the goal, no donations will be processed.  \nIf we do reach the goal early, it is possible to continue to raise funds until the Kickstarter time has expired. There are plenty of ways any extra money can be spent on this film to increase its quality and visibility!\nTHANK YOU!!\n\nLow on funds, but still want to help?\nIf you can help us spread the word and are able to convince two people to back our project at the $25+ levels, we'll send you a free DVD.

Dick is in the public domain solely under US law, and this is the only region we have any rights to the story without breaking international law. Therefore, all funds must originate from within the USA.\n\nThis presents a significant challenge, and could possibly hinder our total potential, but we will continue to plug away. Our production of \"The Crystal Crypt\" is in no way intended to be a profitable venture; rather it is a love letter of sorts to the sci-fi genre.\n\nPossible Delays: \nAs long as we fund the project in time, we can thwart any potential causes for delay in the shooting schedule. Post-production delays are always a possibility, but we will be sure to keep all of our backers in the loop.\n\nShipping & Fulfilling the Rewards: \nWe are completely optimistic that we will get through all of the normal challenges that come along with shooting a film. That being said, we have been working with DVD manufacturers for over 10 years and run multiple inline stores of our own. We know the importance of pre-orders and shipping goods, and promise that communication will be key.\n\nThough we have set our goal based on rough estimates, unexpected expenses can arise because of any combination of issues. We will adapt to any hurdles in our way, however, because it is what we do best.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "The GC 4\n4 created \u00b7 51 backed\nCreative family of four.

My book will not only be published, but it will also be advertised and sent to several critics for much needed reviews.\nWe've reached the $2,500 needed for editing, formatting, publishing, and basic advertising.\nYou guys did it again. Two days in, and two goals have been reached. The third goal is the one that will raise this book above the endless sea of other self-published works. \nWith $3,500+ I will be able to do the following:\n-Start a professional looking, interactive website promoting the book.\n-Send an additional 20 copies to known bloggers for additional reviews and visibility.\n-Promote the book through Google advertising, significantly enhancing the visibility in Google's search engine.\n-Pay for the banner ads on popular blogs.\nI am still stunned at the amount of support you're showing me. You're propelling this book into the world faster than I ever dreamed possible.\nStretch Goal: $2,500\nWell, how about that? I wake up this morning and what do I see? Awesome people have already funded my project.\nThe absolutely essential $1,500 has been achieved.\nYou've already made sure that my book is published with proper editing. Now, it is time to spread the good word. Reaching the $2,500 stretch goal will provide the following for this project: \n-I will be able to print extra copies to be sent out to critics across the country, which will provide necessary visibility for this book. \n-Self publishing is a tough game. With this new funding, I will be able to buy advertisements that are essential to promotion of my work. This means Amazon promotions, paid ads, etc.\n-Additional funds will also allow me to distribute the book more easily to many university libraries as well as the brick and mortar stores.\nYou guys made this book, and now is the time for the world to read it. \nWhat are you talking about? An orange?\nI know, I know, it's strange. I'll be the first to admit it. \nWhen I was 17 and living in a small European country of Montenegro, something out of the ordinary started happening to me. My mother's friend, who would visit us often, began acting absolutely strange when only her and I would be left in the room. She'd change her voice to a childish tone and all she would ask me to do was... Well, to take the orange from her.\nI, of course, felt uncomfortable around this woman and would avoid her as much as I could. However, she started following me. She'd appear in my window, in the street, and even in hotels when I'd travel. \nLuckily, I went to America to study, and soon the strange encounters were forgotten. Until 10 years later, when I saw her again, 5,000 miles away from home. She was holding an orange.\nMy personal horror was back. \nIt all got much worse when i learned that my girlfriend used to be followed by this woman way before we got together. While trying to make sense of this absurdity, I found out that my grandmother has had numerous encounters with this person decades before I was born.\nI posted some of my experiences on a horror forum called NoSleep, which is part of a social website Reddit. My story got an unbelievable following. It won every possible award, from it being in top 5 posts of all time, to it winning The Best Story of 2012. \nMany offered to adapt the story into short movies, books, programs, and podcasts. Majority of readers requested that I put my experiences into a book so I can reveal the complete account of what happened. \nSo that's what I'm doing. I'm writing a book about what happened.\nIf you'd like, you can read my initial posts here.\nWhy will this book be any different than all the others?\nFor starters, this is an actual account of my personal horror. Because of this, the book will not be written in a standard, descriptive way. You will not find descriptions such as \"she was walking through the barely lit room almost as gracefully as a dancer under the moonlight.\" No. I tell you the story the way I'd tell it to you if we were sitting around the table, drinking whiskey. You will feel as if you were talking to me. This, of course, diminishes the artistic value, but I don't think that the truth should be flavored with unnecessary writing.\nThis book is written in a different way, I promise you that much. \nWhy do I need your help? \nWell, if you've read this far, you've most likely noticed that English is not my first language. I am very comfortable with it, but it is not good enough to be published without editing. I want you to have the best possible experience while reading my account, and missing stuff such as \"the\" and \"a\" would take away from the full effect. If you've read my Reddit post, you've seen that I need help with editing.\nYour donations will go towards several necessary edits, formatting, publishing, and marketing. However, I made it my mission that edits can only change the spelling and grammatical errors and not the content. You will receive the raw version of my story. It will not be shaped to cater to a standard reader.\nSo, what are your rewards?\nI was torn between not having any rewards at all and creating these. I really didn't want to take away from the credibility of my story by creating t-shirts, posters, etc. However, you guys deserve to be rewarded for backing this book. You really do. So here we are. \nBookmark\nThis here is a specifically designed bookmark put on a quality, glossy paper. For a terrifying story, it's only right to have a terrifying bookmark. \nPoster\nI really like this one. Talented reader Rachel Schnapp drew this poster so the book can keep giving you shivers long after you're done reading. \nUSB\nNow this is a unique reward. The USB stick comes with all of my stories, drafts, and art. It includes unpublished incidents, undisclosed details, and never-before seen stories. Also, a lot more curses than the editors will allow in the book. \nT-Shirt\nThis unique t-shirt is made for anyone who is brave enough to wear it.The world we live in is strange, isn't it? One moment you are stalked by a devilish woman, while the next moment you're making a t-shirt about her. \nAnd finally, the reason this whole thing is happening... The book itself.\nThank you all, thank you very much. \n\n\n\nMost of the designs and videos are generous contributions of my talented friend, Aaron Rankin (aaronrr11@hotmail.co.uk).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe only step remaining in the whole process is editing.

When I turn 40, I'll have a 1-hour video that encapsulates my 30s.

Photo Credit: James Duncan Davidson\nI spent a couple of years saving enough money to afford taking a frugal year off from work.  I wanted to spend it doing all the important things I never had time for\u2026 travel, family, and my own personal creative projects.\nThis is 1 Second Everyday\u2026 me at age 30 (original):\nThis particular project has had such a profoundly positive impact on my life that I think everyone could benefit immensely from doing it too.  It's easy to do\u2014the process requires very little time or effort, but now I\u2019m trying to make it even easier, so everyone everywhere can experience this exciting project.  In collaboration with the extremely talented developers at Alchemy50 here in Brooklyn, I've spent the past few months developing an App that will make it extraordinarily easy for anyone to do too.\nhome screen\nThis project initially started as just a fun way to chronicle my year off, but it quickly turned into something more important.\nRecording one second every day suddenly allowed me to easily reflect back on my life\u2014to look back at my day-to-day decisions.  I started re-evaluating how I approached each day.  Quickly, I was able to see when a couple of days would go by when I hadn't done anything remotely interesting or outside my typical routine.\nWe have a tendency to pull cameras out when we're doing something fun or interesting, but we probably don\u2019t think to record when we're just sitting at home watching TV.  Recording a moment daily started encouraging me to wake up and seize each day.  \nQuick interview with CNN regarding 1SE:\nClick for video interview. [2 minutes long]\nI don't know about you, but I've always felt that I have a pretty bad memory.  If you asked me about a particular year\u2014say, 2007\u2014I really couldn't go into detail about it.  Sure I remember where I lived and where I worked.  I could probably find some photos to remember a couple of notable events by, but what about all the days in between?\nWhat did I do then?\nJust because we didn't do anything world-shaking one day, doesn't mean we should forget that day ever happened.  Perhaps use your less-enthralling days to inspire you to do something cool tomorrow.  Instead of letting the days, months, & years blend together into a hazy mush, make each day have meaning!  This project continues to provide me with priceless data on how I'm living my life, and it can do that for you, too.\nReliving the past month in 30 seconds\u2014or a year in 6 minutes\u2014provides a treasured perspective on life.  It holds me accountable for making every day count.\niPhone 5 Ready!\nSome App Features\nThe App accesses the videos in your camera roll, so you can start recording 1 Second Everyday RIGHT NOW!!

The App copies the moment and keeps it within the App itself.\nYour seconds are privately held on your phone.  You never have to share this with anyone if you don't want to.  The primary purpose of this App is to help you remember your own life.  Sharing is optional.\nAbout the Developers\nAlchemy50 is an application design & development studio in Brooklyn.  Their roots are in financial software, but they broke out of their corporate shackles three years ago to pursue more freedom in the types of projects that they can apply their talents to.  They've been fantastic to work with, and have been a closer partner with me on this project than I ever would have imagined. We've had hours of conversations debating the finer points of the project itself as an exercise, and the app design is a great reflection of the soul of the project as a result of that.\nAdditional thoughts\nDigital Cameras have made it easy to capture our lives, so most people are over doing it. And just because we can, doesn't mean we should. The limitations of rolls of film used to force us to prioritize what was worth capturing & what wasn't. I believe we should record less, & live more. Ruthlessly record only what's most important.\nSure people have been doing projects like these with photographs for years, but movement & audio are crucial to remembering a moment.  A photo can't capture my dad's voice\u2026 his laugh\u2026 or the way my mom's expression changes when I surprise her.\nThis project has produced an interesting side-effect: it encourages me to do at least one interesting thing every day.\nSend your compilations directly to social networks.\nI rarely capture the best moment of a day.  A lot of the seconds you see are actually from before or after a moment I want to remember, but seeing the moment I did capture still brings me back.  Trying to record the perfect second puts too much pressure on myself, and becomes a chore.  Wouldn't it be better to fully live an experience, than risk missing it while trying to capture it?\nWriting things down on a journal just doesn't generate the same results as actually having an audible/visual trigger to jolt your memory.\nI personally don't add filters, and I almost entirely shoot in first person perspective because I want to remember things exactly as I saw them with my own eyes.\nI like to think of each second as a \"Save Point,\" as if my past was a really complex video game.  Each \u201csave\u201d allows me to return to where I was and how I felt, and to connect the dots to remember un-captured events that transpired between any 2 recorded seconds.\nMy Story\nFebruary 20th, 1981 \nI am born in Peru. \n1987 \nMy family moves to New Jersey.\n1996-1999 \nI spend my high school years making 3D computer animated short films for fun.  At this time I begin to come into the fullness of my geekdom and movie buff-ness, and develop a passion for story telling, so short animated films become my way of exorcising those creative demons.\n2000-2004 \nI move to Brooklyn and enter Pratt Institute of Art and Design as a Computer Animation major.  My time is spent in being mesmerized by extraordinarily talented artists and I am immersed in non-stop inspiration.  While other animation majors students focus on courses in that field, I can't help but explore classes in a spectrum of artistic disciplines, including film, graphic design, and photography.  By the time I conclude my last class, I\u2019ve realized a most important lesson: all knowledge is connected.\n2004-2006\nI start working in advertising.\n2007\nI discover\u2014and become addicted to\u2014TED Talks.  Like many people who are drawn into the world of TED Talks, it becomes a life goal for me to be worthy of that stage someday.  To have an Idea Worth Spreading.\n2008\nI spend my rare free time working on personal creative projects and teaching classes at schools like Pratt & NYU.  One of these projects is directing a music video composed of 45,000 photographs.  The video ends up on the front page of Digg, Gizmodo, and Wired, and is staff-picked by Vimeo.  This is an exciting, exhausting time for me, but I\u2019m not in a situation that allows me to dedicate myself fully to this kind of work.\n2009\nI'm still in advertising\u2026 constantly working long nights and long weekends. I find myself increasingly dissatisfied creatively.  My social life is nonexistent, and don't get to spend enough time with my family.\nAnother 100+ hour work week.\nOctober 2009\nI watch a TED talk by Stefan Sagmeister\u2014The Power of Time Off.  My life is changed forever.  In his talk, Sagmeister (also a Pratt alumni) explains how his creativity has benefitted from shutting down his studio every seven years and taking a year off from work.  I'm instantly inspired.  I immediately start crunching numbers and looking at my savings.  I figure out how much I will have to save in order to take a frugal year off from work, and start saving saving saving.\nFeb 20th, 2011\nI turn 30 years old! I quit my job!  I start a year off from work so I can do all those things I\u2019ve never had time for, like travel, spend time with my family, and focus time on my own personal creative ideas.\nThe first of these ideas is a project I call \"1 Second Everyday.\"  The concept is simple: every day I record one second of video\u2014something that will help me remember that day.  I then begin chronologically compiling these tiny slices of my life into a single, continuous video.\nMarch 2011\nThe 1 Second Everyday idea begins as a fun way for me to chronicle my year off, but it quickly grows into something more important.  It allows me to easily reflect on my life and to look back at my decisions.  I start re-evaluating how I approached each day.\nAfter only a few weeks of compiling clips, I\u2019m able to look at the video and identify instances when several days go by without anything remotely interesting or outside my typical routine occurring.  It starts encouraging me to wake up & seize the day.\nI decide to continue doing this for the rest of my life.\nMarch 27th & 28th, 2011\nI forget to record a second. It torments me, but I learn a valuable lesson: when you're not doing anything interesting, it doesn't occur to you to capture the moment.\nApril 15rd, 2011\nA once in a lifetime opportunity pops up on my Facebook feed.  TED decides to hold the first ever TED talk auditions. I have doubts about anything in my life being worthy of the TED stage, but I\u2019m plagued by the thought that if I don\u2019t apply, I\u2019ll regret it for the rest of my life.\nApril 23rd, 2011\nIt occurs to me that my 1 Second Everyday project might be an \"Idea Worth Spreading.\"\nApril 25th, 2011 \n(thank to the 1SE project, I now know exact dates for these notable moments)\nI post my one-minute audition video to TED with just minutes to spare before the deadline.\nMay 6th, 2011\nA dream comes true, and my life changes forever.  I receive an e-mail from TED that out of hundreds of submissions, I'm one of 17 (including Reggie Watts!) to be chosen to audition live on stage at a special TED event in New York!  \nMay 24th, 2011\nTED talk day. Many fly in from around the world to audition, but I only have to take the subway.  I've never been more nervous.  Worst-case scenario\u2026 I tell myself to just speak from the heart.  I walk off stage convinced that I was horrible.  I unintentionally close off my talk by saying that I'd like to build an App that would make this easy for anyone to do.  Ultimately, I\u2019m happy just to have done my best and pleased that I now have a photo of me with a TED sign behind me. I\u2019m convinced it'll be my last Facebook profile photo ever.\nPhoto Credit: James Duncan Davidson\nJune 6th, 2011\nI fulfill a lifelong dream to drive around the USA to the West Coast, return through Canada\u2026 and do it slowly.  My friend Schoneck and I head off, and will not return to New York until 95 days later.\nJune 15th, 2011\nI get a phone call from TED, asking if I'd like to come speak at TED2012. I freak out!  Somehow, I\u2019m able to keep it a secret for the rest of the year.\nOctober 26th, 2011\nA catastrophic event hits my family.  I don't forget to record a second every day.  It devastates me.  Learn a valuable lesson, when you're going through horrible times, it doesn't occur to you to capture the moment\u2026 but my 1SE project forces me too.  \nDecember 24th, 2011\nAfter 2 months in the hospital, my sister-in-law returns home in time for Christmas.  In the months that follow, I'm grateful that I kept recording 1SE.  Reflecting on the bad times allows me to better appreciate the good times.  Before 1SE, this wasn't easy to do.\nJanuary 11th, 2012\nThe secret is out.  TED announces the speaker program for TED 2012. Now I can tell my friends and don\u2019t have to freak out alone!\nJanuary 25th, 2012\nFinally, after a long absence, I fly back to Peru to spend time with family.\nFebruary 20th, 2012\nI turn 31. It's a wrap for the first year of my lifelong 1SE project.\nFebruary 27th, 2012\nThe TED conference begins & I'm utterly overwhelmed in every conceivable level.  I meet some personal heroes of mine included Bill Nye (the science guy).  I mention to him how nervous I am about speaking at the end of the week.  He replies, \"if you weren't nervous, it wouldn't be worth doing\".\nMarch 2nd, 2012\nOne of the best weeks of my life comes to a close as the TED conference concludes, and I give my TED talk. \nTED 2012: Full Spectrum.

We just need your funding help to get this thing out of development and onto your phone!\nThe Future\nMy first priority after the completion of the iPhone App is to get an Android version out as well.\nAfter that\u2026 well...

I did it for a full year before I started using my own experience to design an App that would make it extraordinarily easy for anyone to do the same with their own life.\n\nWe've been hard at work on this App for several months\u2014making sure all the technical hurdles were out of the way before we launched this Kickstarter campaign, so that we could guarantee prompt delivery of the App & show it off in action.\n\nAt this point 80 - 85% of the base functionality is in the App. We still need to add that last 15 - 20%, which consist mainly of social integrations and the overlay of text on exported videos. Once that stuff is roughed in, we have to go back and polish everything in the app\u2026 the interactions, animations, layouts (so they match our designs), etc. \n\nFinally we'll put it through as rigorous a testing period as we can, trying to squash any remaining bugs before we submit to the Apple App Store. \n\nThe biggest challenges we've faced have been with the manipulation of video itself - mainly adding/overlaying text to the video. This has taken a lot of engineering discovery time, and thus far has not been solved when exporting videos. We've run into other strange things that have forced us to change course from the initial plans - a good example of this is that we initially thought we'd be able to use the native camera, but apparently it violates the Apple ToS to have an app launch the camera in Landscape mode, so we ended up having to build our own camera module. Although we believe this will work in our favor long term.\n\nA potential risk to our App delivery date (before 2013) could be the App Store approval process. Also, if we can't get the text overlay worked out in time. But we're confident we can.

These funds ensure that all of the base production costs of this album will be covered! What a relief! But also a great honor to be able to hire and work with all of the amazing people involved in making this album!!!\nAs I look further into how to get the music out to the world, I realize that promotional costs are potentially exponential. Seems there are two routes to getting your music out there beyond your immediate community (social networks, friends and family). One route is to hire a publicist, which costs at minimum about $2500 a month (eeeeeeeeek!). The second route is a bit more ninja style: order an extra however many copies of your album to give to radio stations and other media outlets so that people that have never heard of you, know about you.\nFor this reason, I am setting a stretch goal of $10,000. This will enable me to press an extra 1000 copies of my album to send to various media outlets that will help me promote this record.\nKickstarter itself has been an amazing promotional tool and I love that people that who did not know of me before are preordering the album and excited about the music!\nThanks for your help in keeping the word out there and for supporting this project!

Vari-Colored Songs is an album that has been waiting at least 5 years to be made! The moment is ripe and the momentum is strong!!! \nLucky for all of us, there is a small break in my touring schedule with the legendary Carolina Chocolate Drops, that will enable me to physically be in one place for a bit and focus on creating a gorgeous record to share with all of you beautiful people!!\nThe bulk of the recording will happen this January, 2013 at Joseph \"Joe Bass\" DeJarnette's Studio 808A in Floyd, Virginia. I've chosen to work with Joe because I know that he will be able to capture the nostalgic feeling of my songs while maintaining the authentic sound of my instruments and my voice. \nAside from my playing and my voice, some of the musicians who will be featured on the album include the incredible Rhiannon Giddens on vocals, lady killer Hubby Jenkins on bones, the frighteningly talented Don Vappie on tenor banjo, and master drummer Damas \"Fan Fan\" Louis (featured in the video above) on percussion. Seriously heavy hitters!! \nI was honored to receive an Artist Advancement grant for $3,000 from the Louisiana State Arts Council to cover the actual cost of recording. Still, there are several other costs associated with this record. \nThey are: \npaying musicians\nstudio time for overdubbing\nmixing\nmastering\nphotography\npackaging\ndesign\ntravel expenses\nMy $5,000 goal will enable me to cover these expenses.

This would be shown on the night of the premiere and also included as a special feature on the DVD copy of the film.\n-------------------------\nMustang Magic is not simply a story of wins and losses, but of a small community rallying around its team.\nFor residents of Three Oaks, Michigan, March recalls the wildly successful basketball teams of year\u2019s past. Playing in the area known as Harbor Country and led by Hall of Fame coach Jerry Schaffer, the River Valley Mustangs would play in three state championship games during his 32 years at the helm. The Mustangs would capture the 1979 Class C State Championship, as well as two Runner-Up finishes in 1981 and 1997.  There were not many back-to-back campaigns better than his 1987 and 1988 Mustangs, who captivated the attention of the entire area during a 47-5 run across those two seasons.\nWith this look into the impact high school sport has played in quintessential small town America, Mustang Magic explores those Friday nights that did matter -- when nearly the entire town showed up for home and away games, often outnumbering the opponent\u2019s supporters two-to-one. It also considers what changed that and whether it can be recaptured.\nThe effect of the film should be to not only showcase the spirit of small school sports, but to consider how it has changed in the past 20 years, and the positives it would create for a community if it could capture that spirit again.\nWhat are you funding?\nSo far, Mustang Magic has been a labor of love for Mark and his production team. Funds received from this project will help to offset the costs of production and to help cover the costs of the movie premiere on April 13, 2013.\nSome of the specifics:\nProduction Costs: Mark logged over 4,200 miles collecting the more than 30 interviews for the film.\nFinal Sound Correction: Every sound clip must be evened out and cleaned up by a sound professional.\nMusical Score: Chicago-based musician Chris Bryan of Counter Point Music is writing and composing an original soundtrack for Mustang Magic.\nPhotography: River Valley graduate Kevin Harrington and his studio have done AMAZING work, including the photographs you see above and below.\nB-Roll footage: Much of the B-Roll footage was shot and edited by River Valley graduate and Los Angeles-based editor Jason Honeycutt.\nDVD Replication: We are producing a minimum of 1,000 DVDs to be distributed on Kickstarter and at the premiere.\nFilm Marketing: This includes newspaper ads, radio ads, movie posters and other marketing materials.\nPremiere Weekend: We are in the final stages of securing a location in Southwest Michigan for the April 13, 2013 premiere. In addition, we will be holding three fundraising events for River Valley High School on the night before and the morning of the film.\nWho are you funding?\nMark Behnke - Mark is the owner of MB Video Productions and is the executive producer of Mustang Magic. He is a River Valley graduate and currently teaches video production at Hamilton High School in Hamilton, Mich.\nKevin Weed - Kevin is the lead writer of Mustang Magic, and he has contributed the vast majority of the film's narration. He worked four Olympic Games as a writer for NBC Sports, ESPN and IMAX Films. Currently, Kevin teaches journalism at Hamilton High School.\nCody Eding - Cody is the communications director for MB Video Productions and acts as the webmaster for markbehnkevideo.com. An award-winning sports writer, Cody has been published in the Denver Post and spent the summer of 2010 as a public relations intern for the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. He is a 2007 graduate of Hamilton High School.\nWhat is Kickstarter?\nKickstarter is a crowd funding website that enables the general population to fund creative projects that interest them. If you make a donation to Mustang Magic, you will receive the reward(s) listed under your donation range at or after the premiere on April 13, 2013.\nIf we do not reach our goal by August 14, we will NOT receive any of the donations.\nHow else can I help?\nPlease spread the word about both our Kickstarter campaign and Mustang Magic.

It is the stories of these men \u2014 together and apart \u2014 that drive the engine that is ARE WE NOT MEN?\nThis is your chance to be a part of the definitive Devo documentary:\n \u2022 WHY KICKSTARTER? We\u2019re in the process of making the film, but need your help to complete it. That\u2019s why we\u2019re reaching out to all DEVO fans to lend a hand. In return for your support, we've created some really cool rewards that we think reflects your help in breathing life into this film.\n \u2022 STATUS - 95% shot and currently editing. Estimated release date Spring 2013. Help us get this film edited, mixed, and to the festivals!\n\"This is the band of the future.\" \u2014David Bowie, 1977\nTHE FUTURE IS NOW! This is the first-ever documentary about one of the most influential bands of the 20th century. The true inside story of DEVO, told in their own voices, chock-full of never-before-seen clips, interviews, and testimonials. This is the D-E-V-O film fans have been waiting for.\nABOVE: David Bowie with DEVO, backstage in NYC, 1977\n\"Of all the bands who came fromthe underground and actually made it in the mainstream, Devo is the most challenging and subversive of all.\" \u2014Kurt Cobain\nWHO IS DEVO?\nThe trailblazing band Devo carved a unique niche apart from anything else in the rock, punk, or new wave landscape. Marrying ultra catchy electro-pop riffs to colorful, iconic imagery, they took the embryonic MTV by storm \u2014 most famously with the hit \u201cWhip It.\u201d Their matching BVDs and yellow chemical suits marked them as the video pioneers of a new era, and their trademark sound and style influenced music, culture and technology through the 1980s and \u201890s, paving the way for bands from Nirvana to Nine Inch Nails.\nBut Devo was more than highly stylized visuals and quirky riffs. They were conceptual. Political.\nDevo took their name from the concept of \"de-evolution.\u201d It posited that society, rather than progressing forward and celebrating the individual, was actually going backwards \u2014 thanks to dubious modern inventions like assembly lines and conveyor belts which turned people into mind-numbing drones. Herd mentality and the dysfunction of American corporate society was making mankind into an unthinking swarm of insects. It was a message Reagan-era America found increasingly hard to swallow, if they really even understood it at all.\nAs Devo sang in one of their other key songs from the era, \u201cFreedom of choice is what you got/Freedom from choice is what you want.\u201d\nToday, Devo\u2019s musings on humanity and culture seem sadly to have come true. We\u2019re all Devo! And so now they\u2019ve returned \u2014 less triumphant than rueful \u2014 with a new record and a new tour to \u2018play us out.\u2019\n\u201cWe\u2019re like the house band on the Titanic, playing as the ship goes down\u201d \u2014co-founder, Gerald Casale\nDEVO today, LEFT TO RIGHT: Casale, Casale, Freese, Mothersbaugh, Mothersbaugh\nTHE BAND MEMBERS: DEVO\n \u2022 Mark Mothersbaugh - One of the founding members of DEVO, Mark\u2019s passion has always been art of all kinds. In addition to being one of DEVO\u2019s lead singers, songwriters and the creator of many of the band\u2019s signature synthesizer sounds, Mark is also a visual artist. Mark is also the founder and lead composer at Mutato Muzika, a highly successful commercial music studio based in Los Angeles. Mark\u2019s music can be heard in film scores (Life Aquatic, The Tennenbaums, Rugrats, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs), television theme songs, video games and commercials. In all aspects, Mark Mothersbaugh permeates popular culture.\n \u2022 Gerald V. Casale aka Gorji, Chinaman, and Lt. Casanova - Casale, commonly referred to as \u201cJerry\u201d, is the other founding member of DEVO. He is the man behind DEVO\u2019s intricate bass parts, as well as the band\u2019s other lead singer and songwriter. In addition to these duties, Jerry masterminded the design of many of the band\u2019s now-iconic fashions, such as the red Energy Dome, plastic pompadour, and yellow radiation suits. Jerry also directed or co-directed many of DEVO\u2019s pioneering music videos. Jerry is also a well-known director of commercials, and music videos for other artists, including The Cars, Rush, A Perfect Circle, Foo Fighters, Soundgarden, and Silverchair.\n \u2022 Bob Mothersbaugh aka Clown - Brother of Mark, commonly referred to as \u201cBob 1\u201d, he is responsible for DEVO\u2019s signature guitar sound. Coming from a blues background, Bob 1 brought a rock edge to DEVO\u2019s innovative synthesizer-based music when the band first started. His guitar parts in such songs as \u201cSmart Patrol/Mr. DNA\u201d screamed in contrast to the band\u2019s self-perpetuated robotic image, netting fans that might not have otherwise paid the band any attention. He produces soundtracks for film and television, such as All Grown Up, How to Eat Fried Worms, and the animated Nickelodeon  TV series Rugrats as part of the company Mutato Muzika. In Kent State Vietnam protests, he was involved in burning the ROTC building down.\n \u2022 Bob Casale - Brother of Jerry, commonly referred to as \u201cBob 2\u201d, he is the backbone of DEVO. Throughout the band\u2019s early years, he would often switch between playing rhythm guitar and synthesizer. As the band grew more independent in later years, by necessity, Bob taught himself the ins and outs of audio recording and engineering. Bob is a well-respected producer and engineer, and his credits include David Byrne, The Vandals, and Andy Summers of The Police. In his spare time, Bob is known as quite a fine chef.\n \u2022 Josh Freese - The new kid (joined in 1996) - Josh is the music industry\u2019s number one most popular session drummer. He is well-known as a member of The Vandals, Nine Inch Nails, Guns N\u2019 Roses, Weezer, and A Perfect Circle. DEVO, however, holds a very special place for him. As a gift, while a very young boy, Josh received a copy of DEVO\u2019s Freedom of Choice LP. This is the album that inspired him to learn the drums. He began playing professionally at the age of 12. Now, 25 years later, Josh has appeared on over 300 records (many of which, he admits he\u2019s never heard).\n \u2022 Booji Boy - The infantile spirit of de-evolution. He is as old as the mountains, and he is yet unborn. Throughout his career with DEVO, he has died and been resurrected at least twice. When not helping the band to close their concerts, he is looked after by his babysitter, Mark Mothersbaugh. He is also an important member of the De-Evolutionary Army, smuggling secret documents to his father, and the army's leader, General Boy.\nABOVE: Booji Boy in his natural habitat\n\u201cWe\u2019re still waiting to get to where DEVO was in 1979.\u201d \u2014Dave Grohl\nTHE FILMMAKERS:\n \u2022 TONY PEMBERTON - DIRECTOR - The director of the Are We Not Men? film has written, directed, and edited short films, music videos, and features, and produced the 35mm feature film Beyond the Ocean that received a Jury Award nomination at Sundance in 2000. He's worked in Russia directing commercials, TV, and at an advertising agency in the late-1990s. He has been cited by Variety as one of \"10 Directors to Watch.\"\n \u2022 ROBERTA FRIEDMAN - PRODUCER - Roberta began her career in radio as producer of the KPFK series, \"Richland Woman.\" From there she segued into creating film titles and opticals, leading to special effects with Lucasfilm on Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back \u2014 specializing in sparks, matte work, and swords. Friedman continued in post-production working on such notable features as Ragtime, Days of Heaven, and Hair. \n \u2022 LEE DANIEL - DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY - Cinematographer Lee Daniel earned his chops collaborating with filmmaker and fellow Austin resident Richard Linklater, first on Slacker (1991), and then on a string of other successful projects (Dazed and Confused, Before Sunrise, Before Sunset, Fast Food Nation, and subUrbia). The Austin resident shot Margaret Brown\u2019s heart-wrenching study of Townes Van Zandt, Be Here to Love Me (2004), as well as director Keven McAlester\u2019s compelling tribute to Roky Erickson, You\u2019re Gonna Miss Me (2005).\nABOVE: \"Satisfaction,\" 1978\nFAQ:\nWhat happens if the money isn\u2019t raised in time? Every Kickstarter project must be fully funded before its time expires or no money changes hands. Your credit card or debit card will not be charged.\nHow much is shipping? Absolutely nothing in most cases \u2014 we'll take care of the costs. Whether you live in France or Japan, we'll ship it there for free if you are in the general vicinity of known places.   If you live off of the grid, or your area is complicated, we reserve the right to ask for the postage if excessive.\nHow will you use the extra money you're raising? We'd like to have the right tools and ingredients to make a great film about DEVO. The money we've raised so far covers only a fraction of the cost of making this film. Currently we are in production, so we are still looking for funds to cover the enormous cost of post production-editing, sound mixing, color correction etc. Every pledge helps us to avoid taking short cuts as we get one step closer to finishing this film about DEVO.\nIf I become an associate producer, how will we find out about the festivals to attend as part of your rewards program? We\u2019ll contact you personally. We\u2019ve attended a ton of them in the past, so we will be able to give you the full low down after we\u2019ve had a chance to talk to you.\nCan I add someone else's name to the credits instead of mine? Yes, once the campaign ends, Kickstarter will allow us to send out surveys requesting everyone's information, shipping addresses etc. You'll be able to submit someone else's name in lieu of yours at this time.\n> Please visit our websites for all the latest updates and behind the scenes photographs:\nhttp://Facebook.com/DEVOfilm\nhttp://Twitter.com/DEVOfilm\nhttp://Vimeo.com/DEVOfilm\nhttp://DEVOfilm.Blogspot.com\n[All sites operated by: Jeff E.

We are focused on delivering for you, first come first served. We can only promise OUYA by March to our Kickstarter backers.\nEngadget! PC World! Kotaku! The Guardian! Joystiq! Forbes! GameSpot! BusinessWeek! The Verge! Wired! IGN! The New York Times! Time!\nWe love console games.\nThere's something about a big HD TV and digital surround sound that fills up a living room. Shooters, platformers, sports games, arcade classics and experimental indie games just feel bigger on a TV screen. It's how most of us grew up gaming. \nBut maybe people are missing out.\nWe get it \u2013 smartphones and tablets are getting all the new titles \u2013 they're \"what's hot.\u201d The console market is pushing developers away. We\u2019ve seen a brain drain: some of the best, most creative gamemakers are focused on mobile and social games because those platforms are more developer-friendly. And the ones who remain focused on console games can\u2019t be as creative as they\u2019d like.\nDeep down, you know your best gaming memories happened in the living room.\nYou busted your ass just to find out the princess was \"in another castle.\" You fought bosses that told you repeatedly how much \"you suck.\" You taped a blanket to half of your screen so your friend couldn't see where you were. You traded the best players onto your team just so you could have the perfect season. And you did it all on the TV.\nIt's time to upend console gaming.\nLet\u2019s open this sucker up! It's time we brought back innovation, experimentation, and creativity to the big screen. Let\u2019s make the games less expensive to make, and less expensive to buy. With all our technological advancements, shouldn't costs be going down? Gaming could be cheaper!\nWe're handing the reins over to the developer with only one condition: at least some gameplay has to be free. We borrowed the free-to-play model from games like League of Legends, Team Fortress 2, Triple Town, and many others. Developers can offer a free demo with a full-game upgrade, in-game items or powers, or ask you to subscribe.\nOUYA: The revolution will be televised \nOUYA is a new game console for the TV, powered by Android.\nWe've packed this little box full of power. Developers will have access to OUYA's open design so they can produce their games for the living room, taking advantage of everything the TV has to offer. \nBest of all, OUYA's world-class controller, console, and interface come in one beautiful, inexpensive package. All the games on it will be free, at least to try.\nGreat games come from great developers.\nDevelopers can wave farewell to the roadblocks of bringing a console game to market. Anyone can make a game: every OUYA console is a dev kit. No need to purchase a license or an expensive SDK. It's built on Android, so developers already know how it works. \nThat doesn't mean OUYA is an Android port. You can create the next big title in your bedroom \u2013 just like the good old days! Who needs pants!? \nOUYA could change AAA game development, too. Forget about licensing fees, retail fees, and publishing fees. \nAnd developers agree:\n\"This has the potential to be the game developer\u2019s console. It's about time!\" -- Brian Fargo (founder of inXile) \n\u201cWho wouldn't want a beautiful piece of industrial design that sells for $99, plugs straight into your TV, and gives you access to a huge library of games?\" \u2013 Jordan Mechner (creator of Prince of Persia, Karateka) \n\u201cIf OUYA delivers on the promise of being the first true open gaming platform that gives indie developers access to the living room gaming market, yes that is a great idea. We will follow the development of OUYA and see how it resonates with gamers. I could see all current Mojang games go on the platform if there's a demand for it.\u201d \u2013 Mojang (developer of Minecraft) \n\"I'm excited for OUYA! I am a firm believer that there is always room to challenge the status quo.\" -- Jenova Chen (thatgamecompany, creator of flOw, Cloud, and Flower)\n\u201cThe prospect of an affordable, open console -- that's an idea I find really exciting.\u201d -- Adam Saltsman (Semi Secret, creator of Canabalt)\n\n\"Our games will work so well on a TV, we just need an easy way to get them there. OUYA could be it.\" -- Marek Rabas (Madfinger Games)\n\n\"An open game console that gives independent game developers the flexibility to experiment with their games and business models on the TV, is something that's long overdue.\" \u2013 David Edery (Spry Fox, creator of Triple Town)\nDesign matters.\nWe believe a great console requires a great user experience. We are working with the award-winning designer, Yves Behar, and his firm fuseproject (designer of the Jambox).\nWe are designing the controller to be a love letter to console gaming. It will have everything you've learned to love: fast buttons, triggers, laser-precise analog sticks, a D-Pad \u2013 and it will have a touchpad for any games making the trek from mobile or tablet to the TV. It'll be just the right weight. We are working with select developers to play-test the controller through development.  We call it 'the Stradivarius of controllers,' and we hope developers will be inspired to take gameplay to a new level with it.\nHackers welcome.\nHave at it: It's easy to root (and rooting won't void your warranty). Everything opens with standard screws. Hardware hackers can create their own peripherals, and connect via USB or Bluetooth. You want our hardware design? Let us know. We might just give it to you. Surprise us!\nSpecifications:\nTegra3 quad-core processor \n1GB RAM \n8GB of internal flash storage\nHDMI connection to the TV, with support for up to 1080p HD \nWiFi 802.11 b/g/n \nBluetooth LE 4.0 \nUSB 2.0 (one) \nWireless controller with standard controls (two analog sticks, d-pad, eight action buttons, a system button), a touchpad \nAndroid 4.0\nETHERNET! (Announced by Muffi 7/18)\nStandard OUYA Console\nLimited-Edition Kickstarter Console\nIt's entertainment beyond gaming. \nBecause OUYA is based on Android, any app developer could publish their Android app to OUYA. The possibilities are limitless, and conversations with potential partners are already underway. Here\u2019s our first: do you like watching StarCraft, or League of Legends? Watch Twitch.TV on your OUYA. \nWe've come a long way already. The user interface and industrial designs are far along. Our prototype is up and running. What we have left to do is simple, but it's expensive. (We\u2019re looking at you Mark Cuban! Woz! Help us out.)\nAll we need is you. \nWith your help, we need to: \nConvert our prototype to production-ready models and get all the regulatory approvals (yeah, we need these to sell them)\nDeliver developer kits (for early developers so we can have games on day one, though every console will include an SDK once we launch)\nPlace our first production orders (we are working with a manufacturing firm with lots of game hardware experience, but we need to know how many to make!)\nIdeally, fund some initial game development (i.e., 1st-party games)\nAnd if you\u2019re international, we want your help too\u2026gaming is global, and we will get you OUYA. We still have a lot to figure out in regards to rights and countries, but it can be done. Look what we've accomplished already! \nShow the world, through your numbers, that you're out there.\nShow them you're ready to level the playing field. Enlist others.

I think that's too much, especially for students who have to choose between food and the rent, two or three times a year, like a lot of my students. Yet the cost of these books never goes down, because students are a captive market.\nSo, I've been writing my own textbook, so that my students don't have to buy one. I'd like to expand and improve it and then make it available to the whole world, for free.\nThis Kickstarter campaign will allow me to bring in more contributors, get more research resources, and hire designers and artists and translators, so that we can put together a very high quality teaching tool, and make it available to every student in the world.\nThe final product will be a series of pdf downloads for students, and a series of powerpoint slideshows and a test bank for teachers. I will also create a print-on-demand hardcopy option for those who want one, to be sold at the lowest  possible price.\nAnd the more money we raise, the more we will do. If we go beyond the target of $5,000 then we'll be able to create more foreign-language editions, and create an audio version. If we raise a lot more than the target, we'll create a series of YouTube videos, or possibly a smartphone app, all depending on how much is raised.\nSo, if you agree that college textbooks are far too expensive, and you would like to help lower the cost of education for people in need; if you believe that knowledge is exciting, and should be as accessible as possible to as many people as possible; if you think that good critical thinking skills really do matter; then please support this project.\nThank you, most sincerely, for your support!\nOur First Stretch Goal:\nIf we raise $10,000, then I will create an Audiobooks edition, in the form of a series of MP3's, and I will create a French language edition.  All backers will receive the text in their choice of English or French.\nFurthermore, I will email the finished MP3's to everyone who pledges $50 or more.\nOur Second Stretch Goal:\nIf we raise $15,000, I will hire a few actors and we will create a dramatic reading of some of the works of Plato, including the Apology, the Euthyphro, and important scenes in the Republic. These works are read by just about every first-year philosophy student in the world, so they are good choices. I will also produce a study guide to accompany them.\nI'm also open to suggestions about other texts to dramatize this way. Please use the comments section under Update #6 to make suggestions.

That got me thinking - what if we did the opposite?: take widely-known modern electronic music hits and recreate them with an ensemble that could have existed 100 years ago.\nDaft Punk seemed an obvious choice - their music is great, it's accessible and widely known, and it's super danceable. What better way to reformat their tunes than the irresistable funky goodness of a New Orleans brass band?\nI plan to arrange Daft Punk's 4 biggest hits for brass band.  I've already written the arrangement for Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger.  The other 3 tunes I'll be doing are: One More Time, Around the World, and Da Funk.\nOnce I have the arrangements, I'll hire select musicians from several favorite N.O. bands and bring them into the studio to record.  From there I'll edit, mix, and send it off to be mastered.  In the end, it will be available as a download and as a vinyl record.\nWhat the money is for: There are several major expenses here:  hiring musicians for the recording sessions, licensing fees to the folks that own the original songs and legal fees for having a lawyer obtain those licenses, paying for the album graphics, mastering, vinyl manufacturing, and a handful of other miscellany.  It adds up.\nExtended Goals:\n$14,000 - if we his this mark I'll hire photographer Donovan Fannon to come shoot the sessions, post tons of the photos on line for you all to see, print an assortment of 5x7s, and include one print with each copy vinyl record that goes out to backers.  Also, I'll make all backer vinyl records a limited signed & numbered edition.  Only backers will receive the signed & numbered versions, the edition quantity limited by the # of records issued as backer rewards.\n$16,000 - if backing gets this high, I'll do the same as above, but upgrade the  prints included w/ the records to 8x10 instead of 5x7.\nLinks:\nPHONEFT example\nElectronola - my first kickstarter project\n\n\nThis is a tribute record.

Siuda", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Hi, Neal Stephenson here. My career as an author of science and historical fiction has turned me into a swordsmanship geek. As such, I'm dissatisfied with how swordfighting is portrayed in existing video games. These could be so much more fun than they are. Time for a revolution.\nIn the last couple of years, affordable new gear has come on the market that makes it possible to move, and control a swordfighter's actions, in a much more intuitive way than pulling a plastic trigger or pounding a key on a keyboard. So it's time to step back, dump the tired conventions that have grown up around trigger-based sword games, and build something that will enable players to inhabit the mind, body, and world of a real swordfighter.\nCLANG will begin with the Queen of Weapons: the two-handed longsword used in Europe during late medieval and early renaissance times. This is a well-documented style that has enjoyed a revival in recent years thanks to the efforts of scholars and martial artists worldwide.\nAt first, it'll be a PC arena game based on one-on-one multiplayer dueling (which is a relatively simple and attainable goal; we don't want to mess this up by overreaching). Dueling, however, is only the tip of the sword blade. During the past few years, we have been developing a rich world, brimming with all manner of adventure tales waiting to be written--and to be played. In conjunction with 47 North, Amazon.com's new science fiction publishing house, we've already begun publishing some of those stories, and we have plenty more in the hopper. Once we get CLANG off the ground we intend to weave game and story content together in a way that'll enhance both the playing and the reading experience.\n\"How will this be different than SoulCalibur?\" you ask. .....\nLow-latency, high-precision motion controller: Critical to a satisfying sword fight is fast, accurate response. This is especially important for CLANG given the depth and complexity of moves that are used in real sword arts. Initially, CLANG will make use of a commercial, third-party, off-the-shelf controller that anyone can buy today\nDepth: Roundhouse swings and crude blocks just aren't enough. Real sword fighting involves multiple attacks delivered from different stances, pommel strikes, grappling, feints, and parries.\nExpandability: Implementing the longsword style will oblige us to construct a toolkit that can then be used--by us, or by others--to create other examples of what we're calling MASEs (Martial Arts System Embodiments). If your thing is Japanese kenjutsu or Viking sword-and-board, then in principle CLANG should support it.\nRaising an army (or, in this case, building an enormous story-driven video game) is an expensive proposition and can take a number of years. In keeping with the scrappy, ragtag band of adventurers model, we are building this larger vision one step at a time. The next step is to build a functional proof of concept in the form of an exciting prototype we can share with you and use to achieve our next level of funding--which will enable us to provide more character models, more environments, and more MASEs. Which is to say, other weapons and styles from other places and eras. We are building a framework that can be expanded as far and as deeply as possible. We have, after all, several thousand years of martial history to draw from.              \nIn Which Neal goes into detail, as is his wont, regarding Clang:\nPlease read Technical Update #1 for details on CLANG design elements such as MASEs and In/Out of System movements.\nTechnical Update #2 covers our plans for the combat UI.\nIn Technical Update #3 Neal discusses timing, lag and tachypsychia.\nTechnical Update #4 goes more deeply into Sword Sync and Force Feedback.\nVideo update for reaching 50% of our goal.

This video project will explore, analyze and deconstruct some of the most common tropes and stereotypes of female characters in games.

With my video web series Feminist Frequency,  I look at the way women are portrayed in mass media and the impact they have on our culture and society.\nTHE PROJECT\nWith your help, I\u2019ll produce a 5-video series (now expanded to 12 videos) entitled Tropes vs Women in Video Games, exploring female character stereotypes throughout the history of the gaming industry.  This ambitious project will primarily focus on these reoccurring tropes: \nDamsel in Distress - Video #1\nThe Fighting F#@k Toy - Video #2\nThe Sexy Sidekick - Video #3\nThe Sexy Villainess - Video #4\nBackground Decoration - Video #5\n1st Set of Stretch Goals Achieved!\nVoodoo Priestess/Tribal Sorceress - Video #6\nWomen as Reward - Video #7\nMrs. Male Character - Video #8\nUnattractive Equals Evil - Video #9\nMan with Boobs - Video #10\nPositive Female Characters! - Video #11\n2nd Stretch Goal Achieved! \nLet's Bump up the Production Quality!\n3rd Set of Stretch Goals Achieved!\nTropes vs Women in Video Games Classroom Curriculum \nVideo #12 - Top 10 Most Common Defenses of Sexism in Games\nEach video will be between 10 and 20 minutes long and available online for free for everyone and anyone to watch, share and use.\nCreating these videos take a lot of time and money to produce.

This previous series was highly successful and shared all over the web.  Not only did it provide people the language to understand the media they were engaging with, but it's even served as a guide for some professional writers and media creators to actively avoid gendered character stereotypes and create more in-depth, and more engaging female characters.  \nHelp me create another successful video series that will contribute to and help amplify the existing conversations happening about female characters in games and maybe even get the attention of the gaming industry to start creating more interesting, engaging and complex female characters, that avoid the standard boring cliches.\nVisit FeministFrequency.com to see examples of my previous video work.\nKickstarter doesn't have subtitle integration with their videos so I've posted a full transcript of the video here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #43", "update_userinfo": "Free Classroom Curriculum is here!", "update_content": "Hi everyone!\nWe are thrilled to announce that an outstanding curriculum supporting the Tropes vs. Women in Video Games series is now available!

Stine's \u201cGoosebumps.\u201d I love the idea of fresh monthly content to read and enjoy.\nThat's why, with the help of ebook publishing and readers like you, I want to create a new monthly serial that both kids and adults can look forward to.\n\nCamp Myth is a summer camp built to teach young mythological creatures about the cultures and dangers of their amazing world. Minotaurs, Dryads, Merfolk, Centaurs \u2013 you name it! For six weeks, these children live and work together in order to earn merit badges and prove their worth to the mythic community.\n\nBut for Felix, a mischievous Fae with a knack for getting into trouble, camp means nothing more than a chance to break free from his overprotective parents and enjoy a few weeks without responsibilities. That is, until a series of accidents turn camp life upside-down, and some of the other campers start disappearing from the grounds.\n\nTogether with his cabin-mates, Argee \u2013 the world's only nerdy Cyclops \u2013 and Moxie \u2013 an orphaned Kitsune unable to control her shape-shifting powers, Felix will meet learn about mythological creatures, what it really means to grow up, and how friendship can transcend race and culture.\n\nEvery month, there will be a new volume of Camp Myth, clocking in at about 20,000 words. Each book will be named after a new merit badge, and will focus on Felix, Argee, and Moxie attempting to earn that badge, while at the same time learning more about the overall mystery of Camp Myth.\n\nVolume One will be titled, \u201cPhoenix Watching,\u201d and will follow the characters as they first arrive at Camp Myth, and try to earn what looks to be the easiest badge. But it doesn't take long for the gang to discover that Camp Myth is anything but a free ride.\nUpcoming Volumes in this series will include:\n\nVolume #2: Kraken Fishing \u2013 A relaxing day at Leviathan Lake turns into a race to catch a baby Kraken... until the Mama Kraken decides to get payback!\n\nVolume #3: Cyclopean Archery \u2013 Determined to impress his older siblings, Argee convinces Felix and Moxie to earn Camp Myth's Archery merit badge... Cyclops style!\n\nVolume #4: Golem Building \u2013 Forget about cars made from blocks of wood! In this volume, the trio compete in Camp Myth's annual Golem Derby.\n\nAs of now, I have four of these books drafted, with an outline for at least half a dozen more. But none of this will be possible without your support. Art, editing, publishing, distribution, Camp Myth-themed goods \u2013 it all adds up. But hopefully I can raise enough to give this series the attention it deserves, and have the first book released this July. \n\nWith Camp Myth, you'll see the results of your donation in a matter of weeks, not months or even years like some other campaigns.\n(Illustrations by Jay Camay)\n\nCREDENTIALS\nWhat makes me qualified to write this series? Well, I've been writing for years, and \u2013 including pieces accepted for unreleased projects - I've been featured in nearly two dozen different publications, both online and in print, from anthologies, to magazines, to websites, to podcasts. I even have fiction published in Newfoundland's current 8th grade textbook. I'm passionate about the industry, I know the target market, and I have experience and success with writing for several different age groups. \n\nCAMP MILESTONES (AKA: Stretch Goals)\nSummer camps are also about community. In that spirit, Camp Myth #1 features several \u201cCamp Milestones\u201d - rewards that will be given to all backers should a certain level of funding past the goal amount be reached. There are six in all, and the specifics of the next reward will be revealed when the previous goal has been hit. Donate, spread the word, and unlock new rewards for everyone!\n\nUNLOCKED: $5,000 \u2013 \u201cPhoenix Watching\u201d merit badge for all backers $25 and higher.\n\nUNLOCKED: $6000 - \"The Art of Camp Myth #1\" PDF for all backers. \n\nCamp Milestone #3: $7,000 - All copies of Camp Myth #1 become hardcover.\n\nCamp Milestone #4: $9,000 - Ebook copy of Camp Myth #2: Kraken Fishing for all backers. \n\nCamp Milestone #5: Locked\n\nCamp Milestone #6: Locked\n\nREFER A FRIEND & THE MYTHIC CAMPER AWARD\n Summer camps are about friendship, and connecting with other people in order to accomplish a common goal. That's why Camp Myth #1 will use an innovative \u201cRefer a Friend\u201d system.\n\nIf you convince another person to match or exceed your donation, you'll be moved up one reward tier at no additional cost to you. Just have that person send me a quick message confirming that you were the one who let them know about Camp Myth, and you'll get more rewards just for spreading the love.\n\nBut that's not all. Whichever backer manages to raise the highest amount of referred donations will given Book One's \"Mythic Camper\" Award. Not only will they be credited in the final product, but they will also receive the $500 Tier Rewards absolutely free!\n\nThat's right! You don't need to have the fattest wallet to earn the coolest swag. There's going to be a winner - guarenteed - so why not you?\n\nNot everyone has a zillion dollars to support these types of campaigns, and I totally understand that.

I also reached out to some new artists I've never worked with, like the german sculptor Heide Hatry, brooklyn writer/artist Tao Lin, and many others. but best of all I talked some of my musician friends (like DJ spooky, kristin hersh from throwing muses, conrad keely from \u2026trail of dead, and one of my songwriting HEROES robyn hitchcock) into making art which you'll be able to see:\n\u2022 in a hard-bound ART BOOK (similar to the \"Who Killed Amanda Palmer\" book) which will contain the art, photos, lyrics, behind-the-scenes looks at some of the artist's creations, and much more\n\u2022 LIVE and IN PERSON on our ART SHOW TOUR June-August (we'll be hitting Berlin, London, Brooklyn, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Boston)\n\nthis is a package i dreamed up for people who like to get SHIT IN THE MAIL, CONSTANTLY. when i was a teenager i used to love 7\"-of-the-month-clubs, punk rock style, and fanzines that would arrive with weird ziploc bags full of crap in them. if you're a freak for surprises...this is the package for you. over the course of the summer, you'll get a series of 5 packages (sent every few weeks starting in july). the final package will include the deluxe backer-edition of the album, and packages 1-4 are going to be limited edition 7\" vinyl that feature some of the amazing album artwork. and with your 7\" singles, i'll also include an ARTS&CRAFTS SURPRISE. i wanted to stay away from things like shirts and posters and crap...i wanted to make things for you to DO, and MAKE, and SHARE back at me. i'm really proud of the bizarre things we thought up for this. the shipping of multiple packages all summer long is going to cost us a lot, and that's reflected in the price.\n\"BUT ((SAD FACE)) I DON'T HAVE A TURNTABLE....\"\nTHEN BUY ONE FROM US. YOU KNOW YOU WANT ONE.\nVINYL IS BACK. we're going to buy and decorate some really high-quality Crosley USB-turntables and include them in higher-priced packages JUST FOR THIS REASON.\nat some point this summer Cassandra Long (who also happens to be my housemate), Meghan Howland, and a few of the other Album Artists are going to have a massive 2-day party in boston during which we get together and paint all these turntables for you. your excuse not to buy vinyl IS GONE! POOF!\n\n\nlast july, I started randomly drawing people who tweeted black and white photos of themselves to me...with a sharpie of course, because I always have one on my person, because THAT is the secret to being a successful musician. I love to draw these in quiet moments on the road or at home before the mayhem of the day starts. I figured I would extend the offer to be a sharpie-rendition of ANYTHING you send - it doesn't have to be you...it could be a loved one, a lost one, a place, a favorite mug...go crazy. we'll pack it up really nicely and send it to you right along with all the music & art book stuffs. here are some that i've done in the past (for twitter-folk @sermoiii and @SDuPreeBemis):\n\ni'll have neil explain this one, because he writes gooder than me. please be amused at the fact he is, therefore, referring to himself in the third person:\n\n\"To make art for 'The Bed Song', Neil wrote a script, as if Neil were making a script for a five panel graphic novel, and gave it to Kyle. Kyle and Neil talked, emailed, Kyle took photos, and the final sequence of five shots that made 'The Bed Song' art was created.\nWhich left us with a lot of amazing photos of people in beds that we didn't use. And we wanted people to see them. So we are making a limited edition book, with writing by Neil and photographs by Kyle and lyrics by Amanda. Unless you are one of the models in the beds, Neil, Kyle or Amanda, this Kickstarter will probably be the only way you can get one, I'm afraid. There will be a limited, signed, numbered edition of 666 copies, with a very small number of additional unnumbered artists proofs.\nWarning. The book contains naked people, naked emotions and unmade beds.\"\n\nTO KICK OFF THIS YEAR OF MADNESS, in which we'll be touring ALL OVER THE WORLD, we're going to unveil the new material and the original large-format album art/paintings LIVE in six select cities: BOSTON, NEW YORK, LA, SAN FRANCISCO, LONDON and BERLIN. in every city, we've PARTNERED with a local ART GALLERY or EVENT SPACE, where we'll hang the art on beautiful walls for y'all to come and admire in person. then we'll have a special kick-off ART OPENING just for kickstarter supporters who back the event. we'll load you down with odd gifts, hugs, and drinks (if you're of age...if not, root beer throwdown) & the band will play a special acoustic set in the Art Space. we're keeping these openings limited to about 100-150, even in spaces where we could fit more people. one of my favorite things about this is that i'll get to MEET you guys in person, and thank you for your backing with a kiss. i'm hoping that our night together, among the art, making acoustic music with the band and sharing wine, will be totally fucking magical & unforgettable.\n\nin each city, we'll ALSO be playing a SMALL plugged-in rock show. the rock shows are open to the general public and have almost all sold out, but the art show kickstarter backers will have guaranteed guest-list to those performances, as well. the tickets to these smaller rock shows will be HARD to get, so backing in your city is a surefire way to know you'll get in.\n\n\neven though we've assembled a tasty variety of backer rewards - $1 all the up to $10,000 - i also know that there are some of you you are HELLA RICH and who would like to put more money towards the project. i know because...i've been asked. SO: for you more invest-y types, i am proud to announce THE LOANSPARK COLLECTIVE.\n\nwith LOANSPARK, i'm not asking for donations; i'm asking for people to step forward as high-level patrons and help out with interest-free loans that will be fully paid back after the album is cranked out and earning money. in exchange for your high-rolling loan, i will make some very special art and/or do a performance to support a charity you're passionate about. it's a slightly mad idea, but if it works, we may be onto a new form of patronage that could work for other artists...so i'm very happy to take a crack at it.\n\nall the info is up on the LOANSPARK WEBSITE, which we've launched in conjunction with this project:\n_________\n\nand that my dear comrades, is it.\n\nWE ARE THE MEDIA: as soon as you support this kickstarter, PLEASE TELL EVERYONE YOU'VE DONE IT, AND SPREAD THE LINK FAR AND WIDE.\nthank you, thank you, thank you.\nLOVE,\namanda\nfucking\npalmer\n\namandapalmer.net | @amandapalmer\np.s. a random note about the video: i DID pick up all those fucking signs i'd drawn. i did not leave them in the street in melbourne. we'll figure out what to do with them later...by the time we finished shooting (we did 2 takes), most of the cards had been run over by a car or a bicycle.\n\nBand photos and KS video by Jim Batt | @battsignal\nCollage of the ART (from l-r, top to bottom): Kyle Cassidy, Tony Albert, Cynthia von Buhler, Cassandra Long, David Mack, and Tony Albert\nAFP/Keytar photo by Andrius Lipsys\nAdditional images/editing/maintenance by Sean Francis | @indeciSEAN", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #27", "update_userinfo": "heya, it's been a minute. long catch-up letter...& i've got a new album", "update_content": "hola everybody!!!\nGreetings from upstate new york. i\u2019ve missed you.\nthis is an email to my long-lost, wonderful 24,883 ttheatre Is evil\u201d kickstarter backers. long time, no see\u2026.\nTL;DR: i am using patronage now. it is awesome & has changed m life. have a new record out. my patrons get tour ticket access for TWO MORE DAYS, & the cool merch. if you still want to help me make art, join at https://www.patreon.com/amandapalmer for as little as $1/month."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #26", "update_userinfo": "\"the bed song book\" is not imaginary, it's coming!!

We hope you'll come along for the ride by pledging to fund our project in exchange for some exclusive rewards.  It\u2019s an ambitious project, but with your help we will make it happen. It's amazing what passion, hard work, and community support can accomplish when great food, especially handmade Neapolitan pizza pies are involved.  We created this Kickstarter page to make it easy to support our project.\nWhen we reach our fundraising goal, you get the cool stuff and we get the financial support we need to complete our project. If we don't reach the goal, you don't lose any money (or get any cool stuff).  We can raise more than our target ($5k), so keep pledging if you want more cool stuff!\nHere's a look at our Bare Knuckle Pizza T-shirt and Sticker:\nWait, what will Bare Knuckle Pizza be about?  Can you explain?\nBare Knuckle Pizza\u2014 will be a 'no frills' wood-fired mobile pizza cart taking Neapolitan pies to the streets, literally. Founded in 2012, BK Pizza will bring Neapolitan-style pizza to the Bay Area by only using local and fresh organic ingredients as much as possible.  BK Pizza will be serving the San Jose/South Bay/Santa Clara Co. community by offering our pies at local farmer's markets. In addition, we\u2019ll be a catering parties and events per request.\nCheck out our website: www.bareknucklepizza.com for more info.\nViet Nguyen\u2019s journey to becoming an artisan Neapolitan pie-maker began back in 1996 when he learned a basic pizza dough recipe from his sister in Indiana.  He followed his heart to California and then to NYC where he discovered how true Neapolitan pies are made in Brooklyn.  He was inspired to rework his original pizza dough recipe based upon his visit to the \u201cMecca\u201d of Neapolitan pies.  After two years of experimenting and offering his pies to his family and friends, Viet finally created a Neapolitan pie crust that he\u2019s proud to serve to the community. \nBare Knuckle Pizza pays respect and homage to the orginal Neapolitan pies from Italy and Brooklyn.  We use the finest ingredients as our foundation, whether it's locally made flour or fresh mozz, artisan cheeses, & basil, plus imported San Marzano tomatoes.   \nHere's a trial run of the BK Pizza dough in a wood-fired oven....It was awesome! \nWe created this Kickstarter campaign to help fund the final push to open the mobile-pizza car/truck and to get our friends, family, coworkers, acquaintances, and local pizza lovers involved through a sense of collaborative ownership.  Nearly everyone we know has thought about being a part of a food project one day... now is your chance to own a small \u201cpiece of the pie!\u201d  By funding our project this way, we can personally meet, thank, and celebrate with everyone who becomes a backer.  \nThis is a big project for me.  I've personally invested my own savings in the project/mobile wood-fired cart, but we need a bit more to reach the finish line!  Money raised through Kickstarter will primarily be used to purchase equipment and supplies to bring our mobile wood-fired pizza oven to San Jose farmers\u2019 markets.  We're already in the process of getting the wood-fired oven, but we still need to purchase all the extras: the tent, pizza paddles & peels, wood-fired pizza oven supplies, wood, tables, signage, coolers, permits, licenses, certificates, etc.  Help us make the South Bay a place where we continue to build upon its food culture by supporting our project today.  We look forward to thanking you in person!\n\nAny donation helps\nRemember Kickstarter is all or nothing, so if we don\u2019t reach our $5,000 dollar goal in twenty-seven days, we will not get any funds from any of you. We\u2019ve worked really hard to put together some exciting rewards which are all listed at the right of the page. We can't wait to serve you delicious Neapolitan pies at farmers\u2019 markets or cater your party/event in the greater South Bay.   \nCredits\nI have some awesome friends and family who made this Kickstarter page possible. I would like to thank Amal Mongia, www.amalphotography.blogspot.com, who helped shoot, direct and edit the video with me, and everyone who helped with the ideas, rewards, and inspiration for this project: Christine Ngo; Colleen Ngo; Van Tran; Mom; Dad; Uncle Minh; Kinneret Alexander; Christina Russell; Mike & Thao Nelson; Jack & Noah Nelson; Maddy, Cooper, & Lucy Mitchell; Chris & Hoang Mitchell; Rieder & Caitlien MacDonald; Lien & Todd MacDonald; Ellie & Katie Nguyen; Hung & Heather Nguyen; Patrick Ngo, Trung Ngo; My Indiana plus Eastbay Fam & Friends; Pete at Pizzaiolo; Manh & Kirstin Nguyen; Tony Mai; Betty Nguyen; Tony Nguyen; Dashiell Skuse; and Danny \u201cDandiggity\u201d Le.

She'd rather be left to her own devices \u2013 literally \u2013 inventing things and solving math problems and ignoring people altogether.\nShe's also forced to study alongside the imaginative girlie-girl Mary, who's always going on about romance and exotic travels.  Fortunately, Mary's appetite for adventure leads her to propose the two girls open a detective agency, and when an heiress shows up with a case about a missing diamond, it's the perfect puzzle to coax Ada out of her shell.\nThis is the made up story about two very real girls \u2013 Ada, the world's first computer programmer, and Mary, the world's first science fiction author \u2013 caught up in a steampunk world of hot-air balloons and steam engines, jewel thieves and mechanical contraptions.  For readers 8-12.\nThis is a pro-math, pro-science, pro-history and pro-literature adventure novel for and about girls, who use their education to solve problems and catch a jewel thief.  Ada and Mary encounter real historical characters, such as Percy Shelley, Charles Babbage, Michael Faraday, and Charles Dickens \u2013 people whom the girls actually knew.  If Jane Austen wrote about zeppelins and brass goggles, this would be the book.\n\nWhy \"Wollstonecraft\"?  Mary names the detective agency after her mother, the famous feminist writer. If this is the kind of book you'd like to see, please support this project.\nBOOK ONE: Mary & Ada found a detective agency in 1826 London, and their first case involves an heiress with a missing pendant, and her clearly-innocent maid who has confessed to the crime.\nBOOK TWO: Joined by Mary's step-sister Jane and Ada's half-sister Allegra, the girls (aided by 19th century scientist Mary Somerville)  tackle a case of mistaken identity and break into (and out of) a notorious asylum to stop a swindler.\nBOOK THREE: Ada's sudden illness force the girls to split up and tackle three baffling cases that are clearly unrelated \u2013 or are they?\nBOOK FOUR: The Wollstonecraft girls are recruited by the famous dinosaur-hunter Mary Anning to investigate the disappearance of her friend, fossil-collector Etheldred Bennet.\nUPGRADES: EVERYONE who has pledged for the first e-book or above will now ALSO get an e-book of Book Two, and all $25 pledges and up will get the first three e-books and an autographed cover postcard, which I can sign as you request.  As more people come on board, things get bigger for everyone. Thank you for bringing the world of Wollstonecraft to life!\n\nAt $70,000, I'll write a Teacher's Guide for the first three books and make it available as a free download. UPDATE: WE DID IT! The Teacher's Guide is now unlocked, and we have the budget to make it a great tool.  Thank you so much!\nNEW SPONSOR LEVEL: At the $300 pledge level, the school or library of your choice will receive the first 3 books in paperback, and you'll receive a bronze Victorian \"W\" pin.  \nFUN NEW STRETCH GOAL: A larger budget means I can commit to writing more stuff, specifically An Adventure of Choices Made By You (because that, um. other term is \u00a9), but when we hit $90,000 I'll write such an adventure, in the second person, where the reader makes choices to solve a case set in the World of Wollstonecraft \u2013 and I'll give it away for free on the website. Let's see if we can do this!\nA huge thank-you to Kevin at Airship Ambassador for producing this project!\nAnd another huge thank-you to Claire Robertson (Loobylu.com) for the fantastic character sketches \u2013 she'll be designing the cover.\n\nAnd further thank-yous to those of you who've already expressed support via Facebook https://www.facebook.com/jordanstratford  and Twitter https://twitter.com/#!/jordanstratford with regards to this project.\nOh yes, and we'll be kicking it forward.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #40", "update_userinfo": "Download Your Copy of Wollstonecraft Book 3 Now!", "update_content": "It's her birthday, so in honour of Mary's mum and the detective agency's namesake, I thought I'd give an update.\nIt's eight months to the release of Book One in stores worldwide, and in the meantime I'm working away on Book Three.

Needless to say not everyone is getting the updates!\nShort version is this: all fulfillment is being done via Knopf/RandomPenguin *BUT* they are coordinating things with the book one launch in January of 2015. A whole year. Which is apparently the pace of such things (painful, glacial, anxiety-inducing). Book Two is with the editors, I'm writing Book Three, the illustrations by Kelly Murphy are looking AMAZING but they haven't even finished the book one illos yet.

So the incredible Nancy Siscoe at Knopf in New York (a division of Random House) is working with me to get the manuscript gleaming and ready for release \u2013 not just on-demand paperbacks and ebooks, but also hardcovers available globally.
