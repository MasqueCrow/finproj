We design and make products. To preorder this Travel Tripod and bring it to life, click Back This Project. Or scroll on, scroller. \nTake a closer look at the Travel Tripod with Lawrence, Peak Design's boy genius:\nAnd, check out the host of optional accessories that you can add onto your pledge (instructions at end of video):\nSo why redesign the tripod? Because traditional travel tripods have a critical flaw: tons of wasted space. The result is a tool that is inherently difficult to carry with you into the field. We fixed that, and more. \nWe spent 4 years redesigning the tripod from the ground up to eliminate dead space and minimize packed-down size. \nBut we didn't stop at space savings. \nWe made a tool that deploys and packs down rapidly\u2014nearly twice as fast as a traditional tripod. We made it intuitive and delightful to use. We engineered professional-quality stability and performance. And we added thoughtful features to help you get the shot\u2014 with any gear, in any environment, from any point of view.  \nWe built the Travel Tripod around the photographer's workflow. How? We are photographers.\n\nWe loaned pre-production samples of the Travel Tripod to some of our favorite creatives on Youtube. Here's what they had to say:\nPeter McKinnon compares the PD Travel Tripod to the Gitzo Traveler:\nManny Ortiz goes ham on the Carbon Fiber Travel Tripod in downtown Chi-town:\nKitty Peters of Atola Visuals goes deep on the Travel Tripod and shares footage from our media unveiling event we hosted in San Francisco:\nTechCrunch interviews Peter Dering and Art Viger on the design considerations behind the Travel Tripod:\nAlright, let's dive deeper into every crevice of the Travel Tripod's functionality:\nPro performance. Half the size.\nThe Travel Tripod takes up half the volume of a traditional travel tripod. We also eliminated bulky, protruding knobs. The result? Every water bottle pocket on your bag is now also a tripod pocket, and you're carrying a full sized tripod with professional capabilities.\n\nSet it up (and pack it down) faster.\nWith traditional travel tripods, slow setup may mean a missed shot. Not with the Peak Design Travel Tripod. We designed strong, easy-to-use leg cam levers that can be operated together (no tedious twist locks!). With our architecture there's no need for the legs to flip up/down when packing and unpacking.  And, we topped it off with lightning-fast camera quick-attachment/release.\nCurrent office record: 9.4 seconds from packed to legs deployed.\n\nLove thy ball head.\nNo more guessing which knob to turn or how far to turn it: a single and precision-engineered adjustment ring gives total articulation. Our locking ring gives you further stability and vibration reduction. But even without it, your camera is locked securely in place. The unique head design gives you greater range of articulation, and incorporates 3 portrait mode cutouts instead of 1.\nMade for the camera in your bag.\nMake no mistake: the Travel Tripod is small, but it's ready for big jobs. High-performance materials and precision machined parts yield weight capacity, stability, and vibration dampening comparable to much larger, more expensive tripods. The Travel Tripod is designed to handle pro photography gear, easily handling a full-frame DSLR with a 70-200 lens. Combining a 20lb weight capacity with a 60\" max height, the Travel Tripod performs as well as any other in its class. \nAlso made for the camera in your pocket.\nThere's a reason that phones are already the most used cameras in the history of cameras: mobile devices take incredible pictures,  they're only getting better, and you always have it with you. That's why we gave the Travel Tripod a brilliant, stowable, universal mobile mount hidden in the center column.\nMore points of view. More environments. \nIt takes just seconds to switch to Inverted Mode, perfect for macro or product photography. Or, with a few turns of the included hex wrench, you can reconfigure into Low Mode. The Travel Tripod goes lower than any other tripod in its class, enabling unmatched ground perspective shots. Plus our separately available add-ons give even more versatility: the Universal Head Adaptor lets our tripod with any tripod head, our Spike Feet add grip in ice and looser terrain, and the Ultralight Conversion Kit removes the bottom 4 sections of each leg and takes almost half the weight off your tripod making it an incredible tabletop-sized backpacking tripod. Check out our addendum video for more info on the accessories. \nA zippered soft case from the legendary Peak Design soft goods department, plus all the tools to use and maintain your new tripod: our precision machined aluminum Standard Plate, a hex wrench for plate tightening and tripod maintenance, and the phone mount mentioned above.\nL-brackets and 3rd party tripod plates. Remove the pins on the ball head for longer plates. Compatible with most Arca Swiss plates. \nHow about the entire Peak Design Ecosystem. Secure Anchor connection points let you carry the Travel Tripod with any Peak Design strap. The Travel Tripod uses the same plate that comes with our Capture Camera Clip. Carry the Travel Tripod in (or on) any Peak Design bag. It's the size and shape of a water bottle, making it easy to carry in any bag you want.\n\n\nDurable, serviceable, and guaranteed for life.\nWeatherproof and impact-resistant, we built the Travel Tripod to give you years of joy. How many years? A lifetime. Like all Peak Design products, we guarantee the Travel Tripod for life (see warranty details in the FAQ). We made every part of the Travel Tripod serviceable, cleanable, and replaceable, to give it a longer lifespan and generate less waste.\nReady to take the plunge? Click Back This Project, and pick a reward.\nThen let's add on some accessories:\n\nPeep this sick vid for details on the above add-ons, and instructions on how to add them:\n\nAnd what if you're detail-oriented?\nTripod Specs, Materials & Performance Testing\nWe've been working with a Stanford physicist during pre-production to ensure the Peak Design Travel Tripod has pro-level stability. Well, he's not just any Stanford physicist. David Berryrieser is the founder of The Center Column, a site dedicated to scientifically testing tripods. David may be the world's foremost expert on tripod performance.\nIn short, the Peak Design Travel Tripod is as stable, if not more stable, than most other travel tripods in its class. That means you get extreme compactness without sacrificing performance.\nDavid tests tripods using harmonic oscillation. For more info on what that means and how the Peak Design Travel Tripod compares to others, read Update #8. Here's what the testing looks like:\nTesting of the PD Carbon Fiber Travel Tripod. Note how much less movement there is versus the otherwise comparable 3rd party travel tripod below.\nTesting of the MeFOTO Road Trip Carbon Fiber Travel Tripod.\nAgain, read Update #8 for the full story behind our performance testing.\n\nEnvironmental & Social Impact\nMaking and selling stuff creates pollution. It is Peak Design's responsibility to clean up that mess, and find ways to make less mess in the first place. It is also our responsibility to look out for the well-being of the many people who contribute to Peak Design, ensuring that we succeed at the expense of nobody.\nBelow are the key sustainability and responsibility considerations in making the Travel Tripod. You can learn about Peak Design's company-wide sustainability plan here.\nTravel Tripod is carbon neutral. That means that zero net greenhouse gases are emitted when making/delivering the Travel Tripod. We achieve this by measuring the Scope 1-3 carbon footprint of the Travel Tripod, from raw material mining to manufacturing to shipping to the end customer. We then reduce or offset that carbon footprint in its entirety. Peak Design is fully carbon neutral, all the way back to the beginning of our company.\nTravel Tripod is fully serviceable, and nearly every single part is individually replaceable. It also comes with a lifetime guarantee. This means less material has the chance to end up in a landfill.\nTravel Tripod is built in factories that pay workers fairly and provide for their safety. Peak Design works with our partner factories to maintain a code of conduct for worker pay, safety, and conditions. We invest in 3rd party audits to ensure these standards are always met. \n1% of Travel Tripod sales go to grassroots environmental nonprofits. Peak Design is a 1% for the Planet member, meaning that 1% of all our revenue goes to protecting wild places. As of April 2019, we've donated over $1 million to environmental nonprofits.\n\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe launch our products on Kickstarter because it gives us the freedom to run our business exactly how we want. The funds we generate on Kickstarter make it possible for us to continue developing products without seeking venture capital. That means we're not beholden to growth goals, revenue targets, or product timelines imposed by other people. Instead, we focus on doing what we love: building the best things we can possibly make, fueled by support from the best customers we could possibly ask for.\nThis is our 9th Kickstarter project since 2011. From the beginning, our backers have steered the direction of our product roadmap, both with their feedback, and with direct participation in our design process via surveys and focus groups. This close collaboration is made possible by communication and community-building tools of the Kickstarter platform.\nThank you for letting us continue on this incredible journey.\n\n  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 9th Kickstarter project since 2011. Through the years we've gotten pretty darn good at setting accurate expectations and delivering on our promises. But no matter how much we've got our poop in a group (official midwestern terminology) things can still go awry. If they do, we solemnly promise to give you full transparency into the issues and solve them in a way that leaves our backers happy and proud to support our company.\n\nSupply Chain Risk: Sometimes a machine or tool breaks. Sometimes a factory loses power for a day. Sometimes we get the wrong parts or materials in. These things happen from time to time and can affect how long it takes to build our products.\n\nShipping Risk: Global shipping and warehousing logistics is mind-boggling. Hence we outsource that stuff to experts. But even the experts aren't immune to weather, port congestion, and other uncontrollable factors.\n\nActs of God: We're based in San Francisco. That means we could have an earthquake. Or a horrific avocado toast shortage.

Simply squeeze and credit cards emerge, perfectly arrayed for immediate access.  Release your grip, and the cards drop down, locking in securely.\nThe wallet is beyond tough. We built and tested the wallet to last over 100 years.  The internal lift system is tested to well over 500,000 cycles (and going), the wallet is corrosion resistant and thoroughly impact-tested.  We construct it right here in Utah out of American aluminum, stainless steel, and high-strength polymer.  In other words, it will last you your lifetime, backed by our Industry leading \u201cA3 Guarandamntee.\u201d\nThe wallet comes optional with a high quality leather sleeve for those of us who are \u201cminimalist-plus,\u201d  allowing you to store cash or just more cards.  Without the leather jacket, the GRIP6 wallet feels strong, sleek, and space-age.  With the leather, the wallet feels more traditional, but maintains strength and quality.  We\u2019ve also included the optional FingerLoop\u2122 at no extra cost, which increases control, pocket access, and is fun to use. \nMade poorly and wear out quickly\nOften bulky, thick and annoying\nDifficult to access cards you need\nDon't protect against RFID\nThe defining feature of the GRIP6 Wallet is the patent pending internal lift mechanism. With a simple squeeze, 6 cards emerge in an easy to retrieve stair step pattern.  This geometry leaves enough room between the cards for you to locate and grab the individual card you need. The cards can be put back in any order.\nWe spent a great deal of time testing and redesigning the wallet to last hundreds of thousands of cycles, simulating a century of use and abuse.  We don't believe in planned obsolescence.  We wanted a wallet to last longer than you. That may sound far-fetched, but it's true. We built a machine to cycle test the wallet half a million times before we stopped it, but it still hadn't broken. We took the wallet apart to see what damage had occurred, but almost none had; the wear was minimal. We feel really good about our final design and we think you'll love it.  You will be able to use your GRIP6 Wallet more than a dozen times per day, everyday, and it should last 105 years.  Because we're confident in our abilities and testing, we've also guaranteed them for life.\nWhen you're not actively using the GRIP6 Wallet, the cards automatically remain locked in by a patent pending mechanism.  In addition, the light, durable 6061 T6 Aluminum body effectively blocks RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) signals used by the modern thief.  These features make sure the GRIP6 Wallet is both physically and electronically secure, and give you needed peace of mind.\nWe have a deep-seated belief that manufacturing is critical to the future of the United States' economy.  Many \"Made in the USA\" products are from materials and components from outside of the USA.  With the GRIP6 Wallet, we are able to source the high quality Aluminum, the top-grain Leather, and the glass bead-blasted injection molded plastic for the lever and internal lift mechanism all within the  USA.  The only thing we don't source within the USA are the stainless steel screws.  We're looking at bringing that home soon.\nAnd it's not just made and sourced in the USA.  We cut and build the wallets right here in Utah, at our in-house manufacturing facility.  Owning the production process of a product also allows us to: \nTightly control quality and consistency\nMake minute process and redesign changes immediately\nIncorporate customer feedback quickly\nProvide fulfilling local jobs\nProblem solve any issues that arise very quickly\nWe only use the best materials. The GRIP6 Wallet is wrought from 6061 T6 anodized aluminum, stainless steel screws, stainless steel springs, stainless steel pins and a high performance, glass bead-blasted, Bayblend\u00ae injection molded plastic. This wallet will withstand the toughest conditions and won't rust.\nThe FingerLoop\u2122 was created to enhance your interaction with your wallet. The unique loop design makes it a cinch to pull the wallet out of your pocket. It ensures a more secure hold on the wallet and, most importantly, it's really fun!  You can flip your GRIP6 Wallet in your hand like a wild west gunslinger all day long and people around you will wonder, \"What is that thing!? It's amazing! I want one!\" But in all honestly, it really is both functional and fun.  We do caution you is that it's likely to annoy people how much you take your wallet out of your pocket to sling it around!\n The optional Leather Jacket gives your GRIP6 Wallet a softer, more traditional feel and provides expandability. It can hold both cards and cash and doubles the capacity of your wallet. The prototype leather covers are laser cut, but during full production they will be cut with a die on a clicker press (i.e., the leather will be clean and consistent).  They are then sewn on our \"Boss\" leather sewing machine that is capable of punching through 3/4\" thick layers of leather or webbing. We will be converting the hand stitching machine into a fast, automated sewing machine for volume production.\nThe funds raised from this kickstarter will be used to purchase domestic plastic injection molds, all raw materials, equipment for cutting and sewing leather, and custom tooling for CNC machining the plates. We will literally be creating these unbelievable wallets with our own hands.  We've already done the hard work and know we'll be delivering you a one-of-a-kind product. We're excited to share the journey with you!\nBJ Minson was a regular, back-pocket-wallet kind of guy for many years. But one day in a fit of minimalist indignation he pulled his sloppy, misshapen, hideous wallet out of his back pocket and asked himself, \"Why in the world do I sit on this stupid thing all day?\" \nSo, he decided to put his cards in his front pocket and used a blue rubber band taken from a broccoli stem to hold them together. It was sooooo much better... for two weeks. Then the rubber brand broke. He bought more broccoli and a new rubber band, and the rubber band broke again.  This cycle happened several times. It wasn\u2019t a bad setup: BJ was getting healthier eating all the broccoli and at least he didn\u2019t have to deal with the ills of a regular wallet.  But it wasn\u2019t perfect. \nNext, he purchased a thin, simple, card-holding wallet. It was good, but it was difficult to find the right card and even more difficult to get the card out, and the wallet fell apart too quickly. He bought a different one.  Rinse and repeat, the same thing happened. \nAt the time BJ was studying mechanical engineering and he determined to design a better wallet. He got together with his friend Dan and over the course of several months developed the GRIP6 Wallet. \nAt the time, BJ knew very little about manufacturing and the wallet was going to be fairly expensive to produce. He decided to give it a try on Kickstarter in 2012 with an audacious goal of $100,000.  Even with a sale price of more than $100, the wallet did surprisingly well and got almost halfway to the goal! But, sadly, ultimately did not fund. \nBJ went on to finish school, get a day job as an engineer, and kept his prototype wallet in his pocket for the next 7 years (yes, the original wallet still works fine). During that time, he designed and produced a new belt that was innovative, simple, and amazing. He launched it on Kickstarter in 2014 and it funded! BJ founded a company called GRIP6 (check out grip6.com for more info). He started in his garage with the help of friends and since that time has made hundreds of thousands of belts. \nGRIP6 grew quickly and steadily and has become a company that prioritizes and understands the value and complexity of in-house production and manufacturing efficiency.  Even as GRIP6 grew to be a leader in belts, BJ\u2019s mind often wandered back to his beloved wallet, and he finally decided to bring his wallet to life. \nHe and his team of engineers at GRIP6 have spent thousands of hours, exhausting their experience and ingenuity to make the wallet better, stronger, and much more economical. In honor of the birthplace of the original wallet and the GRIP6 name, BJ decided to bring it back to Kickstarter to give it new birth and to give the Kickstarter community the first opportunity to join the project and share the journey of bringing the wallet to full production.  \nSo - Thank you kickstarter community for giving us a start we couldn't have found anywhere else! We'll always be grateful to you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are no strangers to manufacturing and the difficulties and problems that arise.

We spent over a year sourcing 100% pesticide-free, heirloom cardamom that met our high standards of taste, quality and sustainability, and we\u2019re finally ready to share it with you!\n$25,000 allows us to purchase the entire 400 lb 2019 spring harvest, and package it in our beautifully redesigned recycled glass jars.\n Anything we make over $25k, will go towards purchasing milling equipment, sourcing Coorgi rainforest pepper, Gujarati sea salt, Rajasthani desert cumin and regional chill peppers from Karnataka and Andhra, coming end 2019!  \nThis cardamom has been a long time coming...\nI first tried to source organically farmed Indian green cardamom in the spring of 2018. I called all my contacts at the Indian Institute of Spice Research and the Indian Cardamom Research Institute (ICRI), and put the word out amongst my network of South Indian farmers and their communities. \nBy summer 2018, I collected samples from several certified organic cardamom growers, but heard a very concerning story from the spice research community. Dr. Vijayan, a trusted resource and the deputy director of research at ICRI, bluntly explained to me how big commercial cardamom growers cheat the organic certification process to sell pesticide-ridden cardamom labeled as organic to the global market. Sure enough, every single lab result for the samples I received came back positive for pesticides.\nJust when I had given up on sourcing pesticide-free cardamom, I got a call from Mr. Abraham Chacko- a farmer bang the middle of the cardamom hills- the region where commercial and corrupt cardamom agriculture is at its worst. Shockingly, his sample came back 100% pesticide free. I booked a flight to visit him the next day. \nAbraham started farming over 20 years ago on his family estate with little success. In 2017, after adopting a new low-budget biodynamic farming method, he noticed some of his cardamom plants were faring much better than the rest. He began to selectively breed the older, hardier plants bearing healthy fruit and withstanding the pests that usually devastate organic cardamom. \nThe resulting cardamom seeds are fruity, incredibly potent, with a lasting fragrance. I could already imagine the kadak, spicy cups of chai, or the aromatic, heady pastries we could make with them! \nFrom left: The Princess (50g) and The Queen (100g)\nAbraham has tried to sell his cardamom at the local auction house for years, but commodity cardamom is chosen based on size and color alone, factors that have no relation to their taste or quality. His paler, smaller pods fetch a low price, and since the auction houses are usually financed in some part by pesticide and fertilizer companies, there is no market for anything grown organically.\nThe commodity price of cardamom is 15x the price of every other spice on the Indian spice market. After saffron and vanilla, it's the third most expensive spice in the country. So naturally, it is a game of big players with big cash, and whilst we're a small player with small cash we've always had big dreams, big impact, and big community :) \n WHO WE ARE: \nDiaspora Co. was founded in August 2017 to disrupt and decolonize the spice supply chain. Our first offering, a high-curcumin, freshly-milled, heirloom turmeric called Pragati, was born out of the idea that if turmeric was going to explode and have its \"moment\" in the U.S., we wanted to make sure that it was sourced equitably, transparently and sustainably. We've since become known as the highest standard of turmeric in the U.S., used in your favorite turmeric latte brands, restaurant menus and in over 15k homes across the country. \nOur business promise is to pay our partner farms between 2x-10x the commodity price (more on that below), and source the freshest, heirloom, single-origin spices from India.

Even worse, if you don\u2019t have a good grip on your items, they can ALL fall back into the sink \u2013 taking your sanity with them.\nThe Equilibric colander reduces the amount of water needed to wash your fruits and vegetables by 60% - all while removing twice as many contaminants! You will never have to worry about items in the sink again because this design saves you time and frustration.\nIts ergonomic design keeps the vegetables upright and safe as the water bowl drains the dirty water away, cleaning your foods and keeping your clean items safe from spillage.\n\nThe colander also serves as a great serving dish for you.  You don\u2019t have to worry about using more dishes than necessary just because you need something to put them in afterwards.  Drain the excess water from your vegetables - and serve your fruits or salads in the same dish.\nTrying to defrost something at room temperature turns into a huge problem for most cooks.  Water often winds up all over the counter creating an even bigger mess, and more work for you.\nWith typical colanders, lots of dirt and other contaminates can transfer to your clean serving dishes.  But with the Equilibric colander, its washing machine motion helps remove 90% of the dirt and bacteria from your foods \u2013 giving you a healthier, more nutrient rich meal!\nAs you can see, the Equilibric colander saves you time and energy.  It\u2019s also incredibly efficient, sanitary, and environmentally conscious.  Moreover it saves extra money on your water bill.\nEquilibric has a very well considered hole slots pattern that allows to drain the excess water fast and simple. Equilibric Bowl is made from a high quality polypropylene which is an unharmful material to dine from. Equilibric Bowl design has a special spin system which uses the force of gravity to speed up all kitchen tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\nStory. Team. Development. Future.\nMy name is Ann and I\u2019ve been working in design for eight years. I\u2019ve graduated twice and worked my way from the position of a common designer to art director. My husband Tim is an engineer and likes inventing. Together we\u2019ve come up with Equilibric.\nMe and Tim were born in the countryside, and despite growing up in an urban area, we always preferred home food over fast food l, which bears no benefit or proper nutrients, often being harmful. So we cook home a lot and try to ease doing so process as much as possible.\nFour years ago I had the idea to improve the typical colander design, after having bought all kinds of them in stores, inspired by design of various items and inventions, from spoons to airplanes. So I took a pencil and got to draw.\n\nThanks to Tim, my sketches and concepts came to life as working prototypes.\n\n\nThe most problematic part was talking to various China-based factories. We were sending the design and info over, but struggled with communication problems. But ultimately, we found a manufacturer and a manager that helped us on this stage after it had stretched on for a while.\nTwo years ago, Sabina joined us as a co-founder, responsible for communications and marketing. Without her, we wouldn\u2019t have been able to make it to Kickstarter and organize everything.\nWe\u2019re really grateful to Inpixel, the company that took care of the video material for us, delivering calmly great results despite my quite extensive list of requests.\nOur future plans is to introduce a brand new type of colander for enthusiasts and kitchen professionals. I promise, you haven\u2019t seen anything like it before, and we\u2019ll be showcasing it on Kickstarter right from the concept stage! We\u2019re also creating a USB-powered heating food container, which might possible have its own battery.\nOur global goal is to create a brand of smart kitchen gadgets and food containers (both with and without heating) for carrying your dishes.\nPlease help us bring our plans to life, and become part of Equilibric!\n\nTIMELINE\n\nApril 24, Project ends\nMay 8, Receiving funds from Kickstarter\nMay 9 - July 10, Mass production\nJuly 10-20, Quality control\nJuly 20-25, Shipping to the fulfilment and logistics centre\nJuly 26, Shipping out\nEnd of August, All backers receive their Equilibric\n\nSHIPPING INFORMATION \n\n+ SHIPPING ADDRESSES WILL BE COLLECTED VIA CROWDOX  \nhttps://crowdox.com\n\n+ LOGISTICS AND FULLFILMENT SERVICES WILL BE PROVIDED BY SFC \nhttps://www.sendfromchina.com\nSHIPPING RATES\n1 piece (Round or Square)\nUnited States - $5\nCanada - $5\nHong Kong - $5\nSingapore - $5\nChina - $5\nKorea - $5\nJapan - $8\nEurope - $8\nUnited Kingdom -$8\nAustralia - $12\nRussian Federation - $12\nRest of the world - $12\n2 piece (Round or Square)\nUnited States - $9\nCanada - $10\nHong Kong - $10\nSingapore - $10\nChina - $10\nKorea - $10\nJapan - $16\nEurope - $16\nUnited Kingdom -$16\nAustralia - $25\nRussian Federation - $25\nRest of the world - $25\n 6 piece (Round or Square)\nUnited States - $20\nCanada - $25\nHong Kong - $25\nSingapore - $25\nChina - $25\nKorea - $25\nJapan - $29\nEurope - $29\nUnited Kingdom -$29\nAustralia - $45\nRussian Federation - $45\nRest of the world - $45\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 650+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $300MM raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSomething can always go wrong especially when we are talking about worldwide shipping.

This time around, we wanted to design a more minimal pen that's sleek and pocket friendly. By incorporating the highest quality materials with subtle design elements, we were able to create a full size feel in a compact form factor. Whether you're in the board room or out in the field, the EP1 is the essential EDC pen for any occasion.\nWe designed the REFYNE EP1 around the Schmidt easyFLOW 9000 refill because we love the way it writes. Smooth and easy. Also, we knew that by choosing this style refill, it would allow users to swap out to literally dozens of other options because our pen works with any standard parker style refills (list of refills below). Who doesn\u2019t like variety, right?\nFeaturing a unique shaped bolt action channel, the bolt action mechanism was chosen for its simplicity and ease of deployment. With the flick of your finger you can open or close the pen in a fraction of a second. We decided to add a subtle design element, by using copper for the internal barrel. \nDepending on your carry preferences, the sleek deep carry pocket clip can be easily removed with the turn of a screw. The integrated top cap allows this to be done seamlessly without showing any unsightly holes or notches when the clip is taken off. Additionally, the clip is keyed to keep it secure and in position. \nEach screw has been custom machined and accepts a standard Torx T6 bit. This makes tightening down the bolt or removing the pocket clip both effortless and secure.\nDimensions: 115mm x 10mm (4.53\" x 0.39\")\nPolished Titanium body: 24g (0.88oz)\nBlack PVD Coated Stainless Steel body: 36g (1.23oz)\nRemovable Custom deep carry pocket clip\nCopper Barrel Bolt-Action\nBlack Schmidt easyFLOW 9000 M refill (included)\nCompatible with most Parker style refills\nCustom Torx T6 hardware\nList of most Parker Style Refills:\nFaber-Castell Ballpoint Pen Refill\nFaber-Castell Scribero Gel Ink Roller Refill\nFisher Space Pen Refill, PR Series- Colors (Bold, Medium, Fine)\nFisher Space Pen \u2013 Universal Ballpoint Refill\nForay (Office Depot) Ballpoint Refill for Parker (Medium)\nItoya Aquaroller Refill (0.7 and 1.0mm)\nKaweco Soul G2 Refill 1.0mm\nKaweco Sport Roller Ball Pen Refill\nMoleskine Ballpoint Refill\nMoleskine Gel Refill (0.5 and 0.7 mm)\nMoleskine Roller Gel Fluorescent Refills\nMonteverde Ceramic Gel Refill (Broad)\nMonteverde Needle Point Refill (Fine)\nMonteverde Soft Roll- Colored inks (Medium)\nMonteverde Soft Roll- (Superbroad, Medium, Ultrafine)\nOHTO Needlepoint Ballpoint Pen Refill PS-807NP\nOHTO PS-205NP Extra-Fine 0.5mm Ballpoint Pen Refill\nParafernalia Ballpoint Pen Refill NO LOGO\nParker Ballpoint Pen Refill (Broad, Medium, Fine)\nParker GEL Ballpoint Pen Refill (Medium)\nParker Quinkflow Ballpoint Pen Refill (Medium, Fine)\nPelikan Giant Ballpoint Pen Refill 337 (Broad, Fine, Medium)\nPentel KFLT8 Ballpoint Pen Refill\nPlatignum Standard Ballpoint Pen Refill\nPremec Parker-Style G2 Gel Refill (0.4, 0.5 and 0.7 mm)\nRetro 51 Tornado Roller Ball Refills (REF5P) (Made by Schmidt)\nSchmidt 9000M EasyFlow Pen Refill\nSchmidt P8126 Capless Rollerball (Fine)\nSchmidt P8900 Super Bowl Refill (Fine)\nSchmidt P900 B Ballpoint Pen Refill (Broad, Medium, Fine)\nSchmidt P950M Megaline Pressurized Ballpoint Pen Refill (Medium)\nSchneider Express 735 Pen Refill (Broad, Medium, Fine)\nSchneider Slider 755 Pen Refill (Extra-Broad, Medium)\nSTABILO EASYgel Refill\nStabilo Ballpoint Refill\nTombow BR-ZLM Ballpoint Pen Refill\nVisconti Ballpoint Pen Refill AA49 1.4 (Broad)\nVisconti Gel Refill (Broad, Medium, Fine)\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 650+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $300MM raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs experienced and successful project creators across three brands, we're fully aware of all the different risks and challenges that could arise when bringing a product into reality.

With the use of basic tools, a simple design emerged from my hands.  A small and tactile object that has proven to be more useful in everyday life than I had expected. Along with many of the original adopters, I still use this little cutting tool on a daily basis. It really has withstood the test of time.\nClear and Cloudy\nRainbow and Midnight\nThe shape and name of the Tidashi is derived from a traditional Japanese utility knife, called Kiridashi-Kogatana; a design recognized by its long handle and short cutting edge. In Japan this tool is still relied upon for making accurate cuts or markings on wood. \nEDC\nReiteration\nOver the years, Tidashi users have provided me with feedback. A slight size increase has often been suggested, and I am glad to say that that is exactly what the Tidashi 2.0 is offering, resulting in a more confident grip when using the tool. \nEvolution\nA redesigned and more substantial silicone sheath provides just the right amount of friction for securely holding and releasing the Tidashi. It also allows for the use of larger diameter paracord and keyrings, both of which are included. It is still made from the same long lasting silicone material which has held my personal original Tidashi for all these years.\nDimensions\nTrue to its origins, the Tidashi 2.0 is cut from grade 5 titanium, known for its toughness and corrosion resistance. It is often used in diving knives, as it is lighter than steel and able to resist even the harsh environment of salt water. The fact that this particular alloy lends itself to easy sharpening is something that I have found useful, but not essential to the Tidashi design. It is not a tool for slicing tomatoes. The blade length is simply too short for that. Its forte lies in puncturing and shallow cuts, as done when opening packages. And of course its biggest strength, as with any tool, is the fact that its size allows you to have it on you when you need it. \nAlways with you\nEmergence\nIn order to increase the manufacturing accuracy and consistency of this new iteration of the Tidashi, I have decided to have its basic shape cut by CNC. This will allow me to focus more on the final finish of the Tidashi, including a unique anodizing method for bringing out the amazing colors of the natural titanium oxide layer that covers any titanium object.\nColors...\nThe decision to relinquish absolute control over the original Tidashi design by walking away from my computer, is also what guided me in developing a new coloring method for the Tidashi 2.0. I tried to put emphasis on naturally occurring patterns. By subtly controlling the flow of acid and electricity along the surface of the Tidashi, I was able to bring out some unique shapes and colors reminiscent of the cloudy skies over my home in the Sierra Nevada mountains. Although the process is repeatable, no two knives with this pattern will be exactly the same, just like the skies.  I was also able to recreate the original color combinations such as Rainbow and Midnight for a total of ten unique versions for you to choose from. I am showing all ten variations here, but please scroll all the way down for some more info about the new storage pouch.\n1.Natural\n2.Clouds\n3.Midnight\n4.Acid\n5.Rainbow Black\n6.Rainbow White\n7.Sky\n8.Black Gold\n9.White Gold\n10.Purple Rain\nPackaging\nIn the past I have often spent a lot of time and energy on the packaging of my designs. And although a custom box for your Tidashi would be nice, I was recently confronted with the sheer amount of waste I was producing by doing this. In response I have decided to package the Tidashi 2.0 in a more permanent and reusable zippered Cordura pouch. It is lined in a soft plush material to protect your Tidashi not only during shipping, but also if you should choose to store it. The design in not finalized yet, but it will most likely be just like in the picture below.\nStorage pouch included\nExperience\nAfter having fulfilled several campaigns and having shipped thousands of rewards, I would consider myself a veteran Kickstarter creator. I very much consider the Kickstarter experience a shared one between myself and the backers, which is why I am always very open about the project in regular updates. I also try to answer any and all questions asked in messages and in the comment section. My backers and I have traveled this path from inception to completion several times, and we have seen the highs and lows along the route. The previous project has been especially hard, and it has shown me which pitfalls to avoid in future endeavors, including the project we are embarking on now. I hope you will join us, and make the Tidashi 2.0 project another successful one. \nCheers,\nSander", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf there is one thing I have learned from my previous project, it is how the complexity of a design can exponentially increase the risk of something going wrong during production. It is the main reason why I chose to keep this design as simple as the original design. It is also why I chose to keep the anodizing process in house. It is a process too delicate to hand off. \n\nThe process of manufacturing the basic shape of the Tidashi 2.0 is done by an overseas manufacturer I have worked with in the past. They have been reliable and based on the samples they provided (which are in the pictures you see here) I believe they will provide an excellent product. As the project is going live we are discussing some final details about the cutting process and final finish of the shape. I plan to perform a thorough quality control on the initial small production runs, before increasing the production volume. And if for whatever reason the manufacturer cannot continue production, I can always fall back on the equipment I acquired for making the original Tidashi, and move production in house. \n\nThe mold used for creating the silicone sheath has already been made and paid for, because I wanted to show you the result in the pictures. This means that production of the sheaths should not be the bottle neck in this project.\n\nThe pouch design is based on an existing design, and the manufacturer has indicated that it is comfortable making it. If problems should arise with the manufacturing, I would not have a problem reverting to the exact design that the manufacturer already makes on a regular basis (the only difference is a slightly different size). \n\nI will be shipping the Tidashis anywhere in the world from the US, and although the declared value of the average shipment will be below the duty threshold of most countries, there is a chance that you will have to pay some import duties, especially on larger shipments. If you have ever ordered anything from abroad, you are probably already aware of this, and know that I have no control over this, other than keeping the declared value to a minimum.\n \nAlthough the cutting edge of the Tidashi is very short, I want every backer to be aware that there is always the possibility that the laws of your country do not allow you to carry it in public. As far as I am aware, it has never happened in the past. \n\nIn summary, I believe that the biggest risk would be delay in the expected delivery date. The reason for this is that definitive information about production quantities will not be available until after the campaign closes. This is a problem that is almost inherent to the Kickstarter system, and we'll work with it.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 26 or more", "title": "One (1) Tidashi 2.0", "descp": "This amazing deal gets you one Tidashi 2.0 in NATURAL color.

The Magnet Driver\u2122 Mini grips and holds screws in place, making fastening much easier in all aspects. You don\u2019t even need a second hand involved.\nThere are five total Magnet Driver\u2122 Minis \u2014 in two different colors signifying different sizes \u2014 that work with our 1-\u215b\u201d precision bits or standard 1-\u00be\u201d precision bits.\nThe Magnet Driver\u2122 Full Set reward comes with 20 extra-long S2 Steel bits in eight different types, and bits are color coded to match with the appropriate Magnet Driver\u2122 Mini size.\nThis magnetic mat keeps your metal objects perfectly organized. Place small pieces and screws directly on the mat for guaranteed safety and security. Not to mention, it details the Moon and the place and date of the first man landing on the moon.\nThe Magnet Driver\u2122 Carrying Case keeps everything safe and secure for easy portability.\n                       Michael Perez, the inventor of Magnet Driver\u2122 Space Rocket, has had a lifelong overarching passion for technology and has always been fond of the milestones it has reached over time. Coupled with his passion for technology, developing a precision screwdriver in honor of Apollo 11 was always a lifelong goal he strived to achieve. He spent a lot of time seeking a way to combine his passions into one product. From this, he developed the idea of the Magnet Driver\u2122 Space Rocket, which perfectly merges a toolkit with space rocket and moon accents. The rest was history. For him, everything has to be related to this commemoration, as it is crucial to humanity. For this campaign, we\u2019d like to give special thanks to our friend, Rafael M\u00e9ndez Pe\u00f1a, who not only collaborated with NASA to produce documentaries and outreach videos, but also helped us with our video. He really knows how to rock it!\n  We can\u2019t thank you enough for checking out our project and helping us make Magnet Driver\u2122 Space Rocket a reality.\nWe know not everyone will be able to support us with a pledge, so even if you can\u2019t give a dollar or purchase a Magnet Driver\u2122 Space Rocket, if you\u2019re a supporter of Magnet Driver\u2122 Space Rocket, you can help us spread the word on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Instagram and anywhere else you can think of!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always certain risks that can arise at any moment during a project like this.

We listened to your feedback from the original Braza Bro Kickstarter and incorporated the improvements into this blade. Technically this is a Wharncliffe style blade, but it reminds us of a mini pocket cleaver.\nStart your morning off right!\nWe didn\u2019t set out to make the best mini pocket/keychain knife ever, it just happened. Mike at Bastion has been designing and making EDC blades and tools for a while, and he really knows what he\u2019s doing. That\u2019s why when I was dissatisfied with all other mini knives, he was the first person I turned to when looking to develop the perfect mini folding EDC knife... the Braza Bro. \nMike on the right with the original Braza EDC knive, and Daniel on left with Braza Bro EDC mini knife launched on Kickstarter earlier this year. I swear that we are holding them the same distance from the camera, the size difference creates an optical illusion.\nBraza Bro was a hit on Kickstarter earlier this year! Read more about the Braza Bro story here.\nNow the duo have returned with an all new iteration of the Braza Bro. You may recognize the comfortable handle design, but that's where the similarities end. The blade is a completely new design, available in two different steels, stainless or titanium handle options, and other features that were highly requested by our backers.\nStylish & Versatile Wharncliffe Blade\nLooking like the mad child of a bone busting clever and a hair popping razor blade, the  Wharncliffe style blade offers good looks with mad functionality. It's almost straight edge makes it good for carving and slicing. The pointed tip is like having a pocket exacto.\nErgonomic Handle Grip\nThe handle provides an excellent grip fitting in your first 3 fingers. The shape and contour of the handle will ensure that your hand won\u2019t slip.\nThere\u2019s a choil for the index finger, and a slight recess on the spine of the handle for the thumb to sit on. The blade spine is jimped to provide a non-slip grip for your finger. When in use, the Braza Bro feels much larger than it appears.\nNot only is it extremely comfortable to hold and use, it\u2019s also a beautiful knife to behold.\nComfortable to use.\nNEW!!! Multiple Blade Metal Options\n S35VN Stainless Steel is the newest, coolest, most high tech, and toughest stainless steel alloy available. It's what everyone dreams of in an EDC pocket blade these days. It's harder than squirrel tits and keeps an edge better than a line of coke. No, but for real though, this is some tough shit. Made in the USA by Crucible, it starts off as a metal powder which allows better control over composition than the traditional mixing of molten metals. It's then sintered to bond the powders together into solid stainless steel.\n D2 Tool Steel is used in popular high-quality EDC tools. D2 is a high carbon and high chromium air hardening steel. Yes, that means it's harder than frozen t-rex shit, which then fossilized and froze again. The benefits that are offered from D2 steel are excellent wear and abrasion resistance which is provided from its large volumes of carbides in the microstructure. D2 is used in long production cold work applications requiring very high wear resistance and a high compression strength. D2 is harder than S35VN, but is susceptible to surface corrosion.\nWhich Steel Do I Want?\nIf you want a no maintenance blade that will never rust, then choose S35VN.\nIf you want the hardest and sharpest longester (yes, that's a new scrabble word, try it), then choose D2 steel. If you're afraid of a blade that may get a little bit of rust and forms a patina over time, then don't choose D2 steel. D2 is not for cry babies or those with weak hearts. It will cut you, and it will rust a little. The upside is that you'll never have to sharpen it. Ok, you will have to sharpen it if you cut rocks and fossilized shit with it, but you won't have to sharpen it as often as S35VN.\nNEW!!! Titanium Handle Option\nAn ultralight titanium handle is paired with the S35VN blade. The weight difference is surprising when you hold it in your hand compared with the stainless handle.\nNEW!!! Deep Carry Pocket Clip\nDeep carry pocket clip was a highly requested feature change from the OG Braza Bro. Whether it makes you feel more discreet, or it gives you some good vibes that its more securely clipped onto your pocket, the deep carry clip looks bad ass, and is a feature rarely seen in knives this small.\nNEW!!! Reversible Pocket Clip\nLefty's rejoice! The Braza Bro Cleaver now features a reversible pocket clip. The pocket clip can be put on the left or right handle scale, whatever you like best. There's even a tiny insert with torx screw that covers the hole on the unused side.\nUse the deep carry on this side...\n... or that side\n Cutting Edge Length: 2.12\u201d (53.9mm)  \n Closed Length: 2.75\u201d (70mm)  \n Open Length: 4.77\" (121.3mm)  \n Total Weight: 1.34oz and 1.48 oz  \n Handle Material: Titanium or Stainless Steel  \n Cutting Steel: S35VN or D2 Tool Steel - heat treated for optimal edge hardness, strength and durability, stonewashed finish before grinding  \n Spine Jimping: Spine is jimped for non-slip finger hold  \n Bearing: Ceramic Ball Bearing - buttery smooth opening with no play.\n Hardware: Torx Stainless steel  \n Frame-lock: Adds security and strength  \n Pocket Clip: Stainless Steel and removable if not needed.\nKeychain and Lanyard Hole\n Manual and Safe Operation: No spring, no assist, not automatic.  \nSpine Jimping\nJimping refers to the series of notches on the spine of the blade near the handle. These notches provide increased grip for your finger to improve safety and cutting precision. \nFlipper \nThe flipper allows for lightning quick, 1 handed deployment. A ball detent holds the blade securely closed, but a quick flick of your finger sends it flying out. Once open, the flipper acts as a finger guard.\nThe flipper is completely manual in operation. There is no spring and no assist, so the Braza Bro is not automatic. It follows the same manual opening and closing principals as a regular folding, locking knife. \nCeramic Ball Bearings\nCeramic Ball Bearings make the opening action super smooth and have zero play so the blade won\u2019t wobble when cutting. These bearings are more expensive than the commonly used phosphor bronze bushings, but they are totally worth it. You'll be blown away every time you experience how fast the Braza Bro blade flips out, and then feels as solid as a non-folding, fixed blade knife when cutting.  \nLook at those tiny ball bearings!\nLook Ma, No Play!\nCeramic Balls are suitable for applications where high loads, high speeds and extreme temperatures are factors. Long life and the need for minimal lubrication make this material appropriate for extreme applications. Ceramic is non-porous, non-magnetic, noncorrosive and lighter than steel. In ball form, ceramic balls are also harder than steel and because ceramic balls are non-porous they are virtually frictionless and capable of spinning faster than steel balls. \nUltra-Strong Frame Lock\nThe frame lock is an integral part of this the Braza Bro EDC knife. The lock is CNC machined from the frame. It\u2019s secure and easy to release using only one hand.\nOne-Handed Opening and Closing\nThe flipper and ceramic ball bearings allow for lightning fast, one-handed opening. The frame lock makes it easy to close one-handed also. The flipper serves double duty and protects your finger when closing.\nManual and Safe Operation\nThe opening and closing of the Braza Bro Cleaver are completely manual in operation. There is NO spring and NO assist, so it is NOT automatic. It is the same as a regular folding, locking pocket knife. It will only open with as much force as you can put on the flipper with your finger, so there's no danger of it swinging out unexpectedly. \nThe cutting edge length is 2.12\u201d (53.9mm), much smaller than normal blade length restrictions (the carry restrictions are usually about 2.5\" max length).\nA ball detent keeps it closed. Since there is NO spring, the cutting edge can't accidentally spring open in your pocket or on your keychain. \nIt is up to you to check that local laws allow you to own or carry this tool.\nStainless Torx\u00ae Fasteners  \nTorx\u00ae screws and fasteners are recognized by the six-point star design on the head. Created in 1967 these exceptionally secure high-quality fasteners can be found on a wide range of motorcycles, automobiles, and computer systems. Torx\u00ae products are known for their ability to prevent screw damage\u2014and enable someone to produce a high amount of torque without causing harm to the product.\nErgonomic Contoured Grip  \nSmall knives can be hard to hold onto, but this is not the case with Braza Bro. The contoured handle provides an excellent grip and fits perfectly in your first 3 fingers when holding it. The flipper acts as a finger guard, preventing your hand from sliding forward onto the cutting edge.\nReversible Deep Carry Pocket Clip\nThe pocket clip is an essential feature that is often left out of mini pocket knives. Braza Bro allows you to choose between pocket clip, keychain, or lanyard carry. The pocket clip is made of stainless steel and coated the same color as the handle. The pocket clip is very secure. If the pocket clip is not needed, it is removable by using a Torx driver to remove the screw. \nUse the deep carry on this side...\n... or that side\nKeychain and Lanyard Hole  \nThe Braza Bro is the perfect EDC tool to keep on your keychain. The keychain and lanyard hole is more than a drilled hole afterthought as seen on other mini keychain knives. It is purposefully designed into the shape of the handle.\nOpen a can of whoopass!\nWho cut the cheese? Again?\nPop a Cap!\nScrew it!\nSlice it!\nWhat's inside the box?!?\nBraza Bro Cleaver is the non-identical twin of the Braza Bro. It shares some of the same EDC genetics as the Braza Bro, but comes with a different blade style and many improvements.\nThe process of creating the Braza Bro was more than just shrinking the original Braza. We had to go back to CAD and layout the new smaller design. Everything was miniaturized, from the tiny ceramic ball bearings that make it open so smooth and keep it wiggle free, to the smaller pins, screws and pocket clip. \nWe took all the backer input from the first Braza Bro and added a new blade style to create the Braza Bro Cleaver\nYou will be able to select the blacked out option when you fill out the shipping survey through BackerKit after the Kickstarter ends.\nShare the Braza Bro Cleaver and Earn Cash!\nWe're looking for assistance to spread the word about this campaign!

No one knows the exact nature of those who built the Dome, but the founders of this advanced civilization have come to be called the Forefathers.\nClick to download ultra hi-res\nYou will discover miraculous technologies and weird artifacts in the labyrinths of the Dome, but that is not all the Forefathers left behind. Watch out for automated security systems, traps, and inexplicable anomalies.\nIn addition, the Dome itself is showing signs of consciousness. It has been reacting to the human presence since the first explorers entered its domain. Once inside, no one is able to leave. Uncovering the wonders and dangers of the Dome is a one-way road.\nExploration and exploitation of the Dome is carried out by the CRONUS Foundation, a massive organization founded by the world\u2019s most powerful governments.\nNarrative\nLearn more about the narrative of Encased - in KS-update #14\nWhat the press says\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe want Encased to be just the way you see the perfect CRPG: a huge game, rich in content, sort of \u201cthe Fallout of our dreams\u201d, which all of us could be proud of. \nWe are developing the game for a while already. We have reached pre-alpha and we are confident that Encased could become a great game. But we are a small team, and there is a lot of things that we\u2019d like to add. With your help, Encased could become a way more ambitious, better fleshed out and polished project!\nBut it\u2019s not just about the money that could help us expand the game! One of our ground rules is to create games arm-in-arm with our community.\nA little bit about where the money will go\nKickstarter and taxes will take away about 10% of the funds. Part of what\u2019s left will be spent on actual implementation and shipping of all the wonderful rewards we\u2019ve come up with. All the rest we will spend on polishing, expanding, and improving the game. That includes a possibly bigger team - one more artist and several designers and scripters - which will spruce up the graphics and increase the number and quality of fights and story interactions. Also, the money will go towards voicework and localization which will make the game more fun and accessible for everyone.\nSocial Goals\nLearn more about social goals in KS-Update #11!\nFacebook likes: Like the Encased Facebook page and encourage your friends to do the same!\nFacebook shares: share the Encased announcement post on Facebook.\nTwitter followers: follow @darkcrystal_hq on Twitter and encourage your friends to too.\nTwitter retweets: retweet the announcement tweet from @darkcrystal_hq\nTwitter likes: Like the announcement tweet from @darkcrystal_hq\nDiscord fans: join our Discord group.\nThe Story\nAs a new recruit, the player must choose one of five Wings:\nBlack Wing - military and security forces;\nWhite Wing - scientists, medics and researchers;\nBlue Wing - engineers and technicians;\nSilver Wing - upper management;\nOrange Wing - ex-convicts who have exchanged their prison jumpsuits for the uniform of a CRONUS laborer.\nThough your selected Wing grants certain starting bonuses and opens interesting options, your choice does not lock you into a \u201cclass\u201d. You are free to develop your character, distribute skill points, and choose abilities as you wish.\nUpon completing character creation, you are summoned to Crystal Sands, a city built directly outside the Dome as a staging point for personnel and equipment.\nThe transition station mounted at the apex of the Dome, above the only aperture, is called the Spire. After basic training, you will descend from the Spire into the Dome to land at Magellan HQ. \nThere is much to uncover during your first mission underground\u2026. Relying on your stats and Wing training, you will find there are several ways to resolve each challenge. Replayability is one of our main goals for the game. After your briefing at HQ comes your first task: exploring a newly discovered Forefathers compound tagged Object O-12-Nashville.\nAfter a few adventures inside the Nashville object (which we don\u2019t want to spoil just yet), your group encounters an entirely new anomaly. You awaken something dreaming deep beneath the desert of the Dome. Your trespass has activated Maelstrom, a telepathic entity created to serve the Forefathers. \nAll connection with the world outside the Dome is lost and Maelstrom rages across the desert, infecting the minds of everyone it encounters. You and your group fall into a technology-induced stasis for five long years. And when you come to, the entire world has changed. \nEncased combat is inspired by classic, tactical turn-based systems, with a grid overlay, action points, cover system, special abilities, various ammo and damage types, many different resistances, and more!\nThe player has direct control over his character only. You will manage the behavior and tactics of their your henchmen but their specific actions will be guided by the game\u2019s combat AI system, introducing funny and interesting situations into your battles.\nThere are dozens of weapons to be found, many of which can be stripped and upgraded. \nThe world of the Dome has from its discovery been a place full of weird creatures and dangerous traps. There\u2019s no telling what lies around the next bend in the road, or inside the twilit cave, or beneath the murky waters of the swamp. But who knows? Perhaps humans are the biggest threat in this bizarre land.\nMaelstrom dominates everything. It's telepathic rage sowing chaos in the minds of everyone, trapped under the Dome. But the player, having \"freed\" the entity, enjoys a special relationship with it. The two of you have regular interactions and Maelstrom may even grant \"whishes\" to the player... but be warned: every call for assistance will eventually incur a price. \nMaelstrom's power grows stronger the closer you move to the heart of the Dome, and that's exactly where you must go to find the answers. There is a special stat influencing interactions with Maelstrom: Psyche. Resistance to Maelstrom's negative effect can be developed in several ways, and develop it you must before you may venture deeper into the Dome. There is also a special skill branch related to Psychic abilities.\nWe will talk about Maelstrom and gameplay related to it in the future updates.\nFollowing the devastating events of Maelstrom\u2019s release, CRONUS splintered into multiple other, often warring, factions. The world has changed while you were in stasis, but has the nature of Man? Trapped inside the Dome like spiders in a jar, these factions will show the worst and best of humankind. Will you join them, or strike out on your own?\nLearn more about factions in our Kickstarter Update #2\nIf the player chooses to commit crimes against the society, he will incur penalties to his reputation and earn titles ranging from 'Petty Thief' to 'Enemy of the State' or even 'Threat to Humanity'. Crime begets punishment. The player may be fined, imprisoned, and even executed. Luckily, there are several ways to deal with your arrest: bribe judges, organize a jailbreak or return alive from the Labyrinth of Death (this last one may be particularly challenging).\nEncased features a day and night cycle with accompanying lighting effects. It would be wise to study NPC routines while adventuring.\nThe Dome is huge and for the most part is an open sandbox (if you are able to resist the psychic presence of Maelstrom). The map consists of more than 170 sectors, each crafted by hand. There are abandoned bunkers, black caves, the complexes of the Forefathers, as well as wastes, swamps and other biomes.\nRandom encounters have been a standby of the old-school role playing game since the dawn of the genre. But Encased will bring them to a new level. Each encounter is a separate post-apocalyptic story, not just a bunch of critters attacking you. Want to participate in a game of Russian Roulette? Find a pathway through a deadly anomaly to find a rare relic? Defend an automated rail transport from raiders? Or end up a victim yourself. All this awaits you, in addition to more classic encounters.\nRead more about Random Encounters in our Update #5\nGuest Stars and Experts!\n  Platforms and dates\nEncased is being developed for PC, Mac, Linux, PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch. Early Access for the Windows version will likely begin in the first quarter of 2019, exclusively on Steam. The final version will launch during 2019 on Steam, GOG and other services. The console edition is planned for the winter of 2020.\nDigital Rewards explained\nCRONUS employee ID badge\n\nAn employee using your name set out on an expedition in the desert\u2026 and vanished. Nothing was found but their badges. The mystery must be solved before it happens again. Will you accept the quest?\n\nMap\n\nA detailed map of the known world under the Dome, showing all the cities and settlements of the Foundation, along with the entries to the \u2018objects\u2019, explored and unexplored. Restricted to higher ranks amongst certain Wings, the map also indicates some locations that the Foundation would prefer to keep secret. A gift for those with the time and inclination to explore 30,000 square kilometers of desert.\n\nLorebook\n\nA digital version of the lorebook, containing all that is known and worth knowing about the Dome and the world within. The story of its discovery, an atlas of its most interesting sites, and an insight into the CRONUS Foundation \u2014 including never-before-told stories of some of its more secret projects \u2014 this is the only book a dedicated digital Domehead will ever need.\n\nSoundtrack\n\nThe hum of a machine of unknown origin, deep beneath the shifting, singing sands. Undeciphered signals from the Tower, snatches of CB radio and a quiet guitar arpeggio in a sleepy roadside bar. In the hands and mind of the Mushroomer \u2014 composer for Pathologic 2 \u2014 the desert becomes music.\n\nA short story about the Dome\n\nCharlene Putney, writer on the renowned Divinity: Original Sin 2, spins a tale of the events that followed the discovery of the Dome.\n\nPortraits\n\nAn extended set of hand-drawn in-game avatars, exclusive to campaign backers.\n\nClosed alpha and beta access\n\nHelp test the alpha or beta versions of the game testing.

In random encounters, the game picks a random name from a database. Your nickname \u2014 on our approval \u2014 will be one of them.\n\nBaseball card\n  Pretty much everyone supports the Crystal Sands Rogues baseball franchise - at least until they lose - and the players\u2019 baseball cards are collected and traded across the Foundation. Recruited from Orange Wing employees with talent and application, under-performing gets you cut from the roster - and getting cut sees you sent into the Dome.\n\nLife Pass\n\nFree lifetime access to all projects released by Dark Crystal Games.\n\nDesign a non-generic NPC\n\nWork with the devs to build a character - come up with their name, appearance, and role in the story.\n\nPlayer portrait\n\nYour face here. We will add a character avatar drawn from your photo to the game, and also give you a digital copy of the image.\n\n\nAn episode of the story-based mini-game, dedicated to you\n\nGames are popular under the Dome too. Some of the miraculously preserved terminals house a popular text game, the hero of which bears your name. Coincidence?\n\nDevelopers stream\n\nWe\u2019ll join you on a livestream of the game, for your audience or ours.\n\nA cool in-game item, exclusive to and chosen by the backers\nA rare gun? Custom armor? An unusual combat stim? You, the backers, will decide. But remember, it won\u2019t break the game\u2019s balance. We\u2019re not that generous.\n\nPhysical Rewards explained\nBlue Wing Engineer t-shirt\nIn vivid antifreeze blue, this fine t-shirt is the favorite of CRONUS technical staff, from the lowliest technician to the chief engineer. While not standard issue, most Blue Wing employees have one. And now so will you.\nRogues baseball cap\nThe Crystal Sands Rogues baseball franchise is largely recruited from Orange Wing employees with talent, aggression, and a desire to avoid entering the Dome. Last year\u2019s was a winning season, and none of the players lost their places. But luck shifts like the sands, and this year may be different. And you, the fans, can be less than forgiving.\n Explorer hoodie\nThe desert is cold at night, so each CRONUS employee who must venture outside is issued with a sweatshirt. Soft and comfortable, it offers excellent protection against the cold, so at least you won\u2019t freeze to death while you die of radiation poisoning.\nCRONUS Badge\nPrinted Lorebook\nThis 70-page glossy volume contains all that is known and worth knowing about the Dome and the world within.

However, despite our experience and best efforts, there\u2019s always a chance that something will go wrong. \n\n1. Early access and release dates. All of the people on our team have already delivered commercially successful games on time and in great condition. However, no true professional will ever tell you, that he is fail-proof. There is always a chance Encased RPG will require to postpone it's set final release date. At least to get an extra coat of polish.\n\n2. We might have delays in delivering our reward promises. The reward delivery channels are extremely reliable, but, there's always a possibility that the reward delivery could be delayed due to technical issues.\n\n3. We are used to dealing with budgets large and small. Financially speaking, Encased RPG budget has been calculated precisely. We are also financing most of the game ourselves, calling community only to finance additional features.

Never leave your tripod behind again.\nA quick and simple setup will empower you to take full advantage of every photo opportunity....4 seconds and you\u2019re ready to go.\nWe got tired of carrying around heavy, bulky tripods that we never ended up using. Lumapod is specifically designed to be brought on all your adventures.\n Instantly capture and share your experiences in the moment.\nOf course a fast setup and ultra-compact design are great, but what good is a tripod if it isn\u2019t stable? We carefully selected premium materials like high-grade aluminum and kevlar ropes to ensure reliable stability.\nUse it with your Smartphone, GoPro, Mirrorless, DSLR Camera and more...\nEasily use it to snap a selfie and then quickly set it down to capture a self-portrait. Either way you can always be in the shot.\nWhen you\u2019re not in the photo, use it as a monopod to shoot lively Hyperlapses\nThere is more that separates Go85 and Go120 than just their heights (85cm & 120cm). We carefully optimized both models for specific demands.\nLumapod Go85 \nWe relentlessly designed Go85 to be as compact and lightweight as humanly possible without compromising on quality or performance. The result is a perfect travel buddy for your smartphone, GoPro and cameras that weigh up to 1kg / 2.2lbs.\nUnlike Go120, it does not have interchangeable legs. However, it is equipped with integrated terrain levelers to accommodate for those situations with uneven ground.\n Lumapod Go120\nGo120 has all the benefits of Go85 but with an overall larger height and build that will support cameras that weigh up to 2kg /4.4lbs.\nIn addition, Go120 has modular leg extensions which creates a wide-range of possibilities for adaptability. It currently comes standard with terrain leveling extensions.\nEasily turn your Go120 into a slider with the add-on dolly wheel extensions.\nOr utilize the stake extensions for soft grounds, sand and snow.\n                                             Breakdown - Choose Lumapod if you\u2019re looking for better speed, compactness, weight and the adaptability of different leg extensions. Choose a standard tripod if you need extra stability and additional terrain flexibility.\nLumapod is compact with more height, better stability and offers the benefit of having both tripod and selfie mode.\nLumapod offers the same selfie capability but with all the benefits of a stable tripod as well.\nHave you ever wondered why all tripods look the same? Is there really only one design that works? We challenged this theory and worked tirelessly to design Lumapod different.\nThere is a simple mechanical principle behind our design: replace compression parts (traditional legs) with tensioning components (Kevlar Ropes). Perhaps it\u2019s easier to understand when compared to something everyone knows:\nMuch like how the mast on a sailboat withstands wind with its tensioned ropes, we use the same theory to achieve stability. It\u2019s no rocket science but the key to our design is being able to lock and tension Lumapod in any position.\nLumapod\u2019s stability isn\u2019t just by luck. We did extensive research and testing to measure the vibrations and damping of many tripods. Our electro-mechanical test setup enabled us to optimize Lumapod and ensure it is as stable as possible.\n                                             Showing the bigger steps of lumapods development\nHey!

I'm back on Kickstarter now for my 6th international cookbook project. In 2012, I launched my first project with Kickstarter: The Lotus and the Artichoke - Vegan Recipes from World Adventures, followed by the German edition (Vegane Rezepte eines Weltreisenden) in 2013. The series continued with English and German publications of: The Lotus and the Artichoke - M\u00c9XICO (2014), SRI LANKA (2015), MALAYSIA (2016), and INDIA (2017).\nThis year I traveled to Ethiopia in the weeks before Easter \u2013 one of several special times of fasting, when the majority of the country eats entirely vegan! I explored the central cities, traveled overland to the north, went trekking in the highlands and stayed with families in remote villages. \nAs with all my travels and culinary research, I am extremely grateful for the privilege to learn, share & exchange, and be guided & supported by many families and professional cooks who invited me in their kitchens and shared amazing meals with me.\nSince returning to Berlin, I've been cooking Ethiopian and Eritrean food practically non-stop, recreating recipes and dishes, constantly inviting friends and guests to my cooking studio for lunch and dinner parties.\nAbebech showing me traditional village cooking in the Ethiopian Highlands.\nMaking injera with the family in Gonder, Ethiopia\nThe Lotus and the Artichoke - ETHIOPIA is my newest cookbook with original recipes, artwork, photography and stories inspired by these latest culinary adventures. It includes over 70 recipes based on the mouth-watering meals in bustling cities & towns, at road-stop eateries, and in rural highland villages.\nAs with my previous 5 cookbooks, I have written, illustrated, cooked, photographed, and designed this book myself.

Crowdfunding is an awesome adventure. I enjoy the interaction with supporters, other cooks, bloggers, travelers, Kickstarter backers, and people from all over the world that love to dream, and help others with their own dreams.\nIn 2013, a small, indie publisher in Germany contacted me about being a publishing partner. I soon started working with Ventil Verlag and The Lotus and the Artichoke joined the emerging Edition Kochen ohne Knochen series of vegan & vegetarian cookbooks. It's an incredible partnership, and I enjoy working with an alternative publisher that understands the struggles and challenges for independent authors.\nBeing with a small publisher, my production costs and expenses for writing, cooking, photographing, illustrating, and designing my own cookbooks are not really covered.\nI am passionate about my projects, and know they have a value for many people. I'm here on Kickstarter to ask for your support and involvement, to help continue and evolve The Lotus and the Artichoke project.\nKickstarter LIVE cooking show. 2016.\nTHE STORY of The Lotus and the Artichoke\nIn 2012, my first Kickstarter project The Lotus and the Artichoke - Vegan Cookbook was successful with the help of over 360 amazing backers from around the world. It was my first cookbook in a developing series of books featuring my personal stories, photographs, artwork, and vegan recipes inspired by my travels and culinary experiences in 40 countries.\nIn December, the first edition of The Lotus and the Artichoke - Vegan Recipes from World Adventures was printed: 1000 copies in full color, featuring over 100 recipes and more than 90 full-page, mouth-watering photographs. The Lotus and the Artichoke quickly became an international sensation.\nAfter another successful Kickstarter project in 2013, The Lotus and the Artichoke \u2013 Vegane Rezepte eines Weltreisenden was translated and published in German \u2013 along with the second English edition.\nLater that year, I traveled to Mexico with my partner Julia and our young son Kolja, where we lived in a small town for 3 months, cooking (and surfing) with the locals. I documented our experiences and cooking adventures in my next book, The Lotus and the Artichoke - M\u00c9XICO which was published in English & German in 2014.\nThe following winter we spent 10 weeks exploring Sri Lanka. The Lotus and the Artichoke - SRI LANKA was published in 2015, following a sucessful third Kickstarter project with over 737 backers from more than 30 countries worldwide.\nI traveled around Malaysia, Singapore & Borneo for 5 weeks in early 2016 learning to cook traditional Malay, Chinese, and Indian dishes from the locals. The Lotus and the Artichoke - MALAYSIA was published that year, after another successful Kickstarter with support from all over the world.\nIn Autumn 2016 and Spring 2017 I went for my 7th and 8th trip to India to for six weeks of research and cooking on location in Kashmir, Ladakh, and the Northeast States. The Lotus and the Artichoke - INDIA was my most successful Kickstarter project, with support from 1,165 backers in over 40 countries.\nSince 2013 I have devoted almost all of my working hours to The Lotus and the Artichoke and other projects in the culinary field. In addition to writing my own cookbooks, I offer international vegan cooking classes, cooking demonstrations & shows, write recipes and do photography for other cookbooks and magazines. I also love to help others with translations, photography, design, and advice on their own projects \u2013 almost always dealing with art, travel, and food.\nLagos, Nigeria (World Veg Fest 2014)\nPRAISE for The Lotus and the Artichoke\n\"The Lotus and the Artichoke spiegelt Justins Erlebnisse und seine Liebe zum Reisen und Kochen so nahbar und umfassend wider, dass man so manches Mal meint, selbst dabei gewesen zu sein!\" \u2013 Nicole Just, Bestsellerautorin von La Veganista\n\u201cThe Lotus and the Artichoke shares Justin\u2019s love for cooking and world travel with such intensity and passion that you really feel like you were there!\u201d \u2013 Nicole Just, bestselling author of La Veganista\n\"Unser allerliebster verr\u00fcckter Weltreisender ist wieder da!\" \u2013 Nadine Horn & J\u00f6rg Mayer, Bestseller-Autoren von eat this!

"project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Hi there, adventurer! Looking for more dice in some unique designs and colors? You're in a good place!\nSome of you may already know that Q WORKSHOP is the manufacturer of some pretty unique RPG dice. We've been around for 14 years now, and we've produced so many dice sets that we've lost count already ;)\nThroughout the years we\u2019ve also created some dice designs that we loved but didn\u2019t make for various reasons: too many already scheduled releases, license ideas that just didn\u2019t work out, and so on. It hurt us deeply to have them hidden - and now we can finally give them a chance!\nWe're starting with 5 designs in one color version each. More to come!\nNo, these are not black blank dice ;) We will ask you to choose the design and color of the dice sets after the campaign ends - in our Pledge Manager. You've got time until then to decide!\nThe mat's format is B3 (353mm x 500mm, or 13.9in x 19.7in), and it's got Emil's awesome artwork on one side and a solid rubber on the other.\nAnd yes, you can also follow him on Instagram :)\nAlso, he's the guy who invented the famous April Fool's prank with the Furry dice.\nHere are some pictures of the real dice!\nThe Arcade dice feel the game! This is a real pic, not a render :)\nArcade Dice - real pic detail\nThe Bloodsucker dice all ready! Real pic, not a render\nBloodsucker dice - real pic detail\nAre you joining the fight? The Dragon Slayer dice are waiting!\nDragon Slayer - real pic detail\nHalloween dice - detail\nHalloween is comiiing! Real pic, not a render\nWizard Dice - charming already!\nWizard Dice - real pic detail\nChoose the Pledge Level - at this point, you only choose the quantity of the sets that you wish to order. They all have the same price. You'll choose the designs and colors in the Pledge Manager AFTER the campaign. You can pay the exact amount needed, or add an extra for some add-ons. You can also increase your pledge in any moment of the campaign.\nYou can get one additional die at no extra cost, if you subscribe to our newsletter here.\nIf you want to get some add-ons, you can change your pledge during the campaign - either by jumping to a different pledge level, or increasing the pledged amount.\nYour credit card will be charged after the campaign ends. Kickstarter then has up to 14 days to collect the payments, and after that it transfers the money to us so that we can start the production.\nWell, we've had some experience with it, and it is really a great place to be 100% sure that our product meets the customers' requirements. In this project, we just give you the options - and you tell us what you want. Isn't that the perfect solution?\nAlso, we just love the community feeling that arises around the campaign. There's some magic in it!\nOur dice are made of polymer: injection-molded and then painted. Each die is then polished and undergoes a thorough quality control.\nThe design is engraved in the dice, not just painted on the surface :)\nSo, you've found the most interactive section in this campaign! As the funding goal is not so high, we wanted to spice things up a bit and to offer you some opportunities to have fun.\nSo here they are - our Community Goals!\nYou'll find all the links in the buttons below!\nHow does it work?\nOnce a Community Goal is reached, the dice set with a specific design gets the matching dice bag. It's that simple.\nA maximum of 1 bag of each design will be added for free to each backer order.\nYou don't need to pay any extra cash or advise us in any way, we'll add the bags automatically to your order. If we manage to reach the goals only partially, (for example, we unlock 3 out of 5), only these sets will get their bags.\nSo, for example, if you order 3 sets (and let's assume that all bags are unlocked during the campaign), here's what happens:\n- if you choose to have 1 x Bloodsucker dice set, 1 x Wizard and 1 x Halloween Pumpkin, you'll get a matching bag for each one of those.\n- if you choose to have 3 x Bloodsucker dice sets, we'll only add 1 Bloodsucker bag to your order. You can also purchase the bag as a regular add-on, of course.\nThe unlocked bags will also appear as add-ons, so if you like them a lot, you can get more!\nYou'll find the link to the newsletter here.\nAlready subscribed to out newsletter? That's cool. We will compare the two databases after the campaign ends and if your e-mail is there, we will add the bonus D20 to your pledge.\n You can find them here :)\nAugust-September 2018 - campaign\nSecond half of September 2018 - campaign wrap-up: collecting pledges and importing the data to the Pledge Manager\nOctober 2018: filling out the info in the Pledge Manager\nNovember 2018 - January 2019: production\nFebruary 2019: fulfillment!\nFor our US backers: In the Pledge Manager you'll be able to choose between the more economical USPS shipping or more secure Fedex. Both shipping methods will have tracking available.\nThe shipping rates might go up depending on the final weight of the pledge and/or the add-ons that you add to your pledge.\nPlease bear in mind that these shipping rates are orientative only. The exact shipping rate will be charged in the Pledge manager after the campaign.\nAs with the previous campaign, we will organize the shipping for all US pledges from a US warehouse. The goal is to spare our backers the unnecessary customs fees. Once we know the exact quantity and weight of the packages, we will crunch the possibilities and decide on a one that is both reliable and fast.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've created and fulfilled two Kickstarter projects so far - the first one was fulfilled within a year, and the second one in seven months.

We wanted to shake up the Everyday Carry market by providing awesome, minimal products everyone can use on a day-to-day basis. Introducing NanoPen, the pen that goes where you go.\nWhen we say \"World's Smallest\", we mean it. Measuring in at a staggering 5cm in length, and 0.75cm in diameter, nothing else on the market comes close with the portability we offer.   \nIt's pretty F*CKING strong. Try to break it if you can. \nThis material is superior because it is particularly resistant to deforming. It's Mohs Hardness is rated at 9 which is higher than Titanium and Steel.  \nUsing a Tungsten Carbide tip, this pen is more than just a writing instrument. We've tested the NanoPen thoroughly to ensure that it is a perfect EDC tool for the toughest tasks.\nHave a neat idea? Sketch it out with ease. Fill out forms on the go. Puncture bothersome plastic packaging. Heck, even cut open all those Amazon boxes- The options are endless.  \nThe tungsten carbide ball is designed to be a perfect sphere that can grip any writing surface. Its surface is actually composed of over 50,000 polished surfaces and pits connected by a series of channels throughout the entire sphere. This design allows the ink to be present on both the surface and interior of the ball.  \nAt Slughaus we believe in pushing boundaries and elevating overall design & functionality in peoples lives. It's more than just a pen that fits on your keys, its a simpler way of living.  \nThe earliest design we have of a pen dates back to the late 1800's. These pens smudged easily and would leak, voiding them unusable. Fast forward to 1945, the ballpoint pen design we know today was perfected and patented.\nIn 2018 we like doing things differently, making the traditional ballpoint pen sleek and minimal, for you to carry ANYWHERE effortlessly.  \nWhen we say take your EDC further, we mean take it with you anywhere and everywhere. We aren't a traditional Every Day Carry brand. We like to get creative and give new meaning to the way you carry things.\n   Hook it on to your backpack, duffel, or keychain to ensure you never forget a pen when you're traveling on-the-go.\nAdd it to your favorite jacker zipper, and utilize it as a zipper pull.  \nNeed less bulk on your Keys? Add it to a traditional ballchain and wear it as a necklace.  \nNever lose your pen again.   \n      They say that size doesn't always matter. But it does when it comes to EDC.  \n     We've considered every possible aspect of the NanoPen from the size ratio of the key ring to body, to the finish of the metal to ensure proper grip when in use. We started from a standard pen and reduced it to an extremely minimal design, while giving it infinite function.\nIn order to perfect the NanoPen we had to go through various vigorous testing and revision. We worked with multiple pen manufactures to ensure our design was perfected to be the best tiny ballpoint pen on the market. Truly, there's nothing out there like it.  \n   SLUGHAUS is a small company based out of San Francisco with the sole mission of helping you stay minimal and functional. We believe that your everyday carry essentials influence your lifestyle. NanoPen's elegance inspires innovation, while its functionality keeps you on-the-go. We hope that our products not only help keep you minimal, but help mold your lifestyle as a whole.\nMEDIA KIT HERE\n ", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Single Pack", "descp": "Single Pack = 3 NanoPens.

This project was created as my own personal reminder, and to \"hang\" on to the memories that pushes us forward.   \n\" To all you fathers and fathers-to-be, and to all of you, who dedicate themselves to the coming generations.  This project is dedicated to you!\" \nHi Everyone!  In the blink of an eye, over 2 year's have gone by, and I find myself back here on Kickstarter once more. With this new project, I decided to go with something simple.  Titanium and EDCs are still my obsessions, so that's where the focus will be. I hope the design of the HANDGREY\u2122 KIN will strike a chord with you all.\nDESIGN PHILOSOPHY\nThe HANDGREY\u2122 KIN is my take on the simple key hook EDC, for your pocket, belts, belt loop, purse, messenger bag, or pretty much anything you want to hook your keys on to.\nI still rely on the bauhaus philosophy as my inspiration.  From then on, I let the lines and functions evolves.  The \"feel\" of the materials and the functions it serves, guides me toward the final outcome.  In this case, it  took on the design cues and curves, that harken back to the industrial era & machinery of the 1960s. \nWith a number of variations & iterations on the drawing board, I narrowed the final design to 2 different versions / models:  KIN {No.6}, and KIN {No.9}  \nThere are no functional differences between the 2, only aesthetics.  I like how the 2 models feel in my hands.  No.6 felt more modern, and streamlined, while No.9 felt more mechanical and succinct.  \nThis new series will retain my signature unibody design, with precision details. Each piece is individually cut via EDM WIRE-CUTTING technology, solely from Grade 5 / Ti-6Al-4V Titanium. This the most detailed and precise production method available.  It is very expensive, and usually reserved for prototypes and precision tooling only.  You can't get much better than this when it comes to cutting. \n FEATURES\nSimple hook with semi flexible spring clip\nExtra large inner clearance for hooking on thicker objects\nUnique micro-grip design to create a subtle grip.\nPremium Grade 5 / Ti6AL4V titanium \nSLOW EDM wire-cutting for the finest precision details\nCombination of Machine & Hand finishing, for best appearance\nHandgrey KIN + the ORBITKEY {canvas}\n        I will also be offering the pledges with the option of adding my Handgrey KNOX custom Titanium Key Ring.  This will be available to backers after the project ends.  \nHandgrey KNOX\nFINISHING\nI will be making the KIN in 2 finishes:\nSheen - Stone Tumbled Finish \nBright - Hand Brushed Finish\nStone tumbling comes in many different interpretation.  It sounds very simple, but quality finishes are very hard to nail down, and the machinery needed are very expensive.  It takes a lot of time to do quality work.  I strive to find the perfect balance that gives good results, with a faster production time. \nI prefer the natural color of Titanium above all else, simply because it's everlasting. It's the way nature made it. Anodization, and PVD / DLC coating are nice, but not very durable, no matter what the marketing says. I've worn through them all.   In the future, if I manage to find a better long lasting coating, or finishing process, I will offer a larger variation of final finishing for my design.  \nDedication ~ Fathers & Kings ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've been around Kickstarters for nearly half a decade with numerous project. You don't last this long by not delivering. The 10,000+ backers from my previous projects will attest to this.\n\nThe only risk I can foresee realistically, is TIME. There are factors that are beyond my control, such as delivery time for raw materials or turn around from our EDM manufacturers. Things happen, machines break, shipments get lost, etc., but we have enough experience to minimize and mitigate these factors to ensure that the project is not significantly affected. I will also get started much earlier than I did on the last project just to be on the safe side.\n\nI will be working with the same EDM and machining specialist in Thailand that I have worked with the last 4 years. These GURUs know how I work, what I need from them, and that I mean what I say. So I will continue to have them do what they do best: Exceptional Quality Work!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "In the Loop", "descp": "Just want to be in the loop, and keep up with the project !", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2018"}], "stat": ["5 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 17 or more", "title": "Minos - Personalized / Stone Tumbled", "descp": "1 X Personalized MINOS - micro ID key tag for your EDC set up.

Transform regular mouth mason jars into a comfortable pouring pitcher without the mess!  Pour hot liquids safely!  Lift large jars easily!\nFirst invented and patented in 1858, the Mason jar is named after its inventor, John Landis Mason.  Originally used in home canning and preserving, the Mason jar has become ubiquitous due to its usefulness. The jar is used for drinking, storage, canning or crafts.  The one thing that sets the Mason jar apart is its standard mouth size.  The regular mouth Mason jar is 2.75 inches (6.985 centimeters) across the top.  The Ergo Spout will fit regular mouth Mason jars, from 12 ounces to half gallon volumes.\nThe Ergo Spout fits Mason jars whether they were recently manufactured or are of vintage age. This is only for regular mouth Mason jars. \nThe Ergo Spout with different sizes of jars.\nThe Ergo Spout has three physical parts:  \nThe lid is completely removable. It connects inside the spout, creating a hinge for flip-top functionality.\nThe main spout has a curved lip to reduce dripping and connects to a handle that is comfortable and non-slip.  \nA gasket is underneath where the jar comes into contact with the spout.  This provides a complete seal, so there is no leaking between the base of the spout and the top of the mason jar.  \nThe Ergo Spout could become your favorite kitchen tool because of its versatility.  Use it with pint jars to drizzle homemade salad dressings or breakfast syrups.  Add the Ergo Spout to a quart for easy pouring of juice or serving gravy to your crowd.  Attach one to your vintage half gallon jar to brew your sun tea or lemonade.\nThe Ergo Spout will be made of food-safe polypropylene, which is BPA and phthalates free.  The material provides the strength to lift heavy jars.  It will not warp in the high temperatures of the dishwasher and microwave.\nThe Ergo Spout solves three basic problems with Mason jars.  \nFirst, because Mason jars are glass, they become slippery when wet.  With the Ergo Spout you can avoid those slippery jars and pour without the risk of dropping it.  \nThe Ergo Spout also allows the possibility of pouring hot liquids such as syrup.  Because your hand need not come in contact with the jar, you can safely pour that hot syrup on your pancakes.  \nLast, the Ergo Spout prevents sticky drips down the side of the jar by guiding the liquid to the curved spout.  \nThe Ergo Spout makes for comfortable, safe pouring without the mess.\nWe have been showing off the Ergo Spout and its development on social media. We are so happy with the love the Ergo Spout has been getting.  Back us today to get your very own Ergo Spout for your kitchen.\nThe Ergo Spout will come in your choice of three colors: Vintage Blue, Classic White or Barn Red.\n                SHIPPING INFORMATION:\nFor those who live in the United States, shipping will be added to your pledge and charged upon successful completion of the campaign.\nInternational folks!  As of the launch date we have determined that we will be able to ship to the following other countries at the estimated shipping prices.  Shipping will not be charged as part of your pledge to Kickstarter, but instead will be charged after the campaign is complete and prior to shipping.\nCanada (estimated shipping ~$18 USD)\nU.K. (estimated shipping ~$25 USD)\nAustralia (estimated shipping ~$18 for 1 Ergo Spout, ~$25 USD for 2 or 3)\nIf you don't see your country listed, please contact us and we will review policies and costs for shipment to determine whether we will be able to add you to the list.\nIMPORTANT:  International shipping costs do not include custom fees, taxes, duties or other charges for the product to enter your country.  Please take into account any additional amounts that you may have to pay in order to receive the product and ensure that the imported product complies with your national and local laws.\nStretch Goal #1 Once we reach $30,000, we will add a fourth color option. Backers will be able to vote on this color choice. The top color by number of votes wins! Woot Woot!  \nStretch Goal #2 If we reach $50,000, we are adding two additional color options (for a total of six for the campaign)!  There will be a second round of voting with colors added from backer suggestions.\nStretch Goal #3 If we hit $70,000, we have a surprise for our backers.  We will reveal the surprise once we hit the $50,000 goal.  Don't worry, you're going to love it!\nWhen my oldest son was younger, he LOVED pancakes with syrup. It might be more accurate to say that he loved syrup with pancakes. We went though A LOT of syrup at our house.  \nMy mother-in-law had taught me how to make a simple syrup with maple flavoring. It became a family favorite because it's easy, delicious and economical. She also gave me a fancy syrup dispenser. I loved it and used it all the time. Until...  \nOne day I chipped the edge while washing it. I searched the internet for a replacement, but couldn't find one. \nThen came the light bulb moment: wouldn't it be great if there were a spout and handle for Mason jars!  I looked all over for that too, but couldn't find it.  My husband, Bryce, and I decided to make one ourselves. \nNow, after laboring over a ton of versions for the last 18 months, we finally have it ready to manufacture.  We are ready to bring you the Ergo Spout!\nWhy do you call it the Ergo Spout?  \n\nBecause of the unique ergonomic handle.  \nWhat about a wide mouth version?  \n\nDue to interest we have decided to launch the Wide Mouth Ergo Spout with it's own Kickstarter campaign.  After the design, engineering and prototyping is done we will be ready to launch.  Look for it Spring 2019! \nWhat will it be made of?  \n\nThe Ergo Spout will be polypropylene.  Polypropylene is a food safe, non-toxic, BPA-free and Phthalates-free plastic. It will also have a silicone grippy over mold on the handle.  \nIs it dishwasher and microwave safe?  \n\nYes. The plastic will not warp in the high heat of a dishwasher or a microwave.  \nIs it air tight or does it seal?  \nThe Ergo Spout includes a silicone gasket to make a complete seal between the jar and the base of the Ergo Spout. We are working to make it as spill-resistant as possible with our flip-top lid. \nIs it dripless?  \nThe spout's design reduces dripping and will help prevent drips down the side of the jar. \nAre there different colors available?  \nYes, we are offering it in Vintage Blue, Barn Red, and Classic White. We will offer another color as stretch goals.  If the campaign achieve a stretch goal of $30,000 Backers will get to vote on the extra colors.\n                                                     Do you like the Ergo Spout video?

And while most recommendations focus on how much water we need to drink, not enough is said about how often you should be sipping on your water. The frequency and even distribution of your water intake during the day is actually the key to preventing dehydration.   \nThe new EQUA Smart Water Bottle is here to take your water intake \u2013 and overall wellbeing \u2013 to the next level.\nIt glows every time you need to take a sip of water  \nOnce you\u2019re thirsty it\u2019s already too late. EQUA will make sure to send you regular reminders every time its needed in order to prevent your dehydration.\nKnows your optimal daily water intake\nYou\u2019re an individual and you need a personalised plan for your optimal water intake. EQUA\u2019s APP will do that for you and become your healthy lifestyle coach.\nTracks how much water you had\nOnce you start following your water intake you\u2019ll find that on the days when you reach your daily goal, you\u2019ll feel more energised and more friends will comment on your glowing skin.\nCommunicates with you, even without the use of your phone\nA gentle tap on the bottle will reveal how well you are doing - with a slow glow if you\u2019re on track or a quick glow if you need to catch up.\nA companion mobile app for the EQUA Smart Water Bottle will help you keep close track of your hydration. The app recommends your daily water intake according to your body characteristics and lifestyle. It tracks your water intake and offers you an insight look in your hydration habits and analytics. You can also control the frequency of glow reminders on the bottle that will remind you when you need a sip of water.\nHelp us spread the word about EQUA Smart Water Bottle among your family and friends. We will randomly choose 100(!!) of you that\u2019ll share our campaign on Facebook, Instagram or Twitter and thank you with a free personalisation of your new EQUA bottle (please see FAQ section for terms & conditions).\nCombining smart technology with a sleek, attractive design, EQUA is crafted in three color options: Snow White, Dark Grey and Pink Blush.\nUsing EQUA bottle will not only have an amazing impact on your wellbeing, but will drastically improve your environmental impact. While bottled waters are conveniently available at our every step, too often we\u2019re not aware of the scary fact that plastic has been mass produced only since 1950\u2019s but we already have a mere 9.2 billion tons of plastic waste to deal with. A switch from disposable to reusable water bottle is a simple step with a big impact!\nThere are many possibilities how to measure your water intake with the help of the bottle and the app. For us the real challenge was to build the right technology with the best user experience. Our goal was to make the hardware part small, durable, functional and packed in a beautiful design. Our choice of technology was the motion sensor (accelerometer). The accelerometer is able to recognize your movements and calculate the amount of water you drink.\nHow it works?\nPLAY\n\nThe main innovation is in its software. We have developed a clever algorithm to understand specific bottle movements. We then use machine learning technology to translate these movements into useful data.

We've been developing award-winning products that push the boundaries of ergonomic mouse design and function for over a decade. This is our third Kickstarter, and thanks to our incredible supporters, we've previously raised over a million dollars in pledges - bringing our products to life.      \nWe\u2019ve gone back to the drawing board on our ergonomic pen grip mouse (Swiftpoint GT), improved everything that people loved, and added more innovative features. We're starting production and are super excited to announce Generation 3 of our pen grip mouse, called ProPoint\u2122\nKickstarter Exclusive Bundle - unbelievable value! \nWe want to launch the product with a huge splash and reward our early supporters. So to get it into as many hands as possible to spread the word, we\u2019ve put together a bundle that is surely the craziest and best offer Kickstarter has ever seen (short of giving it away!)\nUPDATE: Due to the amazing support, we've also been able to include a USB-C to USB adapter, free of charge to ALL backers!\nDouble up, and save even more...\n                                      Do you feel discomfort from your current mouse, or know someone who does?  \nWhether it's relieving current strain or pain, or prevention before it becomes an issue, your health is important...\nUltimate Travel Mouse \nIf you\u2019re sitting on a sofa with your laptop, in a cafe, on a plane, or in a train or bus - this is where ProPoint\u2122 shines - you can use it right on your laptop palmrest.  \nWhen you need to walk to a meeting or your next class, just close your laptop and attach your Propoint\u2122 to the magnetic parking spot on the lid.\nYou can connect via Bluetooth, or with the USB receiver (which also charges the mouse). \n                                Take Command of your Presentations\nNot only is ProPoint\u2122 the most comfortable mouse in the world, but with our gyro technology it's also a \u201cpresenter\u201d - meaning it\u2019s actually two devices in one.\nStand tall with the ProPoint\u2122 in-hand, and flick the switch to transform it into the ultimate presenter device. \nNavigate your slides and lead your audience through your presentation with the virtual laser pointer, you can even draw on the screen to highlight what matters most.\n...not only a mouse, it's also a presenter device\nFinally! A mouse for your iPad\nPrecision and Gestures for Designers & Power Users \nProPoint\u2122 not only gives you the full functionality of a three-button mouse and scrollwheel but, with our unique gyroscope technology, it opens up a new world of tilt gestures for panning, zooming and rotation.\nUnlike other mice that use the scrollwheel for middle mouse clicks, ProPoint\u2122 has a dedicated 3rd mouse button that\u2019s easy to click.\nYou can assign separate functions to all three buttons when the device is tilted, so there\u2019s actually 6 button actions right at your fingertips. Assign shortcuts to the tilt gestures, like app switching, and the actions you use the most. \nIn office programs like Word and Excel, use tilt gestures to effortlessly flick up / down, or even left / right. \nIn design programs like Photoshop and Illustrator, flick to the area you need to work on - without even pressing a button. \nIn 3d modeling programs, use tilt-gestures to effortlessly rotate, zoom and pan.\nPropoint\u2122 is the ultimate tool for designers and power users, in the office or on the go.\n                                   Tech Specs\nWe kept all the things people loved about Swiftpoint GT ...\nWe improved everything, and packed in even more innovative features ...\nOur Story \nWe\u2019ve been developing revolutionary products for almost 15 years and have a unique design ethic that starts with a clean slate, followed by an analysis of every minute detail of how we interact with our devices to complete daily computing tasks. \nWe put our designs and concepts through countless cycles of user testing and refinement - this gives us a deep understanding of ergonomics, efficiency, and intuitiveness, to create truly unique and innovative products.  \nWe're not only an ideas company, our team has decades of experience in manufacturing, production, sales, and logistics, and we've shipped tens of thousands of products to every country in the world.\nEverything we do is about making innovative and robust tools made to the highest build quality that we\u2019re proud to put our name on. Devices that make peoples lives easier and more enjoyable.\nLast year we launched \u2018The Z\u2019 - a gaming mouse that was voted gaming innovation of the year by CES.\nBefore that, we launched our ergonomically designed pen-grip mouse the \u2018Swiftpoint GT\u2019, which went on to become computer peripheral of the year.\nNow we\u2019re launching ProPoint\u2122 which is our next generation Swiftpoint GT device.

You will explore gothic locations, hunt down clues, discover artefacts, fight horrific creatures and face off against terrifying bosses.\nFor more details about the 'Box Full of Evil' click here.\nFor full details of what's included in the Darkness Calls expansion, click here.\n For full details of what's included in the Hellboy in Mexico expansion, click here.\nRESIN MINIATURES\nFor more details on the resin miniatures, please check here.\nDesigned by James M. Hewitt - the brains behind the likes of Blood Bowl 2016, Necromunda: Underhive, and Warhammer Quest: Silver Tower - Hellboy: The Board Game features incredibly detailed, pre-assembled PVC plastic miniatures that capture the unique look and feel of Mike Mignola\u2019s visionary work.    \nMiniatures supplied unpainted.\nHellboy: The Board Game gives you the chance to take control of an iconic member of the BPRD. Choose from Hellboy, Abe Sapien, Liz Sherman and Johann Kraus before equipping your agent with additional items that will help in the mission ahead. Each trinket, charm or weapon costs money though, so you\u2019ll need to spend wisely.    \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nEach of the missions in the core game begins by reading a BPRD Case File. This will set the scene for the investigation ahead and give hints about what threats you may encounter. The contents of each Case File are top secret, so the first time you play you'll have no idea what you're about to face!   \nMiniatures supplied unpainted.\nDuring play, agents must carefully balance the Information Gathered track against the ominous Impending Doom track. Information Gathered represents the clues you uncover about the monster you\u2019re hunting, while the Impending Doom track marks how close humanity is to the brink of destruction.   \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nDo you spend valuable time investigating the scene to find a vital piece of the puzzle that could expose a crucial weakness of your foe, but risk the Impending Doom track reaching its devastating finale? Or do you forget the clues and rush through to a final confrontation before the monster has gathered its strength? No one said being a BPRD Agent would be easy.   \nMiniatures supplied unpainted.\nAhead of the climatic battle, you\u2019ll have to face all manner of creatures that lurk in the shadows, ready to pounce at a moment\u2019s notice. When the chips are down, it\u2019s time to fight back using an intuitive system of custom coloured dice. Each BPRD agent has a range of special abilities they can use to defeat their enemies, or they can team up when things get really tough.   \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nWhat\u2019s more, no two missions will ever play the same thanks to the terrifying Deck of Doom. Each turn players unveil a Deck of Doom card, which could trigger a new onslaught from the arcane horrors hiding in the location, initiate a special event or simply move the Impending Doom track closer to its dramatic end.     \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nNo matter what your decisions are during the course of the mission, each play through will always end in an epic final confrontation with one of Hellboy's most notorious adversaries. The board itself changes to reveal the boss' lair and then all gloves are off for a desperate struggle against the forces of evil.  \nKickstarter exclusive box artwork drawn by Mike Mignola!\nWe currently estimate Hellboy: The Board Game (core game) will contain the following components*:\n10 double sided room tiles (2.5mm thick, a mix of 2x2 and 1x2 with a linen finish)\n4 Agent Cards\n50+ cardboard tokens (damage counters, HQ board markers, target priority counters, furniture, doors, flame markers, etc., 2.5mm thick, with a linen finish)\n13 custom dice\nThree narrative Case File scenarios (tarot card sized, 310GSM, lined finish, each scenario includes between 6-8 cards)\nCard HQ Board (linen finish)\n74 Mini Cards (310 GSM, linen finish, Encounter Cards, Back-Up Agent details, Equipment and Starting Items)\n48 Standard Cards (310GSM, linen finish, Deck of Doom Cards and Enemy Cards)\n18 plastic cubes (Agent action tokens and generic black tokens)\nColoured bases to fit on Agents\nRulebook\n*these are given as a guidance because the game is currently in development. We will keep backers updated with any changes to components\nBPRD ARCHIVES EXPANSION\nAlso included in your pledge is the BPRD Archives expansion. This is an opportunity for you to create your own BPRD Mission Case File. You start by choosing the location \u2013 will it be an abandoned mansion, spooky graveyard, or something more sinister? Then select the foe you want to face in the final confrontation or just leave it to chance, so it's a mystery until the dramatic climax!\nWork in progress Case File cards. Artwork/text subject to approval.\nOnce you\u2019ve created the Case File, it\u2019s time to make the accompanying Deck of Doom. You\u2019ve got complete control to make the game as easy, or as challenging as you want by selecting the Deck of Doom cards and then shuffling them together. These will then be drawn as you're playing through the mission.   \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nFinally choose your Encounter Cards. These will dictate what's inside each room and what monsters you will face. Combine these with your  Enemy Cards to battle against wild creatures, hideous Frog Monsters or Nazi soldiers. The choice is yours!  \nFuture releases and expansions will feature elements that can be combined with the BPRD Archives, so the experience will keep growing and the gameplay will keep changing long after you've finished your first adventure.\n   MINIATURES\nWe've worked extremely hard to capture the style of the Hellboy comics. Each miniature has been approved by Mike Mignola himself and we've taken his feedback on board to make them as stunning as possible.\nPLAY\n\nEach miniature will be made from high quality grey PVC plastic and will be pre-assembled, so they're ready to go straight from the box. As you can see in the image below some of the miniatures are huge and will look amazing during play.  \n The videos below use the prototype components we have been using for playtests. The designs/components used are definitely not final but will give you an idea of how the gameplay works.  \n\nShipping is NOT included in your pledge and will be calculated/charged once the campaign has completed. We recommend waiting until the pledge manager to add the exact amount required. See below regarding import duties and taxes.   \nWe currently estimate that the shipping costs for the pledges will be approximately:\nUK: \u00a39\nUSA: \u00a312\nEurope: \u00a312\nCanada: \u00a314\nAustralia/New Zealand: \u00a325\nRest of World: \u00a325\nAll add-ons outside the core pledges will have their shipping calculated and charged in the Pledge Manager after the campaign has finished.\nPlease note, we are unable to ship to these countries: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nWe are dedicated to our retail partners worldwide therefore we are delighted to offer you a retail pledge for our new Kickstarter.    \nInformation about the Hellboy retailer pledge can be found here.\nHellboy\u2122 \u00a9 Mike Mignola. All rights reserved.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are a number of risks with any Kickstarter project, especially getting accurate timings for such complex products with so many components. \n\nWith this project, the rules are currently in testing and will require more playtesting, however we have a dedicated team of playtesters to help with this. Many of the miniatures are already designed and approved by Mike Mignola but some are still in concept stage. Once we have all the miniatures designed, the next part of the process is the tooling and production. We predict that we will begin shipping in February 2019 - however, the exact timing is impossible to predict and there is always the potential for delay with products produced in China. We will of course keep our backers up to date as best we can once the project closes.\n\nTo date, we\u2019ve successfully fulfilled 11 Kickstarter campaigns: Kings of War, DreadBall, LOKA, Mars Attacks: The Miniatures Game, Deadzone, DreadBall Xtreme, Dungeon Saga, Kings of War 2nd Edition, Deadzone: Infestation, The Walking Dead: All Out War and DreadBall Second Edition.\n\nWe currently have four outstanding Kickstarters awaiting completion: the remaining Warpath vehicles are shipping to backers now, wave two of Star Saga: The Eiras Contract is currently going into production and is expected to ship shortly afterwards, TerrainCrate will begin shipping in May/June, and for Kings of War: Vanguard the miniatures are in tooling and resin is already in production ready for later this year.\n\nREFUNDS\n\nUpon request refunds may be given within 30 days of the campaign ending, including fees. Following that time, refunds may be given minus Kickstarter and payment fees.

This means some elements may differ from those shown here following the Kickstarter campaign.\n\nIf you do not complete the pledge manager within the time specified when the pledge manager is sent, you agree that your contribution to the campaign was a donation and your pledge is fulfilled. Of course, we will use our discretion on a case by case basis. Completing the pledge manager is the ONLY way for us to confirm your shipping address and pledge details, as well as making sure we hit the production timelines. \n\nBy pledging on this Kickstarter you agree that will pay for any shipping and any import or other duties required in your country. You also accept that you are liable for providing us with the correct shipping details upon request and we are not responsible for items lost in transit if sending to an incorrectly provided address. We also cannot ship to PO boxes and you must provide an alternative shipping in this circumstance.\n\nAlthough we are aiming to deliver Hellboy: The Board Game to Kickstarter backers before the game is available at retail, production and shipping delays can lead to delivery at the same time or following the retail release. \n\nIf you do not agree to these terms, then please purchase the game once it's available at your friendly local gaming store in 2019.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a395 or more", "title": "Agent Pledge", "descp": "Includes Hellboy: The Board Game, Conqueror Worm Expansion, BPRD Archives Expansion, Bonus Minions, Kickstarter Exclusive Alternate Hellboy, digital edition of Seed of Destruction graphic novel, and all applicable stretch goals.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["6,337 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a3100 or more", "title": "Retailer Pledge", "descp": "This pledge is ONLY for verified retailers, do not choose this option unless you are a retailer.

Last year we launched Panobook, a notebook for your desk. We are back again with a new project that pairs perfectly with it: Mark One, a minimal, durable, retractable pen. \n This is Mark One, in a nutshell:\nMinimal design. No superfluous details, not even a visible logo. Clean, simple, elegant, and it comes in two colors. \nDurable. The entire pen is made out of metal, and coated with a robust ceramic polymer coating, which gives the pen a great feel in the hand. \nRetractable. We wanted a click pen for our favorite refill, and we went to great lengths\u2014including a custom mechanism\u2014to make it happen. Satisfying as heck to click. \nThis whole journey started when we discovered a fantastic refill, beloved in the pen world: the Schmidt P8126 rollerball. It quickly became our favorite, so we thought, \u201cwe should make a great pen for this refill.\u201d So that\u2019s what we did.\nKeep scrolling to learn more! \nPerhaps unsurprising if you know us, but our design goal from the beginning was to design a pen that was both minimal and beautiful. Mark One has a completely seamless (literally) design, with no excess ornamentation or logo. This seamless design was quite an engineering feat, and involved designing a custom mechanism that can screw in from the back. The pen comes in two colors: black or white, which both have a slightly textured, matte finish. The metal plated nocks provide a nice little accent to each. We wanted the pen to be sophisticated without looking overly tactical or masculine. \nIt was also important for us to make something long lasting. Mark One is incredibly durable. It is made entirely out of metal; even the custom click mechanism is metal (more on that below). The pen is coated with Cerakote, which is an extremely durable ceramic-polymer coating. It gives the pen a really nice, matte feel. This pen should last a lifetime. \nWe decided early on that we wanted our pen to be a retractable click pen, but getting there was another story. There are many off-the-shelf click mechanisms we could have used, but none of them were quite right for what we wanted, so naturally, we are making our own mechanism. It is made entirely out of metal and, as far as we know, it is the only all-metal mechanism on the market that has an actual \"click\" action. It's extremely satisfying. We are quite proud of it!  \nMark One ships with our favorite refill, the Schmidt P8126 rollerball. This is a fantastic cartridge; the ink flows smoothly and dries quickly. This refill was popularized by the Retro 51 Tornado, and we wanted to make a pen that... didn't look like that. If you've never used this refill before, you're in for a treat. \nHowever, Mark One will accept any Parker style refill, which, if you are not a pen nerd, just means there are many options for pen cartridges that our pen will accept, like the Fisher Space Pen ball-point or various gels. This list from Well-Appointed Desk is quite comprehensive. \nThe Schmidt P8126 rollerball refill.\nHere are the details of the pen, however things may be tweaked slightly as we move to production. \nDimensions: 128mm long, 11mm diameter. (5in x 0.43in)\nWeight: 25 grams (0.88oz)\nAluminum body and mechanism. Nickel and copper plated aluminum knock.\nCerakote coating, matte finish. See technical specifications for Cerakote here.\nIncluded Refill: Schmidt P8126. Black ink with 0.6mm tip diameter. \nWe've had the design concept for Mark One for a while now, even before we launched the Panobook campaign (you can actually find early prototype Easter eggs in the video if you look for them). Once that campaign was a success, we knew a pen would be the perfect follow up. Although the design of the Mark One looks simple, we spent countless hours tweaking the geometry and design, and we reworked and redesigned the mechanism multiple times. It was a long journey to get to the current design, and we can't wait for you to use it! \nNot even scratching the surface of how many prototypes we made.\nSince everything about this pen is custom machined, there is a sizable upfront cost, as well as a minimum quantity needed to get this off the ground. If you are interested in supporting your new favorite pen, hit the green button to help bring the Mark One into existence.\nThanks for your support! \nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 400+ successful project with over $200MM raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are Kickstarter veterans, and have successfully funded and delivered 7 projects in the past.

Our original plan was to make the knocks out of aluminum and plate them with nickel and copper. We soon realized that while nickel plating aluminum is very tough and robust, copper plated metals can corrode over time, turning the shiny copper color brown (like an old penny). At this point we started looking at PVD (physical vapor deposition), a process used to color and strengthen metals (Apple uses a process like this for their gold colored Apple Watch, for example). We were told that titanium is a better metal for the PVD process than aluminum, which is why we switched to titanium knocks in a past update."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #8", "update_userinfo": "Big Update and Address Surveys!", "update_content": "Hey Folks!\nIt\u2019s been a while since our last update, and we have much to report.

Our products received rave reviews from many backers.  We are proud to be back with another extraordinary product.  Introducing: \nNot much bigger than the credit card it is built to carry, the extremely compact WYN can hold up to ten cards plus cash and receipts. It is constructed of exquisite carbon fiber, which is lightweight, strong and durable. The WYN Minimalist Wallet allows for fast card access, is completely secure, and is simply eye-catching.\nIf you want to comfortably carry more cards and cash, access them faster while shredding the bulk then the WYN Minimalist Wallet is perfect for you.\n\"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication\" - Leonardo da Vinci\nWYN is an advanced twist on the bulk of a wallet that bulges uncomfortably in your back pocket. Phones have evolved; they are smaller, easier to use and carry, so why not wallets? That is why we created WYN, a wallet not much thicker than the actual credit cards it is built to carry. WYN slips easily into any pocket, whether it be on your shirt or on your pants. It is so lightweight that you will not even notice it is there. You will find that WYN is the most comfortable wallet you have ever owned.\nWYN is only as thick as the amount of credit card you carry, whether it is 3 cards or 10 cards.  It is only 0.5 oz., about the weight of two US quarters.\nWhile being extremely compact WYN is still incredibly functional. It has all the functionality of a full size wallet such as holding cash and receipts. WYN also offers the added benefits of easy access to your most used cards, fast payments with card chips and full card view for phone orders. All of this happens quickly and effortless with just one hand. \nAdding cash is easy: press a finger to create gap, insert cash\nWYN's exquisite carbon fiber material and modern design makes it the perfect wallet for every occasion. It is comfortable during work, secure and lightweight for active wear, durable for the outdoors, and compliments any attire from casual to formal. \nDURABLE: Carbon fiber is used in aerospace and performance cars, well known for its superior properties of strength, flexibility and lightness.  We have spent countless hours perfecting WYN's design. There are no rubber bands, straps, screws or latches to wear or break over time. \nSECURE: WYN's innovative, patent pending design straddles both sides and applies just the right amount of pressure to keep your cards and cash securely in place.  They also stop the cards from moving side to side.  \nI had a car accident in 2015 and went to see a chiropractor. I complained about my back pain which seemed to be getting worse. He took some measurements and the results showed that my right side is about half an inch shorter than my left side. He told me it was the result of sitting on my leather wallet year after year. Many of his clients have had the same problem and they never even suspected that their wallet was the cause of the pain.   \nI started taking my wallet out of my back pocket before I would sit down. It was too big to comfortably fit in any of my other pockets. It was such an inconvenience and sometimes I forgot my wallet. I knew I had to find a better solution.  I wanted a wallet that was compact but didn't restrict the amount of cards or cash I could carry.  I wanted something simple yet functional while easy to use. I wanted a wallet that is cool, elegant and sophisticated so that I would be proud to carry it.  What I didn't want was any rubber bands, straps, screws or latches. \nIn early 2016 I had an aha moment and conceived a design for a wallet that meets all of the requirements, and more. We spent a lot of time refining the design using different materials and manufacturing processes. We tested plastic, aluminum, titanium and finally settled with carbon fiber. We ordered material from different factories and tested them. We've been using the WYN wallet for many months and we LOVE it. \nWe guarantee you will love WYN too!\nPrototypes\nOur gratitude to the following individuals (in no particular order) whose feedback, advises and involvements help bring this project to fruition: John Groth - Waterjets Design, Phil Kooken - Oak 2 Design, Josh & Joe Gray - Fractal Focus, Xuyen Huynh, Tyler Fetters, Matt Nguyen, Edgar Molina, Melody Caron, Trent Striplin, Riley McElroy, Allen Napoles. \n                     IMPORTANT NOTICE: \nPlease note that YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY CUSTOMS FEE, DUTIES, VAT, IMPORT TAXES, SPECIAL DELIVERY FEES ADMINISTERED BY YOUR GOVERNMENT, AND HANDLING FEES.

It makes all the pieces perfectly organized.\n  THE HISTORY\nOur first development was an ergonomic screwdriver. The product was shown to the most important screwdriver manufacturers, but they were not interested in it. The handle design had a small rubber ring made to protect the tip of the screwdriver and surfaces, like a wooden floor or a car veneer and this it the part of the invention they were amazed by.\nAfter that breaking moment, Michael W. Perez decided to improve this part in many more utilities creating a greater body structure and adding a powerful magnet. This is how the MAGNET DRIVER\u2122 50 was created.\nAfter the successful Kickstarter campaign launched in 2015 he decided to work on a screw holder for the common 1\" insert bits and \"Bitholder Classic\" was created. He added a new utility to this piece by inventing the revolutionary \"Bitholder Drill&Drive\". Finally he created compatible multi-purpose accessories, and the result of these developments is Magnet Driver Total Tools DDN, our new pack to Drill, Drive and Nail.\nCurrently Michael W. Perez works for Micaton company in R&D department constantly inventing and developing new tools for DIY enthusiasts and professionals.  \n    WHEN WILL I RECEIVE THIS INVENTION IF I BACK THIS PROJECT?\nYOU ARE OUR BEST COLLEAGUES\nYou are our best allies!

We heard you, loud and clear!\nToday we are happy to announce two new wide angle lenses to the Pinhole Pro family: the Pinhole Pro S11 (11mm) and Pinhole Pro S37 (37mm).\nPinhole photography predates any form of modern photography as the most fundamental form of photographic art. The forerunner to the photographic camera was the camera obscura \u2014 a permeative photographic device with no lens but a single pinhole aperture.\nContemporary cameras use state-of-the-art lenses, mirrors, mounts, AF/MF techniques, and endlessly higher pixel density to deliver amazing images, but those images are too life-like, lacking the charm of raw, naturally vintage look of pinhole photos boasting the most original saturated colours. \nPinhole is photography in its most original form. However, achieving that unforgettable photographic aesthetics requires high precision engineering and modern state of the art manufacturing technologies. With so many sub-par quality options on the market, as well as the ability for anyone to build their own, we saw an opportunity to not only build a pinhole lens that\u2019s beautiful with exceptional build quality, but also with precision engineering and rich inputs from the photographers and cinematographers themselves \u2014 the result was the world\u2019s first ever multi-aperture professional pinhole lens that supports virtually all modern digital cameras with interchangeable lenses.\nIn the early 20th century, the development of high speed films and mass production of glass lens almost made pinhole photography forgotten. It\u2019s a lost art form, only to be kept alive by the few enthusiasts.\nPhotographers turned to the endless pursuit of sharpness, resolution and speed. That trend still dominates today. However many photographers like yourself have started to realize that high resolution and high specs can not replace the authenticity of analogue photography that\u2019s more personal, original, unfiltered with a timeless 'point of view'. Pinhole photography provides exactly that. After all it is the closest to what a human eye can see.\nCreate photos and videos exactly the same way photos were taken hundreds of years ago, and pair that with modern high speed, high ISO technologies. The result is stunning and timeless.\nExperiment and have fun!\nPinhole photography is great for printing out. Paper gives pinhole photos timeless feeling.\nNever before, is professional pinhole motion pictures so easy and achievable. The vivid yet stunningly unique look of the pinhole cinema is something that\u2019s simply non-reproducible by digital.\nInstead of charging over $1500 for a professional made pinhole lens for cinematography, we offer a much more affordable option for movie makers and video artists with a much more dramatic offering:\n What lies in every Pinhole Pro lens, is the secret of how each tiniest yet perfectly precious pinhole aperture is made. The shape and edge smoothness of the pinhole aperture is one of the most critical factors in image quality and sharpness.\nUnlike most DIY and commercial pinhole cameras and pinhole lenses that use either mechanical pin punching, chemical etching or laser etching, Thingyfy uses a robotic controlled tiny micro-drill that is only 0.05mm in diameter, to preciously drill a perfectly round and smooth pinhole aperture. This process requires state-of-the-art environmental control and vibration reduction, in order to produce the stunning quality of each Pinhole Pro in mass production. Below is a table that compares the attributes of each pinhole production method:\nThe first three methods result in an imperfect pinhole, with pinhole apertures that are either too large, not round in shape, thick walls of the pinhole or with fuzzy edges \u2014 each of which will result in poor image quality.\nOne of the biggest challenges to create a super wide angle pinhole lens is the innovative engineering of the lens structure itself at a microscopic scale.\nIn order to achieve a whopping 120\u00b0 field of view at an aperture less than 0.15mm, the pinhole wall has to be leas than 0.1mm to eliminate the tunnel effect, or dark corners on the picture.\nThis is no easy task, as if the wall is too thin, the aperture plane of the Pinhole lens will be as thin as a tin foil, therefore easy to penetrate and warp. Thingyfy\u2019s engineer has developed an ingenious design x allows the aperture plain to stay as thick as 1mm, ensuring its strength and durability, while by precisely machining two opening funnels at opposite orientation, both allows a 120\u00b0 opening on each side, to let light rays pass through with no obstruction. \nPinhole Pro and Pinhole Pro S offer seven different lens mounts and four focal lengths, ranging from 11mm to 55mm. With the extension tubes that are widely available for each lens mount, it\u2019s possible to covert the Pinhole Pro to a wide range of focal lengths, taking advantages of the unique multi-aperture design.\nIn case you are pledging for Pinhole Pro S as a present for your loved ones and the event will take place soon.

And this time, it\u2019s serious.\nFive years ago, we came to Kickstarter with a simple mission: we wanted to make a better spatula for you. Since then, based on your requests and 100% born and raised right here on Kickstarter, we\u2019ve launched nearly three dozen products across six campaigns. But there are two products that have taken more time and effort than any of the others. Two products that deserved (heck, demanded) as much time and attention as the rest combined. These are the ones that kept us up at night. They also happen to be the ones you wanted more than anything else.\nIt\u2019s hard to explain our approach without a self-referential nod to our name and mission: Get It Right. When we design a product, we strip away everything and start from scratch. We imagine what it would be like to experience the platonic form of whatever it is we\u2019re working on. And then, we build.\nWhen you strip tongs back to the basics, you\u2019re not actually looking at tongs anymore. You\u2019re looking at hands. Tongs should be an extension of your hands - an extension that can get hot, messy, and extra grippy when the going gets tough. And to be a perfect extension of your hands, your tongs need to lock and unlock intuitively, just like your hands grab and release. No weird dongles to pull, tabs to slide, or upside-down gravity tricks. No using one hand to help the other. Just you and your tongs, lefty or righty, working together to get stuff done.\nTo achieve this intuitive one-handed lock experience, we developed a mechanism unlike anything else out there. It\u2019s patent-pending, and took us four years of meticulous engineering and prototyping to perfect. When we finally cracked the code, we knew we\u2019d hit on something special.\nGIR tongs lock and unlock with a simple squeeze. And once you\u2019ve got the muscle memory dialed in, it\u2019s addictive.\n\nSqueeze on the logo to lock. Squeeze on the grip stripes to unlock. Repeat.\nIt\u2019s a magical experience, and we are so excited to share it with you. But we didn\u2019t stop there.\n316 Stainless Steel\nWe\u2019re using 316 surgical grade stainless steel in the construction of every one of the tongs\u2019 parts. It\u2019s an extremely high quality material - in fact, we\u2019re not aware of any other tongs that use grade 316 stainless (and we've looked). You might have heard of 18/10 or 18/8 steel, both of which use a chromium/nickel blend and are commonly found in household appliances. 316 steel adds molybdenum to the mix, resulting in a material that's durable, biocompatible, and highly corrosion resistant. This stuff is the best of the best.\nFeatures\nErgonomic Design\nTo conceptualize the overall tong shape, we went back to a familiar form: the original GIR Ultimate Spatula. By splitting this shape down the center and making some thoughtful adjustments to size and proportion, we were able to create tong blades that conform to bowls and pans at an ideal angle, grip precisely, slide gracefully underneath delicate items, and provide an equally enjoyable experience for both left-handed and right-handed users. \nGently curved edges and softened cuts, along with a tapered overlap, make for an easy grip and completely eliminate the possibility of pinched fingers. And a 35\u00b0 angle when fully open is comfortable for hands large and small.\nWe\u2019ve also added grip stripes and embossed logos as \u201cX marks the spot\u201d indicators for locking and unlocking, so that you can use your tongs without even looking at them.\nSizes\nGIR Tongs come in three sizes. The blade shape, open angle, materials, and locking features are identical on all three of these tongs; we\u2019ve simply adjusted arm length for each of them to accommodate a variety of use cases.\nFor smaller tasks, serving bowls, kids, and tabletop use, the 9\u201d Mini Tongs will be your go-to. They\u2019re quite cute. But don\u2019t underestimate them.\nOur flagship Ultimate tongs clock in at an industry-standard 12\u201d. This size is the \u201cregular\u201d tong size you probably already know and love. It\u2019s great for all-around multitasking in the kitchen, and will keep your hands comfortably away from stovetop and oven heat. If you\u2019re only going to get one pair of tongs, this is the size we\u2019d recommend.\nAnd finally, our 16\u201d Grill tongs will be your backyard best friend. These extra long tongs will keep your hands well away from searing barbecue heat and can easily grip and flip just about anything you want to toss on the grill.\nColors\nWe\u2019ve got a thing with color. We love it. So naturally, working with metal didn\u2019t really stop us from keeping things interesting in the color arena. We\u2019re launching these tongs in three finishes (and who knows\u2026 more may be around the corner). \nHigh polish stainless\nOur team favorite. A bespoke polish treatment combining high gloss blades with a fingerprint-resistant matte stainless grip.\nBrushed stainless\nThe workhorse. These tongs will weather scratches and wear nicks with pride.\nLMTD Edition Black\nA titanized matte black finish, because you deserve tongs that look this dark. \nNonstick Safety\nNonstick-safe blades are in the works. We are planning to offer them down the line (or perhaps as a stretch goal), and will have lots of cool colors to choose from once we hit go.\nWhy didn\u2019t we just do nonstick in the first place?\nWell, there\u2019s lots to like about solid steel. For starters, it allows these tongs to have unibody arms that are sanitary, easy to clean, and extremely wear-resistant. It also makes for an extra precise grip. And honestly, we wanted to bring these tongs to you as fast as we could. The nonstick blade design has taken bit longer to perfect, so we\u2019re presenting the 100% steel versions first and paving the way for future iterations. In the meantime, use these tongs with care on your coated cookware. We\u2019ve got ours in the kitchen with pots and pans of all varieties, but we do work gently around treated surfaces.\nOur whisks might not look all that different from what you already have in the kitchen drawer. But they\u2019re full of surprises. Their features boil down to one basic idea: these whisks make you a better whisker.\nWhisking 101\nSo how do whisks work? When you\u2019re whisking, each wire pulls a stream of air through liquid to create a foam. More wires \u2014> more air \u2014> more foam, faster. So instead of the standard 8 to 10 wires you find on most whisks, we\u2019ve used 12. Right there, you\u2019ve got yourself a faster whisk. But there\u2019s more to it than that.\nWire tension, material, and spacing are also mission-critical for aeration and foam production. You want wires that vibrate vigorously to create turbulence and shear force in your liquid medium. Hardened 304 stainless steel wires, inserted under high tension, create max vibration and efficiency in the GIR whisk. And no wire should touch another, lest the vibration be dampened. We\u2019ve evenly distributed our wires around the handle circumference for better whisking at any angle, and spaced them for peak aeration.\nWe\u2019ve selected a medium-thin wire gauge (width) of 1.3mm that can handle thick batters, cookie dough, and sauces, but is flexible enough to whip eggs, cream, and vinaigrettes with no loss of efficiency. Each wire is inserted through a stainless steel cap and secured deep inside the handle. To create an oil-safe and germ-free seal over the insertion points, we\u2019re using a food-safe hardened epoxy that acts as an airtight seal over the entire assembly.\nStyle Equals Substance\nWe\u2019ve got half a dozen whisk styles in our test kitchen at any given moment (and more in the backup stash, of course). From French whips to fat balloons, we can find a place for each of them. But to design an all-purpose whisk, we set our sights on a \u201cskinny balloon\u201d shape that balances classic styling with the ability to get into tight corners.\nTechnique\nA note on technique: our friends at Cook\u2019s Illustrated have a piece to say about efficient whisking. For most tasks a side-to-side motion, rather than circular strokes, will take advantage of shear forces in the liquid to emulsify oils or whip cream much more quickly than any other motion. For viscous egg whites, a beating motion is preferred because taking the whisk away from the action with each stroke allows wider air channels to propagate in the liquid.\nErgonomics\nThe wires and handle are counterbalanced to reduce wrist fatigue, and avoid that messy moment when a heavy handle flips the whisk out of the bowl.\nTo top it all off, the handle shape fits every grip style and was designed with humanscale ergonomics in mind. And in case you\u2019re wondering, all those geometric facets make for an excellent non-slip grip and are molded from very comfy, platinum-grade silicone.\nColors\nLike most GIR products, these whisks come in a variety of clean and bright colors. Match your kitchen, make a statement, or stick with the neutrals. Most of all, go with what feels right!\nSizes\nThe Ultimate whisk is 11\u201d (280mm) from end to end, with a 4.5\u201d long silicone handle that\u2019ll keep your hands away from skillet heat. You\u2019ll use this whisk for most tasks - it\u2019s a versatile size for everyday use.\nThe Mini Whisk is 8\u201d (203mm) from end to end, with a 4\u201d silicone handle that fits the smallest of hands (hey kids!) and is just the right size for smaller jobs like stirring vinaigrettes or beating a single egg.\nPrototype to finished product\nDeveloping these tools has been an exhaustive process spanning four years and dozens of prototypes. We left no stone unturned in our search for the perfect tong mechanism, and destroyed many a whisk trying to uncover their secrets. From initial sketches and caffeine-fueled brainstorming to CAD modeling, 3D prints, and saying goodbye to great ideas that just weren't good enough... we've done it all. We're delighted to present these tools as the very best of their kind, and we hope you love them as much as we do.", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "CUSTOM PLEDGE", "descp": "Use this tier to customize a reward from the add-ons menu!

We'll demo products and answer any question you've got:\nWhat is all this?\nWe're Peak Design, a San Francisco based product design company. We're also the luckiest goobers on the planet; we engineer and make world-class photography gear, and we both shape it and share it with the Kickstarter community.\nWe've got new stuff, and you can pre-order it by backing this Kickstarter project. Your new gear will ship worldwide before the end of this year!\nThis is Peak Design's 7th Kickstarter project! Holy Toledo, we can't even believe it ourselves. This time around, with your help, we are making our best products even better.\nHow to back this campaign:\n1. Click \"Back this project\"\n2. Pick your reward level\n3. Want to add more stuff to your reward? Check out the Add-On Menu and increase your pledge amount accordingly\nFor detailed instructions, scroll down to the bottom of this page or see the FAQ.\nJump to: Add-On Menu | Reward Menu | FAQ\nWhat are we making?\nAll-New Capture v3\nIt's a metal clip that lets you rigidly carry any camera on your backpack strap, belt, or bag. Take your camera more places, keeping it secure and instantly accessible. Our new design is made of beautiful machined and anodized aluminum, and is smaller, lighter, more durable, and more comfortable than ever before. There's a also new Pro Pad for heavy rigs or all-day carry.\nAll-New Slide + Slide Lite\nThey're the world's most quick-connecting, versatile, stable, and comfortable pro camera straps, one for DSLRs and one for mirrorless. All hardware and materials have been updated for better comfort, smoother operation, increase durability, and gorgeous aesthetics.\nWhy did we make 'em?\nThere are a million straps, harnesses, and holsters out there for carrying cameras, and none of them met our needs. They were bulky, flimsy, frumpy, floppy, and frustrating. We knew we could do better.\nWhy are we updating them now?\nYou (our Kickstarter backers) brought Capture, Slide, and Slide Lite to life several years ago, and those earlier versions are really, really great products. Since then, we've learned tons, and we knew we could make these core products even better. Our backers demand the best, and we feel inclined to give ya'll just that.\nPeak Design has enormous plans for 2018. But before we start our next adventure, we had to give these three products the performance and aesthetic upgrades they deserve. Like momma used to say: dance with the one who brought ya. Now, let's meet these products:\n Capture: why is it so exceptionally dope?\nCapture is, in our humble opinion, the best damn way to carry a camera. It keeps your camera rigidly secure, yet instantly accessible with the click of a button. \n   Jump to:  Add-On Menu  |  Reward Menu  |  FAQ\n    Slide + Slide Lite: What makes 'em so freaking sweet?\nHave you ever used a traditional camera strap? You're probably all too familiar with bouncing cameras, clunky connectors, annoying shoulder pads, tripod incompatibility, and frumpy looks. With Slide and Slide Lite you get none of that, and all of this:\n    Jump to: Add-On Menu | Reward Menu | FAQ \n  Now for the nitty gritty.\nWow, you've really made your way down the page. Maybe that's because you're looking for more details. Well, lucky for you we didn't spare a single one.\nJump to: Add-On Menu | Reward Menu | FAQ  \nAnd now for the big question...\n    Reward Menu \nAdd-On Menu\nNot sure how to use the Add-On Menu? Read this FAQ.\nNot sure how to use the Add-On Menu? Read this FAQ. For more info on what all these products are, visit peakdesign.com.\nWhy such a short campaign?\nThere's a lot going on at Peak Design right now. We've launched over 20 SKUs in the last few months. It's almost holiday season. And, we'll soon be launching our own flagship retail store in San Francisco. We're keeping this campaign short and sweet so we provide top-notch service to our backers without dropping the other balls we have in the air. We also want to ship all rewards out before the end of the year! \nWhen will it all ship?\nWe expect all rewards to leave our warehouses by mid December. That means that many of you will receive awards before the end of the year and even before the holidays.\nPlease note that we cannot guarantee that rewards will ship by a certain date, and once rewards are in the mail, we have even less control over how long it takes them to reach your doorstep. We'll do everything in our power to get rewards out the door by early December, but we can't make any absolute promises. See the FAQ for details.\n  This project is promoted by Jellop, a direct\u00ad response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.\n       ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 7th Kickstarter project since 2011, so we've had ample time to hone our design, manufacturing, shipping, and supply chain management processes. Most importantly, we've gotten pretty darn good at setting our customers' expectations accurately and delivering on our promises.\n\nBut no matter how much we've got our poop in a group (official midwestern terminology) things can still go awry. If they do, we solemnly promise to give you full transparency into the issues and solve them in a way that leaves our backers happy and proud to support our company.\n\nSupply Chain Risk: Sometimes a machine or tool breaks. Sometimes a factory loses power for a day. Sometimes we get the wrong parts or materials in. These things happen from time to time and can affect how long it takes to build our products.\n\nShipping Risk: It's the holiday season, the busiest shipping time of the year. Every year, record breaking volumes can cause port congestion, over-stuffed warehouses, and shipping service delays.\n\nActs of God: We're based in San Francisco. That means we could have an earthquake. Or we could have the Wellness Coach Convention and the Artisan Toast Convention scheduled for the same weekend (can you imagine finding a place to brunch, let alone park the Subaru?!). Whatever happens, we'll get through it together.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "Slide Lite", "descp": "The small strap.

It has the practicality and versatility of a full-size knife\u2014but at a fraction of the weight, and the size of a house key.\nThe WESN Titanium Micro Blade EDC Pocket Knife\n        When I started making the WESN knife, I didn\u2019t have any grand ideas of starting a \u201cknife brand.\u201d All I wanted was a knife that I myself would want to own\u2014something reliable, practical, and made of the best materials. Plus, I wanted something worth every penny of the cost, and not a cent too expensive.\nThe story of how the WESN has come to be is long and unique\u2014but the best part is that the story isn\u2019t done yet. This is a knife I\u2019ll be able to hand down to my kids. And so will you.\nLanyard Hole to attach to your keychain\nThis knife is built to go absolutely anywhere you want to take it (well, other than airport security, of course). In fact, that\u2019s why it\u2019s called the WESN: West, East, South, North. Every direction, every destination, the WESN can go there.\nWESN assembly\n       When it came to actually making the WESN, you can bet your bottom dollar I did my research. I dug into what\u2019s behind all my favorite parts of different knives I\u2019ve owned. I asked people both in and out of the industry what made their favorite knives so special.\nI found out what kind of materials the best knives are made of. And then, I got to work. I ended up with a knife that\u2019s got the practicality and versatility of a full-size knife\u2014but at a fraction of the weight, and the size of a house key.\nA sleek and compact design\nBy using top grade components, the WESN is made with some of the best materials at an affordable price: grade 5 titanium and AUS8 steel.\nPartnering with the top knife manufacture overseas, we are able to produce the WESN out-of-country. This keeps the cost down for you and helps us get the knife into more hands. But even though we\u2019re taking these steps to lower the cost, we certainly aren\u2019t lowering our standards of quality.\nThe titanium makes the body simultaneously tough and hardy, while also dramatically reducing the weight. And by using AUS8 steel, the blade is durable, sharp, and made to last...and last...and last.\nWESN / Stock & Barrel Custom Sheath\nPlus, as an extra bonus for Kickstarter backers, we\u2019re super excited that we\u2019ve been able to partner with Stock & Barrel to create an all-natural Wickett and Craig\u2019s natural tooling leather Sheath specifically designed for the WESN and made right here in America.\nWESN / Stock & Barrel Custom Sheath\nI\u2019ve always been a huge fan of Stock & Barrel. Their commitment to quality design and materials made them a perfect match for the WESN in my mind. This case is just like the WESN\u2014made with integrity, and built for the long haul.\n     What can't you use this knife for? Well, I wouldn't recommend trimming your nose hairs... but hey: where there's a will, there's a way.\nThe WESN was designed to be versatile\u2014and I made sure it was by testing the crap out of it. With over 6 months of testing and usage, it's been able to do any task someone might ask of a knife. Even though the WESN doesn't have the specialized ability of knives built for specific tasks, you can know that the WESN will be up for the task, whatever you ask it to do. \n Here's a list of practical uses:\n...pry, cut, pick, flip, dip, nip... It\u2019s endless what you can do with the WESN... Only time will tell!\nProcessing firewood\n  Cutting rope\n  Fire starting\n    Opening a box\n                        Blade Length: 1.5\u201d (38mm)\nClosed Lenth: 2.25\u201d (57mm)\nOpen Length:  3.75\" (95mm)\nTotal Weight: 1oz\nHandle Material: Grade 5 Titanium body\nBlade Steel: AUS8 Heat Treated Steel\nHardware: Stainless steel\nFrame-lock \nPocket Clip\nKeychain Hole\nLifetime Warranty\n Every detail was considered when I was designing the WESN, from the steel I chose for the blade, to the shape of the pocket clip.\n It was my goal to create a compact, high-quality knife that won't get in your way. Whether you choose to carry it on your keychain, in your pocket, or with a custom Stock & Barrel sheath, it will carry far and it will carry well. \n    I believe in this knife, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s got a lifetime guarantee. This is a knife we\u2019ll be able to hand down to our kids. Wherever you take it, whatever you use it for, the WESN can handle it.

I've carried everything from a 3\u201d folder to a multi-tool, but nothing ever satisfied me or quite delivered what I was looking for. Everything was either too big, heavy, or ugly, or just not practical enough to carry around with me everywhere I go. So, a little over a year ago, I set out to create what I consider the perfect pocket knife.\nStarting from a simple sketch on a piece of paper all the way to manufacturing a working prototype, the WESN has been a long and exciting journey. I've been committed to quality the whole time\u2014 so there's been a lot of starting over to perfect each and every aspect of the knife. I've considered everything, from which screws to use to how thick the blade should be. Then, I personally tested the knife. I'm happy to say it's passed my own test, as well as the simple\u2014but all important\u2014test of time.\nEarly Development Concept Design\n  Blueprint designs\n  WESN Hand Made Prototype\n  PLAY\n\n  WESN Dimensions\n             ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith a background in product design, it has been my commitment from the beginning to create the best product possible.\n\nWith a little over a year of development, the WESN is in the final stages. All the necessary steps\u2014from design to prototyping\u2014have been completed, and the materials are in place to begin manufacturing. Once the project is complete and funded, we'll be able to get the gears rolling and begin production as soon as possible. \n\nI have been working closely with my machinist and manufacturer to ensure the WESN is ready for mass manufacturing and the delivery dates are in place.\n\nIf the WESN Micro blade is successfully funded, I commit to making sure all steps are completed and delivery is met as promised. The funds raised from this Kickstarter will be used for production and manufacturing. \n\nOur goal is to deliver all rewards on schedule, but if demand is higher than expected or unforeseen challenges arise, we could see a delay in delivery. \n\nDevelopment of the WESN has been a long road, and I\u2019m excited to get this knife into your hands. \n\nThank you for making the WESN story a reality,

Read more\nWhether you\u2019re new to the Pathfinder\u00ae universe or you\u2019re a seasoned veteran, Pathfinder: Kingmaker\u00ae is the CRPG you\u2019ve been waiting for. \nHere at Owlcat Games, we love and are inspired by classic isometric computer RPGs like Baldur's Gate, Fallout and Arcanum. Our dream is to rekindle the thrill of playing those games for the first time. Building your hero, exploring the unknown, getting to know your companions, experiencing the adrenaline rush of your first battle (and your last), delving into mysterious dungeons, and\u2014most importantly\u2014seeing your protagonist and your world change through your actions.\nWe've always been big fans of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game\u00ae from Paizo, Inc\u00ae, so we thought: How cool would it be to do this in the beloved Pathfinder setting? Paizo agreed, and with your support, we hope to bring a brand-new fantasy saga to life.\nWhat the press says\n\"If the alpha build was any indication, then there\u2019s plenty of opportunities to shape your own identity and leave your mark on the world.\" - Gamespot\n\"Almost everything I asked about in terms of story seemed to have a layer beyond what I expected--the advantage of having years of tabletop playtesting, perhaps. If these different aspects of Kingmaker can coalesce into a dramatic whole, this could be special.\" - IGN\n\"For fans of the tabletop game, this will be a great opportunity to translate their fantasy adventures to their desktops.\" - Game Informer\n\"First impressions from in and around the bandit lord's fortress; the game looks incredible. The in-progress menus are attractive and orderly, the environments lush and vivid, the character portraits appealing and refined. What voice acting there was, was convincing and professional.\" - mmorpg.com\nThe Game World \nPathfinder: Kingmaker is the first single-player computer RPG based on the acclaimed Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. The game invites players to Golarion, a world rich with history, mystery, and conflict, and gives players the chance to claim part of this world as their own.\n\"Follow the white rabbit, Baron\"\nPathfinder has considerable depth, not only in its lore, but also in its game mechanics, and in the freedom it offers you to develop your own unique character. You can customize your character with a wide range of classes and powers including specialized archetypes, powerful arcane and divine spells, choosing from a multitude of class abilities, skills and feats. Pathfinder allows players to create heroes (or villains) that fit both their individual gameplay styles and their personalities.\nUse night to your advantage \u2013 and see the world change.\nThe Story\nIn the north lies the Stolen Lands, a region that has been contested territory for centuries. Hundreds of kingdoms have risen and fallen in these lands, and now it is time for you to make your mark\u2014by building your own kingdom! To do so, you\u2019ll need to survive the harsh wilderness and the threat of rival nations\u2026 as well as threats within your own court.\nThe only easy day was yesterday.\nPathfinder: Kingmaker is based on Paizo\u2019s award-winning Pathfinder Adventure Path of the same name. You certainly don\u2019t need to be familiar with the story, but if you are, you will encounter characters you know and love. Either way, you will experience a host of brand-new events, companions, allies, and threats that expand and enhance the original Adventure Path. With help from Paizo and their authors, the story and quests have been expanded by RPG writer Chris Avellone and the Owlcat team, allowing for even more adventure in the already rich narrative of the Stolen Lands.\nWhile Pathfinder: Kingmaker is a single-player game, you won\u2019t be adventuring alone. Pathfinder: Kingmaker features a diverse cast of companions and NPCs, including iconic characters from the Pathfinder setting itself. You\u2019ll need to decide who to trust and who to watch carefully, as each companion has an agenda, alignment, and goals that may differ from yours. Your journey will become their journey, and you\u2019ll help shape their lives both in the moment and well into the future.\nMore than 10 companions to watch your back\u2026 or stick a knife in it.\nYour Kingdom \nWe chose to adapt the Kingmaker adventure path because it features a host of open-world mechanics, allowing players to experience the story at their own pace as they explore the Stolen Lands, which will challenge you as both an adventurer and a ruler.\nYou never know what's around the next bend.\nMost importantly, the game allows you to claim these lands as your own, letting you carve your own kingdom from the wilderness. While classic dungeon crawling and exploration lie at the heart of this adventure, diplomacy, politics, and the ability to lead troops in the field are also part of the challenge. Choose your allies well, and keep them close while exploring ancient tombs and ruins\u2014and while dealing with politics in your own court.\nThere are many ways to manage your Kingdom, and many rewards to be gained.\n As you\u2019ll discover, building a kingdom goes beyond simply building a stronghold: Your kingdom is a reflection of your character and your choices throughout the game. It is a living thing shaped by your alignment, your allies, and your ability to lead your people. Not only can your kingdom expand, opening up new territories and allowing you to build new towns and communities, but your capital city will physically change based on your decisions, your policies, and even whom you choose to ally with. As your kingdom grows, a number of factions and neighboring countries will come to you to seek favor\u2014and to test your strength.\nIf you fail, your kingdom will be destroyed, but if you succeed, you\u2019ll have made a nation where countless others have failed.  \nYour kingdom awaits! Do you have the strength to rule it?\n\nAre you a benevolent ruler or a ruthless tyrant?\n Expanding depth and richness of kingdom gameplay is so important to us that we\u2019ve made it our initial goal for the Kickstarter. Every pledge made toward our initial funding target will result in more features, more content, and more polish for your growing nation. Our goal is to let you build a kingdom that fits your play style. Perhaps you want to control every single activity in your kingdom by yourself, or perhaps you are more of a top-level ruler who wants to spend time exploring the wilderness and fighting dangerous beasts. Either way, we will give you the life you want to live. You are a king, after all!\nWe are excited about the kingdom mechanics and we have carefully planned all the features we would love to implement if you support us. All funds will be distributed according to the following pie chart:\nExpanding the kingdom is our first goal for the Kickstarter, but it\u2019s not going to be our only goal. With your support, we can improve every aspect of game. We\u2019re prepared to announce additional stretch goals to diversify the characters you\u2019ll be able to build, including the introduction of archetypes (at least a couple for each of the classes), additional classes (we have been asked about Magus several times\u2014and some Owlcats really want to play this class!), and additional races. We also want to develop the storyline further, expanding it beyond the Adventure Path, and we would like to include even more companions, each with their own alignment and agenda (including a companion that\u2019s dear to hearts of Pathfinder fans). We also want to bring you even more locations to visit, including an epic dungeon. We want to enhance our game with more voiceover and music. And we want more players to experience our game by adding additional language localizations, and support for OS X and Linux!\nWe don't just want to reward your support through stretch goals alone.

Dining on those meals will provide your party with different small and pleasant bonuses.\nOwlcat Games was formed by developers who have the experience, resources, and - above all - the passion required to make Pathfinder: Kingmaker a truly amazing game.\n We are a new studio, but we are not new to the industry. Many of us worked on these games as part of Nival Interactive and My.com:\nWe can't deny ourselves the pleasure to name just a few games Chris Avellone worked on:\nOwlcat Games team.\nPathfinder: Kingmaker has an existing schedule, an existing scope, and an existing budget, and that budget will allow us to achieve that scope on schedule. We already have a full team of people working on it, and we're committed to doing it regardless of what happens with this Kickstarter. So why are we asking for your help? The answer is YOU\u2014we need YOU to decide how big Pathfinder: Kingmaker is going to be. Success in this Kickstarter will allow us to increase the budget and the scope, delivering a bigger and deeper game on the same schedule.  \nAll of us\u2014RPG fans and developers alike\u2014deserve a game that demonstrates the richness of the Pathfinder universe. There are so many interesting things in the world and in the rules that we can\u2019t fit into the current budget, yet our desire to add them to the game is practically unbearable. We dream of more companions with added depths to their stories, new classes, new dungeons, more wilderness to explore, more kingdom events, and even brand-new quests and custom content by famous Pathfinder and CRPG authors. With this Kickstarter, our only limit is your support and your faith in us. Help us make Pathfinder: Kingmaker the product we all want it to be. Help us kick the epicness to the stratosphere!\n\nLooking to customize your reward tier a bit?

It's a dream come true to design and publish RPG games, and we're incredibly excited by this opportunity.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for games to be delayed. Unexpected challenges sometimes occur, but we have a strong expertise in video games and a plan in place to minimize any obstacles to production. We\u2019ve done due diligence during our vertical slice and we know exactly how long it takes to create assets (dialogues, levels, models, animations) for our game. As such, we are pretty confident that the game will be on the digital \"shelves\" in summer 2018.\n\nPathfinder: Kingmaker is being developed under license from Paizo Inc., with their full support. Products presented on this Kickstarter page and during the campaign may be subject to change in order to meet the expectations of our licensing agreement with Paizo.\n\nThe largest unknown element will be the number of backers, which affects the amount of labor needed to fulfill the rewards for those backers. You will notice many of our rewards have limited quantities; these are to ensure that we are able to satisfy our delivery dates. When some of these reward categories fill up, we will add identical reward categories with adjusted shipping dates. We do this to maintain quality and ensure you receive your rewards on time.

Oh well, all your dreams can't come true, right?\nWrong. When the issue of porting the game to consoles came up, we realized pretty fast that something had to be done about combat. Micromanaging the party in combat, particularly important at high complexity levels, is extremely difficult when you have a gamepad instead of a mouse and a keyboard. Of course, we could try to improve the artificial intelligence of the player's characters and make it customizable, but this didn't seem a good solution: we'd play AI programming, not Pathfinder."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #74", "update_userinfo": "Beta Test for Pathfinder: Kingmaker Update 2.1 is now Live!", "update_content": "Pathfinders,\nIt is less than a month until the release of Pathfinder: Kingmaker Definitive Edition for PC and consoles.

We are back with a new project: Panobook, a notebook for your desk, and eventually, your shelf. \nHere is Panobook, in a nutshell:\nThe unique panoramic format (160 mm x 288 mm) is designed to sit nicely on your desk, either in front of, behind, to next to your keyboard. \nEach page contains a subtle dot grid, with guide markers to help with layout. \nWe really sweated the details. All of the materials have a premium feel and are very nice. \nPanobooks are designed to be kept. Put it in the included slip case, annotate it if you want, and line a bunch up on the shelf.\nKeep scrolling to learn more!  \n  It all started with an insight about how we use notebooks. Even though we spend 8 hours a day doing digital work on a computer, notebooks are an essential analogue tool. We noticed, while sitting at a computer, it would be great to have a notebook directly in front of us. But that would require a different type of notebook, one with more of a panoramic ratio. So that\u2019s what we made.\nPanobook works great on a desk, either in front of, behind, or to the side of your keyboard. We wanted to create a notebook that was always open and always within arm's reach.\nIn using a prototype of the Panobook, we realized its unique format opened up some interesting creative possibilities. In landscape, it is fantastic for things like UI flows, storyboards, weekly calendars, Gantt charts, comic strips, level design, bullet journals, etc. Open up the notebook fully to get an even wider view. Rotate the notebook 90 degrees and you\u2019ve got a mini legal pad, great for list making, note taking, webpage layout, giraffe doodles, and more. We were surprised by how the unusual format seemed to get the creative juices flowing.\n        We designed the pages to help creative folks get their work done. Every page has a very subtle dot grid, with a twist. We\u2019ve included guide markers that make it easy to quickly draw three rectangles on the page, sized ideally for smartphone UI design or storyboarding. We also included edge guides to divide up the page and provide layout cues. The guides virtually disappear if you are not looking for them, but are very useful when you need them.\nEach page is 160 mm x 288 mm (6.3 in by 11.34 in) and the dots on the grid are spaced 5 mm apart.\nGuides for three 16:9 boxes.\n  Vertical and horizontal midpoint guides.\n  5 mm dot grid on a 288 mm x 160 mm sheet.\n  Being two fussy designers, we paid attention to every last detail in this notebook. The paper is super high quality, and performs well with a variety of writing instruments without smudging or bleeding. We consulted with several pen nerds and paper experts to help us find a fantastic paper, and we think we found it. It is Finch Soft White Ultra Smooth 70 lb text, if you're curious. Each notebook contains 50 sheets / 100 pages.\nFinch Soft White Ultra Smooth 70 lb.\nThe front and back covers are rigid, with an amazing soft touch feel. Panobook is bound with a robust wire-o binding, which allows the notebook to sit flat when opened. An insert in the front of the notebook contains a place for record keeping, as well as metric and imperial rulers and a type size reference. \nWe think you will appreciate all the care and attention to detail we put into this thing.\n  The front and back covers are rigid, with a slightly textured, soft touch feel.\n   The front insert.\n  Lastly, Panobook was designed to be kept. It comes with a slip case, which is meant to be the final resting place for your notebook. You can write on the spine to catalogue the notebook, and it looks awesome when you line several up on a shelf. We've noticed a tendency among designers to hang on to their old notebooks, and Panobook helps facilitate that. \nThere is a spot to write on the spine of the slip case for archival purposes.\n   The slipcase.\n  Panobooks lined up on a shelf.\n  We've wanted to make a notebook for a while now. We went in several different directions, but the \"ah-ha\" moment came when we started to consider how a notebook could be uniquely designed for desk use. We spent way too long fussing over materials and details of the notebook. Every last detail was considered, and we think you will be pleased with the end result. \nIf you want to learn more about the design process behind Panobook, be sure to listen to our podcast episode specifically about it! \nLots and lots of paper samples.\n  Printing projects such as this one are required to be paid in full to place an order, and are only cost effective if you reach a certain quantity threshold. We are on Kickstarter to gauge interest for Panobook, and see if it can gather enough pre-orders to make it a reality!

He's the award-winning composer of 'The Last Door', and other remarkable indie titles like 'Pharaonic' (by Milkstone), 'Six sides of the world' and 'Rotor'scope'.\nThis time around, he will be directing the work on both the Original Soundtrack and the audio design.\nListen to the first theme of the soundtrack:\nIf you don\u2019t know the works of Carlos Viola, we recommend you start by checking out his amazing work for \u2018The Last Door\u2019, available on Spotify.\n  We\u2019re a tiny development studio that focuses on creating meaningful playable experiences. We proudly specialize in delivering great games, despite operating with scarce resources. Maybe, you've heard about our previous work, a playable homage to classic horror writers (Lovecraft, Poe, & Machen):\n'The Last Door' is an award winning point and click horror adventure. It\u2019s a series of 8 playable episodes, developed using crowdfunding between 2013 and 2016. Initially, they were launched for browsers, but now you can enjoy them in their Collector\u2019s Editions for PC, iOS, Android and Windows Phone.\nOur previous title, \u2018The Last Door\u2019, was developed together with its community, with frequent discussion, beta builds, and incorporating community feedback in every possible way. For \u2018Blasphemous\u2019 we want to take this concept even further.\nWe offer our backers several levels of involvement with the project\u2019s development:\nThe Penitent (20 $) an up: We love transparency! Any pledge that includes the game will give you access to frequent development updates.\nThe Follower (25 $) and up: This pledge will grant access to a private development forum, where you will be frequently asked for feedback, participate in polls and help us with decision-making, plus access to the game's beta.\nThe Disciple (40 $), The Immortal (200 $) and up: you\u2019ll get access to our private channels on Slack/Discord, where all the design discussions will take place, one-on-one conversation with the development team, enjoy monthly (unfinished) builds and all future prototypes of the game.\n      The work on Blasphemous started in November 2016. The first stages involved the creation of the first bunch of concept art, to explore the artistic themes we wanted the game to feature. We\u2019ve been working non-stop since then, and indeed completed some key milestones along the way.\nWe are now preparing to switch from pre-production to production, and that\u2019s when we need you on board!\nWe\u2019re currently prototyping the second layer of gameplay, involving narrative and exploration mechanics. We're in the process of measuring the production scope and testing every required production pipeline. After that, we will confidently enter the production stage!\nFrom there, we have laid out a roadmap of frequent milestones (please note these dates are subject to change, although we are confident in our production dates):\nJune. 2017 - Aesthetics prototype (If the campaign succeeds, available for all backers, for Win/Mac/Linux!)\nSep. 2017 - Win/Mac/Linux Narrative prototype (The Disciple pledge or above required).\nNov. 2017 - Win/Mac/Linux Player\u2019s progression prototype (The Disciple pledge or above required).\nQ2, 2018 - Win/Mac/Linux Alpha (The Disciple pledge or above required).\nQ3, 2018 - Win/Mac/Linux Beta (The Follower pledge or above required).\nQ1, 2019 - All Platforms Global launch.\n                      So far, this project has been completely fueled by our own money. Bringing the game to Kickstarter now will enable us to get the extra funds we need to fully realize our artistic goals while retaining full creative control. For us, and particularly for Blasphemous, this is critical because of the potentially controversial topics we are featuring in the game.\nAt the same time, it creates a community around the game we can rely on to make the game truly awesome! While creating our previous game \u2018The Last Door\u2019, we experimented with opening the development process to the community. It was not only the most amazing experience, but it also helped the game become really extraordinary, reaching quality standards that we never hoped to achieve on our own, thanks to the collective intelligence.\nLet's make another game together!\nEngage the developers in our DISCORD server\nFollow us on Twitter:\n@BlasphemousGame\nFollow us on Fadebook:\nFacebook.com/BlasphemousGame\nOfficial website\nPresskit()\n This project is promoted by Jellop, a direct response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhen you are about to embark on any project there will always be a certain amount of trepidation.

However, we are experienced developers, having successfully steered a three-year development project right before this one, so we feel confident we will know how to manage the unexpected.\n\nSome of the areas of expertise required for this project are beyond our skill set, particularly the ones related to porting the game to consoles, and the ones related to marketing. We will seek strategic partners to go where we cannot go on our own. \n\nFinally it\u2019s worth mentioning that due to the controversial and mature nature of some of the themes and visuals, we may have to prepare ourselves to fight a couple of battles against censorship, political correctness or etiquette here and there, but we\u2019re confident that if we have the support of you backers, we will be able to manage it in a way that it is satisfactory to most parties.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "The Thankful", "descp": "Not sure if you'd want the game, but you still want to give a hand to the developers, be kept in the loop and receive the backer-exclusive campaign updates.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}], "stat": ["283 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "The Penitent - EARLY BIRD", "descp": "Be among the first backers to receive a 33% discount on The Penitent reward tier!\nINCLUDES:\nDigital download (Steam or GoG/DRM-free) for Win, Mac & Linux\nInstructions on PDF\nWelcome kit: wallpapers, ringtones and other digital goodies", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}], "stat": ["499 backers", "Limited (1 left of 500)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "The Penitent", "descp": "Get 'Blasphemous' the game when it's done!\nINCLUDES:\nDigital download (Steam or GoG/DRM-free) for Win, Mac & Linux\nInstructions on PDF\nWelcome kit: wallpapers, ringtones and other digital goodies", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}], "stat": ["2,146 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "The Follower", "descp": "Get the soundtrack, access to the Beta and have a significant impact in the game's final form by participating in development discussions and polls.

So far, the findings have been incredible.\nGravity uses the power of proprioceptive input (more commonly known as \u201cdeep touch pressure stimulation\u201d), a well regarded therapeutic method that stimulates pressure points on the body linked to improved sleep, mood, and relaxation.\nThe result is a reduction in cortisol levels and an increase in serotonin production, which decreases heart rate and blood pressure.\nEven hospitals use weighted blankets to calm patients' anxiety and promote deep, restful sleep. In a similar way to swaddling an infant, the weight and pressure on an adult provides near-instant comfort and relief.\nhttp://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J004v24n01_05\nhttp://www.somna.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Pilot-study-of-a-sensory-room-in-an-acute-inpatient-psychiatric-unit.pdf\nGravity is designed to hug you back at night, closely mimicking how a parent swaddles their child while they sleep. But Gravity isn\u2019t just for sleep. It can be used while you\u2019re reading in bed, as you relax on your couch, or while you meditate.\nBest of all? Gravity is engineered with breathable materials, so you\u2019ll never be too hot underneath the covers.\nThe world around you is a stressful place. The barrage of news headlines. The incessant push notifications. The demands of your job. It\u2019s never been harder to turn your mind off, relax, and recharge.\nThe average American now spends 30 percent of their leisure time browsing the web, and 61% of us admit to being addicted to our devices.

As a result, we spend nearly two hours a day recovering from distractions.\nSleep loss, prolonged anxiety, and stress take a real toll on our lives\u2014they decrease productivity during the day and can lead to long-term health problems like diabetes, obesity, and even heart disease. \nWe know your anatomy is unique, which is why we\u2019ve engineered Gravity to meet your personal needs. This isn\u2019t a weighted blanket for everyone. It\u2019s a weighted blanket for you.\nWeighted blankets should be around 10% of your body weight, which is why we\u2019re offering 15, 20, and 25 pound options. Choose your preference (suggested based off of weight).\n But Gravity is more than the science that engineers it. From beautiful design to thoughtful materials sourcing, we set out to craft a product that looks and feels as great as it performs.\nTaking design cues from renderings of gravity planes, we used the same grid-like pattern to evenly distribute the crafted poly pellets to specifically target pressure points throughout your body.\nThe cover is made from a luxurious, ultra-soft micro plush fleece, and is easily removable for washing. The inner shell is made of 100% cotton.\nThe Weighted Filling\nGravity Blanket's weighted filling is a High Density Plastic Poly Pellet. The material is odorless, non-toxic, and food grade, making it perfectly suited for use in a blanket. They are dense to add weight, and soft to provide a nice texture to the Gravity Weighted Blanket. High Density Plastic Pellets are manufactured using High Density Polyethylene (HDPE), which is extremely durable, non-toxic, washer / dryer safe, and pet and kid friendly.\nApril-May: Run Kickstarter \nMay-June: Kickstarter complete-Production begins \nJune-July: Production completed \nJuly-August: Product ships to our bi-coastal fulfillment houses \nSept-Oct: All Kickstarter rewards delivered just in time for fall!\nPLAY\n\nGravity is a health technology company dedicated to naturally improving physical and mental wellbeing through research-driven science.\nOver the past 12 months, we pored over medical research and studies about the effects of weighted blankets on serious conditions like autism, PTSD, and insomnia.\nFrom there, we set out to take this science and make a product that could help everyone. After much trial and error, we\u2019ve arrived at a prototype that people love.\nOur manufacturing partners are ready to go. All we need is your support so we can deliver stress relief to your door.\nMy whole life, I've been an entrepreneur. I'm obsessed with brands, customer experience and making the people in my life smile.\nMy career has been focused on bringing products to market; from pillows, to fragrances and handbags, and now, a blanket for sleep and relaxation.\nBefore creating Gravity, I founded a media company called The Good Ones, a product review site and web series where I test and try any and every brand I can get my hands on, and give honest recommendations to consumers.

We designed the Regatta Chronograph models with the firm belief that style should never get in the way of function but should naturally derive from it.  \n  Rossling & Co. has been crafting watches for over 5 years; with the Regatta Chronograph being our sixth collection. We have developed strong expertise in design, manufacturing and fulfillment and have solid relationships with experienced manufacturing partners. \nEvery component of the Regatta is made from superior materials to ensure flawless operations for years to come. Our watches are designed to be an heirloom, to be passed down to the next generation. \n    Quality leather is not only durable and hard wearing but it develops a beautiful and unique patina as it ages. We use buttery soft Italian calf leather for both the outside and the lining. After you wear it for a few days, the strap will conform to the shape of your wrist for a custom fit.\n5 models in the Regatta collection feature stainless steel mesh straps (also known as shark-proof straps). All versions are 100% waterproof and corrosion resistant. The adjustable clasps makes for a perfect fit.\nThe watch case is made of highly polished stainless steel (316L) for ultimate durability and strength. The caseback is made of the same material. Water resistance is rated at 50m/165ft/5ATM.\nThe Regatta Chronograph collection showcases 3 different dials (black, white and navy), all with a classic, crisp design. The dials feature applied hour markers and a square date window at 3 o\u2019clock.\nChronographs have been used for centuries for maritime navigation. All Regatta models feature a quality quartz chronograph movement with a 4 min per year accuracy.\nIn addition to time and date, the watches feature 3 chronograph functions: elapsed time, accumulated elapsed time and split time, all with a 1 second accuracy.\nThe watches will be numbered and hand-assembled as a limited edition. Only 359 serialized watches will be made for each model. Each watch will be delivered with an international warranty card and a certificate of authenticity.\n    PLAY\n\n  Named after the Hamptons on the eastern tip of Long Island, world-famous summer playground for high society.

It superimposes an image of your subject onto your paper. You see your pencil and your subject at the same time. Trace what you see!\nBack on Kickstarter!\n In 2013, along with fellow Art Professor Golan Levin, I launched the NeoLucida project on Kickstarter. Our goal was to make this amazing\u2014but obsolete\u2014tool available again. We hoped there was a small group of art/tech/history nerds like us who might want to try a camera lucida, but couldn\u2019t afford a vintage one. To our surprise, over 11,000 (!) backers helped us make many more NeoLucidas than we ever planned. Most had never heard of a camera lucida; they just wanted to draw and the NeoLucida gave them an entry point. We scaled up production by bringing Kickstarter veterans Big I Design on board as manufacturing partners. We even won a prestigious Core77 Design Award along the way! There are now over 25,000 NeoLucidas helping people in 90 countries draw from real life. \n\"Um, this is hard!\"\nOne thing became clear from the feedback. People said, \u201cThis is harder than I thought!\u201d We said, \u201cWe know!\u201d After all, the original NeoLucida copied the prism design of vintage 19th century camera lucidas, which made sharp, clear images, but has a tiny viewing area. To us, it supported the idea that great artists of the past were still incredibly skilled; using a tool wasn't \"cheating.\" This was a provocative media archeology project: NeoLucida users could test what it was like to be an artist 200 years ago. \nBut thousands of people were just excited by using a tool that might make drawing a little less frustrating. Many people appreciated the art history story, but they just wanted to draw. Maybe they used to draw and gave up as a teenager. Maybe they never learned to draw but always wanted to. Many parents wanted to support their kids' creative impulses. The NeoLucida offered an accessible and inexpensive motivation to draw. \nI was inspired. Years of lecturing and running NeoLucida drawing workshops in a half-dozen countries gave me direct exposure with hundreds of aspiring artists. With all the feedback in mind, I went back to the drawing board. \nAfter two years of research and testing prototypes, the NeoLucida is back! People asked for a larger viewing area, but why stop there? The all new design has an extra large viewer to make drawing from life just a bit easier. Say hello to the NeoLucida XL.\n  First, A Little Art History.\nIf you wanted to make a realistic image in the days before photography was invented, you had to draw it.\nFor centuries, artists and inventors developed clever optical drawing instruments to assist with the difficult task of drawing from real life. Devices with mirrors, lenses, and prisms helped with the most challenging part of drawing: flattening a three-dimensional world into the two dimensions of your paper.\nPortrait of Mrs. John Mackie, by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, 1816 (Photo by me while doing research at The Victoria & Albert Museum, London). Ingres' drawings are meticulous but tiny, leading some scholars to suggest Ingres used a camera lucida\nDrawing would be so much easier if you could hold up a piece of glass to your subject and trace its likeness directly onto the flat glass. Your page and your subject would be aligned; you wouldn't have to look away from your subject to see your drawing. Simple devices like the Sighting Grid did precisely this. Instead of glass, a grid of wires made a reference plane. \nSighting Grids by Robert Fludd (Left) (1617-21) and John Bate (right) (1634). The simplest of drawing instruments, the Sighting Grid provides a flat reference plane for translating the 3D world to the 2D page\nSighting Grids were accurate, but slow and cumbersome. As optical technology advanced from the early 17th century onwards, artists and inventors found ways to project images onto paper for tracing. The most advanced of these technologies was the camera lucida, invented by scientist Sir William Hyde Wollaston in 1807. A prism acts like a beam-splitter: part of your vision is directed towards your subject, part towards your paper. This overlap makes it possible to trace directly from real life. \nThe NeoLucida XL borrows from this tradition of simple, effective drawing instruments, but leveraging some modern technology to make a simple and inexpensive version of these ancient tools. \nWant a little more history and a look at the vintage tools that inspired the NeoLucida? Check out this chat and demo with Norman Chan of Adam Savage's Tested.com: \nHow does it work?\nThe main suggestion we got for the original NeoLucida was: \"Can't you just make the prism bigger?\" Actually, no. When you look into the prism, you look at the exposed edge of the prism. It doesn't matter how big the prism is, you still look at the edge. And as the prism gets bigger, the more the image shifts when you move your head. This is bad for tracing (trust me, we made and tried larger prisms. No good). To make the viewing area bigger, the NeoLucida would have to be completely redesigned. Ditch the prism and find other materials to create the ghost reflections.\nThe NeoLucida XL setup: Clamp to a table, position the viewer over your page with your subject in front of you.\nThe NeoLucida XL uses mirror and glass to combine a virtual ghost image of your subject and the real view of your hand. Setting it up is easy: \nClamp the NeoLucida XL to a table or sturdy drawing board. \nBend the adjustable gooseneck so that the viewer is facing your subject and positioned over your paper. \nLook straight down into the viewer to see your page and a ghost image of your subject superimposed. \nTrace what you see!\n  Part of your vision goes through the glass to your pencil. Simultaneously, part of your vision bounces off the glass, then the first-surface mirror, then out to your subject. The result is a ghost image on your page. \nLook down into the NeoLucida XL and a ghost image of your subject appears on top of your page.\nHere's an actual view through the NeoLucida XL. You can see your hand and your subject superimposed. This drawing only took 4 minutes, but proportion and perspective are rendered accurately. Tracing really works!\nNo matter your skill level, the NeoLucida XL helps you make more accurate drawings. Proportion\u2014the relationships between elements of your subject\u2014and perspective\u2014accurate rendering of space\u2014are laid out for you in the ghost image. You can even compose your scene before you draw so your subject fits on your paper the way you want it to. All of this means you can focus on the most important part of drawing: putting pencil to paper. Controlling a pencil to make beautiful lines takes practice. With the NeoLucida XL, you spend less time on laying out your drawing and more time drawing. \nSpecial Features\nThe basic elements in the NeoLucida XL are simple enough: A piece of glass and a mirror placed at a certain angle to each other. This arrangement is the same as it was in the early 19th century. After testing dozens of samples and prototypes, we've developed the NeoLucida XL to be the best version of the glass-and-mirror camera lucida ever made. \nGlass and Mirror. The quality of the glass and the mirror are key to make the camera lucida ghost image as sharp and clear as possible. The mirror we use is a First Surface mirror. Typical mirror is made with a reflective surface applied to the rear of a piece of glass. This is how most commercial mirrors are made. Because the light travels through the glass to get to the mirror, there are additional reflections from the glass surface and tiny distortions from scattering light. This isn't usually a problem for your bathroom mirror, since the mirror is thin and you're not standing that close to it. But if you want a precise reflection with your eye up close to it, you need a sharp reflection. Usually used in scientific applications, a first surface mirror has only one surface reflecting light rays. One surface exposed, one crisp reflection. \nTypical mirror (left) has a reflective surface on the rear face of the glass. This causes minor distortions and soft reflections as light bounces and scatters between reflective layers.\nPortability. Making the NeoLucida viewer larger makes drawing easier, but it also makes the device bulkier. To make the NeoLucida XL as portable as the original NeoLucida, the glass-and-mirror viewer neatly folds into a flat package. Slide it into the custom pouch provided, and toss it in your bag with your art supplies. Easy! The folding action also protects the glass and mirror inside a sandwich of hard plastic to keep the delicate optics safe while in transit. \nThe NeoLucida folds up for easy storage.\n  At just 10 ounces and slim in profile, the NeoLucida XL fits in the handy custom pouch provided. Easy to toss in your bag!\n  When folded, the NeoLucida XL is only 1 inch at its thickest. Compact!\nLegacy Support. The NeoLucida XL is an all new optical design, but it uses the same adjustable gooseneck from the original NeoLucida. If you have the original NeoLucida, you can swap viewers between the gooseneck stands. Save space! Carry both NeoLucida viewers but only one clamp!\nLighting Control. The NeoLucida XL comes with a removable shader to help balance the lighting. It's like custom sunglasses for your NeoLucida! Is the page too bright to see the ghost image?

At 8 and 4 years old, the NeoLucida's requirements of precise eye placement with a tiny prism made it frustrating to them. The NeoLucida XL isn't a toy, but it was made with kids in mind. I've tested it with kids and found that, depending on the skill level, children as young as 6 and 7 can draw with the NeoLucida XL! \nThat's my 8-year-old daughter using the NeoLucida XL to draw her favorite teddy bear. Fun!\nAlmost every child draws. But many give up in their teenage years when drawing skills don't seem to improve. Practicing with tools like the NeoLucida XL to advance skills can help keep kids drawing into adulthood. \nBacked by Primary Research\nThe NeoLucida XL isn't just a product, it's the result of years of primary research. As an art professor, the NeoLucida is part of a decade of research into the relationship between technology and art history. I have one of the most complete camera lucida collections in the world, and have used this personal collection to reverse engineer both the original NeoLucida and the NeoLucida XL. \nOne idea, a century apart. The Magic Art Reproducer (left) from 1952 and A. Alexander's Graphic Mirror (right) from 1840 both use angled glass and a mirror to create the ghost image.\nThe glass-and-mirror design is inspired by several different historical designs. The desire to draw more accurately from life is an old one; 19th century finely crafted brass devices and mid-20th century toys all responded to demand from aspiring artists. \nVintage glass-and-mirror camera lucidas from my personal collection provided primary research for developing the NeoLucida XL. At left, the 1952 Magic Art Reproducer. Center, A. Alexander's Graphic Mirror (1840).\n  Two years of NeoLucida workshops gave me first-hand experience with users. Clockwise from top left: Demo at Open Hardware Summit, MIT; Manifest Drawing Center, Cincinnati; Anderson Ranch Arts Center, Aspen; Children's Camp, Valdai, Russia.\nRewards\n(Prices include WORLDWIDE shipping!)\nLet's get drawing!\nWho's behind this? \nI'm Pablo Garcia, Associate Professor at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC) and the history of drawing and technology is my life. I've spent a decade researching historical and contemporary drawing techniques and tools. I have over 30 different camera lucidas spanning 200 years, making it one of the largest and most complete private collections of its kind in the world. I also run drawingmachines.org, a growing archive reference site covering 600 years of drawing technology. With Golan Levin, I made the award-winning NeoLucida in 2013, earning over $424,000 from 11,406 backers in our first-ever Kickstarter. I also exhibit art and lecture about art, design, and technology. Find out more here. Or tweet me!\nManufacturing partner Big Idea Design is Chadwick Parker and Joe Huang. Veterans of 21 Kickstarter campaigns, Big Idea Design has earned over $1.4 million from their high-quality titanium pens and clever tool designs. As manufacturing partners for the original NeoLucida, Big Idea Design helped us scale from a few hundred planned units to tens of thousands after our Kickstarter went viral. \nWant to keep up with NeoLucida?

We've got our manufacturing process down, and I have been to China several times to oversee production. So are we confident that the NeoLucida XL will be delivered as promised? Yes. But there are some new challenges we have our eyes on: \n\n\u2022 The new NeoLucida XL has some moving parts the original NeoLucida didn't have. When we get to producing molds there is a chance that parts don't fit or move smoothly. We have a plan to do final prototype modeling before we invest in the injection molds, but if there are problems, there's a chance for a delay if we need to make new molds. \n\n\u2022 The glass and mirror are thin and very precisely cut to be as flat as possible. This gives the truest image for tracing. We have planned for a higher-than-usual spoilage rate before we assemble the NeoLucida XL to account for possible irregularities and damage as we produce and package the NeoLucida XL.\n\nBut our team is battle-tested and have been manufacturing high-quality NeoLucidas together for three years.

The Kickstarter was a major success for us, reaching our stretch goal of $11,000. The EP came out in February of 2013, and was followed by shows and touring in the U.S., as well as appearances in the UK and Germany. It was a blast.\nFor quite some time now (years, actually), many of you have been asking when we would be doing a new album.

There are a few pieces of gear we want to add to our studio rig to make the recording better, and we're currently looking at a few different engineers to mix the album.

( messing up our plans for the year, which were meant to build on these shows) and, as bad news tends to come in threes, we got the news that our building is going on the market to be sold, and will

Another significant development is that Zone Zero (our studio) has moved location; we have moved from a 20\u2019 X 12\u2019 rehearsal space to a full scale, purpose-built recording studio (pictures below). The space is awesome, but has required a fair bit of work and TLC to get it up to spec, so this has been another major time suck of late."}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 20, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/303880739/the-bellwether-syndicate-new-album-project", "project_name": "The Bellwether Syndicate \u2022 New Album Project"}}, {"backer": "Rajiv Patel", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "We have taken everything we've learned from the award-winning original Roadie Tuner and upgraded it in every way imaginable. \nDid you miss out on this Kickstarter campaign?

Touring musicians spend vital minutes during sets to manually switch their instrument from one complicated tuning to the next. No matter your experience level, tuning can be a chore and take time away from playing.\nRoadie 2 is an automatic string tuner that is quick, easy to use, and three times more accurate than the human ear.\nIt\u2019s fully standalone and uses vibration detection to tune in even the noisiest of environments. Roadie 2 is compatible with any string instrument with a guitar machine head including 6-7-12 string guitars, ukuleles, mandolin, banjo and many more. When using Roadie Bass, its new more powerful motor allows you to tune Bass guitars as well.\nRoadie 2 adds new dimensions to music-making by allowing you to freely experiment with known alternate tunings as well as save custom alternate tunings that you find yourself.\nRoadie got its start on Kickstarter thanks to the tremendous support of our backers.

The company was founded by Hassane Slaibi and Bassam Jalgha. They decided to combine their passions for music and tech by developing the company\u2019s first product, Roadie Tuner, in 2013. Roadie garnered worldwide attention and accolades including the TechCrunch Disrupt 2014 Audience Choice Award.

You're invited to press play on this beautiful, immersive track from the Banner Saga soundtrack, and let it bring you into the world while you browse the page.\n \nWHAT\u2019S THIS THEY SAY?  \n\u201cFrom epic backgrounds to hand-drawn animation, it\u2019s one of the most beautiful game series on the planet.\u201d - Kotaku \n\u201cThe Banner Saga franchise feels like a nerd\u2019s dream. Essentially the marriage between Game of Thrones, XCOM and Oregon Trail.\u201d - Hardcore Gamer \n\u201c...a stunningly beautiful and uber entertaining RPG/adventure experience. Artistic values are through the roof, likewise the game mechanics that are perfectly crafted to offer interesting choices and great tactical entertainment.\u201d - Eurogamer\n\u201cThe combination of gameplay, character building, strategy, and narrative highlights the power games have in telling stories, and that experience is uniquely Banner Saga.\u201d - Polygon\n    WHAT\u2019S ALL THIS ABOUT MORE BANNERS AND SAGAS?  \nBanner Saga 3 is the highly anticipated final game of an award winning trilogy. It's a role-playing game merged with turn-based strategy, wrapped into an adventure mini-series about Vikings.  \nMany modern games play it safe \u2013 you are the chosen one who always saves the day. Our game is different, you can\u2019t take anything for granted in Banner Saga.\n\nPicture the classic tactical strategy games of your childhood but refined for the modern age. It's not about grinding to get past the next fight. Every encounter, every decision you make has heavy and sometimes far-reaching consequences. It throws you into the end of the world and asks,\"how do you deal with this\"?  \nBanner Saga 3 is aimed at people who appreciate art, story and strategy.\nBattles in Banner Saga are turn-based, harkening back to the classic \"Tactics\" days of gaming. The combat is straight-forward and easy to learn, but after a few battles you'll realize the game's simplicity hides a vast tactical depth. Each turn is an engrossing challenge for even the most seasoned tactician.   \nBuild your party from a roster of over 40 unique characters, each with different abilities that interact in varying ways. Each unit has a combat style all their own, but it\u2019s how they work together that counts and a well-chosen roster will equal more than the sum of its parts.\nBanner Saga combat has a classic turn-based gameplay, with a strong emphasis on tactics over brute force and endless grinding. \nBanner Saga draws heavily from Norse culture and mythology while creating its own identity. There is a low-fantasy approach to Viking themes. Giants - yes. Horned helmets - no.  \nThe choices you make as events unfold have a huge effect on how the story plays out - who survives, who dies, and what's worth saving. Add people to your caravan as you travel, or lose them when tough decisions arise. You're not just fighting to save nameless strangers, you're fighting for your neighbors, your family and your way of life. You\u2019ll care what happens to them.  \nBanner Saga 3 is a mature story for adults, which means forming relationships and making tough decisions; not sex, violence and swearing.\nTravel through stunning landscapes that evoke films from the golden age of animation. Sweeping vistas straight out of a Norse saga will accompany an emerging storyline and pin the imagination squarely in the realm of a Wagnerian Opera. \nThe Darkness plays a major role in Banner Saga 3 and your exploration of it will be unlike anything you have experienced in the previous sagas. Interact with the vast city of Arberrang and travel its streets. The gods may be dead, but their godstones and their world, remain full of wonder.  \nEvery scene in the game is painstakingly hand painted with the intent of transporting you into a bleak yet beautiful world.\nAs the heroes gain experience in battle you can modify their stats, gain extra abilities, equip mystical items, choose Heroic Titles and more!    \nIndividually, heroes can be strong, but as the game evolves you\u2019ll devise new strategies on how they work as a warband. Playing off each other's strengths will turn what seems like a rout into a great victory. In camp, rebalance each hero to fit your evolving team dynamic.\nMost combat animations are done using rotoscoped, frame-by-frame video shot in Arnie\u2019s front yard. Each \u2018hit animation\u2019 may take 20 to 30 shots to get right and each \u2018death animation\u2019... well, pummeling the heck out of each other to make every action in the game look authentic. Our friends at Powerhouse Animation then take all the raw footage and add even more drama to the action. The cinemas are all done in 2D and drawn by hand using good old-fashioned traditional animation techniques. It all comes together to give the effect of playing a film from the golden age of animation. \nWe started this game old-school and, by Dundr\u2019s beard, we\u2019ll end it old-school.\nOKAY, TELL ME SOMETHING I DON\u2019T KNOW \nBanner Saga 1 threw you into a deep, strange world where the gods were dead. The sun had stopped. A colossal serpent leveled mountains, searching for answers hidden in an ancient language as darkness roiled on the horizon. You guided your flock against overwhelming odds, to protect the ones you loved. How did you fare as the world began its end?  \nBanner Saga 2 remembered your deeds, both wise and foolish. Calamity tested your leadership. Friends became enemies and enemies, allies. You walked in deep places, and glimpsed places deeper still. Always one more hill to crest. Did you endure to the great city of Arberrang? Were you welcomed or feared within its black wall while the world outside was breaking?  \nBanner Saga 3 concludes the tale. Steel your nerves, step forth into the approaching abyss. Cross the threshold from daylight without end into untold darkness. Warped lands within threaten your sanity, and a writhing wyrm tests your mettle. But here, in the darkness, is where secrets are brought to light and motives are made clear. Are your friends who they claim to be? They all look to you. What story will your banner tell?\n    BEHOLD, THE LOOT  \nA sincere \u201cThank You\u201d for the support of this project, we really hope you enjoy the rewards! Scroll down to see everything we have to offer and please visit our Kickstarter FAQ below for more details.\n                           WHO ARE YOU, TO PROMISE SUCH THINGS AGAIN?\n    LET'S DO THIS RIGHT     \nMaking games is an intricate business, and we take it very seriously. Stoic formed in 2012 with the launch of the Kickstarter for Banner Saga, and a humble ask of $100,000. We were blown away by the response and support of the community who raised more than $700,000! That first Kickstarter campaign helped us launch the game, develop and launch the sequel, and accrue many awards in the process. Putting all the money we raised back into the development of the game raised the bar higher than we could have managed on our own.  \nNow we\u2019re back, in a similar position as before, hoping you\u2019ll support Banner Saga 3 to make this game just as special. We\u2019re still solidly indie, not accepting any investor funding so Kickstarter is still a great way to rally the community to show support for the game, while letting us call the shots on the games we make. We\u2019re paying for most of the game ourselves, but the funds we\u2019re asking for will enable us to take the time we need and bring the band back together one more time!\nEveryone that has played Banner Saga knows how important the score is to the emotion and mood of the game. This world renowned composer has been with us from the start and will be with us to the end, but he\u2019s fighting battles to make our current budget work. Let's give him the means to make it everything he knows it should be!  \nThis animation crew is truly the power behind the cinematic look of Banner Saga, we could not do this without them. How many new heroes, new boss enemies and new cut-scenes can we add for Banner Saga 3? A lot more with your help. \nDuring the first Kickstarter we recieved a long letter from this award winning sound design studio explaining these crazy wonderful ideas they had for such things as the flapping of a banner during travel scenes. We knew you needed them, now they need you. New sounds mean new experiences for the player, but new sounds need funding.\nWhere do you go to find voices that sound like Vikings? You go to Iceland. They thought we were crazy when we approached them to do a video game, but here we are 5 years later and these vikings have become our trusted allies. Please help us bring them back...or you\u2019ll have John\u2019s southern drawl to contend with.\nWe began the saga with a clear vision of where it would go, and it has become something far better than that. We have the utmost confidence that, with your help, we can bring it all together for a conclusion both profound and rewarding.\nWill you lend us your axe?\nWe\u2019re going to make every effort to produce a game for you that's deep, meaningful and makes us proud. Feel free to check out the latest Saga news by signing up for our Newsletter, keep in touch with us at www.bannersaga.com, follow us on Twitter, and Like us on Facebook.\nAlso, a huge appreciative thanks to our families and friends for putting up with, and even supporting, this insane multi-year endeavor. We love you and will come to dinner soon.\nImportant note about shipping\nShipping will be charged after the campaign ends, at the time of fulfillment and is not included in the pledge amount. Please be prepared to pay shipping costs when we verify your address right before we send out the rewards. This is done so we do not over- or under-charge, as shipping costs fluctuate over time.

Classic Metroidvania elements such as backtracking, secrets and unlocking new abilities that open new regions are at the core of the exploration experience.\nFight.\nConfront hordes of dynamically spawned eldritch monsters. Put your skills and reflexes to the test through furious melee combat and epic boss fights against uniquely designed enemies. All monster spawns are dynamic, constantly keeping you on your toes.\nDie.\nDesigned as a challenging adventure for seasoned gamers, frequent deaths are part of the Sundered experience. But taking our inspiration from our favorite rogue-like games, death in Sundered is only the beginning.\nUpgrade.\nWhen you die, you respawn in the Hub, where you level up and customize your character. Equip and upgrade a host of unique Perks, stats and special Abilities hidden throughout the world.\nAll the skills!\n  We announced the game with our marketing partner, Sony, at the end of September 2016:\nThe trailer received wide-spread praise and showed that there was definite interest for the game!\n  Sundered simply wouldn\u2019t be a Thunder Lotus game if we didn\u2019t have larger-than-life boss fights. There are six massive boss fights in the game, each providing epic confrontations that truly test your mastery of the game.\nWakey, wakey!\n  Sundered\u2019s tag line, \"Resist or Embrace\" is key to the experience. The Metroid-style abilities you find in the Shrines can be corrupted, but at a cost.\nSmash attack > Corrupted smash attack!\nAfter defeating a boss, you receive an Elder Shard. You can choose to bring this special relic to a Skill Shrine on the world to corrupt a specific Ability. A Corrupted Ability is a much more powerful version of the same gameplay mechanic, but it comes at a cost to your humanity.  \nThe tragedy of Eshe's gradual, voluntary corruption is eloquently illustrated in our second trailer, Embrace:\nThere are seven major abilities in the game, each corruptible into a more powerful eldritch version:  \nShield \nDouble Jump \nGun \nDash \nSmash \nHook Shot \nWall Run \nUltimately, corrupting your abilities has important gameplay repercussions and even changes the game's ending, as how corrupted you are defines which boss you'll face.\nSundered tells the story of the mysterious Terror, a cataclysmic event that causes the undoing of society and plunges the world into madness. You play Eshe, a scavenger who becomes trapped in a strange sandstorm which drags her into a mysterious cavern. You have stumbled upon the source of power that led to the world\u2019s destruction centuries ago. \nA derelict shrine hides massive power.\nThe backstory tells the tale of how this strange power attracted the Valkyries, an armed group of scientific revolutionaries, and the Eschaton, mad cultists following the teachings of an obscure god, to this place. As she picks up the pieces, the player uncovers the conflict that sundered the world. \nThe choice is yours...\n  We want the monsters in Sundered to be unpredictable, for you to feel like madness is just around the corner. To achieve this, all the monster spawns are dynamic.\nSlashing through a horde.\nLike in Left 4 Dead, the monsters spawn based on a number of factors (time, difficulty level, current region). This creates hordes of eldritch horrors that lurk within the shadows, waiting for the player to fall into their trap.\nRun, Eshe, Run!\n  When we announced Sundered, many players argued that a Metroidvania could not be procedural. We respectfully disagree. Though the overall structure of the world is set in stone, sub-sections (the green and grey squares on the map below) are procedurally generated every time you die. This allows us to make design choices which are core to a Metroidvania experience, like backtracking and unlocking new abilities that unlock new sub-sections, while keeping the experience fresh.\nThe structure of the world stays the same. Purple, red and blue rooms are always there.\nSub-sections in action:\nThis adds a multiplicative layer of uncertainty, since the layer of randomness of the dungeon gets added over the random monster spawns. The final game will have three unique regions, each with a multitude of monsters, secrets and challenges.\nSundered builds on Jotun's foundation and maximizes our team\u2019s visual talent through our signature hand-drawn art style, creative characters and impressive vistas. \n  A selection of concept sketches\n  As with our previous game, immersion is key to the experience and having an original soundtrack composed by Max LL is essential to the player experience.\nFor sound design, we'll be working with the amazing Pixel Audio team who worked with us on Jotun.\n  Back in 2014, with the generous help of many friends, we put together a Kickstarter campaign with very few resources. And thanks to our amazing backers, we were able to make a great game: Jotun. \nOur award winning hand-drawn Viking game!\nJotun was a critical and commercial success. We are proud to say we released Jotun on time and on budget, while still releasing an award-winning game. We learned so much during the process and are already applying it to Sundered!\n  We\u2019ve come to Kickstarter to put the game in your hands and make it the best it can be. We know how important feedback is and Jotun\u2019s alpha and beta backers transformed the game into something special. We need you to tell us what we can do better. It's about polish, feedback and using Kickstarter funds to make Sundered the best it can be.\nHere is a sampling of things we want to improve with your help:\nOverall balancing and pacing\nSpecial nodes for the Skill Tree\nDifferent ideas for Perks\nWhat exactly defines the core gameplay experience and how we can improve it\nThis also explains why anyone backing at the $15 or higher tier will get an automatic invite to Sundered's Beta. Yes, we want your feedback, but we also need the money for development time to implement that feedback. The July release date reflects this extended timeline.\nWe've been hard at work on Sundered for just over a year. All the money we raise during Kickstarter will be invested in the game's production, which will allow us to extend the game's production until June, for a July release.\nSundered's total development budget is $700,000 CAD, coming from Jotun revenues and a loan from the Canadian Media Fund (the same entity who helped fund Jotun). Sony is acting as our marketing partner (which explains why we are only releasing on PC and PS4 for now), but is not funding the game.\nHere is how we're breaking down the months until release:\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDelays are one of the biggest issues in game development. Bringing so many different aspects together in an innovative product necessarily brings its own set of challenges. With Sundered, the complexity and amount of systems we're bringing together can cause our heads to spin, requiring a ton of balancing and polish. The amount of feedback we get from you guys can also impact our timeline, as we want to make sure that our backers are happy with the game before we ship it to the masses.\n\nThis leads into the other major risk: game quality. Most people making a game are trying their best to make a great game. No one enters this industry while thinking \"Let's make some very average games that not too many people will like\". There is always the risk that the game doesn't turn out as good as you hoped it would. However, we are 100% focused on delivering an amazing gameplay experience, building on what worked and didn't work with Jotun. We also believe that with your help in alpha and beta, we'll be able to mitigate most design/fun issues and polish the game until it is great.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 1 or more", "title": "Sundered Advocate", "descp": "The heartfelt gratitude we feel towards our more frugal well-wishers will shine through every lovingly crafted pixel of their exclusive Sundered digital wallpaper!\nINCLUDES:\nOur heartfelt thanks!\nKickstarter-Exclusive Digital Wallpaper", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2017"}], "stat": ["100 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge CA$ 20 or more", "title": "Sundered Core", "descp": "A digital copy of Sundered on Steam, PS4, or GOG (Windows, Mac or Linux), plus access to the exclusive beta test version of the game!\nINCLUDES:\nSundered Digital Copy (Steam, PS4 or GOG)\nClosed Beta access\nAll previous rewards", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2017"}], "stat": ["2,190 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge CA$ 30 or more", "title": "Corrupted Core", "descp": "Enjoy Sundered's haunting digital soundtrack!

See this update on Kickstarter for details on the stretch goal and a new feature called Safe Replies.\nHi, my name is Manton Reece, and I\u2019m writing a book called Indie Microblogging. I'm also launching a brand new platform for microblogs.\nDo you remember how the web used to work? How the web was supposed to work?\nIn the earlier days of the web, we always published to our own web site. If you weren\u2019t happy with your web host, or they went out of business, you could move your files and your domain name, and nothing would break.\nToday, most writing instead goes into a small number of centralized social networking sites, where you can\u2019t move your content, advertisements and fake news are everywhere, and if one of these sites fails, your content disappears from the internet. Too many sites have gone away and taken our posts and photos with them.\nI want to encourage more independent writing. To do that, we need better tools that embrace microblogs and the advantages of the open web. We need to learn from the success and user experience of social networking, but applied to the full scope of the web.\nI first set out to build a new service just for microblogs. It has a timeline experience like a social network, with replies and favorites, but it\u2019s based on RSS, with the main posts pulled from independent sites.\nIf you don\u2019t have a microblog yet, there\u2019s a full publishing interface with Markdown support and a native iPhone app. I call it Micro.blog.\nThe second thing I\u2019m doing is writing a book and I\u2019d love your support for it on Kickstarter. This short book will make the case for microblogging and show you how to participate in the growing community of writers who own even their short-form writing.\nSome of the topics:\nHow to adapt blogging tools like WordPress and Tumblr to work with microblogs.\nThe important role of cross-posting to Twitter, and the best tools out there.\nTips for integrating your microblog into an existing full weblog.\nThe architecture for microblogs, with a behind-the-scenes look at how I built Micro.blog.\nOverview of the latest IndieWebCamp and W3C proposals for indie microblogging, such as Webmention and Micropub.\nPlus my own personal stories on why it matters so much to preserve our content on the internet.\nYou\u2019ll get the book itself and early access to Micro.blog so you can reserve your username. Whenever the Kickstarter project is successfully funded, I'll start sending out invites to backers.\nI love real books, too, so I\u2019m even doing a limited run of print copies of the book in addition to the standard e-book. There are also rewards with Micro.blog stickers and more.\nOver the last couple years, I've posted dozens of articles to my blog about independent microblogging and the open web. Some of them have even inspired others to write more on their own site. I'll be going through all of these posts to take the best writing \u2014 as well as brand new essays and technical topics \u2014 to put together this book. I'm putting everything I have into it.\nThere's a growing community and movement around independent microblogging. With your support, we can take back the future of the web from closed platforms and silos, and leave our own mark on the web. Thank you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWriting a book \u2014 even a short one like Indie Microblogging \u2014 is a lot of work.

More than just a coffee maker, it\u2019s going to be an integral part of your new lifestyle. Designed with equal elements of function and form, the Arctic is sleek, elegant, and makes amazing tasting cold brew. It\u2019s simple to use, so you can easily add it into your everyday coffee routine - no professional barista experience necessary. Great coffee awaits.\nThe best-kept secret in the coffee world has been brewing for centuries. Cold brew coffee was invented in Japan during the 1600s, recently popularized by upscale coffee shops, and perfected for making at home with the Arctic.\nIf you haven\u2019t tried cold brew yet, you\u2019re missing out. The flavor is delightfully smooth compared to the taste of your usual cup, and it packs more than enough of a caffeinated kick to get you going in the morning. \nSkip your morning trip to the coffee shop and save time and money during your morning routine.\nEverything we\u2019ve learned about cold brew coffee has been put into the Arctic. After discovering something so great, we couldn\u2019t help but share it.\nYou don\u2019t need to be a professional barista to make your own cold brew. The Arctic is specifically designed to make brewing easy at home.\nSo what is cold brew? It\u2019s a way of brewing coffee in cold water rather than the traditional method of using hot water. Cold brew has a longer extraction process which gives it a few advantages over your typical cup of coffee. For one, it tastes a lot smoother. The familiar bite of hot brewed coffee is caused by fatty acids, which are left behind during the cold brewing process. This means it\u2019s not only easier on your taste buds but on your stomach as well.\nAfter brewing coffee grounds in cold water for a set amount of time (more on the ideal schedule later) you\u2019re left with a tasty cold brew.\nYour brew can be used as a base for many different drinks: hot, cold, iced, or in a shake! The versatility of cold brew is a true game-changer in how you consume your daily dose of coffee.\nPlus, with the Arctic, you can brew up an entire batch of cold brew at once to store in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. \nThere are a million reasons to love cold brew coffee made by the Arctic. But for starters, here are the main benefits we think you should know about:\n                                                                                The Arctic is incredibly easy to use. Here's our preferred cold brew method to get you started.\nRemember, you\u2019re in control of the brewing process from start to finish! If you prefer stronger coffee, simply add more coffee grounds, use less water, or increase your brew time. The beans you choose will also determine how your brew turns out, so experiment to find out what makes your favorite coffee. \n As part of your daily life, we knew the Arctic had to be designed with equal elements of function and form. What we came up with was something sleek, and simple to use, so you can easily add it into your everyday coffee routine.\nThe carafe is made of 100% borosilicate glass and has a capacity of 50.7 oz (1.5L) to hold enough cold brew for 1-2 weeks. The Micron Filter is laser cut with tiny holes, 200 microns in diameter, to keep coffee grounds from leeching into your brew. Each feature was chosen to enhance the entire coffee-making process, from the simplicity of brewing to enjoying the smooth taste in every cup. \nYour favorite cup of coffee should be as unique as you are. The choice is yours in how little or how much you want to customize! If you\u2019re someone who is very particular about your coffee, you\u2019re going to love making cold brew with the Arctic. From fine-tuning the brewing process itself to choosing which beverage to make with your finished cold brew, the Arctic makes it easy to experiment and find out what works best for you. The possibilities are nearly endless with the Arctic.\nOne of the great benefits of the Arctic is how customizable each brew can be. For all you coffee connoisseurs out there, you\u2019re able to control not just the bean type or roast level, but also the brew time and water-to-coffee ratio. This affects the taste, aroma, and caffeine level, so you\u2019re in complete control to adjust these levels to your liking and make your ideal brew each time. If you prefer to keep things simple, find out what works for you and stick to it.\n  If you prefer stronger coffee, simply add more coffee grounds, use less water, or increase your brew time. The beans you choose will also determine how your brew turns out, so experiment to find out what makes your favorite coffee.\nOnce you\u2019ve made a batch of cold brew with the Arctic, you can use it as a base in a variety of coffee beverages. Not only can you serve it as hot coffee, over ice, or with cream or milk, but there are also plenty of ways to think outside the mug. Try it in a smoothie or milkshake, over ice cream, mixed with your favorite spirit, or even use it to bake with! Any coffee lover will surely have no shortage of creative ways to incorporate cold brew into drinks and desserts. Here\u2019s a few of our favorite recipes:\nThe journey for developing the Arctic was a process that was driven by our love and passion for coffee. And, of course, it was fuelled by coffee, too. Our goal was simple: bring to life an awesome cold brew system we would be proud to use ourselves and share with our friends. We envisioned it would be functional and an attractive conversation piece. Take a closer look at our journey with the Arctic!\nThe Arctic isn\u2019t just a coffee maker\u2014it\u2019s going to be an integral part of your new lifestyle. If you\u2019re like us, you need coffee in the morning and it needs to be well-made. Cold brew made with the Arctic simply tastes better than regular coffee: it\u2019s smoother, more flavorful, and has less bite. The Arctic can save you money by avoiding those daily trips to the coffee shop, and save you time by brewing big batches at once that can last up to 2 weeks.  \nYou\u2019re going to love the versatility that the Arctic provides, which lets you adjust both the brewing process and your beverage of choice as well. Say hello to hot coffee, iced coffee, shakes, and anything else your imagination can dream up for cold brew. Best of all, the Arctic itself is a prime example of when beautiful design is masterfully executed. Because when all your guests compliment you on serving them the best coffee they\u2019ve ever had, you\u2019ll be proud to show them the Arctic.                                         \nYour pledge will not only help us bring the Arctic to life, it will help us build our brand and take our business to the next level. We thank you for believing in us.\nJoin the movement now and make a pledge to get your very own Arctic. Great coffee awaits.\nAs of December 5th 2016, we successfully reached our $75,000 stretch goal. A huge thanks to all of our backers for your support.

As we are shipping these products all over the world, it is impossible for us to build in the various duties, VAT and GST tax for each location through Kickstarter.\nShipments that could not be delivered due to an inaccurately provided address (including failure to update an old address) will have additional costs to be reshipped. Due to the size of your rewards, we cannot ship to PO Boxes.\nEstimated Delivery: Once production is complete on all of the orders, we will provide updates for shipping dates. As you know with international shipping there can be unpredictable delays that are out of our control, however, we will do our absolute best to ship based on the predicted time frame.\nOur team is made up of friends and colleagues, all of which have one major thing in common: we\u2019re 90% powered by caffeine. Which is why we thought it was so fitting to collectively put our energy into making an amazing home coffee system.\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot from day one on our long journey of developing the Arctic. We\u2019re proud to share our creation with the world and appreciate all the interest that we\u2019ve been shown by our supporters.\nBecause no matter how we spend our days, we all start them the same.

I'll collect this info in the survey (sorry USA address only for this option)\nWhat can The Weatherneck System do for you:\n  Mullet Hat + Face Mask = The Weatherneck System\nDesigned strictly for purpose:\nRemoves with one-hand in one-second \u2013 powerful neodymium magnets make the system secure but quickly removable\nSize adjustable \u2013 Three metal tabs stitched into the back of the hat allow for small, medium and large sizing options\nBreath in and out at any pace \u2013 a mesh center section gives protection where you want and ventilation when you need it  \nExcellent coverage, where it matters most - your ears, face and neck\nRUNNER?\nPLAY\n\nQuick running review now that its cold out!\nMullet?\nClearly the mulleted among us are on to something!\nMy problem; solved.\nFor me, the idea of stopping and wrestling a piece of fabric over my head/helmet was not attractive. So unattractive in fact, that I didn\u2019t bother starting with a neck/face mask even though I really wanted to be wearing one. Sometimes you just don't have the chance to stop and adjust clothing. Now you can have the best of both worlds by backing this campaign right now. \nConstructed from highly technical, USA made, fabrics with a unique mesh design that reduces fogging and keeps you warm, without bulk, by wicking moisture from your skin. The Weatherneck System is professionally sewn in Milwaukee, Wisconsin by seasoned experts.\nHigh performance without bulk\n      Loose around the neck is how I wear it about 90% of the time\nA version of this launched last season, what\u2019s different? \nThe original design was just the bandana, but after getting feedback from our backers it was clear more was needed to solve the problems. I am now absolutely convinced the two part system represents the right solution for all types of users.\nRetro compatible? Yes.\nThe original Weatherneck works perfectly with the Mullet Hat. If you have a previous face mask you just need the hat and you're good to go! \nTop 5 Improvements The Weatherneck System provides: \n1. A magnetic connection keeps the face mask high and secure \n2. Steel tabs in the hat simplify the re-sizing process\n3. The Mullet Hat completely covers the neck and ears\n4. Higher airflow mesh material massively reduces fogging \n5. The face mask is 2 inches longer allowing it to rest more comfortably and tuck in easier\nAdding 2 inches in length made a HUGE difference!\nNot always obvious. \nSurprise! We incorporated a secret hidden pocket in the Mullet Hat (thanks DJ)! It\u2019s a great place to store a hand warmer, ID, credit card or anything else you want to be your little secret. \nA secret Mullet Pocket for hand-warmers or whatever else. What will you put in there?\n100% black - I dyed the fabric black all the way through front and back. Dyed fabric performs better at wicking moisture than sublimated fabrics. Also some organizations require head gear to be uniform in color. We have complied by popular request.\nBehold all the color options!\nIt\u2019s one-size but with multiple options - The system makes resizing super simple. Using 3 settings, it fits roughly from 46cm to 61cm comfortably.\n3 steel tabs across the back of the hat allow 3 size options\nIt's safe - Do you or your team work around machinery? The Weatherneck System allows the face mask to pop right off in case it gets caught in something. You won\u2019t get choked, so there\u2019s that\u2026which is nice. \nNo Velcro - There are a few reasons I avoided it: it's loud, it screws up other gear in the wash and it fails to function when iced or dirty.\nIt's made from yoga pants material - Yes! It blocks just enough wind and provides just enough insulation to get the job done without adding bulk and it is insanely comfortable.\nCan I wash and dry it? Use the washer but I recommend air drying both pieces.\nFinally, it is a tactical advantage: \nIt\u2019s quiet (NO VELCRO) - Using magnets makes this the only tactical breakaway balaclava. Getting hot out there but you\u2019re in a noise sensitive environment? No problem. Put it on and take it off in silence. \nWho should buy The Weatherneck?\nsnow, moto, cycle and tactical (no bank robbers!)\nPlease donate a SHARE to my project even if you can't back it right now.\nREVIEWS SO FAR (added as they come in):\nthemtblab.com\nBikeRumor.com\nCyclingtips.com (about crowdfunded cycling projects in general)\nPodcast: on Cyclingtips.com\nPodcast: on Midwest Cycling Podcast\nITS Tactical (video review)\nPaceline Podcast (we're Fatty's pick this week 40 minutes in)\nPeloton Magazine\nBikeRadar\nEngearment\n  I am planning on placing the first order prior to the end of the campaign so we can start shipping BEFORE CHRISTMAS.

The fabrics are already ordered. The magnets are in hand, the steel tabs for the hat are easily obtainable from numerous suppliers. My sewing supplier is more than up for the challenge and all our design changes are behind us.\n\nI do have 1 alternative sewing resource if the current supplier has issues. My supplier makes product in Milwaukee for some very large brands. My project doesn't appear to be too challenging for them.\n\nI'll take no chances on quality. I'll be performing spot inspections as production starts and my cut/sew vendor is committing to a regular QA process themselves. I believe the product is in great shape. I'm further along than any of my previous campaigns and all those delivered on time. But products can always be improved. What would you do differently? Pledge to back the project then let me know your thoughts (comments are welcome).\n\nI am planning on making my first order prior to the end of the campaign so we can start shipping BEFORE CHRISTMAS.\n\nRegarding INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING - The fee I collect is only for shipping, it does NOT cover ANY taxes or fees charged by your country. Please re-read that if you're confused.\n\nA word on magnets...\n\nNeodymium magnets are STRONG. These are sewn in place, but they can escape. If that happens throw dispose of them immediately.\n\nLearn more about magnets here: http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5548a3.htm\n\nThe magnetic fields of these Neodymium magnets can effect pace-makers or other bodily implants, don't use if you have metal plates in your head or a pacemaker. They don't effect cell phones and are unlikely to effect credit cards.\n\nChildren should not be allowed to handle magnets as they can be VERY dangerous if they escape the seams.\n\nCan magnets wreck your credit card? Uh, not likely... http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/video-magnets-make-credit-card-mag-stripe-not-work-1457.php\n\nFinally, I'd like to point out that once again I have committed to providing you with only the finest chi enhancing magnets on earth.

Those are 5 of the regular spoon sizes pictured against 8 of ours :)\nWith Polygons, you are able to find the size you need in seconds, without searching through all of your drawers. Plus, the spoon lays completely flat until you need to use it.\nWhen designing Polygons, we wanted to focus on making our product not only durable but also better for the environment than traditional measuring spoons.  \nThe hinges of Polygons are made of TPR, which have the property of being able to flex a 100,000 cycles without failure.\n(Edit: Many of you have messaged us asking for a 10 year warranty card... The life of such a composite plastic product depends on a variety of factors such as usage patterns, abrasion, temperature, humidity, product abuse, etc, other than just the number of times it\u2019s hinges can flex\nThe product may not live till 10 years, or it might even probably far surpass it\nIt would be like determining the lifespan of a person based on how well his/her joints function)\nAdditionally, with the 4-in-1 design, Polygons eliminates the need for excess plastic and metals that traditional measuring spoons use.\nThe materials we use to create Polygons ensure all ingredients fall off the spoon with little effort. They ensure that the ingredients you use do not stain or stink up your Polygons measuring spoons.\n\n(The images showing the folded spoon resting in place without being held by a hand, are staged photographs... But we see that people want some facility to be able to hold the shape in place without having to hold it, and we're working on it! - covered in the November 17th update)\n A sneak peek of our early prototyping processes \nNumerous configurations & geometries were tested using paper during the ideation stage, then manually tested with a variety of materials\n3D volumetric determination & construction \nWe tested several manufacturing methods to see which one would be optimal for a product of this nature\nShown in this video is one of these early methods, with very basic tooling without any fineness\nPictured in the campaign video is a prototype with similar functioning to the production version -\n (thickness & features exaggerated for explanation)\nThe production version has a similar appearance from the top, and the hinges slightly wider at the bottom, for the softer, flexible TPR to have surface area for a robust bonding\nThis is what gives the product an almost flat, easy-to clean surface both at the top and bottom\n\nWe haven\u2019t pictured the nitty-gritties and manufacturing technique of the production version in more excruciating detail to protect our IP, exactly due to instances like these, which we\u2019ve been citing as a concern early on:\nhttps://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/new-design-cheap-Polygons-The-Flat_60551273844.html\n\nApparently, what you\u2019ve pledge $10+ for, is available for 1/100th the price \nOr is it? The particular seller has listed other popular products on Kickstarter as well, stealing the same images \nYou place a bulk advance order, and then never receive anything (we tried it out with this guy)\n\nPolygons was created in 2014 by Rahul Agarwal. An India native, Agarwal is an inventor, designer and teacher.\nHe's worked on products ranging from the simplest of stationery to complex, head-up display systems.\nA few years ago, as a design student at a renowned Indian university, he was given this advice by a senior \u2013 \u201cDo not tackle designs that have reached the final stage of their evolution. For example, a spoon.\u201d From that point on, Agarwal dedicated his efforts to reinventing the wheel when it came to this object, and the idea for Polygons was born. After extensively testing with various shapes and materials, he arrived at an optimal geometry.\nOver the past couple years, Polygons has won various design awards and thousands have expressed interest in the invention. For the inventor in Agarwal, there could be no greater satisfaction than to see people using what he had created, so he got to task.\nPlease help us spread the word :)\nThe larger the Polygons community, the better it'll help us make the best kitchen gadget ever!\n A big BIG shoutout to Tali, for the delicious photographs\nhttp://www.talidovrat.com\n\nAnd the friends, family, loved ones and kind strangers who've helped us make this happen :)\n\nAnd also...\n...", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf you like the product, the only risk you're bearing is that of missing out on a true piece of delight by not backing it!\nNo but seriously, as with any new project, there are always some risks associated with manufacturing and supply chain logistics.

Anything. Simply.\nHave you ever dreamed of controlling everything in your home with a single remote? Well now you can! Smart Remote is a revolutionary product that lets you instantly control any device\u2014TVs, media players, speakers, lights, thermostats and more. Just point at what you want to control and Smart Remote\u2019s screen automatically adapts\u2014like magic.\n   When you point at any device, Smart Remote\u2019s high-definition touchscreen will instantly display an intuitive interface to control that specific device.\nWelcome to a world you can easily control. This goes way beyond your TV and media players.\nIf you want to control a device that is located near other ones\u2014like a media player below your TV or maybe a light next to your speaker\u2014Smart Remote lets you easily select which one you want to control. Just use the device selection carousel that automatically appears at the top of the remote.\nYou can also control devices located in other areas of your house. For example, you could point at your living room fireplace to control the thermostat in your hallway or point in the direction of your garage door to make sure you remembered to close it. \n    They Love Us\n  The Only Remote You'll Ever Need\nSmart Remote gives you the ability to control any device via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or Infrared. It\u2019s compatible with more than 25,000 devices, and we\u2019re adding new devices & services every day.

For the first time in history, we\u2019ve integrated a precise indoor positioning system in a consumer electronic device. This breakthrough technology gives Smart Remote the ability to control tens of thousands of devices in a simple and intuitive way. Our patent-pending technology combines this indoor positioning system with 9-axis motion sensors to track Smart Remote\u2019s exact position and orientation. This enables Smart Remote to know what it\u2019s pointing at in 3D space. \n     Control Your Entire Home\n  Smart Remote users will have several options for controlling all the devices in their home.\n1) Control Wi-Fi Devices In Other Rooms \nSmart Remote gives you the ability to control any Wi-Fi connected device on the same wireless network as Smart Remote, even if those devices are located in areas of your home other than where you installed your room sensors (aka your Smart Zone). All you need to do is set locations in your living room to point and control devices in other rooms. For example, you could set up Smart Remote to point at your fireplace to control the thermostat in your hallway, or you could point in the direction of your entry way or dining room to control the lighting in those rooms from your couch.\n2) Install Smart Remote in Multiple Rooms \nIf you\u2019d like to have a Smart Remote in more than one room, you can purchase and install as many Smart Remote kits as you like\u2014living room, bedroom, office, kitchen, man cave, wherever. Each Smart Remote you purchase will only work in one Smart Zone, but fear not, your Smart Remote experience will continue to grow and get better with time. Read on.\n3) Install New Smart Zones \nBy the end of 2017, we will provide an option to purchase additional room sensor kits to create new Smart Zones and expand use of the Smart Remotes you already own. We will also release a free software update that lets you use any Smart Remote you own in any Smart Zone in your house, not just the Smart Zone in which it was originally installed.\n4) Use Smart Remote in Extended (Non-Smart) Zones \nWe launched Smart Remote on Kickstarter because we need your feedback and support to make this an exceptional product that you\u2019ll enjoy using everyday. After receiving hundreds of comments and suggestions and lots of great input, we\u2019re excited to announce our first community-driven feature\u2014Extended Mode. When you take Smart Remote outside of its Smart Zone and carry it to other areas of your home, Smart Remote will automatically display all your devices and services in a selection carousel. You will be able to select and control any Wi-Fi device on the same network as Smart Remote, any Bluetooth device within range that Smart Remote is connected with, and any infrared device you point at after selecting it in the carousel. Every home environment is unique, so your Smart Zone(s) may actually extend beyond the room or rooms where you installed sensors.\nInstantly Access Your Favorite Services\nFor the first time ever, you can turn on your TV, dim the lights, control your Thermostat, check Weather and order an Uber in less time than it took you to read this sentence. This is what makes Smart Remote so unique. Just choose a location for every service you want to add\u2014like your front door for Uber or your window for weather\u2014and simply point toward each location to get instant access.\n  Never Lose It\nLike you, we hate when we lose things. That\u2019s why we\u2019re fighting back against couch cushions, evil gnomes, mischievous children and general absent-mindedness. If there ever comes a time when you can\u2019t find your Smart Remote, just press the lost and found button on the charging base to make it ring.\n  Make It Yours\nSmart Remote has lots of cool features to make your connected home experience more convenient and enjoyable.\nGroup your lights together\nDo you want to control all your living room lights at the same time? Or maybe specific groupings of lights? No problem! Just open up the Smart Remote app and create custom light groups. It lets you turn on/off, dim or change the color of multiple lights\u2014all at once. When you point at any light in a group, you can use the selection carousel to either control the entire group or just control the individual light you are pointing at.\nCreate custom scenes\nSmart Remote gives you the power to set the mood and control multiple devices at once. Want a little romance in the air? Then bring the lights down low and turn on some music with a single tap. Is it movie night? Then choose your movie scene to fire up your TV and media player and adjust all your lights to the color and brightness you prefer.\n  What's In The Box\nEach Smart Remote kit comes with a Smart Remote, charging base and 3 room sensors.\n  Simple Setup\nIt only takes a couple minutes to get Smart Remote up and running:\nDownload the free Sevenhugs Smart Remote app (iOS or Android) \nInstall sensors in the room where you\u2019d like to use Smart Remote, in line of sight with each other. For best performance, place them at least 7ft (2m) high on different walls and as far apart as possible. \nAdd devices and services using the app and designate a location in your room for each device or service using Smart Remote \nEnjoy :)\nThe 3 room sensors can cover a room up to 1,000 sqft (100m2) in size and are also paintable.\n Smart Remote is available for iOS and Android.\n  To Infinity And Beyond \nWith our open API and SDK, the possibilities for developers are endless.\nLevel 1 \u2014 Add New Devices (Available June 2017) \nReuse existing UI and implement functions to control new connected devices. Our open API/SDK is made in Lua and based in C/C++ and lets you easily add new devices. Developers have access to communication interfaces (Wi-Fi, BT, BLE, IR). A first version has been released here: https://github.com/sevenhugs/smart-remote-sdk\nLevel 2 \u2014 Unleash Smart Remote\u2019s Full Power (Available End of 2017) \nCreate new use cases, gestures, screens and menus. Gain access to a detailed specification interface (position and orientation, or specific events identified with the 9-axis accelerometer), and trigger specific actions and services.\n  Design and Specs\n   Rewards  \n  Stretch Goals \n     \nHow It All Started \nWe began this journey in 2014 with a mission to connect people and their homes. There are several challenges with today\u2019s smart home products: 1) They are too complicated for people to use 2) Every device comes with it\u2019s own app or remote control 3) Nothing works seamlessly together. We wanted to build a product to solve these challenges and create something so simple that anyone could enjoy a connected home.\nDesigned in collaboration with of the most iconic and decorated French Design studios, eliumstudio, Smart Remote will be the heart of every connected home. Since 2014, we\u2019ve made dozens of drawings, 3D printed prototypes and manufactured prototypes. Smart Remote made its first appearance at Techcrunch Disrupt in 2015, where we gave a live demo on stage using our first prototype in front of hundreds of journalists. A few weeks later, we showed the prototype version 2 at CES in Las Vegas in 2016.\n      Why Kickstarter\nWhen you\u2019re trying to build great product, you need the support of a passionate community. That\u2019s exactly why we\u2019re here. Your ideas and feedback are vital to our product development efforts. As we prepare to enter production, we know we can build a world-class physical touchscreen remote. Where we really need your help is understanding all of the ways you want to use it. And when you receive your very own Smart Remote, we\u2019ll be very eager to learn how we can make it better. Let\u2019s build the world\u2019s most amazing home remote together.\nOn Track To Deliver\n  Sevenhugs Family \nWe are Sevenhugs.

With stunning visuals, innovative camera mechanics and solid RPG crafting and story elements, Redlock Studios has struck a chord with this game.\"\nPhil Elliott, director of indie development, Square Enix.\n           Hi there. It looks like you're here to learn more about Shattered: Tale of the Forgotten King, and it seems like I am the perfect conduit for this. In case you are wondering, this is the astounding creature called the Whisperer, fellow citizen of Hypnos's kingdom, now talking to you.\nLet's get started. My creator, Maxime Ren\u00e9, has been working on stories around my universe for about ten years. He created lots of artwork, wrote many tales and even developed role-playing games based on that mythology. A year ago, he decided to take the ultimate step and gathered a team together - called Redlock Studio - to finally bring it all to life. And now is the time for you to help!\nI'm looking forward to meeting you all in the game, dear Wanderers...\n      Maybe he dreamt himself up, birthed from the first spark, within his own creative consciousness. Maybe something greater breathed him to life. The truth is without a doubt beyond our humble reach and stretches past all philosophical considerations. And it might be better this way. From a thought he conjured up the Void. From a glance, he made the world. And from a whisper, he created us.\nFor his kingdom, the first word came in a whisper. Before knowing what the sky, a mountain or a river was, this word echoed within our souls. From our birth to our last breath, we would serve and protect Hypnos.\nAmong countless wonders of his creation, we thought we would live and dream forever.\nThen the King left. Nobody, even among his closest subjects, happened to know where and why he was gone, nor if he was still alive. Hypnos lost its soul without a warning or an explanation. From this moment, the kingdom gradually fell into a misty limbo.\nFrom darkness and oblivion, unnatural entities entered this too-far-gone world and crushed everything that remained, shattering the realm in three separate pieces. Soon, it was nothing more than a dead land shaped in silence, ashes and shadows.\n\nThousands of years passed, or maybe just a moment. And no one remembers these lost times.\n  Without any memories of your past, now begins your quest for truth. As you march on those strange places, you'll face incredibly powerful and mythic creatures; learning about them, and your own destiny.\nWait a minute. Here are a few things you may like to know before you dive into Hypnos's fractured lands by yourself...\nEvery living thing in the world of Hypnos was born silent with a mask that defines their personality. Few came to life with a name, which could only be given by the King and defined the purpose of their existence.\nThe only ones who can talk are called Whisperers. They're nothing like other people: Whisperers wear no masks, but handle words for the silent ones.\nThe Pretorians were once part of the Royal Army. Unlike normal citizens, they abandoned their mask and name to wear the Pretorian armor and served the King until their last breath...Or, at least, until he wasn't there anymore. Now, they serve other masters...\nThe Demiurges, as they were named, are the ferocious entities that rose when Hypnos was falling. They are the last lords of the truth and mysteries of the world.\nThe story of Hypnos yet has to be discovered and the future is in your hands. Will you help the Wanderer on his journey?\n  2D PLATFORMER\nThe challenge for the player is to explore the whole, wide-ranging level, and then to solve it as a large-scale puzzle.\n Each zone is made of :\nOne major puzzle that the player has to solve to progress through the adventure.\nThree minor puzzles that will give you access to secret zones or different scenaristic nodes.\n    In this part, you must survive lethal traps, solve many enigmas and find your way through labyrinthic levels.\n3D DYNAMIC BOSS FIGHT\nThrough the game, the player will face 12 bosses, the Demiurges, and legions of the Fallen: dead creatures and citizens of the realm are now their servant and minions. There are different behaviour patterns for each one of them.\nThe fighting system is as pure as possible, relying on:\nPlayer's dexterity, reflexes and sense of timing. Light and heavy attacks, dodging, feinting and dashing are at the very heart of the gameplay and lead to special attack chains.\nSkills acquired and used during the platforming phases.\n      STORYTELLING\nThe story is narrated throughout in the following ways:\nThe Whisperer's narrative\nScrolls from the Geodesian Book, common objects in each level\nEibon fragments, hidden in some dark places.\n  Each one carries its own vision of the story. Indeed, Shattered encourages players to collect different lore elements that will tell portray differing perspectives (if not the precise opposites) about Hypnos. You'll then have to reconstruct the truth according to your interpretation of the varying stories you've uncovered.\nRPG COMPONENTS\nSKILL SYSTEM: Unlock different passive or active skills depending on how you want to play the game. Some hidden skill trees will give different skill sets, depending on the battles you fight and levels you complete.\n  CRAFTING SYSTEM: Every killed monster will drop Limbo Essences, which are the in-game currency. You can use them to heal yourself or throw them in the alchemical crucible. The crucible allows you to create several consumables, plus items to merge with your equipment in order to change your stats according to your preference. You can also improve your alchemy skills by collecting cardinal slivers.\nLANGUAGE : Every single Eibon's fragment is a letter of the alphabet. The more you have, the more you'll be able to translate the Demiurges' strange language. The player will need to understand and handle properly those elements to discover the most complete ending.\n    We had so many ideas for the rewards that it was hard to chose between all of them. Aside from the \u201cgoodies for fun and style\u201d as we like to call them, we truly wish to offer you rewards that are directly connected to the game to extend your experience: original role-playing notes, universe books, added lore fragments etc... The fact that you will to share this adventure makes us so proud and grateful that we really want to offer the best. Thanks again dear Wanderers, if it wasn't for you, this project wouldn't exist.\n        The Redlock is a mystic place, a path between the universes. It is born of a will to create an intricate and captivating world. Shattered is one of the first stones. We're a French studio based in Lyon (FR) that has attracted many artists and engineers, due to our game\u2019s special atmosphere, its graphic style and lore. Today, eight souls have joined Redlock Studio, supported by the work of a dozen other wanderers.\nOur goal with Shattered is to deliver an intense storytelling experience, with emotive scenery and epic boss fights. We work on creating an intimate world, through a complex tale. We want to tell a story in which the different endings are complementary, to bring a global vision and a message open to players' interpretation.\nAs the Redlock team grew up very fast and the feedback around the project were so encouraging, we decided to go to Kickstarter to make the exact game we were dreaming of for so long. As a matter of fact, our artistic director and scenarist have been working on the Hypnos' universe for the last seven years. It is a large, complex and fully thought-out world, which now needs your help to take foot in our reality... Our first goal of EUR 80 000 is enough to fund the game, but not to remain fully independent. That would be the necessary amount to rise external funds or find some publisher \u2013 which is already done if we finally need to. So, aside from allowing us to add ingame content, reaching higher funding levels would let us remain independent...

The easiest, most effective wine preserver there is.  Aroma and taste.   Perfectly preserved.  Enjoy every glass.\nOur Promise.  Repour works.  Every single time.  We'll never let your wine go bad - so you never have to worry about it.\nPeople Talking about Repour.\nIt's Easy. Remove a foil seal and insert our smart stopper into your wine bottle. That's it. Really. Repour is activated to absorb oxygen when you remove the foil. When you walk away, we get to work.    \n  Come back anytime and get another glass...days, weeks or even months later. Your wine will be waiting patiently for you.  As fresh as when you first opened the bottle.  Simply remove our smart stopper from your bottle, pour a glass, and re-insert the smart stopper to save the rest for another day. \nIt's Effective.  We absorb oxygen from the air above your wine.  In turn, oxygen is degassed from the wine to levels lower, way lower, than any preserving system.  Ever.  So low in fact, that your wine may need to \"open up\" again the next time you pour a glass.\nNo Oxygen.  No Wine Degradation.  No Wine Down the Drain. \n                The Idea.  Almost two years ago, trying to sleep on the couch to let my wife, Michelle, get some much needed rest while our newborn son \"slept\", I started thinking about the half bottle of wine that was just poured down the drain. Trying many of the gimmicks on the market thru the years with little success, I thought there must be a better way of getting rid of nuisance oxygen in leftover wine.  As a chemist, I thought there must be a better way.  \nI started the research and development process on this problem as I have countless times thru my career.  But this time as a fun side project to do at home. The end result of these efforts (with many failures along the way) is the Repour Smart Stopper, the easiest and most effective wine preservation tool on the market.\nYour Help. We need help.  We have a finalized design, we've proven Repour works...really well.  We know the investments required to bring this product to commercialization.\nWe just need your support to make it a reality. With meeting our fundraising goals, we can hit \"go\" and have product ready to ship no later than February 2017. \n         How do we know Oxygen is less than 0.05%....\n Long term \"shelf life\" study, started 9/16/16, picture taken 10/26/16.  (It's hard to tell, but the bottles stopped with Repour Smart Stopper have the indicator inside the bottle)\nOxygen <0.05% the indicator is PINK  \nOxygen >0.05% the indicator is PURPLE", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've done a lot of design, development, and costing work to be confident we can deliver what we say we can...timing, product performance, product MSRP!\n\nThe Repour team and our advisers have helped bring thousands of products to market thru the years.

We've also been blindsided more than once by completely unexpected issues and always dealt with them in a way that leaves every last customer happy with their purchase and proud to support our company.\n\nIn short, we know what we're doing, and you should be very confident that we will deliver what we say we will, when we say we will. And we solemnly swear that should unforeseen issues come up, we will handle them with the utmost transparency and care for you, our backers.\n\nSupply Chain Risk: We're incredibly proud of our supply chain, and have a lot of confidence that we can make what we say we'll make, when we say we'll make it. But know what? Sometimes 10 shipping containers of product get stuck outside a shipyard for 3 weeks. We pad our schedule for these kind of things, but sometimes not enough.\n\nActs of God: We're based in San Francisco. That means we could have an earthquake. Or we could have a massive spur-of-the-moment parade involving wacky costumes and public nudity. Or, god forbid, the Dodgers could come to town. Whatever happens, we'll get through it together.

The glass bead finish helps avoid condensation from causing your glass to stick to the coaster. \nWe also used a special non-slip neoprene base on the bottom to prevent your coaster from sliding around. As with all of our products, our Titanium Coasters are proudly made in the USA!\nThey're tough, durable and made for everyday use.  Whether at home, in the office or in your own workshop our Titanium Coasters are built to keep your surfaces safe while looking like they always belonged there. Being made from Titanium means they won't shatter, rust, dull or change their beautiful appearance for as long as you own them! \nDurable and Sturdy for Everyday Use\nThese Pure Titanium coasters are perfect for your workspace whether it's a desk at work, a workshop table or your garage bench.  The sleek design fits with any desk setup and keeps your surface protected from unwanted condensation.\nPerfect Coaster for Your Workspace - Protect Your Wood Desk\nWe chose 6AL-4V Grade 5 Titanium because of it's superior characteristics:\nTough:  So durable it's 4 times stronger than steel.\nLight:    This coaster set can be easily moved around your home.\nHot/Cold Resistant:  Titanium can absorb energy whether from hot or cool surfaces contacting it, meaning it won't transfer the heat from your coffee or tea into your nice table.\nCorrosion Resistant:  Titanium naturally resists corrosion and does not rust like steel.  It's ideal to withstand the wear and tear of daily use.  That's why they built aircraft engines from it.\nElegant Surface Finish:  Glass bead blasted so the surface looks flawless and will remain durable over time.\nJust Cool:  Titanium is a unique and very cool metal, we think it's neat to have everyday items made from this awesome material.\nSmooth Glass Bead Blasted Finish\nDesign\nWe chose to keep the coaster pure, and minimalist.  Everything needed, no unnecessary frills. The coaster is 3.50\" in diameter and is made from 0.100\" thick solid Grade 5 Titanium. It serves its purpose and is thick enough to be sturdy and stable, but still sleek and easy to store and does not take up valuable desk real estate. \nWe gave the bottom a non-slip neoprene rubber, which has a pattern that increases the surface contact area, allowing the coaster to grip any surface it rests on.\nTextured Neoprene Non-Slip Grip\nYou can be sure your drink won't slide around, or be pulled up from condensation.  We carefully selected this design over cork for these reasons.\nPLAY\n\nWe designed the storage rack to compliment the dark metallic hue of titanium and look great in any setting. Like the coasters, we also tried to conserve the space, for small tables.\n~~ Optional~~ Black Walnut Coaster Holder $15\nThe non-slip pads ensure the coasters stay put in the rack and the holder on the table.\n~~Optional~~ Black Walnut Coaster Holder $15\nThe hardwood storage rack can be purchased as an add on for the 4-set for $15.\nEveryday Use - Home, Garage, Work\nIn our own houses we have stemless wine glasses, stainless travel mugs, ceramic coffee mugs, tea steeping pots, beer bottles, soda cans, water glasses, nalgenes, the list goes on...\nPerfect for Any Type of Drink\nAll of these need a place to rest and having a durable coaster means protecting your furniture, countertops, and other surfaces while contributing to your decor and aesthetic.\nIn the office, we always have several drinks on the desk: coffee, water bottle, soda, drink from lunch, having a sleek coaster to compliment your workspace saves your desktop from damage and will be the envy of your office.  \nEasily Protect your Workbench\nTimeline & Delivery Date\nDeliver by Late October\nAbout Taftware\nWe are a small design and manufacturing company based in Detroit, Michigan.  We enjoy working with unique materials and bringing our ideas to life by creating useful products that everyone will enjoy.  We believe in creating and making things you care about and are committed to doing that in our home base of Detroit.\nEverything we design is made in the USA from materials sourced in the USA.\nWe've done it before, crafting whiskey tumblers from titanium, brass, copper, stainless steel and even soapstone.  We then set out to create a perfect, minimalist wine stopper that would provide a superior seal on any size wine bottle.  We have a passion for well made products designed for everyday use.  These coasters are no different.  Strong, beautiful and made in the USA from Grade 5 6AL-4V Titanium.\nGrade 5 Titanium Coasters\nThank you for viewing our project!

Easy! Because I love it! Crowdfunding is an awesome adventure. I enjoy the interaction with supporters, other cooks, bloggers, travelers, Kickstarters, and people from all over the world that love to dream, and help others with their own dreams.\nIn 2013, a small, indie publisher in Germany contacted me about being a publishing partner. I soon started working with Ventil Verlag and The Lotus and the Artichoke joined the emerging Edition Kochen ohne Knochen series of vegan & vegetarian cookbooks. It's an incredible partnership, and I enjoy working with an alternative publisher that understands the struggles and challenges for independent authors.\nBeing with a small publisher, my production costs and expenses for writing, cooking, photographing, illustrating, and designing my own cookbooks are not really covered.\nI am passionate about my projects, and know they have a value for many people. I'm here on Kickstarter to ask for your support and involvement, to help continue and evolve The Lotus and the Artichoke project.\nT-Shirts from the 2015 Kickstarter\n  Lotus MALAYSIA t-shirt design ideas\n  Lotus MALAYSIA totebag design idea\nTHE STORY of The Lotus and the Artichoke\nIn 2012, my first Kickstarter project The Lotus and the Artichoke - Vegan Cookbook was successful with the help of over 360 amazing backers from around the world. It was my first cookbook in a developing series of books featuring my personal stories, photographs, artwork, and vegan recipes inspired by my travels and culinary experiences in 40 countries.\nIn December, the first edition of The Lotus and the Artichoke - Vegan Recipes from World Adventures was printed: 1000 copies in full color, featuring over 100 recipes and more than 90 full-page, mouth-watering photographs. The Lotus and the Artichoke quickly became an international sensation.\nAfter another successful Kickstarter project in 2013, The Lotus and the Artichoke was translated and published in German \u2013 along with the second English edition.\nLater that year, I traveled to Mexico with my partner Julia and our young son Kolja, where we lived in a small town for 3 months, cooking (and surfing) with the locals. I documented our experiences and cooking adventures in my next book, The Lotus and the Artichoke - MEXICO which was published in English & German in 2014.\nThe following winter we spent 10 weeks exploring Sri Lanka. The Lotus and the Artichoke - SRI LANKA was published in 2015, following a sucessful third Kickstarter project with over 737 backers from more than 30 countries worldwide.\nI traveled around Malaysia, Singapore & Borneo for 5 weeks in early 2016 learning to cook traditional Malay, Chinese, and Indian dishes from the locals. I've spent the last six months creating all the recipes, artwork, photography & stories for the new cookbook.\nSince 2013 I have devoted almost all of my working hours to The Lotus and the Artichoke and other projects in the culinary field. In addition to writing my own cookbooks, I offer international vegan cooking classes, cooking demonstrations & shows, write recipes and do photography for other cookbooks and magazines. I also love to help others with translations, photography, design, and advice on their own projects \u2013 almost always dealing with art, travel, and food.\nCooking Show at Veganz Hamburg\n  THE TIMELINE\nSEPT 2012: My first Kickstarter project is a SUCCESS!\nDEC 2012: 1st English edition of The Lotus and the Artichoke - Vegan Recipes from World Adventures published.\nMARCH 2013: My second Kickstarter project is a SUCCESS!\nMAY 2013: 1st German edition of The Lotus and the Artichoke - Vegane Rezepte eines Weltreisenden published. 2nd English edition printed.\nOCT 2013: The Lotus and the Artichoke nominated by VEBU (German Vegetarian Association) for Best Cookbook of the Year; wins a spot in the TOP 10 COOKBOOKS of 2013!\nMARCH 2014: Return from 3 months in Mexico.\nSEPT 2014: Germany Tour with The Vegan Zombie \u2013 Cooking demos, dinner parties, cookbook signings & other events in 9 cities in 11 days. 3rd printing of The Lotus and the Artichoke in German!\nNOV 2014: The Lotus and the Artichoke - MEXICO! printed in German & English.\nMARCH 2015: Return from 10 weeks in Sri Lanka.\nSEPT 2015: My third Kickstarter project is a SUCCESS!\nNOV 2015: The Lotus and the Artichoke - SRI LANKA published in German & English\nFEB 2016: Return from 5 weeks in Malaysia, Singapore & Borneo\nMAR-SEPT 2016: Art, Cooking, Writing, Photography & Production of The Lotus and the Artichoke - MALAYSIA.\nOCT 2016: Expected publication of The Lotus and the Artichoke - MALAYSIA in German & English.\nCupcakes with Nicole Just, best selling author of La Veganista\n  Thomas D & Me!

In order for a Watch to be allowed to be branded Swiss Made, the movement and final control process must take place in Switzerland and this must be verified.\nThis magnificent watch shares its characteristic with a very few watches of renowned brands. But there is one significant difference: the Tonneau Chronographs currently offered on the market are rare and generally cost in excess of $3000 and beyond.\nA watch to be worn on any occasion and to be admired by everyone.\n     WM of Switzerland in the market and the media. They loved it .\nWM of Switzerland was established in 1980 in a small Swiss village in the Canton of Bern, close to Solothurn.\n  Originally, WM of Switzerland was just another Swiss watch-making company producing hand-made watches. In 1992, Mr. Hans Meissner, who today has over 36-years\u2019 experience in the watch-making industry, directed the aims of the company towards more ambitious horizons: recreating legendary time pieces. Hans Meissner is a firm believer in two things:  \n\u2022 That there is much in the history of watch making that is worth resurrecting and making available to everyone wishing to own a piece of watch making history, but priced to wear every day.\n\u2022 That a watch is worn on the wrist and money is kept in the pocket! A watch, even of high quality, does not need to cost 3,000.00\u20ac or more.\nWith these principles, WM of Switzerland proceeded to design and develop high quality wrist watches at a fraction of the costs of its competitors through the continuous search of components and manufacturing processes in close cooperation with world-wide suppliers.\n      WM of Switzerland offers its timepieces directly to you, without the intervention of any local distributors, and thus is able to save expenses on advertising and overheads, which we pass straight on to you. WM of Switzerland today trades internationally with a specific emphasis on the use of the web, at very low costs. We invest our money in research and in the design of new creations.\nAccording to the Smithsonian \"In 1927, Canadian-born Warren Marrison, a telecommunications engineer, was searching for reliable frequency standards at Bell Telephone Laboratories.\n Building on earlier work in piezoelectricity, he developed a very large, highly accurate clock based on the regular vibrations of a quartz crystal in an electrical circuit\" - the first quartz clock. Later, in 1967, the Centre Electronique Horloger (CEH) in Neuch\u00e2tel (Switzerland) designed the first quartz movement wrist-watch, famously known as Beta 21, and 2 years later, in 1969, Seiko launched its Seiko Astron, the very first commercially sold quartz movement wrist-watch.\n  Marrison\u2019s discovery proved to be of a revolution in the measure of time. Since early 1940\u2019s, laboratories in all the world, responsible for the measurement of time and public centres reporting the exact time, started to switch from mechanical measurement instruments to quartz measurement instruments.    \nThe quartz watch revolutionized the watch industry and from the early 1980\u2019s all Swiss manufacturers designed and launched their different quartz movement wrist-watches. Originally all of them were classical round dial watches, until the advent of the Tonneau case. The Tonneau case is so called because it\u2019s design and form reminiscent of a wine barrel or cask (tonneau in French).  \nThis Tonneau case is used by the world's most prestigious watch manufacturers including Rolex, Patek Philippe, Breitling, Oris, and other. However, due to the technical difficulties it entails \u2013 it is not common to find a Chronograph watch with a a Tonneau Case The WM of Switzerland Tonneau Quartz Chronograph is simply an example of this exploit in technology and design.\n    Water-resistant 5 ATM (50 metres). \n1 ATM is the standard pressure of the atmostphere at sea level, equivelant to a depth of 10 meters. The Tonneau Quartz Chronograph is water resistant to an incredible depth of 5 ATM\u2019s or 50 meters (165 Feet).\n2-year international guarantee.\nThe WM of Switzerland Tonneau Quartz Chronograph is guaranteed internationally by WM of Switzerland for a period of 2 years from date of purchase.\nThe WM of Switzerland Tonneau Chronograph is available in three different versions:\na) Stainless-steel case\nb) Yellow Gold-plated\nc) Exclusive Ros\u00e9 Gold-plated  \nAll three versions presented with a genuine brown leather strap.\nThe watch will be delivered in a beautiful leather style case and accompanied with its corresponding 2 year international warranty certificate.\n   The full retail price for the WM of Switzerland Tonneau Chronograph with Stainless Steel case will be 499EUR/565USD and in the Gold-plated version (yellow Gold or exclusive Ros\u00e9 Gold) 599EUR/675USD. These watches cannot be found at any retail store worldwide. \n                    Stretch Goals Stretch Goals  if we are successful in raising our funding goal we will announce the first of our stretch goals at the top of our campaign page.   \nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING\nThe WM of Switzerland Tonneau Quartz Chronograph watch will be shipped anywhere in the world. However, international customers are responsible for any duties that may be charged in their respective countries.  \nEstimated Delivery\nWe expect to be fulfilling orders in October 2016. While we do not expect this deadline to move, it is possible that the estimated shipment month may shift. If at anytime you would like an update, please check the \"Updates\" section of our Kickstarter campaign.  \nWarranty\nAll WM of Switzerland watches include a 2 years international warranty.\n    ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nForecasting Risk\n\nTaking the WM of Switzerland Tonneau from prototype to production will almost certainly have unforeseen issues, but we've done our best to forecast demand and create a solid production plan.

Click HERE!\nPrey for the Gods is coming to PS4, Xbox One, Mac and Steam, with successful campaign completion! No stretch goal required.\n  Read about this recent announcement of PS4 & Xbox One.\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/802508750/prey-for-the-gods/posts/1635921\n  In Prey for the Gods, you play a lone hero sent to the edge of a dying world to discover the mystery behind a never-ending winter. Arriving with only the clothes on your back, you must survive the colossal dangers that you encounter. To restore balance and reclaim the land from the brink, you will be faced with questions that not even a God knows the answer to.\nCore Features:\nColossal battles with giants where you can climb your foes \nA vast and mysterious frozen world with dynamic snow terrain that you must traverse\nIntense survival game play\nExplore mysterious temples that contain secrets and treasure.\nDynamic weather and day/night cycle\nNon-linear game play where you choose who to battle and how\nLoot the fallen heroes and equip yourself with weapons and supplies\nUnique musical score\n  Prey for the Gods ambitiously combines the game play of Shadow of the Colossus, Deus Ex, DayZ, and BloodBorne. It has tight controls, action-packed boss fights and a frozen mysterious world to explore.\nPrey for the Gods can be played with a keyboard or a game pad. Your basic actions are attack, move and dodge/climb. Simple to learn and critical to master. You control the hero from a third person perspective and can explore the world in any direction. Dodging is crucial as the creatures that inhabit this island are not forgiving in battle and will not give mercy.\nThe combat in Prey for the Gods is fast-paced, brutal, and up to you. Each of the giants you encounter will be unique. To be victorious, you need to discover and exploit their weaknesses then climb on and defeat them. Do you take the giants head-on and dodge their massive attacks, striking when the time is right? Or hide from their gaze and sneak up on them? Pick up a sword, find a bow and arrow, fly through the air with a grapple hook, or use your bare hands.\nYou decide how to fight, and you decide how to survive. In battle, weapons can break, and arrows are finite, so do your best to make every shot count. Luckily, you can pull out the arrows you shoot. Discover the giants weaknesses, climb and defeat them.\n    Composer Ian Dorsch has been writing and recording music for games and related media for the better part of 15 years. His game audio work runs the gamut from AAA (Gears of War 3, Xbox Fitness) to indie (Airborn \u2013 Pino\u2019s Journey), and as a contributor to Polygon, The Escapist and Gamers With Jobs, Ian has written theme music for some of the longest-running podcasts and video series in gaming (Zero Punctuation). In addition to his work as a freelance composer, Ian is also a singer and choir director, and he currently directs the Grays Harbor Chamber Singers and the Vestr Singers, a professional vocal ensemble from the Seattle area.\nSkewsound has the experience and talent to bring the cold atmosphere of Prey for the Gods to life. Having done sound and music for a number of AAA and notable indie games including Chariot, Lost Within, Knee Deep, Magic Circle, RockBand 4, Gigantic, and Grim Dawn\nExploration is rewarding but risky. Luckily, your footsteps in deep snow will help guide you back if you get lost. However, the deeper the snow the more tired and hungry you will be. Hunt for food, then pick up what you can and find a safe cave to rest. Build yourself up from nothing, salvage items and weapons from fallen heroes including swords, bows, outfits, and more.\nSpend too long out in the cold and risk exposure that will chill you to the bone. Our dynamic weather system is treacherous and ever changing. From a sunny day, to a blizzard at a moment\u2019s notice you never know what to expect. The weather is just as dangerous as the giants you are after. A trek out to find your next foe could have you changing course and looking for shelter to warm yourself.\n   \nNo Matter Studios is developing Prey for the Gods. Comprised of three veteran game developers with approximately 30+ years of combined experience.\nBrian Parnell - @brianjparnell\n\"Director\"\nArt and Design and email LOTS of email;)\nIn 2004, I got my first job play testing at Nintendo and then my first development job as an artist at Iron Lore working on Titan Quest, Titan Quest: Immortal Throne, Dawn of War: Soulstorm. After that I worked at Harmonix which included Rock Band 2, & RockBand: Beatles. I mainly did 3D character art and some concept/UI work too before getting more interested in proper management and focusing on game development as a whole. All of this while staying up late helping with friends indie projects including Natural Selection 2, and Grim Dawn. \nTim Wiese - @timjwiese\n\"Alchemist\" Art and Programming\n\"I've been working in the games industry since 2009, started off as an Environment Artist and over I time transitioned into Technical Artist/Tools Engineer, then to Engineer. As a gamer with love for a good story, I'm driven by the desire to develop a game that is Fun first and foremost (yes fun with a capital \"F\", it's important), with the depth to leave a lasting mark.\"\nHung-Chien Liao - @akyangliao\n\"Architect\", Programming\n\u201cI make the magic happen.\u201d That\u2019s all Chien wanted to say, mainly because the guy is too busy atm.\n  We started development of Prey for the Gods game in 2014 part time. We've been full time, living on our savings, since January 2016. For 3 people, we've come pretty far and are about 25% of the way in development. While we've come a long way, there's still a lot of work left to do. In order for us to continue development and keep creative control we need to ask for your help.\n    UPDATE: Prey for the Gods will launch with 5 bosses. At the initial budget of $300k, we'll release the game on Windows/Steam with boss types ranging from bipedal, quadruped and flying body types. Following Steam release we will begin porting the game to PS4, and Xbox One. This combined with intense survival based action combat, dynamic weather, and non-linear game play will give players a great experience at a fair value.  \nFurther stretch goals allow us to expand scope. We can add more art, animations, orchestral score, and more bosses. Most importantly we can hire an animator and hire a world builder. \nBoss stretch goals will be released after the initial 5 boss launch on Windows/Steam and not-simultaneous console release. Stretch goal bosses will be free to all backers that back at the $15 amount or more. \nStretch Goals!\n    $15 Backer = PC Digital Copy of the game, to be delivered via Steam upon release.\n  $25 Backer Plus = A Digital copy of Prey for the Gods (choose which platform if stretch goals are met), Elite Grappling Hook In-Game Item, & Digital Wall Papers\n  $35 Backer Deluxe = Digital copy of the Original Soundtrack for Prey for the Gods, and a digital copy of the Art Book.

To do this we have put in a great deal of our own funds into the development of this so far. It was important to us to have real skin in this before asking for outside funding. We have also been incredibly ruthless with our scope and brutal with our budgeting. Because of this effort we\u2019re able to have a road map that we feel comfortable with as Prey for the Gods come to fruition with your help.\n\nSCHEDULE RISK: There is inherent risk in completing any project let alone a video game project. Estimates are much harder to lock down early in development. Prey for the Gods is far enough along in development to shed some of that risk, but it needs your help to get across the finish line. We have been working on this game part time since 2014 and full time since January 2016. During that time we\u2019ve developed, and documented our core mechanics, game play loops, combat, climbing tech, and weather systems. Doing this has allowed us the ability to scope and estimate more accurately. However, we\u2019ve been shipped a number of games and we know that even with the best planning development can change, and slip. Given our past game development experience we know how to manage this when it does crop up and our backers will be first to know and we will do our best to meet those challenges head on.\n\nCONSOLES: We've listened to our fans and placed consoles platforms in a position where we can make it work for our development. To make this possible we had to remove the Mac version. This was no easy decision but one that we feel is possible if the stretch goals are met. It is very likely that the console development will be staggered to allow us the time and resources to release each version in the best state possible. To speed this up it could mean working with partners to deliver specific platform versions for an even smoother deadline, by entering into these partnerships it can also push out other platform releases for a number of reasons.\n\nHYPE vs REALITY: Our plan is to stay as true to our vision and make necessary adjustments for the goals of making the game as fun, and exciting as possible. However, sometimes the last 10% of development can take 90% of the time. Luckily, we\u2019ve made enough solid games to understand that early feedback and iteration are key. Our plan is to do play-testing during development to help us guide that polish so that we focus on what matters most.

Sometimes we take time to make adjustments in order to deliver a better game. Other times we take time because there are external factors that push our hand. This is one of those times where external factors have come into play.\n\nAs mentioned in a previous update, one of us has been dealing with an unexpected family emergency.

In the meantime, we will continue to polish and finalize the game, but this means that we will not make our April release target as hoped. We're sorry that you'll have to wait a little longer, but we need to do what's right by our team and the people closest to them.\n\nWe're a small studio and we want to keep it that way. The downside is that when one of us needs to take some unexpected time away, it means that 33% of our company is suddenly not there.

It was a revolutionary step forward for the medium in a time when developers first began experimenting with interactive story telling.\nPlayers were trapped aboard Citadel Station as they fought to survive against the cyborgs and mutated crew members corrupted by a maniacal A.I. known as SHODAN, one of the most treacherous antagonists ever conceived. System Shock offered an unparalleled experience that would solidify it as one of the greatest games of all time.\nSystem Shock - Big Box Collectors Edition\n    We want to demonstrate our commitment and passion for System Shock by providing a fun and exciting experience to potential backers. This demo represents the look and feel that we want to achieve with the final version we'll deliver to you, our backers. Please be aware, this is a proof of concept; the PERFORMANCE, FEATURES, and VISUALS are subject to change. We hope you enjoy your time aboard Citadel Station! SHODAN eagerly awaits your arrival...\n                                            PLAY\n\n                                                                                                         Caught during a risky break-in, you become indentured to a greedy TriOptimum executive. After six months in a healing coma, you awaken to discover the surgeons are missing, the station is in disrepair, and the once-prime corporate facility now teems with mindless cyborgs, robots, and mutated beings, all programmed to serve a ruthless A.I.: SHODAN. There's scarcely time to think before it unleashes the first terror...\nCortex Reaver Concept Art - by Robb Waters\nTo help shape and direct the existing narrative of System Shock, we've enlisted the help of Chris Avellone, who is best known for his work on a number of role-playing games, including; Fallout: New Vegas, Wasteland 2, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II, Planescape: Torment, and Fallout 2. Chris will be working closely with Stephen Kick (our Creative Director) and Jason Fader (our Project Director and Senior Producer from Fallout: New Vegas) as well as several other key developers from Fallout: New Vegas to bring modern AAA quality into the world of System Shock.\nChris has been a long-time fan of the System Shock series, and we\u2019re very eager to work with his design expertise to improve Citadel Station.\n  General Features\n\u2192 A modern take on System Shock, a faithful reboot; it\u2019s not Citadel Station as it was, but as you remember it. Many improvements, overhauls and changes are being implemented to capture the spirit of what the original game was trying to convey, and bring it to contemporary gamers.\n\u2192 Re-imagined enemies, weapons, and locations by original concept artist Robb Waters.\n\u2192 Terri Brosius reprises her role as SHODAN, and new VO will be recorded.\n\u2192 Brand new musical score composed by Jonathan Peros.\n\u2192 The user interface, game mechanics, enemies, and puzzles will be updated to reflect modern aesthetics and sensibilities, while maintaining the feel of the original.\nScope Features\n\u2192 $900k Goal: Modern Inventory Management, Modern Controls, New Puzzles, Updated Faithful Levels, Game Difficulty Modes.\n\u2192 $1.7m Goal : Enemy limb dismemberment, More puzzles, Ammo types/weapon settings, Vending machines, Weapon upgrading, Hardcore mode (No respawning), Ironman mode (Only 1 savegame. If you die, the save is deleted)\n    We wanted the art of System Shock to be fresh and new while still remaining true to the aesthetics of the 1994 classic. We've maintained much of the original look, while accentuating it beautifully by an array of modern rendering features such as Physically Based Rendering (PBR), screen-space reflections, real-time global illumination, ambient occlusion (HBAO), volumetric particles, and dynamic lighting. It's the world you remember:\n Leading our conceptual efforts is Robb Waters, the original concept artist from System Shock, the BioShock series, Thief, and Freedom Force. He's been tasked with revisiting his work from 1994 and re-imagining it. It's been very exciting seeing his designs evolve through the process.\n          We want this game to be as chilling to players today as the original System Shock was when it was released in 1994. What is most important to us is taking the essence of the original game, and emphasizing that as we present it to gamers today. With the knowledge and technological improvements over the last 22 years since the original, we can communicate the story of Citadel Station more effectively than ever.\nSystem Shock will have a dramatic and modern take on a musical score. Combining its root sci-fi elements with dynamic acoustic elements \u00e0 la BioShock, we are striving to set System Shock apart from other more action-based shooters as an atmospheric and dark experience.\nPrague's FILMharmonic Orchestra; Civilization V, Hostel, Halo Wars, et al. (see stretch goals)\nThough computer music software has improved exponentially in the last decade, there is no equivalent to the breathtaking and visceral sounds that real instruments can produce. We have been working with Videri String Quartet, and we are in talks with Prague's FILMharmonic Orchestra about recording the score for System Shock. They're a very professional orchestra, having recorded scores for Civilization V, Thief, Hostel, Dream Theater, and many more projects. If we can reach the stretch goal required to afford everything that it takes to record a full orchestra, the game's musical experience will be much more expressive and terrifying than would ever be possible without.\nThough for a modern game like System Shock, a more restrained and dramatic approach is called for, we are also really excited to bring the old System Shock tunes back to life in an updated way! With a roster of world-class musicians, we have set a stretch goal to release a remixed version of the original soundtrack intact! Please help us to make this a reality so that we cannot only provide a strong modern gameplay experience, but also give the old tunes the love that they deserve!\nNightdive Studios - Composer and Sound Designer, Jonathan Peros (Working in the Studio)\n    Nightdive Studios is comprised of industry veterans passionate about developing a faithful reboot of one of our favorite games.\n We understand the risks and challenges there are when creating a compelling experience and with the help and guidance from the original Looking Glass/Irrational Team (as well as AAA RPG developers directly on the team) we are poised to deliver a worthy entry to the System Shock universe. Here are just a few of the games we've worked on:\n    The full release of System Shock will be initially available for Windows and Xbox One. The Windows version will be available on Steam, Humble, and GOG (DRM-free). OSX and Linux versions will be unlocked when our first stretch goal is reached. We\u2019re open to other platforms in the future.\n    Nightdive Studios is a small team of passionate and talented developers and while we're able to operate on the revenue we earn from the sales of our classic games catalog, it's only enough to continue funding our core business. With our transition into full-time development, we'll need help from you, the fans and members of the crowdfunding community to get us off to a great start. We want to make this game with the fans, and it\u2019s important to us to remain independent for that reason. Ultimately, this game is for you. We want to ensure your voice is heard and we deliver on what you want. We've done the math, and with $900,000 we're confident we can complete the project and deliver a game (and rewards!) that every Shock fan will love - but with additional funds, we're prepared to increase the scope of the game and include some great stretch goals that will enhance everyone's experience.\n                    We are hoping to exceed our goal in order to bring you a more exciting experience. When our stretch goals are reached, prepare yourself for what is to come including cross-platform integration, new locations, challenges, and multilingual support. \n                                 ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe understand that game development is difficult, and a numbers of risks are involved. Here\u2019s how we\u2019re dealing with that:\n\nFINANCIAL RISK: Games are very expensive to make. We\u2019ve worked on several big-budget games and have senior developers onboard to help budget the project properly. We have frontloaded a great deal of development using our own funds, taking on the risk ourselves. It wasn\u2019t easy, but we\u2019re driven to see our vision of System Shock complete and in your hands. Now, with a pre-alpha demo, we need your help to get us to the finish line!\n\nSCHEDULE RISK: One of the biggest risks with any project is the completion timeline. Early on in a project, estimates are far less accurate than later. Fortunately, we\u2019re starting this campaign at the 25% mark in development, so our estimates are more accurate than usual. Still, game development can be unpredictable at certain stages, and we understand that. Our goal is to do our very best to complete the game as outlined by our funding and stretch goals. Should the schedule need to change, our backers will be the first to know and we\u2019ll be as transparent as possible. We\u2019re in this together.\n\nFUN RISK: Making a fun game is the ultimate goal, but it\u2019s more of an art than a science. Often times a feature may not be as fun as we\u2019d like, and requires more iteration. Luckily, we\u2019re working with some amazing developers that have shipped critically acclaimed AAA titles to help ensure we\u2019ll make the game fun and engaging. During several phases in the project, we\u2019ll be conducting limited focus tests for every level and every feature.

Featuring our most sophisticated designs to date and high spec automatic movements. Its understated style will impress with its presence.\n  We designed the Metropolitan models with the firm belief that style should never get in the way of function, but should naturally derive from it. True style complements function. It should be subtle, never loud or trendy. It should be timeless, never rendered obsolete by new technology.\n  Rossling & Co. has been crafting watches for over three years, with the Metropolitan Automatic being our fourth collection. We have developed strong expertise in design, manufacturing and fulfillment and have solid relationships with experienced manufacturing partners.\nEvery single component of the Metropolitan is made from superior materials to ensure flawless operations for years to come. It was designed to be an heirloom to be passed down to the next generation.\n  Our direct-to-consumer business model means we skip the distributors and retailers and pass the savings down to you.\n  Exhibition caseback allows full view of the automatic movement\nThe Metropolitan Automatic models all feature an exhibition caseback with a large window showcasing the beautiful automatic movement. You will be able to observe the rotor spinning and admire the engineering that goes into the design of the beating heart of an automatic watch.\nDouble domed bubble crystal\nOne of the signature elements of the Metropolitan Automatic collection is the double domed bubble crystal covering the dial. Reminiscent of the bold mid-century modern designs of the 60s, it gives the watch an undeniable presence. The domed shape creates a slight distortion at the edge of the crystal, a signature look of 60s watches and part of the unique character of the Metropolitan watch.\nMiyota 9015 movement (courtesy Miyota Citizen Japan)\nThe Calibre 90S5/9015 used in the Metropolitan Automatic watches is an exceptional high-spec, Japan-made automatic movement featuring a 42-hour power reserve.\nIt is a 3-hand movement that has been favorably compared to the ETA2824 movement used in luxury watches such as Baume & Mercier, Bell & Ross and Tudor.\nIts high 28,800 bph (8 beats per second) impart it with a super smooth sweep of the seconds hand.\nIt was developed and is manufactured by Miyota, an iconic Japanese manufacturer with a reputation for quality, reliability and precision. The 90S5/9015 is ideally suited for an heirloom watch like the Rossling & Co. Metropolitan.\nFaux-croc genuine leather straps\nAll Metropolitan Automatic watches feature a faux-croc genuine leather strap with genuine leather backing for ultimate comfort and durability. The polished buckle is engraved with the Rossling & Co. logo.\nSolid stainless steel 316L case and crown\nThe case of the watch is made of highly polished stainless steel (316L) for ultimate durability and strength. The low profile crown allows for easy adjustment of the time or date.\nMetropolitan Automatic dial details\nThe Metropolitan Automatic collection showcases 3 different dial colors (gloss black, gloss white and sunburst blue) each available in 2 dial layout options (Classic and Open-Heart). All dials feature hand-applied polished indices and diamond cut hands.\nThe Open-Heart layout features a round window at 6 o\u2019clock showcasing the 90S5 movement.\nThe Classic layout features a square date window at 6 o\u2019clock.\nCertificate of authenticity and warranty card\nThe Metropolitan Automatic watches available for pre-order will be hand-assembled as a limited-edition. Only 399 watches will be made for each model. Each watch will be delivered with an international 2-year warranty card and a certificate of authenticity. Each watch will feature a unique serial number on the caseback (ex.: 001/399).\n  The Metropolitan Black is for the man of the world. It conveys an air of mystery and effortless charm.\n    PLAY\n\n  PLAY\n\n    The Metropolitan White is for the classical man. Subtle, recognized by those in the know, it exudes confidence and charisma.\n    PLAY\n\n  PLAY\n\n    The Metropolitan Blue is our boldest design; for the man that does not fear being noticed.

[\u2026] a nice formula that mixed value and style.\u201d - Worn & Wound\n\u201cthe watches are seriously awesome\u201d - Cool Material\n\u201cThe Rosslings are attractive watches that could easily find their way into almost any collection.\u201d - The Time Bum\n\u201cAt just over a year old, the Montreal based watch company has left a huge mark on the timepiece world, all-be-it with the aid of crowd-funding behemoth Kickstarter.\u201d - Vouchmag\n\u201cThere is something very appealing about these watches that is hard to put your finger on. It\u2019s in their simplicity and lack of pretension. They aren\u2019t trying to be something they are not, they are just pleasant and easy to wear.\u201d - Worn & Wound\n\u201cWhile, Kickstarter campaigns often dilute true horology in search of profits, Rossling has committed itself to making high-quality watches for less.\u201d - Ivy Time\n\u201cRossling & Co. definitely have made the case as one of the best up-and-coming watchmakers around.\u201d \u2013 Vouchmag\nHere's a small selection of the customer reviews we received for our previous collections:\n\"I had to stop and remember to breath after I opened the box. The gold and blue with the domed sapphire was absolutely stunning.\" - Ken L., Modern 36mm - Westhill\n\"Simple and elegant watch. It's timeless and goes with anything. I get compliments all the time from both women and men. It looks classic but bold, love it.\" - Thibault C., Classic 40mm - Glencoe\n\"less is more (sometimes). It is definitely the case here! So thin so light, nothing left to say than; Buy this watch. Simplicity at its best\" - Tobias P., Classic 40mm - Stirling\n\"I am an avid watch collector and I can say that hands down this is my favorite watch. The simplistic design, paired with the unique band garners tons of compliments from family and friends. For the price, there is simply nothing that even comes close to comparing with this watch.\" - Alec A., Classic 40mm - Stirling\n\"One of my favourite watches to date. As a passionate collector I love coming across a fresh design. These guys have kept it simple and pulled off a really beautiful piece. The strap colour is so dynamic I end up wearing this more than the rest of my pieces combined. keep up the great work guys, looking forward to seeing what else you come up with.\" - Luke O., Classic Automatic \u2013 Westhill\nHello! We are Nadim, Terry and Karim, entrepreneurs and watch lovers. We started out as two brothers designing our first watch collection in 2013 after we couldn\u2019t find what we wanted on the market. As the company grew, Karim, our third brother, joined us and Rossling & Co. became three-brothers strong. Our first model was a success beyond our expectations on Kickstarter with close to 1,300 backers. We then launched our Classic Automatic collection in the fall of 2014 and our Modern 36mm collection last summer. Both were huge successes, raising multiple times their initial funding goal. We are beyond excited to launch the Metropolitan Automatic and we can\u2019t wait to get it on your wrists.\n  We are excited to see you join us on this adventure. By pledging for this project, you'll help it become reality. You'll also get yourself one of the few limited edition Metropolitan Automatic watches. You'll choose the specific model that you want. You can also help by sharing the project with friends and family. Word travels fast. By sharing on social media, you will help spread the word and give the project more exposure, allowing it to stretch its wings. More exposure means more backers and more funding. More funding means more stretch goal goodies for everyone!

Or as vegan cookbooks with illustrations of sad rock stars drowning their sorrows in food. Either way, you'll laugh, cry, and learn to make some really tasty recipes.\nAbout the Books:\n  Defensive Eating with Morrissey: Vegan Recipes From the One You Left Behind is a book of beautiful portraits of Smiths star Moz hoarding food; each portrait is accompanied by a poetic vegan recipe, so that you can eat what Morrissey is eating.\nThe praise is already rolling in! \"To dine on these sides is such a heavenly way to dine,\" declaims Wes Allison, co-author of The Taco Cleanse.\nComfort Eating with Nick Cave: Vegan Recipes to Get Deep Inside of You contains portraits of Mr. Cave crying and eating those salty, noodly, cheezy staples that we all crave when we're sad\u2014with recipes for every one.\nWhat's the story behind these unusual books? We asked artist Automne Zingg to write an introduction.\nAutomne's Story:\nIn 2013 I was broke, living in Los Angeles, and going through a terrible breakup. It was probably one of the darkest times in my life and I felt inconsolable. I wasn't working. I wasn't eating. I wasn't drinking. I wasn't doing much of anything except writing depressing songs and listening to even more depressing ones from my youth. I found it curious that the bands that got me through the general malaise of being a sad teenage goth served as a type of sonic comfort food for me as an even sadder adult. Was I having a midlife crisis? The only thing that brought me comfort during this nightmare was drawing. I started to doodle images of Nick Cave crying over pints of ice cream, Siouxsie Sioux devouring tacos, and The Sisters Of Mercy stuffing their faces with Cinnabons. The more time passed, the more surreal these drawings became.\nNick Cave was a particular go to for me during this time and he became the musical equivalent to my grandmother's lasagna. I devoured his music and binge listened for months. It was familiar and comforting; I thought whatever feeling emotional eaters gained from consuming a pint of ice cream, I got from blasting \"Your Funeral...My Trial.\" As heartbroken as I was, I reminded myself that Nick Cave had been through much worse. I wondered what he did during those trying times and found myself unconsciously doodling pictures of him weeping while eating. Each day the drawings got a little weirder and my mood got a little better.\nEventually I started sharing them with others and everyone wanted to see Morrissey putting things in his mouth. Who wouldn't? I obliged and started doing a series of drawings of Morrissey hoarding food.\nNom nom nom. Boo hoo hoo.\nxoxo Automne Zingg\nWe fell in love with Automne's drawings, and asked Joshua Ploeg to write a recipe to go with each one. The spectacular results are here for you to see!\nWhy Kickstarter?\nThese books are sturdy hardcovers without dustjackets (the industry term is \"paper over board\"). They'll hold up to a lot of sad tears, exuberant tears, and kitchen spills. We're Kickstarting them for two reasons: \n1) The world needs to know.\n2) We're committed to printing in the US. Most color books are printed more cheaply in China and then priced artificially low for consumers\u2014so we are raising funds in order to pay for the printing without risking our building and staff, and to keep the price manageable for you, the reader.\nBy backing this project, you help us make an awesome book (and keep making more in the future!), you support manufacturing in the US midwest, and you get to never stop laughing. Win!\nFrom the Moz cookbook\n  From the Cave cookbook\n  About the artist\nThe artist at work\nArtist Automne Zingg originated the internet trend of drawings of goths eating things. Drawing these pictures started as a breakup remedy.... then things escalated. When not drawing, she makes video art and performs music as Lacey Spacecake. She lives in Brooklyn, New York.\nAbout the chef\nYour chef in action\nJoshua Ploeg travels the world cooking vegan food for a wide diversity of parties and causes. He's the author of many vegan cookbooks, most recently This Ain't No Picnic: Your Punk Rock Vegan Cookbook. When not cooking, he sings in punk bands: currently Select Sex, and previously in pioneering queercore bands like Mukilteo Fairies and Behead the Prophet.\nAbout the publisher\nOur store at work!\n  Microcosm Publishing produces brightly-colored books that empower readers to improve their lives and change the world. Inspired by the ethics and aesthetics of punk rock, we've been scrappy and independent since 1996. With our staff of ten and almost 400 titles and 2 million books in print, we still come to work at our Portland, Oregon office and have the most fun every day. \nWe run Kickstarter projects for some of our books for two reasons: So more people can find our books and be delighted and inspired by them, and to pay the bills.

So why Kickstarter? Printing is one of the biggest costs in publishing, and to put out two books at once is a real financial challenge. That's why we're running this campaign!\n\nThere's always the possibility that one of the fine gentlemen lovingly parodied in these books will sue us into oblivion. We ran a fine-toothed legal comb through the books and even asked both Morrissey and Cave point blank if they'd object ... or if they wanted to be involved in the books (Cave's agents graciously declined to be involved; no response from Moz's people). This is America and anyone can sue anyone for anything. But parody is protected under fair use and we think we're well protected.\n\nThe biggest challenge we expect to face is: Will we make our goal? These two books are drawn, written, formatted, edited, layed-out, paperworked, publicized, and basically completely ready to go to print. We've invested a lot in these already. But will we be able to afford to press the send button on that email to the printer? And will this work of art make it into your eager hands?
