Moore is respected by his peers and fans as being one of the best frontmen in music. I personally have witnessed him dazzle rooms that had 15 people as well as 1500 people just as an MC, poet and singer with no script. Imagine what could be done if all the ideas in this man's head had the proper nourishment to actualize into a full on Dr. Madd Vibe show.\nYou see the Dr. Maddvibe experience is not meant to be just a band playing songs, it's a like a carnival, a production with an orchestra of horns, musicians and performers. Angelo's 30 years experience as the Frontman for Fishbone, as well as his extensive spoken word and MC experience has taught him a thing or two about creating an incredible eclectic experience for an audience. Now it is time for Angelo to bring that vision to the world.\nBut as always, in order for the experience to be seen by the public, Angelo will need the resources to do it properly.  Funds will be needed for mixing and mastering the album, CD and merchandise production, rehearsal time and space, paying top notch musicians and performers, promotion, publicity and all the other goodies that go into launching a successful project. Also, the launch through will not only take place in the US but in Europe and Japan as well.\nAnd in regards to the music on this record, Angelo bares his soul like I've never heard before.  This is not just a young punk kid with a blonde mohawk recklessly purging his artistic creativity.  While that spirit still exists it has now been honed in with the maturity that has grown over time.  This record is about a man who has been through the emotional ups and downs from traveling all over the world time and time again while trying to maintain relationships at home with loved ones and friends.  One song in particular called \"Field of Groupies\" showcases Angelo's voice reaching from the depths of pain and transcending to the other side reminiscent of the greatest soul singers who've ever recorded. In the coming weeks we will post a samples for preview courtesy of Angelo's label Mooremapp records. \nLike most artistic pioneers, and as he did with Fishbone before \u201cAlternative\u201d became cool, Angelo has created Dr. Maddvibe outside of the mainstream channels. Instead of answering to executives he's only answering to his fans, who have been loyal to him for many years and have always trusted Angelo to 'bring it.'  So today we are asking you to extend that trust one step further and support this man in taking yet another pioneering artistic vision into the foreground.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #7", "update_userinfo": "Digital Items Out Today", "update_content": "One week left on Kickstarter....time to rally!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #6", "update_userinfo": "A Message From Angelo...", "update_content": "It's Up!.........All 12 songs from the new Maddvibe album can be previewed here in this video.
