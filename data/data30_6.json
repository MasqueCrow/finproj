Since that first product launch, however, we've both managed to shift over to working on our entrepreneurial dream full time for the past 8 years and have even brought in new team members to support us as we grow.With happy customers all over the globe, we're still working together day in and day out designing, sourcing, shipping, and promoting our unique line of products. We've launched 2 more mounts here on Kickstarter (which are still some of our best sellers today) while adding other unique items along the way. Not only do we take great pride in the unique features and affordability of our products, but we also take great pride in our reputation and the customer support that we provide. We deliver on our promises and make it our goal to go above and beyond (check out our Amazon reviews and feedback!).We've been perfecting and relentlessly testing our wallet for over a year now, so we are looking forward to finally getting it into your hands.
