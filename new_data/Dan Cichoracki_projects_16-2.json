[{"backer": "Dan Cichoracki", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Welcome to the latest expansion to the Meanders Modular Battlemaps Range: Wild West where I am seeking your support to create approximately 75 digital maps featuring all of the above with a core Western city called Calamity. \nKickstarted in 2015 - \"Meanders\" is an enormous versatile, tactical  digital mix-and-match of individual battlemaps measuring 27x18\" each, beautifully designed and built in a 1\" = 5ft scale that can be printed, used in, and is sold from the world's best Virtual Tabletop RPG Systems.\n2700x1800 Medium-size Meander 72 DPI\nSimilar in design to the smaller more common Dungeon Tiles - Meanders offer inexpensive hi-resolution gaming maps designed with strategic terrain and extensive tabletop experience as a DM and a player, in mind. The maps are designed to fit together with one another and themselves to create gigantic sprawling worlds to cover your tabletop in seconds - saving valuable time and preparation as a DM.\nCore Maps show Furnished Interiors in Daytime by Default.\n$25 will get you some of what I'm creating (18 Core Maps pre-chosen by me that cover a decent range of finished maps).\n$50 will get you roughly half (40 Core maps pre-chosen by me to cover a wider range of finished maps).\n$75 will get you all of the core maps for a full range of Western Settings (Full 75 Core Map Selection) \n$125 All-In Early Bird ($145 after expiry) will get you all Core Maps plus special extras including a huge 100 piece Wild West Token Pack, Blank Versions to furnish yourself and Exterior Versions (I.e. with Roofing and Signage) for the ultimate in customization + the Four original Meander 1 Wild West Maps.\nThere are No Stretchgoals associated with this campaign - meaning every concept mentioned above in the Wanted Poster will be included or optional and does not need to be unlocked.

Back at $125 or more and you'll be getting 200 tokens instead of 100 and regardless of which pledge you choose, a special Armoured Train - and - Gold-Laden Train map set bonus for your continued support. If you want to become a VIP and get awesome extras, back this campaign to be listed as a VIP in my next one.\nNew to Meanders or seeking to expand your existing collection? Supporting this campaign will see your maps in good company with almost 2000 other compatible maps from series 1-5.\nThis year alone I created over 350 maps for Dwarven Fortress and Lovecraft Country in separate campaigns and aim to complete this project in full by June 2021.  Take a look at why Meanders is a powerful and elegant option for your RPG.\nSince the concept launched I have been continually expanding the range every year aiming to create the world's largest digital modular battlemap system by 2022.  Some of the existing genres and dozens of styles can be seen below. \nSpecial Features of Meanders:\nModularity:\nThere are a lot of ways Meanders can join together - left to right, bottom to top, flipped vertically, or by joining four of one map to itself to create enormous structures and bases. Because there are so many - there are literally millions of possible combinations to let you craft the world you want. Find out more about the powerful mechanisms of the Meanders design through this free downloadable PDF - which will show you the many different ways to join Meanders and an exciting new extension to them that is in development called the SLENDER.\nVersatility:\nEvery Map is created in GIMP and will be supplied to you in six variants: Click the Image below to visit a folder with a free sample of each so you can see the detail and test them for yourself.\nCLICK to Download and Use Finished Map Sample provided in the 6 different formats\n 27x18\" and 300dpi JPEG for Optimal Printing - No Grid (LARGE)\n 27x18\" and 300dpi JPEG for Optimal Printing - 1\" Sq Grid (LARGE)\n27x18\" Hex Grid (LARGE)\n3780x2520 and 72dpi (140px per square) (Roll20)\n2700x1800 and 72 Dpi (100px per square) (MEDIUM)\n1350x900 and 72 Dpi (50px per square) (SMALL)\nThis versatility ensures no matter whether you are printing high-quality maps, need or don't need grids, are using a more powerful tabletop program that doesn't struggle with larger maps or a tabletop program that's hungry for memory - you will have the required format to suit your needs. Each Virtual Tabletop (VTT) out there has its own requirements for memory and formatting and Meanders has a generous variety of formats to make them perfect for all of them.\nReciprocity:\nThe thousands of backers that have allowed me to take this journey have been instrumental in making this enormous system a reality and a continued reality with funding, support, advice and friendship over the years and I take their suggestions on board as to which types of Meanders should be created next to further expand terrain options - in essence acting as an interactive mapsmith -  and honouring my promise to craft the largest most diverse and modular battlemap set the world has ever seen with RPG maps, genres and tropes that are in demand or short supply.\nReliability:\nWith the exception of one campaign (2020) I have delivered to promise and ahead of or on time, every time in all of the 25+ campaigns I have launched on Kickstarter. Many of my backers are return backers because they know I can do what I say I can do and appreciate how hard I work on these maps and expanding the Meanderverse to frequently bring new adventures to their tables. \nA goal of 3000 maps is planned by the close of 2021 to form the most comprehensive interchangeable digital terrain system in the world. While it could already claim that title - I want to leave absolutely no doubt. Meanders (and thousands of tokens compatible with Meanders) sell from Roll20, Fantasy Grounds, Steam, DrivethruRPG, D20Pro and my own website Game Tile Warehouse in various packages, formats and collections unique to the site.\nHere are some Art Samples: please note they are not yet completely finished but represent a best approximate.\n[Swampy Large Cabin with Exterior Stable]\n[Smaller Stores such as Tobacconist, Leatherworker, General Store] - Sample Only, Artwork not complete.\n[Mine Track and Cart System for Gold Mine] Features such as Decor, Lighting, Equipment, not yet added + Road Systems are one of the few speciality Meanders that will not mix with others as easily and require a Blender type of Meander]\nCapturing the Long Shadows cast by taller buildings in the hot sun...\nHere are some of the full map sets already in development and the templates that make them up: \nHuge 12 piece Modular Mine Cart and Mine Map Set\n13 of 15 piece Bayou Swamp Set.\nTemplates for the City Buildings and Structures of Calamity\nIt takes a considerable amount of effort to create a map AND top down assets to go with it - especially so when working with a new genre and a project of this scale and diversity. I have done extensive research on the reality and fantasy of the Wild West to deliver a realistic yet romantic blend with tons of details and aim to provide the RPG Industry with a huge explosion of new maps suited to hundreds of styles of Wild West adventure especially those that use Savage Worlds, Boot Hill, Wild West, Desperados, Western, Time Drifters, Outlaw, Deadlands, Western Hero, GURPS Old West, Far West, Burros and Bandidos, Basic West, Werewolf: The Wild West, The Devils Addition, The Legacy of Zorro, Aces and Eights and anyone wanting to run a comprehensive battle-mapped Western Scenario.\nAs a huge fan of Red Dead Redemption, Gun, Call of Juarez and other Western's on Console Games I am very excited to turn my attention to this greatly over-looked genre.\nDelivery is in June of 2021 and I have already made templates and a start on over 50 maps for this new series. I hope you will join me on this new Frontier.\n\nYou can view available Map Sets in the Meanders series by visiting the Fantasy Grounds, Roll20, Steam, DrivethruRPG or D20Pro stores and type in 'Meanders' - or view or buy them individually or in packs (with dozens of other tools and products for RPG) from my website Game Tile Warehouse.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nArtwork and maps for this series of Meanders are being given a longer amount of time to spend labouring over them with delivery in full on June 2021. \n\nFiles are delivered via Googledrive link download given direct to backers in Kickstarter messaging to retrieve files organized in categorized folders. All files are backed up and safely stored on multiple drives to prevent corruption. I have taken every measure including regular back-up of layered XCF's and finished Jpegs, using a solid state drive, and using a powerful computer that can handle what I throw at it to improve my ability to create my Meanders without incident.\n\nI work very hard on my Meanders Maps, and long hours on each map and rapidly - it is likely I will have the majority of maps completed months earlier but I am giving myself more time to account for any unexpected situations that might arise such as what 2020 threw at us - and to ensure I have ample time to explore new techniques, create all of the new tokens required and tackle the vast array of maps with their own little challenges. If I complete a significant portion I will package and send it ahead of schedule to respective backers giving you something to go on with until another large chunk is completed.\n\nThank you very much for your support,\nKind Regards,\nKris\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge AU$ 25 or more", "title": "A Fistful of Meanders", "descp": "18 Core Maps pre-chosen by me that cover a decent range of finished maps.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}], "stat": ["10 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 50 or more", "title": "The Good, the Bad and the Meander", "descp": "40 Core maps pre-chosen by me to cover a wider range of finished maps", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}], "stat": ["3 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 75 or more", "title": "A Million Ways to Meander in the West", "descp": "Full 75 Core Map Selection (Furnished Interiors)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}], "stat": ["7 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 125 or more", "title": "The Magnificent Meanders", "descp": "All Core Maps (Furnished Interiors) plus special extras including a huge 100 piece Wild West Token Pack, Blank Versions to furnish yourself and Exterior Versions (I.e. with Roofing and Signage) for the ultimate in customization + the Four original Meander 1 Wild West Maps.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}], "stat": ["22 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 199 or more", "title": "Meanders Chained (All-In)", "descp": "For anyone wanting Absolutely Everything, $199 will grab everything I am making on offer.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}], "stat": ["10 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 166 or more", "title": "Meanders Unchained (Early Bird All-In)", "descp": "For anyone wanting Absolutely Everything, $166 will grab everything I am making on offer.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "16 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #19", "update_userinfo": "Time to Ride off into the Sunset...", "update_content": "I began to wonder as I placed all those Victorian pipes and fittings, cogs and clockwork - what on earth is it all for, what purpose could it serve?

It's 50 years later, I've had Oscar nominations and won Cannes Festival awards, and it's time to fulfill a boyhood dream.\nThree years ago, I wrote out a storyboard about a slide guitar-playing cowboy named Slide who appears in a corrupt logging town (circa 1940's) to battle a pair of evil twins and save the village of Sourdough Creek.\nSLIDE has villains, an old-time country music cowboy band, the Lucky Buck Saloon and Bordello, and a glorious Oregon backdrop (And it features a hero who, like me, plays the slide guitar.)\nBy raising our $77,800 minimum goal here on Kickstarter my team and I will be able to devote most of the next six months to SLIDE, with a completion date in 2022.\nBut I want to get SLIDE to you sooner.\nWe have a very ambitious $200,000 \"stretch\" goal that would allow us to complete SLIDE by this time next year - and wouldn't it be great to have a new animated film ready for our safe return to theaters!\nI think you're going to love the rewards: Attend the New York City premiere of SLIDE; Take a private animation class with me, either via Zoom or (after the pandemic) in my NYC studio; And ALL backers at the $100 level or higher will see their name in the closing credits!\nI'm also drawing the caricature of at least one backer who will get to play a Old West villain, have a speaking role, see their name in the closing credits, AND get an IMDb credit.\nBest of all, on Dec. 18, 2020 we're sending out a survey to all of our backers, giving you the option of gifting one of our rewards in time for the holidays. We'll email a gift certificate for the reward you select to the recipient you designate.\nOne of the cool advantages of going to Kickstarter now, halfway through the production, is that we have a lot of clips and sequences to share.  Follow me on Facebook daily during the campaign as I do a drawing a day on camera so you can see how I create my characters and animation.\nPeople call me the \"King of Indie Animation\" and I hope to capitalize on that moniker to give people an inside look at how I create my films - from the concept to the editing and music.  \nThanks for supporting independent animation, and a sincere thanks for supporting me and my new film SLIDE with your generous pledge.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs an independent filmmaker, being self-financed is a risk all by itself.

And the income from those projects is very helpful in keeping my studio running - but it only gets me about halfway there if I want to keep creating my own animated shorts and features. Some advance theatrical distribution money from France also helps, but I've used Kickstarter to help fill the gap. My fans have helped with the production of two features, \"Cheatin'\" and \"Revengeance\", and a series of political shorts called \"Trump Bites\". My hardcore fans have bought their DVD or streaming copies in advance, which gets me the money early to finish animating the film faster, I don't have to wait for another big commercial project to come in and fund the feature.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Insider Sneak Peeks", "descp": "Follow Bill through the making of SLIDE with exclusive updates, stills and animated clips available only to Kickstarter backers.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2021"}], "stat": ["51 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Stream SLIDE at Home", "descp": "We'll send you a private link to stream SLIDE once it completes its theatrical premiere and/or Oscar qualification PLUS sneak peeks into the making of SLIDE.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2022"}], "stat": ["112 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Autographed DVD of SLIDE", "descp": "You\u2019ll receive a limited edition DVD of \"Slide\", hand-signed by Bill Plympton, and mailed to your home after the film\u2019s theatrical run and Oscar-qualification process.

A coming-of-age story told through multiple games and genres, worlds and characters. Experience the thrill of shooting, driving, jumping, fighting and role-playing \u2013 combined with emotional, cinematic storytelling. Welcome to the world of 198X \u2013 where a new life is just 1 credit away. \nThe game is set in Suburbia, just outside the City, sometime in 198X. It follows the journey of Kid, a teenager stuck between the limitations of innocent youth and the obligations of inevitable adulthood. The story unfolds when Kid discovers the local arcade \u2013 finding new worlds, and new meaning, in video games. For every visit to the arcade \u2013 every game uncovered, every move mastered, every demon defeated \u2013 Kid grows stronger. And the lines between game and reality starts to blur\u2026\nThe world, story and cast of 198X are brought to life by an elite team of talented pixel artists from all around the world.\n198X is built around five distinct arcade games, each inspired by classic themes and genres. These fully playable games feature several full-blown stages with familiar settings and unmistakable core mechanics, as well as unique twists and unexpected turns.\nHARD-HITTING NO-NONSENSE STREET FIGHTING\nFeel the rush of hardcore vigilantism as you rid the back alleys of hoodlum filth and punk gangsters. Expect bruised knuckles as danger lurks around every corner. This is inner city peacekeeping-by-force so lethal you\u2019ll feel the pain yourself.\nLASER-POWERED OUTER SPACE MECHA MAYHEM\nIn the cold of the cosmos, a lone fighter dares defy the mechanical armada of automated death. Warp into the vast unknown and power up those plasma cannons, as the odds are stacked against you \u2013 big time.\nPEDAL-TO-THE METAL MIDNIGHT CRUISING\nTake your deluxe sports car for the ride of your life. Race the setting sun to reach the metropolis of your dreams, brilliant as a gemstone in the dark. Cruise with attitude as you overtake nobodies and become one with the rhythm of the open road.\nSHARP-AS-A-KNIFE\u2019S-EDGE ACROBATIC ACTION \nPut on your mask and sharpen that blade, warrior! Mythological monster slaying is on the agenda. Enter zen as you face fierce demons from ancient folklore, dodging and dashing, dislodging and slashing until no one draws breath but you. This is the literal bleeding edge.\nVIRTUALLY VIRTUAL GLITCHED-OUT DUNGEON CRAWLING\nExplore the labyrinthine circuits of a rogue AI and cut the code to its digital dominion. Battle cyber abominations stuck between reality and glitch, as you navigate the artificial but all-to-real grid in your desperate search for a way out \u2013 or a way in\u2026\nMany prominent scenes take place in the arcade, where the game alters between emotional storytelling and over-the-top gameplay action.\nHi-Bit Studios is based in Stockholm, Sweden, but our creative team is spread out all over the world \u2013 from Bordeaux, France to Nagoya, Japan. The inspiration for 198X come from our collective love for and deep knowledge of pixel art and the golden age of arcade games. Everyone in our team of 11 people have their own unique experiences from working in or near the games industry \u2013 as artists, programmers, writers, editors, managers \u2013 for many years. Individually we have been involved in both indie and bigger budget game development, created critically acclaimed books and magazines, and founded Stockholm Museum of Video Games in order to preserve and celebrate the very art form we are now united and determined to contribute to.\nWriter & director: Tobias Bjarneby // Game Designers: Daniel Eyre & Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m // Graphic Artists: Alexis \u201dMr HK\u201d Morille, Catherine \u201dEinzbern\u201d Menabde, Paul \u201dDoomcube\u201d Conway, Tim Jonsson & Motocross Saito // Programmer: Johan H\u00f6gfeldt, Odd Raven Studios // Music: U.F.L, Yuzo Koshiro // Music Advisor: Thomas B\u00f6cker // Graphic Designer: Markus Karlsson Frost //Producer: Daniel Grigorov\nWork on 198X started in Spring 2017, and the game is scheduled for release in March 2019, across current-gen consoles (PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch) and PC. We have already built several Unity based engines, and started designing stages and game mechanics to make sure we can deliver on our goals. \nIncluded in our reward tiers you\u2019ll find this T-shirt, badge and poster, as well as the soundtrack on a limited edition colored 12\u201d vinyl record.\nThis unique 198X arcade cabinet is being designed and custom built by renowned craftsman Love Hult\u00e9n.\nThe soundtrack \u201d198X by Yuzo Koshiro\u201d is now available for pre-order as an exclusive 12\u201d colored vinyl.\nThe boxed version of the game \u2013 198X: Day Zero Edition\nSTRETCH GOALS\n600 000 SEK ($68 600): 10 ADDITIONAL CUTSCENES\nThe overall narrative of 198X is mostly (but not exclusively...) centred around highly detailed, hand-pixeled cutscenes. If this stretch goal is met, we will add 10 additional full cutscenes to the game, further enriching the game's plot and letting players resonate with Kid's journey even more.\n700 000 SEK ($80 000) : GALLERY MODE\nEnjoy the intricate backgrounds and elaborate sprite work of 198X at your own leisure, along with a sound test featuring every music track in the game. Hang out in Kid's room or stay in the arcade for as long as you like, while listening to your favorite tracks from the game.\n900 000 SEK ($102 900): \u201dTHE STRANGER\u201d\n198X is a focused, story-driven experience. But there just might be room for sidetracks as well. \"The Stranger\" is a road trip tale taking place within our racing game, a separate short story providing additional details about the world of 198X.\nYou can always come back here for the latest updates on this project.

But as individuals we have been working in and near the industry for ages, producing not only video games but also books, magazines and digital media.

Now, I\u2019m funding a complete version as a full color, hardbound book, packed with amazing art and useful tools.\nIn Cartel, you play bold narcos, na\u00efve spouses, and dirty cops tied to the Sinaloa drug cartel, facing a dangerous game of drugs, money, and power. Navigate dangerous relationships, make desperate plays for money and power, and discover how far you are willing to go to hold on to what is yours. Buena suerte, cabr\u00f3n.\nCartel is based on the Powered by the Apocalypse system used in Apocalypse World, Urban Shadows, and more. When your character takes an action that fits a move, the move tells you what happens in the story or you roll two six-sided dice to find out. Each move is a tense beat of a narrative, an opportunity for the drama of Cartel to build to a bloody climax.\nCartel creates adult fiction in the vein of Breaking Bad, The Wire, and El Mariachi, making it fun for lovers of crime fiction and Mexican melodramas alike. Cartel has the mechanical strength and narrative flexibility to create stories that are alternately tragic and darkly humorous, set against the backdrop of an eternal drug war.\nMexico, 2007. The Free and Sovereign State of Durango. Ten hours from the US border. A small but thriving ciudad known for its stunning cathedrals and annual street festivals.\nDurango also lies between two of the most powerful drug trafficking organizations in the world: the long-established Sinaloa Cartel and the up-and-coming Los Zetas. \nThe Sinaloa Cartel: a vast and sprawling network moving drugs from Central America into Los Estados Unidos, China, and Europe. Well-established and ubiquitous, capable of infiltrating city police departments, Mexican state governments...even the DEA. \nLos Zetas: formerly the enforcers of the Gulf Cartel, Mexican Special Forces who defected when it looked like Mexico might actually prosecute terror squads for war crimes. Ordinary Mexicans call them La \u00daltima Letra (The Last Letter) or \u201cThose who should not be named.\u201d\nSo here you are. Connected to la plaza in Durango. Maybe you\u2019re just el halc\u00f3n, and you run errands for the big jefes. Maybe you\u2019re la sicaria, an enforcer, returned from an early retirement in the States. Maybe you\u2019re just married into the cartel, but your esposa means the world to you. Maybe you\u2019re el narco himself, and this plaza is yours to lose.\nNo matter who you are, not even the Sinaloa Cartel can keep you safe. You\u2019ve got amigos, but you can't trust anyone. Your boss would throw you under the bus to save himself, and your enemigos would do far worse to get ahead. And that's before you start worrying about your familia asking for money or los federales listening in on your every phone call.\nAnd don\u2019t forget Los Zetas. Don\u2019t ever forget Los Zetas, cabr\u00f3n.\nI started working on Cartel around the same time that I wrapped up writing Urban Shadows. I was so proud of the urban politics and community realities that Andrew Medeiros and I had brought to the game, but I wanted to do more to connect my work with my culture.\nBut when I started working on my \"Latino\" game, I struggled to connect my distinct perspective to an experience players would love. I couldn't just set a game in Mexico; I had to find a time and a place that would evoke the pain and the promise of my culture while giving players an experience that was worth having again and again.\nMe (left) as a young folklorico dancer in 1989\nAs I watched Breaking Bad, it clicked for me. Breaking Bad is set in my hometown, Albuquerque, NM, but it\u2019s a story about white people. It explores themes and ideas that are central to my heritage\u2026but with Latinos at the fringes. I realized that the game I wanted to write was right in front of me: the drug war, from the perspective of the Mexican people who live in the middle of it.\nFor me, Cartel isn\u2019t about glorifying drugs; it\u2019s about finding human moments amidst the sprawling catastrophe known as the War on Drugs. It\u2019s about exploring what it means to live in the supply chain. It\u2019s about connecting across borders, and seeing the people (and their conflicts) on the other side.\nYears ago, I asked myself what a Mexican-American RPG looked like: Cartel is my answer.\nCartel is a game for 3-5 players, and it plays a single session in 2-4 hours. Each game may last one session\u2014or a few sessions\u2014depending upon your desires for your story (see long-term play below).\nCartel is Powered by the Apocalypse: when you trigger one of the game\u2019s moves by taking the appropriate action (like making a deal, justifying your behavior, or turning to violence) you roll two six-sided dice (2d6) and add the appropriate stat, whether it is Face, Grit, Hustle, or Savagery.\nIf your total is a 10 or higher, then that\u2019s a full hit, and you\u2019re going to get most of what you want. Most of what you want.\nIf your total is a 7-9, that\u2019s a partial hit, and you\u2019re either going to have to pay a cost, suffer a complication, or get a reduced result.\nAnd if your total is a 6 or less, that\u2019s a miss...and the MC will tell you what happens. You can expect it won\u2019t be pretty.\nIn Cartel, each player has their own playbook, an archetype and character sheet all rolled into one. Each playbook creates a different kind of character for a Cartel story, packed with their own mechanical and fictional choices.\nThere are six playbooks in the base game of Cartel, and we've added a bunch more through stretch goals (see below). The basic set includes:\nEl Cocinero - Clever, resourceful, and lucky. El Cocinero is a vital part of the cartel\u2019s operation: he cooks the drugs that keep everything else moving.\nLa Esposa - Responsible, protective, and vulnerable. La Esposa is the spouse of a character caught up in the cartel, an innocent bystander tangled in a web of criminal lies.\nEl Halc\u00f3n - Eager, na\u00efve, and tenacious. El Halc\u00f3n is \u201cthe hawk,\u201d the little bird that runs errands, watches out for trouble, and reports back to his handlers.\nEl Narco - Beleaguered, wealthy, and dangerous. El Narco is el jefe, the local Sinaloa head put in charge by the powers-that-be to oversee la plaza.\nLa Polizeta - Greedy, two-faced, and corrupt. La Polizeta is an agent for the cartel that\u2019s wormed her way into the heart of the federal anti-cartel task force.\nLa Sicaria - Deadly, veteran, and cold. La Sicaria is a hitwoman, an enforcer for the cartels who has survived the streets of Durango long enough to become a living legend.\nCartel is actually about talking much more than it is about shooting. Your pistola is a piece of leverage in a conversation long before you pull the trigger... and money and blackmail might be even more efficient. Gun fights in Cartel end a lot faster than you think\u2014bullets are deadly, g\u00fcey.\nThe game puts a heavy emphasis on tense and dramatic conversations, and the vast majority of Cartel\u2019s moves can be triggered just by talking\u2014or texting\u2014with other characters. This is a game about people and how they manipulate each other, and its focus on conversation brings that fiction to the fore.\nYou might try to get the truth about what really happened to the last cocinero. Or you might pressure someone to go along with a heist that's too perfect to pass up. Or you might need to justify yourself when you get caught with your hand in the cookie jar. \nCartel is perfect for short campaigns. The drama of the game can peak in a single session, giving you a full and satisfying arc that rivals your favorite crime movies. Character creation is also simplified, crafting dramatic characters quickly while also ensuring that you\u2019ve got strong enlaces (ties) between the characters.\nCartel also includes a key-based advancement system that keeps characters aimed at interesting actions in the long-term. Each llave (key) gives you a condition that earns you an experience point, and a condition that can earn you a whole advancement, but at the cost of permanently losing the key. Fluctuating keys mean you can change what your character is about by adjusting how you earn experience points.\nSample Llave: Cartel Quickstart\nThanks to the key-based experience system and gamemaster tools that keep the pot of criminal activity constantly stirred, Cartel can easily facilitate a long-term campaign, just as much as it can handle the rapid burst of a crime movie.\nThe Cartel corebook is more than a gateway to the drug war. It's also an elegant tome that captures the feel and look of Mexican art and culture.\nCartel will be a premium 8\u201d x 8\u201d hardcover featuring a case binding with an embossed, spot gloss, and stamped cover. The 150+ matte pages will feature full color interiors and all of the playbooks and move sheets. Cartel will also feature full color end papers and a silk bookmark, all adding to the amazing feel and look of this lush book.\nAmigos y Enemigos (Friends & Enemies) is a collection of 30+ NPCs that you can add to any session of Cartel. Some are friendly figures, but others are monsters and adversaries, the people who will turn Durango to ruins in their pursuit of power and revenge.\nAmigos y Enemigos is a hardcover full-color book (100+ pages, including all stretch goals). Each character will be illustrated, with text and tools to bring them into your game.\nSome reward tiers contain a print supplement of your choice. After the campaign closes, you select specific supplements through Backerkit, including Amigos y Enemigos or Sin Fronteras. All supplements will also be available as add-ons.\nSin Fronteras contains limited edition playbooks, cartas de amor, and more advice about hacking, expanding, and building upon Cartel. I want to give you all new ways to make Cartel work at your table. \u00a1Con madres!\nWe are also offering Sin Fronteras as a hardcover full-color book, including approximately 110+ pages of new playbooks, tools, and hacks.\nSome reward tiers contain a print supplement of your choice. After the campaign closes, you select specific supplements through Backerkit, including Amigos y Enemigos or Sin Fronteras. All supplements will also be available as add-ons.\nEl \u00c1guila y La Serpiente (The Eagle and the Serpent) is a mini-supplement focused on the Central Intelligence Agency.\nEl \u00c1guila y La Serpiente on PDF is included for any $20+ backer. In addition, anyone who backs at the El Narco tier ($150) or above, will get El \u00c1guila y La Serpiente in print as part of their hardcover, special edition Cartel corebook.\nYou cannot select El \u00c1guila y La Serpiente as a printed supplement. It will only be available in print as part of the special edition corebook.\nWe are offering a special edition Cartel corebook that is debossed, embossed, and UV coated. It also contains the CIA supplement (El \u00c1guila y La Serpiente) in print! This book is a Kickstarter exclusive; it will not be available in retail stores after the campaign ends.\nThe Deck of Locations is a game aid designed to bring Durango to life without requiring any extra research before play.\nEach card features a Durango location that can serve as a backdrop for a scene in Cartel\u2014a lavander\u00eda (laundromat) or a catedral (cathedral)\u2014complete with the tools needed to bring that setting to life. The deck now includes 54 cards!\nThe Deck of Locations is available through multiple reward tiers (El Narco, La Barbie, etc.) or as a $20 add-on. It's also included as a PDF for all $20+ backers.\nThe songs of los narcos are called narcocorridos, music that chronicles narco cultura. Each narcocorrido contains a story, often legend and rumor, set to an almost traditional Mexican tune. It's like gangster rap produced by John Philip Sousa.\nAs part of the Cartel Kickstarter, we're making our own album of narcocorridos:\nThe songs presented in Corridos de Durango will be composed by myself and my long-time writing partner, Justin Rogers, with help from Miguel \u00c1ngel Espinoza. We're now producing six custom narcocorridos for the album.\nAnd if you want your own narcocorrido included on the album, cabr\u00f3n, check out REINA DEL PAC\u00cdFICO or EL CHAPO, tiers that include a narcocorrido written just for you...\nCorridos de Durango (mp3) is available through multiple reward tiers (El Narco, La Barbie, La Reina del Pac\u00edfico, or El Chapo) or as a $10/$20 add-on.\nPersistent, tricky, and bold. La Rata has betrayed the cartel, hoping to earn her freedom before los narcos catch on to her machinations.\nThis new playbook will be included in the print/pdf version of the Cartel core rulebook. \nWe're adding five new characters\u2014la polic\u00eda\u2014to the Amigos y Enemigos supplement.\nDriven, pitiless, lost. El G\u00fcero is a CIA operative who's no longer sure which way is up...or who the real villains are anymore.\nWe're adding El G\u00fcero to the CIA mini-supplement in both PDF and print. Remember that the printed mini-supplement only appears in the special edition rulebook!\nWe're adding five new characters\u2014los americanos\u2014to the Amigos y Enemigos supplement.\nWe're adding 15 location cards to the Deck of Locations!\nWe're creating a custom PDF map of Durango, available for download to $20+ backers. We\u2019ll also put 11\u201d by 17\u201d cloth map in El Narco\u2019s Stash and make the cloth map available to everyone as an Add-on ($20).\nWe're adding five characters from la comunidad to Amigos y Enemigos, completing the book (roughly 110+ pages) with lawyers, doctors, and priests.\nAstute, connected, flexible. El Abogangster is the corrupt lawyer who keeps the money flowing and los federales away from everyone important.\nWe're adding two sets of starter prompts for each playbook to Sin Fronteras.\nDogged, oblivious, brave. La Esperanzada is a flicker of hope in the darkness, a cop who hopes to bring the villains of the drug war to justice. \nCharming, reckless, drowning. El Tahur is a gambler who has gotten himself mixed up with los narcos in the worst way: he owes them money.\nInnocent, passionate, doomed. La Mariachi is a local musician who suddenly finds herself caught up in the chaos and danger of the drug war in Durango.\nWe've added two new tattoos, a new santos candle, and thirteen more location cards (for a total of 54 cards)! \u00a1\u00d3rale!\nWe're adding Berlin 1981 to Sin Fronteras, a hack of Cartel for a completely new setting: Cold War Germany.\nWe're adding two more custom narcocorridos to Corridos de Durango, bringing the total to at least six songs!\nWe're adding Aztl\u00e1n 2033 to Sin Fronteras, a hack of Cartel set in a cyberpunk dystopia haunted by programs that hijack human hosts.\nWe'll adding a digital package of Roll20 resources and desktop/phone backgrounds featuring Cartel art.\nWe're making physical copies of Corridos de Durango, complete with lyrics and cover art. We're also adding the CD to El Narco\u2019s Stash and making it available to everyone as an add-on ($20).\nOur last goal: if we reach $60,000, we'll make Cartel t-shirts ($25/each) via in a variety of sizes! \nGet ready, amigos.

In this magical forest, the loudest songbirds claim the ripest berries and prime nesting spots.\nAs a forest spirit, you help your favorite songbird color prosper in secret. Each turn, you\u2019ll place one songbird with a specific volume into the forest.\nThe volume of each songbird will add to those of the same color in rows and columns. The songbird color with the loudest volume wins the berry token in the respective column or row. \nIf there is a tie, the songbird color with the next loudest volume wins.  \nWhen the whole forest is filled with songbirds move on to end-game scoring.\nAt the end of the game, you reveal the last remaining songbird card in your hand. This is your favored songbird and you score the points that the songbird color collected in berry tokens and add in the volume of your favored songbird. The player with the most points wins the game!\nGame Contents:   \n28 Songbird Cards\n10 Berry Tokens\n2 Berry Holder Cards\n2 Special Cards\n5 Special Berry Tokens\nKickstarter Limited Exclusive:\n1 Owl Promo Card and 1 Rules Card\n1 Shrike Promo Card and 1 Rules Card\nThese cards will not be available to buy at retail (unless they are a backer of this campaign), but will be available at conventions and the BGG Store.\nOpinionated Gamers.\nBirdie Fight (the older version) is a simple, beautiful game full of tense decisions. It is also the kind of game that I really enjoy playing and usually never win. It plays in about 10 \u2013 15 minutes so even if I make bad decisions it\u2019ll be over quick. It\u2019s also one that I immediately want to play again.\nGeekDad.\nI loved the colorful bird illustrations and I was expecting a light, simple game, but then I was totally surprised. While the gameplay itself is easy\u2014play a card from your hand into the grid\u2014the strategy will soon have you agonizing over each decision. I love the fact that I can set it up and teach it so quickly, and that such deep gameplay can emerge from a simple set of rules.\nNice Game Hub.\nLet\u2019s be clear: this is a very well designed game. Birdie Fight takes about a minute to explain and 20 minutes to play. However, a lot of intricacy emerges from these simple rules. Competitive players will quickly find their brains burning up, while for more casual players it\u2019s a more casual experience.\nGeeky Hobbies\nThe game does a really good job mixing an accessible game with a surprising amount of strategy. You can learn the game in minutes but it is a game that will take a long time to master. There is actually a lot to think about with regards to what card you want to play and where you want to play it.\nATGN\nDespite its simple gameplay, Songbirds is quite the cerebral challenge. From the very first play of the game, you face tough decisions about not only which card to play, but where to place it! One of my favourite aspects of the game is the decision about which card to hold back and score.\nBrettSpiel News.\n\"Songbird\" does it all right and offers incredible fun. This results from the simple gameplay, coupled with the tactical possibilities that are offered in the game. Until the end it is unclear which outcome the game will take. The game is perfect for two players and even offers a single player mode that also pleases.\nDownload The Rulebook.\nTake a look at the rules now and start planning your strategies on how to be the best songbird in the forest.\nWe don't have a downloadable PnP, but it's pretty easy to make from a standard deck of playing cards. Take the 1-7 of each suit - these are your songbirds. Take the Ace in each suit - these are your Berry Holder cards. Make 10 squares and write a number on each: 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 12, 15. On the other side of the squares, scribble it with a black marker so you can't see through. If you want to use the Special cards, just use one of the Jokers. The rules for each are either in the rulebook or on this KS page.\nYou may add-on an additional copy of Songbirds for $17 within the USA and $23 for worldwide.\n*A Retailer Pledge Level is included in the right hand column of this page for $20. Retailers will receive 12 copies of Songbirds, including all unlocked stretch goals and promo cards, for a total of $120 + shipping. You will be invoiced the remainder of the balance just before we ship rewards. Your rewards will be shipped direct from China. USA retail addresses will receive free shipping. Worldwide retail addresses will be charged additional shipping of $50.\nBacker rewards will ship directly from China via SendFromChina. This means that you will receive your reward weeks ahead of the official release date.

Throughout every campaign, we are as transparent about the process and as open to feedback as possible without jeopardizing production and delivery timelines.\n\n3. We have done significant pre-production. All the art and graphic design files for Songbirds are completed with the exception of the stretch goals content.\n\n4. We have our manufacturer lined up and ready to begin the pre-press process as soon as the the files are delivered.

Explore exotic destinations and earn badges to prove yourself as the galaxy's best explorer.\nWhat makes it unique? \u2013 A destination can be visited if it has a rocket on top. Once a destination is visited the rocket moves clockwise around the board to the next open destination\u2014skipping over any with rockets already on top. Choosing where to go might help you, but it also opens up places for your opponents. \nHow do you win? \u2013 Collect the most Explorer Points (XP) by the end of the game by earning space badges.\nStretch Goals\nGame Setup\n      Rockets begin at the starting destinations and components are placed by their corresponding actions. Each player receives one badge to begin. Three badges are placed face up by Starlight Station and the rest form the the badge deck on top of it.\nGive the First Traveler marker to whoever most recently looked at the stars. Play begins with the First Traveler and proceeds clockwise.\nVisiting Destinations\nOn your turn, you\u2019ll choose which which destination to visit:\nChoose a destination with a rocket on it\nPerform the action of the chosen destination\nMove the rocket to the next destination in the clockwise rotation, skipping over any destinations that already have rockets on them.\nDestination Actions\nYour Trusty, Explorer Bot\u2014Scout\nScout's design will be changing slightly. Take a look at the new one in our latest update.\nScout moves to new destinations when players visit Astral Arcade. Whenever any player visits a destination with Scout on it, the player who currently has the Scouter may choose to gain either a Pink Crystal or a Fast Travel pass from the supply. \nFast Travel\nBefore visiting a destination, Fast Travel tokens can be spent on your turn to move one Rocket to the next available destination\u2014multiple tokens may be spent in a single turn before choosing a destination. \nBadge Perks\nAfter you earn a badge, you'll gain its Explorer Points (XP) in the top right and its perk on the bottom. Some are ongoing whereas others trigger immediately. Getting great badge combos can be a sure way to victory.\nGame End\nWhen a player has reached 20 or more Explorer Points, finish the current round of play so each player gets an equal number of turns\u2014the last player should be the person to the right of the First Traveler. The player with the most Explore Points at the end is the winner of Space Park!\nSolo Mode: Playing Against Scout\nIn solo mode, a player is racing to score 20 XP against Scout who is running through the Badge deck to move himself and the rockets around the board.

It includes a deck of large, tarot-sized cards, beautifully illustrated by world-renowned artist Kerem Beyit. Think of it as a modern deck of playing cards, but instead of playing poker, blackjack, and other traditional card games, a host of designer games utilizing a plethora of modern design mechanics can be played. \nBook of Dragons will release with over 18 games by over 16 designers, including Martin Wallace (Brass, Steam, A Few Acres of Snow, A Study in Emerald), Mike Fitzgerald (Mystery Rummy series, Baseball Highlights 2045, Diamonds), Jonathan Gilmour (Dead of Winter, Atari: Asteroids, Dinosaur Island), David Short (Automobiles, Ground Floor, Bomb Squad), Daniel Solis (Kodama: The Tree Spirits, Trickster, Belle of the Ball), Sen-Foong Lim & Jay Cormier (Belfort, Akrotiri, Junk Art), Ken Shannon (Approaching Dawn: The Witching Hour, Tournament at Camelot), Gil Hova (The Networks, Bad Medicine, Battle Merchants) and many more! The system will also have more games created for it in the future by respected designers, and the community at large. \nMaybe you?\nThe game's large cards feature only artwork, with no text or iconography, making it completely language and color independent. This also makes Book of Dragons a real head turner when on your table.\nBig. Beautiful. Colorful. Dragons!\n  Sure, Book of Dragons is serious eye candy, but that's not what makes it special. It's the games. We've recruited many talented game designers to provide a myriad of games that all utilize this single deck. The retail version will ship with a reference booklet, and three different rulebooks, one that contains light games that are great for families with children, one that contains pub-style/beer & pretzel filler games, and one that contains heavier strategy games.  \nIndividual rulesets are currently in final editing, and graphic design. Below is a sample of our rulebook covers, and page design. You can also review a complete final ruleset design for Dragon Duel by clicking this link.\n  Below are games that will ship with Book of Dragons. Click on a title for each game's current draft rules. Games without a rules link are still in development, but are targeted to be completed before production in February. The retail version will ship with 18 unique new games, but may have up to 25. Plus 10 converted public domain, family-style games.\nDragon's Bluff by Martin Wallace - A bluffing game for 3 or 4 players. \nDragon Mystery Rummy: The Case of the Rare Dragon by Mike Fitzgerald - A rummy game with a twist for 2 to 4 players.\nWyvern's Knot by Jonathan Gilmour & John Burns - A tense cooperative game for 3 to 5 players.\nDragon Master by Sen-Foong Lim & Jay Cormier - An auction and negotiation game for 3 to 5 players.\nSubitus Wyrm by Robert Burke - A personal interaction bluffing game, where you attempt to deceive a single player at a time.\nThe Rut by Max Michael - A push your luck bidding game for 2 to 4 players.\nDragon Kin by Ken Shannon - A hidden scoring and deduction strategy game for 2 to 4 players.\nYear of the Dragon by Daniel Solis - A strategic solitaire game.\nDragon Pass by Gil Hova - A pick and pass set collection and deduction game for 3 to 5 players.\nDragon Inquisition by Nate Bivins - A hidden traitor game for 3 to 5 players.\nDragonflight by Stephen Avery - A dexterity game of flipping cards, triggering abilities, and capturing dragons.\nDragon Duel by Robert Burke - A tactical head-to-head area control battle game for 2 players.\nAge of Dragons by Chris Hamm - A 2 player strategic battle game.\nDragon's Trick by Mark Kale - A trick-taking game for 3 to 6 players. \nPentawar by Ken Shannon - A strategic tableau building battle royale game for 3 to 5 players.\nThe Lost Dragon by David Short - A deduction game for 2 to 4 players.\nDon't Poke the Dragon! by Mike Gurley - A 2 to 5 player push-your-luck game for families and children.\nDragon Scat by Robert Burke - A family-style bluffing game.\nPublic Domain Games - We have converted many family-friendly public domain games that can be played with the Book of Dragons system.\nPlus more, with more to come!\n\nA note on testing: Each game has been put through multiple rounds of testing, and blind play testing with diverse groups totaling 29 people, regardless of designer pedigree, or individual designer play testing routines. Ken Shannon is our lead developer spearheading these efforts. After each session, feedback is collected, including having each player rank each of the games played on a scale of 1 to 10. Blind play testers are not provided the names of the designers in order to eliminate any possibility of bias. Games that do not exceed an average score of 7 in blind play testing are sent back through the development cycle. As of the launch of this Kickstarter, 15 of the 25 games we have in hand exceed an average score of 7. We will continue to develop the remaining games until they exceed an average rating of 7, and will work on new entries in the same manner.  However, we will not delay the production of Book of Dragons due to development. Games that do not meet our quality standards by the time we go to print may not be included in a physical rulebook, but instead, will be released digitally once development is complete. We are confident we will launch with a minimum of 18 games.\nKickstarter has launched an exciting new initiative called \"Commissions,\" and we're really excited about it as Book of Dragons is a true community endeavor!\nHere's how it works:\nAfter you back the project at any level, you are welcome to submit your own design for inclusion in Book of Dragons! We will pick the top 2 games created. These 2 games will be included in the final physical product (as long as their average blind play testing scores are 7 or higher), and you will receive a design credit. Please note, submissions will have hard deadlines to ensure we stay on track to our timelines, any selected design that does not meet deadlines will be released digitally only. For games created that are not selected for inclusion in the physical game, we will include them on the Book of Dragons website and on the game's BGG page. Don't want to design a game, but have a design idea? Share it with the community here, and it might just happen!\nWant to test out our games before you pledge? Want a tool to help you design your own game for the system? You can find it at Tabletopia.com, where Book of Dragons is free to use online until we publish the physical game. Click our banner below to play and/or design!\n  Want to test it out in the physical world? The Book of Dragons deck includes 4 copies of 10 different dragons, so you can easily create a prototype to test your designs with a standard deck of cards. Just remove the Jacks, Queens, Kings and Jokers. Odd and even numbers can represent Good and Evil dragons. Your ruleset should use our Style Guide, and must be posted on our BGG page and/or provided as a link in the Comments of this Kickstarter page.  Need help? Commission us to have one of our designers design a game for you! If you want to select a specific designer, it will be contingent on their agreement, so please contact us first.\nThe deadline to be considered for inclusion in the final physical first edition of the game is January 31st, 2018. There is no deadline for inclusion of your ruleset on our website.\n                           IMPORTANT: For this campaign, add-ons for additional games of Book of Dragons are only available for the Deluxe pledge level . If you have pledged for 4x or more Retail copies, please contact orders@greyfoxgames.com for pricing information on additional copies of the game.\nIf you are new to Kickstarter, the add-ons are the most confusing thing in terms of pledging since they do not work on a \"cart\" system like everything else does on the internet. In order to \"purchase\" an Add-on, simply add the cost of the add-on(s) you would like to your pledge amount.\nExample 1: You live in the US and you chose the Deluxe pledge ($40 w/ shipping included) and want to add a Tuck Box version of the game ($9). You would add $9 to your pledge as there is no increased shipping charge in the US for a total of $49.  \nExample 2: You live in Canada and chose the Deluxe pledge ($48 w/ shipping included) and want to add a Retail version of the game ($16). You would add $18 to your pledge to account for the increased shipping charge for a total of $66.\nAt some point after the campaign, we will send you an email with a link to the pledge manager, in here you will \"spend\" that extra money you pledged letting us know what add-ons you wanted before we ship your stuff.\nAdditional Tuck Box version of Book of Dragons +$8 per copy\nShipping costs (per copy)\nUSA - Free\nEuropean Union - $1\nCanada - $1\nAustralia - $1\nRest of the World - $2\nAdditional Retail version of Book of Dragons +$16 per copy\nShipping costs (per copy)\nUSA - Free\nEuropean Union - $2\nCanada - $2\nAustralia - $2\nRest of the World - $3\nAdditional Deluxe version of Book of Dragons +$30 per copy\nShipping costs (per copy)\nUSA - Free\nEuropean Union - $3\nCanada - $3\nAustralia - $3\nRest of World - $4\nWe have zero interest in putting out a product with sub-par components, so we have planned Book of Dragons to be a high quality product right out of the gate. The cards will be 300gsm, blackcore, linen-finished, and coated!\n                 Fulfillment:\nOur fulfillment partners\n  We will be using Quartermaster Logistics for Book of Dragons fulfillment. They are experts in ensuring tabletop games are packed with care, and professionally shipped. Shipping centers in different parts of the world will be utilized to ship Book of Dragons to our backers. This reduces customs fees, and eliminates VAT for you! \n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risks to delivering by the deadline include:\n\n-Unexpected redesign due to regulatory, manufacturing quality or color issues \n-Shipping and logistical issues \n-Natural disasters / acts of God \n-Unexpected issues with our manufacturer or distributor\n-Although our goal is to ship Book of Dragons with 18 completed games in the box, there is a risk some games will not meet our quality standards, and will be excluded. At the time of launch, we have 15 games that meet our quality standard, and we are confident we will hit 18 or more. But this is dependent on feedback from our blind play testing sessions.

I believe it is fate that has brought us together.\u201d\n- Pat \"Piper\" Lee, creator\nOn this rise, the heroes meet, their lives entwine and their bond eternal...\nCrossroads of Heroes is a strategic board game designed for 2-5 players and it takes approximately 45-90 minutes to play.\nYou start the game as a virtuous martial arts hero/ heroine and your goal is to win renown in the Jianghu to ultimately become the Grand Master of Wulin.\nIn this basic core game, there are five characters for you to choose from, each a member from one of the five most respected sects of Wulin.\nThe five sects are Emei \uff08\u5ce8\u5d4b\uff09, Shaolin \uff08\u5c11\u6797\uff09, Beggar \uff08\u4e10\u5e6b\uff09, Wudang \uff08\u6b66\u7576\uff09 and Kunlun \uff08\u5d11\u5d19\uff09.\nEach character will have his/ her own set of character abilities, sect special items, fighting techniques and signature technique based on a distinctive sect philosophy and can play quite differently from the rest.\nRenown is earned from winning duels, exploring the Jianghu or employing the various stratagems that are available to you in the game.\nThere are 3 main types of stratagems - Dark (Yin), Balance (Taiji) and Light (Yang).\nPlayers who opt for a treacherous type of play may choose to turn evil and then take on a dark path to victory. They will no longer be in contention to become the next Grand Master of Wulin. Instead, they must rely on their own evil scheme and murderous plot to win the game. They would become the hated evil scum of the Jianghu!\nTurning evil will not only change your appearance, your special ability and base wugong will be altered as well!\nAnd if you are really confident, you can seek out one of the five Masters of Wulin and challenge them to a martial arts duel. Defeating any one of the Masters will not only bring you fame and glory, but you will be rewarded with the secret manuals that will unlock their powerful fighting techniques to you.\nWith every 200 backers, the mysterious identity of each Wulin Master will be revealed right here!\nThe journey to heroic greatness has been prepared for you, only now you must choose your own path...\n(This campaign is for the English version of \u201cCrossroads of Heroes\u201d. However, every card in the game has full Chinese text and is therefore fully comprehensible to a Chinese speaker. Furthermore, we also have plans to release Chinese, French and German digital rule-books on our website in the future, to coincide with the game's release.)\nThe first part of the English Game Manual (draft version) is now available. Click on the image above to download it.\nExclusive Kickstarter Content - Some upgraded game components, when unlocked in the Stretch Goals, will be exclusive to the Kickstarter version. (Although a leftover supply may be sold at conventions.)\nClassic Wuxia Theme - If you love classic Wuxia or the age-old struggle between good and evil, there's a good chance that you will like this game. So why wait?\nBe A Part Of Us - You can choose to become a member of your favorite sect! Your name will be recorded in the Hall of Heroes (on our website) so we will always remember you as being one of us!\nThe Evil Sect expansion adds a sixth character into the game. Whoever chooses to play as this character will start the game as an evil character and must destroy his opponents mercilessly or lure them to the side of evil!\nWatch this Evil Sect Expansion trailer and share it with your friends! The future state of the Jianghu and its survival may very well depend on it!\nThe following rewards contain special hand-made items and have a very limited availability! You do not have to pay any extra for shipping. We will package everything ourselves with our own personal touch and the package will be sent to you via the speediest courier!\nAdditional Details:\nThe notebook is a traditional Chinese-styled notebook that emulates the \"Emei Sect Signature Technique Manual\" in the game.

Nick has been very helpful and quick to answer our questions. And the fact that their head office is located in Hong Kong makes communication ever so easy and hassle-free.\nThe list of games that Ninox Games have manufactured include Bethel Woods, Burger Up, Butterfly Garden, C.O.G., Cosmic Run, Cultists of Cthulhu and Entropy.\nGiven Ninox Games's experience and stout leadership, I feel quite confident that we will have a great work relationship with them and that Crossroads of Heroes's final product quality will benefit from it.\nMost of our shipments will ship direct from Hong Kong by air because this gives us better control and will minimize the chances for delays and damages.\n\nWe understand that this will increase shipping costs and we apologize. To show our sincerity, we\u2019ve chosen to absorb HK$50-HK$100 of the shipping costs!\n\nWe offer friendly shipping to all the countries in the table below.\nUnfortunately, shipping is a very complicated affair when you are shipping globally, especially for new creators like us who have very limited resources.\nWe have tried very hard to reduce the costs of shipping for everyone. However, we just cannot afford to pay for all the taxes and duties for everyone. All we could do is absorb some of the shipping fees for you.\nIf you are not sure what the exact shipping cost for your country is, just make a pledge on a level that you like and it will be calculated for you.\n Favorite Sect to play as and why?\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to choose. But if I really have to, it has to be Beggar Sect. (Although Wudang Sect and Evil Sect come close.) I guess there is something about being able to draw from the items discard pile that I find to be quite irresistable, haha.\u201d\n Favorite Sect to play as and why?\n\u201cI guess Emei Sect, but not because she is the only playable female character in the game. More importantly, she has the \u201cSpeed\u201d ability, which makes wandering the Jianghu easier and more risk free. Unfortunately, I cannot have that same luxury when traveling in the real world.\u201d\nWe also wish to give thanks to our family and friends who supported us and helped by playtesting our game! For a complete list of these people, please visit the credits page of our website.\nPat Piper is a company founded in 2014.

Your host lies slumped in a chair, as dead as an actor portraying a doornail. The Detective finally whirls around and jabs a finger in the air. \"J'accuse!\"\n\nMurder Most Foul is an infinitely replayable murder mystery dinner party game. You and your friends will get together, where one of you will be the Host - the one to get murdered - one will be the Detective, who tries to solve the murder, and the rest will be Guests, who compete to kill the Host and get away with it. One of the ways you can murder someone is by \"poisoning\" them by spiking their food or drink with hot sauce - so we partnered with FYM Hot Sauce to make a custom hot sauce for the game, called Poison - their hottest hot sauce ever. (it's also really delicious)\nMurder Most Foul is a game for 4 or more players, and plays best with 6-10. It takes 2-3 hours to play. Murder Most Foul doesn't run off a script, but instead a set of goals, which means that no two games are ever the same, even if you play with the same scenario. The murder happens during the game, and the Detective will need to use their real life deductive abilities to solve the crime, using whatever evidence is actually at hand.\nNothing is predetermined: you have to do it yourself. MMF is infinitely replayable - with this one book, you'll have a lifetime supply of murder mysteries. And given the murders, more than one lifetime!\n   More reviews coming soon!\n  Try not to act suspicious\nEach player is given a role - one Host, one Detective, and the rest are Guests. The Host is the one destined to be murdered, the Detective will try to solve the mystery, and the Guests each compete to be the one to murder the Host and get away with it. \nThe role determines your goal - what you try to accomplish during the game. You can also choose to play with the optional Motive rules, which give Guests a random, secret, second goal that involve murdering, framing, stealing from, or assisting another Guest.\nMurder Most Foul is played over the course of an evening, during which you will:\nCommit the Murder - the murder happens during the game, not before it. Players compete to be the one to commit the murder. There are two ways you can commit the murder - either finding a hidden murder weapon, like a knife or rope, or by \"poisoning\" another player. We've partnered with FYM Hot Sauce to make the official MMF \"Poison\" hot sauce - their hottest sauce ever!\n\nSolve a Real Mystery - the Detective has to actually solve the mystery of who committed the murder. Since one of the Guests commits the murder during the game, there are no pre-written clues to go off - the Detective will have to actually use their wits, powers of observation, and deductive skills to solve the crime. The Detective will have to see who was where when, what weapon the crime was committed with, and any other clues they can notice. Whoever gets accused loses, so the action doesn't end when the murder is committed - everyone, even the innocent bystanders, will need to throw the Detective off their scent (or onto someone else's) to avoid being accused.\nCooperate, Sabotage, and Frame Each Other - Guests can work together or compete to be the one to commit the murder. Innocent guests might work with the Detective to solve the crime, and others might try to frame one another, or just to try to get away with their crime at any cost. Optional Motive rules give Guests additional goals they must complete together - framing, assisting, stealing from, or even murdering each other.\n  Photo courtesy of The Review Board\n  Also from The Review Board\n  This photo's by me, which is why it isn't as good as the ones above\nMurder Most Foul is a slim paperback tome filled with rules, scenarios, and food & drink recipes. The game is accompanied by Poison, an exclusive hot sauce made by Dane Wilcox of FYM Hot Sauce.\nEvery backer who pledges at at least the Junior Gumshoe level gets a PDF of the complete book. Back at the Detective level or higher and you'll get a softcover copy of the book as well, shipped anywhere in the world!* The book has:\nComplete rules for how to play\nFive scenarios, each with a meal and cocktail recipe:\nA Dark and Stormy Night, by Thomas Eliot\nMurder at Dowry Manor, by Tania Fordwalker\nThe Black Gold Conspiracy, by Joshua Scott Thomas\nThe Don's Last Supper, by George Kemper\nDie-In Fishing Resort, by Mitchell Gallinger\nAnd one we'll design with you, if you back at the Murder Victim level!\nBack at the Prime Suspect level or higher and you'll also get a bottle of Poison hot sauce, or you can add it on to any other pledge for $15. Poison is made with tons of fresh ingredients, including, appropriately enough, bushels of ghost peppers, one of the hottest peppers in the world.\n\nYou also have the opportunity to add Sixpence Games' previous two titles, Professor Pugnacious and Cultists of Cthulhu, to any pledge level. \n\n(NOTE: Poison hot sauce is not actually poisonous, though it does have quite a kick)\n*you will get a code that you will then use on DriveThruRPG to get your copy made and sent to you at cost - a few dollars more. Think of it as being $20 plus shipping and handling. If you live outside the USA and want a bottle of hot sauce, it'll also cost a little bit extra, otherwise the $15 covers both the sauce and the shipping for the sauce\n      Murder Most Foul is a game by Sixpence Games. MMF was designed by Thomas Eliot and illustrated by Nicholas Small, and is the third game from Sixpence Games. Our previous two games, both made here on Kickstarter, are Professor Pugnacious and Cultists of Cthulhu. The scenarios were written by the winners of the Sixpence Games Writing Contest: Tania Fordwalker, Joshua Scott Thomas, George Kemper, and Mitchell Gallinger.\nPoison is a hot sauce by FYM Hot Sauce, who have previously run kickstarters for their Original and Planktown IPA sauces. Poison was designed by Dane Wilcox and is his hottest sauce yet.  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my third project here at Sixpence Games, so I have a pretty good handle on things now.

The only thing that could possibly cause a delay is if folks back at the Murder Victim level, so we have to write more scenarios - and then that just means you're getting more bang for your buck!\n\nDane over at FYM Hot Sauce has a lot of experience making really great hot sauces and fulfilling his own kickstarters for them, and he's already made one batch of the Poison Hot Sauce, so we don't expect any difficulties there either.

FULL CAMPAIGN NOTES below.\n Standard Crate Runic Box coming soon.\n New Ammo Boxes Added - Army Green Locker Box Design in Progress.\n*Many thanks to August Hahn for inspiring the Skinny Bar concept.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCAMPAIGN UPDATES: (Oldest to newest)\n(1) Thank you very much for your support and generosity, the DCF is now 100%+ Funded and the Molten Steel has begun to POUR into the 35 Stretch Goals! : The SG Graphic has been relocated below and will be updated to show SG progress every 48 Hours. Showcase Coins will be situated just underneath and caches uploaded every Monday(except the 26th Dec) and Friday (16th/23rd/30th) - with the collection updated as bi-weekly updates are posted. \n(2) New Custom Coin Design Add-On: After some consideration I have decided to open up a $5 per custom coin design option to backers. Just work out how many coins you want me to make you, times it by five and add that much to your pledge. If you pledge for the Exclusive Custom Coin DCF then you can get an unlimited amount of extra custom coin designs for $5 each on top of the free coins your pledge offers. Non-exclusive pledges can get up to 20 extra custom coins designed for $5 each.\n(3) I have now unlocked the Custom Printed Boxed Set options from $100 to $450 AUD.  Please See Rewards and \"Add-Ons\" (below) for more details. Some backers have reported difficulty adding extra funds to their pledge: to remedy this I have created a number of new pledges that include the 99 Digital Showcase Coins as well as Digital Pledges specifically for the Exclusive Tier that may wish to upgrade to get a printed set with their Custom Coins. Custom Coins can be included as part of or entirely make up printed sets. This does create an awful lot of pledge levels - but hopefully they are straight-forward and allow you to get what you want if you are experiencing difficulty just adding extra funds to your pledge. If you are Not experiencing difficulty increasing your pledge manually you can add extra printed sets of coins/ammo tokens or custom coin-adds on to your pledge manually by adding the appropriate funding. Please see the changed 'PRINTED COINS' section for cost details and shipping.\n(4) The former Max Stretch Goal at 4k has become obsolete: I have since replaced it with an offer of 50 Extra Showcase Coin Designs to be added to all kits.

I have previously run four successful campaigns (100% completed - campaign details in Risks section) and this time I am bringing you Everything you need to easily put together tens of thousands of different types of your own custom design RPG coins at home with this massive Digital Coin Forge. \n As a gamer and a problem solver, my focus on innovation is to deliver ways of doing things that require minimal work that anyone can learn to use within minutes. With this specially designed kit you can rapidly put THOUSANDS of coin styles together in dozens of materials/metal textures and print as many as you need. And most importantly - customize them to include YOUR names, locations, persons, dates and denominations and details that fit any of your RPG worlds. All you need is Photoshop/GIMP or another artistic program that uses layers and my kit supplies the rest. My guide will teach you in minutes how to easily assemble thousands of designs custom made for any game you're running so you can print out as many custom-made coins as you need.\nWhile there are some companies that print RPG currencies and metal coins - None of them offer you the ability to CUSTOMIZE the coins to suit your world like the Digital Coin Forge does. With my digital design kit, in just a few minutes you can craft sets of coins to print in specific colours/textures/styles/shapes/sizes/fonts and put the names and images of your Kings, your Fantasy Lands/Worlds, your Year Dates, your Denominations or even your or custom Faces on them where you want them when you want them. Isn't it time people knew you were King? \n\"Spanish Quinta\"\nWhether you want ancient tarnished copper bits, dwarvish hexen coins, gleaming pirate doubloons, futuristic space credits, bars of gold, currencies in bone, wood, jade, coins of all kinds in more than a dozen metals including classics such as platinum, electrum, gold, silver, bronze and copper and up to 50+ different base textures, embedded with precious gems or even ring-shaped currencies - the Digital Coin Forge will give you all the designs and instructions you need to print a dragons ransom at home on your printer.\nThe Digital Coin Forge (DCF) is a massive set of digital layers in a set of 3 single files called 'factories'. The primary factory controls the basic bones and appearance of the coin (i.e. the coins shape and overall base design): the secondary factory controls textures (i.e. gilding, material, colour, appearance): and the third factory allows you to add various denominations to your finalized coin. Through the DCF you can control a huge assortment of textures, borders, shaped templates, icons, symbols, shapes and activate each layer with the click of a button. Most of the work is done for you leaving it to you to choose from the Forge the details you want to forge the perfect coin. \n The DCF offers numerous kinds of base shapes from Hex, Round, Square, Triangle, Rectangle in more than a dozen metals and a huge variety of other coin materials to fit any RPG style including wood, bone, gem, jade, element, blood, rust, verdigris, skin, ceramic, clay, stone and a vast array of textures to put together stunning new variations. The DCF can also be used to craft tokens, poker chips, markers, chits, gems and game pieces.\nThrough my Digital Forge Guide (The Numinomicon) I will show you techniques to emboss, gild, texture, age, tone, shadow, brighten your coins and add neat effects to give added realism - and through Stretch Goals add a mix of potentially more than 100 new templates, icons, textures and designs so you can make virtually hundreds of thousands of different coins with a forge equipped well enough to forge any kind of coin.\nBecause the size of the coin templates are approximately 1.25\" In XCF/GIMP format it's an extremely compact toolkit and approximately 30mb.\n$25 AUD gets you a massive DIGITAL COIN FORGE with:\nAll Unlocked Stretch Goals.\n75 assorted decoration templates to easily design beautiful and ornate Round, Square, Triangle, Hex, Rectangle-shaped coins.\n12 borders with runic/glyphic inscription templates in various shapes.\n24 material texture types including bone, jade, copper, silver, gold, electrum, platinum, steel, rusted, wooden and more.\n24 image stamps/icons to decorate/theme your coins.\nAny 1 Free Font: Add that mysterious edge to your coins by choosing and using one of my personally designed alien/ancient race fonts to decorate them.\n3 Free Custom Text Rings with your choice of Wording to personalize your coins with.\nA Detailed PDF Instruction Guide on using your Digital Coin Forge.\nOption to purchase Add-ons\nAccess to the Printed Treasure Hoard Add-on if unlocked.\n\"100 piece Thrim\"\n  $45 AUD gets you the Master Digital Coin Forge with loads of extras. \nAll Unlocked Stretch Goals.\n125 assorted decoration templates to easily design beautiful and ornate Round, Square, Hex, Rectangle, Triangle, Oval, Crescent, Diamond, Ring & Gemstone.\n24 borders with runic/glyphic inscription templates for various shapes.\n50 material texture types including bone, jade, copper, silver, gold, electrum, platinum, steel, rusted, wooden and more.\n50 image stamps/icons to decorate/theme your coins. \n24 Assorted Round / Square / Hex Plain-Text Borders with Latin and English phrases such as 'Order of the Realm', 'Peace & Plenty' - 'In the Reign of His Majesty the King' - 'Novus Ordo Seclorum' - 'Dei Gratia' etc.\nAny 2 Free Fonts: Add that mysterious edge to your coins by using three of my personally designed alien/ancient race fonts to decorate them. \nA Detailed PDF Instruction Guide on using your Digital Coin Forge.\nAccess to Alternate Design Templates for you to print your own Box to hold your coins.\nYour name as a backer on the Box Template. \nOption to purchase Add-ons\nAccess to the Printed Treasure Hoard Add-on: includes plastic pirate doubloons, 3d crystals, gems and boxed or printed set(s) of coins.\n5 Free Custom Text Rings with your choice of Wording.\nSample Letters Shown\n   $75 AUD buys one of the EXCLUSIVE CUSTOM Digital Coin Forges:\n(1) The Illumined Custom Digital Forge is for those of you seeking a personal touch to your coins.

The Ammo Box will also differ from the Treasure Hoard by using a specially printed 'bullet' shaped token for full-length smaller rounds and concentrate on making use of specific munition-appropriate tokens.   The Box Template is currently underway. You can make up your Ammo Box from the pictured Showcase Munitions below.\nThe Ammo Box comes with:  \n[A] 200 x 0.25x0.75\" \"bullet\" shaped printed rounds. (Choose any of the 2 dozen available types in Box A2 (coming soon) up to 200) \n[B] 80 x 1x2\" rectangles shaped printed tokens that can be made up of various Shotgun Shells inc H.E / Rifle Rounds / Ammo Clips for Handguns / Rockets / Tank Shells / TNT Sticks / Miniature Fully-Loaded Ammo Crates / Plastic Explosives \n [C] 150 x 1\" round printed tokens that can be made up of Any of the A1 Box Bullet Casings (see picture above), or Buckshot, Cannon Balls, Grenades, Bullet Holes. \n[D] 150 x 0.75\" round printed tokens that can also be made up any of the items listed in [C] \n[E] 60 x 1.25\" round printed tokens that can also be made up any of the items listed in [C] \n[F] 280 x 0.5\" round printed tokens that can also be made up any of the items listed in [C] \n[G] Four x 4x8\" Sample Bullet dry/wet erase bandolier / belt / cyclinder templates printed on 0.65\" chipboard covered with a matt finish.\nBox A1\n The A1 Box represents end-on casings/shells in 18 different styles that you can choose. You can get these in 1.25\" / 1\" / 0.75\" / 0.5\" sizes. You can get as many different types as you want to fill up your token quantity. So if you have 40 round 1\" tokens in your Ammo Box you might get 12 x D3, 12 x A3 and 16 x E3 making a total of 40. If you want more you can add extra tokens in set quantities and sizes to your pledge using the ADD-ONS.\nBox A2\nThe large bullet graphic over the SeeleyOne Munitions sticker shows a steel bullet with a just visible black background. The new bullet tokens can be filled entirely with a bullet leaving no or little background pending on the bullet you choose - some handgun bullets fill the token neatly but slimmer bullets and rifle rounds will have more background. All bullets (G-N) are printed on the same size token. Just as with Box A1 you can get as many of the different types as you want to fill up your token allowance. Shotgun shells are printed on the 1x2\" Rectangles and will have a fair amount of black background.\nBox A3\n Box A3 offers Cannon Balls / Buckshot for Pirate, Medieval, Naval, Frontier, Western type games and these can be printed on any of the available round sizes. Q-1 is a 2x2\" Square Rifle Clip with 5 rounds. Q-2 is a 1x2\" Rectangle Rifle Clip with 10 Rounds. You can get these Q clips with any of the Rifle Round designs you like. The R sections offers 1x2\" Rectangle Tokens featuring Old Steel Magazine with Black Background. A newer Steel Magazine with White Background. A Handgun Bullet Clip: You can get these clips with any of the Bullet Round designs you like. An Enclosed Scratched Metal Clip with Visible Vertical Round Sighting An Enclosed Metal Clip with Curved Visible Round Sighting An Open neatly Arranged Ammo Box, Open Messy Ammo Box Closed Ammo Box. Open Ammo Boxes, X-Ray magazines can be filled with any Ammo Type.\nBox A4\n Finally - Box A4 has some extra tokens featuring Two Types of Grenade that can be chosen for any round token. Two Types of Rocket / Missile and A Single and Quad-Pack of Torpedoes (Rockets can also be made Quad). There is a 2x2\" Square pack of Dynamite and a 1x2\" Single Stick Dynamite Token. The V - are actually 4x8\" printed templates that I have put together. V1 represents a 6-cyclinder handgun onto which can be placed 1\"/ 0.75\" handgun bullets from Box A1. It also has a dry/wet erase set of general text fields and boxes that you can use to mark down details for the gun. Possibly ideal for Western Games. V2 and V3 are to be used as generic Bullet Belts / Bandoliers over which 1\" and 0.75\" tokens might be placed to indicate shots left in a weapon. The V Templates come in a set of FOUR, with four V1 on one side, and 2 x V2 and 2 x V3 on the other.  \nAll of these Boxes contain tokens that are labelled - you just tell me what designs you want in your token quantity. I.e. you might want some missiles, some rockets, some torpedos and some bullets. At the current moment the Ammo Box gives you 200 'bullet' tokens so you could get 50 of each, as an example. I will create a final Ammo Box and post it on the 30th with the reverse side of the tokens you can choose if required, it could be plain red, yellow, black or white and be dry/wet erasable so you can change the denomination at will. Or it might have fields or circles - let me know what you guys need/want. But I will try to come up with a variety of other designs to suit. A late addition to the Ammo Box will be Arrows/Bolts in various design types including explosive, fire and possibly a quiver in the 1x2\" range.\n Please note you can also add $5 to your pledge per extra custom bullet you wish me to design just as you can with the coins. \nI will also make add-ons in the above quantities available to backers to add to your box OR to add to your Treasure Hoard.\nBesides the ton of existing templates I want to make it possible to further expand your Forge by unlocking extra coin/texture templates and there are TWO ways to do this:\nWay the First : Stretch Goals. Your donated coins will be melted down into hot slurry and used for making new custom templates and textures! - the more pledges we get the bigger everyone's kit. Help pour the metal into the new coin molds by pledging and unlock a huge variety of extra free different types of Coin & Texture template for your kit with up to TEN (10) Templates/Textures added per Stretch Goal. All of which can be used in the Digital Coin Forge to add new flourishes and details and make extra cool coins \nWay the Second : Showcase Coins. During the campaign I will be making and displaying '99 Showcase Coins' : 99 random coin designs that I will make during the campaign to illustrate the depth and variety of coins that can be made with the Digital Coin Forge. These coins will be compiled into bi-weekly posts and include any new Stretch Goal textures/designs that are unlocked to show off the features they add to designs. For just a little extra on your pledge (+$25 AUD) you can get all of my digital designs for the Showcase Coins as one gigantic add-on. I have added numbers & names to the showcase coins for ease of reference.  If we reach 4k I will add a further 50 Showcase Coin Designs to the existing 99.\nStretch Goals include dozens of exciting new templates and textures in a huge variety of themes plus Ingot Templates so you can create bars of steel, iron, bronze, copper, silver, gold and more using dozens of pressed Ingot designs and Jewelled Coin Templates to add the wealthy lustre of encrusted gems to your coins using dozens of jewelled templates that will be added as a bonus to all digital kits. Even if the extra cool Ingots are not unlocked there is a standard set of printed bars and coins available known as 'Basic Press' to make up your Hoard with.\nShowcase Coin Files are supplied as merged PNG's with no denomination. \n[Edit: Dec 15th / Day 6] Now that I have enough support from backers I can offer to turn the digital coins made into professionally printed cardboard coins in assorted sizes and shapes packaged in a cool looking strongbox for BOTH TREASURE & AMMO/MUNITIONS. I have created a variety of new pledges to choose a custom treasure, ammo (or both) hoard to give the best broadest possible range of options. You can now also expand any given set with add-on treasures per box such as miniature Crystal Clusters, Glass Gems and Faceted Jewels - extra coins -extra bullets - and even make up a custom mixed set made of Ammo and Treasure. \nMix and Match Coins to fill up the require token quantity with either Showcase Coins, Custom Designs, or Munition Designs.\nChoose the Printed Box Design you Want. \nCreate your own perfect treasure hoard with hundreds of coins suited to a variety of your favourite games.  AND you can do the same with the AMMO BOX.\nThere is also a massive 1200+ pc Random Hoard set available.\nCheck out these add-on Extras.

Because we're mice.\nIn our first challenge, we try to raise a mouse army to face the cat head-on, but more and more of our would-be recruits are overcome with fear and sneak away. Now for our second challenge we decide to lure the cat into a trap, but it's all going badly. We're scattered across the farmyard, unsure of what to do next, when we hear a foreboding yowl. The cat is loose.\nIt's time to see if we succeed or fail. We gather the stones, hold our breath, and get ready to draw\u2026\nFollow is a game where you sit down with your friends and play characters working together to achieve a common goal: your quest.\nThe quest you pick decides the kind of game you'll play. You could start a rebellion, cure a disease, slay a dragon (or a cat), or get your candidate elected. If it's something people can work together to accomplish, it could be a quest.\nWill your characters stay united or will their differences tear them apart? Will they triumph or will their hopes go up in flames?\nI made Follow because it's the game I wanted to have in my bag.\nFor the last six years I've run a public gaming group, Story Games Seattle, and every week I sit down and game with random people. Often total strangers. Often people who have never tried role-playing games before. We sit down for a few hours, forge an epic and surprising story together, then exchange glorious high-fives and walk off into the night.\nBut you need the right tools to make that work. We have a lot of great games, but I wanted a flexible, easy-to-learn game that I could always whip out at a moment's notice and play. A game that provided structure and useful prompts but emphasized role-playing and didn't stand in the way of the contributions of the players.\nI also wanted a game with massive replay value \u2013 something you could play over and over again without feeling like you were treading old ground or getting bored. A game that could keep surprising and exciting you week after week. I designed Microscope and Kingdom, and while both are great games, both have their limitations. Microscope has a very specific (even unusual) style, and Kingdom creates excellent drama but has a definite learning curve.\nFollow is designed to hit all these targets: fast, easy, replayable, and most of all, fun. Very fun. Lots of people are already playing it, and now I want to share it with you.\nLearning role-playing games isn't as easy as it should be, so I also wanted Follow to be a perfect way to introduce new people to the hobby. Never tried role-playing games before? Follow has your back. Already into role-playing but want an easy system to introduce new people? Again, Follow has your back.\nFollow has no game master and nothing to prepare. All the steps are clearly and carefully laid out so, even if you've never seen a role-playing game before, if you have some people and some time, you're ready to play.\nSo how does Follow work? The backbone of your game is the quest you pick. It gets everyone on the same page about the kind of story you're creating so you can start playing quickly.\n'People working together to accomplish a goal' covers a huge range of possibilities, so Follow quests do too. You can settle a new planet with the Colony or try to rocket your band to the top of the charts in the Music. Win an election and get the Candidate into office or put on your lab coat and fight a disease in the Cure. Play the Gods and make mortals worship you or try to unite the Superheroes as a team to protect society and bust some heads.\nQuests are built to be flexible and powerful. Each has a default setting, but the game is designed so you can take one and drop it into whatever environment you like. Want to play Rebel spies stealing the plans to the Death Star? Whip out the Heist. By default it\u2019s a modern-day robbery, but you could just as easily go after Imperial secrets. I've seen the Posse played as UN investigators tracking down a rogue artificial intelligence, the Dragon as Norse seafarers hunting a kraken, and the Rebellion with plucky 4th graders fighting back against the 5th graders who bully them. So long as the goal of the quest stays the same, you can jump into any setting that interests you.\nWe used nearly a dozen quests in the playtest, but there are so many more possibilities. I'm still fine-tuning the perfect mix to include in the final book. I'll talk more about that in the weeks ahead.\nTo complete your quest, you confront a series of challenges. Each success makes you more likely to win the quest and each failure makes it harder... but not impossible.\nThe challenges you choose determine what kind of story you're telling, so you can play the same quest over and over again and have a completely different experience each time. You could play a Heist that was all about casing the joint and crafting a cunning plan, another that was all car chases and gun fights, or one that was all about lying low until the heat blows over and you figure out who ratted you out to the cops. They're all heists, but even though they're totally different flavors of heists, one quest template can do them all.\nThere's a moment I've seen in Follow over and over again: we've gathered our stones and we're ready to draw to see if we win or lose the challenge. Everyone's attention is riveted. Everyone's breath is held. And then we draw\u2026 and everyone screams. Sometimes it's a cheer of victory. Sometimes it's a cry of relief. Other times it's a wail of defeat.\nYou might think that in a game about completing a quest that winning is good and losing is bad, but Follow is about the characters \u2013 the decisions they make and what they care about. It's designed so that seeing our characters lose is just as interesting and exciting as seeing them win. Even when we groan in defeat, we're enjoying the tragedy that unfolds just like any great story. The characters may lose, but the players never do.\nWant to know more? Check the updates to learn about creating your fellowship, picking challenges and drawing stones, and that delicious risk of betrayal\u2026\nI started working on Follow in 2013, and it's been playtested by over a hundred people all around the world. The pictures on this page are from just a handful of those games.\nThe good news is that the game is ready to play \u2013 right now. And if you back Follow, not only will you get the final version on the date shown in the rewards, you'll get an early access version after this Kickstarter closes, long before the final release date. You'll be playing Follow months before it's available anywhere else.\nI'm having a lot of fun of playing Follow, but I want to get it out into the world because I want more people to play and have great games. It's as simple as that. With your support, we'll make that happen.\n\"Follow is a dream come true for facilitators. The rules are straightforward and super easy to explain, so when you're running it you can also be a full participant. It's my new go-to for games with first-time players.\" \u2013Caroline Hobbs\n\"It\u2019s a subtle game. The mechanics are deceptively simple and on reading it, I found it a bit shallow. On playing it, however, I found it deep.\" \u2013Simon Pettersson\n\"Follow is streamlined fun! Three acts to establish whether your quest will end in success or, even better, failure!\" \u2013Adrienne Mueller\n\"It really gave me perspective on the differences between player and character, honestly one of my favorite and most intense gaming experiences in a while. I was at the edge of my seat until the very end\" \u2013Patrick McCabe\n\"Follow puts the human back in the heart of your quests. And that's no mean feat!\" \u2013Wauthoz Bastien\n\"You can be Space President! You can be DOUBLE Space President! WHAT ELSE DO YOU NEED TO KNOW!\" \u2013Eric Olson\n\"Follow is yet another beautifully written, polished knockout piece of design from Ben Robbins.\" \u2013Noel Warford\n\"Follow is a triumph! It creates the strongest narrative experiences of any story game I've ever played.\"  \u2013Jeff Slater\n\"Ramps up the tension from the start by building characters that have cause for infighting.\" \u2013Andrew Hamilton\n\"Follow is a game that reminds me of all the best AND worst team projects I've ever been a part of.\" \u2013Marc Hobbs\n\"Follow helps you tell poignant stories. The mechanics are light enough to get out of the way when you don't need them but present enough to introduce meaningful emotional twists. While playing Follow at a Con with a group of strangers, the end of our story was enough to bring a tear to my eyes.\" \u2013Noah Cohen", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my third Kickstarter and fourth book release (after Microscope, Kingdom and Microscope Explorer), so I know how to get the job done.\n\nThe rules are finished, but I'm constantly honing the text so it flows effortlessly at the table.

Our goal was to combine all things we use in our everyday life to be stored in a Duffel Bag. The KAVA bag starts and ends with everyday essentials we drag with us from day to day bases. This bag was designed around the workflows of travelers and commuters, even some essential for photographers. The KAVA comes with a headphone jack opening on the top, the bag itself can be held in several different ways for your comfortably, we also included a small tripod holder and as well as a bottle holder along with a side pocket for extra essentials, last but not least the inside of the bag includes a laptop holder for most laptops. And it doesn't just stop there... \nPhones have became an essential part of our lives and they play a big role on our daily interactions. With introduction of bigger phone sizes, we decided to offer two elastic pockets on the straps that can be used to store phones, wallets or even passports. We tested each elastic pockets with different phone sizes and we have yet to find a problem! The elastic pockets on the straps allows you to quickly grab your phone and wallets without ever worrying about losing them.\nWhen we first started on working on KAVA, we paid a close attention of how people interact with music. We've placed the headphone port in a connivence location for making listening to music more enjoyable in the backpack orientation. Your music player will rest in the inside pocket of the bag. \nThe front flat pocket allows for a quick and grab and go access to things such as cellphones, wallets and small objects. With our broad lifestyles, the front pocket will prove to be handy and personal to each and one of us.\nSide pocket complements the smaller front pocket with more space that allows not only one but few objects to be put in and be zipper for secure carry.\nThis is unique feature that allows for multi-purpose use. The side elastic pocket with two straps will allow you to secure in small tripod or monopod. It can also a secure water bottle. Since the bag can be held and worn differently, the strap holds it in place securely regardless of the orientation of the bag.\nIncludes:\n1 x Front Zipper Pocket\n1 x Side Zipper Pocket\n2 x Handles ( Horizontal and Vertical) \n2 x Strap Elastic Holder (Phone/Wallets)\n1 x Side Multi-Purpose Elastic Holder\n1 x Laptop Inner Pocket\n1 x Small Zipper Pocket \n1 x Backpack Straps\n1 x Shoulder strap\nWe believe with KAVA you can truly discover yourself as it acts as a perfect companion in carrying your everyday essential gear.

But every change has unforeseen consequences. Things don\u2019t go as planned.\nOne faction wants to help humanity reach the stars. They go back to the Cold War and introduce discoveries to accelerate the space race but\u2013surprise!\u2013another player describes how it escalates into a military conflict. Astronauts and cosmonauts battle in orbit and then on the surface of the Moon.\nIn this history, the West falls. Their lunar bases are all that remain. The star-spangled banner yet waves, but where the fifty stars once shined there is now only a single white disc: the Moon, the last stronghold of democracy.\nBut if the Earth cannot be free, should it be left in the hands of their enemies? The defeated patriots look down on their homeworld, fingers poised over the button that will shower the globe with city-smashing moon-rocks. The answer is clear: give me liberty, or give me death!\nOops. Instead of saving the world, we've doomed it. So we go back in time and try again...\nMicroscope Explorer is an expansion that lets you take Microscope in whole new directions. Explore a family tree with UNION. Forge the epic story of a city, a ship or a sword of power in CHRONICLE. Travel back in time and rewrite history in ECHO.\nIt's loaded with tools and strategies to get the most out of all your Microscope games, like SEEDS to get you started playing faster, TECHNIQUES to improve play, and WORLD-BUILDING methods to create settings for other role-playing games.\nEven if you've never played Microscope, this Kickstarter is for you: back a level that includes both books and start making history.\nMicroscope is a game where you sit down and create an epic history, spanning hundreds or thousands of years, all in just a few hours of play. Create cities, nations or whole worlds\u2026 or destroy them.\nYou can defy the limits of time and space, jumping backward or forward to explore the parts of the history that interest you. Want to leap a thousand years into the future and see how an institution shaped society? Want to jump back to the childhood of the king you just saw assassinated and find out what made him such a hated ruler? That\u2019s normal in Microscope.\nCrazy, right? But it works. People play it all around the world. Here are just some of the things people have said about it:\n\"Microscope is incredible! A truly brilliant design.\"\n     \u2013John Harper, designer of Blades in the Dark & Danger Patrol\n\"If you play just one role playing game this century, make Microscope that game.\"\n     \u2013Emily Care Boss, designer of Shooting the Moon & Breaking the Ice\n\"It's been a long time that a game captures my attention like Microscope. Bypass the hype, it's a truly remarkable well-instruction'd game\"\n     \u2013Andy Kitkowski, founder of story-games.com\n\"Microscope is a model of minimalist complexity: with easy-to-learn tools you gain the power to create a believable history that will surprise you even as you're authoring it.\"\n     \u2013Katherine Cross, scholar and gaming critic\n\"Ben Robbins' Microscope may be the clearest-written game text I've ever read - which is helpful, because it is also one of the most innovative games I've come across in a long time.\"\n     \u2013Jason Morningstar, designer of Fiasco\n\"We created the Citizen Kane of spaceship stories\u2026\"\n     \u2013Timothy Young, playing Microscope Chronicle at PAX\nMicroscope Explorer brings you three new spin-off games, each using the core principles of Microscope but with careful adjustments to create different experiences in play:\nUNION turns the Microscope history into a family tree. Go back and explore the lives of the ancestors whose unions brought each new generation into existence and see how the past makes us who we are today. Union creates a tight web of characters and brings their lives and personal decisions into the spotlight.\nCHRONICLE focuses and streamlines Microscope, narrowing the history to the story of a single thing, such as a castle, a city or a sword of power. It also brings individuals to the fore with anchor characters whose lives are intertwined with each chapter of the history. It's a simpler, more personal, Microscope.\nECHO brings time-travel to Microscope. Don't like how the future turned out? Go back and tamper with the past to change it. See how the changes you make echo forward, reshaping your history or utterly destroying it. Winners write the history, but the losers can go back and change it. And if you just want to experiment with alternate histories or \"what if\" scenarios without time travel, Echo includes an option to do that too.\nEach brings a very different flavor to the table. I think Union is my favorite, but if you want to see how Chronicle can turn big history into something intimate and personal, check out the write-up of one of our games, Flight of the Madamas.\nOne of the biggest challenges of playing Microscope isn't making a vast or interesting history, it's narrowing down your choices and picking just one idea for your story from all the infinite possibilities. Explorer includes detailed SEEDS to help you agree on a premise and get started playing more quickly.\nThese new seeds are a huge improvement over the simple prompts included in the original Microscope. Each starts with a core idea and walks you through a simple step-by-step process to customize it. You could play the same seed over and over and get a unique history every time. The book includes a range of seeds including sci-fi, fantasy and real world issues:\nBlood of Monsters: A terrible power runs through the veins of a few, passed from one generation to the next since the deeds that first spawned them. They are mighty overlords, monarchs... or terrors.\nPeak Oil: The gas runs out, bringing the world to a grinding halt. Highways stand empty and airports are silent. Can new energy sources replace the once-plentiful fossil fuels or is cheap energy a thing of the past?\nThe Imperium: The grand Imperium spans ten thousand stars, uniting all humanity beneath the glorious banner of the Omnipotent Astrarch, Emperor of the Void-Throne, Keeper of the Heavens and Sovereign of All Worlds.\nGolems of Eden: Magi fashion artificial servants, but inadvertently create a race of living, feeling beings. Are the golems accepted as equals or enslaved and exploited? Are they children or usurpers of Man?\nAfter Lemuria Sinks: The great island nation has sunk beneath the waves. Wise and terrible Lemuria, that mighty jewel among the nations of the earth, is lost. Fallen. Never to return. Now the young nations are free to forge their own destiny. Will they thrive or will they descend into barbarism without Lemuria\u2019s guidance and tyranny?\nSince Microscope was released, gamers have flocked to it as a WORLD-BUILDING tool to collaboratively create settings for other role-playing games. Now Microscope Explorer gives you step-by-step techniques to translate your history into an environment you can use for your next campaign.\nThe new flavors of Microscope are also excellent tools to bring aspects of your setting to life. Want to develop the backstory of a character? Unleash Union. Want to flesh out the origins of an order of assassins or a sacred relic? Break out Chronicle.\nThere's a lot more the book covers: play advice, using Microscope to reboot your favorite books or movies, plus weird experiments like reincarnation games or split histories. It's packed with things I've learned from playing Microscope over and over again with all sorts of wonderful people.\nBut I need your support to make it happen. If you've never tried Microscope, now's your chance to start building your own epic histories. And if you already love Microscope, you can help make it even better. Shout it to the world and show gamers everywhere what they are missing!\nStretch goals unveils a new tool to get your Microscope games started: ORACLES let you generate random seeds for your history. You can use them to spark your imagination and come up with unexpected starting points for your game.\n$18,000 -- REACHED!\nTo the Stars (Oracle): Generates seeds for interstellar histories. Elements like radical tech breakthrus, alien artifacts, synthetic life, post-human evolution, colonization, galactic war and Humanity's never-ending struggle to adapt to new and strange environments.\n$23,000 -- REACHED!\nSwords & Sorcery (Oracle): Creates fantasy history seeds. Dragon hordes hidden in crooked towers. Feuding kingdoms and walking woods. Dead gods and runes of power. Druids, sages, princes and thieves. Valor, heroism and terrible deeds.\nFinger-Dice (Bonus Goal): A simple method to roll on the Oracle tables using just the humans at the table. Who needs dice?\n$28,000 -- REACHED!\nCradle of Civilization (Oracle): Explore how new inventions disrupt the old ways, uprooting societies and traditions. Tame fire. Invent the wheel. Write the first laws. Erect monuments that defy death itself.\n$35,000 -- REACHED!\nEssence (Seed): A new drug changes society. Its benefits are so great that living without it becomes unacceptable. Play it as the pivot point of humanity's expansion into space, a discovery brought back from the colonies in the age of exploration, or utterly disrupt the modern world we know.\nKaiju Century (Seed): Towering leviathans emerge, crushing everything in their path. No city is safe. Does humanity fight back with giant mecha or cower helplessly and lament their own hubris?\n$40,000 -- REACHED!\nHouse of the Dragon, House of the Unicorn (Seed): Knights and lords clash as two noble houses vie for supremacy. Rex Alicorn! Rex Draconis!\nBrave New World (Seed): Colonists settle a new planet. Can it grow into a flourishing, civilized world or will the colony fail and be forgotten?\n$45,000 -- REACHED!\nApocalypse (Oracle): It's the end of the world! Quakes, plagues, comets or zombie uprisings! Does civilization fade into the dust or does something new rise from the ashes?\n$53,000 -- REACHED!\nOracles Online: Need a seed for your game? Get out your phone, go to the Oracle web page, pick a category and it will automatically generate one for you. This includes all the Oracles from the book plus the ones backers at the Oracle level request.\n$58,000\nLurking Darkness (Oracle): Weave histories of horror, from classic Gothic to Lovecraftian terror. Dig too deep and expose secrets better left unknown!\nAll backer levels get all the stretch goals! New goals will be revealed as each is unlocked.\nI've been floored time and again seeing how kids rock Microscope. Parents have been playing it with their children and teachers have been using it in the classroom for a wide range of ages with great success. As a way of saying thanks, I created a special backer level to make it easier for teachers everywhere to bring Microscope to the classroom. Because teachers are awesome.\nThe books are labelled educational, not for resale. This level also includes a PDF of both books for the teacher, so you can get started learning the game before the books show up.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the third book I've released so I know what it takes to get the job done.\n\nMost of Microscope Explorer is already written. There are still parts I'm working on (and doubtless parts I\u2019ll revise again) because I want it to be a valuable tool for Microscope players everywhere. The new versions of Microscope have already been playtested and are ready for the table. I could decide they needed some more last minute testing and revision (because I'd rather do that than waste people's time with a flawed game) but right now they feel solid.\n\nI\u2019ve been using the same printer for years and I have total confidence in them. There was an issue with the cover lamination in the first printing of Kingdom, but the printer fixed it and I offered free replacements to anyone affected.

If you enjoy world-building, you'll love making a society in Downfall.\nYou begin by choosing a Flaw\u2014something like greed, complacency, or loyalty\u2014 to serve as the theme of your game. This long-ignored Flaw has finally surfaced to show its teeth. Though the Flaw has always been there, it is just now beginning to destroy everything it created.\nThen you create a detailed set of traditions, practices, and beliefs that your society holds dear. These are the pieces you will break throughout play.\n\"Downfall's unique approach to world creation sets players up with a rich web of referents and cultural artifacts at their fingertips. For relatively little effort at the outset, the crumbling society jumps into vivid focus.\" - Jackson Tegu, creator of How We Are Like The Storm\n\"Downfall is, hands-down, the best game I\u2019ve seen at giving you structured, step-by-step tools to build a culture that doesn\u2019t feel like an off-the-peg genre exercise, is fleshed-out enough to be navigable and intriguing, yet doesn\u2019t take the entire game to set up. It produces worlds that are genuinely unexpected, without requiring any vast leaps of creative brilliance.\"Sam Kabo Ashwell of These Heterogenous Tasks\nWe role-play to explore the collapse of the world, witnessing and shaping the destruction of our home through our characters.\nDownfall features phrase-based escalation in the style of games like Archipelago and Polaris, and one of my favorite things about the game is how smooth it is to go from narrating an intimate scene to executing bold actions and sweeping changes.\nPlay continues until the characters' home has met its downfall. Sometimes when the game ends you mourn the destruction of the world, but more often it's bittersweet\u2014you see how broken the world was and feel that it was better for it to have burned. Sure, it was awful for the characters, but it made a great story. \n\"I had no idea the story would get so creative and complex! It was extremely collaborative and we built on each others\u2019 ideas.\" - Kelly Michelle Baker, author of The Waters of Nyra\n\"Downfall's key phrases are awesome. With just a few words, you can unlock the innermost feelings of a character, add a hefty price tag to the Hero's brash action, or find out what comes of any move another character makes. They're tools that allow players of any skill-level to make the most of the game.\" - Marc Hobbs, creator of Eden\nI'm really interested in games that focus on a single cohesive story, and Downfall does a great job of delivering that by letting each person take turns playing the hero.\nThe game features a cast of three main characters, which are created collaboratively, and each character contributes something different to the game. The Hero is the protagonist, trying to save the world. The Fallen is the  antagonist, trying to corrupt the Hero and the world. And finally the Pillar is an average person, trying to stifle change.\nThe characters rotate. After playing two scenes you pass your character sheet to the player on your left. You were just the Hero a moment ago, but now you get to play the Fallen. \nCharacter rotation means you interact with all of the characters from different perspectives as you shift who you are playing throughout the game. It also focuses play on a single story\u2014the story of the Hero's failure.\n\"Downfall games were my most memorable play experiences of 2015. Sharing characters means the story trumps everything. It is *the* game to play if you have just three players.\" - Jamie Fristrom, creator of Energy Hook\nDownfall has been played at Story Games Seattle, Story Games Olympia, GoPlayNW, in countless cafes from Seattle to South Korea (and who even knows where else), and with people of all experience levels, from those who've never played story games to story game veterans. It works, and I know it works because of the numerous hours that have been put into play-testing it with a wide variety of people over two and a half years.\nI've got some crazy skilled editors on hand and a brain-trust of indie game developers to give me good advice, and I myself am a veteran story gamer (I've played a really wide variety of indie-RPG systems\u201477 by my current count! Wow!). I've made Downfall the kind of game that I love to play over and over again. \nWant to see the game in action? Check out this condensed example of play!\nDesigner/artist/architecture intern Audrey Gibson is doing the art and it looks awesome. The art is all about looking back at collapsed societies and seeing the ghosts of their buildings. She studied images of historical ruins and recreated them to be something a little more fantastic. I wanted someone with an eye for architectural design, and Audrey was the perfect choice.\nVideo Music: There's Probably No Time (Chris Zabriskie) / CC BY 4.0\nDownfall is a genre-neutral game, you can play it in any setting that you dream up. But what if you know you want to have a science-fiction or fantasy game right from the beginning?\nGuides allow you to gear your game towards a specific genre. They provide carefully-bounded freedom for your world creation. \nGuides are essentially the playsets of Downfall. You still create the world together, but they give you some genre-specific jumping-off points to get you started. \nGuides:\nAdventure: a land where heroes are born [UNLOCKED]\nInterstellar: a universe of discovery [UNLOCKED]\nThe City: a skyline of glitter and grit [UNLOCKED]\nCreation: a dreamscape full of life and potential [UNLOCKED]\nWeb: a network of infinite connections [UNLOCKED]\nUnspeakable: a cacophony of broken landscapes [UNLOCKED]\nFable: winding paths of bird and beast [UNLOCKED]\nCyber: the world has been upgraded [UNLOCKED]\nThe Present: a normal place where people live normal, modern lives [UNLOCKED]\nSuperhuman: a world defended by heroes [UNLOCKED]\nColor PDF and book!

And you need to store them safely, but conveniently, so you can recall them whenever you need to.\nThe Enigmaze password manager takes the headache out of creating new strong passwords or updating existing ones and allows you to quickly decode your password when you need to use it.\nFeatured in:\nWith the Enigmaze kit there are hundreds of ways to create strong passwords.\nYou need to have passwords that are difficult to decipher.\nHow do you do that?\nIt's simple: create different passwords for every single account, and make them impossible to guess.\nHowever, this creates a new problem. How good is your memory?\nIf you are like most people, you probably have difficulty remembering what you had for lunch yesterday! When you have many different, extremely complex passwords how can you remember even just one of them, let alone all of them?\n Take this one for instance: xXkleG!8+Ke$?mcd\nIt's a great password, but will you be able to remember it?\nAnd, you need dozens more just like that one - all different.\nEnter Enigmaze - a secure password manager logbook that enables you to quickly create passwords that are almost impossible to guess, yet easy to find and use when you need to log in to your online accounts.\nEnigmaze comes in a classic gift box, so it's a great present for your geek friends.\nWhy do we call it Enigmaze?\nEnigma comes from the second World War where there was a gadget called the Enigma Machine. The Enigma Machine was invented by a German, Arthur Scherbius to encode messages sent by wire so that if intercepted, the messages would be unreadable. Basically it was a method of creating a coded message that looked like nonsense to anyone other than the recipient.\nCreating passwords that are difficult to crack is not difficult, but remembering them is.  \n\nEnigmaze to the rescue!\nKeep your password secure in your wallet or share it with a client\n\n\nYou can use a variety of encryption methods, such as a UV invisible ink pen, transparent overlay cards, your own custom method, or much more. The choice is yours!\nThe Enigmaze notebook gives you:  \n- Hardcover stitched binding\n- Pocket size A6 (94 x 143mm / 4\"x5.7\" exterior) \n- 88 sheets of acid free ink-proof 70 g/m2\n- Different grid for every sheet.\n- Alphabetical tabs (3 pages per letter) for organizing and storing you passwords. \n- 10 empty sheets for taking notes at the end of the book\n- Plenty of space for web addresses, usernames (yes, we forget those, too!), and passwords.   \n- A light weight, sturdy construction that is ideal for carrying in your pocket, handbag, or backpack. \n- An elastic closure and an expandable inner pocket.   \n- Invisible ink marker with UV light (may not be as shown)\n- Frosted, grid printed PVC card.\n\n\n With Enigmaze, you will never, ever, forget a password again! \n\nEarly prototype under UV light\nHow to use Enigmaze:\n\nThere are many ways to use your Enigmaze password logbook, and your methods are completely up to you. You can even vary your methods for different websites creating impossible to crack passwords, even if somebody else has your Enigmaze.\nFor example, one method is drawing a line on the grid with a UV pen. \nThe line can be straight, or parts can be drawn at different angles. Alternatively, using the outer letters and numbers for navigation, you can highlight individual characters on the line. Your password can be any length you wish, but anything less than eight characters is not recommended.\n\nUsing an erasable ink pen to change your password often.\nPLAY\n\nThe alphabetical index enables you to find your password quickly, for example you would go to 'G' for Google, or Godaddy. \n\n\nYou can have lots of fun just thinking up new methods while at the same time creating passwords that are almost impossible to crack!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe learned a lot from our previous projects and we are confident we can deliver a high quality product, on time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comments": [{"username": "Maxim Polevoy", "content": "After not using it for several years, it finally proved very useful for keeping track of all the cryptocurrency wallets and seed phrases.", "time": "about 1 month ago"}, {"username": "Erik", "content": "I did not receive it either.", "time": "almost 3 years ago"}, {"username": "Ross1", "content": "Refund will be fine.", "time": "over 4 years ago"}, {"username": "Ross1", "content": "I still have not received it.", "time": "over 4 years ago"}, {"username": "Ross1", "content": "I did not receive mine as well.", "time": "almost 5 years ago"}, {"username": "john", "content": "thanks.", "time": "over 5 years ago"}, {"username": "Paul Watson", "content": "Hi...

I'm not sure I would classify $3 as a heavy discount, I don't want to seem ungrateful but we didn't even have a chance to do a review as we haven't yet got anything to review and yet are still prepared to back another project, that requires a lot of faith in you, which I have as I've backed the new one and I'm sure I'll receive something eventually.

There is so much we think we know about the Party but I wanted to go beyond the oversimplified narrative of the Panthers as prone to violence and consumed with anger, and explore why so many people joined, what they accomplished, and why it fell apart.\nProducer Laurens Grant, former Black Panther Kathleen Cleaver with Director Stanley Nelson\nAfter years of hard work we were thrilled to premiere the film at this year's Sundance Film Festival. The film has gone on to sold-out screenings at festivals in Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis and Los Angeles. The response so far has been amazing, but we have bigger goals for the film.\nKathleen Cleaver at the Sundance Film Festival\nI made this film with the hope that it would reach diverse audiences - folks who might not attend film festivals or watch PBS.\nThat is why I am launching this Kickstarter campaign. My goal is to raise $50,000 to support a theatrical release of the film.\nIn my 20 plus years of independent filmmaking, I've had great success in premiering eight films at the Sundance Film Festival, as well as numerous national PBS broadcasts. However, theatrical releases have always been a challenge, not only for me, but also for the majority of independent documentary filmmakers. Between the high costs of booking and promotion, and the bare bones budgets for indie films, getting a documentary into theaters is next to impossible. I believe this film will be even more powerful on the big screen, where people can share the experience with their peers, youth, elders and other community members who recall that turbulent time. So, in the spirit of the Black Panthers I am taking our cause to the people!\nWHY THE STORY OF THE BLACK PANTHERS NOW?\n\"The issues that the Black Panther Party and other Black Power organizations dealt with in the 1960s continue to be the major issues confronting the black community today...The film is a must-see for all who are looking to better understand where we are at this historical moment and where we might go in the future.\" - Pan African Film Festival\nBlack Lives Matter protest\nWhen people see the film they tell us the same thing, \"This film could not have come at a better time.\"\nFor us this Kickstarter campaign is about more than just getting into theaters, it's about sparking a national conversation on the conditions that created the Black Panther Party, conditions - like police violence, substandard education, joblessness - that continue to plague us today.\nAs we witness the similarities between the injustices of yesterday and the tragedies of today, we feel a sense of urgency to share the story of the Black Panther Party. We are struck by the way today's movement around police brutality and accountability is being led by young people seeking change, just as it was with the Black Panther Party almost 50 years ago. We believe we can reach a greater number of young people from diverse communities by bringing the film to theaters across the country.\nUltimately, we want to bring this vibrant chapter in American history to life so that we can all understand it, learn from it and make better decisions - personally and collectively.\nWHO IS ON BOARD?\nWe are fortunate to have the support of an amazing group of organizations and individuals who believe the film needs a wide audience. \nHOW WE WILL USE THE FUNDS\nOur plan is to open theatrically in at least thirteen cities - New York, Los Angeles, Oakland, San Francisco, Berkeley, Chicago, Boston, Portland, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Atlanta, Seattle and Washington D.C. PBS Distribution is financially supporting the limited theatrical distribution of the film this fall, so monies raised through this Kickstarter campaign will fund additional promotional support for these screenings. \nWith 50k we can pay pay for:\nMusic rights for the theatrical version of the film\nTargeted online and print advertising in the thirteen cities\nSeasoned publicist with experience reaching young people and communities of color\nTravel costs to bring Black Panthers to screenings\nIf we exceed our fundraising goal we can expand our list of target cities and deepen our promotional efforts! \nTHE BLACK PANTHERS will air as a special presentation of INDEPENDENT LENS on PBS in early 2016, but we want to bring the big screen experience to as many communities as possible through a theatrical release.\nREWARDS\nAs thanks for your tax-deductible support we are offering some great rewards; like a private streaming link to view the film, limited edition Black Panther merchandise, tickets to theatrical openings, Google chats with former Panthers like Kathleen Cleaver, signed prints by former Minister of Culture Emory Douglas, DVD box set of my films, and a filmmaking master class in my Harlem studio.\nLimited Edition Black Panther T-Shirt\nLimited Edition Black Panther T-Shirt\nViper Records artist Immortal Technique Combo Pack\nSigned copy of \"One Crazy Summer\" by author, Rita Williams-Garcia\nSigned copy of \"Panther Baby\" by author, Jamal Joseph\nFilm Poster\nThree unique, signed, limited edition, color prints designed by former Minister of Culture Emory Douglas.\nSigned, black and white photos from legendary civil rights photographer Jeffrey Blankfort\nSigned, black and white photo from legendary civil rights photographer Jeffrey Blankfort\nSigned and numbered 16x20 portrait of Marshall \"Eddie\" Conway\nSigned and numbered 1976 photograph of Kathleen Cleaver by Ilke Hartmann\nSigned and numbered 1970 photograph of teen with \"Black is Beautiful\" jacket by Ilke Hartmann\nOriginal, 48x48\" oil and acrylic portrait of LA chapter founder Alprentice \u201cBunchy\u201d Carter.\nWith your tax-deductible support we can bring this powerful story to theaters across the country.\nThank you for your support.

That is, until I saw Jim Lujan's animated shorts.\nJim Lujan and Bill Plympton at San Diego Comic-Con\nI was friends with Mr. Lujan long before I knew his work. I first met him when he helped interview me for an animation Web show, and then handed me his DVDs. Now, I get sent a lot of DVDs of people's work, and if I watched all of them I would never get any films done. However, one rainy afternoon when I had nothing to do, I slipped in his animation since I thought he was an amusing kind of guy.\nWell, I was stunned by the brilliance of his writing, voices, and character design \u2013 they were so rich and fascinating. I watched his animated shorts over and over. I realized his ideas and characters were a perfect fit for my animation. I called him up and suggested we create a feature film together using his story, characters, and voices.\nHe said yes and, amazingly, a few weeks later, he delivered one of the most amazing scripts I'd ever read. These were characters from the underworld sleaze of Los Angeles (a world I knew nothing about) yet his humor and characters were right out of my warped brain.\nSo far it's been a wonderful working relationship. His characters are so much fun to animate \u2013 I'm having the time of my life.\nThe film should be completed in the first half of 2016, and the more I get into it, the more excited I get about the potential of this crazy story called REVENGEANCE.\nBill Plympton\nApril 2015\nProduced, animated, and directed by Bill Plympton\nWritten, designed, voiced, and music by Jim Lujan\nTHE STORY\nREVENGEANCE tells the story of a low-rent bounty hunter (named Rod Rosse, The One Man Posse) who gets entangled in a web of seedy danger when he takes on a job from an ex-biker/ex-wrestler turned U.S. senator named \"Deathface.\" Rod has to find what was stolen from the senator and find the girl who stole it. Soon, Rosse finds there\u2019s more than meets the eye to this dirty job. Between the ruthless biker gangs, the blood thirsty cults, and the crooked cops - Rod Rosse is a marked man. If the bullets don\u2019t kill him - the California sun just might!\nRod Rosse, The One Man Posse\nThe film features the voice talents of Jim Lujan and Dave Foley (THE KIDS IN THE HALL, NEWSRADIO, A BUGS LIFE, MONSTERS UNIVERSITY).

We hope you share our passion for this fun way of communicating! It doesn\u2019t matter which reward you choose - we will put these stickers inside your package no matter what, as long as we reach $250.000 CAD goal. There are only several days left, so hurry up to spread the word to reach it quickly!\nStatically Charged\nMeet the Magnetic family: Magnetic Notes, Magnetic Pads, Magnetic Boards, and Magnetic Sheets. All Magnetic products are based on stable static charge, which lets them stick to any dry surface. Magnetic has no glue, so it's completely movable and replaceable. Enjoy visualizing your ideas, brainstorming in teams, and leaving messages. Now THAT'S a convenient and fun way to communicate!\nAny Surface\nMagnetic can stick to any dry surface, including wood, plastic, metal, leather, glass, textile, paper, and more. No glue means no traces. Magnetic is fully charged. It can even stick to the ceiling! \nIdeal Handwriting\nMagnetic in not actually paper. It's better than paper. We created it with the idea of getting enjoyment out of writing on it. With Magnetic\u2019s unique smooth surface, you will be amazed that your handwriting is more beautiful than ever, regardless of whether you use a pen, a pencil, or a marker.\nReusable Back\nMagnetic can save you lots of money that you would otherwise spend on sticky notes. Not only can you stick Magnetic notes from either side, you can also write on the back with a marker, erase it, and write all over again! It's like always having an erasable surface with you.\nThe Magnetic Family\nMagnetic Notes that come in 3 sizes in 9 different colors, including transparent and black for white markers\nMagnetic Pads that are larger options for painting, classifieds, and many other office and home uses\nMagnetic Boards that you can stick and write on with markers, erase, and write again.\nColor Range\nMagnetic Notes and Magnetic Pads come in 9 colors. We will ask you about your color preferences as soon as Magnetic is successfully funded.\nMagnetic Standards\nWe\u2019ve conducted hundreds of experiments to come up with the best product possible. We set strict quality standards and refuse to compromise on them. We love the environment, so we made all Magnetic products fully recyclable.\nWhat Next?\nNow we have peerless technology and perfected product. We want everyone in the world to be able to enjoy convenience of Magnetic. To do this, we need to set up cost-effective mass production, which will guarantee good prices and the best quality. But we can only do that with your support! We need about $30,000 CAD. We commit to pledge half of that by ourselves. For the other half, we invite you to participate in this awesome challenge. We'll be thrilled to have an army of backers behind us to help us write Magnetic's story.\nLet's Make the World a Better Place\nWe want children in the poorest African schools to enjoy the comfort and convenience of whiteboards that they don\u2019t currently have. So for every $1,000 we raise, we will be able to equip one school with 10 Magnetic reusable boards, 3 maps, erasers, and markers. This campaign will last throughout 2015, and we will post reports on it all over social media with the hashtag #AfricanEducation, as well as through updates to our backers.\n                 ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have been working really hard for several years to ready Magnetic for its broad public appearance. We have gone through all the stages of the production process, and we know exactly what issues are hidden under each step. Our senior engineer has more than 30 years of experience in the paper industry. We already have substantial experience manufacturing Magnetic on our small production line. All we need now is to scale it to mass production. However, as with any product, there are risks and challenges related to delays. Supply chain logistics can potentially impact product delivery. Additionally, delays may result from testing procedures. We will do our best to choose the best shipping option possible, but we cannot guarantee their fulfillment on time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #21", "update_userinfo": "New Products!", "update_content": "Hi backers and friends,  "}, {"status": []}], "comments": [{"username": "Anuchart Matanasarawoot", "content": "I did\u2019t get any items yet, please please please check......", "time": "over 1 year ago"}, {"username": "Melissa Bianco", "content": "I love these!

When we hit the $88K mark we will subtitle our film into 6 different languages -  Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, German and English.  We've received multiple requests for each so there you go!\nFor our second reward we decided we'd give you guys a 2for1. We will supply all of our fans who pledge $12 or more with a custom Billy Martin BTTF print that has never been seen.  Secondly, we will head back to LA to film one more time with some amazing guests.\nBehind The Scenes\nJoin the Back in Time team on our final journey before launching Kickstarter.  See Robert Zemeckis, Alan Silvestri and more. To see more BTS journeys click here - Behind The Scenes with Back in Time\nNew Reward Levels\nAs we try and bring you the most exclusive documentary access we can, we've been hunting for the most exclusive rewards we can find as well.  Check out these exclusive new opportunities.\nWhat Amazing Press! We've Been Featured In:\nWhat is Back in Time?\nPut simply, it's the ultimate documentary related to the Back to the Future trilogy. It's a film that digs deep into what these movies have meant to our culture. It's not a simple \u201cmaking of\u201d documentary, but rather one which explores the incredible, lasting resonance of the trilogy through the eyes of cast members and crew of the films, as well as some of the ultimate fans of the trilogy.\nPlus, the DeLorean Time Machine itself, of course.\nIt's a film that we think was begging to be made, so we did. All signs point to that being a great idea. After all, at this year's Academy Awards there were multiple references made to Back to the Future. 2015 marks the 30th anniversary of Back to the Future, and it's also the year Marty, Doc, and Jennifer visited in Back to the Future II.\nDidn't you do this before? It sounds familiar.\nYes! You may have seen or backed our previous Kickstarter campaign back in the summer of 2013. We were fortunate enough to enjoy widespread support from over 600 Back to the Future fans, and we've used the money raised during that campaign to fund filming the majority of the film.\nAnd on that note, we want to make sure we're very clear: every single pledge from the original campaign is still on track for delivery later this year, as promised. Nothing about this second campaign changes the original rewards, so if you're a backer already: THANK YOU, and you'll be receiving fulfillment this fall.\nWait, if you're already funded, what's this campaign for?\nBack in Time originated as this little idea after doing a customized \u201cflashback\u201d film for a client. Originally we were going to focus on a single, iconic part of the trilogy: the Time Machine. But as sometimes happens with an idea that has found its moment, Back in Time has grown in scope as we've progressed through production.\nThings we originally considered unlikely, or even impossible, have been captured by our crew as we've crisscrossed the country, and the world. If you'd told us that Michael J. Fox or Robert Zemeckis would have been willing to, let alone incredibly enthusiastic about, sitting down to talk about what the trilogy has meant across three decades, we'd have thought you were as looney as most of Hill Valley considered Doc Brown.\nBut we have those interviews in the can, and that's not all. Not by a long stretch. Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Bob Gale, Dean Cundey, Kevin Pike, and so many more cast and crew have lent their time to our efforts to chronicle the impact of the films. Plus some of the most amazing fans any movies have ever been blessed with, including Time Machine experts like Joe Walser; the Hendersons, who are responsible for bringing us hoverboards by 2015; and the Hollers, whose support for the Michael J. Fox foundation brings new perspective to what dedication a fandom can spawn.\nSo as much as we've carefully expended the money we collected during our previous campaign (and money from other, more traditional sources\u2014including our own pockets when we needed to) the sheer scale of the film as it stands today is far beyond our original dreams.\nThe side effect of our amazing good fortune is that we've exhausted the funds from the original campaign, while there are a number of things we can still use funding for in advance of the premiere this fall.\nBut this isn't just an opportunity for us, of course. This Kickstarter campaign offers new backers the chance to pledge for their perks, and allows returning backers to add to their previous commitments. We've also got some limited perks that are new to this campaign, and are offering up one last chance for you to get involved\u2014really involved\u2014with Back in Time before we release it into the wild.\nIn the end, this is a film which is for the fans of the films to salute the incredible, lasting impact they've had.\nA large number of the cast and crew of the trilogy, plus a bunch of people who have found themselves caught up by the films and had their lives changed profoundly as a result. But maybe you'd like to take a gander at these partial lists?\nRobert Zemeckis, Michael J. Fox, Bob Gale, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Dean Cundey, Alan Silvestri, Claudia Wells, James Tolkan, Donald Fullilove, Jeffrey Weissman, Kevin Pike, Michael Scheffe, and Andrew Probert are some of the trilogy's cast and crew we've interviewed.\nMJF Foundation fundraisers Terry and Oliver Holler, restorationist Joe Walser, collectors Bill & Patrick Shea, webmaster Stephen Clark, author and historian Rob Klein, hoverboard entrepreneurs Jill & Greg Henderson, Secret Cinema director Fabien Rigall, author Rich Handley, Superfan and Community creator Dan Harmon, and our own co-executive producer and The Goldbergs creator Adam F. Goldberg, are some of the fans who have taken the time to speak with us about how the Back to the Future trilogy has affected them.\nAnd have we mentioned that we have the DeLorean Time Machine on film? We have a few of them, actually. (Plus Marty's truck. And the clock tower. And so much other stuff.)\nAs you can see in our list of rewards, we've compiled quite an extensive list of unique rewards for those who choose to donate to this film.  While many of the awards are self-explanatory we thought wed show you some of the amazing rewards here.\nBack in Time Movie Poster\nBRAND NEW T-Shirt Design\nRobert Zemeckis Signed Marty Disappearing Pictures\nRobert Zemeckis Signed Delorean Time Machine Replicas\nRobert Zemeckis Signed T-Shirts\nMichael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd Signed CUUSOO Legos\nBTTF Script Signed by Writer Bob Gale\nAlan Silvestri Signed Sheet Music\nJames Tolkan Signed Hill Valley Sign\nExclusive Signed Andrew Heath Back in Time Delorean Print\nWe have 27 amazing rewards.  Check them out...\n Jason Aron \u2014 Director\nAn avid filmmaker for the past decade, Jason has been heavily involved in professional sports filmmaking for much of his career. He has interviewed and worked alongside personalities from all corners of the industry\u2014star athletes, team owners, pundits, analysts, and more. In addition to this heavy focus on documentary filmmaking, Jason has an extensive background in directing commercials for a wide range of companies. Jason\u2019s passion for the medium can be traced way Back in Time, to when he made a line-by-line tape recording of a certain iconic film. He\u2019s the original driving force behind this film project, and his commitment to the integrity of the documentary\u2019s material is second to none.\nLouis Krubich \u2014 Executive Producer\nA production company veteran with a long resume headlined by an extensive stint at MTV Networks, Louis leveraged his extensive knowledge of the industry into success as one of the principals at Hoboken-based Malka Media Group, a 2011 startup. His production work at MMG routinely brings him into contact with diverse clientele. Louis has worked with star clients including Adam Sandler, Michael Cera, Cameron Diaz, and Tom Cruise; as well as with major brands, corporations, charities and educational entities such as Ray-Ban, ESPN, the Embrace Kids Foundation, and New York University. Louis\u2019s Viacom past includes work creating impactful promotional content for major film releases\u2014an experience he intends to rely on to ensure the release of Back in Time is everything it can be.\nLee Leshen \u2014 Producer\nLee got his start in the industry doing finance and marketing work at Miramax Films and The Weinstein Company. Having cut his teeth with these major players, he founded Patchwork Media in the mid-00\u2019s. A facilitator at heart, Lee brings a vast array of experience in developing mutually beneficial arrangements to the table. His company\u2019s focus on finding ways for branded entertainment and media outlets to benefit from forging partnerships (and admittedly massive BttF fanboy status) paved the way for Lee signing on with Patchwork Media to serve as a production company for Back in Time. A problem-solver with an unconventional outlook, Lee\u2019s input has proven invaluable to the project ever since, and his marketing experience is about to be put to seriously good use.\nAdam F. Goldberg \u2014 Co-Executive Producer\nAdam is a producer/writer best known for his television work. He created and ran the hijinks-heavy Breaking In for two seasons on Fox, then followed up with The Goldbergs, the critically-acclaimed comedy not-so-loosely based on his own experiences growing up which once had an amusing, if less-than-clean, working title. With the series set to enter its third season in 2015, Adam is busy working non-stop on multiple new projects, including Back in Time. Adam\u2019s extensive resume includes screenplay credits for Fanboys, The Jetsons, Aliens in the Attic, The Muppet Wizard of Oz, and How to Train Your Dragon, as well as the upcoming films Flat Stanley and The Berenstain Bears. In addition to being the force behind two comedy series success stories, Adam has written for many other TV shows, including Community, Aliens in America, and Voltron Force\nGregory Lassik \u2014 Cinematographer\nGregory is the owner/operator of two production companies: Spark + Boom, and Endless Wave Studios. He brings extensive experience with documentary and commercial filming to the project, along with an incredible heart. Gregory\u2019s attention to always doing the right thing locks right in with his desire to, well, blow things up. His vision is influenced by this purity of purpose and he thrives on creating modern, electric cinema. His dedication to capturing the essence of the cultural phenomenon that BttF has become is expressed through what\u2019s at the center of the Back in Time project: the raw footage we shoot.\nThe Rest of Our Team\nAs the scope of this project has grown, so has our team.  To see a full list of our crew visit our website here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFortunately we've managed to complete the vast majority of filming on the documentary already. Barring some kind of \u201cAct of God\u201d we're going to premiere Back in Time as planned this fall in Los Angeles\u2014during the 30th anniversary celebrations for Back to the Future known as We're Going Back. \n\nThe biggest risk of not making our campaign goal is that we'll be unable to screen Back in Time at as many film festivals as we'd like to, and that will mean less people get to see and hear about what we've put together. Failure to fund might also have a slight impact on how much better the final film could be, but considering what we have now vastly exceeds our wildest dreams for what this project was ever going to turn into, that's nowhere near a disaster. At this point we're adding little pieces to something already amazing, not working to get something presentable.\n\nIf we do end up failing to fund, we'll still be aggressively pursuing other avenues for trying to get together the funding to improve on what we have and to get more exposure. But to be honest, we believe in our film, we believe in the fans of the back to the Future trilogy, and we believe that a movie born of the passion we all share can't help but attract enough attention to succeed.\n\nLong story short: pledging has pretty much near zero downside. Back in Time is set to be a phenomenal documentary which really gets to the heart of the immense cultural significance of the trilogy, and it will be ready for backers to enjoy in October of 2015.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #23", "update_userinfo": "Full Video of the Shea's BTTF Collection Livestream!", "update_content": "That's right, the wait is almost over!

This is our third and most exciting attempt at funding Braiiiins!

Each achievement will unlock something new!  Check back here often for progress and new achievements!\n Here is what we've unlocked so far with this campaign!\nYou are Zombie!\n1-6 player game\nCooperative or Player vs Player\nIncluded Game Play Scenarios with many more on the way!\nControl the Horde!\nHigh Quality Printing!\n104 (Unless we unlock more!) Cards and 50 Tokens!\nSmall size box perfect for travel and Pub Games!\nDynamic Rules that can be learned in minutes!\n You are the start of the Zombie Apocalypse! You don\u2019t know how you became a zombie, but you won\u2019t be going to that middle management job today.\nMay as well go out and turn the town of Risington into the undead! Enjoy those Braiiiins!\nBraiiiins! is a simple to learn card game, but offers a complex and dynamic rule system. It can be played as a single player game or up to six players in both co-op mode or player vs. player.\nYou control a Zombie Character and will raise up minion zombies to fight the Living characters in the Feeding Fields! With multiple scenarios and difficulty options, this game can be played by almost anyone.\nEach Zombie has a type that determines how they will spawn minion zombies. Check out the rule book for more details on each zombie type.\nEach Risen Zombie also has a type that determines how strong they are, and how much damage they can take in a fight.\nAnd all Zombies team up to fight against the Living, which come with some special rules of their own!\n Because we launched the project in the U.S. and on President's day we are putting in a limited edition Character Zombie card!  George Zombington!\n And a crossover character from Black Market Warehouse, The Backer!  Here she is for Braiiiins! as the Zombie Backer!\n Here is the video review from NVS!\nWe sent a copy of Braiiiins! to a tutoring center in New York who backed our first game Black Market Warehouse. We wanted to give a view of our game as played by a group of different ages. Michael, from the center, wrote us this morning on how the game went. Here is what he had to say:\n\"The game is easy to set up, and a blast to play. It just doesn't reverse the role of the player, playing as the Risen, instead of the Living, it puts choices on the table that could make or break your game. If you pick the wrong Living card to fight, you could be giving the easier cards to your opponent, which you want to avoid. It's more than just flip a card, add some numbers, and deal with it. It makes you make choices that affect the outcome, on different levels. Not a braiiin burner, but it makes you think more.\nFrom the students, the overall feeling was \"Can we play again?!\" They loved it. They enjoyed the ability to basically pick the Living that the opponent would have to deal with.\n\"I like playing as the zombie, but I like how we have to pick our obstacle.\"\n\"It's fun to think about which would be easy for you, but to make sure that the other players don't have it easy, either.\"\n\"It's a lot of fun, and I want to reshuffle and play it again, right away.\"\nThe replay-ability of the game, not only of the two different decks, but of the different characters, lends itself to multiple plays without the possibility of repetition. It's random, and the decks either hate you, or draw in your favor, but either way, it's a blast to play\"\nThank you Michael Guigliano, and the kids at the tutoring center, for your feedback and helping with the game!\nAfter a lot of suggestions and Fire Testing the rules have been updated!  We have made a lot of improvements in the 2.0 rule book!  Have a look if you've played the Print and Play version.  Use the new 2.0 rule book instead!  Another change is some of the risen cards will now have special rules!

Once the Fire Squadron community has our games, we will listen to suggestions for new rules or changes to exiting rules. In our own gaming experience, we\u2019ve added multiple house rules to almost all of our games. While house rules are fun, having rules not sanctioned by the gaming company creates issues when playing with different sets of friends. We want to avoid this. Through our web based community, we will provide regular updates, allow house rules to go up for votes, and provide other forms of constant support for our games. We know how important it is to be heard by a game company when you find a rule that doesn't work. We will listen and react quickly to all forms of feedback and suggestions.\nWhen you get your copy, join the community at www.firesquadron.com. Let your voice and suggestions be heard!

Setting the goal at $1 ensured we would print as we took out a loan to cover some of the cost.  This was a huge mistake as we underestimated the actual cost of printing and shipping.  Shipping being largely more expensive than printing.  This is our mistake and we're not trying to make excuses, just helping you to understand.  All the US shipping was completed as it was a lot less expensive and simple.  The EU shipping was more complicated and required more money.  As we've currently blew through our loan and the money raised on this campaign we're trying to find other avenues to collect the $3000 needed to ship the games.  We've looked into bank credit, another loan and help from friends and family.  As our business model fell on its face with this campaign it's been hard to find someone willing to lend us the money.

It's our fault completely. We are having trouble finding a shipping company to fulfill the shipping without causing any extra VAT fees for you backers. The last thing we want to do is surprise anyone with extra fees. Normally we would just suck it up and eat the cost but at this point we can't do that. We don't have the funds. I know that sounds like a lame excuse but we have enough to ship them out and that's it. Andy and I obviously didn't know what we were getting into with this game and it's shipping. We missed our deadline. The cost was too high to produce and double to ship. We have great faith in the games we design. But at this point we're done with Kickstarter. I understand your frustration with us and I'm sure you're glad we're not going to try again. I doubt you'd back us again. I know I wouldn't. What's next for us is a more traditional game publication. We're going to keep making games, but not try and raise money from backers to do so. Next time you see Fire Squadron games you'll be able to buy a game that already exists. No waiting. I'm sorry we messed so much up with this campaign. But don't get me wrong, you will get what you paid for. Most of you have, and while some are waiting, it will arrive as soon as we can get it to you. I get it that you're mad. We would be too. I'm sorry about that.

You have thankfully passed that goal but again it has helped that you have been creative at parceling out the stretch goals. Unfortunately I have been involved with other projects where they \"underestimated\" the true costs of the stretch goals and starting crying poverty. Now in this case, since it involves mostly cards and not plastic (though you are introducing plastic into the game now) perhaps the costs will be manageable.

Details on the game are here and some of the new art is here.\nThe Story\nThe Family Arcana is a work of fiction to be published as a deck of playing cards, with each card containing a piece of the story. The cards may be read in any order: play a round of poker and read your hand aloud, pick your favorite cards and string them together, or shuffle the entire deck and see what happens.\nA project years in the making, The Family Arcana is the work of author Jedediah Berry. It is the portrait of a sprawling family bound to their decaying farmhouse by a web of passions and strange obsessions. Sleepwalking Mother, heartbroken Father, bitter old Grandfather, loopy Grandmother, a jittery flock of suspicious aunts, uncles, and cousins: all their stories are told by the children of the house, who are impossibly numerous, darkly vindictive, and ever watchful.\nEach shuffle of the deck reveals a new pattern of secrets, confessions, anxieties, indictments, and dreams. The family grows, shrinks, and changes, trapped forever in its haunted house of cards.\n*The actual number of variations is 8.06581751709439e+67 (a number 68 digits in length).\nCard Back / Three of Hearts\nSo Why Playing Cards, Mr. Berry?\nI'm so excited to finally be sharing this project with you.\nIt started about three years ago, when I woke one night with a voice in my head. Except is was more like a dozen voices, all trying to tell their stories at once. Like me, these folks were in an old farmhouse at the edge of town. They were trying to tell me about something terrible that had happened, or about something terrible that was going to happen. I got up, went to my desk, and opened a pack of index cards. I started writing. I wrote until the sun came up.\nAfter that night, I always kept a few index cards handy. Whenever new parts of the story came to mind, I\u2019d take out the cards and jot them down. For each new piece of the puzzle, I allowed myself only one side of a single index card, but contained in each card I'd often find the kernel of an idea for the next.\nLater, I began to experiment with the story at public readings. I shuffled the cards and asked someone from the audience to cut the deck. I let the story take a new shape every time. The readings felt surprising and also collaborative. Afterwards, people would tell me which parts were their favorites, which characters they wanted to hear more about.\nI kept writing. I realized that I would soon have a full deck of cards, and that the cards could be mapped to the standard suits, applying a kind of order to this chaos of voices. A lot of people asked me where they could find a deck of the cards, and for a long time, I had no answer. This campaign could change that.\nI\u2019ve grown to love this tragic family of oddballs, dreamers, and lost souls. But after years in their company, I\u2019m finally ready to let them go. I hope others will take them in.\n\u2014Jedediah Berry\nFive of Spades / Joker A\nWho Are We?\nNinepin Press is a new independent publisher of innovative fiction and poetry. We are interested in bold storytelling, unusual voices, and experimental forms. We love bestiaries, old maps, board games and card games, science fiction and fantasy, mysteries, gardens of forking paths, comic books, and cabinets of curiosities. We want to publish great fiction and poetry, and we want to create beautiful objects.\nBy supporting our fundraiser, you will help us publish our first title in its ideal format: a deck of playing cards featuring color card backs and jokers. The illustrations are by artist Eben Kling.\nThe co-editors of Ninepin Press are Jedediah Berry and Emily Houk. In addition to writing The Family Arcana, Jedediah is the author of a novel, The Manual of Detection, which won some awards and was adapted for broadcast by BBC Radio. For a sample of his work, check out this story, free to read online at Tor.com, or track down a copy of The Manual of Detection at your local bookstore or library. Jedediah also has nearly twenty years of experience in independent publishing. He serves as an associate editor of Conjunctions, and he has worked as an editor for Small Beer Press and as Managing Editor of the poetry journal jubilat.\nEmily Houk is a writer and librarian, and something of a secret agent in certain corners of the book world. She has held many odd jobs\u2014fish counting, butter-cutting, cooking at a sorority\u2014but she always gravitates back toward libraries, books, and reading. She's worked at five libraries in Western Massachusetts and currently works at one. The first card game she learned to play was Thirty-One, gambling with nickels and dimes up near the Canadian border.\nWe are grateful to everyone who helped make the video above. The music is by The Suitcase Junket, and the art is by Eben Kling. Readers include Bik Aulakh, Christina Barber, Cait Bliss, Emily Houk, Ish Klein, Matt Lorenz, and Greg Purcell.\nWhere Will the Money Go?\nInto a hole in the ground. Then we'll dig it up and use it to cover the costs of printing and shipping the cards and other rewards, and to pay our illustrator. If things go very well, we'll make the cards even better. Possibilities include more art, hand-lettering, custom tuck boxes, etc. More on all that in good time.\nAce of Diamonds", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are familiar with the challenges that can arise in publishing.

By planning and reflecting on your habits, you focus on the processes rather than the goal itself. Yes, goals are important to identify and give direction, but your daily habits are what will get you there. There are plenty of habit tracking apps on the market today, but The Habit Journal is the first notebook style journal to help track habits using pen and paper. As with any traditional paper exercise, it creates more commitment and accountability from anyone using it on a daily basis.\nThere are 6 main areas where goals and habits can be set and tracked:\nGoal Setting Map\nIt\u2019s really simple \u2013 its based around a plan/do/reflect style of journaling.\nYou choose a goal.\nYou write down the daily habits that you think will help you achieve that goal.\nYou plug those habits into your daily tracker pages.\nThen at the end of each day, take 5 minutes to reflect on how you did.\nReflect at the end of each week and repeat until the month end.\nUse it for recording your daily habits. Use it to plan your day ahead. Use it to reflect on how well you did throughout the day and assess the progress you are making towards your goals. Use it to get in the habit of feeling gratitude. Use it to hold yourself accountable for actions taken or not taken. Take it everywhere, mark off your habits as you go along and remind yourself that this is your life, you can choose any goal and practice any habit. \nExamples of using The Habit Journal to achieve your goals\n 1. It helps you focus on the small actions you can take today. Too many off us focus on the bigger picture and become overwhelmed with goals. When you concentrate on the small wins you can make every day, you\u2019ll notice instant progress towards achieving your goal.\n2. It forces you to become your own accountability partner. The journal won\u2019t shout at you. It wont tell you you're fat. It wont phone your mum and tell her you\u2019re not taking your vitamins. It will however make you feel accountable for your own progress and this in itself, will empower you to take action.\n3. There is science behind it. It is scientifically proven that journaling provides you with clarity, reduces stress and provides a better understanding of yourself and your habits.\n4. It only takes 5 minutes effort every night. That\u2019s it. You don\u2019t have to do anything other than plan at the start of the week and reflect at the end of the day.\n5. You can\u2019t turn it off. Set the journal beside your bedside as a reminder. Unlike your habit tracking app, it can\u2019t be turned off or ignored. The basic act of putting pen to paper brings its own reward.\n6. It\u2019s simple. There\u2019s not a whole lot to it. Our tagline pretty much describes how simple it really is: Track your habits, achieve your goals, change your life.\nI genuinely believe The Habit Journal can help anyone improve their life. Whether you're a housewife who wants to lose weight, a student who wants to get better results, a entrepreneur who wants to be more successful or a life coach who wants to help your clients, the journal will be of benefit. \nOne important caveat though: It\u2019s not magic. You still have to put the hard work in. However, once you start noticing improvements in any area you focus on, you'll realise that anything is possible and your goals will start getting bigger.  \nIn The Habit Journal, you\u2019ll find a simple and beautiful layout, designed to get you thinking about what you truly want in every area of your life.  \nTake a look at a sample of The Habit Journal:\nThe journal includes the following:\nYearly Goal plan. \nMonthly plan and reflection.  \nWeekly plan and reflection.\nDaily tracker.\nPre populated \"Foundation\" habits to get you in the right frame of body and mind to do more habits.\nA weekly to-do/ priority section.\nA weeky notes and ideas section.\nA daily gratitude section.\nAnd the following physical features:\nHigh quality acid free paper that will not bleed through.\nDate free pages so you can start anytime of the year.\nLay flat design.\nA5 size.\nHigh quality soft feel cover with logo.\nPage marker ribbon.\nMade in the UK.\nAny habits you can think of. I've started a list over at www.thehabitjournal.com but here are some of the more popular habits to track:\nFor as far back as I can remember I've had trouble with public speaking. So when I was due to get married in January 2013, the thought of giving a speech to over 100 people was truly terrifying. I knew I needed to somehow overcome my fear. So I started by writing  my goal in the middle of an a4 page. I then thought about all the things I could practice until the wedding to make me more confident and help me achieve the goal. Talk to a stranger every day. Practice speaking out loud in the car on my way to work. Visualising the reception room full of family and friends. Going over my speech again and again. Eventually after a few weeks of tracking these new habits, I started to feel more at ease with the speech. On the day itself everything went really well and my speech was a success.\nAnd this got me thinking about my habits and what I really could achieve if I started tracking the right ones. And the habit journal was born.\nIf you can't afford The Habit Journal then you need it more than anyone!!\nThis is why I am giving it away FREE to anyone that can't participate in the campaign itself but would like to change their life through tracking their habits. \nJust share this project by clicking one or both the buttons below: \nThen send me an email getthehabitjournal@gmail.com and you will get the printable PDF version once the campaign finishes.\nThe Habit Journal changed my life. It's as simple as that. So many people have asked me about where to start and what to do. I would start with watching your daily habits. Shine the light of consciousness on what you do day to day and you'll start improving your life. If you are sceptical, try the printable version for a month.\nThe design work is finished and I have one of the top book manufacturers in the UK ready to print the journal for us. As soon as the campaign is finished I will place the order for the journals. Once manufactured, they will be shipped to me and I will then carry out the final step of fulfilment by delivering them to backers. \nI aim to ship all journals by mid April. With any product that needs to be manufactured there is always the possibility of unforeseen delays. However, I will keep all backers updated with progress throughout the entire process. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any Kickstarter involving a physical item, the biggest risk for us is manufacturing and shipping. However, we have our manufacturer ready to print so I expect to ship the journals in a timely fashion. \n\nI've seen enough Kickstarter campaigns to know most people just want the truth. That is what you will get with this project. TRANSPARENCY. I will keep everyone informed of progress throughout this process but if you have any questions please just ask - chris@thehabitjournal.com. \n\nThe journal has changed my life and I want this for you too, so if problems do come up or you aren\u2019t happy with your journal, I promise to do everything I can to make it right.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "Udemy course is back up", "update_content": "Hi Everyone,\nWe've shipped all of the journals!\nIf you haven't received yours yet, don't panic it should be on the way. \nHere are some things to bear in mind for those of you still waiting:"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #32", "update_userinfo": "The Habit Journal Course on Udemy.com", "update_content": "Hi Everyone,\nJust a quick update on where we're at with getting your journals to you.

It works much like a car jumper cable. You simply connect a 9 volt battery to the Plan V device and then hook it up to your phone.

Battery jackets are clunky and even they can run out of juice when you're on the go. \nThese issues drove us to start working on a true emergency charger, one which has you covered when everything else fails.\nWe started to think about your car, you don't carry around a spare battery in the trunk, you carry a jumper cable. The same principal can apply to your phone. We all know batteries are everywhere (convenience stores, supermarkets, gas stations) so, all you need is a jumper cable.

Stranded in Bogota, Colombia they were without a lifeline, their mobile phones dead, battery back-ups flat and hopes of finding their hostel were growing slim. After hours of wandering through dark and dangerous lane ways and a few close calls they finally found their accommodation. It was that night Evan and Luke decided to create an ultra portable, failsafe charging device, one that will never let you down no matter where you are in the world.\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nIt's (really, really) small\nWeighing in at only 7 grams - Plan V is designed small enough to sit on your keyring.

I checked it again last week and it performs exactly the same now. So pretty pleased that the design intent is being fulfilled as an emergency charger. One issue I had with the iPhone was during \"normal\" mains charging, with an intermittent connection (iPhone binging and beeping its disapproval). This was quickly resolved once I realised the lightening connector loves collecting \"pocket fluff\"! A quick dig with a paper lip removed the gunk from within the connector (the phone was turned off) and the problem was resolved. The curated muck had been preventing the lightening connector from pushing in deep enough to make a truly solid connection.

I received my Made For iPhone Plan V (black) last week and have just started a quick test. I waited until my iPhone 5 had decided that it couldn't continue to work and powered itself off. A 9v alkaline battery (Sainsburys own brand was the cheapest I could find) clicked into the well fitting sockets and plugged the lightening connecter into the phone. Result instant charging, at two mins the phone had rebooted and was working again. At 20 mins it was at 18%. At 40 mins it is at 30%, 36% at 50mins. These charge rates are whilst the phone is switched on, with bluetooth, wi-fi and a 3G signal hovering between 1 and 2 bars. At an hour it has reached 41%. I will leave the battery connected to see if it charges any further, however I think my quick test shows me that an emergency charge of 41% is quite adequate. This could be extended by using the new update, reduced power mode offered in IOS 9. The build quality is great, securely snaps together and will sit on a key ring no problem. I chose a black finish for a stealth look, however I think I would pick a red, emergency colour if I had my time again. Maybe when the Plan V is made available I will get an attracting red one and wait for people to ask what it is! Well done Flintu on successfully completing this project. Some people often forget on Kickstarter that they are seeing the concept, development, trials and manufacture stages of getting a product to market, with all the usual delays associated with these stages, delays that are normally hidden from them.

(In other words increase the usability by making them adapt chargers from the opposite camp.) If it accepts 12v then consider an adaptor cable to the humble car socket. (Though if the 5 volt supply works then 12 volt to car USB chargers are in abundance.) I like the project and understand my add on suggestions fly in the face of the concept of reducing adaptors ... but still think the suggestions enhance the items usefulness.", "time": "over 6 years ago"}, {"username": "Roy Romasanta", "content": "@Flintu Just switched out my $2 pledge for a $34 Micro USB/LIghtning combo.

Backers $101 and above get a 10\" of the bsides and demos- only available from this kickstarter! PLUS... we will release all the Kickstarter covers on a vinyl record set that backers will get 25% off the future price.\n\nWHY ARE WE DOING A KICKSTARTER?  By overwhelming demand, you guys convinced us this is a much more interesting and effective way to pre-sell an album. We brought back a few things from the last Kickstarter & also created a bunch of new stuff we thought you'd like. There were moments of beauty that happened with the release of our last record- generous backers- friends making extraordinary gestures, and overwhelmingly positive reactions from everyone involved. Let's see what happens this time!\nNEWWWWWWW RECORDDDDDD\n\nWHAT ARE THE MAIN THINGS WE ARE SELLING?  This Kickstarter will focus on the production and release of our 7th full length album \"Big Dark Love\" as well as \"Framed: The Poster Art of Murder By Death\" - an art book that chronicles the history of our tours through the posters we have collected in almost 15 years of MBD shows. The artists are being paid for the use of their art and this will be a limited printing for Kickstarter that will not be available in stores. Adam has saved one of every poster he could get his hands on, and \"Framed: The Poster Art of MBD\" is a collection of our favorites. The book represents 15 years of everything from photocopied handbills for house shows to beautiful glow-in-the-dark prints used to promote theater gigs. It also has essays by the band and several screenprinters/artists. \nART! BOOK! ART BOOK!\nBy being a backer you also support reprinting our older albums on vinyl. We release all our vinyl, and maintaining the space and organizing deliveries is expensive. The last Kickstarter helped us reprint those albums, and we're running out of stock again! We want to continue to create beautiful vinyl records, so we thank you for facilitating their production and hope you continue to enjoy them. \nArt book proofs!\nKickstarter only T-shirt designed by comic artists Ryan Browne & Thomas Quinn\nI BACKED THE 2012 KICKSTARTER. ANYTHING SPECIAL FOR ME?  We want to acknowledge the people who supported our last Kickstarter. ANY 2012 MBD KS BACKERS WHO SUPPORT THIS PRE-SALE WILL GET 3 BONUS TRACKS VIA DIGITAL DL OF B-SIDES/ ACOUSTIC DEMOS OF SONGS FROM THE NEW RECORD. THANK YOU.\nTELL ME MORE ABOUT THE ALBUM...  With Kevin Ratterman engineering and John Congleton mixing, we made the biggest sounding record of our career and we are extremely proud of it. It's called Big Dark Love because it is a collection of non-traditional love songs. Some are dark- too dark. There's one about the love a parent feels for a child, one about love of humanity- it's all over the place. This is a really strong record for us and we hope you enjoy it as much as we do. It will come out February 3rd, 2015 on Bloodshot Records. \nTELL ME MORE ABOUT THE ART BOOK...  It is a beautiful full color hardcover 12 1/4\" x 12 1/4\" book (same size as a vinyl record) with over 100 MBD posters from the last 15 years. It has essays by the band and screen printers and artists. It is gorgeous and celebrates the art of the show flyer. Personally assembled by Adam Turla with graphic design by our friend Birch Miller. \nWe have made every effort to track down each artist and it has been a task. Some of these posters are very old and have no signature. But we have found almost all of them and have their permission and addresses so we can compensate them for the use of their posters and get them a copy of the book! Every single response has been positive. \nUs. And some of you!\nFAQ\nWHEN DO ORDERS SHIP?  The band will be spending most of the winter packaging and shipping your orders. Orders go out January 21st! You will get it a few days before it comes out in the store, same goes for digital downloads.\nI'M ORDERING AS A GIFT FOR XMAS- WILL I GET THE ALBUM IN TIME?  No, the record doesn't come out 'til Feb. 3rd. But we are sending holiday cards to each supporter so you can give one to the recipient to whet their appetite for the upcoming gift. Something to put under the tree. As many of you know, we usually do a holiday promotion, so this is kind of like a big version of that! \nDOES THE NEW RECORD COME WITH DIGITAL DOWNLOADS?  YES!\nCAN I ADD THINGS TO MY ORDER?  Sure. Just tag on the price of the other item you want when you checkout, and specify your extra item in the backer survey that you'll get once the KS is funded. For example- if you want the Standard Edition of Big Dark Love on vinyl ($20) AND the Special Edition of Big Dark Love on vinyl ($30) just choose the more expensive reward ($30) and tack on the lower amount ($20) at checkout. YOU CAN'T ADD MORE EXPENSIVE ITEMS TO A CHEAPER PLEDGE AMOUNT. PICK THE HIGHER AMOUNT AND USE THE PRICE LIST BELOW TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH TO ADD ON FOR EACH ITEM. \n\nADD ON PRICE LIST PER ITEM: \n$5 MBD/SAMANTHA CRAIN SPLIT 7\"\n$10 BIG DARK LOVE DIGITAL DL\n$15 BIG DARK LOVE CD\n$20 STANDARD EDITION BIG DARK LOVE VINYL\n$20 MBD/ KICKSTARTER T SHIRT\n$30 SPECIAL EDITION BIG DARK LOVE VINYL\n$65 FRAMED: THE POSTER ART OF MBD\n$200 add on a test pressing! Be sure the direct message us so we know which one you want!\n\nADD THE ABOVE AMOUNT EXTRA PER ITEM WHEN YOU PLEDGE.

You email us at mbdband@gmail.com (hopefully with a few days notice) before one of our events you want to attend and we buy you tickets...however many times you wanna go! If we are opening a show we will do our damndest to make sure we still get you in. We can't guarantee festival entrance though. Any club dates and you're in! Plus you get a cool golden ticket.\nYOU'RE PERFORMING IN A SECRET UNDERGROUND CAVERN!?!?!  Yep. So cool. You'll get a screened event poster and a ticket to a private 150 cap cavern concert in Louisville, Kentucky. There will be an awesome \"brown beverage\" bar in the cave too. Pick up your poster at the show. Will call only. Location will be revealed/emailed to you via kickstarter 1 week before the show, but plan your travels and stay in Louisville, Kentucky. What does the cavern look like?\nCAVE CONCERT!\nHOW DO I GET TO HEAR THE KICKSTARTER COVERS AND WHEN WILL I GET IT AND HOW?  If we beat our first stretch point ($187k) you're all gonna get any recordings of the covers people pay for us to do. We will record it at our local studio. Its free to all youse. It will come out late summer and you will get an email with a link to download.\n\nI HAVE SO, SO MANY QUESTIONS, AM I JUST A REALLY INQUISITIVE PERSON?   Maybe? Just message us through Kickstarter or email us at mbdband@gmail.com and we will try to help.\nREMIND ME WHAT COMES WITH THE FOREVER CLUB?  It starts with a collection of all our albums on vinyl. Then, any time we put something out (vinyl, cds, tour posters, pint glasses, belt buckles, etc etc etc) we send you one. No fuss. We would send shirts but we make so many your closets would overflow. Plus you get a cool patch. I AM A MEMBER OF THE KICKSTARTER FOREVER CLUB FROM 2012, WHAT DO I  GET? You automatically will be mailed LIMITED EDITION KICKSTARTER POSTER SIGNED BY MBD + A WHISKEY CREW T-TSHIRT + THE NEW SE VINYL OF \"BIG DARK LOVE\" + A COPY OF OUR ART BOOK \"FRAMED: THE POSTER ART OF MURDER BY DEATH\"\nWhiskey Crew Patch! Party gang!\n WHAT DOES THE 7\" SPLIT WITH SAMANTHA CRAIN LOOK LIKE?\nSEVVVEEEEENNNN INCCCCHHHHHH\nWILL YOU REALLY RECORD A COVER OF ANY SONG I WANT? EVEN STUFF YOU HATE?  Yes. And we hate a lot of stuff. But that could be interesting and cool. Sometimes the songs you don't expect to work turn out even better. OK ONE ADDENDUM- IT SHOULD BE A SONG THAT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY RELEASED, PLEASE DON\"T ASK US TO RECORD YOUR SONG, AS THAT KIND OF GOES AGAINST THE IDEA WE ARE TRYING TO GET ACROSS HERE.\nTELL ME MORE ABOUT THESE HOUSE SHOWS YOU WILL PLAY...\nOk. This is gonna rule. Some basic answers.\nWHAT AM I BUYING WITH ALL THIS BIG MONIES? Adam and Sarah will come and do a show just the two of them. We play for an hour or so, a set list you choose in advance (you pick 10 songs, and we will pick the rest). We will hang out and party, but obviously, depending on the day, we eventually gotta take off at some point to get to the next show etc etc etc. It's probably regular show length. Like 3 hours. WE WOULD PREFER TO NOT DO WEDDINGS. We did that with the last Kickstarter and it was lovely, but scheduling was difficult and the chance of missing the events stressed us out.\nYES YOU CAN POOL YOUR MONEY TOGETHER WITH A BUNCH OF FRIENDS/ FAMILY. But please don't charge for the show. Ok, maybe you can pass around the hat or take donations or whatever.\nWHY SO EXPENSIVE? First of all, lets not forget kickstarter fees, transportation, accommodations, travel costs, crew, etc etc etc. We know a lot of you have asked us to play your events, and ask how much. We also know this is a lot of money, but this is what it will take to make a general price that includes anywhere in North America. If you are from somewhere other than North America, feel free to contact us, as we are totally open to playing your fine city in a far off land. YOU DON'T AUTOMATICALLY HAVE TO PAY MORE IF YOU ARE FROM FAR AWAY. IN FACT, WE LOVE TRAVELLING TO DISTANT LANDS. It just might take a moment to get us all there. Maybe you wanna do a destination show. That could be awesome. Email us at mbdband@gmail.com to discuss any serious inquiries. \nI WANT TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THE CEDAR POINT TRIP...  We will arrange a time that works for both you and us. It will happen this year depending on what we can work out together. We book you and a friend flights/transportation to arrive in Cleveland/Sandusky, Ohio. The band picks you up in our tour van \"The Pork Chop Express 5\". We check you into your hotel in Cleveland. Then we sally forth to Cedar Point. Don't bother bringing cash- that's what your donation covers. We take you around the best roller coaster park in the world http://www.cedarpoint.com/ like kids in a candy shop. Play your heart out at silly games, ski ball, ring toss, video games, whatever! We dish out the cash and tokens. Ride 20 roller coasters. Eat junk food 'till you get sick, then ride 20 more roller coasters and get sick again. Gonna rule. Contact mbdband@gmail.com if you have any concerns/serious inquiries. Here's some photos from last time!\n\nNO FUN ALLOWED.\nNO SILLY COSTUMES EITHER.\nI WAS AN ARTIST WHOSE IMAGE YOU REPRODUCED FOR THE ART BOOK. WHEN WILL I GET MY $$$ AND BOOK?   They'll ship when everything else does on January 21st, 2015. If you are one of the very few artists who we could not track down, or one of the \"unknown artists\" please contact us immediately at mbdband@gmail.com so we can properly compensate you! \n\nIF YOU WANNA SEE US LIVE, CHECK OUT OUR TOUR BELOW!\nWEST COAST LEG: w/ Rocky Votolato opening\nFri/Jan-30 Seattle, WA The Crocodile\nSat/Jan-31 Portland, OR Star Theater\nSun/Feb-01 OFF\nMon/Feb-02 OFF\nTue/Feb-03 Salt Lake City, UT Bar Deluxe\nWed/Feb-04 OFF\nThu/Feb-05 San Francisco, CA The Independent\nFri/Feb-06 Santa Cruz, CA The Catalyst Atrium\nSat/Feb-07 Los Angeles, CA The Roxy\nSun/Feb-08 Santa Ana, CA The Constellation Room\nMon/Feb-09 Phoenix, AZ Crescent Ballroom\nTue/Feb-10 Albuquerque, NM Launchpad\nWed/Feb-11 OFF\nThu/Feb-12 Dallas, TX Club Dada\nFri/Feb-13 Austin, TX Red 7\nSat/Feb-14 Houston, TX Fitzgerald's Downstairs\nSun/Feb-15 Memphis, TN Hi-Tone Caf\u00e9\n\nEAST COAST LEG w/ O'Death opening\n\nTue/Feb-24 Pittsburgh, PA Mr. Smalls\nWed/Feb-25 Cleveland, OH Grog Shop\nThu /Feb-26 OFF\nFri/Feb-27 Boston, MA Paradise Rock Club\nSat/Feb-28 New York, NY Bowery Ballroom\nSun/Mar-01 Brooklyn, NY Music Hall of Williamsburg\nMon/Mar-02 OFF\nTue/Mar-03 OFF\nWed/Mar-04 Hamden, CT The Ballroom at The Outer Space\nThu/Mar-05 Charlottesville, VA The Southern\nFri/Mar-06 Philadelphia, PA Union Transfer\nSat/Mar-07 Washington, DC Black Cat\nSun/Mar-08 Raleigh, NC Kings Barcade\nMon/Mar-09 OFF\nTue/Mar-10 Tampa, FL The Orpheum\nWed/Mar-11 Orlando, FL The Social\nThu/Mar-12 Atlanta, GA Terminal West\nFri/Mar-13 Nashville, TN Mercy Lounge\nSat/Mar-14 Bloomington, IN The Bluebird @ Pit Stop Music Festival\nMay shows Saintseneca are opening:\nThu/ May- 28 Milwaukee, WI Turner Hall\nFri/ May- 29 St Paul, MN Turf Club\nSat/ May 30- TBA\nSun/ May- 31 Chicago, IL Subterranean\n\nFri, Sat, Sun June 5,6,7 - Secret Cavern shows in Kentucky\nmore info at http://www.murderbydeath.com\nPLAY", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur last kickstarter was quite successful and we had a very efficient delivery system.

A hobo from In Living Color's dream (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrzC02_cjFU). For some reason that silly skit popped into my head. We are deep into packing your orders for kickstarter. We're boxing, labeling, packing and sending em off to a storage space until we ship January 21st. It is a HUGE undertaking, but we do it with joy thanks to your support. Can't wait for you to hear the record. We've started to get feedback from press and whatnot and folks seem to like it a lot. Cool. \n\nThere's still about 150 of you that have not filled out the backer survey. When you log into kickstarter, it will prompt you to fill it out in the top right corner if you haven't already. We can't mail your order if we don't have your address. Once we hit the road for tour our buddy J Busch will be helping us with mailings for those of you that are late on getting us the address. I should note it is too late for address/order changes, as printing labels have already been made and we have already packed over 1000 orders. \n\nExpect your orders to show up a few days before the official release date of February 3rd via Bloodshot Records!

They ship January 21st, and other than being home for the holidays for 4 days, and being out west for the Stanley Hotel shows/transit we are working every minute to fill your orders. You'll likely get your records a couple days before the official release date of Feb 3rd. Exciting. \n\nWe just booked some time to record some of the cover songs in late April, and we hope to have the rest done by August. Everything is coming along nicely! \n\nHope to see you on the road! We have a lot of tour dates all up onsale at\n\nAlso adding a couple shows in the midwest (just a couple) and then some in Europe.

It was during our testing and manufacturing runs that we realized that our \"ultra lean\" production was in need of improvement.\nSo, naturally, we flipped the design process on it's head, and Token Hu, our co-founder, set out on a mission to create a manufacturing led designed shoe.\nAfter almost 12 months of factory re-tooling, prototyping, and street testing, THE NINJA was born and we are releasing it in 4 colorways.\nWith resources dedicated to our original LIGHT WING series, THE NINJA is still in the late stage of development.\n1. Create a full set of of injection molds for the new EVA foam rubber outsoles\n2. Standardize our 3D molds to unify our model sizing\n3. Pre-purchase all materials in bulk and reserve factory time and tooling for THE NINJA production\nThe involvement of the entire team throughout the design process, from factory floor workers, to quality control managers, to factory managers, to our entire design team made the creation of THE NINJA an incredible experience.\nTHE NINJA project was the first time we implemented (from end-to-end) THE UT.LAB scientific approach to footwear design where we:\n1. Identify a Problem, 2. Develop a Challenge, then use 3. Rapid Prototyping and small batch testing, followed by a 4. Demand-driven go-to-market strategy.\n1. An incredibly simplified manufacturing process \n2. Re-imagined and re-usable packaging \n3. A new standard in comfort, lightweight, and minimalist design in casual shoes\nThroughout this prototyping period we studied everything from the number of stitches, to patterns cut, molds set, adhesives used, and materials required.\nWe started with TYVEK\u00ae, the material we had become so accustom to using, but as we played with it we decided we wanted to try our hand with new materials.\nWe moved on to the most commonly used material in footwear, PU. Look no further than your closet, and you will find shoe after shoe made of PU. We found it to be too bulky and heavy, while simultaneously absorbing too much foot heat and moisture.\nIt was MICROFIBER that gave us the perfect balance as a material we could do so much with, without having to rely on other components to create form and provide comfort, reduce total component structure, and speed up manufacturing time without sacrificing quality.\nAt 1/20th the diameter of a strand of silk, microfiber is durable while being super comfortable and soft to touch.\nTechnically speaking 'microfiber' is a general term used for many of the synthetic materials born in the late 1950's. The discovery and commercial experimentation with Microfiber began with TORAY and DUPONT. In fact TYVEK\u00ae, the fundamental material to our LIGHT WING series, is classified as a microfiber.\nThe Microfiber we have chosen for THE NINJA is a woven flash-spun terylene with non-split fibers.\nWhere most of the Microfibers you are accustomed to are designed to be soft and absorb water, this Microfiber is a bit different.\nWe are using a Microfiber that repels water (non-split fiber), is durable and strong (flash-spun), soft to the touch (a woven microfiber), and sustainable (terylene).\nNo. This time around we have a much better understanding of our factory's capabilities. We feel comfortable not having to limit our production on this run of THE NINJA. \nTHE NINJA has been designed for intelligent factory production, and we're excited to have our Kickstarter backers be a part of this process. In fact we will allow backers (after the project closes) to choose from one of 4 colorways.\nJust like our first go-around on Kickstarter, all backers we will be getting a uniquely numbered shoe. \nThe first 9 backers will have their assigned backer number #0001-#0009. ALL OTHERS will be randomly assigned (we learned the first time the difficulty in assigning hundreds of numbers).\nNINJA APPRENTICES - $55  \nAt this backer level you are getting one pair of THE NINJAS, and you're helping us make this project a reality. Just like all the early backers, your NINJA will have a Limited Kickstarter Serial Number. [One pair of NINJAs in any color and size]\n(Suggested Retail: $58). (Free US Shipping)*(Final International Shipping Fees to be calculated in July 2014)\nNINJA DUO PACK - $90 \nBuy two pairs and save $26. Get two pairs of NINJAS in any color and size combination. Just like all the early backers, your NINJA will have a Limited Kickstarter Serial Number.\n(Suggested Retail: $116). (Free US Shipping)*(Final International Shipping Fees to be calculated in July 2014)\nMASTER NINJA - $88 - [ALL GONE] You're awesome! Be the first person to back us here and get our #1 shoe (MSRP: Priceless).You'll always be able to say that you were our first customer of THE UT.LAB NINJA. Your shoe will have a customized 0001-K embroidery on the heel. No other NINJA will have this customization. [One pair of NINJAs in any color and size]\n(Free US and International Shipping)\n8 FLYING NINJAS - $58 - [ALL GONE] Maybe you weren't quick enough to get #1, but don't miss out on numbers 2-9 (MSRP: Slightly less than Priceless). Be the only people in the world to have a single digit UT.LAB NINJA. [One pair of NINJAs in any color and size]\n(Free US Shipping)*(Final International Shipping Fees to be calculated in July 2014)\nNINJA MAVENS - $38 - [ALL GONE] Don't drag your feet for too long (Backers 10-100), you'll be saving $20 off our future retail price, and you'll get the Limited Kickstarter Serial Number. [One pair of NINJAs in any color and size]\n(Suggested Retail: $58). (Free US Shipping)*(Final International Shipping Fees to be calculated in July 2014)\nNINJA CLAN- $48 - [ALL GONE] Despite being a bit slow, we have an awesome deal for you, you're still going to get a $10 discount off of future retail price, and you'll get the Limited Kickstarter Serial Number. (Backers 101-499). [One pair of NINJAs in any color and size]\n(Suggested Retail: $58). (Free US Shipping)*(Final International Shipping Fees to be calculated in July 2014)\nEvery backer will receive their NINJAS packaged in an all-new re-usable UT.LAB TYVEK shoe-tote.\nWe designed this bag for international courier delivery in mind, as we attempt to reduce our impact on domestic and global shipping, while simultaneously creating a tote-bag that you will love to carry around with you to the gym, to the office, or on your next trip.\nThe Velvet TYVEK\u00ae Tote makes the perfect travel companion when you're on the go. You can chuck an extra pair of THE NINJAS in your briefcase and not worry about scuffing up you laptop.\nOr you can go tote-less, and just chuck them in with THE NINJA Wrap. \nOr for slightly longer trips THE NINJA makes the perfect shoe to throw in your carry-on.\n And the ultimate shoe to make airport security checkpoints a breeze.\nAT CHECKOUT, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE YOUR SIZE. \nALL BACKERS WILL RECEIVE A MESSAGE FROM US TO REQUEST YOUR SHOE SIZE AT THE BEGINNING OF JULY AFTER THE PROJECT CLOSES.\nSEE SUPPORTED SIZES BELOW:\nTHE NINJA IS A UNISEX DESIGN.\nUS Men's Size 5-15 || US Women's Size 6-16 || EURO 37-48\n*PLEASE NOTE:\nOnly FULL SIZES will be available.\nNO half-sizes will be made for THE NINJA.\nGetting the right fit in shoes is always a bit tricky. But, we have spent the last year working with customers to better understand general sizing. It will never be perfect, but we feel confident that you should get the right fit. The width of the shoe is between a D/E, so those with slightly wider feet, shouldn\u2019t worry about our sizing. On top of that, Microfiber is quite flexible and offers a forgiving and soft flexibility. Because we are not producing half sizes, then we suggest that you order the next half size up (i.e. if you're a 9.5, you'll want to order a 10).\nWe are constantly exploring new materials and the application of those materials in footwear. Obviously there are many materials and design elements that go into our shoes, but let's focus on three: Microfiber, EVA Foam Rubber, and the Poliyou Insole.\nThe combination of these three material choices has allowed us to perfect our weight to strength to minimalism ratio. The shoes are just impossibly light and impossibly minimal, weighing in at less than 130g per shoe (Men's size US 11), and using less than 8 major components.\nThe Microfiber in THE NINJA is the perfect solution for our minimal design concept. It's strength has allowed us to use it as the sole material to wrap around the manufacturing last, while simultaneously keeping the minimalist silhouette form and providing a high level of everyday endurance.\nWe are constantly being asked if THE NINJA outer will soak up water like a \"shami\", the answer is No. THE NINJA Microfiber is a non-split terylene. It's a synthetic designed to repel water while maintaing an incredibly soft texture.\nOur first Kickstarter allowed us to launch our EVA foam rubber outsole. And for this time around we have taken the durability, flexibility, and street tests from the first Kickstarter to perfect our newest EVA \"cupped outsole. \nThe cupped structure has allowed us to reduce the weight and maintain the identical strength and comfort of the LIGHT WING TRAINER outsole.\nSometimes there is no need to re-invent the wheel. We are sticking with our POLIYOU insole. We have made some minor modifications for the fit and feel inside THE NINJA.\nCombined with the EVA foam rubber outsole, and utlra-minimal design of the shoe, you get a low profile shoe that gives you similar cushion to what you feel in a more advanced cross-trainer athletic shoe.\nPOLIYOU has three core features: it's got some crazy ventilation ability, it absorbs moisture quite nicely, and helps to stave off bacteria growth.\n1. We create footwear that is impossibly light. \n2. We advance science through every aspect of our design, material choice, and business model. \n3. We are empowering tomorrow's leaders by cooperating with leading education organizations to to make science cool.\nWe think science is cool, and it is the thread that ties every element of our company, our culture, and our brand together. We create awesome shoes so we can change the world.\nWe believe changing the world starts with empowering tomorrow\u2019s leaders with an awesome education and access to rock star educators. You can find out how we are working with Teach for America this school year by clicking here.\nScience is our passion, and it is the fundamental element that drives the hundreds of laboratory experiments that take place on every aspect of footwear design we produce before it hits the market.\nWe are an interesting mix of industrial designers, graphic artists, ceramic artists, logistics specialists, and serial entrepreneurs. You can visit our site and learn more about us here, but in a nutshell the core team is six people who have come together by a random connection over the past two years, who each as individuals, really wanted to change the world around them.\nUnbelievable Testing Laboratory is now our vehicle to do awesome things.\nToken Hu, founder and head designer is a native Chinese with years of experience at frog design and Microsoft. Shaun Nath, originally from Southern California, is a brand expert and logistics specialist who was introduced to the project by Joseph Constanty, a native of Philly, and the ever persistent entrepreneur in China. Wyatt Bai and Kong Kong are our graphic whiz-kids behind any media we produce. And of course Jacinta Huang a ceramicist and dancer by training has become our go-to \"fixer\". We also have to give a shout out to two amazing interns Jono Harley and Kelly Talento who played a big part in making this campaign happen.\nFor the past two and one-half years we have been working closely with our factories to better understand the entire manufacturing process. THE NINJA is a product born from the manufacturing floor, and a product we feel very comfortable with at this stage working with our factory. We have simplified the component make-up of the shoe so to minimize the manufacturing impact.\nThe shoes you see in the video are real prototypes that we have been lab and street testing for the past ten months. Having worked closely with our factories, their workers, and the owners throughout this entire design process, we feel comfortable in fulfilling an order of any size up to 10,000 units and fulfill at the beginning of September.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRISKS and CHALLENGES\n\nSo each of these final tests takes time, materials and human resources. We will be using the funds raised on Kickstarter to expedite this process, so that your shoes will be in your hands by August.\n\nOnce the project closes, we will be able to put together our material orders, and prep the factory immediately thereafter. That means we should be shipping from China direct to anywhere in the world by September 1, and your shoes should be in your hands ten days later.

It is a simple to learn card game that can be played by 2-4 players in about 30 minutes. You must use goods found on the black market to fill contracts you will acquire throughout the game. At the same time, you'll have opportunities to hit your opponents warehouses using hired hands. This won\u2019t only slow them but it can stop them in their tracks!\nBlack Market Warehouse is the first game in the series of Black Market themed games. Each Black Market game that will come out in the future is designed to be added onto Black Market Warehouse. What that means is that this game will grow over time.\nPrototype: This is NOT final Quality!!!\nHere is a link to the PDF of the rules:\nhttp://firesquadron.com/blackmarket/Rules.pdf\nHere are the full rules for Black Market Warehouse. Click the images for a larger view. Keep in mind, all rules subject to editing changes!\nBlack Market Warehouse received a user review of an early print and play version of the game. To see his thoughts and a quick run down of the rules watch the video below! Keep in mind, the print and play version has been modified with bigger cards, and it's going out to each backer pledge #2 and above! Exciting!\nEach game released by Fire Squadron is \"Fire Tested\u201d. \u201cFire Testing\u201d involves a two step process:\n1. Each game has gone through hours of play testing to ensure that rules make sense, are cohesive, and is an enjoyable gaming experience.\n2. Once the Fire Squadron community has our games, we will listen to suggestions for new rules or changes to exiting rules. In our own gaming experience, we\u2019ve added multiple house rules to almost all of our games. While house rules are fun, having rules not sanctioned by the gaming company creates issues when playing with different sets of friends. We want to avoid this. Through our web based community, we will provide regular updates, allow house rules to go up for votes, and provide other forms of constant support for our games. We know how important it is to be heard by a game company when you find a rule that doesn't work. We will listen and react quickly to all forms of feedback and suggestions.\nWhen you get your copy, join the community at www.firesquadron.com. Let your voice and suggestions be heard! We look forward to it.\n If you order through Kickstarter you will receive 5 brand new cards that are not included in any other version of Black Market Warehouse.  This means, if you decide to order after the Kickstarter Campaign is over, your copy of the game will not include these cards.  \nBlack Market Warehouse will include each of the following unlocks as we reach each goal!\nFor an additional cost, you can receive the Black Market Warehouse Item Catalog featuring descriptions for all 70 items found in the game!\n We wanted to give you some Black Market Warehouse badges to pretty up your profiles if you'd like!  Thank you all for sharing our game with everyone and helping us get to our goal. \nThank you!\nFire Squadron would like to first thank you for your support! With out it, we wouldn\u2019t be able to make this happen. Additionally, we would like to thank all of our game testers who put in many hours and gave us constructive feedback. \nFinally, we\u2019d like to thank Leon and his staff at Wingo games. His support and ideas truly helped in the preparation for production.\n\n For our EU backers, the game will ship from the UK avoiding the VAT and customs charges!\nThanks again everyone!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main challenge that we could encounter is our shipment being held up in customs.

Here are the final stretch goals!\nPaperback is a word game where players create words. It's 2-4 players and takes about 45 minutes.

She\u2019ll have to work her way up writing everything from Mystery to Romance to get to the best seller list. Also, Paige loves the worlds she writes about and secretly wishes she could live them.\nPaperback blends the skill of word games like Scrabble\u2122 with the interesting choices of deck-building games like Dominion\u2122. There are many ways to win \u2013 making short powerful words, long clever words or possibly a double word score.  Each card has a distinct ability that can dramatically help your score if used wisely.  \nIn each hand there is usually one perfect word that will use all your letters \u2013 you just need to find it!   Flexibility comes from two elements: a \u2018common\u2019 vowel and wild letter cards.  The 'common' vowel can be used by all players and changes throughout the game.  You will have several wild cards in your deck - wilds also double as victory points, which determine the winner.\nCheck out the Rules here\nKickstarter is a necessity to get the capital required to print a boardgame.

It rewards a strong vocabulary, sure...but it also allows someone who's not a Scrabble aficionado just as much a chance at winning. Plus, I love deck-building. So that's a bonus.\"\nJeff Cannata (@jeffcannata) of the Totally Rad Show:\n\"I love word games and I love deck builders - now I can get both in one game! Paperback is a blast to play, and much easier to get into for my less geeky friends than many of the other fantasy-themed deck building games.\"\nEric R. Burgess of Boardgame Babylon:\n\"Paperback is a terrific game for just about anyone. Serious gamers can geek out on the clever use of deckbuilding mechanisms in a classic word game. Casual players can enjoy the easy gameplay and creativity they express in their word choices each turn. Families can delight in the well-disguised educational value and very obvious fun Paperback provides. Our family and friends have had a great time playing Paperback and I know you will, too.\"\nAn extensive review from Father Geek:\n\"I like it. I like it a lot. It\u2019s the only word game I have played in a VERY LONG TIME that had me thinking on multiple levels. I really enjoyed the deck-building aspect as it challenged me to buy cards that I knew I could use with existing Letter cards for mega points. That is actually a lot harder than it seems because every Letter card is only as good as the other Letter cards that are in your hand. I also had to be creative when it came to maximizing the card abilities. If I did it right, my simple three-letter word scored massive points, which felt great. I think this is the closest thing to a \u201cgamer\u2019s word game\u201d I have ever seen. The game play is engaging, the turns are quick, and everything I love about deck-building is seamlessly entwined with everything word gamers enjoy most, which is spelling words.\"\nMy friend, Tom Mason, enjoys the game so much that he decided Paperback needed to be on mobile devices.

Quality art is not cheap! That said, Kickstarter exists as a strange sort of dual entity. On one hand, it's a means to support creative people and help make their dreams a reality, in return for which you receive some sort of small gift. At the same time, Kickstarter has become widely used as a pseudo-preorder system, sometimes subtly and sometimes quite explicitly. Which it \"should\" be is a debate for other places, of course, but the reality is that a lot of people do treat support for a Kickstarter project as just a purchasing decision, as opposed to considering the overall value of each project in terms of components, production costs, and so on. Personally, I love supporting new and/or independent designers and creators, but I'm also a cheapskate that works hard to keep myself on a tight gaming budget. I can't support everything, no matter how worthy the project. This game won me over because it looks like a perfect combination of some games my family loves to play, and I'm happy that I can both support its development and look forward to getting a copy or copies in the mail come December!", "time": "almost 8 years ago"}, {"username": "Hunter Bennett-Daggett", "content": "Oh, one more totally unsolicited suggestion - is there any way to make the print-and-play files available to backers before the end of the project? Even if the files are very much a work in progress, with missing cards, missing art, etc., I think this could be a boost to the project because it will allow people to be trying the game and providing first-person reviews during the project. One of the main reasons that I backed Euphoria was the positive reviews of people on BGG who had tried the PnP and talked about why they liked it, what worked and didn't work, and who should consider backing it. You've gone to the trouble of soliciting full-fledged reviews from Father Geek and others (which is great and gave me the confidence to back!) but \"gamer on the street\" reviews can be very valuable too. It looks like this project is treating the PnP as just an additional deliverable, which is fine, but I have seen them used very effectively as a marketing tool. In addition, it gives people like Wilco the option to upgrade to a physical copy if they try the PnP and like it.

Good luck!", "time": "almost 8 years ago"}, {"username": "Hunter Bennett-Daggett", "content": "I agree with Daniel - please find a way to let people order multiple copies, either through an an add-on or a new pledge level. I too would likely get at least one more copy for a Christmas gift given such an option. Also, being able to get multiple copies, presumably at some discount given the combined shipping, would help offset the relatively high cost of the game. I understand Tim's point on the high costs associated with a small print run, but for someone breezing through Kickstarter to check out new projects, the apparent value of this game versus, say, Haggis may not be immediately apparent. However, if you can order six copies at $20 each (??) and divide them up with your gaming group, that might be worth it to more people.

Go through our next round of design specs and bulk material purchasing.\n2. Finalize 3D modeling for the production molds.\n3. Reserve factory floor time and tooling to produce our limited edition LIGHT WING: THE PENCIL.\nTHE PENCIL will be our first non-prototype shoe in the market\nWe are super excited about this. We have spent a long time perfecting the ins and outs of this shoe, and now we want you to have a very special version of it.\nThese are some of the first prototypes that we handcrafted.\nSo what is Unbelievable Testing Laboratory all about?\n1. We create footwear that is impossibly light.\n2. We advance science through every aspect of our design, material choice, and business model.\n3. We are empowering tomorrow's leaders by making science cool again, and cooperating with leading education organizations.\nSo what is TYVEK\u00ae?\nIt looks and feels like paper, but is actually a brand of flashspun high-density polyethylene fibers. \nTYVEK\u00ae is a synthetic material that was \"discovered\" by DUPONT\u2122 in the 1950's and commercialized in the 60's. Take a look at most of American homes today, and you will notice that they use Tyvek\u00ae as an insulation material.\nIt's an awesome ultra light-weight material that is water-proof, but highly breathable. Perfect for homes, and even more perfect for your feet!\nYes, Tyvek is water-proof. Have a look!\nYes, Tyvek is super durable and strong. Take a peak!\nYes, Tyvek is just like paper and we can print on it. See it to believe it!\n\nWhy are we limiting our production to 2013 pairs? \n\nWe think it is better to be safe than sorry. We want to be absolutely certain that we keep our promise to all of you supporters.\nBy limiting our production, we might reduce our reach, but at the end of the day we are 100% certain that we can turn around the project orders and assure you that you won\u2019t be waiting months for your shoes to arrive. \nWe have studied our factories over the past year, and we know that from the day we close the project until the day we are ready to ship should not exceed thirty-five days. And we have even figured out how to ship direct to your house from our factory floor which will speed up our project delivery time!\nWhat will supporters receive?\nAll supporters will be getting a one-of-a-kind pair of shoes.  We thought it would be cool to stamp each pair with a unique Kickstarter ID out of a total of 2013 pairs. Depending on how early you get in on the project will determine exactly what number your shoe is stamped with. \nThe first 110 supporters will be guaranteed a number 1 thru 110. After that, the IDs will be selected at random once we go into production.\nBACKER #1 -  $88 - You are amazing! Be the first person to back us here and get the number 1 of 2013 pairs of the LIGHT WING special edition Kickstarter PENCIL (MSRP: Priceless). That's right, you will forever be able to say that you were customer number one of Unbelievable Testing Laboratory USA. As a special thank you, we will throw in two limited edition Tyvek\u00ae wallets too!  \n8 ROCK STARS - $68 - Second Place is also cool - Maybe you weren't quick enough to get #1, but don't miss out on numbers 2-9 (MSRP: Slightly less than Priceless). Be the only people in the world to have a single digit limited edition LIGHT WING PENCIL. We will also throw in one Tyvek\u00ae wallet too.\nLIGHT WING MAVENS - $50 - Don't drag your feet for too long, you'll be saving $18 off our future retail price (Suggested Retail: $68). When you back us here you will be guaranteed a number 10 through 109 limited edition LIGHT WING PENCIL. After this, all other numbers are not guaranteed. We will also throw in one Tyvek\u00ae wallet.\nLIGHT WING 2nd MOVERS - $65 - Despite being a bit slow, we have an awesome deal for you, you are still able to grab a pair our limited edition shoes! Get yourself one pair of limited edition LIGHT WING PENCILs. (Suggested Retail: $68).\nSPECIAL SOMEONE PACK - $120 - Buy two pairs and save $10. Get two pairs of limited edition LIGHT WING PENCILs. You can get the same size or different sizes, just let us know in the the comments.\nWhat sizes do we support? \nAT CHECKOUT, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE YOUR SIZE. IN ABOUT THREE WEEKS YOU WILL RECEIVE A MESSAGE FROM US TO REQUEST YOUR SHOE SIZE. SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE.\nSEE SUPPORTED SIZES BELOW:\nThe shoe is designed for unisex wear. We will collect all of your sizes after the project has reached its funding target.\nUS Men's Size 6-15 || US Women's Size 2-12.(If a woman has a shoe size larger than a US Women's 12, you can use the Men's sizing, but we do suggest choosing one size smaller). We do US half sizes.\nEURO Men's: 39-48 || EURO Women's: 32-39 (If a woman has a shoe size larger than 39, you can use the Men's sizing, but we do suggest choosing one size smaller). We do NOT have Euro half sizes.\n(Please be very specific with your sizes, i.e. USA Size Men's/Women's OR your European Size Men's/Women's)\nHow to get the right size?\nGetting the right fit in shoes is always a bit tricky. But, we have spent a long time perfecting our fit. When telling us your size, you can use what size you wear in Nike or Converse as a good reference. The width of the shoe is D/E, so those with slightly wider feet, shouldn\u2019t worry about our sizing. Because our shoes are designed for casual use, we can be a bit forgiving in the width. (Please be specific that your size is a US Men's/Women's size or a European Men's Women's Size)\nThe $11 \"Wallet-Only\" Backer\nOne impossibly light TYVEK\u00ae special edition wallet. For those of you who didn't get in quick enough to be one our first 110 backers, then you can also pick up a wallet here for less than half the price of our future retail price. The wallet combines Tyvek\u00ae and leather - blue leather on blue Tyvek\u00ae.\nWhat are the basic elements of the shoe?\nWe are constantly exploring new materials and the application of those materials in footwear. \nObviously there are many materials, inks and design elements that go into our shoes, but let's focus on three: Tyvek\u00ae, URT Foam Rubber, and Poliyou Insole.\nIt has been the relentless testing and prototyping with all of these materials that has allowed us perfect our weight to strength ratio. The shoes are just impossibly light, weighing in at less than 150g per shoe (Men's size US 11), and we are hoping to get it even lighter for the final Kickstarter version that we ship to you. We like to say if you could design the feeling of air into a shoe, then this would be it.\nIf you watched the videos above you already know all the main features of DUPONT\u2122's Tyvek. It's strength to weight ratio is amazing, making it the perfect candidate for footwear.\nThe one question we always get is, can you wash the shoes? Can you really wash the Tyvek\u00ae \"paper\"? And the answer is YES.\nBesides working on the fit and design of the shoes, our number one priority has been the inks and coatings we use to preserve the color when printed onto Tyvek\u00ae. \nCombining that with the cooperation we have with our print house, we have designed  printing applications that allows us to preserve the color integrity of our shoes after real world wear and tear of sun, rain, and the tumbling of your washer and dryer. \nThe Kickstarter Limited Edition shoe will be the first time we produce shoes with our newly tested and perfected URT sole. Using brand new mold design and manufacturing methods, we have been able to make our soles even more light weight than our most recent prototypes, while at the same time increasing durability by a factor of two.\nWe introduced the POLIYOU (3rd party trademarked) insole to our prototypes earlier this year. We have been perfecting the form and fit to use this unique material to reduce our overall material impact. Combined with the URT Rubber sole, and utlra-minimal design of the shoe, you get a low profile shoe that gives you similar cushion to what you feel in a more advanced cross-trainer athletic shoe. \nPOLIYOU has three core features: it's got some crazy ventilation ability, it absorbs moisture quite nicely, and it's got a thing for hunting down that nasty fungus and bacteria that tends to stick around in your shoe--so it helps your feet stink less too!\nWhat is our DNA?\nWe think science is cool, and it is the thread that ties every element of our company, our culture, and our brand together. We create awesome shoes so we can change the world. \nWe believe changing the world starts with empowering tomorrow\u2019s leaders with an awesome education and access to rock star educators. You can find out how we are working with Teach for America this school year by clicking here.\nScience is our passion, and it is the fundamental element that drives the hundreds and even thousands of laboratory experiments that take place on every aspect of footwear design we produce before it hits the market.\nSo who makes up the Unbelievable Testing Laboratory team? \nWe are an interesting mix of industrial designers, graphic artists, ceramic artists, logistics specialists, and serial entrepreneurs. You can visit our site and learn more about us here, but in a nutshell the core team is five people who have come together by a random connection over the past year, who each as individuals, really wanted to change the world around them. And Unbelievable Testing Laboratory is now our vehicle to do awesome things. \nToken Hu, founder and head designer is a native Chinese with years of experience at frog design and Microsoft. Maggie Ma, ever the artist supports all PR and Marketing activities. Kong Kong, is the graphic whiz-kid behind any media we produce. Shaun Nath, originally from Southern California, is a brand expert and logistics specialist who was introduced to the project by Joseph Constanty, a native of Philly, and the ever persistent entrepreneur in China. \nWe think science is cool, and we want you to think so too!\nSo where are we at?\nThis is not our first time working with production lines in China. The shoes you see in the video are real prototypes that we have been lab and street testing for awhile now.\n\nHaving worked closely with our factories, their workers, and the owners for the past 15+ months we are more than certain we can handle the order of our maximum limit of 2013 pairs for this Kickstarter.\n\n\nWe have already done hundreds of prototypes with the factory. Now we are going through the last phases of prototypes for international production. We are standardizing our design for international sizing, especially widths. \nWe are finalizing new rubber materials for the outer sole, reducing our material impact and making our shoes even lighter than what they currently are today! \nWe are also trying to perfect a handful of other key elements of the shoe (things you will probably never notice...but we will!).\nFAQ:\nWhen I check out I cannot provide my size, Why?\n\nWhat sizes do we support?\n\nAre there any other colors or patterns available on Kickstarter?\nIf you have any questions regarding shipping, please email Gabriella@theutlab.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSo each of these final tests takes time, materials and human resources. \n\nWe will be using the funds raised on Kickstarter to expedite this process, so that your shoes will be in your hands by August.\n\nOnce the project closes, we will be able to put together our material orders, and prep the factory immediately thereafter. That means we should be shipping from China direct to anywhere in the world by August 15th, and your shoes should be in your hands ten days later.\n\nWith your support, we can get these impossibly light shoes on your feet.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "Re-release THE PENCIL - 2 Colors for Cyber Monday", "update_content": "Everyone,\nIt has been an awesome ride to get to where we are today.

Co. provides premium American-Made clothing and accessories to our customers at affordable prices, while fostering an environment of collaboration and transparency second to none in the garment industry.\nDue to our direct-from-manufacturer business model, everything we offer is approximately 1/2 the price of what you would pay if we sold through traditional retail outlets.\nWHAT AND WHERE\nOperating out of our own 45 year old factory on the West Side of Chicago, we design and produce some of the highest quality clothing on the market today. We also collaborate frequently with many of the most exciting and creative minds in the industry. We are committed not just to producing our products in America, but to creating jobs and influencing the fashion world in a positive way. We are aiming to be a hub for American manufacturing, quality craftsmanship, and innovative collaboration.\nWHY\nIn order to get where we need to be, we need a little help from you. But don\u2019t worry, there\u2019s something in it for you other than just feeling good about yourself. If we reach our goal, we'll be able to not only fund the production of our Spring/Summer collection, but re-invest into our factory.  Despite our current capacity, we need to make some upgrades. There\u2019s some machinery we don\u2019t have, and some that\u2019s getting a bit old. The more efficient and nimble we become, the more innovative our collaborations will get, and the more jobs we can create.\nAND MORE?\nIf we surpass our $20,000 goal, we will use that money to create new pieces, buy new fabrics, upgrade our factory, and continue working to expand domestic manufacturing. The great thing is, all you have to do to support us is invest in a quality American-made garment.\nTHE GOODS\nHere are some of the products we\u2019ve designed for Spring/Summer. We're premiering these here, at an exclusive Kickstarter-only price point.\nCampaign Buttons - Designed by Jon Contino\n5-Panel Hats (See below for renderings with labels sewn on)\nPocket Squares and Ties\nHorizontal Striped Button Down\nBlue Color Fleck Button Down\nWhite Oxford Button Down\nTHE DESIGNER STARTER PACKAGES\nThe Development Packages include a suite of services that cover every step that a designer must take to get Production Ready. We will bypass the markups of middlemen and agencies to create the shortest and most cost effective path from design to Production Ready.\nSingle Piece Package Includes:\nFirst Pattern \nPattern Grading \u2013 Additional 3 Sizes after the First Pattern\nFabric and Trim Sourcing \u2013 3 One Hour Consultations\nPurchasing Sample Yardage for First Samples \u20132 Colorways - 10 Yd Max - $11/yard max\nPurchasing Trims for Sampling \nFirst Samples Delivered\n- Average agency price for shirt or pants : $1,900 -\nMini Collection Includes:\nAll of the above, but for 3 pieces (1 shirt, 1 pant, 1 jacket)\nJacket Prices:\nFirst Pattern \nPattern Grading\nFirst Samples Delivered\n- Average agency price for jacket : $2,400 -  \nWhen it comes to the actual production of your pieces, you will be hard-pressed to find a level of quality higher than what we can deliver. Our Chicago Factory has been manufacturing Military Uniforms for decades, and that level of quality and attention to detail goes into everything we make. The Military Certification Process is one of the highest quality standards of its kind in the industry. It\u2019s a tedious process, but one that allows us to focus our attention on the highest level of quality and the finer design details. \n We're confident that you\u2019ll quickly recognize the value in our all-inclusive development services when we deliver your production ready samples. By utilizing the expertise of our apparel product development teams, and the vastness of our sourcing network, you now have access to turn your ideas into a business.\nTHE MACHINERY WE NEED\nDouble Needle Industrial Machine with Lap Seam Attachments - Heavy gauge machinery so we can work with higher-weight fabrics.\nDouble Needle Chain Stitch Machine - Heavier-duty stitching for shirting and denim.\nGerber Plotter - Increase our production efficiency by laser-plotting our markers.\nGrommet and Rivet Machine - More efficiently apply grommets and rivets to bags, jeans, jackets, etc to increase output capabilities.\nTie Details\nPocket Square Details\nSizing Guide - Sleeves are measured Shoulder to Cuff\nFit Example: Model is 6'1\", 180 wearing a Large. *Note* This is an original sample shirt.

Open source Android apps are next.\n\nThe RFduino has a Nordic 32 bit ARM Cortex-M0 processor, so it has more power then the UNO, however it still runs the same, simple Arduino code the UNO runs, so there is no need to learn any new programming language or environment.  Your standard Arduino sketches run on the RFduino.\n\nThe RFduino GPIO lines all support, Digital IO, Analog ADC, SPI, I2C, UART and PWM.  There are 7 GPIO and fully software selectable and can be remapped as you wish.\n\nThe RFduino is similar to the Arduino UNO or DUE, except the RFduino is a fraction of the cost and size, in addition has wireless smartphone connectivity built-in!\nUp to now, adding wireless to an Arduino required an additional wireless shield which adds cost and size.  The RFduino has wireless built-in, so there is no need for an additional wireless shield.\nThe ultra small, finger-tip size board shown in video cover picture above has been put into an easy to use DIP form factor with 0.100\" (2.54mm) pins, so it easily plugs directly into your solderless breadboards.\n\n$5K goal met within the 1st day!\n\n$10k stretch goal met within 2 days!  (Added Backer chosen shield.)\n$20k strech goal met within 4 days!  (Added 2nd Backer chosen shield.)\nTechnical Story Video on the RFduino\n\nSome things the RFduino can do\nThe RFduino gives wireless senses to your iPhone and enables it to touch the physical world!\n\nSome more things the RFduino can do\nThe RFduino is a stand-alone board, just like the Arduino UNO. In addition, the RFduino has a powerful ARM Cortex processor and Bluetooth Low-Energy 4.0 built-in, which take your projects to the next level!\nPowerful enough to run your projects.\nSmall enough to fit inside your projects.\nLow cost enough to be used for all your projects.\nIt's perfect for the hobbyist creating do-it-yourself projects, to professional engineers producing proof-of-concept prototypes.\nIt can be used with or without Bluetooth 4.0.\nBeginners can use the pre-written Arduino sketches and advanced users can write their own from scratch.\nWe have several open-source RFduino and iPhone apps which are free to use, extend and share.\n\nStackable Shield Accessory Boards\nThe RFduino has been constructed with high quality, leading edge, state-of-the-art professional grade components.\nWe have also developed a few miniature accessory boards to help you with your projects.  They plug directly into 0.100\" (2.54mm) standard spacing, solderless breadboards or run fully stand-alone.  They are stackable and plug directly into each other to provide many combinations.\n\nGet It All - Pledge Level Information:\nGet It All Kit $139 Pledge Level Includes:\n2 RFduino\n1 USB Programming shield board\n1 RGB LED shield board\n1 Servo Output shield\n1 PCB USB Programming shield board\n1 Prototyping shield board\n1 Dual AAA Battery shield board\n1 Single AAA Battery shield board\n1 CR2032 Battery shield board \nGet It All (Multi Project) Kit $219 Pledge Level Includes:\n5 RFduino\n2 USB Programming shield board\n1 RGB LED shield board\n1 Servo Output shield\n1 PCB USB Programming shield board\n1 Prototyping shield board\n1 Dual AAA Battery shield board\n1 Single AAA Battery shield board\n1 CR2032 Battery shield board\n\nGet It All (Master Developer) Kit $399 Pledge Level Includes:\n10 RFduino\n2 USB Programming shield board\n2 RGB LED shield board\n2 Servo Output shield\n2 PCB USB Programming shield board\n2 Prototyping shield board\n2 Dual AAA Battery shield board\n2 Single AAA Battery shield board\n2 CR2032 Battery shield board\n----------------------------\n- White solderless breadboards, iPhones, batteries, computers, wires, cables and all other items of any type which were used in pictures, videos or demos are not included in any rewards.\n- microSD Shield and the Dual Relay shield are backer suggested shields designed during the course of this project and are not included in any pledge levels.

I really want to see this deck come into the magic community and stay there I feel that this is definitely something that a lot of magicians would like to have.  I own and operate a magic shop in southern California and I constantly get asked for these cards that just don't exist. Since this is a gaffed deck you will notice that the rewards won't be much other than the decks themselves, but that's the beauty of it. You don't need anything else these cards are so special that there is no way you will ever be able to get this deck unless it gets funded. So now its up to you; I really appreciate all your guys support in this project. I know you all can make miracles once these decks are in your hands.\nAbout the Deck\nStandard Bicycle Box\n52 - Mirror double Face Cards\n2 - Mirror Jokers\n2 - Double Blank\nMore about the Deck\nThe cards will be on standard Bicycle cards stock and standard Bicycle finish.

This piece has a 1\u201d by 1\u201d square base and an LCD screen on the front and back, and allows you to upload photos to the piece through a USB connection to your computer. You can then use the buttons on the top of the piece to select a photo loaded to the piece, and use the piece in place of any RPG, d20 game or board game playing piece.\nWith the capacity to hold over 30 pictures, you can carry all of your RPG characters on one piece simply by uploading photos of your favorites to the Doppelganger. You can add multiple pictures of your characters performing various actions, such as fighting, raging, singing, casting spells, or using different weapons, and change the photos on the displays as your characters perform different actions. You can even play with characters and monsters that you do not have in miniature form, since you can simply add the pictures of these characters to the piece!\nWith the Doppelganger, you will no longer need to use tokens, or generic figures that do not accurately represent characters and monsters, since the Doppelganger can hold the photos of any character and replace any miniature. If you are the Game Master of a role playing game, you can upload all of the monsters needed for your session before or during gameplay and you will no longer have to carry or transport multiple figures.\nThe piece can also act as the ultimate life counter for card games where players are allowed to see your life total, since you can add a picture that not only shows the character but includes the character\u2019s statistics. The Doppelganger can even replace the pieces in traditional board games, since the base size is the same size as the squares on most game boards. This piece can also replace any missing or lost game token, no matter what game you are playing \u2013 simply add a photo to the Doppelganger to represent the piece!\nThe Doppelganger also adds a whole new level of creativity to your gameplay. You can load photos of your own artwork, play with characters you create, or even add yourself to any game by loading your own photo to the piece. The Tabletop Doppelganger can revolutionize the way you play, and the uses for this piece are practically endless.\nI came up with the idea for this piece after many years of playing RPG games that had thousands of monsters to choose from. Even though the gamers I played with had hundreds of figures, we would often lack the just the right ones. We would then have to use replacement tokens or 1\" discs with numbers on them to represent the monster. I saw that this is a common issue among gamers, and I decided to create a substitute that could not only stand in for monsters you do not have in figure form, but also for monsters that did not have figures available to buy.\nI then realized that this piece, with its capacity for holding pictures, could give gamers of all kinds of new way to play and add an entirely new level of creativity to board games.\nUpload your own paintings or photos!\nReward selections less than $100:\nAdd $20 to any reward of less than $100 to receive 1 extra Doppelganger.\nAdd $15 to any reward to add a carrying case.

(Extra Doppelganger and case, add $25)\nNote: Pledges for the $225 reward may not add an extra Doppelganger (Kickstarter limit is 10), but they will receive a free Carrying case!\nAdd $15 to any reward to receive a carrying case!\nThe carrying case has foam and felt interior to protect the doppelganger and other figures.\nConcept to Final Product:\nI have been developing board games for eight years now, and I have also been playing role playing games for almost twenty years. In the last two years, I noticed that one of the biggest problems at my gaming table was the availability of the figures and pieces needed to play the game or complete the quest. Usually, if we didn't have the right figure for a monster or character, we would have to use another figure of a smilar size or use a generic stand in its place. This problem wasn't limited to role playing games, either, as I found that trying to replace missing or broken board game pieces was a common issue for people that enjoy playing board games of all kinds.\nOnce I identified this problem, I set out to make something to solve it. My first idea was a transformable figure, or a Transfomer-like figure that could become multiple characters or game pieces. But after more thought and research it was obvious that this type of figure wasn't going to work - it would be difficult to manufacture and would be limited in the number of figures it could become. But the idea of a single figure that could become or replace multipe figures led me to imagine a virtual table top figure, one that would have a single LCD screen display, lay flat on the game board and allow players to download photos to the piece from a computer via a USB cord. I created a prototype of this 1\"x1\" flat piece with a single LCD screen, but this still did not satisfy my needs, since the LCD screen could not be easily viewed when it lay flat on the table.\nI then came up with the idea for a piece that would stand upright and have not one, but two LCD screens, arranged back to back. I made a few prototypes of this two-screened game piece until I had the base size and thickness in the correct dimensions to support the two screens. Once I had the base, I acquired the parts to make a demo piece that would hold the photos and named this new design the Table Top Doppelganger (TTD).I then contacted a manufacturer from Utah, RPH Engineering, and confirmed that they could provide the pieces, USB cords and packaging for the Doppelganger once I acquired the funding needed to start production. Starting production for this product will cost an estimated $15,000. The final design will be made of a black plastic frame with a 1\"x1\" base that will support 2 LCD display screens back to back.\nManufacturing plan:\nWith the initial $15,000 earned towards my goal of $45,000, I will be able to begin production by working with RPH Engineering. They will use these start-up funds to create molds for the plastic base and frame, assemble the LCD screens and program the devices. They will then provide me with proofs before beginning the intial production run.\nOnce the intital molds and pieces are created and the proofs are approved, I can place an order for additional pieces. I plan to order 1500 once the engineers have the equipment they need, and they will prepackage the Table Top Doppelganger pieces and the USB cords. I will then distribute and sell the first 1500 Doppelgangers, with the goal of selling all of these and eventually ordering and selling 3500 more.\nWith funding and support, it is my hope to expand the Table Top Doppelganger's capacities, functions and design. I would like to eventually look into offering Doppelgangers in different colors other than black, create pieces with a 2\"x2\" or 3\"x3\" base and bases of different shapes, and add to the memory of the Doppelganger so that it can hold more photos.\nGrowing list of uses for the Doppelganger\nDoppelganger Uses\n1.Becomes multiple figures- can hold up to 30 pictures for 30 different figures.\n2.A life counter for collectable card games.\n3.Put yourself into the game.\n4.Post your figure\u2019s stats on the game piece.\n5.Change your figure\u2019s equipment.\n6.Represent your character\u2019s status (raging, singing, sleeping)\n7.Create a board game/RPG game and use TTDs as the game pieces.\n8.Replace a lost board game piece.\n9.

Since I am working with them and not producing the pieces myself, I will need to personally test the product and work out any glitches or bugs before supplying the pieces to customers. This could possibly cause unforseen delays, but I am hoping that by staying in close contact with the manufacturer and immediately addressing any issues that come up that any problems will be quickly resolved.\n\nAlso, the size of our initial run of Dopplegangers will determine when shipments can be sent out, which may delay the release of the first orders.\n\n\nMy mission is to get the base of the Doppleganger as thin as possible, while still keeping the battey life and storage capacity as high as possible. The current battery life for the Doppelganger is about 4 hours of continuous run time, which may not be enough for playing longer games such as role playing games. I am hoping to increase this to 8 hours or more as soon as possible, once the initial proofs and pieces have been produced.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "Doppelganger Update.", "update_content": "Greeting everyone,\nI have 85% of the shipments sent out and just received a lot more units yesterday.

Since every GPS device has a little bit of error the traces get layered on top of each other in a tapestry even when two devices travel the same path. What does that mean? It means freeways and well-travelled routes automatically appear thicker than other routes.\nYou can see midtown in NYC is busy, that the 101 in SF is high-traffic and the stark distinction between land and water in Chicago.\nThe prints themselves use acid-free archival-grade paper and high quality ink. Posters are not framed and will have a plain border to facilitate framing.\nLondon. Can you see the Thames river?\nBerlin. Can you spot an airport?\nRemember, these can be printed for any spot, at any scale (zoom level) you like within the US and the countries in Europe mentioned above.\nMost of the rewards are for major cities, states and countries only.

CHEATIN' marks my 7th animated feature film.\nI've always enjoyed using watercolors in my illustrations, and now, for the first time, I can employ my painterly sensibilities to the treatment of my animation. This loose, almost impressionistic style has never been seen before in my films. Thanks to this new aesthetic and a beautiful, full-length musical score, I believe CHEATIN' will be a breakthrough for my career! Unfortunately this style is very difficult and time-consuming to complete.\nI am an artist and take great pride in my status as an independent filmmaker. I don't work with big production houses and I draw every frame myself. Including my Producer and Art Director, my studio employs 10 artists who need to digitally clean, paint, and composite over 40,000 animation drawings. We have an editor, composer, and sound designer working out-of-house, making the total staff under 20 people \u2013 quite small compared to the thousands on staff at large animation studios such as Pixar or Disney. For these reasons, it's very difficult to raise funds for this project, and that's why we need your support!\nWith your help, we hope to complete this landmark film by next September \u2013 just in time to qualify for the Oscars!\nThank you for your support!\n- Bill Plympton\nEXCLUSIVE KICKSTARTER VIDEO UPDATES\nI will be posting exclusive Kickstarter videos once a week until the end of January. If you back this project, you'll receive an email when a new video is ready to be viewed.

Thankfully, this is something I've never had to do.\n\nThe biggest risk is completing the film by next September with such a small team. I've never colored a film like this before. It's far more time consuming than any of my previous films, so I need to employ more artists.\n\nThis is my first time using Kickstarter to help fund a feature film. $75,000 is the bare minimum we need to move forward.

I decided to rearrange lost treasures from the late 1920s Chicago and Harlem and rearrange them for a 10-piece band I called the Ghost Train Orchestra. It was an incredible run of shows, but because of the size of the band, years went by before I could afford to record and mix it properly. Finally, last year we released our first CD Hothouse Stomp: The Music of 1920s Chicago and Harlem. Following the great success of that album, I was able to break even on the expenses and embark on developing arrangements for a second album.\nBook of Rhapsodies is our second effort, a hugely ambitious concept album of reimaginings of the work of four composers from 1935-1942 whose work straddled the line between jazz and classical music: Alec Wilder, Charlie Shavers, Reginald Foresythe, and Raymond Scott. Their music was unclassifiable, strange, beautiful, adventurous, and innovative. Some of the pieces I chose have not been released since the original 78s and in the case of Alec Wilder and Reginald Foresythe, some of the music has been lost and sadly forgotten.\nUntil now...after 16 months of research, transcribing, and rearranging, I can say that Book of Rhapsodies is my most fully-realized and ambitious project to date. I've retooled these amazing treasures for the Ghost Train Orchestra, 12 members strong. The ensemble includes musicians I've been playing with for many years, who have worked with me in the New York area over the years developing this music through live performances. This time around I brought in bassist Michael Bates (a bandleader himself),violist Tanya Kalmanovitch (Home, Anthony Coleman), and an old friend of 20 years, guitarist Avi Bortnick (of John Scofield's band).\nIn addition, I've added a small choir of vocalists to support the songs, including Yolanda Scott, Katie Seiler, Joe Chappel and Tomas Cruz (both currently on tour with the Philip Glass/Robert Wilson opera Einstein on the Beach.) Last April we were able to record the fundamentals with the orchestra. But that was just the first step. In order to finish the recording and make these orchestral expansions possible, we need your support. This recording is our effort to document the work so this music can have a life beyond the local performances.\nYour donation will go toward the following:\n- Paying the musicians and engineer (see list below) for the studio time\n- Paying for the studio cost to finish recording, mixing, and mastering the album\n- Designing and print beautiful booklets containing original artwork by Noah Woods plus photographs and a history of the music\n- Documenting the studio recordings and performances so that this music can have a life beyond our local performances\nTHE MUSICIANS\nThe album will be engineered and mixed by Grammy-award winner Danny Blume, who mixed and co-produced our first album Hothouse Stomp\u00ad. You'll also be supporting an orchestra made up of a group of incredible musicians who have collectively collaborated with David Byrne, Elvis Costello, Michael Gira, Philip Glass, Frank London, Joe Morris, Swans, Jay-Z, James \"Blood\" Ulmer, and John Zorn.

It's weird and unfamiliar music; not quite big-band swing, not quite early New Orleans polyphony, it rewards the close listener with unexpected twists and turns.\" -- Patrick Jarenwattananon, All Things Considered\nBoston Phoenix Top Ten Jazz Acts of 2011:\"This is music from the heart of the Jazz Age that still has a raucous immediacy. In fact, just about every track on the band's Hothouse Stomp (Accurate) has the hookiness of a pop hit.\" -- Jon Garelick, Boston Phoenix\n\"If your musical tastes lean towards the dance-friendly jazzy, or blues-drenched and blearly (or really, anything in between), this album is a must.\" -- Oliver Amnuayphol, The Sound Room\n\"Carpenter leads a suberb band of New York-based vanguardists and while most of the solos ditch period authenticity and employ a vocabulary that contains ideas from the next 90 years of jazz history, his sharp arrangements retain the contrapuntal flash, sweet voicings, and fiery rhythms of the original era...\" -- Peter Margasak, Downbeat\n\"The music gathered and interpreted on this thoroughly winning disc all comes from a period before the emergence of the big-band jazz sound.Just about every track is full of those kinds of musical treats and surprises, and it all adds up to a relentlessly rollicking good time.\" -- Rick Anderson, All Music Guide\n\"Brian Carpenter is a multi-faceted artist, musician, composer, arranger, film director, radio producer and more. In short, he's a guy who follows his muse. In this case, that muse is jazz of the 1920s and I'm mighty thankful he took this detour. Hothouse Stomp is a loving tip of the cap to some of the unsung greats of Harlem and Chicago's South Side...the only thing better than hearing this recording would be seeing the band live.\" -- Frank Alkyer, Downbeat\n\"A trip through 1920s Chicago and Harlem...Carpenter selected, transcribed, arranged, and conducted tunes made semi-famous by bands that have faded into semi-obscurity...one must stop and remind oneself: This crazy-beautiful living-history lesson sprang from Brian Carpenter's mind. Wow.\" -- Steve Greenlee, Boston Globe\nWATCH A LIVE PERFORMANCE AT JALOPY...\nHere's a video of a live performance from our show at the gorgeous Jalopy Theatre in Brooklyn (filmed shortly after the Kickstarter interview above!)

The PLATINUM LEVEL SPONSORSHIP places your name & logo everywhere, essentially co-branding the race. Because your brand will be tied so closely to ours, this is only available to one company, and only once both companies (Ridiculo.us and you) have talked and come to a mutual agreement. This sponsorship will look different depending on who decides to purchase it, but an initial outline would look something like this:\nPLATINUM SPONSOR - LIMITED QUANTITY - ONE AVAILABLE! - Run Free 2013, presented by... YOUR COMPANY! Yours will be the ONLY corporate logo on the race bibs, plus it will show up on race stationery, all race marketing materials, and will be prominently featured on the race t-shirt and website. Your company will receive a FULL TWO-PAGE SPREAD in the race program, ten entries to the race, a 20' wide finish line banner with your logo on it, AND multiple mentions from our social media accounts on race day! Plus you'll be allowed to insert a flyer or souvenir into every race packet (you provide fliers/souvenirs).\nIf you or your company would be interested in this opportunity, please email ann@ridiculo.us to get the process started.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Full Story\nThere\u2019s a saying on the internet: \u201cPics or it didn\u2019t happen\u201d.\n\nIn other words, if something is real, if it actually happened, there will be pictures to back that up.\n\nBut what if something DIDN\u2019T actually happen, but there are STILL pictures of it? Does that mean it DID happen? If something is fake, how much evidence does it take before it becomes real?\n\nThat\u2019s the question we\u2019re trying to answer.\n\nSo on February 2, 2013, we are faking a marathon. \n\n\nWe\u2019ll have all the trappings of a real marathon - race banners, race t-shirts, race medals, race sponsors, race bibs, a race program... you get the idea. We just won\u2019t have any actual... racing.\nAll of this and more, and NO RUNNING!\n\nWe\u2019re calling it Run Free 2013. Because, well, it\u2019s run-free. It\u2019s free of running.\n\nHere\u2019s how it will work. A few days before the race, you\u2019ll receive your race registration packet containing all the stuff a regular race registration packet would contain: a race program, a race bib, safety pins, etc. Maybe even a race t-shirt if you want one.\n\nYou\u2019ll take a picture of it and post it to instagram, saying something like \u201cJust got my packet for #runfree. Totally stoked, yo!\u201d\nTotally Stoked, Yo!\n\n\nThen, on race day, you\u2019ll throw on some running shorts and a t-shirt, pin on your racing bib number, and take a picture. Then you\u2019ll post something to Facebook like \u201cGetting ready for the race!\" And you'll tag the RunFree page in the post.. Then you can go back to sleep for awhile, or check your email, or eat a donut.\nSpreading the word.\n\n\nA little later, you\u2019ll find a road somewhere and have a friend take a picture of you pretending to run by. \u201cWoo hoo!\u201d they\u2019ll tweet. \u201cCheering on my friend as he/she runs #runfree!\u201d\n\nBut it won\u2019t just be you doing this. Across the country and around the world, hundreds, if not thousands, of other people will be doing the same thing, uploading pictures online, helping amass an insurmountable wall of evidence proving that Run Free 2013 actually happened (even though it really didn't - or did it?).\n\nNot only will participants be inundating facebook, twitter, and instagram with these pictures and posts, but we\u2019ll be curating the best ones before, during and after the race on our site: runfreerace.com. Plus everyone who participates will have their race time listed on the site to prove they were there.\n\nThere are lots of things that are necessary for this to work, from planning the details to producing the shirts and medals and so much more. Most of the stuff, we can take care of. But there are two things we can\u2019t provide on our own: pictures and participants.\n\nOn our own, we could provide a handful of pictures. But the more pictures the race has, the more believable it becomes. Especially if those pictures are coming from a wide variety of sources.\n\n\nThe only way to get a wide variety of sources is to get more participants. Plus, the more people that participate, the more fun it is to be a part of. In fact, we\u2019re hoping some of you will do this with your friends, so we can get shots of 5, 10, or even 20 or more runners in one picture. That\u2019s some pretty convincing propaganda right there.\n\nThe best part is, this is your race, and you get to make it whatever you want it to be. Some of you may stage obstacles, as though this was some intense mud marathon. \nIs this an obstacle race?\nSome of you may set up fake aid stations and have pictures of volunteers waiting to hand out ridiculous refreshments.\nMid-race carb loading?\nIt\u2019s totally up to you. As long as the photos aren\u2019t crude or offensive, they\u2019ll be added to the historical record of the race.\n\nWe want to see how people react and respond. What kind of event will people think this is? Will they buy into it being real, even when a quick Google search will tell them it's not? How far will participants take it?\n\nBut most of all, how many photographs does it take to make a fake marathon real?\nThis project brought to you by:\nRidiculo.us is a participant in Kicking It Forward, an initiative to donate a portion of project profits back into the Kickstarter community. Find out more at www.kickingitforward.org", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenge will be making sure everything gets to our participants in time for the race. Without that, the concept doesn't work. To make sure we accomplish this, we're giving ourselves PLENTY of time (over 2 months from project completion to race day) to make sure we have time to order shirts, bibs, medals, banners, etc. and get them where they need to be in time for the starting pistol to go off.\n\nAdditionally, we're going to have backer surveys ready to go as soon as the project closes (instead of waiting to put together a survey afterwards) so that we can get responses quickly and order the rewards early.\n\nThis presents a second challenge, which is keeping participants excited during the interim. To combat this, we'll be putting out weekly emails with \"race training tips\", challenges, and other ways to engage with the idea and push it forward. We'll even have ways for participants to shape the project during that time, such as posting \"training\" pictures that could be included in the race program, website, and other materials.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "Happy Anniversary!

An Android and Kindle version of our game will be released even if the stretch goals aren't met. We want to provide an opportunity for as many fans to be able to enjoy the game as possible.\nHere's a link to our official update page, feel free to leave comments. We want to make this game the best that it can be, your feedback is important to us!\nCthulhu World Combat Updates\n\u201cCthulhu Still Lives \u2026\u201d   H. P. Lovecraft\n\nMore than a half-century ago, Howard Phillips Lovecraft changed the face of the horror genre forever. Since then, Lovecraft\u2019s works have influenced or inspired every modern horror writer as well as hundreds of horror films, from Alien to In the Mouth of Madness to Hellboy. His most famous creation is the Cthulhu Mythos, a cosmos filled with alien and interdimensional horrors. Lovecraft encouraged other authors to use the Mythos in their own writings, and it has spread like a fungal growth, inspiring books, comics, movies,      and of course, games. \nIn the Mythos, a terrifying variety of alien entities, species, and even gods are constantly threatening humanity\u2019s existence. But humanity is not seen by these beings as an enemy \u2013 more of an irrelevance. These alien horrors do not even always obey the natural laws of our universe, and have inconceivable powers. To our perception, they seem foul and horrible, but their actual motivations are unthinkable.  \n\nInspired by this work, Sandy Petersen got his start in gaming by developing a tabletop roleplaying game based on the Cthulhu Mythos. This game was named Call of Cthulhu after one of Lovecraft\u2019s stories and has proved a cult success over the years. His upcoming game, Cthulhu World Combat,           is the next chapter in this beloved mythos.\n\nWith your help, we hope to expand the game to other platforms someday,   and this process will be greatly accelerated if we meet the appropriate   stretch goals. \nToday, our mission is to create a great strategy/horror game for the iOS system (iPad/iPhone) that Lovecraft himself would be proud to play.     Cthulhu World Combat is the first Cthulhu Mythos product in which YOU play as one of these alien gods yourself. The game takes place after the Old Ones have returned to the Earth. You strive to occupy the world for yourself, and compete with the other forces of destruction A.K.A. your friends.        Only one can control the ruins of Earth in the end.\n    \nLike the Cthulhu Mythos, turn-based strategy gaming has survived the test of time. From Empire to Civilization to Heroes of Might and Magic, we have enjoyed these games. The idea behind Cthulhu World Combat is to take this basic game system and apply it to the Cthulhu Mythos. In terms of gameplay, Cthulhu World Combat probably resembles the Nintendo product Advance Wars more than any other game, but, predictably, Sandy Petersen\u2019s twisted mind has added some significant innovations. \nIf you are not familiar with Advance Wars, it is a top-down turn-based strategy game in which the players produce aircraft, tanks, and ships and then try to destroy their enemies and capture their base. The most obvious difference in Cthulhu World Combat is that you are producing monsters, cultists, and other such creatures instead of mechanized weapons. In Advance Wars, all factions have access to the same weapons. But in Cthulhu World Combat, each faction has its own loyal monsters unique to it.\nCthulhu World Combat is a multiplayer game, though it also supports singleplayer. Turns are short, lasting only a few minutes at the most, so you can take a short break to play a turn at any time during the day or night. You can have many games going on at once, as with other turn-based iOS games such as Words With Friends.\nBehind every great project, there is a talented team driven by a shared dream. Our dream started over 30 years ago, when Sandy got his start in the game industry in the early 1980s, where he first designed paper roleplaying games. His best-known work from that time is the cult game Call of Cthulhu, which has been translated into many languages and is still played world-wide. He also worked on many other roleplaying projects, such as Runequest and Elfquest, and was instrumental in the creation of dozens of supplements and game aids.\n \nIn 1988, he left paper games for the computer game world. He has worked for Microprose, id Software, and Ensemble Studios, where he was involved with Civilization, Doom, Quake, and the Age of Empire series, among others.\nEventually Sandy partnered with the techno-whiz Drew Fisher of Barking\nLizards Technologies, with the shared goal to unite his design lore with the\nconvenience of mobile gaming. With Barking Lizards' expertise, Cthulhu World Combat will not only be a terrific social game, but will be easy and fun to play with modern hand-held systems.\nWith the support of a core team of industry veterans, Sandy\u2019s passion for   both digital gaming and Lovecraft will be combined in their dream project \u2013 Cthulhu World Combat.\n\nThis team has a proven track record, and our members\u2019 games have sold tens of millions of copies worldwide, and has received dozens of awards from the game industry.\nBoard Games, Roleplaying Games, & Film:\nThe Whisperer in Darkness film \\ Petersen\u2019s Guide to Creatures of the Dreamlands \\ Petersen\u2019s Guide to Monsters \\ Arkham Horror \\ Ghostbusters roleplaying game \\ RuneQuest 3rd edition \\ Elfquest roleplaying game \\ Call of Cthulhu \\ Over 30 paper game supplements and products from 1981-1988\n\nVideo Games:\nAge of Empires 3 \\ Halo Wars \\ Quake \\ Age of Mythology \\ Rise of Rome \\ SiN \\ LUXOR \\ Doom \\ Tony Hawk 1 N64 \\ Doom 2 \\ X-Men  Legends 1 \\ Symbian \\ Civilization \\ Age of Empires 2 \\ Dr. Floyd\u2019s Desktop Toys \\ Star Trek Elite Force II \\ The Titans \\ Sid Meier\u2019s Pirates    The Conquerors \\ Sponge Bob PSP, PS2 \\ Spiderman N64 \\ Hexen \\ Heavy Metal F.A.K.K. 2 \\ Elder Scrolls Oblivion \\ J2ME, Brew \\ Duke Nukem 3D \\ Snakes 2 NGI Symbian \\ Lightspeed \\ X-Men Legends 2  Symbian \\ CounterStrike CZ / Xbox \\ C & C 10th Edition PC \\ SiN Episodes \\ Activision Anthology PS2, PC \\ Fallen Shadows \\ Darklands \\ The Bank iOS \\ Osiris Legends iOS \\ Command HQ \\ Super Collapse! 3 DS \\ Girlz Really Rock DS \\ Monster Truck Madness N64 \\ Fox Motocross J2ME, Brew \\ El Tigre DS \\ Blair Witch \\ Hyperspeed     \\ Sword of the Samurai \\ Midnight Mysteries \\ Shrek 2 Mobile J2ME \\ The War Chiefs \\ Spiderman 2 Japan-PSP \\ Bratz Diamonds DS, GBA \\ Zoey 101 DS, GBA \\ Marvel Ultimate Alliance GBA \\ Create DSiWare \\ Bratz Babies GBA \\ Muhammad Ali J2ME, Brew \\ Tony Hawk 2 N64 \\ Bratz 4 Real DS \\ Rock University PS2,Wii,PC \\ 25 to Life \\ Bob Esponja PSP \\ Bratz Diamonds DS\nPart of what makes this project and team so special is that Tom Sullivan has signed on to help!\n\nThose of you who remember the old Call of Cthulhu game and its supplements should be well aware of the terrific art of Tom Sullivan. He illustrated products from Shadows of Yog-Sothoth to Petersen\u2019s Field Guide to Monsters. He is THE definitive artist to illustrate the Mythos and its horrors. He has worked on many projects, including a majority of the effects created for the cult films The Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2, plus he did significant work on Army of Darkness. Those who purchased the Special Edition of the Evil Dead DVD received a copy of Tom\u2019s great Necronomicon tome, complete with illustrations.\n\nIn Cthulhu World Combat, Tom will be illustrating all-new visuals for the game. His illustrations will be design inspiration, and also be used as Kickstarter prizes. Also, Tom will be hand-crafting an all-new Necronomicon tome, which will house various Lovecraftian writings plus include a light strategy guide to the game, a behind-the-scenes look at the game\u2019s making, and unique art from the creative team. Who knows, there might even be a surprise or two from Great Cthulhu himself!\nThe Necronomicon tome will be included as a downloadable PDF for some of the reward funding tiers. If we reach our final stretch goal, it will be made available for fans to enjoy in print.\nAs you can see, a lot of talented people want to make this game! More than anything!! Part of our journey leading up to this moment came from Sandy\u2019s trips to game conventions every year, and his personal connections to Cthulhu fans from around the world (after all he is one of them.) One of the most common questions he gets asked is, \u201cWhen are you going to do something with Cthulhu again?\u201d Here are Sandy\u2019s own words about this:\n\n\u201cUp until now, I had to answer this question lamely, muttering something about \u2018Someday\u2019 or \u2018I guess Cthulhu isn\u2019t mainstream enough for my company to let me do it\u2019. But now is the time. I have partnered with a small group of like-minded, talented developers, and now I can do a Cthulhu product that I am really excited about. More than anything, I want to make this game, and so does the team. We have grandiose ideas for expansions and elaborations, but they can only happen after the first step \u2013 getting Cthulhu World Combat off the ground.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the Mythos that has caught our love, but the strategy game accompanying it. So the game will be as strong as the topic. Along the development cycle (around 6 months), we will continue to keep you updated on the progress, with updates, game visuals as they come online and a running blog which will help keep you engaged in the process.\nOur long-term plan is given below. Please inspect the stretch goals. Not only do we want to bring this game to life, we are trying to ensure that it can be experienced with all worlds, factions and characters of the Cthulhu Mythos on every platform you like. Help us reach these Stretch Goals and you too can participate in the release of a horror not seen on this planet in eons.\nIf your love for Cthulhu and strategy games weren\u2019t enough incentive, we are throwing everything but Sandy's suspenders, your way. As a shameless THANK YOU in helping us make our dream game, you too will be rewarded with these amazing prizes.\nTons of goodies, and if you want to know more about each item, check out the list on the right of the page. More information to come in the next few weeks... who knows, we might add more items to sweeten the deal.\nSpecial Shirt Add-On\nWe are excited to announce a Cthulhu World Combat T-Shirt Add-On! There are multiple shirts to choose from, including an original \"Cthulhu-Tarian\" just in time for the election! You can choose one shirt, just add $20 to your donation! The full list of characters will include at least one from each faction!\nThere are tons of fans who want to see this game made, and we know we're the right team to accomplish the mission, but don't take our word for it...\nOver the last several years traditional game publishers have become increasingly \u201crisk-averse\u201d in funding new IP. As a result a lot of interesting and profitable concepts never see the light of day. Sadly, the traditional investing community is also far less likely to fund concepts of a frightening or horrific nature. When Sandy and his team try to present a Cthulhu-based product to potential investors, they are usually more puzzled than entranced. We have also tried to present the concept of the light strategy game, with more success. But one thing we have found is that investors nowadays are extremely unadventurous in areas where their minds dare not travel.\n\nKickstarter is an evolution in the way that new ideas go from paper to product that may someday obviate traditional seed funding and early stage investing. Not only does it allow new idea an improved chance for birth but it gives anyone the power to be part of something new with little risk. The Cthulhu Mythos is loved by horror fans around the world but is woefully under-represented in today\u2019s vast catalog of available video games. With the help of Kickstarter, we plan to address this egregious omission and take it several strides further.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGiven the experience of the team we have assembled, all of the typical execution risks are not only understood but have already been addressed. In addition, technology, tools and a prototype have been developed so all money we receive from our honored investors on Kickstarter can go directly to the implementation of our dream.\n\nSo, regarding risks -- it\u2019s all about making a great game! Below is a list of issues we are currently anticipating. We have talked a bit about how we plan to address these.\n\n\n1) If every faction has its own unique line-up of units, how will the game be balanced? Won\u2019t some factions be stronger than others? One of Sandy\u2019s main design tasks throughout his career has been to balance units and factions for strategy games. He has spent many thousands of hours doing this, and is confident he can pull it off with Cthulhu World Combat as well. We want to create a great game and work with the player community (of which we are part) to seek out issues and eradicate them quickly and without mercy. \n\n2) If an opponent delays in his response, several hours or days could take place between turns. How will players remember what they were doing? In a simpler game like Chess or Words With Friends this isn\u2019t usually a problem, but in a strategy title there is a lot going on. When you fire up Cthulhu World Combat to react to an opponent\u2019s move, the game starts out by actually showing you that move in double-time. You can replay it, plus you can replay earlier turns if you need your memory refreshed. In fact, you can replay the entire game up to the present point if you wish, pausing it or speeding it up as necessary. Thus you will always be able to see exactly what has been happening and plan your strategy accordingly.\n\n3) One of the flaws of games such as Advance Wars and Civilization is the tedious end-game \u2013 at some point it is obvious that one side is going to win, and then the play is simply dragged out until finally the end comes. Sandy has addressed this issue with a feature known as the Ritual of Annihilation. When one player has significantly more controlled gates than his opponent, he can enact the Ritual. This ceases all his production, but sets up a timer. When the timer counts down a certain number of turns, then he automatically wins. His opponent can cancel the Ritual by recapturing enough gates, but of course you can try to block this. In this way, the end-game is an exciting race for whether you can finish your Ritual before your foe\u2019s counterattack succeeds, rather than a boring slog.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Sandy Petersen\n32 created \u00b7 123 backed\nSandy Petersen got his start at Chaosium in the early 1980s, where he helped develop the original Arkham Horror board game.

This is their job and if I expect them to work on this as if it is their job, I have to pay them as if it is their job...because it is. All of these people working on this have made art their life, they have studied their crafts, they have become masterful at what they do and they need to be able to make a living doing it. Finding a balance where I am understanding of their hectic schedules but still able to require enough rehearsal and man-hours so the performance shines as bright as it can is much easier when I treat them with the respect (both personally and financially) that they deserve.\n\nI am very fortunate to have the support of Town Hall which eliminates the typically daunting venue and promotional fees and I feel I have a unique opportunity here to show that you can make bold moves in art in a financially sustainable way.

It celebrates the life and legacy of choreographer Jessi Donley\u2019s late cousin, Jimmy Donley, a lost legend who passed at the young age of thirty-three. In his short life, Jimmy wrote and performed countless R&B songs of the Mississippi Delta. While some of Jimmy\u2019s tunes were made famous by Antoine \u201cFats\u201d Domino, others were left unrecorded, and many were recorded without giving Jimmy his due credit. Rather than telling Jimmy\u2019s tragic life story as others have done before, Let Me Told You revives and celebrates Jimmy\u2019s musical contributions and talents.\nJimmy Donley & Fats Domino\nLet Me Told You is an exciting collaboration between the dance and music communities in New Orleans. A cast of eleven comes together with five musicians and six dancers, interacting together on stage as they all work collectively to take the audience on a comedic, sensual and gritty journey. Let Me Told You will be performed at the New Orleans Fringe Festival from November 14-18 2012.\nLet Me Told You dancers\nThe process of bringing this piece together has taken a great deal of time and energy put forth by the dancers, and especially the musicians. This Kickstarter campaign is seeking to raise $3,000 to cover the cost of producing this evening-length, collaborative work. The majority of the funding will go towards securing and compensating the musicians for the hours of energy they have put into rehearsals as well as the four upcoming performances at the Fringe Festival. Funding will also be given to the six dancers for their work as well as to recognize and fulfill the need to compensate professional dancers in the increasingly growing dance community in New Orleans. \nJimmy & Fats making a record\nIn addition to compensating musicians and dancers for their work on Let Me Told You, the rest of the Kickstarter grant will go towards the production costs of Let Me Told You, including publicity, props, costumes, and the set. $3,000 is the bare minimum needed to pull off a show of this quality, rich history, and length, and we are excited for the opportunity to receive help from interested individuals and organizations seeking to support the New Orleans music and dance communities.\nLet Me Told You is the first full-length production of Dancing Grounds' resident Contemporary dance company, Donley Dance Project, led by Jessi Donley.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are very few risks and challenges to completing our project once it is funded. Let Me Told You has already been promised a venue and been backed by the New Orleans Fringe Festival (nofringe.org) as an official Fringe production, which will premiere from November 14-18, 2012. The permits for the venue have already been secured, the dancers and musicians have been secured, rehearsals are well under way, the production has been fully planned and promoted. Let Me Told You has already received local press attention from New Orleans Magazine and the Times-Picayune. Once we receive Kickstarter funding, we will able to pay the performers and therefore confidently secure all of their participation, completing the final stage of the production process. Barring any natural disasters (less likely for New Orleans in November), mass illness among several key cast members or widespread apocalyptic happenings, the show will go on! If such unlikely events should happen, the production would be postponed to a later date.

Did you know that there are 562* Federally recognized Tribal Nations in the United States?  My goal is to create a publication and exhibition representing  Native people from every tribe. But really, the ultimate goal is education. If you support our kickstarter, then together we can move a step closer toward abolishing negative stereotypes, honoring tradition, and leaving legacy.\nWalk The Red Road\nOn The Road\nStarting in December of 2012, I will be hitting the road, \u2026 I will begin in Washington State, and work my way South through Oregon, Idaho, California, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico, Arizona, until I have visited all 52 states, all 562 Federally Recognized Tribes in this nation. I will travel in my RV, fully equipped with a photographic studio, darkroom and sleeping quarters.\nWith Your Support...\n If I have the honor of receiving your donation, I will use your funds for travel expenses, for film and dark-room supplies; and for website development. Every contribution is deeply appreciated, even if it\u2019s only a few dollars\u2014 that few dollars may get us another gallon of gas, which will get us a few miles closer to the next tribe. So Thank-you for your time, and for your generosity; I am so grateful that you had a look!\nAbout KickStarter\nKickstarter is an all or nothing kind of gal.... either you raise all of your goal, and you get to receive your pledges, or you don't reach your goal, and you don't get anything.... \nAbout Matika\nMatika Wilbur is a member of the Tulalip Tribe. She was raised on the Swinomish Indian Reservation in Washington State, graduated from La Conner high school, studied photography at the Rocky Mountain School of Photography in Montana and the Brooks Institute of Photography in California. She has exhibited extensively in region, national, and international venues such as the Royal British Columbia Museum of Fine Arts, the Nantes Museum of Fine Arts in France, the Seattle Art Museum, the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture, and the Kittredge Gallery at the University of Puget Sound.\n\nWilbur's work contends with how Native peoples shape a sense of identity in the face of cultural dualities; how a hybrid sense of identity that honors one's cultural heritage and connects to contemporary, pop culture. She says, \"My name, Matika, means the messenger, and throughout my life, I have been groomed to approach the politics of our society differently-- I am to influence social change not as a politician, but as an artist. These projects are important because questions are being asked and documented that might otherwise be overlooked. It is the intimacy of the studio, the presence of the camera and connection that the subject feels with me that allows the honesty and vulnerability to be present in every image. I have grown tremendously from visiting the wisdom of my culture, and I believe that everybody that views these images will have this truth. These images will leave a legacy that will be remembered for many years to come. \"\n\nWilbur's honest, emotionally complex photographs provide a means of reconciling, reckoning, and continually revisiting this question.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are several potential challenges with a project of this nature; our main concern is the amount of ground that we actually have to cover in the time frame. We have 1,095 days to complete this project; which means we need to visit about four different tribes per week to finish shooting by August of 2015. We also plan on visiting several potlatches, pow-wow's and gatherings to exponentiate our numbers. 562 is broken down into four phases:\n\nPhase 1: Pre-Production (current stage) \n1) Gain Support of Tribal Communities, Educators and Museums \n\n\u2022 I am currently creating a $15,000 proposal for Tulalip\u2019s Charitable Contribution Fund, and will submit in the month of November.\n\n\u2022 I have gained the support of The Seattle Art Museum, The Burke Museum of Natural History and The Tacoma Art Museum; with tentative exhibit dates in the year of 2015.\n\n3) Fund Raise $70,000 for Production Phase \n\u2022To date we have raised $16,000.\n\u2022 We've also applied for the Native Arts and Culture Foundation grant, and intend to apply for the Potlatch Fund.\n\n4) Plan Expedition and Reach out to Tribal Communities we plan to visit\n\u2022 This is the most challenging of all, which is finding people to work with all over the United States and let them know we are coming.\n\n\nPhase 2: Production, December of 2012 \u2013 August of 2014 \n1) Visit all 562 Tribes.\n\n2) With gained momentum and material I will continue fundraising for the following years of travel.\n\nPhase 3: Post-Production, Fall of 2015 \n1) Edit and Print Photographs\n2) Create Curriculum\n3) Develop Book\n4) SEND MY SUPPORTERS THEIR REWARDS\n5) Curate Exhibit\n6) Fundraise\n7) Create Marketing Materials\n\n\nPhase 4: Final Stage- Exhibition\n Exhibit Photographs.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #16", "update_userinfo": "Project 562 2017 Summer Update", "update_content": "Project 562 remains dedicated to Changing The Way We See Native America in our mission to create an unprecedented repository of imagery and oral histories that accurately portray contemporary Native Americans from over 562 tribal nations.

He started with the idea of the great romantic song cycle Winterreise (winter journey)\u2014Schubert\u2019s long walk out into the cold\u2014and fused it with the ethos of Frank Sinatra\u2019s \u201csuicide song\u201d LP\u2019s with Nelson Riddle from the 1950\u2019s (particularly Only the Lonely). The winter landscape is replaced by a mythical bar at 2:45am, with a man haunted by the past and searching for something, singing sad and beautiful songs with a ten-piece band from a dark corner of heaven. Despite the cozy environs, the singer is \u201cout cold\u201d in the sense of being an outcast, and in the sense of being unconscious, even in his waking moments. READ MORE ABOUT THE INFLUENCES AND ARTISTRY BEHIND OUT COLD.\nThis is the same composer who wrote Zippo Songs, right?\nYep! In fact, Out Cold will be presented on a double-bill with Kline\u2019s Zippo Songs (\"One of the most brutally frank song cycles ever penned.\" Alex Ross, THE NEW YORKER), heard in its entirety for the first time in Kline's arrangement for string quintet, piano and percussion. The new scoring, called \u201cluminous\u201d by The New York Times, reveals subtle shades of color without losing any of the original\u2019s punch.The 2004 CD release of Zippo Songs was on top ten lists from The New York Times, Gramophone, Newsday, WNYC, TimeOut NY, and many others. Read the reviews\nSo when is it?\nOut Cold/Zippo Songs will run from Thursday, October 25 through Saturday, October 27 at 7:30 PM. An artist panel discussion will follow the Friday, October 26 performance. Tickets are $20 and available at www.bam.org/OutColdZippo. These will be among the first performances in BAM\u2019s spectacular Richard B. Fisher Building (321 Ashland Place), a state-of-the-art black box theater recently profiled by the New York Times.\nACME players for Out Cold / Zippo Songs are Keats Dieffenbach, Ben Russell, and Caleb Burhans, violins; Nadia Sirota, viola; Clarice Jensen, cello; Logan Coale, bass; Alex Sopp, flute; Michelle Farah, oboe; Timothy Andres, piano; and Chris Thompson, percussion.\nAOP (operaprojects.org) co-commissioned Out Cold.  The production team comprises stage director Emma Griffin (Opera Company of Philadelphia, Juilliard Opera, Williamstown Theater Festival); production and costume designer Andrea Lauer (B'way, Off-B'way, El Paso Opera, Trey McIntyre Dance); Mike Inwood (lighting designer); and Todd Eskridge (sound engineer).\nWhy do you need to help?\nAs Phil mentions, BAM is presenting us in their new state-of-the-art theater, but they pay only for the performances. The cost of the production itself, the writing, design, lights. set, etc., is on our tab.\nWhat If I Have No Idea How Kickstarter Works?\nIf you're not familiar with Kickstarter or how it will work, here's a brief overview (or you can read the official one, here). For the next 30 days, you'll be able to make pledges to help support this project, ranging from $1 to whatever you can afford without your spouse/parent/financial advisor slapping you. For your pledge, you can select one of the reward packages\u2014listed to the right\u2014of equal or lesser value to your pledge. You can always pledge more than the minimum to get a reward if you want (and for some packages, you'll need to do so if it must be shipped internationally). Your credit card or other account will not actually be charged at the time you make your pledge, and you can change your mind right up to the final deadline.\nIf the final deadline comes and we've reached our goal, then everyone gets charged the amount they pledged at once and we begin putting together all those nifty rewards for you (along with producing our show, of course). But if for some reason we don't meet our goal, then the whole thing is called off. No one gets charged, no fees are applied, everyone just keeps their money. Of course, if we fail to meet the goal, then no one gets any rewards, either, and some of those rewards are pretty cool, in our highly biased opinion.\nIs my donation tax-deductible? \nAmerican Opera Projects is an IRS recognized 501(c)3 non-profit corporation. All donations are tax-deductible, minus the expenses of any rewards you receive. If the project meets its Kickstarter goal, you will receive a letter declaring your donation once we have received all funds.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #16", "update_userinfo": "\"Out Cold\" makes Best of 2012 list in New York Times & WXQR", "update_content": "\"Out Cold\" continues to garner great reviews and is now showing up on some best of the year lists!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #15", "update_userinfo": "David Patrick Stearns review and rewards update...", "update_content": "It's been over a week now since we finished Out Cold / Zippo Songs, but we haven't forgotten our faithful supporters who made it happen.

Ignacio Quiles aka Sartorial Pairings here.\nSome of you may know me from Failure Club online. Some of you may know me from Artists & Fleas, Hester Street Fair or The Market NYC in New York City. And some of you have been my friends for years. But what you may not know is that I have had a long-held desire to launch a menswear line and open a haberdashery. I\u2019ve been working on the retail part of my dream at my New York City based vintage emporium QP & Monty.\nNow I\u2019m ready to take the plunge, overcome my fear of failure, and launch Sartorial Pairings my menswear brand.\nBut I need your help!!\nSARTORIAL INSPIRATION\nEveryday I work with customers from all over the world. Some are dandies like me and some are not. Some love all the sartorial flourishes and some do not. But I find that they all want to feel pulled together. It is for all of them that I have been inspired to launch Sartorial Pairings.\nPhotographer: Oriana DeAmicis, Model: Danny Lane\nSARTORIAL OFFERINGS\nSartorial Pairings will initially include a capsule collection of vests and bow ties and fobs and chains. I decided to start with vests because I believe they are a wardrobe staple. They work for everyone whether you are more comfortable in jeans and tees or in a full on three-piece ensemble. But well fitting examples can be hard to find \u2013 many are not long enough for today\u2019s low cut pants and many do not cinch properly in the back. Additionally, I find that a lot of my customers admire my style and the antique Victorian and Edwardian accessories I wear. But they\u2019re never quite sure how to use them in their daily lives and, on top of that, they don\u2019t want to pay the high cost of true antiques.\nHANDMADE IN NYC, USA \u2013 WITH A LOT OF HELP FROM MY FRIENDS\nSince I learned to sew as a kid from my mother I knew what I wanted to  design for myself, but I wasn\u2019t sure how to get a sample or a pattern made. So I did my research and found an amazing woman, Zoila Cruz of Zoila's Sample Room, right here in NYC who is helping me realize my vision.\nShe is working to keep manufacturing alive in NYC and I want to help.\nShe made the first vest pattern and sample for me \u2013 two additional versions are on the drawing table \u2013 and she stands ready to produce the line.\nFive Pocket Pinstripe Vest - No Lapel and Double Breasted Versions will also be Available in Three Different Fabric Choices\nSpecial Edition Kickstarter Only Bow Tie\nAlso I love jewelry and have quite a collection much of which I\u2019ve modified on my own. But I didn\u2019t know anything about this production process either. So I asked my friends Ronnie Aminov and Cynthia Catera, the designers behind FSMNYC, the hip urban jewelry that\u2019s been tearing it up at markets all over the East Coast, to help me out.\nFobs and Chains will be Available in Single (12\") and Double (24\") Versions in Three Different Finishes\nTogether we\u2019re reinventing old school accessories for 21st century lives and making them right here in NYC as well!\nWith your support of my Kickstarter campaign we\u2019ll be able to realize my dream and launch Sartorial Pairings in the Fall of 2012. Initially, I plan to produce two variations of fobs in three finishes\u2013 the Albert (12\u201d chain) and Double Albert (24\u201d chain) \u2013 and three variations of vests \u2013 single breasted with lapel, single breasted without lapel and double-breasted -- in three fabric choices in the following sizes: S, M, L, XL.\nHOW WILL I SPEND THE MONEY?\nSpecifically your contribution will help me:\nhave the samples and patterns made for the next two vest styles - no lapel single-breasted and double-breasted\ngrade the patterns\nmake the molds for the decorative elements of the fobs - medallion and animal motifs\nproduce the decorative elements of the fobs\npurchase chain and fabric\nmanufacture of the first run of vests and fobs\noffset labor costs of creating the line\npay for the studio and photographer to shoot the collection\nfund reward fulfillment including shipping and production costs of pocket squares and bow ties\nsupport design and printing of promotional materials including developing the sales presentation kit for wholesale sales\nWHAT WILL YOU GET IN RETURN?\nIn exchange for your support I\u2019ve come up with some awesome rewards that range from acknowledgement on our website and Kickstarter-only pocket squares and bow ties to special packages that include a styling and makeover session with me in NYC. Moreover this is the best opportunity to get in on the first run of vests and fobs by ordering them now through this campaign.\nSpecial Edition Kickstarter Only All Cotton Pocket Square Designed in Collaboration with Matt Shapoff of Handmade on Peconic Bay Featuring a Photograph of Me Taken by Joel Henderson of Shoot Me Please Photo\nMost importantly you will have the satisfaction of helping revive manufacturing in NYC, USA and of course you\u2019ll receive my undying gratitude for support of our work.\nAll friends and backers of the campaign will have access to project updates and insider information on Kickstarter. I look forward to corresponding with you and maybe even meeting you at a launch event in a few months. Thank you in advance for your support!! \n\u201cEnjoy what you wear. Wear what you enjoy. Then go out and show the world exactly what you\u2019re made of!\u201d\nKICKSTARTER IS AN ALL-OR-NOTHING PROPOSITION: SO HELP ME SHARE THE LOVE\nAnd remember Kickstarter is an all-or-nothing funding platform so I\u2019ll be doubly grateful if you share the 411 about my campaign for Sartorial Pairings with your friends!!\nFind out more by:\nChecking out my retail website!\nLiking us on facebook!\nContacting us on twitter!\nReading my blog!\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS OR MANY THANKS!\nI couldn't have come close to launching this project without the support of many many artists and friends. My partner Pamela Moore and I began this journey two and a half years ago and we owe a debt of gratitude to Mike Ricatto of the Meeker Avenue Flea Market, Suhyun and Suchin Pak of the Hester Street Fair, Ronen Glimer of Artists & Fleas, David Ornstein and Maureen McGill of the Manhattan Vintage Clothing Show, Metalbelly Michael Ginsberg at Chelsea Market, Nicolas Petrou and Alex Pabon of The Market NYC for welcoming us into the family of artists, collectors and makers that populate the markets they curate. \nI've also had the great pleasure of being captured by a number of great photographers, artists and filmmakers including Joel Henderson of Shoot Me Please Photo, Bill Gentle of Backyard Bill, Rog Walker and Bianca Pandit of Speaking Pixels, Dash Harris, Andrew Jordan, Dustin Cohen, Helene Pe and Stephen Chew of The Chew Chronicles. Their work has inspired me and helped me hone my vision.\nThis past year I also had the great honor of being selected by Morgan Spurlock to participate in his web series about Philip Kiracofe's Failure Club. I could not have achieved half as much as I have in the past year without the prodding and cheerleading of my fellow cast mates  -- Elizabeth Chan, Eric Norlander, Gina Bruce, Jessica Hayden, Liz Picarazzi, and Meg Ferrill -- and the crew who really have to put up with me and my fiercely independent nature. You guys all inspire me!\nMost importantly Sartorial Pairings the brand is a collaborative effort. And I owe an debt of gratitude to Ray Marrero of the serif design for his incredible branding work, Oriana DeAmicis for her amazing product shots and her friend Danny Lane for modeling the vests and chains, Ricky Becker of The Spooky Boutique for his styling mentorship, Andre Wagner of abstract elements for our killer kickstarter video, Andrea Diaz, Marc Anderson, Stephen Anderson and Tomas Diaz of the band City on Fire for allowing me to use their song The Road as the soundtrack,  Zoila Cruz for bringing my vest to life and Ronnie Amanov and Cynthia Catera for producing the fobs and chains, 3rd ward in Brooklyn for the classes and room to hone my creativity, Mechlin Moore for seeing our project's potential, Matt Shapoff for designing the fabric for my exclusive-to-kickstarter pocket square and Cynthia Rybakoff-Shapoff for her jewelry design consultation and support of our vision! And to my newest collaborators Jonathan de Castro for his guidance and assistance with marketing of our campaign, Janice Lim for her marketing and event expertise along with her discerning eye for vintage, and Alexandra Johnson from Kent State University for offering to be our intern -- I hope it's an exciting ride for everyone.\nI also need to give a shout out to Moustache Greenwich Tonsorial and Teddy Telles Photography for helping make some of my most awesome rewards true experiences. Additionally I need to thank Ariel Elias for her design and merchandising assistance and constant inspiration!!

I am giving back to my community of Pahokee, Florida so the kids and my community can have a better future.   I have teamed up with Robot Hustle Crew to use technology tools to link Pahokee with the resources we need to be successful.\nOUR GOAL: To plant a community garden and show the world that positive progress happens through teamwork.  We are committed to improving our community, rebuilding, and making lasting changes that include sustainable economic development.  Our community garden will create jobs and provide job training, as well as providing positive activities for the youth.  Join us as we create a new future for Pahokee, Fl.  \nWHERE THE FUNDS GO:   We are installing our garden with the help of Urban Greenworks of Miami who run five successful Miami urban gardens.  The Miami gardens sell their products to local restaurants.  We chose them because we want to become self-sustainable.  \nThe Pahokee garden will be maintained by members of our community, who have already volunteered.  All of Pahokee is behind this project and we are excited to get started.  As a community we have met and decided what crops we would like to grow.  We will make connections with regional farmers markets to sell our crop so that we can re-invest in our community.  \nOur goal is to be self-sufficient, and that our garden will yield enough crops to sell and to re-plant next year.  We are also working on getting grants to develop the business aspects. One idea we have to bottle hot sauce from our peppers, thus giving people jobs and a chance to have a small business that is sustainable.  We also want to have the kids of Pahokee participate in the blog and  gardening projects so they can learn technology skills and teamwork skills to help them with their future.\n<more about community gardens and benefits>\nOUR INSPIRATION: We believe in positive change through positive steps. What children see gives them an idea of what they can be.  We want to share our vision with the world to prove things can get better when people care about their communities and work together.\nAt U of M, I learned so much. However, two of the most important things I learned was leadership and the importance of being a role model. I hope to pass along my knowledge and teachings from U of M to Pahokee by coordinating my community and recording how Pahokee is coming together in making positive changes for the future. The world is full of opportunities, and although sometimes it is a difficult journey, I know, just as in football, hard work and dedication produces positive results.\nWatch as we move through each phase and create our garden space. We will share with you through an ongoing multi-media art blog (videos, photos, and writing) that details our progress as we work through our project.  There will be a downloadable multi-media report at the end of the first growing season and we hope you share the information with everyone you know.  Together we can make this happen.  Positive moves Progress.  We will transform Pahokee.\n(All rewards shirts/hoodies are available in WOMENS and MENS and KIDS.  You will get a survey on sizes and colors.

We have been working to get grants and network with other people in our community. One of the big things we did in the fall was take a grant class. It was a series of classes including topics like community building, outreach and networking, of course a lot on paperwork, and comprehensive lessons about the underlying issues that face communities like mine. We also talked about how to address issues that come with race and cultural differences as well as poverty and violence. For example, there was a women in our community who had a large tree in her yard and there was an issue with strangers coming to find shade and hang out. Usually when people gather in our town they are up to no good. So she saw that people had a need for trees and shade from the sun and thats why they were there. Instead of arresting people for trespassing, the community came together to get grants to plant trees. These are the ways in which we can heal our communities."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #8", "update_userinfo": "Pictures from our Garden", "update_content": "Hello world,\nThese last few weeks we have been installing our garden.

It is called C2C (community to community) Vincent Smith teaches painting and we wanted to continue connecting the wolverine community with the Pahokee Community.

A big part of setting up the Garden is to get the land approved by the city as a place we can do the project and also we needed to reach an agreement with the land owners about the use of the land.  \nWe also drove around Pahokee through the different projects where I grew up because an important part of the Garden is involving the community.  I want each garden bed to be a representation of a project in Pahokee.

The short answer is that we are aiming to have everything packed and shipped by the end of this weekend.

When we designed the rewards, we wanted to offer lots of options, including women's sizes and a variety of prints.   So, one unexpected delay (that we didn't even think of) was that we had to wait for all surveys to be turned back, so that we could order in bulk.   We think that we can all agree that the rewards are the bonus, and our real focus is the Garden.  Therefore, we were faced with putting in smaller orders and paying more, or waiting and putting in one big order.

Everything has been upgraded and reworked from the top down.  The Brimstone deck featured gold metallic ink, similarly, the Quicksilvers will be trimmed with metallic silver ink.  All of the elements of the deck have been updated to fit with this new design but remain within the same theme as the Brimstone deck.  Court cards, aces, even the numbered cards have custom work that will look right at home next to the Brimstone deck or will be the gleaming highlight of your collection.  \nI've been working in graphic design for just over a decade and have been collecting cards for nearly as long.  Printing my own design through the best card manufacture out there (United States Playing Card Co.) is a hefty investment. This is where I need your help!  With your pledges I will deliver to you a high quality and unique deck of cards.\nWhat's in the box?\nEach deck contains the following:\n56 total cards - The 'standard' 52 poker cards, 2 Jokers, 2 Gaff Cards.\nGaff/Trick Cards:\nGaff #1 - Double Backer  -  A card with the back art printed on both sides.\nGaff #2 - YOU get to pick! (See Update #8)\nThe tuck box itself will have a reveal in the barcode and so will one of the Jokers.\nProduct Quality and Delivery\nThe finished product will be made to the EXACT production specs and feel of any standard Bicycle deck you would find at a local retail store. I will be printing on heavy Bicycle stock and using the latest 'Magic Finish' coat. These are not flimsy, cheap knock off brand cards that clump. They come straight from USPCC's (Bicycle, Bee, Hoyle) factory.  Designed in Photoshop and Illustrator the Quicksilver deck is made with the highest level of detail.  The basic run will be 2,500 decks with more printed as needed.\nThis is my third Kickstarter card project (thank you!) and I have some great experience in packaging and delivery.  My last project (Americana) had 99% of rewards in the mail within 1 week of getting them from Bicycle.  We have all heard of nightmares with blown delivery dates or shipping nightmares... I have been doing this for over a year now and I have a great system down for shipping. Most rewards are shipped out Priority Mail to ensure a safe and fast delivery.  I use the same materials NASA uses to get the astronauts to the moon: cardboard, bubble-wrap, foam peanuts and tape!\nUncut Sheets\nHave you ever seen an entire sheet of dollar bills or baseball cards? This is the same thing!  The only way to get an uncut sheet is to pull it off the press before it gets to the cutting and sorting machine.  These are not cheap posters printed at a copy shop.  They are the real deal measuring in at 22\"x29\". I am going to have the line-manager pull off 100 uncut sheets for you guys here on Kickstarter.  This is definitely a unique item for card collectors!\n(The ?'s will be announced soon, stay tuned!)\nStretch Goals\nOverfunding is common on Kickstarter, as a reward (to you!) for this I have come up with some long-term goals!\nCOMPLETED - 100% - The deck is funded.\nCOMPLETED - 125% - The tuck box will have a special Kickstarter tuck seal.\nCOMPLETED - 150% - The tuck will be adorned with silver foil instead of ink.\nCOMPLETED - 175% - The tuck box will also have embossing.\nCOMPLETED - 200% - All of the above and the decks pledged on Kickstarter will be the only way to get one with with foil and embossing.  Any decks sold afterwards will be in a standard tuck box with no seal.\nCOMPLETED - 250% - Custom Brick Boxes (holds 12 decks) and all of the above. (Any reward with over 12 decks will come with the custom box!)\nCOMPLETED - 300% - Dice unlocked!\nCOMPLETED - 500% - Will make us the top card deck on Kickstarter and I will preview the final design in the series in a future update!\nNEW REWARD! 'AIP BOTTLES'\nI'm proud to announce that Jamie D. Grant (Send Wonder) is going to produce FIVE 'Anything Is Possible' bottles for this Kickstarter project! An 'AIP' bottle is a completely unaltered Avalon Dairy glass milk bottle and inside is a deck of Quicksilver playing cards that are still sealed in it's original cellophane! Whenever times get though, look at your magical bottle and remind yourself that... Anything is Possible.\nNEW REWARD! 'MAGNUM OPUS' BOX\nI have customized a special box that holds 12 decks and 48 dice.  The box will include 4 Brimstone decks (sold out everywhere), 8 Quicksilver decks, 16 Brimstone dice and 32 Quicksilver dice.  As you can see, this will be the perfect box to hold all three designs once I release the last deck in the series next year.  Kickstarter will not allow me to offer a coupon for a future deck, but don't be surprised if it comes with a little slip of paper with words on it.  I am only going to  have one of these available.\nHow Your Contribution Pledges are Utilized\nProfits from the Brimstone and Americana decks have been used to start the Circle City Card Company.  I opened a website last fall (www.circlecitycards.com) and have put the rest back into help fund my latest deck, Quicksilver.  Money raised will be used to produce a limited run of decks commissioned by USPCC. Each deck will have 56 cards, matching custom tuck-box and be wrapped in cellophane. Your help is needed to get this (and future) custom card decks out there!\nDon't forget to spread the word, that's the only way we can make this project succeed.

Sometimes you just have a long night, and you wake up  hoping no one see's you before you have a shower and a cup of coffee. In your eyes, you look like a mess.\nI'm pretty sure you're wrong.\nAbout This Here Project: A little while ago I did a photo shoot with Tayler (pictured in the project photo), and she'd just woken up, didn't feel like changing. And it was amazing! I love that wild hair girls have when they wake up. That right there can make a relationship: opening your eyes in the morning to see this beautiful creature rising with the sun, comfortable as can be in one of your old shirts.\n\"First Thing in the Morning\" is a magazine made to reinforce that. This isn't a glamour magazine, nobody is going to spend hours (or even minutes) putting on makeup; this 25 page magazine will feature three girls having their picture taken with 35mm film and The Impossible Project's instant film shortly after they wake up. There is a lot of emphasis in the world on how girls look, and how they can look better by covering up how they naturally are. Well, we're going to stick to what's real.\nAmanda- 8.28.12, no make up\nWhat You Get For Being A Backer:\nIt doesn't take much to be a part of this project. For $1 you can get a PDF download of the magazine, but if you feel like holding something tangible in your hands and want to really be influential in making this happen you can get a physical copy of the magazine, or one of two Polaroids taken for the magazine. (All tiers for backers listed to the right)\nAlso, this isn't 20 pages of photos/words and then a 5 pages of ads. There are no ads.

I've created one magazine and three books via Kickstarter so I'm pretty familiar with the challenges, and there aren't any risks. \n\nChallenges: \n\n1. Time: Since I'm using a different company to have the magazines printed, I don't have the auto template that I've used on previous books and magazines that I've created through blurb.com. This means that with the help of a couple of friends I have to create the magazine using Microsoft Publisher, which will be a learning experience. I hope to have the magazine finished and shipped by the end of October, but if this proves to be a little harder than I expected the latest it will be finished is November. \n\n2. Shipping: This sort of fits in the \"Time\" category, but the time it takes for the printers to ship the magazine to me determines how quickly they get to you. Also, international shipping time varies so as soon as I get magazines/postcards in, they will be going out to you as quickly as possible.\n\nThat's about it as far as challenges go: time is the enemy.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #16", "update_userinfo": "New project: 8 magazine", "update_content": "Hi everyone! \n It's been a while since this project ended successfully, and I just wanted to update everyone that's interested on what's new.

Our concept is as simple as it is beautiful: one issue, one artist, one conversation \u2013 no more, no less. In the past seven years, we have worked with some amazing personalities, such as Tilda Swinton, Ryan McGinley, Ai Weiwei, The Wu-Tang Clan, Miranda July and many, many more. Please read our bio to find out more about us, because what we really want to talk about is Robert Montgomery.\nCHANCE ENCOUNTERS IN THE STREETS\nRobert Montgomery is a fine artist based in London, whose work we first discovered a few years ago. Robert writes poems \u2013 but instead of publishing them in books, he sends them out into the public space in the form of large light installations or billboards in between advertising.\nRobert never signs his work \u2013 so when you come across one if his billboards in the streets, you don\u2019t really know where the message came from, but you immediately know who it is addressed to: it is addressed to you \u2013 to all of us. His work is not only breathtakingly beautiful, but it also conveys the sense of a very sincere and personal investment \u2013 it raises fundamental questions about the world we live in, and how we live in it.\nRobert has an amazing way with words. You can instantly relate to his general unease with our modern life \u2013 but his works are also open-ended enough for you to bring in your own emotions and experience. They never preach, but rather want to communicate with you \u2013 to make you stop in your tracks, and to look at things in a different light.\nECHOES OF VOICES IN THE HIGH TOWERS\nAnyway, you get the idea: We fell in love with Robert\u2019s work. So we wanted to know more about him and went looking for a book of his work, only to find out that there weren\u2019t any \u2013 his work hasn\u2019t really been published beyond magazines and blogs so far. And it was at this point that we decided that we should do something about that \u2013 and that with our background of running a magazine, we actually could do something about that. And so we wrote to him.\nAs it turned out, Robert is not only an incredibly nice and genuine person, but he also had a big exhibition planned for Berlin, his largest to date, titled Echoes of Voices in the High Towers. The first part of the exhibition, which consists of two light installations in Tempelhof park and about 20 billboards spread around Berlin, opened in July and is still on view. The second part will open in a former swimming pool in September. Altogether, the exhibition covers all aspects of Robert\u2019s work: light installations, billboards, a fire poem where he literally set fire to one of his works, but also drawings and hijacked pages in various magazines. So it didn\u2019t take us long to agree that we should do a publication on this project.\nTHE THINGS WE COULD DO\nNow, the book will actually come as three books: there will be one booklet to show his previous work up until now. Then there will be one booklet documenting his current project in Berlin in more detail, because it makes for such a great cross-section of the way he works. And then there will be a booklet with two really beautiful interviews with Robert to give you a better understanding of his approach.\nWhat\u2019s special about the publication will be its size: Robert works mostly in large-scale formats \u2013 well, billboard size, really \u2013 so we thought we should do our best to also make the book as large as we possibly could: it will come in A2 size, folding out into A1, all neatly packaged in a screen-printed cardboard envelope. And yes, it\u2019s going to be a beautiful thing...\nOne last thing that is important: since we have been producing our magazine mono.kultur for so long, we not only know how to make a really good and well designed book, but we also have the networks to distribute it. Because it is one thing to make a beautiful book \u2013 and it\u2019s another thing to actually get it out into the world.\nFROM HERE TO ETERNITY\nWe are already well on our way of putting together all the material \u2013 preparing the images, editing the interviews \u2013 because we really want to release this at Robert's exhibition in the former swimming pool in Berlin. So the launch date is set for October 13, which is also the closing weekend of the exhibition. And if you are around, then of course you are invited to join us for the launch party.\nBut \u2013 as the project has grown in size, we realized that the costs for production will be a lot higher than we had hoped: we are looking at around $12,000 altogether, of which we can cover about $7,000. So that\u2019s why we are asking for your help to cover the hole in our budget, so we can make sure that the book will the best it can possibly be. And of course, if we can even exceed our goal, then you will save us from some sleepless nights \u2013 so help us spread the word!\nNeedless to say, all funds go straight into the production of the book. And any profit that we might make eventually from sales, we will put aside for the time when we come across another project that we feel as strongly about as we do with this one \u2013 so we won\u2019t have to ask you again the next time around.\nFind out more about Robert's work: www.robertmontgomery.org\nFind out more about Robert's current exhibition: www.neueberlinerraeume.de\nFind out more about us: www.mono-kultur.com & www.mono-blog.com\nAll images by Robert Montgomery\nSoundtrack Apnee by Kangding Ray\nInstallation Live Footage by Superiest", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #13", "update_userinfo": "ECHOES OF VOICES FINAL UPDATE", "update_content": "Dear Friends,\nFriday is a good day, especially when you can announce the release of your first artist book ever, which is finally and truly: OUT!

After years of hard work, this thing is ready to go!\nBut I can't get it off the ground on my shoestring budget. I need funding to get it printed, distributed, and publicized.\nThis project's minimum goal on Kickstarter is just barely enough to get the recording printed and distributed. It does not include any kind of marketing. If we can beat that minimum goal, that will unlock some additional stretch goals that will allow me to promote the music!\nStretch goal #1: GET THE WORD OUT ($1864) \u2014 SUCCEEDED! I'll run an AdWords campaign, send promotional letters and copies of the CD to conventional and online radio stations, and a buy a 1/6 page print advertisement in The Clarinet. I've never promoted any of my compositions or recordings in this way before. You can make it happen for the first time!\nStretch goal #2: MAKE A MUSIC VIDEO ($3464). A music video for avant-garde classical music with no words? Of course! What could be more natural? I'll use my computer programming skills to create an engrossing video for one of the piece's for parts (all abstract, no plot or actors). I'm thinking something along the lines of this gorgeous video \u2014 but with visuals evolving in a way that's tightly integrated with the musical structures. A cool video on YouTube and Vimeo would not only generate more buzz for the recording, but would be a fine piece of art unto itself!\nStretch goal #3: LOCKED\nThe Music\nYou can hear snippets of it throughout the project's video (above). You can also hear Part 1 over at In the Hands, my music blog / podcast. Here's my attempt at describing the whole piece, from the score's performance notes:\n\u201cEntanglement, soliloquy, tango, flight: each movement poses a problem from which the next unfolds. Themes continually resurface, transformed, as the music reinvents its own past \u2014 the endless process Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez described as \u2018piecing together the broken mirror of memory from so many scattered shards.\u2019 The coda gathers everything together, grappling, burning  down \u2014 and then, from the embers, a simple benediction emerges, present all along, now laid bare. We discover in retrospect that the music\u2019s destination has always been its source.\u201d\nOthers have said very kind things about it:\n\u201cThe music itself is at once poignant and parodic, touching the soul, yet coyly elusive. Each movement is highly expressive, even romanic, replete with rhapsodic sweeping gestures; the harmonic language teases tradition, while maintaining a disembodied distance from readily recognization tonic-dominant relationships. \u2026 [a] profound and deeply moving work.\u201d \u2014Eric Mandat in The Clarinet, Vol. 39 No. 3\n\u201cPaul Cantrell\u2019s \u2018Broken Mirror of Memory\u2019 is that elusive creature that all performers are looking for \u2014 a piece of new music that is creative and fresh while being consummately idiomatic for the bass clarinet. It\u2019s a fantastic addition to the growing repertoire for the instrument.\u201d \u2014Gregory Oakes\n\u201cThe structure and the themes are ingeniously presented. As a listener you really have to go deep into the piece to catch all actions.\u201d \u2014Stephan Vermeersch\nThe Long Saga\nI first wrote the piece in 2000-2003, for piano and cello. Several wonderful cellists read and even performed the piece (or parts thereof). Parts of it worked great, but a lot of it just never seemed to get off the ground. Although the cellists were great, the music didn't seem to be. I put the piece on ice.\nFast forward to late 2008, when Pat was our guest at the upcoming Keys Please. I'd heard him play a bass clarinet solo that totally blew my mind at a Carei Thomas concert years before, and had wanted to write for him ever since. I gave him the first movement of Broken Mirror just an experiment on bass clarinet, thinking, \u201coh, it probably won\u2019t work.\u201d Wow, was I wrong about that! From the first time we rehearsed together, I knew I'd found the missing ingredient to make Broken Mirror take flight.\nI set about re-imagining the piece for bass clarinet \u2014 simply adapting some sections, and completely rewriting others. Having first written for cello broke me out of presumptions about what bass clarinet music is supposed to do; this piece is unusually singing and melodic for new bass clarinet repertoire. However, there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that this is a bass clarinet piece now.\nThe project has always run on a shoestring budget and borrowed time. Recording the piece took the next two years; I spent another year just working on editing and mixing. Then, just when it was about ready for release, I got a call\u2026.\nThe Prize \u2014 and the Urgency\nThe International Clarinet Association awarded this piece first place in their 2012 composition competition. (Woohoo!) That meant the piece was under embargo until its big premiere at the August 2012 \u201cClarinetFest.\u201d That premiere just happened, and was tremendously successful. One listener told me, \u201cpeople were listening so intently as it came to the end, the audience was completely silent. That hardly ever happens.\u201d\nThis project is now on a fast track timeline. There\u2019s now a little bit of buzz around it, people are hungry for the recording, and I want to get it out there quickly!\nThe Rewards\nFirst and foremost, of course, is the recording itself. I can't send you a photo of it yet, of course \u2014 that's what I'm raising money for! Here is the awesome cover art, courtesy of Andrew Bessler's design and Paige Whitney's photography:\nIn addition to the CD itself, you can get a nice little art print of the cover design.\nYou can get the meticulously engraved sheet music for the piece. I put a lot of work into making the score appealing not only to performers, but to anyone who enjoys a beautiful visual and tactile experience.\nBoth the CD and the sheet music come with free shipping in the US when you get them as a Kickstarter reward! You'll be able to order them after the Kickstarter project is done, but you'll have to pay for the shipping.\nJumping from the polished to the completely raw, I'm giving out original draft pages of the score as rewards. That\u2019s \u201coriginal\u201d as in \u201cthis is the sheet of paper on which Paul first wrote down some of the music as he sat at the piano.\u201d\nThere will be a mystery poster! What will it look like? It's a mystery! Probably some mixture of musical notation, a MIDI-editor-style view (similar to the Music Animation Machine), and spectrogram. What are those, you ask? They visualize conversations between the composer and the performer\u2026\n\u2026between the performers and their instruments\u2026\n\u2026and between the instruments and the air:\nNow picture these three visualizations \u2014 thought, action, and sound \u2014 spread across a poster showing not just the 16 seconds above, but the entire piece!\nIf you enjoyed how I walked through parts of the music in the video, you might want to sit down with me at my piano and look at the whole thing together that way. It would be a good time!\nFinally, if you're a Vanderbilt, or just exceptionally awesome, you can get the mega-reward: a small commission for the instrument of your choice.\nCheck the rewards column at the right of the page for donation levels and details.\nAny questions?\nPlease let me know, and I'll do my best to answer them!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #8", "update_userinfo": "Would you like to help me make a promo video?", "update_content": "Things are moving swiftly with the album project.

Check out SmartThings here. ***\nNew Video: Ubi & SmartThings\nUbi - Always on. Always ready to help.\nUbi is a voice-activated computer that plugs into a wall outlet. You talk to the Ubi and it talks back. It directly connects to the Internet through wifi.\n\"Look ma, no hands!\"\nWe believe people want to do things when they're at home - they clean, they fold laundry, they cook, they eat, they spend time with loved ones. These are all things that (for the most part) take up use of our arms and hands. When we're at home, we'd rather use our limbs for other activities than typing, scrolling, or swiping.\nUbi is short for ubiquitous computer because it's always on, always listening, always ready to help. It can scribe, listen, analyze. Ubi will either talk back to you the information you seek or indicate information through multi-color lights. \nUbi listens to its environment and senses it through sound, temperature, light, pressure, and humidity. It can record this information or use it to trigger events and communication.  \nWhat can it do? \nUbi can be used for potentially hundreds of applications. The applications we plan to ship with the Ubi are:\nVoice-enabled Internet search \nSpeakerphone \nIndicator light (light changing based on events, e.g. weather, stock, email) \nHome speaker system with sound piping \nVirtual assistant (audio calendar, feed reader, podcast etc) \nVoice memos \nAlarm clock \nIntercom system \nBaby monitor \nNoise pollution monitor \nControlling the climate of your home perfectly (through web enabled thermostats like Nest)\nA Helping Hand\nWe see a huge potential for Ubi to assist those who have visual, hearing, or mobility impairments. With its indicator lights and talk-to-activate functionality, Ubi is super simple to setup and use. We want the Ubi to make it easier for our parents and loved ones to stay connected with us and the world. \nYour Kickstarter Contribution \nWe're serious about making this technology of our dreams easily available to everyone. Your Kickstarter contribution is going to allow us to get safety approval (FCC and CE) so that it can be used everywhere. It will also help driving down the cost of making the Ubi so that everyone can afford at least one.  In a nutshell, your contribution will:\nAllow us to meet regulatory approval\nGet our first production run in place (tooling, machining, and chip printing - we are working with local firms who are very talented)\nAllow us to complete the initial apps we're going to deliver with the Ubi\nRewards\nEach Ubi reward above the $1 level comes with one Ubi unit that has wifi and a slew of other functionality. It also includes the Ubi web, iPhone and Android app and access to the Ubi portal to monitor and setup the Ubi remotely. You'll also get early access to the API.  \nUbi is available in arctic white or midnight black. Please specify which is your preference when you back the project.\n$1 - Access to backer-only updates and early offers when product is launched    \n$149 - Early backers - 1 Ubi (limited to first 100)\n$189 - Single Ubi \n$349 - Two Ubis \n$479 - Three-pack of Ubis \n$649 - Five-pack of Ubis\nNEW! - $1249 - The Inner Sanctum - The Ubi 10-pack and much more\nHow it works \nUbi plugs into a wall outlet and accesses the Internet through a wifi connection. It has a microphone and speakers and listens for commands. Saying \"Ubi\" wakes up the Ubi for receiving verbal commands. You can then instruct the Ubi to do your bidding. Ubi will receive plain language commands. Ubi communicates back to you through speech or by using lights.\nOnboard the Ubi are sensors to monitor your environment: \n\nTemperature\nHumidity\nAir pressure\nAmbient light\nThis data can be stored online or used to trigger alerts to your mobile device or email. \nThe Ubi runs Android with a powerful processor to perform voice recognition and also has the ability to connect to other devices. You can plug in speakers, USB drives, or connect through Bluetooth directly to your iPhone or Android device. For developers, you can also communicate with potentially thousands of devices (through RF, wifi, or Bluetooth) and we're making the device open so peripherals and other applications can be used with it. \nTechnical Specs on the Ubi \nAndroid 4.1 Jelly Bean \n800 MHz ARM Cortex-A8 Processor\n1 GB RAM \n802.11 b/n/g Wifi Enabled (WEP, WPA, and WPA2 encryption)\nHi fidelity speakers and omni-directional microphone \nUSB 2.0 with 5 V power supply \nBluetooth 4.0 \nTemperature, humidity, and air pressure sensors \nAmbient light sensor \nRF Transceiver Module \nPlugs into a standard NA 110 V, 15A power outlet (world versions to be forth-coming)  UPDATE: NA two-prong plug, but 100-240 VAC, 50-60 Hz support! UPDATE #2: worldwide plug support available!\nDimensions (approximate): 4.0\" x 4.0\" x 1.1\"\nWhere We're At \nWe've been working for over ten months on the concept, design, and prototyping of the Ubi and we're now at a point where we're ready to bring it to the Kickstarter community. We've also built an early working prototype and have been refining the design to make it more compact and easier to use. We've been in contact with manufacturers and suppliers and have spec'ed out the costs for bringing the Ubi to market. Ubi is currently slated to work in English with North American voltages. We hope to expand this to other regions and languages. \nWe're working with local and overseas suppliers for sourcing the Ubi's electronics and plan on completing the machining, assembly, testing and certification of the Ubi in the Toronto area. We've also worked with certification authorities for pricing of safety and communication testing of the Ubi and inspection will be completed at the final point of assembly.\nOur team is experienced in working on dozens of projects for engineering research institutions. All of our team members have engineering backgrounds and have delivered on real engineering projects in the past.\nSample Data from the Ubi \nBelow is an example of some of the data that will be available from the Ubi as it monitors different aspects of its surrounding environment. The Ubi can constantly monitor your home to provide triggers or feedback. \n    Special Thanks and More\nThanks to all of our backers for helping us get this exciting project off the ground! We'd also like to thank the other Kickstarter projects that have inspired us like Twine, t\u014dd and Pebble.   \nA HUGE thanks goes to our extremely talented friend, Joe Sarafian, of RapidParts.ca for his help in creating our Ubi prototype. \nA special thanks also goes out to El Cantador for allowing us to use their music in our Kickstarter video.

Now with 500 watt hours!!\nHelp us bring a Utility In A Box to reality. \nPlaneta Sustentavel calls the Forty2 the future of solar panels: http://t.co/nu7ygdIE (Thanks for the thumbs up, Brazil.)\nSilicon Prairie News with a great story (and by far the best team picture): http://spne.ws/nO\nIdeaMensch interview with our founder: http://ideamensch.com/brian-gramm/\nGigaOM spreading the love: http://gigaom.com/cleantech/now-on-kickstarter-a-solar-utility-in-a-box/\nToms Hardware with an interesting note: http://www.tomshardware.com/news/Kickstarter-Solar-Charger-Power-forty2,16980.html\nGreat conversation with GizMag: http://www.gizmag.com/forty2-personal-portable-solar-battery-energy-device/23737/\nKeetsa talked about the Forty2: http://bit.ly/QbtEJY\nThe critics have said it wouldn't work. That it couldn't be built in the US. That it couldn't generate enough power for a remote home, while still being small enough for children to carry. That ideas this good only come from \"the Valley\". \nIt does work (as you see in the video) - in fact, the solar power works very well. It is going to be Made In The USA. It will power small refrigerators, phones, TV's, and other small appliances, and your 12 year old can carry it around. OK, it didn't come from Silicon Valley, but it did come from the Missouri Valley. \nWhat Does the Forty2 Do?\nThe Forty2 is an all-in-one unit that combines all the elements of a grid into one small package. It combines power generation (solar), power storage (Lithium Ion batteries), power inversion (power cord ready), and efficiency monitory (brains) in one mobile unit. Truly a Utility In A Box. \nUnlike other things you may have seen come to market, this isn't a kit. Or a dressed-up battery with a solar trickle charger attachment. This is true solar power that incorporates storage for when the sun isn't shining. \nIt is powerful enough to run small appliances, light up a small army of LED lights, charge several laptops or a couple dozen cell phones, or power a pretty big TV. We don't have enough space here to list all the ways it can be used - rather, the question is \"How do you think you would use it?\"\nThe Forty2 closed - about 2 ft. by 3 ft. in size.\nThe Project\nWe need your help with a first run of at least 250 units of the Forty2. Suppliers are lined up and the manufacturing ready, we just need help with the budget. Specifically, we are looking for help with the tooling budget (the molds and dies that are used to produce the unit). The supply chain is ready and local - we just need to give them the green light. \nOnce the first run is complete, we will a) send them out to our Kickstarter friends so you can help us make it better; b) get them in the hands of potential customers to give it a try; and c) get ready for mass-production. If you help us hit our goal quickly, we think we might be able to get them to you in time for Christmas this year.\nThe Tech Specs for Forty2\nSolar: ~180-200 watts\nBattery: 350 watt hours Lithium Ion\nBrains: Let's just say they are 'advanced'\nAC Outlets: 3 of them built in to the unit\nKits: None. This is an all-in-one product.\nThings it can run: Dorm fridge, HDTV, fans, a lot of LED lights, laptops, many phones, stereo, etc.\nWhere to use it: In the US, you can use it for tailgating, camping, as back-up power, or anything else where you don't have access to a plug-in. Internationally, as you can see in the video, it becomes a life-changing device. It is simply amazing to think what this can do for people.\nMade: in the USA\nThe 'Ugly Prototype' powering a bright light.\nSome Background Info\nAs you can see in the video, we spent A LOT of time making the design look sleek. We think you will agree that the design elements rival what the guys in Cupertino come up with - only we didn't have their budget to do it. \nSimple. Durable. Portable. Beautiful.\nIt is fun to be at the beginning of something this powerful, and we hope to someday see the Forty2 as common as gas generators are today. Which is impressive for a few guys working on the project after 'day jobs'. This literally started in Brian's basement. \nDaren, Tom, and Brian tinkering with the prototype.\nWe realize that this Kickstarter is not the end goal, but rather an important project along the path of bringing the Forty2 to reality. Peppermint Energy was formed as a company to take concepts like Forty2 and create a path to reach a market. Yes, we are a business. No, we are not a charity. However, we are the rare bird where the business does a great deal of good in the world. We need more businesses like this.\nThe Forty2 open.\nAlso, in case you were wondering - yes, we will make more. If you help us spread the word and this Kickstarter goes nuts, we will be able to make a larger first run to make sure everyone gets their Forty2. The 500th one is easy, it is the first 250 we need help with...\nOther Rewards Photos\nSolar LED keychain. You won't believe how much light these throw off.\nFoldable Solar Charger for your phone. Folds up to be about the size of a tablet.\nThe Solar Backpack charging a Droid. These include a battery pack, so you can charge smartphones and most tablets.

Enjoy your newfound portability!\n\u00b7 Simple yet stylish; makes a great addition to your daily life.\nHow did the Keylet come about?\nWhile jogging one day, the keys in my pocket kept jingling and my other pocket housed a rather bulky wallet; it was uncomfortable and inefficient. In addition, the wallets that are currently being used wear out quickly after several months. We wanted to solve these dilemmas; we wanted to create a wallet that would eliminate clutter, possess a slim profile, and be durable. And, after a multitude of prototypes, we have found the perfect solution:\nThe Keylet\nHowever, after talking with family and friends, another problem presented itself: the number of keys the Keylet could hold. To solve this problem, we came up with:\nThe Key Caddy:\nThis convenient companion to the Keylet provides the perfect complement for those that carry around a multitude of keys.\nThe Design Process:           \nWhen we first set out with the initial design, we wanted it to be the following:\n\u00b7 To be unique\n\u00b7 To be sophisticated\n\u00b7 To be compact and efficient, while allowing easy access to all the important essentials.\n\u00b7 To not be restricted by traditional wallet design.\n\u00b7 To be strong enough to withstand the rigors and beating of an active lifestyle.\n\u00b7 To divert from the status quo and rethink what a wallet should be able to do.\n\u00b7 To be made right here in the U.S.A\nWe spent over a year designing and redesigning the Keylet until we felt it captured the true essence of what we envisioned. When constructing the Keylet, we did it with a passion and a purpose. Why make something that we do not believe in and would not use every day?\nMaterial and Construction:\nIt took a lot of refining and countless hours of research to decide what the best material for our creation would be. We need it to be durable, withstand even the most active and on-the-go lifestyle, but at the same time provide the finest quality and promote simplicity. So, we:\n\u00b7 Used precision construction and machinery for quality\n\u00b7 Used 304 Stainless Steel with a number 4 brushed finished -- by using this alloy for the two outer plates, it provides rigidity and with the number 4 brushed finish, it helps protect against scratches.\n\u00b7 Used a 6061 aluminium core for keeping the overall product lightweight.\n\u00b7 Used counter-sunk holes for a flush design\nThe design of the Keylet was kept simple, and, in doing so, this made it easy to finalize construction.\nCompetition:\n\u00b7 Traditional wallets are bulky and cumbersome\n\u00b7 Most wallets wear out within a few years, if not a few months\n\u00b7 Most money clips made from the same respectable material retail for over $80!\n\u00b7 Many competitors advertise that they will hold everything you need, but this is clearly not the case\n\u00b7 Requires the consumer to pay a premium for more sophisticated wallets\nWhat we need the money for:\n\u00b7 Up to this point, we have used all our cash and nearly maxed out all of our credit cards; we need the money to place manufacturing orders as well as to package the product.\n\u00b7 Upon successful launch of the Keylet and Key Caddy, we will:\nWeek 1:               \nPlace order for manufacturing (process will take approximately 4 weeks)\nWeek 2-4:          \nPlace order for packaging material, keys, bolts\nSend survey for key type and place orders for keys\nWeek 5:               \nKeylet returns from production line and will be laser etched \nInspect each keylet and key caddy for flawless quality\nWeek 6:               \nPackage orders and ready them for shipment\nAbout Us\nWe are two awesome friends from Orange County, CA\n\nWe have known each other since second grade and grew up together like brothers.

It feels like viewers and creatives waking up from a hundred year nightmare to find out they\u2019ve been spooning the whole time.\u201d says Dan Harmon, Executive Producer.\n\nThe company will also be promoting the project at this weekend\u2019s Comic Con conference in San Diego.

Fino (King of the Hill), teamed up with Dan Harmon (NBC\u2019s Community, Monster House, Channel 101) and Dino Stamatopoulos (HBO\u2019s Mr. Show, Conan, Adult Swim\u2019s Moral Orel and Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenhole) to begin work on a stop- motion animated holiday special for NBC\u2019s hit show Community entitled Abed\u2019s Uncontrollable Christmas which garnered an Emmy Award\u00a9 for outstanding Achievement in Character Animation. In late 2010, Rosa Tran joined the team as a Producer.\n\nwww.starburnsindustries.com\n\nMedia Contact:\n###\nRosa Tran, Producer, Starburns Industries r.tran@starburnsindustries.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #64", "update_userinfo": "Backers in the UK, HK, Middle East, Slovenia, Croatia, and Greece.", "update_content": "Great news for our friends across the pond: Anomalisa is now showing in cinemas across the UK and Ireland.

You never really cared about the backers that gave you the privilege to make your film!

Sure it's signed and numbered, but as a work of collectable art, it's ruined. it was packed with no plastic to protect the piece, so there are large smudges of dirt on the white paper. Perhaps I can pay to have it cleaned, but again then I'm paying for your ineptitude! Most damaging is the crease across 1/4 of the piece, which is not fixable. Maybe the work can now be \"restored,\" but I'm thinking a dart board is a better use of the physical representation of your farce. The monkeys you hired to handle this job obviously had no oversite, or any experience packing art, because I've received McDonald's dollar menu burgers packed with better care.

BUT WE'RE NOT DONE!\nWow.\nWe are in complete awe of what just transpired. We knew Caroll's story transcended age, gender, nationality and just about every barrier out there, but to see people rally around this film has been amazing. We're going to make I AM BIG BIRD... and it's all thanks to you.\nWe didn't pick the $100,000 number lightly--as a matter of fact, this film will cost a lot more than that. But we knew that with a minimum $100,000, we could make this film. And now we'll be able to. Thank you.\nSo what next? We know Caroll's story has staying power and it seems like our Kickstarter momentum has just gotten started. Now, we're aiming to break the record number of documentary backers. As we write this, we're at 1426 backers. The record is 6508. It's in our sights. Remember, every pledge--even a dollar--counts towards that goal. We've achieved one milestone--a crucial one--now let's take on the next one.\nWe have 6 days left to reach that hurdle and every pledge past $100,000 means we can make the film that we've envisioned, the film that we've been sharing with you for the last 24 days. Don't stop now, folks. Spread the word. Let's make history together.\nMuch love,\nThe I AM BIG BIRD CREW\nUPDATE 5\nHey folks,\nWell here we are. One week to go. Crunch time. With only 7 days remaining, we are $20,000 from our goal. How are we going to close that gap and surpass our goal with a fury? Why, with your help of course!\nIf you\u2019ve already pledged, awesome. You\u2019re the best. We love you. But we\u2019d also love it if you found it in your heart to do more! You can call a friend and tell them about the film. You can Tweet about it. You can blog about it. Get the story out there!\nAlso, we\u2019ve heard from tons of you that HAVE already pledged that you wanted a t-shirt, which we weren\u2019t offering, or the alternate film poster designed by Caroll himself, which we only offered as part of the $500 package. In our ongoing effort to meet your demands, we\u2019re now offering the official I AM BIG BIRD crew t-shirt for $30 and an unsigned poster designed by Caroll for $60. These are both KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVES. You\u2019ll never get them anywhere else.\nWe know you also wanted the signed 2-disc Blu-Ray special edition, but those packages keep selling out. So, in a last ditch effort to make sure everyone that wants one gets one, we\u2019re now offering a $150 package that has both the signed 2-disc Blu-Ray and the unsigned poster designed by Caroll. It\u2019s a great deal for two Kickstarter Exclusives. This really is the last chance to get the 2-disc Blu-Ray!\nFinally, in an effort to make it more accessible, we\u2019ve SLASHED the cost of tickets to the New York premiere from $5000 to $1100. Again, we\u2019ll never make these available to the public, so if you want to participate in what is sure to be a once-in-a-lifetime event, get your tickets now! Don\u2019t have $1100 but still want a chance to get to the premiere? Head over to YouTube and make a video response telling us what Caroll means to you and you\u2019ll be entered to win two tickets to the premiere\u2014for free!\nIf you haven\u2019t pledged yet, here\u2019s a friendly reminder: you\u2019re running out of time. If we don\u2019t hit our goal, all pledges are forfeited, no one is charged and I AM BIG BIRD won\u2019t get made. And that would mean that all the content we\u2019ve been sharing, like this great clip of Caroll talking about how he met his wife, is going to go back into the Spinney archive, never again to see the light of day. Help us keep bringing this amazing content to the world! Happy pledging!\nMuch love,\nThe I Am Big Bird Crew\nUPDATE 3\nHey everyone!\n\nWe're about to start week 3 of our Kickstarter campaign and things are looking good!  We want you to know we appreciate what you guys have done for us.  We also want you to know that we have heard you!  We know people are really interested in getting the 2-disc Blu-Ray special edition signed by Caroll, but couldn't afford the $350 package it came in.\n\nTo that end, we've made limited quantities (50) of just the 2-disc Blu-Ray available for $99.  This Blu-Ray is going to be chock full of all the archival footage we couldn't get in the film and is a must-have for any Sesame Street or Muppet fan!  We can't stress enough that this is a KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE.  This special edition will never be available anywhere else.  Ever.  Get it?  If you've already pledged, you can simply increase your pledge and opt for this special edition.\n\nFinally, in this week's clip, OK Go, rock band extraordinaire, tell you why they support our Kickstarter campaign!\n\nMuch love,\n\nThe I AM BIG BIRD Crew\nUPDATE 2\nHi everyone!\n\nWe\u2019re going to keep this update short, but we just wanted to thank you. A quarter of the way through our campaign, we\u2019re almost at 37% of our goal\u2014that makes us feel pretty great!\n\nThe response from Caroll's fans has been incredible. This outpouring of support is why we turned to Kickstarter in the first place.  It lets us interact with fans on a whole new level.  With Kickstarter, we're not tied to making the movie that an investor demands of us, rather we are free to make a film that honors Caroll's work and is true to who he is.  In essence, Kickstarter lets us make the movie the fans want to see--and as fans ourselves, that is crucial to us.\n\nYou\u2019ve already done so much by pledging and we can\u2019t thank you enough.  But since you\u2019ve pledged, you obviously want to see this movie get made.  How can you help us do that? Tell your friends and family about the project.   Blog about it.  Tweet about it. Post flyers in the subway about it (not really, that might be illegal).\n\nThis campaign is only going to succeed if people know about I AM BIG BIRD so anything you can do to spread the word about the film is crucial.\n\nAnd we\u2019ll do our part too.   Do you have a blog and want to do a piece on the film?  Contact us and we\u2019ll either do an interview or provide you with content to use there (we\u2019ll also then share that blog and hopefully get you more traffic).  No outlet is too big or too small!  We\u2019ll help however we can!\n\nFinally, to celebrate our one week Kickstarter anniversary, here\u2019s another clip from the film in which Caroll rehearses for a Christmas special with Michael Bubl\u00e9.  We think you'll agree that it\u2019s pretty charming. Enjoy!\n\nMuch love,\n\nThe I AM BIG BIRD Crew\nUPDATE 1\nHi everyone!\n\nWhen we first started this Kickstarter campaign, we thought we might post an update a day; however, since we started releasing photos and videos from Caroll's archive, we have been bombarded by emails from people telling us how Caroll impacted their lives.  Responding to each one personally takes time and is very important to us because your support and kind words mean the world to us.\n\nIt's simply amazing.  Many people have told us that they didn't know who Caroll was.  It's not that they were indifferent.  They, like us, had just always thought of Big Bird and Oscar not as puppets, but as beings. They just existed.  It seems like as people have gotten to know Caroll, even in the brief clips we've released, they've realized that the man behind the Bird is the man that makes the Bird.  In other words, Caroll is a remarkable person who deserves to be recognized for shaping generations of people.\n\nWe've had some early success in this campaign--and it's too early to say whether or not that will continue--and we believe that's all due to who Caroll is.  As we've said to countless people, he's exactly what you'd want the man inside Big Bird to be.  We hope that you take the time to get to know Caroll through the photos and videos we'll be releasing here and on Twitter over the next few weeks.  We also encourage you to visit our production journal to catch up on any photos or videos you might have missed.  We think you'll be glad you did, and we hope it moves you to pledge to help us tell Caroll's story to the world.\n\nFinally, we've updated this page with a wonderful video of Caroll talking about how he met Jim Henson. The video features some touching moments from Jim, which came during the celebration of the 15 year anniversary of Sesame Street, which Jim chose to hold in honor of Caroll.  It's the sort of rare video that Caroll has tucked away in his archive that he's chosen to share with us so the world can get to know him a little bit better.  We hope you enjoy it as much as we have.\n\nThanks for reading, and please keep spreading the word.\n\nMuch Love,\nThe I AM BIG BIRD Crew\nAbout I AM BIG BIRD\nI AM BIG BIRD is a feature-length documentary about Caroll Spinney, who has been Sesame Street\u2019s Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch since 1969\u2026 and at 78 years old, he has no intention of stopping. \nThink you know everything there is to know about Sesame Street?  You don\u2019t.  You might know that Frank Oz turned down an offer to play Big Bird, but you probably don\u2019t know that until a last minute change of heart by NASA, Big Bird was supposed to go to space aboard the Challenger.  Or you may know that Oscar the Grouch got his voice from a cantankerous cabbie, but you\u2019d be surprised to learn that a fire in his trash can almost led to Caroll\u2019s untimely demise. \nCaroll\u2019s stories are the stuff of legend.  He has been a constant presence in our lives for over 40 years, his path weaving through American history like that of Forrest Gump.  His time inside the Bird has taught him about the world and about himself.  I AM BIG BIRD will peel away the instances in his life that inspired his creation of characters that have influenced generations of children. And, as the yellow feathers give way to grey hair, it is the man, not the Muppet, who will steal your heart. \nWhat You'll See\nIn addition to compelling interviews with Caroll and his luminary cronies, I AM BIG BIRD will feature fascinating material from Caroll\u2019s personal archives.  Among the treasures in the Spinney vault, we\u2019ve found\u2026\n\u2026never-before-seen footage capturing unscripted moments of Caroll with giants like Jim Henson, Frank Oz and Jerry Nelson. \n\u2026Caroll\u2019s short films, in which he showcases his skill in animation, a talent which led to a job offer at Disney\u2026 which Caroll turned down.\n\u2026Thousands of snapshots and hundreds of hours of videos that capture his undying love for his wife.\n\u2026Art displaying his hidden passion for illustration.\n\u2026Puppets that were lovingly crafted by Caroll\u2019s mother over 70 years ago and that he still uses today. \nWe\u2019re using these amazing artifacts to create a dynamic portrait of an unknown man whose characters have had unrivaled influence in American pop culture. \nWhy You'll Love It\nYou haven\u2019t outgrown Sesame Street.  Maybe it won\u2019t be the opening strains of the theme song that brings memories rushing in, but at some point during I AM BIG BIRD, a skit, a line or a character will bring you back. I AM BIG BIRD won\u2019t just give you a chance to relive these moments, it will let you see them through Caroll\u2019s eyes.  And when it finally becomes clear that Caroll doesn\u2019t just operate Big Bird and Oscar, he gives him their souls, you\u2019ll realize just how much impact the faceless puppeteer has had on your life. \nYou know his characters. Isn\u2019t it time to get to know Caroll? \nWhy We Need the Dough\nWe made it through pre-production and now we\u2019re facing the two costliest parts of making a film: production and post-production.  The money we are aiming to raise on Kickstarter is targeted for three very specific areas: \n-Production Travel\u2014Caroll has spent his career criss-crossing the globe; in order to truly feel his impact, we\u2019ll need to retrace some of those steps\u2014and that doesn\u2019t come cheap! \n-Rights/Licensing/Clearances\u2014The costs associated with licensing Big Bird, Oscar or Caroll\u2019s appearances on programs outside of Sesame Street can be astronomical.  Unfortunately, many of these sorts of cameos are integral to the film. \n-Production Crew\u2014in order to assure that we give Caroll\u2019s story the treatment it deserves, we need to make sure we have the best people at each position.  We have a solid network of freelancers, but those freelancers need to get paid!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #43", "update_userinfo": "That's All, Folks!", "update_content": "Hi out there in Kickstarter Land!\nHere's hoping you're recovering from Thanksgiving and are fully into your Cyber Monday shopping spree!\nAt this point, you should have either received your Kickstarter rewards from us OR received an email from us saying that we don't have your mailing address on file."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #42", "update_userinfo": "Rewards Update: DVD & Blu-Ray", "update_content": "Hey out there in Kickstarter Land! \nThe moment is here: we are THRILLED to announce that I AM BIG BIRD is going to be released beginning this May.

It's a collection of stories about life, the choices we all make, and the paths we ultimately decide to follow. \nWe examine the factors that motivate and drive our major life choices. And, most importantly, whether or not the path we follow through life - and the habits we form based on that path - are truly connected with who we really are as individuals.\nThis is a movie about the moment people realize the life they're living is not the life that's true to their heart... and, as a result, what they decide to do about it!\nFor more insight, don't miss the trailer featured in the video above!\nWe (a film crew of 5) spent two months traveling the U.S. interviewing dozens and dozens of every day people from different backgrounds about their lives and past choices (over 60+ interviews total).\nTo sum it up simply: the journey of making this film changed our lives forever.\nWe knew we had something special when we started. Yet, we had no idea how powerful the stories of the people we met would be until we completed the filming.\nAnd now it's our responsibility to share these stories and the inspiring message with the world in the most engaging way possible.\nAnd that's where we need you. \n*****\nWE CAN'T DO THIS ALONE -- WE NEED YOUR HELP!\nWe've given our blood, sweat, and tears (not to mention tens of thousands of our own dollars) to organize the whirlwind road trip and capture the first initial chunk of the film.\nHere's the problem: as much time, energy, and money it took to FILM the movie - it costs even more to edit, produce, release, and distribute it!\nYikes!\nFor example, here's just a small slice of where our Kickstarter funds will go:\nEditing and organizing the raw footage.\nShooting additional footage (we need to \"pick up\" some shots).\nStoryboarding and planning.\nColor correction.\nSound mixing.\nLicensing the soundtrack.\nResearching archived footage and commercials.\nLegal fees and release licensing.\nDistribution rights for the film (online and offline).\nOur 3-city premiere screening schedule (before it's public).\nMarketing and promotion (online and offline).\nFilm festival and registration fees and filing.\nBottom line: there are too many moving parts for us to do this all ourselves!\nOur world premiere of the documentary will be in July - at the World Domination Summit (a creative conference) in Portland, Oregon. We're scheduled to release the film online a few weeks later (late July)!\nSeveral of the crew members and our families have moved out to the San Francisco Bay area to push towards finishing production. With the help of this campaign we can team up with Stillmotion, an Emmy-award winning production studio, to help build the story, edit the film, and consult on the post-production schedule.\nIt's an ambitious schedule, but we're an ambitious crew! :) \nWith your help we can make it happen - and get this message out to the world in July!\nOUR GOAL WITH THIS DOCUMENTARY\nWe believe that the stories we captured deserve to be told - and that by sharing them we can inspire thousands and thousands of people to take action and change their lives for the better.\nOur goal is to ignite a movement of people who are tired of settling for mediocrity. We want to eliminate \"getting by,\" \"doing fine,\" \"could be worse,\" and \"can't complain\" from the vocabulary of our modern culture.\nWe want to rally together a like-minded group of people who are fed up with living life through someone else's script - and ready to live life on their OWN terms.\nTogether, with your help, we believe we can challenge people to dig back up their childhood dreams... to tap back into their deepest passions... and to take action to make those values more of a priority in their life moving forward.\nHelp us do it!\nHERE'S HOW THE PROCESS WORKS!\nKickstarter is the world's largest funding platform for creative projects. Every month, tens of thousands of people pledge millions of dollars in money to creative projects in dozens of categories.\nA person who supports a project is called a \"backer.\" The process of giving money to the documentary is called a \"pledge.\"\nIn return for your pledge, we (the creators of the campaign) are able to offer \"rewards,\" depending on the amount you pledge.\nFor example, if you pledge $5 to help back the project - we'll offer you a full-length, HD download of the documentary. You'll get access days before it's made public! :)\nPledge levels vary from just $5 to several hundreds of dollars. And each different level opens up a new, creative reward. (For a full list, check out the right side of the page - or scroll down the page a bit more).\nHOW TO PLEDGE AND BECOME A BACKER!\nYou can become a backer in just three easy steps:\nStep 1: Read through the pledge levels and rewards we're offering in the right sidebar of this page.\nStep 2: Click the large, green \"BACK THIS PROJECT\" button to the right of the trailer video at the top of this page. \nStep 3: Enter your pledge amount - and complete the steps for filling in your information. This process takes just a few seconds!\nThat's it! \nYou've played an important role in sharing this message with the world (and get some pretty sweet rewards too!). \nWe owe you big time!\nSpecial note: Your pledges aren't actually processed by Kickstarter unless the campaign is 100% successful. We meet our goal or we get nothing! Don't worry, with your help we know we can knock this out of the park!\nAMAZING REWARDS (WHAT YOU GET AS A BACKER)\nNote: All levels have FREE INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING. Yes, really. Anywhere in the world - we'll ship it out to you. Super simple. :)\n$5 pledge -- You'll get a full-length, HD download of the movie. It's DRM-free, which simply means you'll be able to transfer and play it from all your devices! (A couple people have called us \"crazy\" for giving away the complete documentary for just $5 - but we're really dedicated to making this story accessible to as many people as possible!)\n$25 pledge -- You'll get the physical DVD of the documentary, along with the digital download. Again, this is the most affordable price point we could offer for creating the full DVD (it includes free shipping anywhere in the world!).\n$50 pledge -- You'll get what we're calling a \"swag pack\" along with the DVD and the download. At the minimum your pack will contain a special kickstarter-only, signed movie poster and unique DVD cover. But we reserve the right to add in  extra miscellaneous goodies! ;)\n$100 pledge -- Starting at this level, we'll put your name in the actual credits of the movie (only if you want us to, of course)! Whoo-hoo! Obviously, you'll still get the swag pack, the DVD (except yours will now be signed!), and the download.\n$250 pledge -- This level gets you two (2) VIP tickets to one of our three scheduled premieres. There are three different options for you - one for the world premiere in Portland, one for the east coast premiere in NYC, and one for the Hollywood premiere in Los Angeles. Each ticket gets you special seating, free food and drink, and time hanging out with the crew before and after the showing. And of course, you'll still get your name in the credits, the swag pack, the DVD, and the downloadable version.\nSpecial note: The world premiere in Portland won't be open to the public. It's only available to people attending the World Domination Summit (a sold out conference) and VIP Kickstarter ticket holders through this campaign. However, the NYC and L.A. premieres will have general admission tickets available at a later date (you just won't get the royal treatment of the VIPs). ;)\n$500 pledge -- You'll receive a special \"home screening\" kit to premiere the movie at you home (or wherever you want actually!). Your kit includes 15 signed DVDs, 15 signed, limited-edition movie posters, and 15 individual download codes for your guests (yep, international shipping included for free!). In addition, Adam (producer) and Grant (director) will do everything possible to call or Skype live into your home premiere to personally thank you and your guests! In the unlikely event we can't call in live - we'll record a custom video for you to play before the movie. :)\n$1000 pledge -- Starting at this level, you'll receive official \"Associate Producer\" credit (yes, even in IMDB) for the film and in the credits. We (Grant and Adam) would also love to share a private meal with you, your family, or your friends. We'll make every attempt to be able to schedule this at a time that's convenient to all parties (travel for you and your guest is not included). You'll also receive four (4) VIP tickets (optional, if you can make it) for one of the three premieres listed above (Portland, NYC, L.A. - travel not included). And, as is typical, we'll still send you the full \"home screening\" kit listed above with multiple DVDs, swag, and downloads for your friends and guests.\n$5000 pledge -- We'll bring the party to you! We'll come to your city or hometown, anywhere in the United States or Canada, to premiere the movie in a local theater (or a creative location). We'll work closely with you to coordinate the best premiere we possibly can (we'll help get the word out - and make it a memorable screening!). You'll also be entitled to everything in the \"Associate Producer\" level above (including the official movie credit). Essentially, you get it ALL, baby!\nTHE BRILLIANT PEOPLE WE MET ALONG THE WAY!\nIn addition to the remarkable individual stories from across the country, we were fortunate to also be able to grab the insight of dozens of experts, academics, bloggers, and authors - including:\nJonathan Fields\nJosh Kaufman\nSam Stratman\nDerek Halpern\nPace Smith\nNick Reese\nJohnny B. Truant\nPam Slim\nMJ DeMarco\nJoshua Becker\nPat Flynn\nMax Spiker\nErica Douglass\nEric Handler\nLewis Howes\nNeal Frankle\nScott Dinsmore\nChris Guillebeau\nJonathan Mead\nMark Silver\nCharlie Gilkey\nJD Roth\nDanielle LaPorte\nKim and Jason Kotecki\nThe perspectives of these experts - on various related topics - was a fantastic compliment to the passionate stories we collected along the way.\nNote: These are just a portion of the people we met along the way. We won't list out all the individual stories we captured - you'll get to see those in the movie itself! ;)\nHOW TO SHARE THIS WITH THE WORLD!\nAs we mentioned in the video message before the trailer, we don't have the help of a hollywood studio or television network with deep pockets. But we have something better -- your word-of-mouth!\nThe best way to help is to share this very page with your family, friends, and coworkers!\nBest ways to share this campaign and our exciting trailer:\nOn Facebook. By far, our best tool for sharing this message is through Facebook. You can simply click the \"Like\" button directly below the video at the top of the screen. Or paste the URL straight onto your page with a message!\nOn Twitter. You can also tweet out the video - once again by click the button under the video or simply sharing our the direct URL for this page.\nA short email. Think about the people in your life that may benefit from this message (or appreciate helping to spread the message). Write a short note to them in an email! We'll owe ya! :)\nOld fashioned word-of-mouth. Unplug the computer and your phone and just talk with people in your lives about it! Few things beat a genuine, face-to-face conversation. :)\nAgain, any way you can help - big or small - is deeply appreciated! The more conversations we can start around this issue... the better!\nGET A HOLD OF US - WE'D LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU!\nContact Adam Baker (producer):\nAdamCBaker@gmail.com (via email)\n@ManVsDebt (on twitter)\nContact Grant Peelle (director):\nGrant@CrankTank.com (via email)\n@grantpeelle (on twitter)\nMore about the project and team:\n\"I'm Fine, Thanks\" Facebook Page (new)\nThe Making of \"I'm Fine, Thanks\" (Part One) Blog Post\nThe Making of \"I'm Fine, Thanks\" (Part Two) Blog Post\nWhen in doubt, reach out to the team. We'd love to chat about any media opportunities, unique circumstances, or hear your feedback.\n******\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\nCan you pledge outside the U.S.?\nAbsolutely. Orders are processed through Amazon, which operates in the far majority of countries. We also include international shipping for free!\nCan I change levels after I pledge?\nYes, you can. If you can't decide between two levels, pledge the smaller one - and up until the end of the campaign you can change it to the higher level (and still get all the rewards)!\nCan I give this as a gift?\nYes, again! Once the campaign is over, we will reach out to confirm shipping addresses, how your name should appear in credit (for $100+ pledges), and other details. You can provide us with the information for the lucky gift getter!\nCan I get more information about larger pledge levels?\nAbsolutely. Email AdamCBaker@gmail.com directly. Adam would love to talk with you and answer any questions you may have.\nWhat happens if we don't reach our goal?\nWe get nothing! You aren't charged and we don't receive any of the funding. Don't worry, this won't happen! It's going to be amazing! :)\nWhat happens if we go over the goal?\nWe make a larger impact on thousands of more people! We get to receive any funds that go over our goal - and will funnel those back into the film to have an even larger premiere schedule and release.\nHow is my pledge processed and charged?\nOnce the campaign is successful, your pledge will be processed by Amazon. It's safe and secure - Amazon is one of the premiere online retailers.\nIs shipping included for rewards?\nAbsolutely! We'll ship your rewards anywhere in the world - 100% free.\n*****\nThanks again for all your support!

AND (\"BUT\") I think two things. If you want to get higher dollar value pledges, you might really offer more opportunity to view some insight into your work, more footage, more about why people should invest in you. At *least* offer that possibility within the pledge description at the $1000 and $5000 level. Don't make people have to come to YOU to ask for it. Tell them \"please contact us if you are considering this pledge, and we would love to give you much more information about who we are\". Also, how about offering a small amount of return on investment if people pledge at the $1000 or $5000 level. Even 0.1% of the profits. Even if there are no profits, your can put that clause in up front---that we don't guarantee any profits. These are my ideas. You may very well have thought these through and come up with reasons for not doing that. I'm just saying what makes me and a lot of people \"tick\" when considering pledging on that level. And I'm writing this in the public comments, because I think maybe it might make other people chime in with their reactions to these ideas. (Yes, I'm fully ready for people to challenge me, and won't be offended if you do). Finally, to the producers, if it really bothers you in any way that I've put this comment here, and you feel it's affecting your approach, let me know, and I will remove it.
