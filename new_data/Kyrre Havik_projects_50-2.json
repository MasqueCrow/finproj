[{"backer": "Kyrre Havik", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Treasures Of The Troll King: a M\u00d6RK BORG Adventure is an RPG sewer-crawl adventure by Chris Bissette, with art by Johan Nohr.\nGalgenbeck is palimpsest. Tumour. A city built on the ruins of itself. Beneath the sewers the bones of the old city fester.\nThe troll-king Niduk was exiled, driven into the depths to rot and die. Now twisted by hatred and rage he oversees the small domain he has carved for himself, in a forgotten chapel to a murdered god.\nWhy are you here? A lost bet? A doomed quest for silver? Boredom?\nDoes it even matter?\nALT: A digital mockup of an A5 paperback zine. The art shows the face of a troll, furry and black with a mouth filled with teeth that interact with the text between them in an unsettling way. Gold chains adorn the troll's horns and it wears a gold crown. The title reads \"Treasures of the Troll King\".\nThe crown will be gold foil. We don't need to say much more about that, do we?\nM\u00d6RK BORG is a blackened artpunk doomsday rpg  about miserable bastards and heretics enduring a bleak, dying world.  It's a doom metal album of a game. A spiked flail to the face. Rules  light, heavy everything else. It's made by Pelle Nilsson of Ockult  \u00d6rtm\u00e4stare Games and Johan Nohr from Stockholm Kartell, and published by  Free League Publishing.\nM\u00d6RK BORG is copyright Ockult \u00d6rtm\u00e4stare Games and Stockholm Kartell.\nTreasures Of The Troll King is an independent production by Loot The Room and is not affiliated with Ockult \u00d6rtm\u00e4stare Games or Stockholm Kartell. It is published under the M\u00d6RK BORG Third Party License.\nTreasures Of The Troll King is an adventure designed for one- or two-shot play. You'll need the M\u00d6RK BORG core game to play it, unless you want to convert it to another system. I literally can't stop you doing that and have very little interest in trying.\nThe adventure will be published as an A5 saddle-stitched softcover zine. Internal pages are 135gsm silk and the cover is 250gsm silk with matt lamination and gold foil stamping on Niduk's crown. This is the same specification as The Wretched and will look and feel really nice. \nAs well as the cover art, Johan Nohr has also produced internal artwork for Niduk, the Troll King - the main threat in the adventure. If you pledge, you'll probably get to see that in an update at some point.\n\nALT: A digital mock-up of an A5 zine open to a two page spread. The pages are black and spattered with red and yellow ink spots. The first paragraph starts with a large calligraphic letter G, in red.\n\nThe adventure takes place in two phases - a point crawl through the sewers beneath Galgenbeck in search of the sunken chapel that houses Niduk, the Troll King, and a location-based dungeon in the chapel itself.\nDuring the adventure characters might encounter:\nA pile of forgotten wishes at the base of a wishing well\n The Church of Forgotten Things, a sewer shrine to the discarded treasures of everyday life kept by a strange old man who has forgotten daylight\nThe finger collector, a strange denizen of the sewers who trades in digits\nA forgotten god sealed inside the bells of the chapel, begging for release\nYou'll find a host of weird locations, harrowing creatures, and new Occult Treasures to drop into your game.\nThe dungeon portion of the book mimics the layout of Rotblack Sludge, the introductory adventure found in M\u00d6RK BORG, so it's familiar and easy to use at the table.\nThere are no stretch goals or add-ons and just five standard reward tiers to keep things simple. What you see is what you get!\nFinger Collector is for people who just want the PDF. You'll get an Itch download key and my thanks. \u00a38.\nTroll Hunter gets you the print zine with foil-stamped cover and a PDF copy of the adventure. The Kickstarter edition will be the only one with the foil stamping - future print runs won't have it. \u00a315 plus shipping (to be collected later).\nSupplicant To The King gets you the adventure in print and The God Of Many Faces, a trifold pamphlet adventure. I'll have more details about this in an update during the campaign.  You'll also get PDFs of them both. \u00a320 plus shipping (to be collected later).\nTreasure Hoarder gets you print and PDF copies of Treasures Of The Troll King and The God Of Many Faces, plus a double-sided poster with the cover art on one side and the dungeon map on the other. The poster will be printed at A3 and folded down to A5 when it ships. \u00a333 plus shipping (to be collected later). UPDATE: There will now be the option of two posters. You get one as standard in this tier and will be able to choose which design you want, and will be able to add the second poster through the Loot The Room store after the campaign ends if you want both.\nKeeper Of Occult Secrets is the expensive tier for people who want to help out and have money to burn. Identical to the Treasure Hoarder tier, but I'll write additional content by hand in 66 copies of the zine. This could be new occult treasures, additional encounters, more adventure hooks, or something else entirely. Every copy will be unique - I won't repeat content. \u00a366 plus shipping (to be collected later).\n What's that other tier? \nSewer Crawler is a premium tier for people with money to burn who want me to run the adventure for them.\nChris Bissette is a musician and ENnie-nominated game designer from Manchester. Their solo journaling game The Wretched was selected as on of Tabletop Gaming Magazine's 'Best Games of 2020' and has spawned hundreds of games using it's Wretched & Alone engine. Freelance work includes The Gauntlet (Brindlewood Bay), Hunters Entertainment (Gods of Metal: Ragnarock), and more. Find them on Twitter @pangalactic.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll the text is written and layout is complete on the main zine - barring any playtest feedback - and Johan has provided me with both pieces of art. I still need to do layout for The God Of Many Faces once it's back from editing, but it's small and that won't take long at all.\nThis will be my 4th Kickstarter. I'm used to running them and fulfilling them. I also run a webstore and a Patreon that I release regular print games through. I work with my printers regularly and my fulfilment process is well-practiced.\nObviously there is still a global pandemic happening, so printing and shipping might be delayed, I might fall ill - anything could happen, really. The risk is minimal, though, and if you've backed my campaigns before you'll know I write regular updates and try to be as transparent as possible if delays occur.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSustainable materials\nMixam prints on recycled paper using recycled inks\nSustainable Distribution\nI deliver all my packages to the post office by hand, on foot.

Salvage and steal to survive and endure a ruthless universe. And above all, do anything you can to get that next job.\nThis sci-fi tabletop roleplaying game takes you to the grimy blue-collar future of a universe filled with risk, but also opportunity. DEATH IN SPACE presents a vision of space where technology is broken and dirty, and society is harsh and desperate. The player characters make up a crew with their own spacecraft or station, and take on the jobs they can find, in order to earn some well-needed bucks and get ahead in the power struggles of the stellar system. \nThe people making this game are Christian Plogfors and Carl Niblaeus of Stockholm Kartell. With this Kickstarter, we hope to get the funds to print the core book for the game, which should contain everything you need to start playing. We want to continue making material for the game after the game is out, in the form of adventures and other material to use in your game. \nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter or on the website. \n\nHere's a preview of what we hope the standard edition of the book will look like (the holographic foil is stretchgoal-dependent):\nDEATH IN SPACE has its roots in the OSR scene, and follows similar design principles. In terms of setting and tone, inspiration comes primarily from the gritty science fiction of films like Outland and Prospect, classic westerns and the grimy future of early 80\u2019s science fiction movies. \nIt is a game about adventure and uncertain journeys out into the darkness of space, it is about you and your crew making a home of your spacecraft or station, in tough competition with everyone else, and most of all, it is about enduring in an abandoned frontier system where your only hope of surviving is to take any contract you can find, sometimes having to put your fate in your enemies' hands.\nInspiration\nThere are a lot of great and inspiring games out there. In terms of rules and approach, we have found inspiration in some form, large or small, in for example the following games (alphabetically listed): Coriolis, Into the Odd, Knave, Mothership, Mutant Year Zero, M\u00d6RK BORG, Offworlders, Solar Blades & Cosmic Spells, Mutant  (1989 edition), Traveller. Out of these, M\u00d6RK BORG, Knave and Coriolis deserve a special mention.\nMost of the inspiration for the tone and feel comes from movies and series. Some of these, that have inspired elements of the setting in one way or another, are (alphabetically listed): 2001: A Space Odyssey, A Fistful of Dollars, Alien, Blade Runner, Escape from New York, The Expanse, Firefly, IO, Moon, Outland, Prospect, Sunshine, Total Recall, The Warriors. \nVisually, much of the inspiration comes from abstract geometric art and design, and old computer interfaces and manuals.\n\nIn terms of music, one of our stretchgoals consists of a dedicated soundtrack for the game, by our musician collaborator Helium Kid Kanon. You can already listen to a preview of what that will sound like on Spotify (or scroll down to the stretchgoal list and listen immediately). \n\n\nStandard edition with holographic foil (not final)\nKickstarter exclusive edition (not final)\nOur main goal is to print a durable book of excellent quality that is easy to use at the table. We aim for an offset printed book with a sewn binding and possibly some fancy extras, depending on which stretchgoals are funded.\nThe book should land at about 128 pages and measure 6 by 9 inches. You can choose from two cover versions: the standard cover, and a special edition, only available in the Kickstarter.\nRegarding the covers, we plan for the special edition to be a cloth bound book, and the regular edition cover to be embellished with holographic foil (the silvery kind with reflecting colors), if we fund the corresponding stretchgoal (otherwise, the holographic parts will be a solid color). Apart from that, there are more possible upgrades to the book in stretchgoals. Basically, we don\u2019t want to pull any punches, and will try to make this as nice a book as possible.\nContentwise, the core rulebook contains everything you need to start playing immediately:\n Light-weight rules, intended to be easy to use and quick to learn\n  A system for quickly generating player characters and their spacecraft or space-station\n   60+ different modules to make the spacecraft or space-station your own\n  An introduction to the default setting, the Tenebris stellar system, its main locations and history (with many pieces of the puzzle left for you to fill in)\n  A system for repairs, where you collect spare parts to repair your stuff\n   20 cosmic mutations, representing physical manifestations of the void through your body\n  A system for spacecraft confrontations and boarding\n  An introductory scenario to jumpstart your campaign\n   40+ tables and generators packed with setting flavor\nBelow are some preliminary spreads to give you a flavor of how the interior of the book will look like:\nThe rules of DEATH IN SPACE are intended to be easy to use and hack but also to support and introduce the setting through the rules. While inspired by OSR games, the primary intent is not to be fully compatible with the rulesets and modules of old, but rather to try to capture the quickness and simplicity of these rulesets, tweak them according to our preferences and add some setting flavor (however, the rules are still close enough to other OSR rulesets that material should be possible to use with some simple conversions).\nThe basic rule when you try to accomplish something, say force open an airlock, or resist the effects of strange radiation, is to roll a d20 modified by one of four ability values, the ability determined by the nature of the task. If you roll over a fixed difficulty, you succeed. Failing checks gives you void points that you can use to increase your chances the next time you attempt something. Beware of saving up too many though, that might result in some nasty consequences. Void points are also used to activate cosmic mutations, strange powers from the void. \nThe player characters are all part of a crew with their own spacecraft or space-station, their sanctuary in a dangerous universe. Characters are generated in a quick randomized fashion, making it quick to make a new one when (not if)  your character suffers an accident. With a list of 60+ modules that provide new possibilities, the players can successively customize their ship or station and really make it their home and base of their adventures. If your ship or gear should break, you can repair it as soon as you collect the necessary spare parts. In case you encounter rivals on your travels, the rules for spacecraft confrontations determine the outcome and whether you can avoid being boarded.\nDEATH IN SPACE focuses on the Tenebris system\u2014a system of planets and objects revolving around the star Tenebris. It is a stellar system ravaged by war and strife, where a greed-fueled mining for precious gems ended in a conflict that laid waste to the intricate trade networks that ensured technological production. With no new parts to find, almost every single object built today, from weapon to spacecraft, is put together from discarded, salvaged or stolen parts. Nothing is new.\nAs if rebuilding the system after the war was not enough, there are reports from stargazing cosmologists that the universe has stopped expanding, and that it has instead begun collapsing at an accelerating rate. The news that civilization is at its end have created a sense of hopelessness and disorder, and in many sectors of the system former vassals have taken this chance to seize control from distant rulers.\nPlayer spacecraft concept by Mattias Astenvald\nIn the heart of the Tenebris system is the Iron Ring\u2014a huge, ring-like structure surrounding the moon Inauro like a belt of metal. This is the center of activity in the Tenebris system, and here miners and salvagers huddle in cramped living quarters, waiting for their next contract and a chance to earn some much needed money. In other parts of the Ring, far from the bustling market-places and common areas, there are dark, empty sectors, where shady types hide from attention.\nAmong the people of the Iron Ring, cryptic rumors are spreading about a void accelerating the collapse. A void that whispers strange sentences to the unlucky through the ever present thick static noise that grows stronger and stronger as you travel towards the edge of civilization. A void that infects and corrupts and imbues their bodies with odd powers.\nIn the middle of all this are the player characters: hard-working explorers and laborers hoping for a big score.\nThe 99% Void Safe reward level\nVoid protection. With this reward level you get the core book in print, with the cover of your choice (regular or special edition). The book will be wrapped in foil, to keep it safe from the strange void radiation. Better safe than sorry. \nThis is a mockup and not the final product.\nT-shirt. Premium cotton t-shirt from Spreadshirt. We're aiming for a design based on the book cover.\nHandouts. Two maps for the adventure in the core book\u2014Welcome to the Ring\u2014printed on high quality paper. \nStickers. One prismatic sticker portraying the spacecraft by Mattias Astenvald, and one holographic sticker using the graphics from the standard cover. These designs are exclusive for the Kickstarter. Below are preliminary designs.\nSetting location and printed note. We create a location connected to the Iron Ring\u2014an establishment, a station, spacecraft or similar\u2014and dedicate it to you. The locations are planned to be included in a table in the book. You get an individually crafted and printed thank-you letter that also includes the location name and description. \n50000 SEK \u2013 We make this book \nA high-quality offset printed 128-page book including all you need to start playing.\n75000 SEK \u2013 Holographic foil cover\nWe add holographic foil to the regular book cover and make this book glimmer.\n100000 SEK \u2013 Soundtrack\nWe ask our musician collaborator Helium Kid Kanon to make a full-length soundtrack for DEATH IN SPACE, that you can use as background music for your games. Every backer gets the soundtrack digitally, and it will also be made available on Spotify and Bandcamp. Here is how Helium Kid Kanon describes the soundscape for DEATH IN SPACE:\n\"Sound waves from dark, vibrating aegrine were found on a 570 million year old, volcanic island. When passed through a cloud chamber, they turn into an oozing, analog warmth, layered with sparkles of cosmic noise. These are some of the parts, arranged into a multi layered space. A composition that can trigger chronesthesia. The soundscape for DEATH IN SPACE.\"\n 150000 SEK \u2013 Pamphlet adventure\nWe make a pamphlet adventure. All backers get it in pdf form and we include it in print with all rewards except Orbit Vagabond and Event Horizon Diver.\n200000 SEK \u2013 More illustrations\nWe add more spacecraft illustrations by artist Mattias Astenvald to the book.\n250000 SEK \u2013 Map poster\nWe make a map poster of the Tenebris system. For the map, we will receive some help from graphic designer and animator Gabriel Herrin. Gabriel did some work on the movie Prospect \u2013 one of the big sources of inspiration for DEATH IN SPACE \u2013 so we are very happy to have him onboard! All backers get it in pdf form and we include it in print with all rewards except Orbit Vagabond and Event Horizon Diver. Note that logos are placeholders and will be replaced.\n300000 SEK \u2013 Bookmark ribbon \nWe add a bookmark ribbon to the book, to make it easier to find the page you\u2019re always flipping to.   \n350000 SEK \u2013 More illustrations\nWe add even more spacecraft illustrations by our artist Mattias Astenvald to the book.\n500000 SEK \u2013 New adventure\nWe ask Rickard Antroia to write an adventure for us. The adventure will be released in pdf and all backers get it digitally. Rickard is a writer and designer who has written adventures for Coriolis and Tales from the Loop and worked with editing on Tales from the Loop, Things from the Flood, Vaesen and Alien RPG. He wants to take you on an epic journey to the edge of the universe.\n700000 SEK \u2013 Cults and factions\nPelle Nilsson - from Ockult \u00d6rtm\u00e4stare Games, author of games such as M\u00d6RK BORG and Barkh\u00e4xan among others, contributes to the game by providing a number of cults or factions of the Tenebris system that you can use in your game.\n\n800000 SEK \u2013 Online generator \nWe ask Karl Druid to make an online character generator for us. Karl writes material and makes virtual paraphernalia for tabletop RPGs. He is for example behind the M\u00d6RK BORG online generators scvmbirther and dngngen.  \n\n900000 SEK \u2013 Printed pamphlet #2 \nWe print the adventure pamphlet by Rickard Antroia from the 500k stretch goal. All backers with physical reward levels get it (all reward levels except Orbit Vagabond and Event Horizon Diver). This means that if you get the printed book, you get two different printed adventure pamphlets with it.\n\n1,100,000 SEK \u2013 Solar Fields song and Tenebris system soundscape\nMagnus Birgersson, also known under the name Solar Fields, will write and produce a track inspired by the material included in the book! Solar Fields has released 17 albums and appeared in over 60 compilations, including the in-game scores for the computer games Mirror's Edge and Mirror's Edge Catalyst. You can find his music on Spotify and on other platforms.   \nIn addition, if we pass this stretchgoal, Helium Kid Kanon will create a number of immersive soundscapes that represent various locations and environments in the Tenebris system. A perfect background to amplify your experience while exploring our world.  \nThe songs for the soundtrack and the soundscapes will be published on streaming platforms like Spotify, and backers get them digitally.\nThe majority of the money we collect will fund the printing cost for the book and any other funded print material. The remaining funds will be used to pay our collaborators for their work and costs. \nDEATH IN SPACE will be published by Free League Workshop, Free League Publishing's sublabel for externally designed games. They are responsible for shipping and distribution.\nWe plan to use a pledge manager, and charge shipping separately after the campaign has ended. See the map for our current best estimates of shipping costs*. The current plan is to ship the game from the UK as the default, but with distribution hubs in the EU and US as well. \n* This is based on shipping one book, the map and a pamphlet, and the Moon Outlaw and 99% Void Safe reward levels may therefore incur some extra shipping charges\n\nChristian Plogfors. When he is not writing for DEATH IN SPACE, Christian spends the rest of his time on the layout and graphics for the game. He has been designing worlds for computer games for 18 years, now as a senior level designer, and has contributed to games such as Battlefield, Mirror\u2019s Edge and Star Wars Battlefront. When relaxing, he likes to write material for his Into the Odd hack Into the Jungle. He has also contributed with material and layout for the Night Yeast zine.\nCarl Niblaeus. While almost every sentence of the game has been dissected by both Carl and Christian, Carl has had the last word on much of the language in the book. In the RPG world, Carl has contributed to M\u00d6RK BORG zine Feretory, the Night Yeast zine, and released one or two old school modules before that. He also helps running the so-called Old School Corner (\u201cOld School-h\u00f6rnan\u201d) at GothCon, Sweden\u2019s largest RPG con. There he referees his own and others\u2019 creations. Outside of RPGs, Carl has a PhD in astroparticle physics, and has spent many years researching the underpinnings of our own universe. In DEATH IN SPACE, this knowledge is used to inspire the creation of another.\nCollaborators\nApart from us there are a number of collaborators who provide invaluable assistance in making the game.\nJohan Nohr. As one half of the team behind M\u00d6RK BORG, Johan should be well-known to many in our audience. With M\u00d6RK BORG, he works tirelessly to make it look as great as it does, and we are very happy to have him onboard. In DEATH IN SPACE, Johan has worked with the illustrations, adding touches to give them a more personal feel.\nMattias Astenvald. Mattias is an artist located in Uppsala, Sweden, working in the digital gaming industry. For our game, he helps make reality of our spacecraft and we hope to make use of his great skills as much as we can. \nGabriel Herrin. Seattle-based graphic designer and animator. Gabriel did some work on the movie Prospect, which is one of the big sources of inspiration for DEATH IN SPACE, so we're really happy have him onboard. He will help us make company logos for the map poster. Check out more of his stuff here.\nStockholm Kartell is a creative coven of writers, designers and idiots.

The game content is at the launch of the campaign about 90% complete, and we foresee no major changes after the campaign. After the campaign we want to spend about 2 months finalising the last few details before doing a proper round of editing and proofreading with a native English speaker. Our plan is then to deliver the game to the printer in September, which should provide enough time for the game to be in your hands by January 2022. \n\nGiven the experience of Free League Publishing, we feel confident that printing, stocking and shipping will be in safe hands, and we will do our utmost to make sure that you will have your books by January!

Indeed, you have come to the right place, but heed this warning: Venture not into these perilous realms of fantastic sword and sorcery, lest ye be of stout mind and steely nerve. For within these pages lie the gates to a wicked world of magic, mystery, devilry, and danger! \nFoul monsters and gleaming treasures await the courageous or foolhardy. Many will perish, but some cunning and lucky souls will rise to greatness. What adventure will you pursue? What terror will you face? What treasure will you uncover? Let us proceed to find out!\nSo, what are you waiting for? Be brave and stay sharp. Triumph is within your grasp, but it\u2019s not safe to go alone. Gather your party and go forth to gold and glory!\nTHE TIME IS NOW.\nYOUR ADVENTURE BEGINS HERE.\nREALMS OF PERIL is a classic fantasy role-playing game presented as a pair of jam-packed zines lavishly illustrated by the amazing DC Stow.\n\ud83d\udcd7 THE ADVENTURER'S FIELD GUIDE is a complete rulebook containing everything you need as a player to learn how to play, create unique adventurers, and advance your characters into powerful movers and shakers in the world. 70+ pages, spot color, soft-touch, staple-bound zine.\n\ud83d\udcd8 THE GAME MASTER'S HANDBOOK is an indispensable reference manual for new and seasoned GMs full of clear and concise procedures, enlightening tips,  best-practices, and inspiring content to help every session come alive. 70+ pages, spot color, soft-touch, staple-bound zine.\nDigital Mock-Up of the Zines\n\u2620\ufe0f Simple but powerful d20-based core mechanic that encourage fiction-focused gameplay. Based on World of Dungeons by John Harper (creator of Blades in the Dark). Dice rolls determine not just success and failure, but whether you encounter cost, choice, or danger in your actions. Most dice rolls are player-facing.\n\u2620\ufe0f Created from the ground up for open-persistent gameplay (aka West Marches). Based on the formative West Marches posts by Ben Robbins (creator of Microscope and Follow). Also inspired by the excellent Hack Attack videos with Steven Lumpkin and Adam Koebel, as well as Matt Colville's West Marches video.\n\u2620\ufe0f Designed with OSR principles in mind, as prescribed by old-school luminaries such as Matt Finch, Ben Milton, Steven Lumpkin, David Perry, Patrick Stuart, Scrap Princess, and Chris McDowall.\n\u2620\ufe0f Mechanics are designed to compliment West Marches style campaigns. Focuses on exploration of a sandbox-style hexcrawl map, an \"open table\" (no set cast of characters or static group of players) and a shared, persistent gameworld (the actions of one set of adventurers leave their mark for future adventurers to see). Features \"flattened math\" so fledglings and veterans can adventure together. Also provided are advice and tools for the GM to host their own open-persistent campaigns.\n\u2620\ufe0f Gameplay is about exploration, interaction, tough choices, and survival more than slaying every monster or angling for an epic story every session. The story is created when we look back at what happened during a session.  \n\u2620\ufe0f Minimal player-facing mechanics and simple character stats encourage creative problem solving over finding the solution on the character sheet. Spend more time talking about the fictional details than looking up complex rules.\n\u2620\ufe0f Fast and evocative character creation driven by a list of 100 classic character backgrounds that provide interesting starting items and flavorful, bite-sized chunks of character background. \n\u2620\ufe0f Adventurers start as level 0 fledglings. Characters are simple to begin with and grow in complexity as they advance, creating a built-in learning curve for players. Easy to learn and teach, but deep enough to provide long-term engagement for players, suitable for full-length campaigns.  \n\u2620\ufe0f Over a dozen compact but flavorful classes, all illustrated with iconic art. Each time you level up, assign a rank to one of the classes and gain a special feature from their list. Multiclassing is expected and encouraged. Combine classes to build the character you want to play. But remember, the real power can only be found out there, in the wild.\n\u2620\ufe0f Several unique types of magic-users, each with their own thematic spells and strange abilities. Spells are about interesting utility more so than pure firepower.  A list of common spells is available to the players, while another set of mysterious and powerful \"treasure spells\" can be found in the GM's Handbook, only obtainable through discovery. More than 100 different spells in total. \n\u2620\ufe0f Hirelings, pets, followers, strongholds, establishments, downtime activities, and more. Ample peripheral content to bolster the party ranks and create extended options for play.\n\u2620\ufe0f Guidelines for GMing that foster creative, interactive, old-school gameplay. Clear systems and procedures for the GM to run a session. \n\u2620\ufe0f Gameplay puts a focus on detailed descriptions of fictional events and \"rulings over rules\". The GM can use the core mechanic to resolve any roll, or they can fall back on a useful list of \"methods\" (PbtA-style moves) that help resolve specific types of actions when needed.\n\u2620\ufe0f Assemble actionable quest goals for players from comprehensive lists of options, provided by Johnstone Metzger. Use the lists to build interesting objectives for adventurers looking to pursue more complex goals or projects.\n\u2620\ufe0f 100+ classic and new magic items that focus on creative utility over bonuses and combat power. \n\u2620\ufe0f Plenty of classic and new monsters, beasts, and enemies to fight or run from. Monsters are scary because they're vicious, deadly, tough, and don't play by the normal rules - not because they have a lot of hit points. \n\u2620\ufe0f Conveniently split into two zines. Why? So the players can be creating characters with the Adventurer's Field Guide on their side of the table, while the GM can reference the Game Master's Handbook behind the screen.\n\u2620\ufe0f Advice for asynchronous and online play.

A haunting revelation awaits travelers who enter the mansion, along with a powerful artifact ripe for the plucking.\nThis zine is designed as a quick adventure that can be easily dropped into an existing campaign. The layout focuses on high accessibility, low preparation, and ease of use at the table.

John (editor) and I go way back, so we're a good team and I guestimate that I'll manage a release around the end of April.\nAfter the PDF release, I'll give it a few days or weeks for everybody to have a look at the finished product before I go full POD mode. From my experience, there are always few very minor errors that survive editing, and maybe someone reports back after discovering something :) So my current best guess for when the POD will be available is around the end of June?

This is a great starting point for you, and if you\u2019re curious about the journey so far you can view our previous campaign here.\nWherever you hail from, step aboard with us now as we launch the series into the farthest reaches of space\u2026\nEscape the Dark Sector\u2122  is a simple, sci-fi adventure game with a focus on atmosphere, storytelling, and player cooperation \u2013 perfect for newcomers to tabletop gaming. It takes about 2 minutes to set up, lasts around 45 minutes, and no two games are ever the same.\nPlaying as the beleaguered crew of an impounded starship, players find themselves confined to the detention block of a vast space station. Using a variety of advanced gear and weaponry, they will embark on a desperate mission to find their ship and blast their way home.\nOver the course of three acts the crew will have to overcome a variety of dangers, from cyborg guards and faulty replicators to killer alien organisms - each of which is represented by a large, beautifully illustrated chapter card.\nAs these immersive chapter cards are revealed one by one, the game takes on the form of a shared storybook experience, with the players making decisions about what to do each chapter before using a combination of dice and item cards to complete the challenges before them.\nThe goal of the game is to complete every chapter in the mission deck, and then defeat the final boss. To win, you must keep each member of the crew alive. If any player is killed the game ends immediately!\nEscape the Dark Sector\u2122 is inspired by classic sci-fi books, films, and TV programmes, including Alien, the original Star Wars trilogy, and Star Trek: The Next Generation to name a few \u2013 and of course, this being part of the Escape the Dark\u2122 series, it also has its roots in the classic adventure experiences of the Fighting Fantasy gamebooks and the Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game. \nEscape the Dark Sector\u2122  has simple rules so it\u2019s easy to learn. You\u2019ll be able to get started within about 5 minutes. Below is a step-by-step overview, or scroll down for a gameplay video. If you\u2019re interested in learning more you can read a very early draft of the rule book here. \nKeen to know what it's like to play Escape the Dark Sector? \nSit back and enjoy this demo game with the team at On Tabletop: \nAt its core, Escape the Dark Sector\u2122 utilities the same narrative game engine as Castle, but adds several new features that make it a different experience altogether: \n A 3-Act Adventure: The chapter cards which make up the mission deck are divided into three acts, each getting progressively more challenging as the mission goes on and each also offering different item drop-rates and a different ratio of encounter types - allowing for a new layer of decision making and strategy. \n Thrilling Ranged Combat: From lowly Slug-pistols to formidable Beam-emitters, a ranged combat system has been designed from the ground up to add thrilling firefights to the adventure. But even with an array of weaponry at your disposal, teamwork remains vital to mission success. \n Tactical Combat Actions: As the game\u2019s intense firefights play out, the highly-trained crew have a wide selection of tactical options at their disposal - including Shoot, Charge, Take Cover, Flank, Ambush, Treat Wounds, and Reload. Forming a robust plan of attack is essential to taking down tough enemies. \n Cybernetic Implants: Each member of the crew is fitted with a interchangeable neural-augmentation chip, giving them a unique enhancement to call upon during the adventure - from pain inhibitors to advanced-reflexes. Players will have the option to switch these out, either to swap with another member of the crew or to replace them with upgrades found along the way  - but doing so incurs an HP penalty! \nYou can find more information about these and other features of the game, in our early draft rulebook here. \nHere's an interview with co-designer Thomas Pike, talking in more detail about some of the game's features: \nSince the game is still in development, the exact contents may vary from that shown here.\n What makes the ESCAPE THE DARK\u2122 series different?\n\u2022 It\u2019s approachable - The game is designed with non-gamers in mind, but is no less rich and rewarding for it. Now anyone can enjoy the atmosphere of a classic sci-fi mission. \n\u2022 It\u2019s quick - It takes less than 5 mins to set up and around 45 mins to play. No downtime, no elimination, and full player engagement throughout. No-one will be bored.\n\u2022 It\u2019s social - Many chapters offer a the group a choice, stimulating regular player interaction and discussion. It's perfect for the pub or a games cafe, but can even be played solo!\n\u2022 It's different every time - You never know what the next chapter will be, so there is plenty of tension and suspense as your unique adventure unfolds each game.\n\u2022 It has a unique look - Many games look alike these days. Here is something truly distinct for your collection. We've worked hard to create a stylish look evocative of retro classics.\n\u2022 There are no heroes - The playable characters are refreshingly ordinary. No musclebound heroes or buxom heroines here, and there is an equal mix of male and female characters.  \n\u2022 You'll be part of something big \u2013 With a wide range of Escape the Dark products already released, a wealth of adventure awaits you. Join our ever-growing community of players! \nWe have organised our pledge levels and add-ons to allow every possible combination of rewards.\nAt each pledge level, on top of the pledge itself, a shipping charge will apply based on your location.

No matter which chapter, item or boss brings about your untimely death, simply flip to the corresponding page for full immersion into the final events of the mission.  \nAll backers will get a free PDF of each of these books delivered to them via Backerkit, and physical copies of the books will be unlocked as an optional add-on. \n UNLOCKED!    \nAt this level of funding, we'll produce a range of T-shirts for Escape the Dark Sector, available to all backers as a optional add-on. \n At this level of funding, we'll produce a companion app for Escape the Dark Sector. Free to download when it launches, and compatible with both iOS and Android devices. \nSimple, elegant and atmospheric, it will be designed to be used on the tabletop alongside the physical game to do things like: \nTrack Crew HP, play the soundtrack, display pages from Death in Deep Space, and offer searchable rules and FAQ. \nThis will be free to all backers if we reach this level of funding, but may not deliver at the same time as the other items in this campaign. \nWe can dream. \nWhile the best way to experience Escape the Dark Sector will always be on the tabletop, we can't deny making a digital version does sound fun. If we raise a million pounds, we'll take the plunge into computer games. \nThis will be free to all backers, but may not deliver at the same time as the other items in this campaign. \nHow does it work? \nTo include add-ons in your pledge, simply increase your pledge amount by the total value of all the add-ons you want. \nAt the end of the campaign you'll be given access to our pledge manager, Backerkit, which allows you to select exactly which items you want to put your pledged amount towards. \nImportant note:\nOrdering add-ons may in some cases increase shipping costs beyond the base level shown on the charts in our Shipping section.

One pack of each is enough to completely sleeve the game.\nTake your game to the next level of desirability with our beautifully illustrated neoprene playmats - transforming your play area into a computer terminal. Each mat serves one member of the crew. \nThere is a lot going on in the mission area during a game of Escape the Dark Sector. Add a bit of 'mission control' to your experience with this evocative playmat.  \nA soundtrack specially composed by Escape the Dark Castle co-designer and illustrator Alex Crispin to perfectly accompany gameplay, housed in a luxurious sleeve. A must for collectors. \nPrepare to immerse yourself even further into the Dark Sector with Mission Log - a collection of short fiction penned by published game-writer and co-designer of Escape the Dark Castle, Thomas Pike. Delve into the background stories of the crew and their ill-fated mission, and learn what little is known about the game's vile adversaries.\nAdd a new narrative dimension to your games with Death in Deep Space, containing a contextual 'death scene' for every chapter card in the game capable of killing you, and of course for the bosses too.\nNo matter which chapter card finishes you off, you'll be able to flip to the corresponding page and read out all the gory details of your demise. What better way to end a game of Escape the Dark Sector?\nIf you choose to pledge for the Join the Crew add-on, our incredible game artist Alex Crispin will hand draw an exclusive crew portrait - of you! \nHow it works: \nPick the crew member you'd like to become, then take a photo of yourself which meets our guidelines (we'll send these out after the campaign).We do the rest. You'll get two copies of the card - one to use and one to keep pristine or frame as a rare collectors item.

So that's how we started our Reroll journey, by doing this as a passion project outside of our daily jobs.\nWe have also engaged an awesome Development team to help us develop the app and also the website (if we hit our stretch goals). The prototype we've seen so far is absolutely amazing.\nWe have been doing this as a passion project with a development team handling the app programming. Kickstarter is a great way for us to validate how much demand there is for an app like this and fund the app development.\nWe also love crafting pixel art. The more we raise, the more likely we'll be able to spend more time doing this, or even be able to do this full-time! :)\nThe app is currently in development, and we have a basic prototype that is about 60-70% complete.

The game is intentionally rules-light, putting the focus of play on imagination, improvisation, and fun. The rules are optimised for ease of use at the table, with meticulous attention to wording and layout clarity. What's more, Old-School Essentials is 100% compatible with the classic Basic/Expert game from 1981, meaning that decades of adventure are at your fingertips!\nOld-School Essentials comes in two forms: a chunky tome and a modular boxed set. The content is identical. Choose one or both, depending on your preferred format!\nThe first two Old-School Essentials supplements \u2014 adding extra classes, spells, and combat options \u2014 will be available as optional add-ons in BackerKit (following the completion of the Kickstarter)!\nDigital mock-ups. Final products may vary. Some new cover art in progress.\nSee below for in-depth info on all products!\nPDFs\nAll books will also be produced as extensively hyperlinked PDFs. Once the Kickstarter has finished, backers will get early access to PDFs in their current, near-finished forms. Once all artwork is in place and everything is finalised, the final PDFs will be sent out to backers.\nFree Basic Rules PDF: To whet your appetite for this game, you can download a free PDF, featuring the basic rules for creating characters, adventuring in dungeons, combat, magic, and spells. Includes the complete rules for four classic fantasy character classes: the cleric, fighter, magic-user, and thief.\nKiller Features of Old-School Essentials\nUsability: Old-School Essentials is meticulously edited and laid out, with the aim of maximising ease of reference during play. No more searching for references scattered across multiple pages. No more scanning dense paragraphs of text to pick out details. Everything in Old-School Essentials is logically organised and collated, and presented in a quick-to-read format based on \"control panels\" \u2014 two-page spreads presenting a single topic in its entirety. (See page examples below or check out the free Basic Rules.)\nModularity: The rules of Old-School Essentials are divided into \"modules\" \u2014 cleanly separated chunks of related content. For example, the core rules of the game are cleanly separated from the rules for the classic fantasy character classes. This makes it simple to swap out any of the modular components of the game's rules with alternatives \u2014 perfect for referees who love to customise and tweak. We have lots of plans for further rules modules in the Old-School Essentials line, building on the core rules to take the game into a myriad of different settings and genres, from science fantasy to post-apocalyptic to sword and sorcery.\nConvenience: All books are produced in handy A5 (Digest) size for convenient use at the table. The small, modular books in the Black Box make it easy to find what you need. Want to look up a spell? Just grab the book of spells. No need to navigate a big tome to find the right section.\nQuality: We're set to produce the Old-School Essentials books at a deluxe level of quality \u2014 hardcovers with sewn bindings. These will be beautiful and seriously durable books!\nCompatibility: Old-School Essentials is a 100% accurate restatement of the original Basic/Expert rules (B/X), with nothing added, changed, or removed. All material written for the B/X rules over the last 38 years can be used with Old-School Essentials, without any conversion effort whatsoever!\nRefinement: The original Basic/Expert game presents a wondrously solid rules set, but the rules are not without areas of confusion and contradiction. All known omissions, contradictions, and areas of confusion have been carefully ironed out in Old-School Essentials.\nBen Milton of Questing Beast\nBen's video review of B/X Essentials (the previous incarnation of Old-School Essentials)\nQuesting Beast Patreon\n\nThilo Graf of Endzeitgeist\nThilo's in-depth reviews of B/X Essentials (the previous incarnation of Old-School Essentials)\nEndzeitgeist Patreon\n\nSave or Die Podcast\nSave or Die review of B/X Essentials (the previous incarnation of Old-School Essentials)\n\nA box full of adventure to fire up your nostalgia to the max! The Old-School Essentials core rules plus four rules modules for creating characters and running adventures in the classic fantasy genre. Each of the five books in the Black Box is described below.\nCore Rules\n72-page A5 hardcover\nThe core rules of the game, including procedures for: creating characters; exploring dungeons, the wilderness, and the high seas; combat, hazards, and challenges; retainers, hirelings, and vehicles; adventure design; magic, monsters, and treasures.\nThe Old-School Essentials core rules are carefully designed to be applicable to a multitude of fantastic campaign settings and genre conventions, from Classic Fantasy to Post-Apocalyptic to Sword and Planet.

(We'll post updates on that design as work on the cover illustration progresses.\n\nThe Rules Tome and the Black Box present a loving restatement of the classic Basic/Expert rules from the 1980s. But this is just the beginning of the Old-School Essentials line \u2014 we have many more books in the works, taking the game into a vista of different worlds and genres.\nAs part of this Kickstarter, we will also be producing a pair of hotly anticipated books to add Advanced magic and character options to your games! These new options are inspired by the beloved Advanced rules from the 1970s, and carefully scaled to mesh smoothly with the lower Basic/Expert levels of power and rules complexity.\nAdvanced Fantasy: Genre Rules\n56-page A5 hardcover\nThis book adds:\n 9 new human classes: acrobat, assassin, barbarian, bard, druid, illusionist, knight, paladin, ranger.\n 6 new demihuman race-classes: drow, duergar, gnome, half-elf, half-orc, svirfneblin.\nOptional rules for choosing race and class separately.\nAdvanced rules for poisons, combat options, and more.\nAdvanced Fantasy: Druid and Illusionist Spells\n40-page A5 hardcover; only required by players with spell-casting characters\n106 new spells that can be used by bards, druids, gnomes, and illusionists, ranging from 1st to 6th level.\nMore Advanced Fantasy Books...\nWe plan to continue expanding Old-School Essentials with more Advanced books, bringing in monsters and magic items inspired by the Advanced rules.\n\nDeluxe Quality\nAll books in these deluxe editions will be high quality hardcovers with sewn bindings. In addition to their high durability, a great thing about books with a sewn binding is that they can lay open flat!\nWhat's more, we have stretch goals lined up for extra trimmings, to further increase the quality of these books. See below for more info on what we have planned, if the initial funding goal is surpassed.\nThe Team\nWondering who's behind all of this? Allow us to elucidate:\nGavin Norman: Author of Old-School Essentials (and formerly B/X Essentials), co-creator and principle author of the critically acclaimed Dolmenwood campaign setting, and founder of Necrotic Gnome. Gavin has driven the Old-School Essentials project since its inception, and is the mastermind behind the writing, editing, and layout.\nAndrew Walter: Visual genius behind a vista of weirdness, including Dolmenwood and Troika! Andrew's flights of imaginative fantasy feature on the covers of the five books in the Black Box. Four of these are complete (as shown in the product mock-up above). Andrew is now working on a completely new cover for the Core Rules book in the Black Box.\nPeter Mullen: Revered for his fantastically imaginative work on the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG and many other old-school games, Peter is working on a brand new piece that will grace the cover of the Black Box and the Rules Tome, and full 4-panel art for the front of the referee screen!\nStefan Poag: Prolific and beloved creator of weird and wonderful fantasy art, including many pieces for the Mutant Crawl Classics RPG, Metamorphosis Alpha, and many others. Stefan created the cover art for the Advanced Fantasy rules modules.\nInterior artists: A crack team of artists is tackling the interior illustration of the books, including: Luka Rejec, Matt Ray, Michael Clarke, Alex Mayo, Tom Kilian, Sean Poppe, Kyle Latino, Thomas Novosel.\nPlus full-colour art plates by: Thomas Denmark, Rachel Quinlan, Jon Hodgson, Olivia Politz, Tom Kilian, Sam Mameli, Emma Lazauski.\nWhat's This About 1981?\nThe 1981 Basic/Expert Fantasy Adventure Game sets (also known as B/X) have experienced a vibrant renaissance over the last decade. Many players have returned to (or discovered for the first time!) the simple rules and imaginative open space of the Basic/Expert game, with the focus on ease of play, adventure, wonder, and mystery.\nRenewed interest in this vintage game has led to the creation of a wide array of retro-clones: games that restate or are inspired by the rules of the Basic/Expert sets. In fact, the B/X rules (and games based on them) are the most popular rules in use in the old-school gaming scene.\nOld-School Essentials is exactly such a retro-clone, and we're immensely proud to be a part of the renaissance of these beloved rules.\n100% Rules Accuracy\nThe material in the Black Box and the Rules Tome forms a complete retelling of the classic Basic/Expert rules, including all of the classic fantasy classes, spells, monsters, and treasures.\nOld-School Essentials has been developed with equal measures of love and precision. The ultimate aim of this project is to produce as accurate as possible a restatement of the revered B/X rules, while improving the structure and presentation, and fixing errors and contradictions in the original rules. (For those with a passion for rules archaeology, this document describes all the areas of the Basic/Expert rules which are clarified in Old-School Essentials.)\nThe resulting books are the product of over two years of meticulous research, rules archaeology, and discussion.\nA Single Optional Addition \u2014 Ascending Armour Class\nModern iterations of the world's most popular RPG use an Armour Class system where AC values start at 10 and go up. This is known as Ascending Armour Class. (The default Armour Class system in B/X has AC starting at 9 and going down, known as Descending Armour Class.)\nFor those more familiar or comfortable with Ascending Armour Class, this optional rule has been fully integrated into Old-School Essentials. All AC ratings are presented in a dual format, for example: AC 7 [12].\nThis is the single rule we've added to the game that is not present in the original Basic/Expert rules, and it is strictly optional \u2014 Descending AC remains the default.\n\n\u20ac16,000 \u2013 Purist Character Sheet [UNLOCKED]\nDesigned by Gavin Norman.

That said, Necrotic Gnome has been relentlessly producing high quality old-school content since 2012. The team behind Old-School Essentials is by no means new to producing games! We are renowned for our communicative and transparent development process, so you can be sure of receiving a steady stream of updates as the project progresses.\n\nThe risks involved in this project are low. The text of the Rules Tome and the books in the Black Box is 100% finished. The layout of all books is done. The cover art for most of the books is done. About 50% of the interior illustrations are in place. All that remains, development-wise, is for the artists to get working on the final illustrations, to be slotted into the layout.\n\nWe've previously worked with the printer who'll be manufacturing the books, so their professionalism and commitment to high quality are known factors. They do excellent work, fast.\n\nThe box manufacturer isn't someone we've worked with before, so that is a slight unknown, but in case of an utter fall-through in communication, we have a second box manufacturer lined up.\n\nAs for the stretch goals, the majority of them are designed such that they will not add delays to the production and fulfillment of the main campaign goals:\n\u2022 The physical upgrades to the books don't entail any additional development time. (They just cost extra!)\n\u2022 The referee screen (as noted above) will be shipped separately from the books / box, so any unexpected delays in development there will not delay the whole project.\n\u2022 Development of all the digital stretch goals (character sheet PDFs, the rules reference website, etc.) likewise does not impact the delivery of the books / box.\n\nThe stretch goals that require additional print production (the Advanced books and the introductory adventure) are the main extras that could, in principle, cause delays. However, all of those products are already written. They just need to be laid out and illustrated. This extra work has already been factored into the planned shipping dates, so the risk is minimal.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac10 or more", "title": "Halfling", "descp": "PDF of the Rules Tome.\nINCLUDES:\nRules Tome PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["59 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac10 or more", "title": "Sprite", "descp": "PDFs of all books in the Black Box.\nINCLUDES:\nBlack Box book PDFs", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["90 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac15 or more", "title": "Gnome", "descp": "PDFs of the Rules Tome and all books in the Black Box.\nINCLUDES:\nRules Tome PDF\nBlack Box book PDFs", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["321 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac25 or more", "title": "Fighter", "descp": "The Rules Tome \u2014 at the special Kickstarter price!\nShipping will be charged in BackerKit, after the campaign.\nINCLUDES:\nRules Tome deluxe all-in-one hardcover\nAll Rules Tome physical upgrade stretch goals\nRules Tome PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["658 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac45 or more", "title": "Dwarf", "descp": "The limited edition, foil stamped, leatherette cover Rules Tome.\nShipping will be charged in BackerKit, after the campaign.\nINCLUDES:\nLimited super-deluxe Rules Tome with stamped leatherette cover\nAll Rules Tome physical upgrade stretch goals\nRules Tome PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["110 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac50 or more", "title": "Magic-User", "descp": "The Black Box.\nShipping will be charged in BackerKit, after the campaign.\nINCLUDES:\nBlack Box containing 5 deluxe hardcover rule books\nAll Black Box physical upgrade stretch goals\nBlack Box book PDFs", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["582 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac70 or more", "title": "Elf", "descp": "The Rules Tome plus the Black Box.\nShipping will be charged in BackerKit, after the campaign.\nINCLUDES:\nRules Tome deluxe all-in-one hardcover\nAll Rules Tome physical upgrade stretch goals\nBlack Box containing 5 deluxe hardcover rule books\nAll Black Box physical upgrade stretch goals\nRules Tome PDF\nBlack Box book PDFs", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["603 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac75 or more", "title": "Retail Fighter", "descp": "Five copies of the Rules Tome for retail.

Whatever version of Oceans you pledge for, it will automatically come with a 5-6 player expansion.\nThe Evolution games are known for vivid themes, easy rules, and hidden depth. With many thousands of play-tests, years of non-stop design, over 100 unique illustrations, and more content than we've ever put into a game before, Oceans is our most ambitious project to date.\nAt the game's start, the only food source is plankton, the foundation of the ocean food web. It populates the beautifully illustrated Reef and Ocean boards, shown here as prototypes: \n(Note the fish tokens you see above are off-the-shelf items we used for testing. The actual tokens will be cardboard for the standard edition and acrylic for the deluxe edition. See below.)\nYour goal is to create and evolve species so they find their niche in the growing ecosystem, by giving them helpful combinations of traits. This is a what a species looks like: \nEach species is defined by its population (the fish tokens above), and its traits (the cards above). Through the game It'll gain and lose traits, and gain and lose population depending on what it can eat, and what can eat it. Despite your best efforts, some species will go extinct! It's natural selection at work. \nBecause you can build species from any combination of traits, thousands of species are possible, and they all interact in their own particular ways as the ecosystem builds. Every game creates a one-of-a-kind world, never to be seen again.   \nMany species will be predators, each bigger than the next, all the way up to the dreaded apex predator. But some will eat in other ways, for example by scavenging on the sea bottom or filter-feeding on plankton. Below are examples of trait art - each a watercolor painting by famed nature artist Catherine Hamilton:\nThen there's a whole other side to the game. It's called The Deep. \nHuge regions of deep ocean are unexplored, and what little we've seen of them can seem like fantasy:\nWe had to put this mysterious world into the game. Hence The Deep.\nThe Deep will contain, at minimum, 50 unique, powerful traits, which dramatically boost the range - and strangeness - of species you can evolve. We commissioned scores of illustrations from a variety of fine artists to make them. Here are examples:   \nThrough unlocked stretch goals, at least 32 additional Deep cards may become permanently added to the game. \nBeyond those, there are also 8 foiled Deep promo cards to unlock. These foiled traits are more aggressive and/or complex than the other cards in the game. \nWith all stretch goals unlocked, you'll get more than 90 unique Deep cards in total. They raise the number of distinct species you can evolve from thousands to about one million.\nEach time you play, there are 2 scenario cards in play (chosen at random at the start of the game from a deck of at least 25). Each creates a major ecosystem-shift when activated, altering the whole game. It's another way the evolutionary timeline changes each play.\nThe standard scenario deck can create about 600 distinct Ocean histories to evolve through, but we're also offering up to 13 more scenario cards as stretch goals. With those added, about 1500 Ocean histories are possible. \nWe've packed all this into rules that are simpler, more intuitive, and easier to teach even than Evolution, which was already known for being easy to teach. Nonetheless you'll find tons of hidden tactics and strategies...under the surface. \nNote: Oceans is mechanically quite different from previous Evolution games. See this update for details.  \n For every pledge level, at the end of the campaign, you'll choose between English, French, Spanish and Italian versions of Oceans in the pledge manager. You can pledge for as many copies as you wish.\n North Star Games will publish the English version\n Funforge will publish the French version. Pour voir cette page en fran\u00e7ais, cliquez ici! \n Schwerkraft-Verlag will publish the German Edition. \n Ediciones MasQueOca will publish the Spanish version. You can read their updates about Oceans at their blog here.\n Pendragon Game Studio will publish the Italian version. To read about this campaign in, click here.\nStandard Edition Pledge Level - $45 USD ($5 off MSRP)\nYou get the Oceans Standard Edition and all unlocked stretch goals. \nThe Standard Edition contains:  1 Rulebook, 1 Reference Guide, 2 Player aids, 1 Reef board, 3 Ocean boards (2 small, 1 large), 120 Surface cards (10 of each type), 50-80 Deep cards (1 of each type), 24 Scenario cards, 24 Species boards, 200 cardboard fish with 6 different illustrated designs (see below), 4 Player screens, and 4 Bonus Score tokens. Note exact numbers of some components could change with final game tweaks.\nThe 5-6 player expansion contains 40 additional fish, 2 extra player screens, 2 extra bonus score tokens, and 10 extra species boards.  \nNote: unlike in the prototype pictured above, the final cardboard fish will be illustrated on both sides: \nDeluxe Edition Pledge Level - $70 ($15 off MSRP)\nYou get Oceans' Deluxe Edition and all unlocked stretch goals. The Deluxe Edition improves on the Standard Edition in the following ways:\nIncludes 240 deluxe translucent acrylic fish tokens in addition to the cardboard fish of the standard edition, so you can decide how you want to play. The acrylic fish are more durable, easier to handle, and they refract light beautifully. Our goal is to make them as delicious-looking and as tactile as possible. We'll have done our job if your first instinct is to eat them. Prototype:\nThe final version may look even better, as they'll have smooth, beveled edges.\nIncludes custom-printed, premium food bags for up to 6 players for storing your points, instead of cardboard player screens. They feel super-silky, they have drawstrings, and they help keep your playing area neat and compact. \nIncludes 220 custom Oceans premium matte card sleeves, for sleeving both the core trait cards and The Deep trait cards, plus spares. \nBox Cover Art Painting Pledge Level - $3000\nYou get the Deluxe Edition, all unlocked stretch goals, and Catherine Hamilton's original 12\" x 12\" watercolor painting for the Box Cover. Because the painting is one-of-a-kind, only one backer can pledge this level: \nPledge levels which are no longer available\nThere are a number of pledge levels with backer limits that have been reached, and so are no longer available. To simplify this page, we've removed descriptions of these levels for now. We'll add them back in if any become available again.\nWhatever language you choose for your game, your stretch goals will also come in that language. There are three types of stretch goals: \n Deep Cards: Unlocked Deep traits that will become a permanent part of both the Standard and Deluxe Editions. Each card that isn't unlocked may be available on our website for $2.  \n Foiled Deep Cards: Promo Deep traits that are more aggressive and/or complex than normal Deep traits. After the campaign, each foiled card may be available on our website for $3 if there are any left over. \n Scenario Cards: Promo scenarios that are wackier than the standard scenarios. Some are downright goofy. After the campaign, each scenario card may be available on our website for $1 if there are any left over. \nThe total value of all stretch goals is more than $100.\nYou can order as many of each add-on as you like. Note the non-digital add-ons will add extra shipping cost, which will be charged after the campaign ends in our pledge manager.\nEvolution (English or Italian) - add $40 to your pledge for each English copy, $35 for each Italian copy\nEvolution is an award-winning board game where 2 \u2013 6 players adapt terrestrial species in an ever changing ecosystem with hungry predators and limited resources.

It has been ruled for generations by the birdfolk who inhabit the Great Tree-City of Alderheart. Humblewood has endured for centuries thanks to the industry and compassion of its people...\n...but now the fires have come, and the Woods have been thrown into chaos. Flames ravage the land and destroy the homes of the humblefolk, stoking a growing resentment against the birdfolk, whose cities have managed to avoid the worst of the fires so far. Hatred burns in the hearts of those who have lost lives they cherished, and these once peaceful peoples now take up the sword and turn to banditry. The disaffected turn their gaze on Alderheart, and threaten to reduce an age of peace to ashes... \n...yet there is still hope. Even in these dark times, brave heroes can be found within the Wood. Only they can quell the raging flames that have been unleashed upon the land, and restore balance to the realm. Will you answer the call?    \nResidents of Humblewood\nThe Birdfolk \n\nThe birdfolk races have ruled over Humblewood from their canopy villages and fortified cities for as long as anyone can remember. Play as one of the five core birdfolk races:\nThe astute crow-like Corvum who safeguard Humblewood\u2019s knowledge\nThe dignified fowl-like Gallus who have faith in the power of community\nThe aloof pidgeon-like Lumas who use their gifts to bring joy into the world\nThe agile hawk-like Raptors who blaze new trails through the forest\nThe powerful owl-like Strig who defend what they believe is right\nThe Humblefolk\nThe humblefolk live in small villages throughout the Wood, but are occasionally found in birdfolk cities.

Under the guidance of a new leader, they seek to exact retribution upon the birdfolk cities and sow discord throughout the Wood.\nMonsters of Humblewood\nThe Oozes\nDeep within the murk of the Mokk Fields live several species of this most resilient life-form. Battle your way through caustic slimes whose touch is a deadly acid, sticky slimes that can suck a weapon right out of your hand, and the rare shifting slimes which feed on magical energies to become ever stronger. \nThe Beasts\nHumblewood is home to a variety of beasts whose size, strength, and abilities can only have grown thanks to the Wood\u2019s magic.

Welcome to an exciting new 5E universe from Lasers & Liches! It is an unbound universe bursting with half-faded memories, barely remembered songs, lost childhood friends, outdated styles, vaporwave, abandoned dreams, lost playthings, vaporware, and time corroded nostalgia. A place both strange and familiar. A place  for adventure,chaos, friendship, and the magic of yesteryear. In short, a place that combines your love of the present with your adoration of the past. \nDo you feel like your 5E game might be  missing something? Maybe a little Retro-Futurism?  We did too! It's time to get weird, time to get crazy, time for more freaking laser corgis! Lasers & Liches mixes untethered creativity with sci-fantasy and wraps it in the veneer of  yesteryear. Expect neon swords, Code Dragons, Pizza Slimes, and so much nostalgia inspired world building. Don't worry though, we know that your memories are sacred, and that's why we're going to treat them with care. This was our childhood too and we are giving it the respect it darn well deserves. Callbacks are easy, and this ain't gonna be easy.  \nSo, what is the Retroverse? Technically speaking, the Retroverse is an unstable plane. It is constantly expanding, contracting, and gaining new extensions. It wobbles on an uneven axis among the other planes of existence. Because if this, it eventually intersects all  realities in one way or another. There is no point in time when it is not linked to multiple realms at once. Where the Retroverse ends, begins, or even exists at any given time is an impossible question to  answer. \nThis means that you can take anything, from any 5E setting, and mash it together. Classic 5E content, mixed with Retroverse classes and species, fighting other 3rd party monsters, across a setting from your favorite cartoon?! You betcha! This doesn't overhaul 5E with a bunch of revised rules, it just makes the game cooler in every way. \nOur Website: LasersAndLiches.com\n We are creating a full 5E universe and need your help to bring it to life. This Kickstarter is focused on finalizing our content and bringing it all together into a two-book PDF format. (Why only PDF? See below) These will include new classes, playable species, spells, monsters, magic items, mechanics, deities, story, and a bunch more! We have been tirelessly pouring over our art and design to give you the best possible 5E experience and just need your assistance to bring it to light. The two PDFs we want to bring to you are The Player's Mix and The Game Master's Beats. Both will be filled to the brim with beautiful art, fun new options, and a few surprises. We have a minimum idea in mind for each and some really exciting features to include if we hit certain stretch goals. \nTo those that have followed our project so far, you know what you're getting into. We released our First Test Wave of content for free on DriveThruRPG. Well, we are happy to announce that we have the Second Test Wave ready to go! It is well over 400 pages of new or revised content just waiting for you to play. Backers will get this content within a few days of the campaign ending in successful funding. You can play with all our new stuff almost as soon as the campaign ends!\nThe Player's Mix:  This PDF will be everything a player needs to bring their Retroverse  character to life in their own world. It will feature at least 4 new classes, 4 new playable species, 4 new backgrounds, 40 new spells, 8 new feats, new sub-classes and sub-species for classic 5E, and a few other surprises!\nThese numbers begin to jump dramatically as we unlock more stretch goals. We also have a few more surprises to add in that we think you'll enjoy. \nThe Game Master's Beats: This PDF will dive deep into the lore of The Retroverse. It will offer new rules, a full campaign, 40 new magic items, 40 new monsters, a world map, and rules for adapting and creating your own settings in the Retroverse!\nJust like the Player's Mix, this will receive a huge boon if we hit certain stretch goals. Which includes but is not limited to: An expanded campaign, remixed questlines, more magic items, more monster stat blocks, and we will release a very unique type of lich upon your world!\n If you have been following our project, you may know that we tried a Kickstarter once before. We were well on our way to funding but overestimated some things. So, after only 4 days, we pulled the project before anyone was charged. We've written at length about why but the TL;DR version is that the extra goals we had in place would not be worth it to backers and pull too heavily from the project, making the whole thing suffer. So we went back to the drawing board, spent around a year improving our product, and are coming back with a more focused goal. This Kickstarter is almost entirely geared on just finishing the project in the most affordable (for us and backers) way possible. \nThe biggest changes to the game have already been made and are in our second test wave. The content now includes: 5 new playable species, 6 new classes (4 with 3 new sub-classes), 7 new backgrounds, 80+ new spells, 70+ new monster stat blocks, new sub-classes for core 5E classes, improved corruption, a new cliche mechanic, more deities, expanded basic equipment, and a bunch bunch more. \nYou may notice that this is above some of our previous stretch goals and even above our base content offered in this Kickstarter. That's because we are committed to not just delivering, but over delivering on this project. If we only hit the base funding, we will scale the project back a touch and include just a little more than you hoped for. With every new stretch goal, we increase the content coming towards you and bring an even more insane experience to your table. It's up to you to decide the final outcome!\nWe thought you needed more dinosaurs.\nWe thought you needed more dragons too.\nIf we already have a base product, why Kickstart it? There are 3 major reasons but the biggest one is editing is expensive. Lets break down all 3.\n Editing: Editing costs money, editing a lot of content (such as our game) costs a lot of money. Properly paying an editor is way beyond our meager capabilities, so we need your help to get there. This is where the bulk of all funding is going. \n Not Done: While we have a ton of content created, we are not quite where we want to be. We are still in development and our team has families and bills. Creating in our off time has spawned a huge amount of content, imagine what we could do if we could worry a bit less about food. \n Immortalize You: The Retroverse has been a community project since its first inception as a string of tweets. We love how much people enjoy our universe and the different ways they interact with it. This Kickstarter gives us the chance to get you into the universe canonically, making you a permanent part of this world. \nYes, our game has Laser Corgis. No, you shouldn't pet them.\n When we went back to the Kickstarter drawing board, we decided we wanted to keep the next one very tight. This was our way of focusing on the project without lots of fees, taxes, shipping, and other headaches nibbling away at the funds until nothing was left. Once the PDFs are finalized and fully distributed, we will be running another Kickstarter for the hardcover books (in addition to some other cool merchandise) but that is not this Kickstarter. The focus now is project completion and giving you a hand in development. The hardcover copy Kickstarter will have awesome rewards, but none that get you in the main books like this one. \nPrint on Demand through DriveThruRPG (which is who will be fulfilling the PDF distribution) is a great option for many creators but is not the route we want to take. There are some surprises we have planned that they simply cannot do. We know there is a great desire for physical books, and we want them as well, but not as much as we want to bring you the best game possible. Without this Kickstarter campaign, a physical book will continue to remain beyond our means. We need your help now to bring this project from a dream, to your table. \nThe Nostalgia Blaster stretch goal is the only tier that will have physical rewards. We're saving some of the details until it is unlocked but it will include a set of our Tesla Dragon dice (below), some exclusive slap bracelets, an exclusive laser corgi pin, and a few other surprises. This will be the only way to get these items as well, as only the dice will ever see a reprint and not for a long time. \nAll Retroverse dice are crafted by Luck Gnomes.\nThis isn't our first dice/bracelet rodeo.\nLooks like we have unlocked the Nostalgia Blaster tier! It is available as a full tier or as an add-on. If you are at the Tester tier or higher, simply add $25 to your pledge and its added automatically. Anyone backing us over $100 already has this pack added to their tier at no extra charge. It's our way of thanking you for backing us big and early. Shipping will be charged in BackerKit once the campaign ends. We also unlock extra stuff for the pack each time we hit a new stretch goal. What stuff? Keep up with our updates to find out! \nThe dice are based on the Tesla Dragon, seen here with the Laser, Xenon, and Neon dragons.\n What are some of the new Classes we want to introduce? The full base game will include the Holo-Knight, Synth Weaver, Henshin (formerly Goreangyr), and De-Fragger! You can see pictures of them below. We also hope to expand the roster (with your funding help) to include the Apogee (formerly Code Warlock), Glitch Hunter, Datamancer, and Icon. We promise to work on them until they are as fun as can possibly be!\nAll the classes available in the First Test Wave have been broken apart, injected with essence of cool, and put back together with 3 new sub-classes! The Holo-Knight now has the Hard, Soft, and Quantum Light sub-classes. The Synth Weaver now has the Beat Booster, Beat Mixer, and Beat Breaker possibilities (as well as a complete backbone overhaul). The Henshin now includes three mask types, Power, Magic, and Speed, depending on which type of spandex warrior you want to employ. And the De-Fragger has the Vaccine, Data, and Virus sub-classes, depending on how you handle corruption. We've spent a ton of time working on them (and taking your feedback) to make them even cooler than they already were. \nClockwise from the top: Synthweaver, De-Fragger, Glitch Hunter, Henshin, Holo-Knight, Apogee.\nOne of our Holo-Knight sub-classes.\nA Restless Vaccine De-Fragger.\nA Beat Mixer Synthweaver.\nA Speed Mask Henshin riding their Network Cycle.\nThere is a lot to the Retroverse. A LOT. In order to make it manageable and to continue to be able to test new and exciting features (and sleep!), we are breaking the testing period into waves. It also allows you to play with our stuff as its being developed, no waiting for the final versions to play! When the Kickstarter  ends (if we are funded) we will release the second wave to anyone over a certain backer level (this will be the only way to get this content for now). It includes well over 400 pages of brand new content! You can play with some of the new classes and sub-classes, playable species, magic, monsters, magic items, and rules almost immediately! It also comes with the next chapter in the Warren's Grove campaign, giving you two missions (3 with our free Halloween special) to play! Each new wave will have an additional quest, growing to the eventual full campaign to be included in the Game Master's Beats. (There will also be some missions in the Game Master's Beats that are not available in the test waves.)\nIn a few months time we will release the third test wave. There is not a set date for this as the amount of  content within the third test wave is highly dependent on how  successful the Kickstarter is. We want to make sure that, even though we are still testing it, we release quality content to you. We are not going to rush this project. If there needs to be more test waves, then we simply do more. \nAs a backer you will have full access to the development process with frequent updates. You will know exactly when the third (and maybe more) test waves are coming!\n If you would like to try a sample of what we are making, head on over to our DriveThruRPG page and download the Silver Best Selling (NOW ELECTRUM) First Test Wave or our Halloween Special. They're 200+ combined pages of pure awesome. Did we mention they are free? \nLasers & Liches First Test Wave  \nLasers & Liches Halloween Special\n You can also see some live play sessions of our game here. \nA possible \"shiny\" version of a dragon wyrmling.\n Here's what some people have been saying about the Retroverse!\n As we hit certain stretch goals, we will reveal more specifics about each one. \n\nUpdated 3/10\n\nChris Lock and LLuis Abadias are the powerhouse duo that comprise the entirety of the Lasers & Liches team. After bonding over a mutual love of the absurd nature of retro-futurism, a general malaise for traditional fantasy, and a love of lasers, they began working on the Retroverse project. Their love of the silly, love for their community, and love for each other has pushed this project to places neither of them would have thought possible. Between the two of them, they have run years of games, created several mildly successful projects, and generated a ton of free content for the TTRPG community. They both live on twitter.

I can only apologize so much before it becomes stale. I hate that everything has turned out in, quite possibly, the worst way it could. We started very strong, and have done cool stuff, but the immensity of this project and my own personal life crushed me. All that being said, I am proud of what we have made so far. It's not finished, not by a bit, but it's dang cool and it's a lot of dang cool. All I can really tell you is that I've done my best, we will finish it, and that it hasn't been abandoned.

The final chapter of Warren's Grove has been the main focus for a bit but we just finished work on the Datamancer. That class took a while to get to something that will actually be fun to play and is going to require lots of breaking. We've also been shoring up the content that's already been released to (hopefully deliver a less broken version of) everything in Test Wave 3. None of this is nice and flashy yet and is taking a long time on my part, which is why there has been a lack of updates. I'm very sorry about that, I just hate having nothing exciting to show as the bar for our content is (in my opinion at least) pretty high. Updates like this can be just as frustrating as having no update (again, in my opinion). All that being said, we're very close to being done with everything (we've already hit the number of things we said and then some on most of the content already released) that is going into Test Wave 3, and then it's just a matter of putting it in our new format and splitting it into its separate books, instead of the massive tome it has been. All that's really missing from the core content is finishing the Warren's Grove questline (Black Castle) and adding more backer content.

Over the past decade, our library of gateway and filler games have entertained, inspired, and provided an opportunity to make memories around the game table, and it all started with our flagship title, Tsuro: The Game of the Path.  We couldn\u2019t think of a better way to celebrate this 10 year milestone than by returning to the series that started it all - so we welcome you to the launch of a brand new Tsuro game!\nLong ago, a vengeful god stole the stars from the night sky. To illuminate the night, brave people released glowing paper lanterns toward the heavens. This act of hope summoned clever magical phoenixes, who soared through the sky and raced toward the lanterns. \nAs the birds flew from lantern to lantern, their enchanted touch transformed the lanterns into brilliant new stars! Before the people's very eyes, the night sky became illuminated with beauty, all because of the firebirds.  The phoenix that creates a constellation of seven new stars will illuminate the night sky and once again restore balance to Tsuro...the path of life! \nIn Tsuro: Phoenix Rising, an exhilarating new entry in the classic Tsuro series, each player is a phoenix, soaring across the board in an effort to reach glowing lanterns and transform them into new stars in the night sky.  The first player to collect seven star tokens wins the game!\nTsuro: Phoenix Rising builds upon the foundation of classic Tsuro \u2013 you must play tiles to extend your path, traverse the board, and be aware of your surroundings \u2013 but it adds exciting new features such as double-sided path tiles that allow for diagonal movement and can be flipped and rotated to choose your destination, as well as a revolutionary new molded board.  As a phoenix, you also have the astounding ability to rise from the ashes and return to the board once per game! \nAll New Gameplay! \u2013 Become a phoenix!  Soar across the board, flipping and rotating the double-sided tiles to build your path on the revolutionary new modular board.\nNew Twist on classic Tsuro \u2013 Builds upon the foundation of Tsuro \u2013 create your path, stay on the board \u2013 but introduces exciting new elements such as set collection, strategic board manipulation\u2026and the ability to rise from your ashes and return!\nExclusive Kickstarter Content! \u2013 Pledge now so you don\u2019t miss out!  Kickstarter set comes with these exclusive items you won't find in stores later*:  \n* Exclusive content layout and visuals will vary from those pictured on this page.  Exclusive items may be sold by Calliope Games at conventions or online but will not be available through standard distribution.\nEvery copy of the game comes with:\n4 innovative game trays, which connect to form the game board\n36 double-sided Path tiles \n1 Phoenix tile \n1 translucent acrylic First Player marker\n8 Phoenix miniatures \n8 glass bead \"ash\" Life tokens \n7 \"glowing\" translucent Lantern markers: 3 Red, 2 Blue, and 2 Yellow\n50 golden Star tokens\n1 Rulebook\nThe Kickstarter Exclusive Set also features these upgrades and additional materials which will not be available as add-ons later:\nAnd every copy of the game will come with these unlocked stretch goals:\nHere's a closer look at some of the premium components included in every copy of the game:\nEight beautifully sculpted Phoenix miniatures\nSeven \"glowing\" translucent Lantern markers in three shapes.\nThe unique patented tray allows one tile to be flipped and rotated without disturbing the others.\n*Note that the final appearance of all components and upgrades may change. \nTsuro: Phoenix Rising is built on the foundation of the classic game Tsuro: The Game of the Path by Tom McMurchie.  Some core gameplay elements remain, such as placing tiles and moving your pawn along the path.  However, as a Phoenix, your turns in the game will now consist of extending your path, moving your Phoenix pawn, transforming Lanterns into Stars, and scoring Stars to make a constellation!\nFor additional copies of the standard retail edition of Tsuro: Phoenix Rising, manually add $40 per game to your pledge.  There is no extra shipping for one additional copy.  To receive 3-6 copies of the game, manually add double the shipping cost. \nPledge $20 now to be a part of the Tsuro: Phoenix Rising retailer program and receive your full margin plus 4 additional points for your support.  You may choose the Standard Retail Edition or Kickstarter Exclusive Set.  You will also have an opportunity to fill out your order with other Calliope titles at the same margin; FFA $350 (destination USA - See FAQ for details).  Retailer orders will be shipped with all other Kickstarter orders prior to standard distribution. Your final order and payment will not be finalized until the game is ready to ship.  Orders must be placed in case quantities (6 units per case); maximum two cases per location. \nPhysical store verification will be required; you must provide the store name, store address, phone number, EIN number, and website or Facebook page. If you choose this option and we determine you are not a brick-and-mortar retailer, you will be charged the difference in price for one standard retail edition of Tsuro: Phoenix Rising after the campaign. No refunds will be issued. Result of the verification process by Calliope Games will be final.  \nNOTE: International retailer copies will be shipped at the same time as all international backer copies; international freight forwarding may cause delays in fulfillment.  \nThe truth is, we packed all possible quality and value in the presentation of Tsuro: Phoenix Rising.  Upgraded tile thickness?  Done.  Fancy components?  Included.  Amazing tray?  You got it!!  So we can't approach stretch goals the same way other campaigns might.\nInstead, we are going to treat stretch goals as a bonus for backers, to celebrate the entire Tsuro series!\nEveryone at the Standard Retail Edition, Kickstarter Exclusive Set, Legacy of Tsuro, or Way of the Retailer pledge levels will receive all unlocked stretch goals when Tsuro: Phoenix Rising is fulfilled!  No additional charge or shipping will be required!  \nA note about grouping multiple copies of Tsuro: Phoenix Rising:\nEach copy of Tsuro: Phoenix Rising at the Standard Retail Edition, Kickstarter Exclusive Set, Legacy of Tsuro, or Way of the Retailer levels will come with one of each stretch goal item, so you can put together a group pledge and every copy will come with the goodies!  This also means retailers will be able to provide the stretch goal items for all copies!\nWe are offering subsidized shipping costs in order to strike the best balance of value for our backers and actual cost to us. We have strategically partnered with trusted fulfillment partners around the world experienced in shipping Kickstarter rewards.\n*See Update #2 for list of EU Neighbor countries. \nThe above costs reflect the Standard Retail Edition and Kickstarter Exclusive Set pledge levels; Way of the Retailer and Legacy of Tsuro levels may be slightly higher due to quantity of boxes to be shipped.  Shipping costs will be charged after the campaign ends through CrowdOx. \n10 years ago, Calliope Games began as a collaboration between Dawne Weisman, Jordan Weisman, and Ray Wehrs. All of us are experienced game industry professionals who have worked together since 1999 when we collectively launched WizKids. Calliope Games has been producing and selling quality tabletop games since 2009. Our products are inspired by family for families. To date we have released 19 titles, many of which were brought to life here on Kickstarter!\nAt Calliope Games, we publish fun, affordable, family-style tabletop games for all to enjoy.  \nWith gamers in mind, our games make the perfect \"gateway\" or \"filler\" game. They allow you to easily draft your non-gamer friends into your favorite hobby. Calliope games are excellent for starting out game night and are easily played between heavier games. It\u2019s important to point out to our non-gamer friends that we do take a slightly different approach to the games we produce. At Calliope, we focus on entertaining adults; however, the games we produce allow children to compete with their parents without the parents \u201cthrowing\u201d the game. It\u2019s a really a pretty simple concept; instead of having the parents step down into the child\u2019s world, we are inviting the child to step up into the parents' world.  \nFor gamers and non-gamers alike, the results of our efforts are games that are accessible by all players regardless of skill level or age, play in under 60 minutes, are affordably priced, and most of all\u2026 are a blast to play!\nIf you would like to add other amazing games from our catalog to your pledge, you may do so by manually adjusting your pledge using the amounts below.  The appropriate shipping will be collected post-campaign when the survey is sent.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith any venture, there are risks... those that are seen, and those that are unseen. The biggest foreseeable risks we currently face are manufacturing in China and shipping issues from China to our warehouse here in the US.\n\nEach of these risks is greatly minimized with Calliope Games. Our factories have been with us for many years. They know how we work and the quality we expect. In addition, our freight forwarder and fulfillment teams are world class and have over 30 years of expertise to rely upon. If any issues arise, we will know of them far in advance and will be able to overcome them.\n\nUpcoming tariffs may influence costs as well. Typically these are 10%-25% of our total manufacturing cost. Should tariffs affect prices, these will be reflected in the post-campaign shipping and fulfillment cost.\n\nAs far as the unseen risks... we know they are there and we have built a safety margin into our costs of goods sold to prepare us for the unforeseen.

I've found strength and solace in others' work throughout my life, and it is my hope that this album provides a place of restful healing for you as well. \nI'm asking for your help funding the production of my debut album! It is the first of its kind, carving out a healing world, a new genre that combines video game hardware, acoustic instruments, and ethereal vocals. And a tour! With 3 cities already confirmed in North America, I look forward to meeting all you lovely humans. \nYou may have heard my voice on tracks that I\u2019ve done with friends in the EDM world.\nWhat do you do?\nI produce music under the name Azuria Sky. In the past few years I\u2019ve written numerous songs and performed them at multiple shows around the country. If you\u2019re familiar with the chipmusic scene, you\u2019ll know that this was my home, where I have spent most of my time growing.\nPulsewave / Babycastles - New York, NY (@lippemfg)\nPhoto: @lippemfg\nBabycastles - New York, NY\nWayward Social - Brooklyn, NY (@lippemfg)\nI use old video game hardware in conjunction with acoustic guitar and piano to create this very raw fabric of sound to sing over. I first experimented with this combination in the song Listen_, the opening track of my album Gravity, which I released in 2015.\nThis new album is a conscious exploration of that sound -- it\u2019s an auditory portrait of emotions I have seen and felt over the past 3 years. It\u2019s very personal. I think the music that I write is the most intimate way I can express what I\u2019ve been through, and the only way I know how to connect with and uplift others. \nThree years and 3,000 miles later, I have arrived in Los Angeles, ready to start a new chapter. \nThank you for supporting my work. I hope it brings you as much solace and healing as it has for me. \nPulsewave / Babycastles - New York, NY (@lippemfg)\nWhat is the difference between composition and production?\nComposition is the process of birthing the song -- it is when I figure out what note goes where, what sound goes beep and what sound goes TWANG. I try to get these ideas down as quickly as possible, so many of these drafts are full of background noise and static, often recorded on my phone.\nAll the drafts are fully composed, and ready to for me to hunker down over to produce and package into delivery ready MP3s! The next phase is production.\nProduction is the part that requires meticulous attention, and can be quite arduous. This is when the audio cables and mixing board comes out. It\u2019s the journey of sitting in front of the microphone and playing dozens of takes until you find the perfect phrasing and timbre. It's when the pop-filter rescues the microphone from condensation formed by me breathing on it for a billion hours. It\u2019s the task of shaping sounds, making sure each instrument and each detail is delivered with the utmost clarity. Production is the process that brings the ideas and notes to life, it\u2019s where the magic enters the mix. \nWhy do you need my help?\nCommercial recording studio costs are prohibitively expensive. Most run anywhere from 300-500 USD per session.\nDigital music production has progressed drastically over the past decade, and with dedication and time it is 100% possible to produce radio quality music in a home studio. \nI\u2019m a one-person team. With an absurd amount of self-motivation, a hearty dose of confidence, and several years of experience under my belt, I need your help so that I can focus all my efforts over the next few months towards bringing this album to you.\nSo that leads to the question --\nWhy are you self-releasing?\nBitxBit, Digital Arts Demo Space - Chicago, IL (@chiptography)\nWith an overarching project of this magnitude, it makes sense to navigate from the captain\u2019s chair whenever possible. Relying on someone else to package and deliver your experience adds more moving parts to the equation.

A pair of Joy-con rails on either side of the grip allow you to flip the Switch 90 degrees for vertical handheld action. \nThe Switch has become an amazing machine for playing classic games on-the-go. Classic titles are being re-released on the Switch at a rapid pace, with new ones coming out each week. \nMany Switch re-releases of classic titles, like those from Namco and SNK, include display options to rotate the game\u2019s display 90\u00ba for games that appeared in arcade cabinets with vertical-mode screens.\nOn previous consoles, few people could make use of vertical-mode orientation features \u2014 it's hard to turn a television sideways, after all. A few PSP games supported rotation, but playing an intense arcade shooter while you grip the top and bottom of the PSP was far from a great experience. \nThe Switch changes everything. Because you can remove the Joy-Cons from the system, we can finally play classics like Punch-Out!!, Galaga, and Strikers 1945-II properly in vertical mode.\nHowever, Nintendo never designed the Switch to be used in portable vertical mode. The system's Joy-Con rails only allow you to hold the Switch in horizontal mode.\nUntil now, using the Switch in vertical mode required propping up the console sideways on a stand to use as a tabletop system. That's better than nothing, but it doesn't get to the heart of what Switch is all about: portability.\nThe Flip Grip makes portable vertical-mode gaming possible. Simply slide the Switch into the Flip Grip, then attach Joy-Cons, and voila \u2014 a handheld system capable of playing vertical-mode games without wasting a single pixel of real estate. \nWith publishers like SNK and Capcom releasing new classic titles for the Switch, the number of games available to play in vertical mode will only grow. And not just classic games \u2014 modern releases like Ikaruga include vertical-mode support, too. \nAnd the Flip Grip is the key to being able to enjoy these releases on-the-go.\nNote that this is a 3D printed prototype and is not representative of the final product.\nThe Flip Grip consists of a single piece of durable injection-molded plastic designed to hold the Switch rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise. Slide the Switch in until it clicks into place, then slide the Joy-Cons into the rails on either side just like you would on the console. \nThe rails on the Flip Grip are designed to emulate the same rails you find on the Switch itself, so installation and removal of Joy-Cons is easy and familiar.  \nThe Flip Grip has been designed to accept the Switch in only one direction (90 degrees counterclockwise). This orientation exposes the game card and SD card slots, as well as the headphone jack.  \nYou don't need to worry about inserting the console the wrong way \u2014 the inner edge of the Flip Grip is specially molded to the shape of the Switch, and won't allow you to slide it in all the way in the wrong direction. \nThe Flip Grip also has a rubber bump on the inside that holds your Switch securely in place to prevent the console from falling out during active play sessions.\nTo release the Flip Grip, press the release buttons on each Joy-Con and slide them up to remove them. \nPull gently on the small release tab on the back side of the Flip Grip to unlock the Switch from the grip. \nThe Flip Grip isn't just for handheld gaming! You can also use it as a stand, too. One of the slots on the back of the Flip Grip allows you to use any credit card to prop up the Switch for social play\u2026 or just give your tired arms a break.\nThe Flip Grip is brought to you courtesy of a game nerd power trio:\nJeremy Parish/Retronauts: This project got its start when Retronauts podcast co-host and former 1UP/IGN/USgamer editor Jeremy Parish realized Namco Museum on Switch supported vertical play, but that Switch itself didn't. After it became clear that no one intended to bridge that gap, he began exploring the possibility of making it happen himself. \nMike Choi: As a hardware engineer, inventor, and avid video game player, Mike Choi took the Flip Grip concept from Jeremy\u2019s napkin sketch into a real-deal accessory. Through months of prototyping and iterating, Mike has arrived at an elegant, durable, and inexpensive design for the Flip Grip, as well as the Flip Grip\u2019s charming mascot, Flippy. \nFangamer: The glue that holds this project together, Fangamer's years of experience managing ventures like this has made Flip Grip possible. They connected Jeremy and Mike, consistently rolled 20s for sanity checks, and have midwifed this campaign into existence. \nThe hard work of designing and prototyping is complete, but manufacturing Flip Grip requires a commitment of thousands of dollars up-front, and it's important for us to be sure that an audience exists for such a niche product before sinking that much money into this beautiful dream of ours. \nAs such, this will be a very straightforward Kickstarter campaign. Want a Flip Grip? That's what the campaign is here for!\nThis isn't about some impossible, pie-in-the-sky dream: Flip Grip is fully designed and ready to manufacture. We\u2019ve got our vendors in place and they\u2019re ready to go. We just need to raise the funds to cut the tools that will be used to mass produce Flip Grip. \nFangamer has its own warehouse and distribution system, so the logistics of Flip Grip shipping are all in-hand. We\u2019ve set a target date of November for shipping Flip Grip.\nWhile Flip Grip production is locked in, there are still a few caveats we need to mention.\nVertical UI (or lack thereof)\nFirst, Nintendo didn't design Switch for use in vertical mode. That means Flip Grip is awesome for actually playing games that offer a screen rotation feature, but everything outside those games is going to appear and operate sideways \u2014 you know, systems menus and eShop and the like. You'll probably only want to make use of Flip Grip during gameplay.\nThat said, many developers do incorporate a rotated system interface inside games that support vertical mode. It's case-by-case, but some games will offer a better experience than others.\nFunctionality with Flip Grip\nThe other concern is, well, Nintendo really didn't design Switch for use in vertical mode. A few critical features run along Switch's upper and lower edges, and the Flip Grip unavoidably obstructs some of them.\nFlip Grip provides access to the headphone jack, SD Card slot, and Game Card slot. You can't access the physical power or volume buttons with the Flip Grip in place, but you can access volume, brightness and sleep options by long pressing the home button on the right Joy Con.\nThis is an inconvenience, no question about it \u2014 you need to slip the Switch out of the Flip Grip in order to power it off completely, or recharge its battery. Otherwise, you can still access most functionality by long pressing the home button and navigating the system menus, even when the Flip Grip is attached.\nVenting and Thermal Concerns\nOne of the biggest questions we\u2019ve seen about early teases of Flip Grip is around heat and venting issues. \u201cWon\u2019t the Flip Grip cause the Switch to overheat by covering the vents?\u201d\nUpon first glance, it may look like the Flip Grip covers some of the vents on the Switch. Although these vents are not visible when the Flip Grip is installed, air is still flowing through them. The Flip Grip doesn\u2019t come anywhere close to creating an airtight seal around your console; there are slits and clearances that allow air to enter in and out of the necessary vents.\nTo prove this in practice, we\u2019ve run extensive tests that show that there are no appreciable differences in temperature when the Flip Grip is installed, even when running intensive games like Breath of the Wild.\nTo put you even more at ease, the simple reality is that Nintendo designed Switch to use less power while in handheld mode\u2026 and less power usage means lower temperatures. Even high-impact games like Breath of the Wild don't generate enough heat during play to bring the system's internal temperature anywhere near its limits. The Switch only operates at full power when docked, and it's physically impossible to dock your system while using Flip Grip.\nWe've also shared the Flip Grip with quite a few developers and publishers, and none of them have expressed concern about this feature.\nMaintaining airflow through the vents is something we\u2019ve been very mindful of from our first prototype, and we feel obligated to tell you exactly what we\u2019ve learned and let you draw your own conclusions. Although our extensive testing has made us confident the Flip Grip is completely safe to use, we take no responsibility in the unlikely event that your Switch is damaged or malfunctions while you\u2019re using the Flip Grip.\nOrientation Compatibility\nOh, and one other small concern: While Flip Grip works perfectly now with dozens of games, there are one or two titles that only support 90-degree rotation in the opposite direction of Flip Grip's orientation. D'oh! Hopefully Flip Grip will turn out to be such a huge success that those developers will patch in a reverse orientation option\u2026\n The Flip Grip project is a work of genuine passion from people who love classic games, who love handheld games, and who love the Switch. We\u2019re also excited to see how the Flip Grip enables developers to release new vertical-mode experiences for the Switch.  \nWe're not out to make a huge profit from this campaign \u2014 we simply want to make Flip Grip a reality and get it into as many people's hands as possible. There's never been a console better suited to putting perfect arcade recreations in your hands, and we want to play a part in bringing those experiences to you.\nThank you!\n___\nIn order fulfill your backer rewards, personal data will be transferred from Kickstarter to Fangamer, both US companies, and used in accordance with Fangamer\u2019s Privacy Policy.\nFinal product may differ from renders and illustrations shown above.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSee above section for Risks and Challenges.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 12 or more", "title": "Flip Grip", "descp": "Get one (1) Flip Grip, the perfect accessory for portable vertical-mode gaming on the Switch.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["7,041 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 24 or more", "title": "Flip Grips", "descp": "Get two (2) Flip Grips and save on shipping.\nPerfect for multiplayer vertical-mode play for you and a friend!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,191 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #11", "update_userinfo": "Haven't received your order yet?", "update_content": "If you have not received your Flip Grip or have any other related questions, please e-mail orders@fangamer.com and we will have the issue resolved as soon as we can.

To win, you must keep every member of the team alive - if any player is killed the game ends immediately!\nAfter our first campaign in 2017, we released Escape the Dark Castle along with the first expansion, Adventure Pack 1: Cult of the Death Knight.

You'll get two copies of the card - one to use and one to keep pristine or frame as a rare collectors item. \nOur \u00a325k funding goal will cover the print run and associated logistical costs of this ambitious campaign. But, if we are fortunate enough to exceed that goal we'd like to offer you the following freebies and upgrades: \n(All stretch goal targets are in \u00a3 GBP)\nAt this level of funding, all backers will get the Escape the Dark Castle Original Soundtrack MP3 files to download free of charge. \nAt this level of funding, all backers will get the new and improved Tales from the Dark book PDF file to download free of charge. \nAt this level of funding, all backers will get The Death Book PDF file to download free of charge.\nNaturally, the sleeves will be high quality regardless, but what we\u2019d really love to do is upgrade them from the standard material to a matt finish. \nOur books will be a classy production, but if we reach this level of funding it will open up some more luxurious options and finishes to make the print editions of Both Tales from the Dark and The Death Book that little bit more special. \n At this level of funding we'd like to replace the Health Tracker cubes in the Collector's Box with something more thematic. Little skulls perhaps...\nThe Collectors Box includes a 'first player' card we refer to as the 'torch'. Given the chance, we'd like to upgrade this to an object as standard. \nIf you thought the Golden Axe was legendary, wait until you see what is perhaps the most influential relic the gaming world has even known - The Living Stone! We'll add this item card and its custom dice to the Collector's Box as standard. \nEscape the Dark Castle lends itself well to a tasteful companion app, to track health and play the soundtrack to augment the play experience. This will be free to all backers if we reach this level of funding, but may not deliver at the same time as the other items in this campaign. \nWe can dream. While the best way to experience Escape the Dark Castle will always be on the tabletop, we can't deny the idea of making a digital version has massive appeal. This will be free to all backers if we reach this level of funding, but may not deliver at the same time as the other items in this campaign.\nAfter an impeccable performance handling our first campaign, we'll once again be working with our expert fulfillment partner Gamesquest to make sure your game is delivered promptly and with expert care.  \nWe are EU, USA, and AU friendly, ensuring backers in these locations will pay no extra customs charges beyond the shipping cost itself.\nPlease note: For deliveries outside of these locations, check the rules and regulations on importing goods to your region before you pledge.  \nThe following base level shipping costs will be charged based on your location and pledge level:\nPlease note: Ordering add-ons may increase your shipping charge above the price shown below.

IT TOOK LONG ENOUGH FOR WALUIGI TO GET HIS OWN BOOK. IT CONTAINS ALL THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT WALUIGI.\"\nEven the things we'd rather not know...?\n\"ESPECIALLY THOSE!\"\n\"WALUIGI FEELS PHILOSOPHICAL TODAY. WHAT IS WALUIGI? WHY IS WALUIGI?\"\nThis twisted take on that beloved blighter Waluigi began with my gaming parody webcomic, Brawl in the Family. Waluigi occasionally \"took over\" the web page, supplying his own bizarre comics and japes for a brief time (usually on April Fools Day). Although BitF ended in 2014, Waluigi apparently lives on, having now created an entire book dedicated to his tomfoolery.\nMake no mistake either--\"TOO BAD. WALUIGI TIME\" isn't a compilation of past comics, but a hardcover tome full of new content. We're talking 200 brand, spanking new strips, plus the original set of 50 (or so) Waluigi comics from the BitF days for context.\nThe new strips will mostly center around Waluigi having brand new adventures and experiencing life in that uniquely inscrutable way. Waluigi's world seems to be a bizarre amalgam of modern life and the Mushroom Kingdom. He'll fly a kite, sit on a guy, attempt to make eggs, take up a job at the DMV, study Japanese, sing karaoke, invade a variety of classic animated films, and that's just for starters.\nIn addition, there are several brand new multi-comic story arcs for those days when one shot of Waluigi just isn't enough...\nThere's even an ending sequence wrapping everything up, with a few surprises along the way! For instance, the art may subtly evolve as the book progresses and Waluigi's skill improves. While the comics are mostly one-offs and small storylines, there's going to be a narrative incorporated into it all to really make the book stand on its own as a story.\nIt doesn't stop there. Waluigi gets lazy from time to time so the comic-drawing duties may be passed onto his buddy Wario, who possesses a similarly obtuse sense of humor. Wario's a bit more cheerful yet juvenile, so his take on things can lead to interesti--\nWait, what's this? It appears the crew from Brawl in the Family has pulled a little April Fools prank themselves and planned for some revenge! That's right, it's a little BitF bonus takeover, square in the middle of Waluigi's own book: \"Back in the Family!\" Between fifteen and twenty brand new Brawl in the Family-style comics will be included! Here's a Star Allies-themed one:\nOn top of all that, you can expect the same level of polish that Brawl in the Family: Volumes One, Two and Three had, with included Characters pages, Comic Directories, Special Thanks (with a twist!) and more.\n\"WAIT, THESE COINS AREN'T JUST GOING INTO WALUIGI'S POCKET? YOU ARE A TERRIBLE BUSINESSMAN.\"\nThe $25,000 goal breaks down as such--\n$8,000 minimum for the book's physical creation\n$7,000 for taxes\n$3,000 for shipping costs\n$2,500 for initial Kickstarter and credit card fees\nThat leaves about $4,500 for the artist to conceptualize and draw up the entire book. But I wouldn't complain if we got more, and that's what the Stretch Goals are for!\n \"THE GIFT OF WALUIGI SHOULD BE PLENTY ALREADY!\"\nWaluigi may be a bitter blighter, but he takes care of his fans. If you can convert your love for Waluigi into a dollar amount, you'll be sure to find some purple rewards fit for royalty.\nIf you just want the basics, $15 will net you all the content but none of the atoms, with the digital book! $39 is the most affordable, direct way to get the book itself with no strings attached.\nAt $54, your book will contain a signature and sketch from some guy named Matthew Taranto, while the $74 tier grants you a permanent spot in everyone's books in the Special Thanks section! And this Thanks is even more Special than before--it's actually a part of the book's narrative!\nThere are two tiers that double your Waluigi pleasure with two copies of the book: $77 for just the books, or $144 for both with a pair of signature/sketches and Special Thanks names!\nIf you're the type that dons eggplant-colored overalls every weekend, you won't want to miss out on the top tiers: $94 delivers all of the above, plus your very own fan-art of Waluigi will be featured in all copies of the book! And finally, at $299, that fan-art will get its own unique page in every book, AND a full in-book critique by Waluigi himself!\nAnd don't worry if you don't draw much--Waluigi's tastes are refined to the point where he can appreciate even the most Dada-esque attempts at capturing his glorious visage. But I can't promise he won't be...y'know, devastating.\n\"WALUIGI IS READY TO GO ALL OUT WITH THIS BOOK. IT WILL MAKE THE BRAWL IN THE FAMILY BOOKS LOOK LIKE HUMORLESS GARBAGE. WAAAHAHAHA!!\"\nTimepiece 1 Cleared: GOAL REACHED\nThe initial goal is $25,000, and we reached it in less than three days. Huzzah! Now this vile, eggplant-colored Tome of Eternal Darkness will become a reality thanks to you fantastic fans. Clear up some space on your shelf, because the rest of your books won't want to be anywhere near this thing!\nTimepiece 2 Cleared: BONUS ART PIECES\nThis stretch goal will graft several new pages right into the book, each one adorned with a full-color new image of Waluigi in a particular style. Ever wanted to see Waluigi drawn in the style of Final Fantasy's Yoshitaka Amano, Garfield's Jim Davis or The Simpsons' Matt Groening? ...No? Well, you will anyway with this tier, so prepare those eyeballs!\nTimepiece 3 Cleared: QUALITY BOOST\nThe now-classic Quality Boost stretch goal will spiffy up the books to the same degree as the past Brawl in the Family volumes. That means 1) heavier, higher-quality paper, 2) a shiny, foil title on the cover, 3) new inside cover art, and 4) stronger book binding to ensure if can take a beating. In short, the book gets stronger and prettier from this level-up.\nTimepiece 4: NEW WALUIGI SONG\nIf you're the type that listened to A Wallelujah Chorus on repeat all month, Q-Tip those ears, because we've got more glorious Waluigi music coming your way. Hitting this goal means a new musical Waluigi cover will hit YouTube sometime soon for all to enjoy!\nTimepiece 5: MORE BACK IN THE FAMILY COMICS\nGet ready for a little extra splash of blue! If reached, this goal will add more brand new \"Back in the Family\" comics to the book, bringing the total number of them to a solid 30! I'll have to work overtime to come up with what's essentially 2 full months of BitF, but at 60k, I'm certainly willing to do that. While Waluigi is less-enthused about this goal, that's fine--he's got the rest of the book to himself already.\nTimepiece 6: ANOTHER NEW WALUIGI SONG\nMini-rewards means many rewards! As part of our \"last week\" promotion, the Stretch Goals have gone into overdrive with bonuses every $5,000! 65k is no exception, prepping a second new Waluigi song for everyone.\nTimepiece 7: A THIRD NEW WALUIGI SONG\nThe hits just keep on coming! A third Waluigi musical cover will show up prior to the book's release if this goal is reached, bringing the grand total of Waluigi songs on BitFinity's YouTube to five. That's one for every weekday to listen to for the rest of your life!\nTimepiece 8: ALL SMASH CHARACTERS WALUIGI-FIED\nRemember how BitF Volume One contained that large, double-page art of all the Super Smash Bros. Brawl characters? This would be kinda like that...but weirder. It's my attempt to \"Waluigi-fy\" every member of the cast, from Alph to Zero Suit Samus! Note that this doesn't mean every character will be sporting a long nose and spindly mustache, but rather that they'll each have very exaggerated, offbeat features like Waluigi. It's sure to be one of the most bizarre things seen by mankind, so let's make it happen!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf funded, I'll aim to make this new book match the quality of my past comic books: Brawl in the Family: Volumes One, Two and Three, so that fans can have something to be proud of on their bookshelves.

My name is Miss Muju, and I'm an artist based in St Ives, Cornwall, UK.  My partner and I set up the Muju Studio here 8 years ago, as a studio by the beach seemed like a good plan!  We are both artists, with a shared love of nature, photography, travel, and most of all creating immersive worlds.  \nMr Muju produces drawings, paintings and prints of an imaginary dimension - Mujuworld.   \nI take inspiration from this world and bring the characters to life through sculptures. \nI've been producing limited edition resin figures for the past 7 years, and I'm committed to self-producing all my work, using sustainable materials wherever possible.  \n\nWith your help over the years I've been able to release some classic Muju characters, including the Tree Spirit and the Star Traveller.  It's been an amazing creative journey since my first KickStarter in 2013, and now I'm back with my latest creations to share with you!\nYou can see more of our work on our website : www.mujuworld.co.uk \nMiss Muju sculpting\nMujuworld has always been a place full of buildings and landscapes that are as alive as the Muju characters which inhabit the world. \nMujuworld illustrations\nThe idea of bringing some of the Muju architecture to life in 3D has been in the background for a long time, with Mr Muju often asking me to make him a building or two for his desk.\nI finally got around to sculpting one, and found myself instantly in love with mini architecture. One design then became five Muju Spirit Houses, and as I couldn't stop there, the next step had to be sculpting a Muju Temple.\nMuju Spirit House sculpts ready for moulding\nThe Forest Temple is my most ambitious and complex sculpture to date, and includes details like the temple guardian cat, some standing stones, and a tiny cosmic owl perched on the temple treetop.   \nAfter many months of pre-production work, I'm finally ready to share these new sculptures with you. \nMuju Forest Temple Sculpture\nThis project is well underway, as we've already produced the original sculptures, and have one working mould for each design.  Using these moulds we have created the prototypes featured in our KickStarter film.  But now we need to invest in an in-house production run of these sculptures.\nThe pre-production costs involved in releasing a new sculpture are high. We cast our sculptures in bio-resin, which is a non-toxic and more sustainable material than traditional resin. However it's significantly more expensive than polyurethane resin. Bio-resin is also a harder material to work with than standard resin, and takes much longer to set, only allowing one cast per day.  So more moulds need to be made of each sculpture to increase our daily casting rate.\nThis project requires more investment than previous sculptures I've released, as I am hoping to create my first ever Muju mini series to accompany the Forest Temple sculpture.  This will involve producing multiple moulds for every Spirit House as well as the Forest Temple to enable us to increase our production rate.  \nEach Forest Temple and Spirit House sculpture is totally handmade and hand-painted by ourselves, which also requires a big investment of our time.\n\nPre-order sales through this KickStarter campaign will enable us to fund a production run of this handmade sculpture series.\nMuju Postcard Set\nThe first reward tier is for a set of 3 Muju postcards. \nThese postcards feature all 3 main elements of this Kickstarter campaign... The Forest Temple, the Spirit House illustration, and the Spirit House sculptures. \n\nYou will also get access to all our backer updates throughout the campaign and beyond, so you can follow our progress from start to finish :)\nMuju Spirit House Enamel Pin Design\nThe second reward tier is for a Muju Spirit House enamel pin badge    \nSize: 3.5cm (1.4\") tall\nMuju Happy Hills\nThe Happy Hills reward will get you a pair of mini happy hill sculptures - one in each design.  The hills stand 2cm tall and will come in a random selection of colours.  See below for some example pairs: \nExamples of the 2 x Happy Hill rewards\nMuju Spirit Houses - Limited Edition Print\nWith this reward tier you will receive one 'Muju Spirit House' gicl\u00e9e fine art limited edition print.  Signed and numbered by Mr Muju.\nPrint size: 30 x 21cm (11.7 x 8.3\") \nEdition size: 50\nMuju Spirit Houses\nSpirit House reward tiers:\nThe Spirit House sculptures stand between 5-6cm tall ( approx. 2\").  Each one is hand cast and painted by us in the Muju Studio.\nThere are multiple reward tiers for the Spirit Houses. You can chose from one Spirit House, up to all five.  However many you decide to pledge for, you will be able to pick which designs you would like.  We will send out a backer survey after the Kickstarter has ended, and ask you to choose your Spirit Houses then :)\nSpirit House 1\nSpirit House 2\nSpirit House 3\nSpirit House 4\nSpirit House 5\nMuju Forest Temple Sculpture\nMuju Forest Temple reward tier:\nReceive one Forest Temple sculpture, which stands 18cm tall ( approx. 7\").\nEach sculpture is individually hand cast, finished and painted by us in the Muju Studio.  \nForest Temple Sculpture Details\nThis reward tier is for the Forest Temple complete set !\nThis set will include:\n- 2 x Happy Hill mini sculptures\n- 3 x Muju Postcards\n- 1 x Muju Spirit House Ltd edition print\n- 5 x Spirit Houses (1 of each design )\n- 1 x Forest Temple sculpture\nThe Cosmic Owl on the Forest Temple treetop\nThe Forest Temple Collection\nThe final reward is for a one-off Forest Temple collection, encased in a glass dome display stand. \nEach Spirit House sculpture in this scene sits atop its own Happy Hill. \nThe Forest Temple is a one-of-a-kind version which has been sculpted to stand 22cm tall (9\") tall.\nThe glass dome display stands 27cm tall and 14cm diameter (11 x 5.5\").\nForest Temple scene details\nA look inside the glass display dome\nIf you want to add-on any extras to your chosen reward you can! \nHow do I do that? \nYou can adjust your pledge amount at any point to add extras to your reward options. Simply click the \"manage your pledge\" button here on the page, and then you can increase your pledge by the desired amount, without having to change your selected reward tier. \nHere's some example options:\nAdd \u00a38 to your pledge = receive a Spirit House enamel pin badge (as well as your chosen reward) \nAdd \u00a315 = receive 2 mini Happy Hills with your selected reward tier\nAdd \u00a320 = receive a Muju Print with your reward.\nAdd \u00a325 = Get an extra Spirit House of your choice \nAfter the campaign ends I will send out a survey to each backer to finalise what you want to add-on.  This will make sure you get exactly what you pledged for.\nIf you have any questions about add-on options you can message me for more details!\n\nThanks for taking the time to check out this KickStarter campaign.

We have already reached the stage in production where the original sculpts are complete, and we have made the first silicone mould for each design featured in this campaign.\n\nWe have set realistic goals for the production times of the different rewards in this KickStarter. We will also vary the delivery dates on the rewards to allow us time to fulfil all the reward pledges within a reasonable time frame.\n\nWe will also keep all our backers updated with the production process so they know when to expect their rewards to arrive. \n\nWith your help we are ready to bring these sculptures to life :)\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a33 or more", "title": "Muju Postcard Set", "descp": "Receive 3 Muju postcards -

Make your way through thick forests, narrow trails and wild rivers. Race, jump, slide and try not to crash - all the way from the peak to the valley!\nLonely Mountains: Downhill is planned for release on PC/Mac/Linux mid-2018 if we hit our funding goal.\nJoin us for behind-the-scene news!Discord | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Newsletter \n            When we started the development of Lonely Mountains: Downhill two years ago we knew that we wanted to create a different kind of sports game. \nInspired by videos from Danny MacAskill or Kenny Belaey (just to name a few) we went on a journey to create a mountain biking game in which the mountain is your only opponent and nature your only companion. \nSet in a world without sponsor signs, barrier tapes or spectators we want you to feel like the first rider to ever challenge this mountain - to explore its wild landscapes and to find your own path down the trail.\nOur gameplay vision was to create a fun game - not a replica of real downhill biking. After lots of prototyping we ended up with controls and a camera system that we believe offer a very cool arcade-like racing experience. \nWe wanted to keep it simple: you can steer, accelerate, brake and sprint. We handle jumping and sliding through our custom bike physics system so there are no extra buttons required.\nWe also strived to make a game that you can simply enjoy as a pastime while still offering serious challenge for speedrunners, competitive players or gamers looking for a tough but fair experience.\nLonely Mountains: Downhill is not an easy game. You will crash and you'll crash a lot - but you can instantly restart at the last checkpoint (which is never too far behind) and due to our rag-doll system crashing is actually quite fun - especially for the people watching you crash.\nThere is no better way to explain the game than just watching these fine folks play the Gamescom Showcase (Thanks to Motoagogo 13, Starsnipe, and Bonnie Kiwi)\nThe game will feature numerous mountains - all of them handcrafted. Each consists of several sections connected seamlessly with multiple paths to the next checkpoint.\nOur goal is to allow you to play the game the way you want to. You can choose to take a relaxing ride on the scenic route, go off-road to find hidden locations and secrets, or you can go into \"full speedrun mode\" - trying to make that one nearly impossible jump over the canyon for the all-time record.\nThere's a special bond between a rider and her or his bike. Not every bike is the best fit for every rider or every mountain. That\u2019s why in the course of the game you will be able to unlock new bikes with different gameplay values, so that you can always choose the best bike for the trail ahead.\nWe also know that everyone has a personal taste when it comes to cool looking bikes. Therefore each bike will have a large variety of different skins you can find or unlock.\nNature plays a huge role in our game. You'll find no barriers or sponsor signs on the side of the road. No audience cheering you on and no winner's podium waiting for you at the finish line. It's just you and the mountain.\nOur goal with the visual as well as the audio design is to make the environment in the game come to life. Trees are swaying in the wind, butterflies travel between the flowers and you can discover all kinds of birds and animals as you ride.\nReady to see the world? The base version of the game will feature six different lonely mountains which are inspired by real life mountainscapes and locations all around the globe.\nDuring the game you will unlock new game modes and each will have its own leaderboard. There will be two different time trial modes, a special challenge mode as well as a \"One Life\"- mode which will only be for the toughest of riders!\nWe want to support the following languages: English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, Polish, Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Korean.\nIf you want to help us localize the game or - even more important at the moment - this Kickstarter page please don't hesitate to contact us at localization@lonelymountains.com. We really appreciate any help we can get! \nOverview\nAdditional Information \nDollar Prices: these have been calculated on the 11th of October 2017 and might change slightly during the campaign based on the exchange rate between Euro and Dollar. \nDesign A Paint Job: We will send you a template which you can color and then we create a paint job based on your design. Please note we can't put logos or texts on the bike.\nUnique Bike and Rider: We'll design a bike and outfit in the game\u2019s style based on images you provide. After release you will receive an in game redeemable code to unlock the bike and outfit. The code can be used as often as you like and you can share it with your friends.\nWe started Lonely Mountains: Downhill two years ago and now have the game in a state where all the core gameplay features are there. The art, UI and audio direction are also set and most of the tools are tested and ready to use.\nWe\u2019ve also had nearly a thousand players playtest the game at different events. The feedback has been very good and we're pretty confident that the core gameplay is a lot of fun.\nWe feel that the game is now at a point where we know what game we want to make and can now ramp up the production to build the actual game content.\nWe founded Megagon Industries in 2013. Our initial goal was to have a shared company to publish our private pet projects but since then the company has grown into much more than that:\nWe released two premium mobile games: \u201c... and then it rained\u201d and \u201cTwisted Lines\u201d. The later was nominated for the German game developer awards, the German video game awards as well as selected for several showcases. This encouraged us to spend more and more time working on our games until we decided to work full-time on Lonely Mountains: Downhill.\nHi, I\u2019m Jan. Ever since I was a kid I truly loved riding a bike - whether it was racing down a hill against my friends or riding for a week along the Baltic Sea. Sitting on my bike makes me happy. \nMy first steps in creating digital stuff reach back almost 25 years ago. Although \u201ccoding\u201d back then was more putting together some keywords in QBasic to see what happens.\nLater on when level editors became more common I created maps for games like C&C, Doom and Half Life and got fascinated by 3D graphics.\nMy diploma thesis introduced me to Unity and since then I worked as a freelancing programmer on many different Unity projects. One of them lead me to a company called Die Hobrechts in 2011 where I met Daniel.\nHey! I'm Daniel. I started creating levels for Unreal Tournament when I was 16 and I\u2019ve been making games ever since.\nAfter graduating as a Game Designer in 2008 I worked at Keen Games and remote control productions before I became a freelancer in 2010.\nIn 2011 I co-founded a game design agency called Die Hobrechts with some friends which became the place I met Jan for the first time. We're working together ever since and founded Megagon Industries together in 2013. \nAlthough Kickstarter comes with a lot of risks it feels like the right step for us - for more than one reason:\nEarly access: We got asked a lot if there's some way to play the game before its official release. We think a Kickstarter campaign with different early access tiers is the best way to offer that.\nDeveloping the game together: We hope that a Kickstarter campaign can be the start of a community who helps us shape and improve the game.\nCreative independence: It\u2019s important for us to stay creatively independent and make decisions we think are best for the game.\nWe need the money: We were fortunate enough to receive state funding by the Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg. However, this funding will only cover half of the development costs as we need to provide the other half. If we are able to reach our initial funding goal we can make the base version of the game together with you and Medienboard.\nSo what\u2019s happening with the Kickstarter money?\nAfter taxes, Kickstarter & payment processing fees 71% of the Kickstarter money will be used to pay for the development of the game together with the Medienboard funding.\nDevelopment costs include Jan\u2019s and Daniel\u2019s salaries as well as salaries for freelancers helping with sound design and additional 3D assets and animations.\nWe also have to pay office rent, accounting, software licenses and all the other stuff necessary to run a game development studio - even when it\u2019s as small as ours. \nWe know Kickstarter will be a tough ride. We saw a lot of very good projects who didn\u2019t or just barely succeeded. We both thought long and hard about the risks of doing this but seeing all the amazing feedback over the last few months we decided to try it anyway. We believe that together with you we can climb that mountain! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019re probably not alone with saying that making games is nearly always a risky endeavour. We\u2019ve never worked on a game which didn\u2019t hit some unexpected problems somewhere down the road and Lonely Mountains: Downhill will probably not be the exception. With that said we already have a fun and playable core game so we\u2019re hopeful we can tackle most of what the game development gods might throw at us.\n\nIn addition there are only two of us at the moment, and for such a small team certain risks are bound to be present. If one of us gets ill or has to take time out for their personal life, it is extremely likely to affect the development roadmap.\n\nLastly- one of the reasons we decided to go with a Kickstarter rather than working with a publisher is the freedom to keep experimenting and prototyping. If we have to choose between a new great idea for the game or an earlier release, going for the idea will probably win most of the times.\n\nAs for the Kickstarter rewards fulfillment: because we decided to only have very few physical rewards we\u2019re confident that all backers will get their rewards once they become available.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "PLANT A TREE", "descp": "Thank you for your support!

Sign up there to receive alerts on any reprints or expansions for Forest of Fate, plus news on all our upcoming storytelling games!\nFacebook | Twitter | BGG | Email\nTop reasons to play Forest of Fate\nIf you grew up with Choose Your Own Adventure or Fighting Fantasy, Forest of Fate evokes that nostalgic feeling and lets you share it in a fun cooperative format with your friends and family - and it's (mostly) kid-friendly!\nIf you like the storytelling element of games like Tales of the Arabian Nights or Above & Below, you will love the tighter, faster, easier to learn gameplay of Forest of Fate\nIf you've been tempted by RPGs like Dungeons & Dragons, but haven't been able to find a group (or the courage to join one), Forest of Fate could be your gateway into the hobby - and it's much easier to introduce to your non-gaming friends!\nIf you're in an existing RPG group, Forest of Fate could be your next warm-up game, with its short run time and flexible player count.\nRead John's full preview here.\nThe response to Forest of Fate has so far been staggering. As a result, you've unlocked every stretch goal I could throw at you. The game is now bigger and better than I could have imagined. Thank you!\nRead Bod's full review here.\nI was inspired to create Forest of Fate by the gamebooks of my childhood, the worlds of J.R.R. Tolkein and Terry Pratchett, and the amazing and varied scenery near my home on the South West coast of England.\nMy goal was to make roleplaying games more accessible by stripping back almost all the conventional elements, revealing a strong procedural storytelling experience that is:\nEasy to grasp and \"safe\" for new players\nSelf-contained, and quick to play\nEndlessly replayable\nI hope I've succeeded!\nForest of Fate uses nothing but a storybook and high-quality cards for its unique brand of survival storytelling. It's compact enough to take anywhere, and has no small parts to lose!\nCheck out some of the gorgeous character art by the brilliant Milly Hanson:\nThe Thief\nThe Bard\nThe Ranger\nThe Warrior\nHere's a simplified interaction between a Character and an Encounter, to demonstrate the anatomy of the most important cards.\nThe Story Book is the heart and soul of Forest of Fate. It contains 1,164 paragraphs to spark your imagination, describing the encounters you'll face and the actions you'll take.\nA computer rendering of the Deluxe Story Book (Hero tier and above)\nYou have three choices when it comes to using the Story Book:\nThe content and gameplay for all three versions is identical, though I recommend the digital version - it can be updated later if we spot mistakes, and more importantly helps to save the forests we love!\nI've tried to make all rewards simple and fair. Please note that this campaign will not be using a pledge manager. Once it's over, it's over. If you've got your eye on something you should grab it while you can!\nForest of Fate is the debut game from Cards of Fate. As a startup publisher without a great deal of capital to invest or a name in the industry, I view Kickstarter as an exciting opportunity to help build a small community around my games and reward those who share my vision.\nPlaytesting (all components pictured are early prototypes, not final)\nThank you for reading, and I hope I've inspired you to try Forest of Fate.\nThanks also to the fine folk at Tabletop Audio for the ambient forest sounds used in my videos. They're highly recommended if you want to really immerse yourself in the game!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThough this is my first Kickstarter, as a professional Project Manager I understand risk and have taken all steps necessary to ensure the successful delivery of your rewards.\n\n-- Design & Content\nThe only elements of the game outstanding at this stage are the naming rights made available as rewards and the finalised stretch goal content. All other content is complete and all designs have been finalised and formatted, ready for manufacturing.\n\n-- Manufacturing\nForest of Fate uses standard components, and will be printed and packaged by a proven Chinese board and card game manufacturer. All components will be subject to a thorough review by Cards of Fate prior to mass production.\n\n-- Shipping\nFulfilment will be handled by Gamesquest, a well-known and experienced partner in Kickstarted board games. Backers with the EU will have their rewards sent from within the EU, so there should be no additional VAT or customs charges.\n\n-- Stretch Goals\nAll stretch goals have been carefully pre-planned and pre-budgeted.

The majority of funds go directly toward creating Mine! and shipping them out. In accordance with Kickstarter's guidelines, pledges cannot directly go to Planned Parenthood, but proceeds from the book sales can and will be.\nSo where is your money going? As with any project, there are fixed costs (costs that are not going to change whether you make one unit or a million units) and variable costs (the costs involved in producing each individual unit going forward).  \nFixed costs include things like legal fees, advertising, printing production costs, and creation of the contents of the book\u2014 writing, artwork, lettering, coloring, and so on. \n$27,000 - Creation costs for 180 pages of amazing content. \n$ 3,000 - Legal and Administrative costs  \n\"But wait! Aren\u2019t the creators donating their work?\" Yes, many of them are indeed donating their work, but not everybody is doing so. That\u2019s not a slam against them, comics is a business and they\u2019re working\u2014 indeed, we know they\u2019re taking a pay cut to work on this book rather than a better paying project. The only drawback is that we don\u2019t know yet how many creators are donating their fees back to the project, so we\u2019re using the maximum we\u2019re paying per page, so we know that even if everyone takes their full fees, we\u2019re still going to raise enough money to complete the project. Variable costs for this book include Kickstarter\u2019s fees, credit card and PayPal fees, and the costs to print or produce each and every reward. \n 5% - Kickstarter fees \n3% - Credit card/Paypal fees \n25% - Printing & producing rewards \n2% - Packing and handling \n Money raised that\u2019s above and beyond those variable costs will pay to cover fixed costs, and what remains will be used for marketing, distribution, and lowering wholesale prices to make Mine! available to more people.\nKickstarter offers us a tremendous platform and a wide audience to make this all possible. The proceeds from sales of this anthology post-campaign will support Planned Parenthood. By offering creators a page rate they can donate, we will be able to boost our support for PP in addition to sales from the book to make Mine! a success for PP and all of us for years to come!\nStory by Michael Moreci and Danny Luckert\n  Over 40 stories is a great start but we don't want to stop there. Help us reach past our goal and we'll push Mine! further, giving you more stories, a Spanish language version, a hardcover edition, and shipping more copies to libraries and politicians for your pledge.\nComicMix stands with Planned Parenthood and all the work they do, and is creating Mine! as a benefit book that will inform and also raise money for Planned Parenthood. ComicMix has obtained a trademark agreement with Planned Parenthood and has coordinated with them on some of the stories you will find in this book.\nIt is important to acknowledge all the incredible services that Planned Parenthood provides and how those who do not personally support reproductive rights should want to fight to protect. However, ComicMix and Mine! support reproductive rights.\nBy Leah Garrett, Barbara Haspiel and Dean Haspiel\n   Take a look at this brief explanation..\n  Thank you from all of us at ComicMix: Mike Gold, Glenn Hauman , Martha Thomases , Adriane Nash, Evelyn Kriete, Molly Jackson , Joe Corallo and the rest of the team.

Your species rely on food from the watering hole to survive. Want to eat the plant food before your opponents get the chance? Add the Foraging trait to eat food twice as fast. Think a Carnivore is lurking? Evolve with Climbing and escape to the trees, or better yet, evolve your species into a Carnivore and make a meal of your opponents.\nWith a deck of beautiful watercolor trait cards from internationally renowned nature artist Catherine Hamilton, the endless combinations turn every game into a thrilling adventure.\nThe \"Horns\" trait\nThe \"Carnivore\" trait\nThe Evolution video game is coming to your device this Fall. Our growing team of accomplished video game developers has been refining Evolution for several years now. Over 1,000 people played the Alpha Version this Summer. Here is some of the raw feedback they volunteered: (read more at the bottom of the page):\n Man Vs Meeple\n AppAddict\nOur team has worked the last two and a half years to ensure North Star Games\u2019 first video game will make some waves. We\u2019ve already built the core game elements and will release the single player beta on PC/Mac the day after this Kickstarter campaign ends. But there are other features we want to include for the final release which we can't polish without a robust community of Beta players: \nUnique AI opponents that deploy distinct strategies and compete at an expert level. \nA cross-platform multiplayer system to instantly match you up with an opponent of similar skill-level. \nEngaging campaign challenges to keep the Evolution experience fresh. \nBy adjusting the traits, rules, and card balance, we can drastically change the balance of the ecosystem. To help build the strong player base we need, we've added some exceptional perks for those who back the Kickstarter now instead of waiting for the release. See the Bonus Stretch Goals. Our goal is to make a game you can\u2019t stop playing. So clear out your October - Evolution is coming!\nThe soundtrack and sound effects for Evolution will be composed and produced by North Star Digital\u2019s audio director, Island Styles. \nHailing from Alexandria, VA, Island Styles is a composer and touring musician. Although he has a strong musical background rooted in rock'n'roll (as a guitarist for rock bands Candlebox and Jimmie's Chicken Shack), he enjoys creating all styles of music. Composing for video games like Evolution offer him a unique medium to exercise that musical diversity.\nHere's the Evolution Trailer track:\nAbout North Star Games  \nSince 2003, North Star Games has been making board games that are simple to learn and give endless hours of exciting play. Our award-winning blockbusters include Wits & Wagers, Say Anything, Happy Salmon, and Evolution. Total sales of these 4 brands are nearing 3 million copies.\nWe launched the North Star Digital studio three years ago so we could control the quality of our brands on digital platforms. Since then, we have built a team of video game development experts and will soon release a fresh, standalone experience with the Evolution video game.\n *Shipping Worldwide does not include Russia, Brazil, South Africa and North Korea due to shipping distributor restrictions.\nWe had approximately 1,000 random people alpha test the video game throughout this Summer. Here is some of the raw feedback we received:\n\u201cI am a science teacher. When I showed my class the demo of the video game they flipped out! You won over my class!\u201d - ThorTiberius\n\"Loved the digital version of Evolution:)! Great graphics and animations! Smooth game play. I was sooo sad when my Alpha-testing period was over.\" -Verity Hitchings  \n\u201cI was shocked at how well evolution was transformed from a board game to a video game, the bar has been raised quite notably.\u201d - Graham Lynch\n\u201cEasy to get into, yet difficult to master. A challenging, vicious AI opponent will put your nerves to the test. The alpha was already a visual marvel. Can't wait for the finished version.\u201d - Franky Lanckacker \n\u201cAbsolutely amazing digital conversion. I learned to play Evolution with the digital version and now I just bought a copy of the physical game. I feel the same about the Video Game as the physical version...awesome.\u201d - Gonzalo Casas   \n\u201cAs a board game geek, I'm very critical of ports from the physical to the digital. The Evolution video game has really made the grade: intuitive design, fun aesthetics and being faithful to the game rules and spirit. I highly recommend it!\u201d - Dane Anker   \n\u201cEvolution is my new go-to example for how a board game should make the jump to screens.\u201d - Ian Parmenter \u201cWhen i got a chance to play it on pc i lost my mind at how well the developers created it. The artwork and the gameplay was amazing. It's easy to learn and so addictive you won't be able to stop playing.\u201d - Jacob Dupra\n\u201cThis is a beautiful-in-every-way implementation of a great game.\u201d - Ron Parker    \n\u201cEvolution has finally cracked the code! Fun, gorgeous, interactive \u2026 it\u2019s smart and it\u2019s easy all at once!\u201d - Russell P. Smith \n\u201cOne of the best digital implementations of a tabletop game to date. I especially loved all the different strategies you could explore while playing the AI opponents in such a short amount of time.\u201d - Ryan Malone   \n\u201cI tried out the demo for this game at Pax East. It was pretty good then, but by the alpha test, it had \"evolved\", becoming something even more amazing! I ended up playing for hours on end, and I cannot wait to get back to playing it.\u201d - Deirdre Lannelli   \n\"One of those rare cases of a game making the jump from tabletop to digital -- and landing a perfect ten.\u201d - Doc Jones   \n\u201cWhen the Alpha test for the Evolution video game was over, I suddenly became aware that I had to go cold turkey. I mean, I had been playing every day. Then, nothing. So.... yeah. Apparently, I'm hooked.\u201d - Jeff Hesse   \n\"Evolution offers plenty of depth without sacrificing fun. The digital adaptation's streamlined interface makes it a strong contender for best digital board game adaptation.\u201d - Anthony P   \n\u201cMy wife and I have been playing Evolution since the first Kickstarter campaign. It wasn't until the digital port, however, that we were able to adequately explain the game to our kids. Of course, now they now routinely beat us in the tabletop version. Come to think of it... this was a terrible idea.\u201d - Marcus Howell    \n\u201cYou'll have to pardon the pun, because this game was Intelligently Designed.The art and gameplay simply couldn't be better.\u201d - Bryant B\n\u201cIncredibly polished game play. Nice animations without detracting from the game and helpful info tips.\u201d - BlueSapphyre \n\u201cIt faithfully recreates the experience of playing Evolution, but is far more portable. If that doesn't sell this product to you then you need to spend more time playing Evolution!\u201d - Reed   \n\u201cI was surprised at how quickly time would fly by as I tried to achieve dominance over the watering hole. The game draws you in.\u201d - Rich   \n\u201cI had so much fun playing the game, I'm constantly playing it in my head.\u201d - Mert I. Erten   \n\u201cI had such a fun time playing the digital version of Evolution, I found myself playing it every bit of free time I had in the day.\u201d - Alex Jimenez \n\u201cAs addictive as the board game- Can't wait to play online and devour my friends!\u201d - Richard E. Moore   \n\u201cThe game was beautifully made and encapsulated every aspect of the board game. Personally this is one of the most interactive games I've played in a long time.\u201d - Adam Hamilton   \n\u201cThe interface was very straightforward and intuitive compared to most board game ports I've played. I can't wait to see the final end result and the future expansions...cough...flight....cough. :)\u201d - Damon Richard \n \u201cThe artwork and animations were absolutely charming, which made it easier for me to sleep at night after having predated several species to extinction.\u201d - Daniel McDonald \n\u201cEasily playable in only 10 minutes, this game gives you the full hour experience in a fraction of the time. The AI is challenging enough that you don't always win, and I found the animations to be charming to the point that they added to my enjoyment.\u201d - Curt Collins \n \u201cThis app looks amazing, sounds amazing, and feels like you're playing the actual game. Super Excited!\u201d - Rocky Pierce \n \u201cThe digital game is beautiful and is the best adaptation of a tabletop game I've seen. The theme of evolving and adaptations is portrayed accurately and in an engaging way, which no small feat from my experience as a biology teacher.\u201d - Jeannette Gerry \n \u201cThe gameplay is smooth and the interface is intuitive. The animations are great and help to show you what's going on without being over the top.\u201d - Eric Sanson \n \u201cA very polished board game port that is true to its roots while enhancing them with the best aspects of digital: incredible replayability, challenging AI, and a beautiful presentation.\u201d - Van Willis \n \u201cDefinitely the best way to enjoy Evolution on the go. Quite possibly the best way to enjoy it, period.\u201d - Lee Nix \n \u201cPlays even better than the board game, and the AI doesn't take as long to think about it's turn as my friends ;-)\u201d - Daniel Schwering \n \u201cI loved the digital implementation of Evolution. Me and my 7 year old played it for hours and it never got stale.\u201d - Corey Brillinger \n\u201cI can't wait to get back to playing again.\u201d - Bryan Piveral \n \"The little details, like card animations during feeding phases, elevate the Evolution playing experience to another level.\u201d - Drew Tschette \n \"This is the best digital adaption i have played.\u201d - Mike Sarcopski \n \u201cI absolutely loved it! One of the best virtual board games I've played!\u201d - Zachary Henry \n \u201cMy first exposure to Evolution was the digital version. I was amazed at not only how much fun it was, but also how quickly one could learn the game play. The game kept me on my toes, provided a good challenge and has rewarding game play.\u201d - Goose Berkowitz-Gosselin \n \u201cWhen a 7 year old opts to play Evolution instead of Pokemon Go, you know it's good!\u201d - Nneka Onwuemene-Hussey \n \u201cI've never been more excited about evolving and extincting species, and doing it so fast, too!\u201d - Andrew Leslie \n \u201cAmazing port from table to screen. A+ guys thanks for making such a great app.\u201d - Michael Rasmussen \n \u201cThe digital implementation of Evolution does a really fantastic job, staying true to the tabletop version, but making the game come alive with its sleek graphic design and great user interface - a must have for app board gamers.\u201d - Max Vigne \n \u201cEvolution is a game system perfect for digital adaptation, and this is a great adaptation.\u201d - Steven Gisinger \n \u201cAn incredibly deep experience made extremely accessible. As a devoted fan of the board game, I was delighted to see such a faithful and beautiful adaptation be brought to life on so many platforms.\u201d - Steven Li \n\u201cThe game was almost perfect in the alpha test and I am sure it has only gotten better since.\u201d - David \n \u201cA great port of a great game. Challenging AI, and a terrific way to learn the game.\u201d - David Ko \n \u201cI played this every day after work. The shortcut has it's own space on my desktop away from everything else so I could find it easier.\u201d - Robert Comeau \n \u201cI enjoyed playing the Evolution video game even more than ice cream, or a double chocolate, chocolaty brownie with caramel on top. I am Soooooo looking forward to the video game.\u201d - Dawn Carter \n\u201cThis game is a blast. One night I lost track of time and went to bed way to late. It was worth it to be extremely tired the next day.\u201d - Kris Drummond  \n\u201cOne of the best interfaces of a board game ever! I even learned I had been playing the rules wrong all this time on the physical version.\u201d - Matt Slowiak\n\u201cI've been excited to play this amazing game on a digital platform since I first saw it at GenCon2016! The Alpha test earlier this summer showed a game that was already playable and enjoyable and I can't wait to see how North Star has polished it since then.\u201d - Shane Morrison  \n\u201cIt's educational but it's also incredibly fun! This game is wonderfully innovative, combining traditional board game style with animations and sound effects to make it come to life.\u201d - Angelica J Alexander  \n\u201cCompletely enjoyable with great graphics. It really helped me get a deeper understanding of the rules and helped me work on my strategy for the game.\u201d - Kim Kieffer  \n\u201cThe Evolution Video Game has given me the freedom to play more and experiment in Evolution more than I thought possible. The flawless gameplay flows so smoothly and efficiently; I have crammed in so many games and new strategies that I will crush my opponents with no mercy next time we play the board game.\u201d - Brian Ganas  \n\u201cWhat a blast! Evolution Video Game brought the board game to life and teleported me to a prehistoric world. I would recommend this game anytime to anyone.\u201d - Kurt Edwards\n\u201cI dreamed about trait combinations and power plays. Can't wait for multiplayer so I can have friends again!\u201d - Steve Smith\n\u201cMy favorite thing about Evolution when I first played it was how it so easily and completely created a perfect ecosystem simulation and I was overjoyed to find that the app did the same and then some. One of the best table to tablet conversions I played.\u201d - Jackson Boom\n\u201cA brilliant digital adaptation to an excellent tabletop game.\u201d - Robert Schuren\n\u201cThe game is great to look at and fluid to watch the animations. It keeps track of everything you need to allow you to just plan your strategy. The AI is difficult but not impossible and interacts in ways that keep the game interesting. I really like it!\u201d - Scott Bowen\n\u201cThis is one of the best digital boardgame conversions I've played, and I'm excited to take evolution anywhere.\u201d - Aric Horst \n\u201cI wish I could have played the game more during the Alpha test. After a few plays, my kids took over and couldn't be pried away. The graphics, sounds, and animations drew them in and the fast-paced gameplay kept them starting new games over and over again!\u201d - Harley Winfrey\n\u201cI've never had so much fun getting my butt kicked by such a well designed AI.\u201d - Xavier\n\u201cSome of the things I love about the video game is its beautiful graphics paired with animation that doesn't change the feeling of the game.\u201d - Tara Ashley\n\u201cPlayed for several hours on a flight from Paris to Addis Ababa. Very much enjoyed the game resulting in no sleep on the red-eye flight.

Super well designed and amazingly fun!\u201d - Clay Diffrient\n\u201cAs a software developer, I am extremely impressed with the stability and software quality of the alpha version. Very few bugs, and very few freezes. Most of the playtesters' input has been tweaking features or improving the AI. Well done!\u201d - Robert O'Hearne\n\u201cPlaying the digital version of Evolution was my first experience with the game and the tutorial did a great job. Theme and artwork on point, adaptive strategies, and great game play. I really enjoyed it!\u201d - Landon (How Lou Sees It) Squire\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, a direct\u00ad response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is North Star Games\u2019 fourth Kickstarter campaign associated with the Evolution product line, so we have an idea of some of the pain points for a campaign of this type.\n\nWith Evolution being North Star\u2019s first video game, we wanted to be sure we could deliver at the level we want before coming to Kickstarter. We've seen too many video games promise release dates and blow far past them. For this reason, we wanted to make sure we had the core gameplay done before coming to Kickstarter and showing it off to fans. \n\nOur final release target is mid 2018. There are many things that can affect how long the game will have to remain in beta for though. Multiple stages of testing and implementation of the feedback we receive takes some time and we don\u2019t want to rush it for the sake of deadlines. Our primary goal is quality, not a deadline.

The player must explore and survive to discover the truth of their mysterious arrival and unknown past. Inhabiting this surreal world, meeting its bizarre denizens, and solving its riddles will unravel not only your own story, but unlock Torla\u2019s many secrets and tangled history.\nYou wake up on the beach of a strange island...\nA mysterious figure appears to you, leaving supplies for your survival.\nYou must harvest and inhabit the environment:\nCraft tools and build structures to make life more fun:\nGrow things for food or pleasure:\nCatch things that lurk within Torla waters:\nMake friend or foe with Torla's majestic fauna:\n Be a helpful neighbor to your fellow Torla-dwellers:\n Solve puzzles throughout the land:\n There's much to be done both day and night:\n And each season holds unique and greater challenges:\nThe rules don't really apply in the land of Torla, and nothing is quite what it seems...\nThe shortest path isn't always the quickest, and exploration may take you in unexpected directions.\nThis strange and whimsical place carries its secrets between many disconnected dimensions, but if there's anything that's clear, it's that something important awaits at the end of this twisting path, and that nothing should be taken for granted.\nBut what about some specifics?:\n  PLAY\n\n    And just like Qora before it, Torla's soundtrack will be integral to the mood and beauty of the adventure. So if you're curious about the soothing sounds that will fill the silence of the Torla landscape, here's a sample:\n  Now that you know some stuff about the game, here's what you need to know about how it's being made and why we're using Kickstarter. \n  Holden divides his time between video games and filmmaking. He released his first PC title, Qora, in 2014, then spent the next year and-a-half making a film in the deserts of Death Valley, California. \nSince Qora's release, Holden has traveled all over the U.S. and China making films and working with a number of programmers on small game projects. Currently located in Boulder, CO, Holden spends his time working on Torla as his two cats, Ponyo and Oupian, watch from the couch. \nHe is the designer, writer, illustrator, animator, and composer for Torla.\nAmir is a spunky L.A. native who spends his days bringing the world of Torla to life, one line of code at a time. Despite his young age, he is extremely passionate about game development and has seven years of experience making games, holds a consistent 5-star satisfaction rating for his freelance work on Upwork, and has even garnered recruiting attention from Fortune 500 companies like Apple and Disney Interactive.\nInspired by classic games like Ron Gilbert\u2019s \u201cMonkey Island\u201d and contemporary atmospheric works like Capybara\u2019s Superbrothers: Sword and Sworcery, Amir was attracted to Torla\u2019s unique blend of traditional point and click controls, RPG mechanics, and quirkiness of Holden\u2019s distinct hand-drawn illustrations.\nHe decided to join Holden back in December 2016, and the two have been working on the project together remotely ever since.\nWell... Holden found Amir in December of 2016, at which they immediately began development on what was to be a short teaser trailer for Torla.  They planned out a few months to create enough content to launch a Kickstarter campaign.\nHowever, very quickly they both fell in love with the project and decided to put the next six months into creating a rich and beautiful world that would be unlike any other. \nWith Amir on the verge of starting his college career, the two were determined to build as much of the game as possible before he had to devote his time to preparing for school at the end of June. \nWith their ideas and designs becoming deeper and more magical each month, they knew that Torla would need a much longer time to develop and truly blossom into the beautiful baby they envisioned. \nToday, Torla is a functioning game with a lot of its foundation completed, its chapters largely prepared, and a few handfuls of pretty places to roam around in, but without the scrutiny and polishing it needs to be presented to the world as a playable piece. \nWe've worked for six months now to prepare a first look at our vision for Torla, and hope it piques your imagination enough to support it here on Kickstarter!\n  Here's the plan:\nTorla's story is told in 3 chapters. Each Chapter will be released separately along with a Prologue and Epilogue. \nWe need to raise the funds to develop the First Chapter which we believe will take about 5 months (minimum) to finish. \nWe'd like to take the time to perfect Torla's foundational code, create a ton of its universal artwork, and have plenty of room to make sure Chapter 1 is absolutely incredible before we release it upon the world. That way, Chapter 2 and 3 will be smooth sailing afterwards. \nWe estimate that all 3 chapters will take about year total to develop, with some added breaks in between chapters. \nA year of hardcore game development requires money, of course!\nMostly, we need to eat, drink, and shelter ourselves during the game-making process. However, there's also a couple things we need to pay for at certain points in development. \nTake a look at this fancy chart that breaks it all down:\nSo why are we only asking for the funds for Chapter 1? \nWe believe that the most important part of any large creative project is getting it started. Once the funds are in place for our team to be together creating Torla full-time, there's no stopping us from that point forward.\nWe are extremely confident that once Torla makes it onto the marketplace, it will both fund itself, and attract enough support to carry it through to the finish line. (And don't worry, we have extra fallbacks, just in case!)\nPLAY\n\n However... if by a stroke of well-deserved luck, Torla's Kickstarter Goal of $36,000 is met with time to spare, we will keep charging forward in hopes to fund Chapter 2 and Chapter 3!\nThat's right folks, for an additional $27,000 each, we will be able to fund the development of the remaining 2 chapters and finish the game!!!\n  PLAY\n\n  Oh. You'd like something in return for your support?... \nOK! Here's the stuff we wanna give you for helping us make Torla (See the actual Rewards options for more details):\nSee anything you like? We don't want our backers to feel like they're just \"pre-purchasing\" the game, but have access to awesome stuff that you can only get by backing the campaign.\nPLAY\n\n  We will not only be creating awesome content on a regular basis, but will be spoiling you with it via Kickstarter Updates, Twitter Posts, and our Mailing List. \nSo whether or not you decide to support the game here on Kickstarter, keep checking back for new artwork, levels, characters, and other material that we'll be posting during the campaign. \n      ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMaking a game takes time.

With a groundbreaking job system that combined the usual character classes like knights, thieves, and mages with offbeat classes such as chemists, dancers, and bards, the game appeared to be a shoo-in for North American distribution. But the game was dubbed \"too hardcore\" for a Western audience and was swapped out with Final Fantasy Mystic Quest, a simplistic new game tailor-made for Americans.  \nThat didn't stop a teenage Chris Kohler from tracking down Final Fantasy V. The young RPG fan got a Japanese copy of the game, used it to teach himself Japanese, and with the help of some internet companions created the first-ever comprehensive English-language FAQ of the game. As the internet narrowed the cultural gap between the East and West more each year, the game was eventually translated into English for the PlayStation, Game Boy Advance, and iOS. \nFans in the West finally got to learn what all the fuss was about. Now the acclaimed author of Power-Up and an editor at Kotaku, Kohler is revisiting the game that started his career in games journalism. Based on new, original interviews with Final Fantasy V's director, Hironobu Sakaguchi, as well as previously untranslated interviews with the rest of the development team, Kohler's book weaves history and criticism to examine one of the Final Fantasy series's greatest and most overlooked titles.\nRead an early excerpt at Kotaku and listen to the author talk about the game on this recent episode of Retronauts.\nChris Kohler is the author of Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life, and the founding editor of Game|Life, the Webby-nominated video game section of WIRED. He is currently Features Editor of Kotaku, and lives in the San Francisco Bay Area. \nShovel Knight by David L. Craddock\nIn 2014, Yacht Club Games released its very first game, Shovel Knight, a joyful 2D platformer that wears its NES influences on its sleeve. This unlikely pastiche of 8-bit inspirations manages to emulate the look, feel, and even the technical limitations of nostalgic titles like Mega Man, Zelda II, and Castlevania III\u2014imbued with a contemporary sense of humor and self-awareness. But how is a fundamentally retro game created in the modern era? And what do the games of the past have to teach today's game designers?  \nBased on extensive original interviews with the entire Yacht Club Games team, writer David L. Craddock unearths the story of five game developers who worked so well together while at WayForward Games that they decided to start their own studio. From the high highs of Shovel Knight's groundbreaking Kickstarter to the low lows of its unexpectedly lengthy development, Boss Fight presents a new master class in how a great game gets made. Get ready to steel your shovel and dig into this fascinating oral history. For Shovelry!\nDavid L. Craddock lives with his wife and business partner in Ohio. He is the author of Stay Awhile and Listen, a three-part series that chronicles the history of World of WarCraft developer Blizzard Entertainment and Diablo/Diablo II developer Blizzard North; Break Out: How the Apple II Launched the PC Gaming Revolution by Schiffer Publishing; and HERITAGE, a young adult fantasy novel. Connect with David on Twitter or Facebook.\nNBA Jam by Reyan Ali\nWhen NBA Jam dunked its way into arcades in 1993, players discovered just how fun basketball can be when freed from rules, refs, and gravity itself. But just a few years after Midway's billion-dollar hit conquered the world, Midway, home version publisher Acclaim, and even video arcades themselves fell off the map. How did a simple two-on-two basketball game become MVP of the arcade, and how did this champ lose its title?  \nJournalist Reyan Ali dives deep into the saga, tracking the people and decisions that shaped the series. You'll get to know mischievous Jam architect Mark Turmell, go inside Midway's Chicago office where hungry young talent tapped into cutting-edge tech, and explore the sequels, spin-offs, and tributes that came in the game's wake.\nBuilt out of exhaustive research and original interviews with a star-studded cast -- including Turmell and his original development team, iconic commentator Tim Kitzrow, developers and executives at Midway and Acclaim alike, secret characters George Clinton and DJ Jazzy Jeff, Atari founder Nolan Bushnell, Doom co-creator John Romero, and 1990s NBA demigods Glen Rice and Shaq -- Ali's NBA Jam returns you to an era when coin-op was king.\nFollow Reyan's progress on Twitter at @nbajambook.\nReyan Ali is a writer from Columbus, Ohio. He\u2019s been published by Wired, Rolling Stone, Spin, The Atlantic, Pacific Standard, and alt-weekly papers across the country. Born in Dallas, he grew up in Karachi, Pakistan, where he soaked up 1990s NBA action almost exclusively through trading cards, Beckett Basketball back issues, and NBA Jam: Tournament Edition on the Sega Mega Drive. His first writing gig was contributing to the Mortal Kombat Netherealm (MKNe), a fan site long lost to time. At MKNe in 2000, he scored his very first interview: GamePro editor Dan Elektro. Over a decade later, he interviewed Elektro once more -- this time for NBA Jam, his first book. \nStar Wars: Knights of the Old Republic by Alex Kane\nSet in an even longer time ago in a galaxy far, far away, BioWare's 2003 RPG Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic wowed Jedi and Sith Lords alike with its compelling characters, lightsaber customization, complex morality choices, and one of the greatest plot twists in video game history. Among the droids and blasters, the game delves into themes like choice, free will, and the construction of identity and memory.\nFeaturing brand new interviews with Lead Designer James Ohlen and Senior Writer Drew Karpyshyn, game critic Alex Kane's book unveils how this classic game was made, analyzes KotOR's worldview through the lens of philosophy, mythology, and the ethics of war, and investigates how the game borrows techniques from contemporary films like The Sixth Sense and Fight Club. Whether you align with the light or the dark side, you're invited to dive into this fun and thoughtful exploration of the most beloved Star Wars game of all time.\nYou can read an early excerpt of the book here.\nAlex Kane is a freelance journalist and critic based in west-central Illinois. His work has appeared in Glixel, Kill Screen, the website of Rolling Stone, StarWars.com, and elsewhere.\nPostal by Brock Wilbur & Nathan Rabin\nIn 1997, game studio Running with Scissors released its debut title, Postal, an isometric shooter aimed at shocking an imagined pearl-clutching public. The game focused on a disgruntled \"Postal Dude\" whose goal is to murder as many people as possible. It was crass, gory, and dumb\u2014all of which might have been forgivable if the game had been any fun to play.  \nPostal gained enough notoriety from riding the wave of public outrage to warrant a sequel. And DLC. And a remake. And, perhaps most surprising of all, a Golden-Raspberry-winning feature film adaptation directed by the infamous Uwe Boll.  \nIn this thoughtful and hilarious tag-team performance, comedian Brock Wilbur & media critic Nathan Rabin mine the fascinatingly troubled game and film for what each can tell us about shock culture & mass shootings, interviewing the Scissors team and even Boll himself for answers. Like it or not, Postal is the franchise that won't die\u2014no matter how many molotov cocktails you throw at it.\nBrock Wilbur is a writer and comedian from Kansas who now lives in Los Angeles. He lives with his wife Vivian and their cat, Cat. He is the author of a forthcoming book about growing up with a adopted Bosnian brother, and an investigative journalism piece where he exposes a cult that has haunted the east coast since the late 70s.\nNathan Rabin is the former head writer of The A.V Club and a staff writer for The Dissolve as well as the author of six books, including The Big Rewind (Scribner), My World of Flops (Scribner), Weird Al: The Book (with Al Yankovic) (Abrams) and most recently 7 Days in Ohio and Kanye & Trump for his own imprint, Declan Haven Books. He is also the proprietor, owner and editor-in-chief of his own website, Nathan Rabin\u2019s Happy Place. He lives in Decatur, Georgia with his wife, dog Ghostface Killah, and son Declan.\nEach campaign, backers get a chance to decide the subject of one of our upcoming books. Thanks to our supporters, we've published fan-selected books on Chrono Trigger and Shadow of the Colossus, and last season's choice Final Fantasy VI is planned for future release. Now it's time for you to pick the next fan-selected Boss Fight Book.\nWhen you back the campaign, hit the comments section and name the game you most want to read a book about. Then, in the final week of the campaign, we're going to tally all the games mentioned and create a shortlist of 3-4 finalists, and you can vote once more on the finalists. From there, we'll put out a call for book pitches about that particular game, and choose the author who we think will write the best book.\nMay the best game win!\n  Since the series launch, Boss Fight Books has been written up in top-tier publications. Check out a small sample of our reviews for last season's books:\nOn Super Mario Bros. 3 (named one of author Dennis Cooper's Favorite Nonfiction Books of 2016): \"Super Mario Bros. 3 is worth a look, especially if that mustachioed plumber holds a place of reverence in your own nostalgic heart.\" - ZAM\nOn Mega Man 3: \"This is a fantastic book for anyone who is interested in the history of Mega Man, Nintendo in general, video game design, the Japanese gaming industry, nostalgia, and excellent writing.\" - E.C. Myers\nOn Soft & Cuddly: \"[...] a love note to all things grungy and bootleg, to everyone who managed to succeed despite standing in their own way.\" - Heavy Feather Review\nOn Kingdom Hearts II: \"[I]t's Alexa's own personal story and attachment to the game's questions [...] that make up the hardest-hitting points of her critiques and analyses over the series. If this is the start to a new age of discussion over the series, I welcome it with an open heart.\" - Kingdom Hearts Insider\nYou can check out our Press page for more coverage, and read some reviews at Goodreads and Amazon.\nTry before you buy!

This is so that we can get you your copies of Final Fantasy V while still finishing up Katamari.\nSeptember 2017: Digital Kickstarter rewards arrive (Anthology, bonus eBooks, etc.).\nOctober 2017: First book, Final Fantasy V, arrives.

(Includes shipping in the U.S., with an additional $10 per book internationally.)\nAnd if you're new to Boss Fight, you could get the whole 22-book catalog for $100 (digital) or $400 (paperback + digital).\nIf you've been with Boss Fight awhile, we hope you'll take this opportunity to renew your subscription. Your support will allow us to keep Boss Fight publishing great books about classic video games, and you'll keep receiving each of our books before its public release.\nIf you're new to Boss Fight, we're glad you found us!

WOOHOO!!!  \nYou can check out my series at  \nYOUTUBE.COM/RAHDO  \nAs a sampler, here's a playlist of some recent runthroughs I've done (click \"playlist\" in the top left to see a long list of video choices):  \nI make these videos primarily as a way of sharing my enthusiasm and passion for the boardgaming hobby, and helping like-minded board game geeks choose which of the myriad games on the market are right for them.  \nBut as it happens, as of 2013, I've retired from full-time employment, and now, to be able to continue to produce runthrough videos, I need to raise funds to cover my operating expenses (game purchases, travel expenses to game conventions, and a salary to be able to stay devoted 100% to the show).  \nFan Support Makes it all Possible  \nThat's where you come in, because I receive no direct income for Rahdo Runs Through except for fan support in these yearly fund raising drives. I accept no payments from game developers for any game (retail or Kickstarter prototype) that I run through, and I don't turn on YouTube ads (because they're awful), so you folks are truly what keeps Rahdo running through! :)  \nBy backing this, my fifth RAHDO RUNS THROUGH Kickstarter campaign, you're funding my ability to continue to produce videos of all the latest, hottest games, ranging from the big games of the moment like Arkham Horror the Card Game and Gloomhaven, to the soon to be released hits like Pandemic Legacy Season 2 and Charterstone. \nJust a few of the many games that could be coming soon, with your help...\nIn return for your donation, you have access to a variety of rewards. What are they, you might be wondering? I'm glad you asked... \nTHE BACKER REWARDS \nRahdo Runs Through VOTING! Exclusive microbadges!\n  Custom signed stickers & game bags crocheted with love!\n  Lucky dip markers and waterjet meeples galore!\n  WITWAT? They're keeping an eye out for you!\n  Supersize your meeples!\n  Co-host or direct the show!\n  Secret Council Membership!\nSo what's all this then? Lucky Dips? Secret Councils? Directors? WITWAT? Don't worry, I've got you covered. Check out this video, which walks you through all the different options, including how the WILDCARD backing system works! :)\nTHE STRETCH GOALS \nOkay, so the target goal for this year basically covers all the new games I'll be acquiring to film, another trip to Essen for more convention coverage and a basic salary for me and Paulo Renato (the fine fellow who fact checks and annotates all my vids... Paulo is l'awesome and keeps me honest!). But, if we go above and beyond the target, below is some additional content that can be provided over the next 12 months! \nStretch Goal #1: Rahdo Talks Through, the Podcast ($35,000)  \nHitting this stretch goal means I'll continue my twice-Golden Geek Award-nominated podcast series where I talk about exciting upcoming games, revisit top10 topics to delve further, and answer plenty of questions (joined each month by Jen).\nYou can subscribe to the series here: http://podcast.rahdo.com\nStretch Goal #2: Jen Runs Through ($40,000) \nRahdo Runs Through is mostly a one-man show, but people do love it when my lovely wife Jen makes appearances to help me play and demonstrate the games (rather than my normal \"virtual\" Jen gaming partner!) \nOf course, it's time consuming to film runthroughs, and that takes her away from her actual career of making beautiful glass art. But, if we hit this 2nd stretch goal, Jen will commit to appearing in 12 runthroughs over the course of the year (roughly once each month), and I can tell you right now, the shows she's in are always the most fun to watch! \nTo give you an idea of what a Jen-enhanced video is like, here's a playlist of all the videos she's been in to date: http://jen.rahdo.com \nStretch Goal #3: Rahdo Runs Through LIVE! ($50,000) \nThis stretch goal is all about filming live game runthroughs (plus Q&A) every other month. Last year my schedule for these was a bit off, and I'm getting them all done this very month! So tune in on any given Saturday in April to join the fun.\nHere's a playlist of all the live events done so far to see what they're like! \nStretch Goal #4: Rahdo & Jen's top100!!! ($55,000)\nFolks have been asking for this literally for years now, and if we hit this stretch, Jen and I will finally buckle down and make a series of videos where we discuss both of our top 100 games of all time!  \n  \"Thanks for watching, talk to you later, so long, buh bye!\"\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI'm not really anticipating any particular challenges or risks - other than maybe laryngitis!

All copies are ready in our USA warehouse for immediate shipping! \n  Mothership takes the best elements from dice combat games and blends them into an easy to pick up, unpredictable and enjoyable gaming experience. It's light-hearted, engaging and the most fun you will have had rolling dice in ages!\nFeatured on:\nMothership is a tabletop dice combat game for 2 to 6 people. Players take turns moving ships, attacking other players, capturing planets and managing an economy.\nYour fleet is composed of three unique ship types, including the versatile Mothership that can modify its weapons, shields and engines on the fly.\nAll players start with the same fleet of ships on a balanced board that changes every time you play. Battles occur between ships using dice and players must protect their own base while attacking their enemy's base.\nTo get the edge over their opponents, players must capture planets and spend resources on upgrading a technology tree. The technology tree complements certain strategies and there is no bad choice. It all comes down to your ability to out-smart the enemy.\nMothership also throws a little chaos into the mix with Action cards! You can choose to put your money into chance or careful strategy... or both! \nMothership caters to a variety of play styles. You could choose to rely on chance and luck of the draw to win you the game. Perhaps you're the type of person who favors strategy and careful planning. Or perhaps deceit, betrayal and broken alliances are more your cup of tea? Whatever your play style, Mothership has you covered!\nMothership can also be played with alternative Victory Point rules for a fluid, faster paced experience!\n Features\nControl Panel: You can change your Mothership\u2019s stats every turn by managing energy.\nDynamic: The game board changes every time you play. You can create your own board layout using the asteroid tiles!\nBalance: All players have an equal chance, yet can choose from a wide range of tactics. \nEngaging: There\u2019s never a dull moment! You still have a chance of winning right up until you lose your last ship. \nTechnology Tree: Allows players to choose different tactics each time they play. \nAccessible: First time players can compete against veterans of dice combat games. Mothership can also be simplified for younger players by removing the tech tree while still being a ton of fun!\n    Game Pieces: 6x Colony Stations, 6x Motherships, 18x Fighters, 12x Bombers, 42x Capture Markers, 8x Planets, 50x Transparent stands\nPrinted: 1x Game board (20\"), 6x Mothership Control Panels, 6x Tech Trees, 92x Action cards, 30x Resource cards, 12x Artifact cards, 6x Victory Point cards, 10x Asteroid tiles, 12x Exploration Tokens\nCounters: 126x blue energy, 96x red HP, 24x grey\nDice: 1x D4, D6, D8, D10, D12 \nGame Pieces: 2x Colony Stations, 2x Motherships, 6x Fighters, 4x Bombers, 14x Capture Markers, 4x Planets, 18x Transparent stands \nPrinted: 8x Class cards, 4x Wormhole tiles, 8x Nebula tiles, 5x Action Cards\nDice: 1x Random Event D6\nWhat's New in the Expansion Pack\nKickstarter Exclusive Black and Silver ships: Blow up space ships in style with these limited edition colours. Comes with matching capture markers.\nNebula tiles: Add another element to your board with Nebula tiles. Ships can only move a maximum of 1 space through nebula but won't take damage. This simple new element adds an entirely new layer of strategy when paired with...\nWormholes: Two way wormholes transport ships instantly to the other side creating new ways to play. Flip them over to reveal black Wormholes that can have more than one exit.\nClass Cards: Receive a random Class card at the beginning of the game to further specialize your fleet. Each card has a one-use action ability and technology upgrade that no one else has. With up to eight different Classes, there's something to suit any play style.\nPrevious Stretch Goals\nThe incredible support from our backers throughout the last campaign meant that we were able to reach some great stretch goals. You\u2019ll be happy to know, that most of the stretch goals unlocked in the last campaign will now be included in the initial funding goal for this campaign. This will mean...\nThe amazing three piece plastic tray will return!\nMothership features a beautiful way to store your ships.\n  The tray splits off into a card holder that you can use during the game.\nPlastic Capture Markers are also included in all colours, a significant upgrade from the original chipboard hexes.\nEven though they look edible...please do not eat the capture markers.\nPlanetary Exploration: Explore the planets you conquer! Uncover ancient alien artifacts that may help you overpower and annihilate your enemies. But be careful! The artifacts you discover are tied to the planet they were found on. If someone else captures your planet, that relic you worked so tirelessly to find will be transferred to them. You\u2019ll be forced to sit there and watch as they enjoy the perks of your discovery.\nEach planet has a unique artifact to discover.\nDouble-sided Board: Flip the game board occasionally to enjoy a change of scenery, as you gaze upon a fresh new starscape to battle it out on.\nBoth sides provide the same amount of hex spaces.\n Here's a great un-boxing video of the first edition by Epitrapaizoume.\n  Backstory\nThe great Space Disagreement of 5406 has forced your entire colony to flee into the dark depths of outer space. You\u2019re not alone. Other colonies too seek refuge from the war. All scramble to harvest the valuable resources on undiscovered planets. Your mission: destroy all other colonies. Diplomacy is boring. Shoot first, confirm if they were enemies later...\nThe Basics\n1. Move, 2. attack, 3. get planets, 4. get money and 5. buy upgrades.\nIf you didn't get a good idea of how to play from the video then you can also read the full rule book here!\nGame Play Video\nTantrum House also made a nice overview of the game.\nDynamic Game Board\nNever play the same game twice! Players are able to enjoy a great deal of versatility and unpredictability by setting up the asteroids in any layout they like. This feature of Mothership ensures that no two games need ever be the same. Some layout examples are included in the rule book, but many more ideas can be found by checking out the Board Layout page on the website.\n     Add the following amounts to your pledge if you wish to order add-ons.\n              Kickstarter surveys will be handled by BackerKit, which means you will have maximum flexibility to change your details and add-ons right up until our shipping date.\nMotheship has almost been stretched to the limit! That's why you will find most of the stretch goals are for the Into the Vortex expansion. Each goal states what it upgrades.\n  BGG Page - Launch Tweet - Facebook Launch Post - Facebook Page - BGG Artwork\nOut now on the Apple App Store and Google Play is an app designed to complement your ship exploding, dice rolling experience.\nApple App Store \u2013 Google Play\nHTML 5 Version: Dice Roller \u2013 Fleet Manager\nFleet Manager\nFleet Manager combines one player\u2019s Control Panel and Technology Tree into a single screen. Using the plus and minus buttons you can increase and decrease energy across your Mothership\u2019s subsystems. The Tech Tree also highlights when you upgrade your fleet and will only allow you to select one branch per tree. When you upgrade your blue Support tree to include extra Mothership energy, this automatically gets added to your Control Panel.\nIt doesn\u2019t end there though! As you\u2019re aware, the Tech Tree also adds buffs to the rolls of your Fighters or Bombers. Tap the dice button and you\u2019re taken to a personal dice roller that connects to your Tech Tree and automatically adds your buffs for you! This screen also sports a large area to display the current roll, roll history (up to four places) and buttons for regular dice.\nStand-Alone Dice Roller\nObviously each player in your gaming group may not have a device to run the app, so there is also a stand-alone Dice Roller which can be used for the entire table. This module features buttons for normal dice, the Random Event D6 and buttons that correspond to Fighter and Bomber rolls, their buffs and multiple ships attacking at once.\nWhat you should know before downloading: The app will run and look it\u2019s best on tablets. As requested by the community, I haven\u2019t restricted the app to any particular device type. \nThis means that you can download it to a phone if you wish. However, please keep in mind that the app was not originally designed for such a small screen space, and as such the buttons may be too small, and some of the text may be difficult to read clearly. I have done the best that I can to help with these issues by adding a zoom button. Please also note that I haven\u2019t restricted the app to new devices with the latest operating software, so if you run it on an older device, it may lag a little between the menus.\nFeatured on:\nRead or watch the reviews here:\nPolygon - Just Press Start - Geek and Sundry -Tantrum House - Game On\n  Thanks to our collaboration with three different shipping partners, we are able to offer customs-friendly shipping to the following regions: Europe, USA and Australia/New Zealand. Canadian packages will be sent from the USA but still shouldn't incur any customs charges.\nAll shipping will be calculated and charged after the campaign ends through BackerKit.\nBackerkit has a more robust shipping system than Kickstarter, meaning that we can ensure only the most accurate shipping prices are charged, while factoring in your pledge tier, all stretch goals and all add-ons. In the meantime, we can offer estimated shipping costs.\nBackers in Canada: We can offer customs-friendly shipping if we get 100 Canadian backers, so if you've been holding back, pledge now!\nBackers in Asia: Send me a message and I'll check the shipping cost to your country.\nWe apologise to those in countries where shipping is more expensive. Mothership is a massive, heavy game and we\u2019ve done our best to keep the prices as low as we possibly can. \nTo keep costs low, try getting some friends together and buy a 3-pack instead of making individual orders, you will be able to save on postage this way.\n  Peter Sanderson is the lead designer, artist and creator of Mothership. This is his greatest project ever and is the culmination of everything he loves about board games and science fiction.\nJust about everything you see on this page has been crafted by Peter, except for the following special thanks: Graeme, for the backing ukulele in the videos. Alkira and Nathan for their voice work in the launch trailer. Brendan, Bjorn and Bianca for being involved in filming and countless hours of playtesting.\nExtra special thanks goes to my wife Alkira, who encouraged me to waste a good chunk of my life making this game.\nAlso integral to the project this time around is Paul Johnson from Aetherworks Australia and Damon Mccarley.

Combine brutal biology, relentless robotics, mind-bending physics and volatile chemistry as you compete to become the most infamous monster-building scientist. The nefarious possibilities are almost endless\u2014the parts in one XYbrid deck can create more than half a billion different monsters. \nEach card is transparent, so building your monster is a creative experience unlike any other game\u2014and because each card has different art on either side, the path to ultimate infamy is always uniquely yours.\nGAMEPLAY\nPlayers take turns drawing parts from the Lab and using them to build monsters that will increase their infamy score. Each monster begins with a core part, and is complete when it has a head, two arms, and legs. Secret Breakthrough cards help players formulate strategies and unleash surprises each round\u2014will you go for brute force or cunning combinations?\u2014while Mission effects raise the stakes as the game goes on. After 3 rounds, the most infamous player wins!\nLearn all the rules with the digital guide, and watch the Learn-to-Play video:\n                          The spirit of the Brand-a-Bot pledge level is to let players put their personal, permanent mark on XYbrid by including their initials in a piece of card art. In science fiction, you often see arbitrary letters and numbers adorning robots and machines\u2014this is your chance to become those arbitrary letters and numbers! Here are the rules:\nYou submit a sequence of up to 3 letters and/or numbers with your survey after the end of the campaign. This can be your initials, or birthdate, or any creative, meaningful group of 3 alphanumeric characters. I handle everything from there. \nI reserve the right to reject a submission for any reason. Some reasons may include: offensive or suggestive content, trademarked content, submissions greater than 3 characters, submissions with special characters, etc. \nIf your submission is rejected, I will work with you to come to an acceptable alternative. \nStylistic choices such as color, font, and placement are at the discretion of the artist. Please know that the goal is to make your \u201cbrand\u201d large and bold (not to hide it within the art).\n  Transparent cards are what make XYbrid a uniquely visual gaming experience. Unfortunately, most manufacturers aren\u2019t equipped to produce transparent cards\u2014it requires special machines, inks, and material. Start to finish, the creation of a XYbrid deck is simply more expensive than it would be for standard paper cards. The basic pledge level of $29 helps cover the increased production cost of making something that looks and plays extra cool.\nThe funding goal of $14,500 is based on close and specific coordination with two manufacturers who provided quotes for producing XYbrid. After factoring in additional fees and shipping estimates, I believe this goal is the most realistic target that allows for a reasonable game price.\nThe pledge levels are simple by design. As this is my first foray into game production, I chose to focus on getting the game itself right, and avoid the added complexity of extra components, perks, or stretch goals. This strategy keeps cost down and removes distractions during the critical production and fulfillment phases.\nFor this project, shipped rewards will come from the United States. While I am happy to send copies of XYbrid anywhere in the world, I do not have distribution partners in Europe or Asia at this time. Please know that customs charges and value-added taxes (VAT) may arise but are different for every country and are the responsibility of the backer upon delivery.\nYou can find more details about manufacturing and delivery in the Risks and Challenges Section below.\n  ABOUT THE DESIGNER\nI'm Gabe. My day job is in graphic design and user experience. I get paid to create things people enjoy interacting with, and over the years I\u2019ve directed more than a few projects that required unusual art production\u2014hence my confidence in bringing a transparent card game to life. I'm committed to understanding how players consume fun\u2014I study what motivates people to engage with, learn, and solve problems; then I use that knowledge to make stuff.\nI've been concocting game ideas since I was a kid, but XYbrid is my first public game design. It grew from my love of modular creativity (my childhood was all Mega Man and Lego) and my love of mind-blowing, weird science. In fact, many XYbrid cards are inspired by real-life scientific concepts.\nMy favorite tabletop games are quick to play, but allow for deeper strategy to develop as players learn. XYbrid was designed, developed, and tested over 4 years to provide this type of play experience, built around a unique visual style. My hope is that Kickstarter will bring people like me together to make this quirky, creative game a reality.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMANUFACTURING\nThe concept and vision for XYbrid has been vetted by two proven, global game manufacturers. The vendor I am planning to use for manufacturing is located in Hong Kong, and has assured me that their company can accomplish the printing of two-sided transparent plastic cards. Producing XYbrid as I have described above is contingent on their word and ability.\n\nThe production process will begin almost immediately after funding. With the exception of adjustments for the Brand-a-Bot pledge level, the art for all 116 cards (and the rulebook) is already finished. Box art is nearly finished as well, needing only to be transferred into a technical format for manufacturing.\n\nTIMING\nMy delivery target is November 2017.\n\nThe process for review and approval of products manufactured in Asia can take weeks. I have accounted for a reasonable amount of back-and-forth in the timeline, but errors and/or misunderstandings resulting in unforeseen rounds of revision can extend the production timeline and delay delivery. International customs and/or changing international trade policies\u2014while completely out of my control\u2014can also impact timing and cost.\n\nAn overwhelming number of backers could require additional manufacturing or fulfillment coordination which may also delay delivery.\n\nSHIPPING\nBackers are asked to provide shipping information (and possibly other information, depending on pledge level) promptly after a successfully funded campaign. Providing inaccurate shipping information may result in additional fees to correct.\n\nErrors can occur during shipping, such as lost or damaged items. In such cases, backers can contact me to arrange for replacement items.\n\nBy placing a pledge, you affirm that you\u2019ve read and understand the Risks and Challenges section.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Honorary Scientist", "descp": "Receive a heartfelt thanks and a powerful sense of superiority as you achieve honorary XYbrid Scientist status.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2017"}], "stat": ["23 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 29 or more", "title": "XYbrid Game", "descp": "Enjoy one copy of XYbrid in full transparent, monstrous glory.

Select your hero by combining two character options: your role and race. Your role is your profession and your race is your species. This combination drives your hero's strengths, weaknesses, and defines your special abilities. You'll use dry erase markers (or print your own high quality hero sheets) to keep track of your hero's strength.\nTravel across the map earning power-ups by completing quests and battling opponents of multiple types. Move carefully to avoid many dangers and travel from city to city, visiting shrines and ruins along the way.\nGain power quickly, for the Dead King also moves... he destroys the cities while you frantically gather the power necessary to stop him. For each city the Dead King destroys, he gains more power.\nThe object of HEXplore It is to power up your heroes as quickly as possible, to eventually defeat the Dead King himself. The game is won if you confront and defeat him, bringing light back to the Valley.\nCan you save the Valley from the Dead King?\n  Game Features\nCooperative game play\nFantasy-themed hero building\nVariable hero powers and combinations\nOrganic & customizable hero advancement\nModular board\nThousands of potential map layouts\nMap built to interlock with future expansions\nStrategic movement\nExploration & questing\n40+ unique combat scenarios\nDice-rolling & press-your-luck scenarios\nDynamic play duration\nCustomizable game difficulty\n Play Styles\n  Social Media links: \n           We\u2019ve built dozens of Roles and dozens of Races for HEXplore It, and we\u2019re far from finished. The Core Game began with 6 of each, but our community has unlocked more. We\u2019re hoping to bring you all 720 Hero Combinations! \nAs we reach our goals, we\u2019ll be able to unlock even more combinations, which will be included in every game.\n  The Roles\nCreating your hero begins with selecting your role. Your role defines the part you\u2019ll play during the game. Each player mat is a durable dry erase board, and you\u2019ll use dry erase markers to keep track of your scores as you play the game.\n  There are five types of roles, based on what function they play in the game. The five types are: Assist, Healer, Sapper, Striker, and Utility.\nEach role will be printed double-sided on thick cardboard. The player card appears on the front and original artwork for each role on the back.\n   The Races\nAfter you select your role, you'll also select a race for your hero. Each race has modifiers that augment your role, offering a unique play experience each time you play a different combination.\nYou\u2019ll find differences in all of your stats, your Favored Enemy, Food Rating, and finally the special ability. Like the roles, our campaign begins with six races unlocked. \n Masteries & Special Abilities\nEach hero gains two masteries from their role, and a single racial ability based on their species. These abilities require a mix of health and energy to use. Most masteries are usable only in combat, but some can also be used outside of combat. Each mastery and racial ability are unique.\nLet\u2019s look at the Beast Master below. Combined with the wise Elf, the Beastmaster could affect the Circumstances in play. By choosing the stubborn Dwarf for instance (as seen below), this Beastmaster could force the group to Wander. As you explore the game you\u2019ll want to experiment with all sorts of fun combinations.\n Roles & Races in the Core Box\n  How are we going to pick which Role is unlocked next?\nWe aren\u2019t. You are!\nThe portal below has been activated! If you've backed the project, you can step through to vote on your favorite role for each of the five types. When a new role is unlocked, we\u2019ll consult the poll to select the one with the most votes.\nCheck the backer-only update labeled: \"The portal is now open!\" for the password to enter.\n     How will the Races be unlocked?\nEach race has been assigned to a specific role, and for purposes of the artwork we\u2019ll be creating for each. When a new role is unlocked, a new race will be unlocked along with it.\n  Can I purchase the extra heroes that haven't been unlocked yet?\nYes! We've now included an optional add-on for you to purchase all of the roles and races that have been prepared for HEXplore It. We've done this because of the overwhelming requests and we feel it will only help the campaign. For more detail, check out the Add On section below.\n Exclusive Kickstarter Only Races\nAll six of the exclusive races have been unlocked! The exclusive race cards are more powerful than their normal counterparts, and will not appear in this form in other versions of the game! \n   The Battle Mat\nLike the role cards, you'll use dry erase markers to keep track of your opponents' vitals. In addition to this, you can use the Battle Mat to keep track of various group effects and bonuses. \n   Bosses\nBosses are the most difficult opponents your Heroes will face. They offer substantial rewards to your group, which will help prepare your heroes to face the last boss: the Dead King. There are five double sided cards for a total of ten bosses in the game.\n  The Bandit Prince\n   Game Play and Market Cards\nIn addition to the boss cards shown above, the Core Box contains four game play cards: the Game Aid, the City/Market card, the Black Market/Market card, and the Shrine/Ruin card. \n   A Modular Map\nHEXplore It features a modular game board that changes with each play through. Four main quadrants can be positioned in dozens of ways before the game begins, which affects both the players and the Dead King. Create impassible terrain by rotating the quadrants in any way you choose.\nAs soon as the group reaches the edge of the map, reveal a random extension called a \u201cHEX Tile\u201d. These extensions may contain Quests, Ruins, Bosses, or Shrines.\nIn addition to the quadrants and hex tiles, the game features a Circumstance mat and Quest mat, and several location markers. Each mat is made of two interlocking pieces that fit into both the top and bottom of the game board. The markers are hexagon shaped pieces that designate various game locations.\n Punchboards in the Core Box\n  Here are a few of the many quadrant setups:\nWe're also including several small connector pieces, to help close any gaps or build some narrow bridges in your terrain. These are an optional addition to your game.\n   The Circumstance Deck \nThis deck is full of interesting scenarios, deadly afflictions, magical trinkets, combat encounters and more! Each game turn, a player will roll a six-sided die to determine the Circumstance they\u2019ll experience that turn.\nThe Circumstance mat is composed of two interlocking pieces that affix to the top of the game board. Players draw five cards from the Circumstance Deck and place them face up in the slots marked 1-5. During the Circumstance phase of the game turn, one player will roll a six sided die. The result becomes the Circumstance the players will face this turn. If you roll a six during the Circumstance phase, you\u2019ll draw a card blindly from the deck. \n   The Quest Deck\nThis deck is full of Quests the group can attempt to accomplish in order to gain access to the Power Up deck. There are seven types of cards in the Quest deck: Navigate, Explore, Survival, Arcs, Escort, Invasion, and Bounty. Quests are written in a short story format, adding flavor to your game.\nLike the Circumstance mat at the top of the board, the Quest mat lays out at the bottom of the game board. Here players will find five active Quests to complete. You\u2019ll also find the Wander graphic on the Quest mat. You\u2019ll use this whenever the group wanders off course.\n   The Power Up Deck\nThe Power Up Deck is full of cards that increase your hero\u2019s statistics. You\u2019ll gain access to this deck as you complete quests, defeat difficult encounters, bosses, and explore ruins. Strengthen your heroes as quickly as you can, or the Dead King will outpace you and conquer the valley!\n   The Dead King's Deck\nHEXplore It also features a One vs. All play style, where one player takes on the role of the Dead King. Mess with the heroes and attempt to wreak havoc on their campaign to destroy you! Each turn you'll draw a card from your deck, slowly giving you more power to destroy them once and for all...\n  Card of the Day\nEach day we'll showcase a single card that appears in the game. Stay tuned each day to check them out!\n                                     Check out our library of ever-growing videos below. You'll be able to see previews, reviews, and even entire play-throughs of the game. Thanks for checking them out!\n                               HEXplore the Rulebook\n           We'll be using Pledge Manager at the end of the campaign, which will allow you to manage your pledge details after the campaign ends!\nWe'll be using Pledge Manager!\n  Heroes of HEXplore It: Digital Download\nThe Heroes of HEXplore It PDF will be a full color booklet that contains artwork and short stories featuring many of our roles and bosses. Many of the short stories are currently featured on our website. \nWe can't quite tell you how many pages we'll have in the book, as that will depend partially on how many roles we'll manage to unlock during the campaign. We can tell you the book will contain at least 20 pages.\n Core Box\nThe Core box contains all items shown on the \"Core Box\" graphic at the top of the page. As we unlock our stretch goals, the Core game will gain more content! Each Core Box will contain the extra content unlocked in our stretch goal section.\nPhoto Prints\nWe'll be printing 8\"x12\" photographs of the Dead King and Cryovern artwork, and our artists will sign them! You can find a higher resolution version to gander at on our website. We hope you like them as much as we do!\n  Role & Race Sponsorships\nAt the end of the campaign our Diplomats and Wardens will select either a role or race (depending on the pledge selected). These may be selected from the unlocked OR locked lists. If the selection is from the locked list, this hero will be added to the game for everyone. They will become the sponsor for this hero and their name will be added to the Thank You backers sheet as the hero's sponsor.\nItem Creation\nAt the end of the campaign, our Smugglers will work closely with us to create a unique item for purchase or acquisition in the game. They'll select the function and suggest a name and we'll work with them to make the item a reality.\nThe Forests of Adrimon (Beta Version)\nOur follow up to The Valley of the Dead King is currently in the tinkering phase of production. We have a working map and several interesting augmentations to the rules planned. Our Seers will obtain the beta version and will have the chance to provide feedback.\n  Interested in more stuff? Check out these addons we\u2019ve prepared for the campaign. How do addons work? If you\u2019re interested in purchasing any of these extras, simply add the amount shown below to your pledge during the checkout process.\nExtra Games: $54 per game\nInterested in purchasing more than 1 game? We've decided to take $5 off each extra that you purchase. Each additional game costs $54.\nAll Heroes + 6 sided dice: $30 per game\nInterested in upgrading your game to include ALL of the Roles and Races we've prepared? Now you can do so. This add-on INCLUDES the six-sided die upgrade (which will help us organize the number of products we're creating). \nYour box will now contain 1 set of each hero in the game. Please be advised that as we reach our final stretch goals, the number of Roles & Races in the core game will increase.\nThe price of this addon includes the added cost of limited production runs (which is higher due to smaller print numbers) and the additional artwork required to put all of the Roles in the box. We hope that you consider this an investment in the product to help power up the brand and enhance your play experience.\n6 Extra 6-sided Dice: $6\nHEXplore It comes with one 6-sided die. This die is shared between all players and is generally not rolled at the same time during the game. We\u2019ve played hundreds of games, and have found that you only need one six-sided die to play. However, we\u2019re excited to offer more. The six-sided die that ships with the game features a unique hex digit and won\u2019t be available elsewhere.\nLimited to one set of 6 dice per backer. This addon cannot be combined with the Extra Heroes addon shown above.\nStudio Canvas Print: $75\nCheck out these premium canvas prints of the Dead King and Cryovern! Each canvas costs $75. The prints are sized 11\" tall by 16.5\" wide x 1\" thick. Each print comes ready to hang on the wall. \nYou will have the option of receiving the print with your game (which will reduce or eliminate the shipping cost) or in a separate shipment before the game arrives. If you choose to receive the print before the game ships, you'll be responsible for the shipping cost. \nThe exclusive card that was originally available with each canvas is now included in the base game and will not ship with the canvases.\n             Retailers\nThank you for your checking out the first installment of HEXplore It.

I know there will be challenges ahead of varying scope. \n\nI've done a great deal of research and feel prepared for whatever hiccups we might encounter. The wealth of information that Jamey Stegmaier has provided in his Kickstarter lessons have been very insightful! A very heart-felt thank you to you Jamey!\n\nI've prepared two production scenarios to ensure you'll receive the best product. Obviously our goal is to get you the most polished product we can. \n\nThe greatest risk to this campaign are delays in getting the final product to you within the time frame we're planning. Many projects tend to draw on much longer than project creators anticipate. To help reduce production delays, our goal is to finalize the production files for printing within 3 months of the Kickstarter's completion.\n\nIn conclusion, I have researched dozens of Kickstarter projects, several of which were successful and similarly several of which have failed. I can tell you now none of us are sure how this project will evolve. But our promise is this: we will be here the entire time to address concerns and issues as they crop up. \n\nPersonally, I've backed campaigns that were less than punctual in getting back to their backers and I hated it. I promise to keep you informed. Your pledge symbolizes trust. I've created this project because I am excited, and my hope is that you've backed this project for the same reason. I will do my very best to ensure that excitement continues throughout this journey.\n\nI am very grateful to you, for considering this project and for placing your trust in me.

Are you ready to see what might really be going on inside our insides?\nIn February 2016, we introduced Kickstarter and the world to Book 1 of our quirky concept. Now, we've returned to continue the adventures of college student Morgan as his body parts struggle to keep him alive, find purpose in life, and work together as a community. The great thing about this series is each book is a stand-alone story. You don't have to read Book 1 to understand what's going on in Book 2!\nIn Book 1 (40 pages of story), we saw Morgan's brain operator, Bran, and penis operator, Pepe, go head-to-head for control of Morgan's decision-making, all while Morgan battled the pressure to end a dry spell. You can enjoy a 15-page preview of Book 1 here!\nIn Book 2 (also 40 pages of story), things remain equally embarrassing, hilarious and awkward for Morgan. Except this time, we're exploring different body elements. Check out the Book 2 preview below! And make sure to check out our rewards options.\n            That's right, Morgan is in a sticky situation yet again. And if you've read Book 1, you know we'll deliver on that promise. Here's a couple more pages in progress.\n    Morgan's Organs is the wild brain child of me - Daniel Brodie - AKA Canadian #1. I'm excited to continue to partner with the incredibly talented artist, Robert Jennex - AKA Canadian #2 - who's handling all art for the book. We're a small team, but we've done it before, and we're ready to do it again.\nLeft - Dan; Right - Rob\nWe have exciting guest artists who've drawn beautiful rewards for this campaign. See the REWARDS section to check out what they produced.\nBenjamin Mackey, co-creator of the Image Comics series, SAINTS. His poster \"Last Supper\" is available at the \"ORGANISM\" tier.\nGreg Merritt, Canadian artist. His poster \"Incredible Meats\" is available at the \"ORGANISM\" tier.\nStady One, German illustrator, who drew the Book 2 collector's sleeve available at the \"ORGAN\" tier.\nThis series focuses on Morgan as he navigates everyday college life, which is made difficult by the fact that he isn't completely \"human\". Inside his body lives a variety of organ-like characters (called organauts) who control his various body systems and ultimately, are keeping him alive. The problem is these organauts don't always operate with the best interests of their host in mind.\nThe stories take place on two levels. Outside, we follow Morgan and his group of friends as they navigate college life. Zoom into his insides and we see how Morgan's struggles are made worse by a group of organ operators who bicker, lie, cheat, argue, act selfish, and generally, don't work together as one community.\nSay cheese!\n  Make sure to read the below highlights about our rewards.\nOnto the REWARDS!\nBelow is a snapshot of the various reward tiers and the added item available at each tier. You can also click the below image to read a PDF version. See the REWARDS tab for full details of what's available at each tier.\nClick to view PDF version\n  I believe in complete transparency because I don't see this as a business - not yet, at least. These campaigns are part of my long-term vision to have Morgan's Organs picked up by a publisher, and eventually made as a television series. All of my rewards are priced appropriately to cover exactly what I need to support this vision. That means covering artist salary, production (including printing), and packaging/shipping.\nIn the KS campaign for Book 1, we raised ~$5,500 from over 175 backers (140% of funding goal). As I committed to spending up to $1,000 CAD of my own money on this project (if needed), I invested in a larger print run of Book 1 which drove down the per-unit-cost and created the opportunity to grow readership. I also invested in an Artist Alley booth at Toronto's Fan Expo 2016, where I was able to bring in many more interested fans. Overall, my personal spending on Book 1 was about $700 CAD.\nI pay my artist what I am able, but we both have a mutual understanding this is a partnership and we're investing in a long-term vision. For Book 1, Rob received about $3,700 for all project work. This included a bonus payment for all his hard work after the entire project was done, based on what I could afford.\nFor this book, Rob will be receiving about $4,000, and if we're able to exceed our campaign goal by enough, I hope to increase his page rate further. I will invest up to $1,250 CAD of my own money into this project above what is raised, whether it goes towards printing, artist costs, or having a booth at an upcoming event.\nOur Kickstarter goal of $4,000 CAD supports the below:\n60% = artist salary\n30% = the 4P's - printing / production / packaging / parceling (shipping)\n10% = Kickstarter fees\nEverything raised above this goal will go to a combination of:\nAdditional printing (further driving down per-unit-cost and creating opportunity to invest in our stretch goal rewards)\nIncreasing artist salary\nConvention booths at 2017 Toronto Fan Expo and perhaps more!\nThis isn't just another comic book; it's a long-term vision. I have over 15 future stories planned (and counting), plus spin-off versions of the concept. The end goal is to produce Morgan's Organs as a television show, but until then, we'll continue to make great books, grow our audience, and look at the human body in weird, wacky ways! Thank you for helping us achieve our dream!\nPepe gives you approval to back this campaign!\n  Hey, what are you doing all the way down here? Still not convinced this book is right for you? Then read some of the past coverage we've received on Book 1 of the series!\nComic Crusaders - 5/5 star rating - \"Daniel lays out a wonderful story that I, no WE, need to read more of! The art is great, Robert brings to life the world of Morgan\u2019s organs with a clean, animated style.\"\nComixBrew - \"Morgan\u2019s Organs is the kind of comic that is good to show your buddies for the laughs but also contains a deceptive amount of depth.\"\nComic Plug - \"Morgan\u2019s Organs is like Inside Out if it were written by Seth McFarlane.\"\nComic Unknown - \"If you ever wondered how Inside Out would have worked through the eyes of a male college student, look no more. Morgan's Organs is a gut-busting comedy that while the idea has been seen before, it is the fresh take we need and want.\"\nOther Worlds Than These - \"The main thing this book really has going for it is the fact it\u2019s laugh out loud funny in places. It\u2019s also intelligently written and brings out real nostalgia.\"\nThe Outhousers - \"The delightfully cartoonish art and exploration of maturity help [Morgan's Organs] defy expectations. It's a satisfying read for those that love thoughtful comedy.\"", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have the experience from running a Kickstarter campaign for Book 1 to know how to deliver on our promise.

There are options for competitive, cooperative, and solo play!\nAt the start of the game, each player drafts his or her own team of four heroes and uses tactical movement and cardplay to overcome the dungeon's monsters and acquire treasures. Rival teams may compete with one another to slay monsters, or even battle one another for complete domination. \nOnly one Dungeon Alliance will prove victorious!\nDungeon Alliance may be played with or without player-vs-player combat at the players' discretion.  \n    Initial Goal - Funded!!\n  Unlocked!\n  Unlocked!\n  Unlocked!\n  Unlocked!\n  Soundly Defeated... and Unlocked!\n  Every copy of Dungeon Alliance includes:\n17 Hero Miniatures\n16 Colored Snap-On Bases\n25 Dungeon Tiles\n12 Board Frame Pieces\n17 Hero Cards\n51 Starting Deck Cards\n32 Generic Starting Cards (Basic Game)\n76 Upgrade Cards\n8 Reference Cards\n16 Solo / Cooperative Play Cards\n23 Encounter Cards\n64 Encounter Tokens\n40 Wound Tokens (Wood)\n208 Miscellaneous Tokens\n4 Draft Bonus Charts\n1 Dungeon Die\n12 Quest Cards (NEW!)\n12+ Campaign Tokens (NEW!)\n  We have now unlocked the Stretch Goal for the Deck of Many Treasures! Here are some details on how it will work:\nThe Deck of Many Treasures will be a separate deck of cards.\nWhenever a Hero opens a Treasure Chest or Locked Chest, he or she will have the option of either just receiving XP as normal, or \"digging deeper\" into the chest for an additional reward.\nIf a Hero pushes their luck by digging deeper, they will draw one of three types of cards:\nMagic Item: The Hero discovers a one-shot magical item that they can choose to use once per game. This card goes into the Alliance Deck, and is discarded immediately after use.\nTrap!: The Hero springs a trap. The Hero will have the opportunity to disarm the trap (rolling the Dungeon Die and using any special cards that help) to earn XP. If the Hero fails, they suffer the effects of the trap.\nMimic: The treasure chest springs to life and attacks! If the Hero can defeat the Mimic, he or she earns bonus XP. Otherwise, it will attack any Hero who approaches it for the rest of the game.\nWe can't wait for you to enjoy this exciting new feature that has been added to the Champions of Dungeon Alliance Expansion! As a Kickstarter Backer, it's yours for free the day you receive your game!\n  Thanks to the feedback of the Dungeon Alliance Community, we have added 12 Quest Cards that create an alternate source of XP during the game, as well as a way to earn Campaign Points that players can use to increase the strength of their dungeon parties over the course of several adventures!\nQuest Cards also provide a Win / Loss Condition for solo and cooperative games for those players who prefer an extra level of challenge!\nQuest Cards\nWe have included these new components and rules to the base game of Dungeon Alliance at no additional cost to backers! If the Kickstarter Campaign reaches its first goal, every copy of the game will include these new components.\n  Every Kickstarter backer receives the Champions of Dungeon Alliance Expansion for free! For a limited time, this expansion will only be available to Kickstarter backers. \nThe Champions of Dungeon Alliance Expansion includes the Hero Figures, Hero Cards, and Starting Deck Cards for four new Heroes, and also includes several new Upgrades. As we reach Stretch Goals, we may add even more elements to the expansion! But no matter how big it gets, it's all yours for FREE right now!\nBartholomew, Sonja, Kulldrak, and Taio\nYou will receive everything that ends up in the first expansion, except for the printed expansion box and rulebook. The rulebook will be downloadable to all backers in PDF format.\n  Every Kickstarter Backer will receive exclusive Epic Hero versions of the heroes from the game. Players who have drafted many cards for their favorite heroes can switch their Hero Cards out for these alternate art versions as a sign of the heroes' progress.\nAlthough these exclusive cards do not change the gameplay of Dungeon Alliance, they add a new level of immersion to the game. These Epic Hero cards are a special thank-you to our backers and will never be available after the Kickstarter campaign (except for charity events).\nAt the start of the campaign, there will be 5 Epic Hero Cards available for free to all backers. As we reach stretch goals, we will commission more art to add more free cards to the exclusive set!\nUPDATE: We have accomplished our first four Stretch Goals, and so now all 21 Epic Hero Cards have been unlocked and are included in the Kickstarter version of Dungeon Alliance!\nEpic Melinda, Jypzy, Petra, Taio, and Holgar\n    Our Dungeon Champion Pledge Level ($120) includes a full set of painted miniatures.

We begin with the Spanish text versions of the Rulebook and Rules Supplement\nDungeon Alliance Rulebook (Spanish)\nDungeon Alliance Rules Supplement (Spanish)\nForm Your Alliance\nAt the start of the game, each player drafts his or her own alliance of four heroes. This allows players to customize the type of team they'd like to play.\nYou will receive the Hero Card, Hero Figure, and 3 unique Starting Deck Cards associated with each of your heroes. Together, all 12 of your Starting Deck Cards form the basis of your personal Alliance Deck. Because of this, each player begins with a completely different Alliance Deck at the start of the game.\nBuild Your Deck\nAs you defeat monsters and overcome challenges, you will earn Experience Point Tokens (XP). You can flip these XP Tokens face down to purchase Upgrade Cards for your Alliance Deck.\nConquer the Dungeon!\nDuring each cycle of the game round, you will activate one of your heroes to move and attack monsters on the dungeon map. You will then have the opportunity to spend XP to purchase new upgrade cards that will go directly into your hand.\nAfter each of your opponents has moved a hero, you will each control one monster on the board to strike back at the heroes. The players control the monsters so that the monster attacks will be both strategic and meaningful.\nThere are four play cycles to each game round, after which the current round ends and the next round begins. At the end of the fourth game round, the Alliance that has acquired the most XP Tokens wins!\n    Our two main packages, Dungeon Ally ($80) and Dungeon Champion ($120), ship anywhere in the world.

We have 12 years of experience working with printers and resolving these sorts of issues, so we are fully prepared to face such difficulties if they arise.\n\nFor board games, a publisher on Kickstarter must also carefully calculate the shipping costs from the warehouse to the individual customers, or else they will face the possibility that they have not raised enough money to cover these expenses. We have made these calculations for shipping to our customers throughout the world.\n\nIn addition, in order for the game to be \"EU friendly,\" we will be shipping copies to our customers in the European Union from our printer's headquarters in Germany.

You and up to five friends are cave explorers who have become trapped deep underground. You must quickly explore a tile-based cave system, utilise your character's specialist skills and carefully manage your actions to find the way out before your flashlights die and you're lost in the darkness forever.  \nYou'll need to work together to overcome deadly subterranean hazards - stick together for safety, or split up to cover more ground. One wrong step could knock you unconscious and your friends will need to stage a rescue. Light and hope are scarce. And worst of all, you don't think you're alone down here...\n Looking for the Stretch Goal announcements?\n  Let's descend...\n        Check out the how to play video below (courtesy of Toucan Play that Game), which outlines the game setting, objectives, gameplay and some strategies for attempting your escape!\nSub Terra is a team-based push-your-luck game. Together, you'll decide what risks are worth taking and when. The caves is a dangerous place - no matter how well you plan, things WILL go wrong, and your survival depends on how well you react to unforeseen circumstances.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE: Escape the cave before you run out of time.\n1) CAVERS: Everyone picks a caver, and gives that caver 3 health points. There are eight characters to choose from in Sub Terra - each has unique abilities that change how they play\n2) TILES: Cavers begin the game on the START TILE. You're all trying to get to the EXIT TILE, which is near the bottom of the TILE STACK.\n3) ACTIONS: Every round, each caver has two action points to spend (and can risk a health point for a third) \nThe basic actions are: \nReveal (Flip the top tile of the stack and place it a gap next to your current location) \nMove (Move to an adjacent connected tile) \nExplore (Reveal a tile, then immediately Move onto it. Faster, but riskier!) \nHeal (You or another caver on your tile regains one health point)\nRun (Move three times) \nTogether, you must place tiles as quickly as possible while not getting too spread out. Why not run off by yourself? Well\u2026\n4) HAZARDS: At the end of each round, resolve the top card of the HAZARD DECK. Each affects a certain type of tile: cavers on those tiles will lose health, and the tile may become harder to traverse. For example, GAS hurts cavers on GAS TILES a medium amount, whereas a FLOOD hurts those on WATER TILES only a little but makes the tile twice as costly to enter in the future.\n If you lose all your health points, you fall UNCONSCIOUS - you're unable to take further actions until another caver reaches your tile and HEALS you. If a friend is nearby, this won't take long. If you've strayed too far down a side passage, it might take some time to reach you. Why does that matter? Well\u2026\n5) RUNNING OUT OF TIME: When the hazard deck runs out of cards, your flashlights are nearly out of power: instead of resolving a card, each caver has a chance of getting lost in the darkness forever. Turns are precious - time spent rescuing fallen cavers or backtracking through difficult passages is time you'd rather spend uncovering more tiles and getting closer to the exit.\n6) HORRORS: You're not alone down here. Some hazard cards can spawn...things...which will relentlessly hunt you down. If they catch you, you'll immediately lose all health points and fall unconscious. If you try to fight them, you will die. RUN.\n7) MORE STUFF: Sub Terra also contains: cave-ins, squeezes, ledges, slides, ropes, rough treacherous terrain, tremors, dynamite, cave diving, \"geology\" and soul-crushing despair \n(soul-crushing despair supplied separately)\nEager to play Sub Terra?

I.e. if you want add-ons that total \u00a320, add \u00a320 to the amount of your base pledge!\n\nIf you want to include add-ons when you first make your pledge, then simply manually edit the amount shown when you make the pledge to increase the number to include your add-ons. \n                     Making games can be pretty expensive, but the more we make, each one gets cheaper to produce. Instead of pocketing the extra cash, we, like many other Kickstarter creators, invest that value back into the project to make everyone's games better, bigger, and more terrifying!\n\nClick the graphic below to see all the amazing stuff we've unlocked already!\nGot an idea for a stretch goal, an add-on, or anything else for the campaign?\nClick below to add your ideas!\n  We've got a great shipping system set up ready for Sub Terra backers, utilising a combination of Chinese, Hong Kong and British freight handling and shipping agents, meaning that we can offer really competitive rates to EVERYONE, not just the UK and US.\n\nWe're offering EU, US, Canadian, and Australian friendly shipping, meaning no customs duties or taxes to deal with when your game arrives. We handle all that for you, and as it costs us less that way - we can offer even better rates to you!\n\n      Behind the fear and anxiety of the world of Sub Terra has been a dedicated team, who together have brought the vision of a beautiful, balanced and challenging survival horror game to fruition.

The team is poised!\n\nMANUFACTURE:\nWe're partnering with Whatz games from Shanghai, the team behind Iello's manufacturing, they're fast, reliable and produce high quality games. We're confident they'll produce a box that helps us deliver the Sub Terra experience. I will personally review the blank samples, the pre-production samples, and if the budget permits, visit the factory itself to inspect the production run.\n\nFREIGHT & SHIPPING:\nWe're working with a specially honed team of fulfillment and shipping experts, in Hong Kong, Shanghai, the UK and elsewhere to ensure that we can offer leading backer shipping rates as well as deliver you your games speedily and in good condition. We're aiming to get a chunk of games once manufactured to the UK Games Expo in June, so we're aiming to get shipping on the go before then. November is our worst case scenario. We may obviously sell copies of the game at the UKGE before some backers get their copy elsewhere in the world. We're hoping that this doesn't happen but we want to be upfront, we can't afford as a small publisher to not take that opportunity.\n\nHORRORS:\nThere's a small chance the darkness will close in on the ITB team and the horrors will catch up to us. If this happens, we may not be able to ship your game, as we'll probably have been eaten.

After its Steam, Xbox One and VR releases, SUPERHOT is taking its unique game mechanics to the world of tabletop games. SUPERHOT THE CARD GAME was designed with love of the source material, and with meticulous attention to all the details that make SUPERHOT so amazing. The game will be produced in Poland using the highest quality materials, with assistance from our tried and true production partners.\nThe mechanics of this card game are based on a well-known and award-winning Print and Play game \u201cAgent Decker\u201d, also created by Manuel Correia. \nAn ultra-portable deck of just 75 cards will be all you need to transport yourself and your friends into the visually stunning, beautifully brutal world of SUPERHOT.\nHand-crafted, micro-deckbuilding mechanics will immerse you in the ever-changing, visceral, and iconic fight sequences of SUPERHOT. Every turn and every move is an intense snapshot of lethal combat frozen in motion. Your decisions and your execution dictate the pace of the game. Daredevil maneuvers and risk-taking can reward you greatly or exact harsh punishment.\nEvery card you play advances the timeline. You shoot a guy\u2019s head off. Enemies pour into the room. A shower of bullets fills the air. The clock is ticking.\n  What makes a good FPS? Well, we think it's the dynamic gameplay that constantly keeps you on the edge of your seat with all of its sudden twists and turns. We think that SUPERHOT The Card Game has it all, and we think to truly understand the gameplay, you need to see it in action. Here's a quick video to give you a preview of some of SUPERHOT The Card Game's mechanics.\n         In this clever card game you will face a line of enemies moving your way. Make the most of your hand of cards, using items and your location to your advantage. In this intense puzzle of moves and plays, a dynamic strategy is key to survival. \nTake on the line of enemies. When you defeat a foe, their card will be added to your hand and made available for use on your next turn. Observe your surroundings, react, and create a set of events that will leave you alone standing.\nThe cards you play hasten or slow down movements of the enemy line. Depending on what cards are in front of you, the pace will change. That\u2019s something you want to keep an eye on, especially when bullets start flying! \nYour deck and the enemy deck are the heart of the game. The cards cycle between them, and it is up to you to control this movement. Choose the cards you play strategically, as they will end up in the enemy deck, and remember that the cards you go through, end up in yours. Knowing when and what to play is the key. Learn to manipulate time, create sequences of moves, observe what\u2019s in front of you, and what might appear\u2026\nEach play experience will pit you against 3 levels; in each of which you must defeat the security system by acquiring a particular combination of Goal Cards in order to push on. Every time you play the game it will challenge you with a different, randomly generated set of requirements for success. That means no two games will ever feel the same. You will have to adapt to an ever changing situation and play your hand just right to outsmart your adversary. Every round will be a fight for survival against the relentless system that wants to see you fail!\nDid you think that was it? Definitely not! Get ready for a vast array of challenges that we've prepared for you. Each one of them comes with a unique badge and puts your abilities of planning and time management to the test. Try to get as many as you can and don't let the security system beat you!\n Here's what reviewers are saying about SUPERHOT: The Card Game!\n           Not enough intel to set out on a mission in our sizzling hot game? Have no fear! For those who like to be prepared for everything, we have a written manual that will guide you through every nook and cranny of the amazing game mechanics.\n  But will all this be enough to get you through the army of red dudes? Well, if you have your doubts go on and give it a try \u2013 play the SOLO mode on Tabletopia!\n          Play alone, or invite your friends and get SUPERHOT together\nYou can dive into SUPERHOT The Card Game in Single Player Mode the moment you open the box. It\u2019s challenging, it\u2019s dynamic and it\u2019s rewarding. Scenarios chock-full of lethal puzzles and daredevil risk-taking will give your wits and focus a run for their money. The game will leave you exhilarated every time you prevail, completing a mercilessly difficult action sequence leaving you the last one standing. \nOnce you\u2019re done, you\u2019re ready to play other modes, to teach your friends, and to spread the system!\nCompete with a friend, as one of you takes control of the game system, to influence the ultraviolent world of SUPERHOT. Will a whole new array of tricks be enough to overwhelm, outsmart and utterly dominate a human opponent?\nIf you\u2019re not the competitive type, try joining forces in a two-player cooperative mode. You'll have to work together every step of the way, as one poor decision could spell the end for your campaign.\nDo you have one more to join in? Then play a three player mixed mode, and feel the deep, dark satisfaction of dominating two opponents at the same time. Three\u2019s a crowd? Destroy them both, or work hand in hand with a mate to take down that sociopathic friend of yours, who would dedicate their time and focus to one thing only: to see you both crash and burn. \n                Because it\u2019s\u2026 \nSUPER \nHOT \nSTUFF!!\n1.

What more it's water proof, very light and easy to transport!\n      If you are interested in getting even more SUPERHOT stuff, check out our add-ons we've prepared for you. If you see something you like, simply edit/increase your pledge by the required amount, and after the campaign select the appropriate items in the Pledge Manager.\n        Shipping time for worldwide destinations is about 4 weeks for economic tracked postage. \nSince all parcels will be sent from Poland, shipping costs for backers from this country will be half the normal price. \nPlease note that shipping will be paid after the Kickstarter campaign ends, from the Pledge Manager. Prices are final for all named pledge levels. But please remember that if you add more stuff in Pledge Manager, shipping prices might slightly change, depending on how many add-ons, games or extra items you want to get. \nEstimated shipping costs for: \nUSA - $6 - $8.5 (for single pledge)\nCanada - $6.5 - $12 (for single pledge)\nPoland - $3 - $4 (all pledges)\nEurope - $5 - $10 (Katana) and $8.5 - $15 (Shotgun)\nYou can find the detailed costs here:\n  Also, if you come from a country with limited postal access, there might be an additional fee required. VAT tax for European Union is included in the price and because of no VAT tax regulations for countries outside of EU we are able to offer cheaper shipping prices.\nPlease also remember that you can pick up your pledge at one of the events we will attend this year AT NO SHIPPING COST. In 2017 we will be at - UK Games Expo, GenCon, and Spiel (Essen)!\nIf you have any questions - just send them to us!\n    Our team is young, creative, and very intelligent with a lot of cool ideas. We have worked with Manuel since Spiel2015 and so far we are enjoying it greatly. What is more, we are planning even more projects together, so that shows how we appreciate this cooperation and Manuel's way of thinking and working. Besides, he is just as crazy as we are ;)\nSo far, we have published Multiuniversum and Multiuniversum: Project Cthulhu designed by Manuel, and these two titles are our best sellers. And now it\u2019s time for SUPERHOT The Card Game to join the fray :)\nBoard&Dice Publishing, let\u2019s call us BaD Squad, is mostly run by three geeks fully engaged in games that we intend to publish.\nFor us, board games are something more than merely an idea for a business. Most of all, they are our great passion, which enables us to develop ourselves in several areas at the same time. Since we are a small Polish publishing firm we can publish games that are to our liking and that we find interesting. That is, the ones we'd love to play ourselves.\nTo make the long story short \u2013 we publish games that fascinate us. Such was the case with Beer Empire or Dice Brewing which reflected our love for brewing, or with Exoplanets which mirrors our huge interest in the cosmos and the laws governing our universe. And of course there is SUPERHOT The Card Game. We thought this idea was amazing from the beginning, with mechanics we fell for instantly and the crazy promise of turning the original SUPERHOT into a sick card game!\nYou should also know that it isn\u2019t our first Crowdfunding campaign. We ran a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2015 for the board game Exoplanets, and in the same year we also funded another of our games, The Curse of The Black Dice, on a Polish crowdfunding portal. We've got experience in carrying out international projects, so we can assure you that the games will reach your hands without delays.\nWe are fully invested in every title we publish, not only in terms of promotion or production, but we also support authors in the optimization and perfection of their ideas.\nThe staff of Board&Dice consists of six positively crazed individuals. BaD crew core:\n Numbers, licensing, sales and executive director.\n Crazy creative soul in our team. Game hunter, designer and developer.\n He is working with publishers to make sure that games look best possible.\n This guy coordinates logistics and takes care of your games packaging.\nSale support, managing customer relations and responsible for the Pledge Manager configuration.\nTranslation bot. Whenever he translates a piece of text, there's a chance English will come out... and make sense sometimes.\nThis guy supports our technical stuff, and all the things that need his tech-magic.\nHexy Studio - A perfect combination of passion and energy of real artists with knowledge and experience of game industry veterans. We offer you integrated project solutions, from advertising and publishing to miniature production and game development.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs Board&Dice we have experience in international sales and delivery of games to Europe, North America and Asian countries (distribution of Dice Brewing, Exoplanets, Multiuniversum \u2013 base game, and Multiuniversum Project: Cthulhu). What is more, we are selling other publishers' games worldwide, so we can assure you that after the period indicated in the campaign your Backed games will be delivered to your hands. Some of the components are already in our warehouses, some have been quoted and the suppliers have undertaken obligations with regard to delivery dates, so all deadlines presented in the campaign are real and compliant with our and our partners\u02bc abilities.\n\nSUPERHOT The Card Game is almost finished in gameplay and graphic design. It is also in testing phase here in Poland and with author's test groups in Germany. \n\nSUPERHOT The Card Game was scrutinised by very demanding and experienced bloggers and testers who have publicly spoken about it in various media (we\u02bcre happy, because most of their opinions were very positive :) ). That\u02bcs why we believe that SUPERHOT The Card Game is finished in every tiny detail and the only thing left is the production and delivery of purchased items.\n\nIn order to guarantee the highest quality, we decided that the game will be printed by one of our most important partners which has been operating on the international market for a long time and guarantees the proper engagement and support for us (he works with Portal Games as well). \n\nAdditionally, we\u02bcve already planned the logistics behind deliveries and have acquired an International Partner who allows us to deliver packages worldwide. On the other hand, Europe is the area in which we\u02bcre successfully executing deliveries of games to our partners, shops or directly to players buying items from our web store on a daily basis.\n\nThis long description is our way to tell you that the campaign and game itself is well prepared and we\u02bcve already spent several long months working on it. SUPERHOT The Card Game was in our plans since last year.\n\nIf you have any questions for us or have any doubts then don\u02bct hesitate to contact us.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Punch", "descp": "If you just want to be with us!\nSupport SUPERHOT THE CARD GAME and we will send you an e-postcard with a beautiful illustration from the world of SUPERHOT, along with 2 high-resolution desktop wallpapers.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2017"}], "stat": ["47 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Baseball bat", "descp": "A minifigure for your collection!

These structures bring an alternative game mode in which cities and space stations can be built, which change the original game with their greatly effective abilities.    \nPlanet Mars: After the Terran Empire bombarded Mars down, the circumstances changed on the planet. The Admiral edition contains a totally new board, which has impassable territories. Mars also means an alternative game mode in addition to the normal gameplay.  \nElite troops: These are special forces which were trained to destroy their target before it could initiate fire. The Admiral edition adds one set of elite troop for each faction, which is special in the sense that - in opposition to the normal units - it does not get to the recovery ship after attacking. The double add-on gift brings you an other set of elite troops, the more you rule the stronger your army is.\n  See Update #13!\nThe Alien pack costs $18 and the Big minor pack costs $15, together is only $30, and you will get 2 additional gifts along. The add-ons don't have separate boxes, they will be shipped together with the game in the basic box (Admiral or Captain). To add one or more add-ons to your pledge, simply increase your pledge by that amount and the rest will be sorted during the Pledge Manager. When you take the double-hex, you can get the double add-ons in all boxes for a discounted $300 price.\nYou have plenty of time to think about it, as you can add the add-ons in the Pledge Manager after the end of the campaign as well.\n          REVIEWS\n             Which faction will YOU join?\n    The Ox\nAfter humanity initiated longer voyages into space in the first half of the 21st century, they soon met the ancient and gentle people of Oxes. But human nature tend to dominate and exploit: Oxes found themselves soon in the depths of the hexilium mines, where their unmatched strength, stamina and tranquility resulted in amazingly productive harvest of the precious material. The people, who called themselves xhladtkom in their own language, got the \"Ox\" cognomen, because humans treated them like farmers treated the oxen. As long and hard decades passed, some brave Oxes tried to break out of the quasi slave yoke, but as humans could deal with these cases in isolation, no significant mass revolts could be organized. At least until recent times, when a new Ox leader decided to end this situation once and for all time. Slowly, they began to modify and arm their miner ships. The war of 2242 brought them the opportunity they were waiting for a long time...\nThe Mentacle\nMany rumors were spreading that in the universe growing by the rapid expansion of humans, there were some territories where alien races were spotted. But these were not confirmed by anyone except the oxes, despite the photos and other documents, because these were called hoaxes and conspiration theories, and some well-paid scientists could bring up some credibly looking contra arguments. Still, by the 23rd century most of the population was convinced that they exist. More and more rumors spread that the in the depths of the artificial labyrinths of distant moons\u2019 deep craters such enormous underground laboratories were constructed, where they have been experimenting on aliens for a long time. Moreover, some scientists ran hazardous gene manipulation experiments in order to cross aliens and humans: to create a hybrid that has exceeding mental abilities. These rumors were naturally not confirmed officially by the true financial supporters like the Union of Trade Worlds, on the contrary, they fiercely denied them. Then, in 2245 something happened that changed the official standpoint quickly: tricking their creators, many hundreds of Mentacles escaped from the research facilities, conquering some outer planet, thus gaining control of a greater fleet. Their intentions are unknown...\nWHAT MAKES HEXPANSE SPECIAL?\nSimple rules with tactical depth - although quick to learn the basics, the players face tough choices each turn. \nDynamic gameplay - in the short turns you can pull of powerful combos with the mercenary and action cards.\nPattern building - pays homage to great abstract classics while delivering something completely different. \nSmart and beautiful graphics - the compact layout of the game board both feasts the eye and greatly reduces setup time.\nVariability - thanks to the 12 mission cards and 9 minor factions the game plays differently almost every time.\nRulebook\nYou can check the fairly complete rulebook right here.\n Why back now?  \nGet it first - copies will ship to Kickstarter backers way before the game hits the shop. \nLimited availability - the game will be printed in limited quantities based on the final number of backers.\nCheaper for backers - the game is estimated to go for around $65 MSRP, depending on unlocked stretch goals. Shipping is also heavily subsidised for you. \nHelp us make it better - the stretch goals we could not afford without your collective support will be included in the game. \nLeave your mark for eternity - there are addons and pledge levels for which we will actually include your name or your portrait in the final version of the game. \nWe can\u2019t do it without you - we\u2019ve paid for the development, art, graphic design, but we cannot print and ship without you.\nShipping will be charged after the campaign through PledgeManager.\nYou can add more copies by simply increasing your pledge. Shipping will be charged only once. \n*  You will not pay extra duty or taxes for packages delivered to AU and CA. One copy will not be charged anything, guaranteed. Pick up in Budapest is free!\nThe game is based on a system of icons, so neither the character sheets nor the cards contain any texts, so the game is not language dependent. The only language dependent element is the rulebook. The game contains an English guide, and according to our offer, any country/language that reaches 100 backers will get a rulebook in their own language, which will be available online as downloadable content. And if the number of backers will be increasing to 300, we would prepare a printed version, too.\nKorona Games, INC. is a game publishing company based on Florida. \nOur customers are our #1 focus! \nYou can always count on friendly and prompt service and communication.

We made contracts with the delivery services and the printing presses, trusting the success of the game, so we could start producing and sending the game as soon as the project is finished.\nIs there a way to purchase other games of the publisher?Of course there is. The games are available at the www.kekjatek.hu website. As these games are not purchased through Kickstarter as an add-on, these orders work with different shipping. Please contact us in email. \nWhat will be the size of the cards in the game?\nThere will be one card size in Hexpanse: 88 x 63 mm\nWhat is the difference between the Admiral's Editions of the games and the standard editions?\nThe Admiral\u2019s Edition of games have numbered boxes and contains the following elements, that the basic version does not: Planet Mars game board, 5 structures and cards, Elite troops and special stretch goals. Other than that, they are functionally the same.\nIs possible for those who pledge Admiral edition to get it in blue box?\nIf you pledge Admiral, you will be able to choose in the pledge manager at the end of the campaign whether you want to receive it in Admiral (gold) or Captain (blue) box.\nWhat about shipping?\nThe most important thing that shipping cost will be charged after the campaign only. Some Kickstarter projects have different pledge levels for various outside-the-USA destinations. We have carefully researched shipping, both domestic and foreign, and come up with the following plan. We use different shipping for each country, you can check the prices by shipping issue.\nShipping is really expensive...\nYes it is. Sadly, our prices reflect real shipping rates, and for games of this weight, USA costs almost the same as Europe. Regarding to other destinations the advence prices are quite high, but it can be lower if plenty of people will back us from those countries. We hope so...\nIf I add additional copies to my order, do I have to pay the shipping price again for each new copy?\nNo, you don't! You only have to pay the shipping price once, then you may add more copies for the price indicated in the pledge level.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are a new company in the world market, but we are not new to board games.

To some it is just business, a way to earn money and increase the value of their company. It\u2019s a liquid which lets you achieve your business goals and turn ideas into money. To others it is passion, commitment, discovering new flavors, aromas and colors. It is some kind of alchemy that gives you the opportunity to stimulate the reserves of creativity and independence hidden deep inside of you...\nBut is there a truly right way to build your own Beer Empire? No\u2026 And you are not going to find it in this game either\u2026 Building the best Beer Empire requires focusing on several game elements at the same time and choosing the right strategy to achieve the goals you have set. Finally, the biggest Beer Empire will only be created when you combine the passion for brewing and the love for beer with business calculation, commitment to winning the most important markets, and a wise choice of the most suitable strategy.\nThere is nothing to wait for then! Take your aprons, agitator rods, bags of malt, baskets full of hops\u2026 It\u2019s time to open your own brewery and develop some unique recipes. It\u2019s time to build your own Beer Empire!\nWell, some people are simply masters at explaining rules and showing how to create your own beer from all the resources you can find in Beer Empire.\nSo we\u2019d like to invite you for the rules explanation of Beer Empire, with our Main Brewmaster Kuba Polkowski from polish game blog: Board Game Girl.\nWant more knowledge? Looking for specific beer recipes? You should check out our Brewer\u2019s Almanac \u2013 you will find there all important information:\n  More? You need to practice your brewing skills? Ok, we also have an option for you:\n  More visualizations from Tabletopia?\n                  Polyhedron Collider Kickstarter review - click here.\nAnd also you can listen to Polyhedron Collider podcast with Beer Empire.\n    In an effort to meet the wishes of gamers from Poland as well as the tradition of our cooperation with the Polish crowdfunding platform Wspieram.to, we are launching there another project related to this one.\nWe have decided to create an opportunity for Polish backers to join you in the effort of backing this game. As soon as the game on Kickstarter and Wspieram.to gets funded, we will connect the collected amounts.\nWhat does it mean? The sum collected there will be displayed here and added to the sum from Kickstarter, which will result in reaching the subsequent stretch goals faster. So after reaching the main goals Polish Backers will be added to Kickstarter.\nWe know that this game can be created only thanks to all Backers support\u2026 So guys you all are essential to this campaign, and the game will only exist with your support.\nBackers and their opinions are very important to us! Your involvement motivates us, and we are here to listen to your opinions and ideas. We will try to answer each and every question in the comments or by private message! We will also try to create a unique mood here, like it was during our Exoplanets and Multiuniversum Kickstarter campaigns. \nYou will receive free add-on to your pledge: It will be available after Kickstarter in our webstore and our main partners and during special events, like Spiel, UK Games Expo, GenCon.\nYou will be among the first. You are our fan and backer, and we value your time and support, so we will do all that\u2019s humanly possible to ensure that you receive your game at the beginning of second quarter of 2017, of course before it will be available in North American or worldwide distribution \u2013 you will be first players with this game in your hands! \nYou will have the possibility to get all the stretch goals and Kickstarter exclusives! \nThe Kickstarter add-ons won\u2019t be available in retail for free. \nYou are helping us to reach the worldwide market! Not only European but worldwide! Thanks to you and your support, our game can reach players all over the world!\n  Stickers as a add-on!\nSize of this stickers will be 5x4cm and we will add 8 caps stickers (2 in each player color) in diameter: 2,3cm.\nAdd-ons are in two variants:\nFirst - LITE for $2- files prepared for print and you can do it all by your own. Second - FULL for $4 - we will print it and add to your copy of Beer Empire game.\nHow to get them?\nJust increase your pledge by $2/$4 And everything else will be done at Pledge Manager\nWhat add-on can you expect for free in all pledges? \nWhat lots of people asked for: an additional beer tile along with 2 extra market tiles and a new beer reviewer. This Kickstarter add-on content will be a new punchboard that all backers will receive along with the funded game.\nShipping costs for economic tracked postage takes about 4 weeks to ship worldwide.\nSince all parcels will be sent from Poland, shipping price for backers from this country will be half of normal price.\nPlease note that shipping will be paid after the Kickstarter campaign ends, from the Pledge Manager. Prices are not final and might slightly change in the Pledge Manager, depending on how many stretch goals we will unlock.\nEstimated shipping costs for:\nUSA - $13 (for single game)\nCanada - $17,5 (for single game)\nEurope - $9 - $15 (single game and main destinations)\n  And one more important element here\nWell, we know that there is a lot of time till UK Games Expo in 2017... But if that can help and eliminate your shipping costs, we will bring your Beer Empire to Birmingham and you will be able to pick it up there - it's really up to you :)\n    * We have decided to open this stretch goal in level of 85% of main goal to give you guys a chance to add now this small, extra paid add-on - only $5 and it can help us to reach the main goal a little bit faster.\n* Free add-on - it won't be extra charged \nOf course we are preparing more cool stuff, but we will publish it after reaching first stretch goal :)\nBoard&Dice Publishing, or as we like to call ourselves the BaD Team, is mostly just three geeks fully dedicated to games, we publish only what we love.\nBoard games are not only an idea for business to us, they are mainly a passion, that enables us to develop personally and explore our limitations in several areas at the same time. Since we are a small publishing venture we have the privilege to publish only the games that we find interesting and that drive our inner geeks.\nTo put it short\u2014we can publish games that fascinate us. Just like it was with the Beer Empire first edition or Dice Brewing which reflected our love for brewing, it\u2019s also the case with Exoplanets which reflected our huge interest in the cosmos, the typical area of \u201cscience\u201d or mechanisms governing the universe. And of course Multiuniversum was just as cool and we loved the mechanics and had crazy idea for a theme.\nYou should also know that it isn\u2019t our first Crowdfunding campaign. We have carried out a successful campaign for Exoplanets and Multiuniversum Project: Cthulhu on Kickstarter, but also an international campaign for The Curse of The Black Dice game held on a Polish crowdfunding portal. We\u2019ve got experience in carrying out international projects, so we can assure you, that the games will reach your hands without delays.\nWe are fully invested in every title we publish, not only in terms of promotion or production, but we also support authors in the optimization and perfection of their ideas.\nThe staff Board&Dice consists of three positively crazed individuals. BaD Squad core is:\nWe\u2019re three geeks from Poland with heads full of ideas for compelling and out of the ordinary games.\nJoins us in this project! In our team you can also find great guy, who are doing for us all those beautiful arts and layouts - Pawe\u0142 Nizio\u0142ek.\n           ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs Board&Dice we have experience in international sales and delivery of games to Europe, North America and Asian countries (distribution of the Dice Brewing, Exoplanets, Multiuniversum \u2013 and many other games, we are selling in our web store). So we can assure you that after the period indicated in the campaign your backed games will be delivered into your hands.\n\nMultiuniversum Project Cthulhu is almost finished in gameplay and graphical design. It is also in testing process here in Poland and with the authors test groups in Germany.\n\nWe were working hard on this game and that\u02bcs why we believe that Beer Empire is well designed in every tiny detail and the only thing left is the production and delivery of purchased items.\n\nIn order to guarantee the highest quality, we decided that the game will be printed by one of our most important partners which has been operating on the international market for a long time and guarantees the proper engagement and support for us. \n\nAdditionally, we\u02bcve already executed a plan of logistics for deliveries and have acquired a International Partner, who allows us to deliver packages worldwide. On the other hand, Europe and North America is the area in which we\u02bcre successfully executing deliveries of games to our partners, shops or directly to players buying items from our online shop on a daily basis.\n\nThis long description is our way to tell you that the campaign and game itself is well prepared and we\u02bcve already spent several long months working on it. \u201eNew\u201d Beer Empire was on our agenda for the last 2 years...\n\nIf you have any questions for us or have any doubts then don\u02bct hesitate to contact us.

The first player to complete the puzzle by positioning their heroes accordingly collect the quest card and its benefits. \n  Each round is broken down into two phases, the day phase and the night phase.\n  In the night phase, players will roll adventure dice in a communal press-your-luck fashion to try to accomplish the tasks at the locations they ended at during the day phase. This could be fighting a goblin, learning a spell, or delving into a temple. But be careful, if you take too much damage you may exhaust and lose all that round's progress and more! \nPlayers keep track of their heroes' collective health, power and progress on personal adventure logs.\nAnd when you acquire powerful items, you equip them right to your ITEMeeples\u2122! \nPlayers keep track of their spell progress, and the rounds magic level on a community magic mat. As the round's magic increases, goblins become more threatening and even your own power turns from good to bad!\nAfter five rounds, the game is over. While you may not have single handedly saved the world, did you accomplish more than the other players? Whoever has the most points in the end from goblins killed, spells learned, quests accomplished, and legendary items acquired, wins the game!\n    Help us stretch on Social Media: \nClick to visit us on Facebook!\n    Click to find us on Twitter!\n  More stretch goals:\n                          Community Suggested Stretch Goal!\n  This is a DELUXE ONLY Stretch Goal.\n      Glorious Victories are digital content for the Premium Print 'N Play.

What you see here is everything you need to play!\nEach turn presents a new puzzle as you navigate the varying cards in your hand and the ever changing cards secreted away in the dungeon!\nThere are two decks and the Multi-User Dungeon expansion pack available through this Kickstarter. Each dungeon deck offers a unique set of cards to adventure in. Both dungeons are also compatible with the Season 1 Dungeon Builder Sets! More on the multiplayer expansion pack below!\nAdditionally, everyone who backs for a dungeon or more receives the Season 2 Promo Cards! \n  At 600 backers we added new tiers that will allow you to get the first two all-new Dungeon Builder Sets. And at 700 we unlocked the last two!\nThe 100 Swords Dungeon Builder Sets are 15 cards each (items, monsters, an obstacle, and a boss) that you can use to get the most out of 100 Swords. They're only $7 each, $1 off for this campaign, and we designed our Dungeon Builder Sets to be used in two ways:\nThe first is easy: choose your favorite dungeon, slap on the Dungeon Builder Set's cards, choose which boss you want to play with, and get to it! Now your dungeon is longer, and has new cards that change up gameplay. Adding a Dungeon Builder Set to a dungeon will lengthen playtime up to 10 minutes. If you have both decks and both sets, you'll have a lot of variants to play with!\nThe second way you can use a Dungeon Builder Set is to make your own dungeon from scratch! Take cards from the two dungeons and the two sets, construct your own dungeon dive, and compete with friends!\nEach week during the campaign we'll run polls for nouns and adjectives. Backers will be able to suggest and vote for them. At the end, you'll vote for the favorites to determine what the new promo cards will be! Last season they inspired Awkward Narwhalman and Behemoth Atom which were pretty rad cards. We're excited to see what happens this time!\nWhile working on Season 1, we designed a lot of cards and learned a lot about what makes swords and monsters and fun dungeons tick. We've put that experience to work:\n2 New Dungeons - If you've played 100 Swords, you know you can't have too many dungeons. We've designed two all new standalone dungeons with awesome new cards!\nSupport for 3-4 Players - We have official support for more players with the all-new Multi-User-Dungeon Expansion Pack for 3-4 player games! All you need are two decks and the expansion to get delving!\n2 New Backer-Selected Promo Cards - Voted on by you, the backers!\n4 New Dungeon Builder Sets - We've unlocked all four awesome new dungeon builder set expansions!\nNew Solo Rules - A challenging new solo game mode with a special card included in the promo pack!\nNew Multiplayer Castle Playmat - This new playmat is ideal for 3-4 player games!\nBack this campaign and receive an all-new unique Kickstarter promo card per deck and save $1 off the retail price on everything!\nDid you miss the original campaign? We have added tiers with limited quantities that include Season 1 cards for those that are looking for them later in the campaign. We have limited supply of cards from Season 1! We will do our best to make sure cards are available. \nThe current plan is to allow people who want all of the cards to acquire them via Season 1 and Season 2 combination tiers. Because Kickstarter doesn't officially support add-ons, we may have to resort to a post-campaign manager for piecemeal requests for Decks and Dungeon Builder Sets from Season 1.\nLet us know what you'd be interested in getting in the comments!\nSmall Footprint - Ever want to play a deck-builder but not have to lug around a giant box? 100 Swords is the same size as a traditional poker deck, both in terms of card count and box size. Those 54 cards include everything you need to play - 18 starter cards, 3 rentals, and 33 cards in the dungeon (including items, monsters, and its infamous boss).\nEasy to Learn - There are only 3 types of cards in 100 Swords; items, monsters, and obstacles. Learning the game only takes minutes, and once you know it, teaching it takes half as long. The rules of the game are a straightforward take on classic deck-builders with some interesting quirks thrown in that mix the genre up in new and interesting ways.\nTactical Gameplay - Each turn in 100 Swords is a puzzle where you do your best to use every card as optimally as possible. You'll have to use every bit of info you have to not waste any resources and play the best possible turn, every turn.\nHidden Information - When you first step into the dungeon, every card you'll be interacting with will be face-down. As the game progresses, cards will change from hidden to revealed and back again. As the dungeon shifts from players defeating monsters and acquiring items, you'll be wracking your brain to remember if that card you're moving to is that awesome sword, or a powerful monster. \n  \"Having to literally explore the marketplace of cards....gives you a surprising amount to think about!.... Incredibly thematic.\" \nRichard Ham - Rhado Runs Through\n\"The art, humor, and gameplay in 100 Swords comes together to form a delightful dungeon delve. Elements like item rental and using your equipment as energy are clever, and the deck building makes me feel like I'm improving my bag of tricks to tackle the dungeon. I recommend this for anyone looking for a light hearted deck builder that plays quickly.\"\nSuzanne - Dice Tower Contributor\n\"I think this would be an excellent game to teach somebody the ropes of how to play a deck building game.... A whole lot of puzzle solving greatness in one tiny box!.... The possibilities of expansions are literally limitless.\" \nUndead Viking\n\"100 Swords is a great balance between luck and light strategy. I love when a turn comes together and you get more equipment room after room. Of course, finding a big baddie and taking him down or sneaking by him and getting more stuff is fun too, as long as my opponent isn't able to get by the monster!\" \nKen - Geek-craft.com\n\"100 Swords is a satisfying and fun romp through a dungeon without the tediousness of a classic dungeon crawl.\"\nAcross the Board Games \nCurious about the specifics? Check out our video below! You can view the online rules here (1.2 - just updated at launch!), and you can download the rules here (1.0 - release).\nEach turn, you'll be playing cards to move into, and interact with the dungeon. A lot can happen on a given turn, maybe you'll find some cool items? Or maybe you'll run into some tough monsters?\nYou'll also be using the cards in your hand to defeat those monsters, acquire items, and clear obstacles. Acquired items will end up in your deck, which in turn will make you more powerful and more able to defeat stronger monsters! Many items also have effects that are important to consider.\nDeciding when and how to use the cards in your hand and which cards in the dungeon to acquire or defeat is the key to winning 100 Swords!\nWhen the dungeon deck has too few cards to refresh the dungeon, or when you defeat the boss, the game is over! And remember, it's all about the gold! At the end of the game, the player whose cards are worth the most gold wins!\nCheck out this official walkthrough to see the game in action:\nHere's a quick video rundown with BoardGameGeek from Gen Con 2016: \nCheck out the official online rulebook:\n  We learned a lot from our previous 100 Swords campaign. We have streamlined our process to make this project turn around super-fast:\nWe've designed our stretch goal content in advance.\nWe've got a simplified reward tier system.\nOur shipping partner now has better support for post-campaign managers for those who need to make changes once the campaign is over.\nArt work for any stretch goals will begin immediately when and if they are funded.\nYou've asked, and we're delivering: In addition to the two new dungeons, we're also offering the all-new Multi-User Dungeon Expansion Pack which adds support for one or two more players! The expansion features all new items, monsters, and obstacles and a new Mini-Boss. All you need are two dungeons and the the expansion, and you're ready to crawl the dungeons with 3 and 4 players! It's also $1 off during this campaign!\nMore info on Multiplayer in Update #10! \n NEW! At 750 backers, we\u2019ll add a new multiplayer Castle Playmat! This new mat will be designed for multiplayer and will be bigger than the season 1 Dungeon Playmat. We\u2019ll also add a new tiers that include EVERYTHING for Season 2 and Season 1. If we reach this goal, we will also unlock a new promo card for EVERYONE!\nAt 800 backers, we unlocked a whole new set of solo rules. For Season 1, we released \"Gold Greed\" which is a simple way to have a have a way to compete with the dungeon. It's a great clean way to do it! I've been excited about this goal for a while now. These new rules are pretty great! With this version, the opponent is the Weary Warrior, and she actually has her own of cards which you use on her turn. Really happy with how this work, so we're super excited to share these with you! In addition, we're providing a new promo card to support this new solo mode which will be added to the promo pack!\nWe're estimating a April delivery. \nWhy so quick? We've chosen to do our manufacturing in the US for Shift, Province, Shadow of the Elder Gods, and the last season of 100 Swords. We've been very happy with the communication, quick manufacturing timelines, and production quality, and so we're continuing in that tradition. While it can be slightly more expensive, at the end of the day you're getting high-quality, ethically produced games with crazy-fast turnaround times! No waiting on slow trans-pacific cargo ships.\nAll rewards will ship from the US. Other solutions would make our game cost prohibitive. You want 100 Swords, and we're committed to getting you the game! Thanks for your understanding. It's also worth noting that shipping costs are even lower than our previous campaign!\n  Shipping is expensive, but it's a cost we can all share. To respectfully account for this cost, everyone receives a small discount on shipping without offering free shipping.\nCustoms Notice: Because this is very small and inexpensive game with a low declaration value, most international backers looking to get in on this Kickstarter will not have any customs expenses with any of the launch rewards.\n  Laboratory is a game publisher based in Seattle, WA, USA. We made everything you see here!\nIn 2013 we designed, developed, and published our very first microgame with the help of backers like you! Shift is a dueling card game that boils down Japanese-style CCG's into a single card. All you need is a friend, two cards, and some coins to throw-down in an epic anime inspired battle! It was even published in Brazil by our friends at Funbox Jogos!\nIn Spring 2014, we Kickstarted the original Province, which has over 10,000 copies to date. It was also our first game to reach stores. Province tackled the challenge of making a competitive two-player micro eurogame. We think it's pretty swell. Other people seem to agree!\nIn Fall 2015, we brought our micro ameritrash game, Shadow of the Elder Gods, to Kickstarter. In it, 1-4 players work together to stop a deck of eldritch threats from bringing about the end of all things. Shadow of the Elder Gods is a big game in a small box, and it's now in stores thanks to backers like you!\nWe also successfully delivered the first season of 100 Swords! ;)\nWith your help 100 Swords: Season 2 will bring bring a bunch of awesome new cards out into the world!\n  Project Video Music Credit:\nAdventure Meme Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be our fifth time working with our manufacturing partners at Delano Service. If there are drastic manufacturing issues, there will be problems delivering the rewards. However, by choosing a printer in the US, we have the additional benefit of easier accountability if the product fails to meet our expectations. We've handled the manufacturing of over 16,000 games with our previous projects, and we've learned from that experience.\n\nIn addition, we will also continue to partner with Ship Naked for our fulfilment needs. They've handled four of our previous campaigns as well as our direct fulfilment needs, and they've always excelled in pricing, reliability, and respectful customer service.\n\nEvery project introduces new challenges. If you look at our updates for 100 Swords, Shadows of the Elder Gods, Province, and Shift, you will see that we try to balance update spam with important news. We make great efforts to keep you informed of exactly where the project is in the production pipeline, and we're always happy to answer questions here on Kickstarter or via email.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "DUNGEON LURKER", "descp": "Receive updates on the project!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}], "stat": ["47 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 9 or more", "title": "I CAME FOR THE M.U.D.", "descp": "Receive a copy of the multiplayer expansion pack.

Pilots (Variable Powers)! Now players compete to hire the best pilots, with powerful abilities, in addition to competing over the best planets.\nPilots are hired by activating 2, or 3, like dice. You activate 2 like dice if the pilot you're hiring is trained to fly the ship you're assigning them to, or you activate 3 like dice if you need to assign the pilot to a ship they are not trained to fly.\n2. Exploration (Press-Your-Luck)! Now you can send your ships into unexplored space on a hunt for resources or exploration badges! But beware, you may end up in the orbit of a black hole or being forced to lose resources of your own. To explore, you simply move a ship onto the exploration card. Then, if there are any exploration cards face up, you may take one. OR, you can flip over the top card of the deck, if it's red, you must take it and stop exploring. If it's green, you can take it, or go again until 3 exploration cards are face up, at which point you would have to take the next card you flip.\n3. Badges (Set-Collection)! Thought you had a handle on everyone's scores in Tiny Epic Galaxies?? Now you'll have to think again. Players will be collecting exploration badges from pilots they hire and exploration cards they acquire. After the game is over, players are rewarded bonus victory points for each badge type they have the most of. These points can stack up fast and provide opportunities for come-from-behind victories! \n  Since Tiny Epic Galaxies Beyond the Black is an expansion to Tiny Epic Galaxies, we will grandfather the component qualities from TEG into TEGBTB.\nFREE COMPONENT UPGRADES\n2mm Box Thickness\nSpot UV Box Logos\nBox Interior Printing (using the hangar image at the top of the page)\n310 gsm Ivory Core Linen Cardstock\nCards with Rounded Corners\nBelow are additional upgrades the game will come with if we are able to reach the listed goals.

To offset this, while remaining fiscally responsible, we have included a small discount for ALL shipping, but no shipping is free.\nRegarding customs: because this game comes in a tiny box with a low declaration, most international backers, of 1 and 2 copies, will not get hit with customs or import fees. The games will be delivered right to your door. We have shipped thousands and thousands of copies of Tiny Epic games to international backers without any occurrences.\n  Add-ons, such as base and deluxe copies of TEGBTB, Premium Print & Plays (including the TEGBTB premium PnP), previous Tiny Epic games, play mats, and more, will be offered in PledgeManager. Though the full menu won't be offered until the PledgeManager is open.\nAll reward tiers offer access to PledgeManager. \nYou MAY add to your pledge for add-ons shown on the above PledgeManager menu and your additional funds will be available for you in PledgeManager. \nPlease do not add to your pledge for items not shown on the above PledgeManager menu. \n      The 6 design goals of a Tiny Epic game!\n\"Tiny Epic\" is an exclusive series of small box games produced by Gamelyn Games and designed by Scott Almes.  \nEach game in the series is entirely unique but strictly adheres to TWO core values: TINY and EPIC!  \n\u2022 TINY referring to the small box used for each game AND the simple, easy to understand, set of rules each possess.  \n\u2022 EPIC referring to their surprisingly gratifying gameplay.

We will provide tracking information for the boat when the games leave China. \n\n3. We are working with Ship Naked again for project fulfillment. Having worked with them for over 4 years, we are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way.

Tribes from both games can be combined for new challenges and even greater replayability. Each tribe consists of 6 different creatures with unique abilities and distinct power levels. Tribes from both editions can easily be distinguished by the color of their representative dice. \nRoots of Mali vs Light of Dragons (prototype)\nIf you are retailer and want to order larger quantities please get in touch for an individual offer. Group pledges welcome.\nIn addition to these stretch goals we have a community stretch goal that will be unlocked as soon as a certain number of Victory Points is reached.\nEach player takes on the role of the forest tribe in the fight for the sole domination of the Warlands. Through tactical use and clever movement of your own army you can outwit and defeat opposing creatures. In this confrontional game the players have several standard actions. A tribe contains six creatures of various power levels and individual skills. By vanquishing an opposing creature you gain victory points equal to the creature\u2018s power level. The first player to collect 10 victory points wins. This is achieved by tactically moving creatures and exercising their special powers to outwit your opponent, eliminating his character dice from the board, the Warring Lands.\nThis is the first video of a series of quick introductory videos for Roots of Mali. Audio language is German but we have added English subtitles. You can open up a YouTube playlist for all videos.\nRoots of Mali (digital online game)\nLight of Dragons (digital online game)\nLow-Ink Print`n`Play (free download)\nShipping is EU-, US, AUS- and Canada-friendly. Rewards for these regions will be shipped from within the country.\nKickstarter will automatically add the correct amount of shipping costs when you choose a reward level and pledge for it. This table is meant to display your shipping costs before you checkout.\n1. Bringing Roots of Mali to Life.\nSuncoregames is a small publisher, founded by us, Adrian and Bujar, designers of the games Light of Dragons and Roots of Mali. When we released Light of Dragons we used our own private money to produce the first batch of games and sold these during SPIEL in Essen. This was great to build up a solid fan base for the line in Central Europe. With Roots of Mali we want to scale things, reach a larger audience and reach out to people all over the world, not just in Europe. Since we don't have a distributor, Kickstarter is the perfect platform to do do that. With the help of Kickstarter we can bring Roots of Mali to you, from gamers to gamers. We need the power of Kickstarter to produce the game. No Kickstarter no Roots of Mali, it is as simple as that. \n2. Discount\nWe are offering Roots of Mali and Light of Dragons for a discounted price on Kickstarter to get all early adopters started with a benefit. If we reach out funding goal and thus make the games, they will be sold at a higher price during conventions and on our website. Furthermore shipping is also reduced during the campaign and customs-friendly. Rewards of the campaign will be shipped by a fulfilment company from within several areas such as the EU, USA, Canada. We are not able to provide this service outside of Kickstarter because we are living in Switzerland from where we usually ship.\n3. Strech Goals\nThe game as such is complete and a full product from the very moment we reach our funding goal. But we have had fun ideas how to bring in some game changers, additional challenges and variants. These will be added as Stretch Goals that add even more variety and replayability. With your contribution you will alter the outcome of the final product.\n4. Exclusive Content\nAt least one of the stretch goals will be exclusive to Kickstarter backers. What exactly does that mean? We are not offering these exclusives at a later date. We won't sell them separately. Their production will be limited to the number of backers. However, any remainders due to set production numbers might be used as promo during conventions. On a side note: We are not making game relevant content exclusive, because we think that this is not fair to the gaming community.\n5. The Community\nThe main reason why Kickstarter is great is the awesome community. We are avid backers ourselves and have joined many campaign. Check our bio for more information on that. We want a fun campaign with nice people to meet and chat with. This is almost as good as meeting people at a convention or sitting at a table for a game with friends. So last but not least we have chosen Kickstarter because we are part of the community ever since and because of you.\nWe are Bujar and Adrian and together we are Suncoregames \u2013 a young and innovative team from Switzerland that creates board games. We have started with our first board game design, Light of Dragons, in 2015. Our intention is to create more games with new ideas, and new mechanisms that feature a lot of strategy while still being easy to access and play.   \nFor the campaign we have teamed up with Daniel from Board Game Circus who is leading the marketing department and backer communication.\n\nThe beautiful thematic illustrations and graphic work on the dice and game board were done by Malte J. Zirbel. He is a very talented artists and we are grateful to have him with us. You can see some of his work in the following portfolio: www.artstation.com/artist/maltezirbel\nBujar Haskaj (26) / Adrian Bolla (27)\n                      Kicktraq Day-1 Project\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPublishing a board game is a complicated process which is prone to many mistakes. During the past month we have worked hard to prepare this campaign and manufacturing of the product. The rules are final and translated, the illustrations for the game as you see it are all done, the print-layout for the board is done and the production quote from our manufacturer is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\nRoots of Mali is our second game. It will be produced by the same manufacturer and in the same quality as Light of Dragons, thus we are pretty confident that everything will run smoothly. Light of Dragons is of stunning quality. For this campaign we have made a proper calculation, partnered with experienced shipping companies and teamed up with Daniel from Board Game Circus who is supporting us in marketing and promotion.\n\nIf we reach stretch goals, our illustrator will need some extra time to work on these. Finally the rule books are undergoing professional layout and editing after the campaign. More stretch goals will eventually delay production.\n\nPre-production and production usually takes a while and unforeseen events may occur. Such as color corrections that have to be done or sending print-proofs and material samples back and forth until everything is exactly the way we want it. We want everything to be perfect before we start production. If anything of this happens it might delay production.\n\nDelivering goods around the globe is no easy task but we have teamed up with fulfillment companies with an expertise in board game deliveries. Once these companies have the manufactured products in their warehouse they will start shipping these rewards to you. In the past we have seen deliveries being delayed due to harbor strikes, plane strikes, warehouse strikes or troubles with customs at the border. Several holidays might as well delay delivery. If anything of this happens the project might run late.\n\nWhatever happens, positive or negative, we will share it with you. As avid backers and lovers of the Kickstarter community we are 100% dedicated to open backer communication. We will involve you as much as possible and be transparent with our process. During the project we will be present answering questions and reading all comments. During the campaign and production process we will update you regularly to make sure you always know where we are at.\n\nP.

Players take the roles of Dwarf Treasure Seekers who are trying to survive an encounter with a furious dragon. The company is running away and in the same time is trying to get rid of the looted treasure. In a dwarves\u2019 world it would be surely considered a dishonour to simply throw the precious stuff away.\nThus, the aim of the game is to dispose of your gold in a clever way. You may keep SOME of the coins but you need to be the one with the least of them. Otherwise, the dragon burns you to ashes.\nThe game is intuitive and easy to play. In your turn you play your cards to get rid of gold and you use them to protect yourself during other players\u2019 turns. React to what is happening on the table, be clever, be fast, be sly. Don\u2019t worry if you fail. The game is quick so there are many occasions to take revenge.\n    Why Back This Project?\nWe can't produce this game without Kickstarter and without the support of generous backers like you. We believe we have a great game here and want to bring it to tables all over the world. Every dollar we make will go directly back in to making Dwarves in Trouble a better game.

Its illustrations are designed to be pleasant to an eye as well as to entertain the players. For thi reason we focused on high quality graphics. We made sure that the pictures are large and that there is a reasonable number of clear icons. All the game illustrations were made by Rafa\u0142 Sza\u0142apa. He is a recognised cartoonist (Bler) and a computer games graphics designer (e.g. for Artifex Mundi). You may appreciate his skills in the films we share on our project\u2019s site.\nHere you can check his Artstation profile: rafalszlapa.artstation.com\n            We are running two board games cafes. Due to this fact, we were able to test Dwarves with our customers: both the experienced ones and those who are only starting their gaming adventure.\nWe have been \u201ctorturing\u201d them for months playing the game in order to gain precious feedback and to develop our game. Over 1200 people played the game. All the positive reactions, comments, good fun and laughter we had seen confirmed our opinion that Dwarves in Trouble is a good, fast and interesting game.\nWe had even better feedback at the 2015 Essen Fairs. During the fairs over 30 publishers from all over the world proposed publishing it in their own language.\n      We ship games in bulk to fulfillment centers around the world to reduce customs fees & VAT and to keep shipping prices low.Game weight will be about 0,5 kg (basic version) and 2 kg ( with Metal coins)\nPlease note, that shipping will be paid after the Kickstarter campaign ends, from the Pledge Manager level. Prices are not final and might slightly change in the Pledge Manager, depending on how many stretch goals we will unlock  (especially if we unlock Metal Coins set).\nESTIMATED SHIPPING RATES AT THIS POINT ARE:\nEurope - $5-$9  (Poland $4-$5)\nUS & Canada - $6-$10\nAsia - $10-$20\nRest of the world - $20+\nFree pickup from our cafes in Krak\u00f3w and Wroc\u0142aw.\n  We are a team of board games maniacs who decided to devote all their energy to creating something unique in the board games world.\nWe are running two cafes designed for players, we run our own TV channel, we unite and integrate the biggest players community in Poland. \nHow had this all begun? We had always needed a convenient place to play board games. We decided to meet this demand and create a place that would be suitable for both ourselves and for other games passionates. We knew exactly what the players need and we wanted to put it into practice. Our first step was finding a good place. A hidden backstreet building seemed to be perfect. We knew that only players would be able to find it. After 8 months of a thorough redecoration there was a moment to verify our expectations. There were over 400 people at the opening day and it proved the place is special. With time, Hex became something more than a caf\u00e9 with board games. It has turned into a meeting place for the gamers society.\nOur ambition was to create a place where you can just drop in with your friends, pick a game, sit comfortably with a drink or a snack and simply enjoy the game. We are trying to encourage as many people as possible to playing games: we are focusing on both experienced players and on beginners. We are trying to show them that board games are not only a great way to pass the time but also a method to develop your skills. As you can see, our passion for board games is expressed in many ways, like running the caf\u00e9, the publishing, reviewing games. All of the above allow us to make our board games dreams come true and also to run projects appreciated by others.\nIf you want to learn more about us, please, visit our Facebook profile or check our Brochure\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDwarfs in Trouble is our first game and our first Kickstarter campaign. We have spent a lot of time and put lots of effort before its launch. We have been testing the game on hundreds of our caf\u00e9\u2019s guests and on Essen Fair\u2019s participants. We have been working on the graphics details, we have been searching for cards and coins manufactures. We are lucky to be supported by our friends from well-established and experienced publishers who have already published their games either with Kickstater or by publishing hundreds of titles a year themselves. \n\nOn the day when our campaign launches, the complete basic version of the game is ready to be produced. We have already decided on the producer. However, after reaching specific stretch goals our designer is going to draw additional cards, which have already been pre-designed. \nThe only risk we might be afraid of is the time we need to produce the cards and coins and delivering all the stuff on time. Both aspects do not depend on us personally. We tried to set reasonable time frames. We would rather surprise you with an earlier delivery. \u263a\n\nWe want to keep you informed about the production process stages and the delivery of your copy of the game during the campaign. As we are passionate perfectionists we are open to your feedback. We work on our projects with our hearts so we want them to be possibly best quality.

I love surprises :)\n Social Stretch Goals\n https://twitter.com/ @insideupgames\nwww.facebook.com/insideupgames/\nwww.instagram.com @insideupgames\nhttps://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/201186/summit-board-game \n  Summit is a mountain-climbing game for 2 to 6 players, ages 14 and up, and takes roughly 20\u201330 minutes per player. \nA triangular tile placing, tile manipulation, point to point movement, route building, dice rolling, competitive, \"take that!\" game, with a little area control, and press your luck along with variable player powers and variable phase order, will guarantee you'll never play the same game twice.\nPlayers will create trails up the mountain as they race for pole position. But this isn\u2019t a straightforward race - it's unique for two reasons.\nFirst, the race takes place on a dangerous mountain so players will see each other both ascending and descending the tiles. Having players in each other's way and in each other's faces leads to another of Summit's unique mechanics.\nThe second reason is the Karma Track, another unique mechanic that allows players to use Karma cards to actively help or hinder their opponents.\nAs players compete for better positioning, they are able to use these cards to share food, sabotage oxygen, slow players down, or protect someone from a fall. Either way, players must balance their Karma points with their race strategy if they want to come out on top.\nThe up and down of the mountain coupled with the good and evil of the Karma cards works on many levels. It keeps the players packed together as leaders will try to slow players on their heels, but speed up the players who are farther behind. And the players who are behind will attempt to slow the leaders and help each other.\nThis can create temporary alliances and truces, but they never last as there can only be one winner.\nSummit is an exciting adventure game in which players are as worried about surviving the mountain as they are about their opponents.\n(See co-op/solo expansion below.)\n    Who will you choose; the American ex-military with his survival training, the British doctor with her medical skills, the Canadian guide and his knowledge of the mountain, the French cook with his plentiful supplies, the Jamaican athlete with her raw speed, or the weather hardened Swedish naturopath.\nPlayers can decide if they are going to play nice or mean, work together or at odds, who they want to aid or thwart - and they can change their mind on a whim, for an alliance, or for revenge, as there can be only one real winner.\n       Each character has five stats to track on their player mat; Food, Oxygen, Weight, Health, and Speed, which are all in constant flux. \nPlayers have decision to make and resources to balance, because the more supplies they carry, the heavier they become and the slower they move. On the other hand, if they travel too light and fast, they risk serious injury and death, becoming a permanent fixture on the mountain.\nThis allows players to be the master of their race strategy - and of their ultimate survival.\n      The Event Deck lets the mountain come alive as an ever changing entity of its own, throwing weather and adventure at the mountaineers. But beware, this mountain would rather add you to its landscape then see you return home.\nThe Karma Deck and scoring system allow players to attack or protect each other as they race for position. Although the good deeds will raise your score, you might need to play dirty to secure the win!\nThe Item Deck will help to equip players with the tools and supplies they will need to survive the treacherous environment, and overcome their scheming competitors.\n        Summit uses unique triangular tiles which create some important limitations and force players in certain directions and possible confrontations.\nWith seven different route layouts on three different types of tiles (Regular, Ice, Thin Air), combined with earth-changing events and in-game tile manipulation, competitors will never face the same mountain twice. \n    Summit's large board is dominated by the playing area in the middle, and flanked with tracks on either side. Players will be placing the base and halfway camps depending on the difficulty setting and laying their tiles within the grid lines.\nOn the righthand side is the Karma Track, where players can easily see the standing of their opponents' Karma, and decided how kind or evil they can afford to be.\nOn the lefthand side there is the Position Score Track, for points throughout the race, The Blizzard Track to track the declining weather conditions, and the Numbered Item Slots, where players can drop and pick up items.\n    If backstabbing your friends isn't your thing, try the co-operative or solo expansion, where players must work together to survive the harrowing trek.\nThe Karma Track and Position Track are covered by the new Sherpa Track and Time of Day Track to change the goal and strategy of the game.\nPlayers have 24 game hours to try and make their ascent. At least one player must summit and survive the descent to base camp for their expedition to be considered a success.\nWithout a halfway camp to resupply, players must rely on their trusty Sherpas to carry the extra supplies and items they will need.  \nThe group will also decide on the ideal time to attempt their ascent, as their movement will be hampered during the nighttime hours.\nThis is a dangerous game, and it is not uncommon for players to sacrifice themselves for the good of the group.\nThe co-op/solo expansion comes with new components and cards as well as a unique scoring system so that you can always push your limits to reach your highest score! \n             During Summit\u2019s months of playtesting, players repeatedly mentioned how much they liked:\n\u2022 The Karma Cards which create direct interaction between players even off turn, keeping players interested throughout\n\u2022 The asymmetrical player mats, which track the interactive ebb and flow of food, oxygen, weight, health, and speed (resource management)\n\u2022 The distinctly different character stats and abilities\n\u2022 The thematic outcomes caused by the Event Cards\n\u2022 The variability created by game customization and the difficulty settings\n    \"I have never seen such a positive response for a product still in development... Excited to get my hands on the final version and get it on our cafe shelf.\"\n\u2013 Derek Fung of agamecafe.ca\n\"Summit is hugely replayable, because it's customizable for any circumstance. Need a short co-op? No problem. Long competition? Got you covered. And the individual player tracking boards are brilliant, letting you check the balance between resources at any time.\"\n\u2013 Jackie Laderoute of GameShelf\n\"I've gotten to play Summit in both competitive and cooperative modes, and it was fun\u2026my favorite part of the game is the balance between speed and safety. It's a game that allows for some really great moments (both good and bad), and I like that there are different approaches to victory\u2026you do get to make a lot of decisions on which things you want to risk, and that's one of the things I love about it.\"\n\u2013 Jonathan H. Liu of geekdad.com\n\u201cFirst off, I love the theme of Summit. It feels adventurous and the decisions you make, while not really life and death, certainly can feel that way\u2026the system to track your resources, weight, and speed really brings the theme to life\u2026the karma cards really shine\u201d \n-Andrew Smith of boardgamequest.com\n Media Coverage\nA huge thank you to Bryce Brown for letting us use some of his amazing photography in the video.

Where did it come from? When did it become popular? How are the games created? Who are the people behind the miniatures? How does it impact people's lives?\nWe have been working alongside some of the leading companies in the wargaming industry. Our documentary goes behind the scenes, providing exclusive interviews, following personal stories and documenting the creative processes involved. Our film will give viewers a rare and previously unseen insight into the world of wargaming from concept to table top.\nMany more individuals and companies involved.\nWhat else? The film will be rich in content covering all perspectives, eras and genres. We will also include interviews with many other companies and individuals who support the hobby, such as Youtubers, commission painters, and independent retailers.\nFour Personal Stories\nAs well as covering the general history and business aspects of the industry, we follow into how miniature wargaming has impacted the lives of four individuals. \nAndy Bryant - Andy is a war veteran suffering from PTSD. We explore how miniatures have impacted his life and helped him through difficult times. \nAndy hard at work, preparing for Salute.\nFollow Andy's journey as he tries to take his small business \"Small Terrain\" to the world's largest one-day wargaming event, Salute.\nChris Nicholls - Chris spent years in the wargaming industry before founding \"Macrocosm Miniatures\", a sci-fi miniature wargaming company in 2015.\nThe build up to UK Games Expo is upon him.\nFollow Chris' inspirational and creative journey as he struggles with establishing a new gateway game into his own miniature wargaming universe.\nMatt and Adam - Two life long friends from the South West of England with a passion for miniature wargaming.\nLet the games begin.\nSee what it really means to be a modern Wargamer;  how they prepare together, train together and then put their friendship aside to see who comes out on top.\nThe funds that we are seeking via Kickstarter will be used as followed.\nLicences: Licences for archive footage of the historical aspects of the miniature wargaming industry. We hope to obtain the licences for:\nNews footage such as the war in Kosovo. \nDND archive footage. \nPeter Jackson learning to sculpt from the Perry twins.\nEarly interviews and footage of historical figures and events.\nThe licences for a 30 second clip can cost upwards of \u00a31000 and we want our documentary to be rich with information as possible.\nPost-production editing: We have managed to complete nearly 90% of the filming for the movie and have been given some great and unexpected opportunities to obtain detailed insights into the industry. Our entire project has been led by the director Joseph Piddington with help from some excellent volunteers who are also passionate about the project. However, to achieve the same high quality in post-production we need to pay professional production artists to aid us. Colour-grading, graphic design, special effects artists, and voice over professionals are just some of the services we need to invest in.\nWages: Up to this point all of our team have been unpaid volunteers whose expenses have been paid. However the workload has now become too much and we have had to hire employees.\nTravel Expenses: Our documentary has taken us all across the world, from Canada and America, to Norway and all across the UK. We have seen and documented so much great footage and are grateful for everyone that has been involved. As you know, flights, trains, buses and fuel isn\u2019t cheap! There is still a lot more travelling on the horizon in order to complete the film, and take it to events and film festivals across the globe.\nFilm Festivals: We want to take this film to as many film festivals across the world as we can, and of course this costs money. Our opportunities for film festivals depends on the encouragement and support of our followers and backers. This includes travel, accommodation and submission fees, which can range from $20 - $200 for just one film festival, and we have high hopes to attend around 30 film festivals next year.\nFilm Premiere Costs: One of the things we would love to do is show our appreciation to everyone involved in the film. We would love to launch a premiere for all of the people involved and this will include location rental and expenses.\nPackaging: We want our film packaging to look as good as the content. Packaging includes paying an artist for commissioned work for the box art for the final DVD and Blu-Ray, high quality cases and tins as well as foam inserts for the miniatures. We also want to provide discs printed with high quality images.\nWe have managed to secure the support of an extremely experienced team to help make \"Miniature Wargaming The Movie\" a reality. They are drawn from across the United Kingdom and share our passion for this documentary.\nEquipment: The core equipment is already available and includes state of the art 4K video recording and ultra high definition film and video.\nHelp spread the word\nYou can also help by sharing details of this Kickstarter with as many people as possible using your preferred media.\nClick Here To Visit The Website.\n  Click Here To Like Us On Facebook.\n  Click Here To Follow Us On Twitter.\n  Click Here To See What Where Doing.\n     A Massive Thank You!!\nThank you for taking the time to read this Kickstarter.

Then wipe the dust from your goggles wastelander and come witness Wasteland Justice!\nWasteland Justice Game Box\nWasteland Justice is the d\u00e9but board game from Madbeard Games. Madbeard Games are a fledgling board game design and publishing company.\nIn Wasteland Justice you take on the role of a post apocalypse clan leader organising and racing a team of drivers and vehicles on a hi-octane wasteland track.  \nIn the Box\nWasteland Justice game Components\nThe game includes the following components:\n1 game track, made up of 2 straight and 4 corner pieces\n4 player boards, each made up of a clan header piece, and 3 vehicle board pieces (1 light, 1 Medium, and 1 Heavy).\n62 mini cards, comprised of 16 driver cards, 26 vehicle mod cards and 20 weapon cards.\n4 custom hot transfer dice, 3 movement dice (one for each vehicle size) and 1 weapon die.\n12 team vehicle models, 3 different sculpts in 4 colours.\n12 vehicle wreck models (used to add some random race obstacles and represent eliminated vehicles, when they occur).\n100 game tokens; 40 Ammo, 40 Damage and 20 Crowd Intervention tokens.\n1 standard 6 sided die and 1 standard 8 sided die used in game set-up.\nEnough zip locked bags to help organise storage.\n1 full colour rulebook.\nAll contained in a large 2 piece cardboard box.\nThese items and quantities may change based upon reaching any stretch goals.\nWasteland Justice - Card backs\nRulebook\nWe have a draft rulebook available here.\nWasteland Justice - Assembled Player Board\n Previews\nUndeadViking Video Review (note components shown in the video are prototype versions)\n\u201cIt is a lighter tactical strategy game but it is phenomenally fun and never did I feel my turn was wasted... \u201d\nGamefest Review\n4/5 Dragons - \"Bearing in mind this was a preview copy the components were of good quality and showed excellent production values. The artwork is excellent and very evocative.\"\nFull review can be found here: http://www.gamesfest.co.uk/news/2016/5/16/wasteland-justice-review\nRewards\nHelp us fund by pledging or if you cannot pledge at the moment please like us on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/Madbeardgames/ to help us spread the word.\nThe reward for pledge levels \u00a338, \u00a342 and \u00a345 are all the same.  All these backers will receive a full version of the board game, Wasteland Justice.\nAt \u00a398 - Colourful Wastelander - Backers will receive the full version of the board game, Wasteland Justice. In addition we will hand paint an extra set of vehicle models for your own personal use. (Please note that the end result may vary but will be to the same level of quality).\nUnpainted models (These are 3D printed Nylon prototypes - Production models will be molded PVC)\n  Painted models\nAt \u00a3250 - King (or Queen)  of the Desert (example below) -  Our character artist (Andres) will create a unique Wasteland Justice driver based upon a supplied photo. These driver cards will either be added to the base game, if there is no impact on our production time scales, otherwise we will create a promotion pack for all backers to include these additional driver cards.  We will work with the backers to decide upon the drivers' unique ability, but Madbeard Games decision will be final to avoid any drastic game play changes.\nExample King of the Desert process (Thanks to Dustin for letting us share this)\nMerchants of the Wasteland - we will be contacting all backers at this level to provide evidence that they are a retailer.  This level this is for 5 full games. Once funded and before we confirm shipping, you may request additional copies of the game should you require.\nStretch Goals\n We would like to make Wasteland Justice the best game it can be, we have the following stretch goals lined up on the starting grid;\n\u00a335,000 - Don't get us wrong, we love the weight and feel of the cards currently, but that extra weight and linen feel will provide that tactile edge. (This will be in the box).\n\u00a350,000 - Ramming the same class vehicle and tired of waiting those few seconds to use the same die as your opponent?  Wait no longer!  We will add an extra set of the custom dice to the game. (This may be a KS exclusive and the dice may be a separate item to the core game in your delivery).\n\u00a375,000 - During standard game set-up, 1 wreck model is randomly placed per track piece. With more wrecks we will add into the rules alternative set-up of two wrecks per track piece for extra chaos mode. Surely no-one would try three wrecks pre track piece...that would just be bedlam! (This may be a KS exclusive and the extra wreck models may be a separate item to the core game in your delivery).\nDepending on interest, other stretch goals maybe added.\nShipping costs\nShipping is added on to each pledge (except for \u00a31 or more reward level), Wasteland Justice should weigh in at around 2.8kg.  These are the shipping costs for individual* game rewards that will be added to your pledge;\n If your location is not listed, please contact us and we will get a quote and try to add the shipping option in.\nWasteland Justice - Individual Game - Shipping rates\n  Wasteland Justice - Movement and Weapon Dice\n* Merchant shipping varies between 1.2x up to 2.5x the individual shipping cost.  Please check the reward level and shipping before you confirm your pledge.  Also note that Merchant shipping does not ship to all the above locations.\nIf you  have a query around our dice please check out our update #4\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBefore launching, we have got all core components to a fully ready state for our chosen manufacturer (Boda - http://www.bdboardgame.com/index.php) so they will be ready to start production as soon as our Kickstarter funds have cleared. The only caveat here is stretch goals, depending if we are successful to reach stretch goals they may extend our delivery estimate . \n\nAlthough great and fantastic bonuses in board games, stretch goals, can unbalance the core game and extend production times. We have therefore tried to view stretch goals/some bespoke rewards slightly differently from normal. These bespoke rewards or additional stretch goals if we unlock the initial 3, will either state \"in the box\" or \"in a separate packet.\"\n\nStretch goals \"in the box\" will not impact our production estimate. The stretch goals \"separate packet\" will be designed asap and produced in parallel (mainly due to additional art requirements) to the base game. The separate packet items will still be shipped with the core game but in a separate packet(s). \n\nMatthew and Joe are board gamers and have backed numerous games on Kickstarter, we have seen projects run well and projects run not so well. We would like to think we will be bringing the things we have seen done well and learning from those that have encountered some hiccups (in production, unforeseen costs, delays other timing oversights etc) and combining that into a well run project. \n\nDon't get this wrong, we will make mistakes, it would be foolish of us to believe we are perfect. However we will put our hands up when we go wrong and most importantly we will communicate every step of the way and provide regular updates. We strongly believe that our backers should know their upfront costs. Should anything unforeseen happen that requires additional expenditure we will meet this ourselves to ensure delivery of the game to our backers.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "madbeard games\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nmadbeard gaming is a start up board game designer and publisher, keep a crazy eye out for our first board game release Wasteland Justice on...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #12", "update_userinfo": "As the clock counts down", "update_content": "Hello Wastelanders\nThis Kickstarter has been an education for me that is for sure.

This game is easy to grasp for children as young as five years old. It's the game that the kids love and the adults always secretly want to play!  A fast paced game for everyone\nIf we get fully funded, this amazing game will be in your hands within three weeks.\nTreasure Hunt is the first-ever board game to offer both cooperative and competitive playing.    \nIn Cooperative Mode, players compete together against the pirate who often pops up to snatch away coins on the board. Cooperative Mode is an excellent way to build teamwork and problem-solving skills, all while having a blast playing a game together as a family. This mode is ideal for families with young kids.\nThe competitive mode is suitable for older kids and adults ( sometimes, younger ones might enjoy this mode as well once they master the game in cooperative mode). The object of the competitive game is to grab as many treasure coins as possible while using ruthless strategy to block your opponents from taking those coins away.\nIn both modes, every game played is unique; at the beginning of the game the coins are scattered randomly across the board. Lots of replay value!\nFrom CodingFarmers to Treasure Hunt\nWe are the creators of codingFarmers, the Java programming board game for kids. While codingFarmers was designed to teach programming concepts to kids, in this game, we focused on teaching strategy and critical thinking though a game that is fun to play for kids and adults and that takes less than a few minutes to learn and play.\nThis game focuses on simplicity over complex rules that take more time to understand. This game can be played with 2-6 players. Kids as young as five years can join the fun too with their older siblings and parents.\nLet the coin-grabbing frenzy commence!\nIn this game, you are an explorer searching through the Amazon jungle for buried treasure amid the ruins of lost cities. In order to find any treasure, you need to cut through the jungle and build roads. Along the way, you grab the gold coins you come across!  \nHow long you want to play is up to you. Use fewer treasure coins if you are pressed for time, You can also keep the coins closer to the center slot for a quick, fun game!\n   The Board\nOur board stands out right away for its simplicity and minimalist design. That's the unique thing about our game -- the players build the graphics! When the game ends, you'll have a neat looking system of roads crisscrossing the entire board.  \nWhen the game begins, keep a junction card in the middle and place the treasure randomly on the board - in various square slots. Make sure to keep the higher value coins far away from the center. Every time you play, come up with a different way to place the coins.\nThe Pirate  \nOne of you acts as a pirate. In all our trial runs, kids have actually been better pirates than adults! Give them a chance to manage the coins and trading of the junction tiles.\nThe Tiles\nThe tiles are the major components of this game. Players use the tiles to build roads from where others have left off. Each player takes two tiles blindly from the sack at each turn. Then, the player places them back to back (sequence them in a smart way to get to the treasure), building from one of the existing road endings. If your tile ends at a coin, you can grab that coin!  \nIn cooperative mode, players work together to grab as many coins as possible before the pirate does. When the pirate tile pops up from the sack, you will have to pick a card from the Pirate Tax deck. Pick one of the pirate's choices strategically so that you give him the least treasure.\nIn competitive mode, each player needs to make sure he does not make it easy for other players to grab coins - mislead them by building roads away from the treasure that you cannot reach!\nBridges and Junctions\nBuy these tiles from the Pirate Store to add branches and side paths to the existing roads. But think strategically - buying them makes sense only if you are going to get a reward higher than what you paid for them!\nWho Wins?\nThe game is over whenever you are out of coins on the board or you are out of road tiles. In the competitive mode, the player with the highest value of coins wins! In the cooperative mode, you win if have more coins than the pirate.\n    The Idea  \nWe got this idea for the game during winter break last year. We quickly created a prototype with paper and pencil and tried playing it. It was tough playing the game with paper tiles - the tiles would often move and it was difficult to keep them in place.\nThe First Prototype  \nThen, we made the first prototype with simple graphics and built it using the Game Crafter online site. We used this prototype to fine tune the game and the rules. We took this game to parties, forced everyone who visited our house to play with it and took valuable feedback. We were repeatedly told that the graphics needed to improve. Anika, the artist, started working on it very seriously using her iPad. She finally had the sketch for the game - it looked x100 better than our original prototype :)\nThe Production Game  \nWe went back and forth on the color and the theme and finally settled on a dark green theme (reminding us of the dark Amazon jungle). When we got the copy of the production prototype, we could not have been happier! The game looks sleek, and all the tiles and coins are of the highest quality!\n  As some of you already know, we are founders of MathandCoding.org, a non-profit dedicated to teaching kids of all ages how to code in local libraries.  \nWe are building this game mainly to support our efforts to expand MathAndCoding and reach out to kids outside of the Bay Area, teaching them coding and thinking skills. We plan to use the profits from this campaign and the sales of the board game to fund our trips to Mendocino and other counties outside of the SF Bay Area, where we will be teaching coding camps throughout the summer.\nThe statistics of crowdfunding are pretty unforgiving. Only one in twenty people who see this page will pledge. That means we need to reach out to hundreds of people to achieve our goal. Please share! The best way to do that is to post a link on Facebook/Twitter, or send an email with a link to a couple of friends you think might be interested. Thank you so much!\nFueled by our success with the codingFarmers board game, we designed a 'Coding is Good' Python card game for middle school children. This complements our online Python coding class. Python is a very popular programming language for beginners. It has gained momentum recently as a simple language for those who haven't coded before.\nIn this two-player game (ideal for kids in 5th grade and above), players challenge each other in their understanding of Python concepts. The game has three sets of cards. The Basic, the Intermediate, and the Advanced cards. At the beginning of the game, players divide each deck equally among themselves, The players challenge each other by picking cards strategically from their decks and asking the questions from the cards to their opponent. If you answer correctly, the card pile increases in size - but if you answer wrong, the whole stack goes to your opponent. After you run out of cards, whoever ends up with more cards wins!\nThis game cards also double as flash cards to reinforce the concepts learned from our online course.\nThis Python card game is a bonus reward for some tiers, so be sure to check it out!\nWe have already created several game prototypes and tried them out in after-school clubs and with friends. We've gone through two revisions for the treasure hunt game and four revisions for the Python card game.  \nWe are ready to launch full production of the game. We decided to go with The Game Crafter (TGC) for bulk manufacturing of our game. This means that the game will likely be in your hands within three weeks of funding!\nYour funds will help us launch our game on Amazon.\nThe campaign is fully funded now. But, we still have eight more days to go. We thought we would add a few stretch goals: \nIf we are able to raise $5500, we will add 24 more cards (to make it a 200 card deck) for our Coding is Good card game. In addition, we will also send out the PDF copies of our Coding is Good game to all the backers!!!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis project should not have any risks at all. A manufacturer (Game Crafter) based in the US will be making these games. So, you will see absolutely no delays due to international shipping, customs and other unforeseen obstacles associated with overseas production.\n\nWe have all the designs ready and uploaded on the Game Crafter website. As soon as we get the funding, we will do bulk order production. And you will have the games at your doorstep in less than three weeks!\n\nYou will get this game during summer vacation!

If you would like to pick up your EXTENDED PACK in Essen, please select Hungary as your shipping location in your pledge. We will send out a survey after the campaign and there you will be able to specify an Essen pick up.\nFREE Essen pickup: As we will have a booth this year too during the Essen Spiel we offer you to come to our booth and pick up your games personally. For the Essen pickups the ordered game quantity is unlimited.\nThe summarized shipping prices:\nMultiple orders: In order to offer the best possible deal, there is also a chance to add more games to you pledge.

If you're a retailer, please contact us at info@a-games.hu during the campaign for a private conversation.\nThis game is the first in our complex game series line. This game has been in the making since 2012, when the very first prototype was built. Since then the game went through many iterations and continuous balancing with hundreds of playtests. We are now ready to present it to you on Kickstarter! Please support us and let's make this dream come true together! :)\nWe release games with great value. This is our first kickstarter campaign, but definetly not our first venture into board game publishing. During the past two years we gathered valuable experience by successfully publishing two of our own games for international release, as well as several localized versions of other games from various publishers. We now understand all the processes and challenges of bringing a game to the market. We started small, released a card game and a bigger box game after that. With Dudab and Pi\u00f1ata Party we had the opportunity to learn all the important aspects of board game publishing. Now we are confident to deliver this beautiful and exciting game to you on time, in amazing quality.\nSome add-ons / expansions will be available after the campaign too, but only for an extra charge. The expansion modules will be priced at \u20ac5-\u20ac10 each after the campaign ends. Not to mention the ones that are only available as part of the Kickstarter campaign. Make sure not to miss out on them!\nIf you back us here on Kickstarter you will get the game sooner. The international distribution is a complex process so we cannot be sure when and where you will be able to buy the game through retailers. You will surely be able to buy the game during the next Spiel in Essen, but the PREMIUM edition will only be available during this campaign. You can only buy the RETAIL version later and maybe buy some add-ons for extra money. The production will start shortly after the end of the campaign, to make sure we can start sending out the games to you in August-September.\nThis game has been thoroughly tested, and the work is going on until the launch of production. We are confident that the gameplay is balanced and smooth. Our core playtesters are hardcore gamers with long years of experience.

This is a strategy game of programming actions by placing and retreiving workers, majorities, earning a little money and a lot of interaction between players.\nYou are a Vanuatuan who wants to prosper during the eight turns of the game. In order to do this, you will have to go fishing, discover treasures, buy and sell the local natural resources, and be on the lookout for tourists. To earn money or prosperity points, you may also draw on the sand*, or trade cargo with foreign countries.\n(*) Sand Drawing in Vanuatu belongs to the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity of the UNESCO. \n  Vanuatu (second edition) will contain both the 'Rising Waters' and 'Governor' mini-expansions. The 'Rising Waters' Expansion is also available as a standalone, the five submerged island tiles will be replaced by wooden parts. This way it is compatible with the old version of the game. The 'Governor' will not be available as a standalone expansion. \n  The game is language independent. Rules will be included in English, French, German and Dutch. You can review the rules by clicking the banner below.\n                For a more visual impression you can watch a video of how to play Vanuatu. Our friend at the Dice Tower, Ryan Metzler will give a great overview of the game.

Here's a brief description of the game.\nIn Pap\u00e0 Paolo, 2 to 4 players compete to deliver the most pizzas to the hungry customers of Naples. To do this, you must outsmart your rivals by being a clever investor, bidding on the right city tiles, and creating your own little district of Naples.  \nOver the course of five game rounds, players first have to plan their actions carefully, choosing whether they want to invest in new pizzerias, make express deliveries, get sponsored by the bank, or decide to expand their district. Once all players have used up their action tokens, players get rewarded by receiving Lira, which they can then use in a bidding phase to determine how many deliveries you can make, and how many pizzas you can deliver. Once you deliver pizzas to your hungry customers, they reward you by boosting your abilities, making each action more powerful as the game progresses. Every decision counts, but Pap\u00e0 Paolo is a very accessible game, which will charm players of all ages alike. \nThis campaign features a pretty easy pledge level structure. You can either pledge a single game, a combo deal or 6 games at once. You can gather people in your viscinity and group pledge to reduce shipping costs.

Read on to learn how to redeem your old pledge.\nPress-release:We fell in love with Vanuatu and decided to breathe new life into this forgotten gem. In our opinion the game required a makeover and we also wanted to include the mini-expansions the 'Rising Waters' & 'Governor'. We are aware that there had been fullfilment issues with the original publishers crowdfunding campaign. Although Quined Games had nothing to do with this, we have decided to give the unfortunate backers who never received their copy a generous compensation in the form of Vanuatu (second edition).\nEvery backer of the original campaign that did NOT receive their game (or the expansion) will receive their copy (or copies) for FREE. Yes, because we are nice that way. How will this work? Well, we kindly ask each one of the backers to send an e-mail to kickstarter@quined.nl with your full name, address, phone number, and a copy of the original e-mail you received during the original Ulule/Indiegogo campaign, clearly detailing the precise quantities of the copies that you ordered originally. The mail address mentioned in that original e-mail should be the one you send the e-mail from as proof. \nSince this is a gift to you previous backers, we do ask of you to cover the shipping costs. We hope you understand this. We will also arrange for a pick-up option at the following fairs: Spiel 2016 (DE), Spellenspektakel 2016 (NL), and Spel 2016 (BE). So shoot us an e-mail before 31-08-2016 and we will be in touch. (kickstarter@quined.nl)\n  For shipping we are currently working with a fullfilment partners based in Europe and North America.

Backers living outside the EU, US & Canada, may have customs taxes added. Although this usually does not happen for games, it is something we urge backers to take note of.\nWe like to support game stores around the world by offering them a special price for multiple copies of Vanuatu during the campaign. If you're a retailer, please contact me directly with a personal message on kickstarter for pricing information and manually make your pledge in full through Kickstarter during the campaign. \nVanuatu is a game that has been promised to fans before, by other parties, who never delivered. Quined Games was in no way affiliated with these former prints. We're looking to make things right, both for this beautiful game, its original fans and future backers.  \nTwo years ago, at Quined Games, Arno Quispel decided to publish Massilia. That game, by the same designer as Vanuatu, had never seen the printing press before that time. A successful Indiegogo page had been made, but somehow it never got published. Arno aquired the rights to this game and he published it, giving Massilia copies to duped backers.\nWe would like to do the same for Vanuatu. It was first released at Spiel Essen 2011. The quality was not up to par and fans demanded a reprint. This never happened. Now Quined Games has decided to print this game again. That is the reason you are reading this Kickstarter page. We wanted to change the look of the game. Make it look fresh and with pizazz! So Konstantin Vohwinkel offered to create new illustrations. He made a beautiful cover for Xanad\u00fa last year and that's how he got the job.\nAs some of you may know, Quined games is just a two man operation. We think that crowdfunding is a nice way to involve fans early on. The backers provide us with essential feedback, their involvement in the process lifts the game to a higher level.\nThis project would not have been possible without the help of Rafa\u00ebl Theunis, who started the work on making this game look as it is today. You can hear his voice in the introductionary video and half of the graphic design on this page has been made by him. Not to mention he managed all the rules translations and polishing them.\nWe would like to thank Konstantin Vohwinkel as well, he didn't just provide the game of a new look, but he was very vigilant in providing us with art for the kickstarter page. Thank you guys.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs mentioned above Quined has been in the board game publishing business for ten years now.

Shigeru Miyamoto's ultimate 8-bit platformer lived up to all the hype and elevated Mario from mascot to icon. But what exactly made this game the phenomenon it was?\nWith the help of her friends and family, critics inside and outside the realm of gaming, and former Nintendo of America employees, Alyse Knorr traverses the Mushroom World looking for answers. Along the way, Knorr unearths SMB3's connections to theater and Japanese folklore, investigates her own princess-rescuing impulses, and examines how the game's animal costumes, themed worlds, tight controls, goofy enemies, and memorable music cohere in a game that solidified Mario's conquest of the NES era.\nRead an early excerpt of this book now at Kotaku.\nAlyse Knorr teaches at the University of Alaska Anchorage. She is the author of two books and two chapbooks of poetry. She received her MFA from George Mason University and serves as a co-founding editor of Gazing Grain Press. Visit her at www.alyseknorr.com.\nMega Man 3 by Salvatore Pane\nCapcom's Keiji Inafune followed the unexpected success of Mega Man 2 with a \"kitchen sink\" sequel that included eight new robot masters, a canine companion, a mysterious new frenemy, and a melancholy tone that runs through the game from its soft opening notes. Mega Man 3 was the biggest, messiest, and most ambitious Mega Man game yet.\nBut why do we hunger for twitchy, difficult platformers like Mega Man 3 decades later when the developers, the franchise, and the Blue Bomber himself have all moved on, and why do we still revere the outmoded gaming consoles and cartridges on which the games were originally played?\nInvestigating the development of the Mega Man series with the rise of video game emulation, the YouTube retrogaming scene, and the soaring price of NES carts, novelist Salvatore Pane takes a close and compelling look at the lost power-ups of our youth that we collect in our attempts to become complete again.\nSalvatore Pane is the author of the novel Last Call in the City of Bridges. His work has appeared in American Short Fiction, Hobart, Buzzfeed, and many other venues. He's an assistant professor of English at the University of St. Thomas and can be reached at www.salvatore-pane.com.\nSoft & Cuddly by Jarett Kobek\nA computer game so nauseatingly gory that it came with a barf bag. Bright druggy graphics that sickened scores of proper English parents. Gameplay so violent that it inspired one of Britain's most infamous killing sprees. Soft & Cuddly, released for the ZX Spectrum in 1987, wasn't quite any of these things. But in an age of manufactured moral panics, John George Jones's fluorescent punk manifesto sure pissed off a lot of people.\nFeaturing new interviews with the the game's creator, Jarett Kobek's book dives deep into the gritty world of British yellow journalism, snarky computer fanzines, DIY home programming, and Soviet bootleg mixtapes. If Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party was right that \"video nasties\" like Soft & Cuddly were the epitome of 80s depravity, then this book is headed straight to hell.\nJarett Kobek a Turkish-American writer living in California. He's the author of four books including the novel I Hate the Internet, and the creator of an exclusive ZX Spectrum prequel of the same name.\nKingdom Hearts II by Alexa Ray Corriea\nLight and darkness. Heroes and villains. Final Fantasy epics and... Donald Duck? The Kingdom Hearts series has always walked a fine line between masterfully executed crossover and nonsensical fan mashup, but Square-Enix and Disney's inter-company franchise remains beloved throughout numerous sequels, prequels, and remixes. Despite the outlandish premise and convoluted lore, what lies at the heart of Kingdom Hearts is more than familiar to fans of Final Fantasy and Disney alike\u2014friendship.\nFor games critic and JRPG superfan Alexa Ray Corriea, no game in the series better exemplifies friendship than Kingdom Hearts II. Corriea's close reading of protagonist Sora's struggles and triumphs, his friendship with rival Riku, and his dark journey into oblivion illuminates how the unlikely universe of Kingdom Hearts authentically portrays human relationships better than any solo Final Fantasy or Disney game ever could. Just as Kingdom Hearts II is greater than the sum of its parts, Corriea's exploration of the game's themes and emotional depths reveals how much each of us is stronger for the people who surround us.\nAlexa Ray Corriea has been writing about video games professionally since 2011. As a high schooler she began her study of Japanese language and culture after a fateful encounter with some un-subtitled game footage on the internet, and has focused primarily on writing and analyzing Japanese games (and especially role-playing games) ever since. Her work has appeared online on G4, Polygon, and GameSpot.\nKatamari Damacy by L. E. Hall\nWhat kind of game would meditate on humankind's symbiotic relationship to nature by asking players to rip up entire mountain ranges by the root? Or criticize capitalism by letting us literally consume everything from a thumbtack to a streetlamp\u2014and have a great time doing it? Only a game that takes its silliness very seriously.\nBut the 2004 release of Katamari Damacy almost didn\u2019t get the ball rolling. Reviewers worldwide weren\u2019t sure how to classify it and initial sales numbers were low. Those who actually played it, though, were won over by its novel gameplay, goofy surrealism, and catchy soundtrack. Pushed into the mainstream by its passionate fans, Katamari remains one of the best video game examples of pure anarchic fun.\nBased on new interviews with staff including creator Keita Takahashi himself, game designer and writer L. E. Hall explores the game's development, lore, sequels, and cultural impact, examines Takahashi\u2019s body of work, and investigates the power of play itself.\nL. E. Hall is a writer, artist, and experiential designer focusing on the intersection of storytelling, play, and technology. Hall is the writer and game designer behind 60 Minutes to Escape\u2014Portland, Oregon\u2019s first escape-the-room puzzle game\u2014and serves on the board of directors for the Portland Indie Game Squad (PIGSquad).\nEach campaign, backers get a chance to elect the subject of one of our upcoming books.

What emerges is some firm yet friendly back and forth analysis that opens up a canonical videogame further than it ever has been before.\" 9/10 - Paste\nOn Shadow of the Colossus: \"Suttner's Shadow of the Colossus captures the essence, both mechanical and emotional, of what made the game so special.\" - IndieGames.com *** \"Well-written, well-researched, and enlightening ...I loved the book.\" - Cultured Vultures\nOn Spelunky: \"Maybe the best primer on game design ever written.\" - Zach Gage *** \"Spelunky might be our Understanding Comics.\" - Adam Saltsman\nYou can check out our Press page for more coverage, and read some five-star and one-star reviews of our books at Goodreads and Amazon.\nTry before you buy!

In this challenging, story-driven game for 1-6 players, you will play as group of civilians trapped in a city torn by a military conflict.\nTo survive, you will need to make tough moral choices, delivered in a role-playing style. You will also scavenge, manage, fight, trade and upgrade your shelter. This tabletop adaptation is based on one of the biggest indie games of recent years. TWOM: TBG offers you an experience that is hard to come by in any other tabletop game. Combined with the highest quality components created by experienced companies, this title will fully engage you with its meaningful story. It is high time for board games to address important topics.\nThis War Of Mine is an award-winning (over 100 awards) digital game, built around a far-reaching message:\nIN WAR, NOT EVERYONE IS A SOLDIER.\nImagine you wake up one day and the streets you used to walk are now in ruins. Rules and laws no longer apply. Your very existence is at stake now \u2013 the city is cut-off and if you want to survive, you must find food, medicine and weapons. Will you prey on the weak, or will you try to keep your morality?\n                          We really believe that with this board game we\u2019ve created a tabletop experience different from what you have seen so far. \nTo confirm it, we have sent out 50 prototypes to various reviewers across the globe, and during the Kickstarter campaign we will post the feedback, for you to see.\nRahdo runs final thoughts\nThanks to the design, colorful journal and the very nature of the components of this game, you can start playing immediately after setting up all the elements on the board - you learn more as you go. Sometimes you will need to trust your instincts and make gut calls, this adds a layer of immersion to the game, since at war you can never be sure if the decision you made was correct. \nThe Book of Scripts added to the game, will consist of over a 1 000 unique adventures that were written to evoke a range of emotions. Some of them will have direct influence on the gameplay, some not - but all of them will raise your level of immersion, so that you can feel what a group of civilians would feel being trapped in a in a war-torn city. \nA system of events that were designed never to repeat in the same sequence. Every playthrough will be a unique and and exciting experience. The game will adjust the events you face depending on your current situation, place and time. Every game will be personal. \n At night you will go out and scavenge, searching for food, parts, meds and weapons. During the day you will try to make the best of your resources. Deadly combat, trading, shelter management, tinkering, building and side events - it is all here and you need to learn fast to reach your ultimate goal. Survival. \nIn life, every choice we make has consequences. We translated this into the aftereffect mechanics, where the game remembers the decisions you make and will force you to face their consequences when you least expect it. \nAs an addition to the board game, it will be fully optional and will have no direct impact on the gameplay. It will provide additional stories and more immersion helpers! Thanks to the possibilities offered by smartphones and tablets, you will be able to discover illustrations, music, audio dramas and video recordings. \nThe game is a full co-op, where all players are responsible for all the characters. They need to discuss and try to agree on the best course of action. At any moment of the game, the player holding the Journal will make the final decision and, after his or her phase, the Journal will be passed on to the next player. \nWe are working with some of the best companies on the market that have over 15 years of experience in creating board games. All components (excluding miniatures) will be produced in Europe (Poland) where we will have direct access to the whole production process and oversee it from it's beginning to the end. \nThe game's length can be easily modified, but for those of you who want to plunge into a full campaign mode we have created the save game mechanism. It will enable you to save your progress at any time. So you will be able to pick up right where you left off! \n(To see extended gameplay, click here) \n\"Trying to help them through a horrific situation is an emotional experience, not just because you feel responsible for their pain, but because you share some joy in the small ways you make their lives better.\" -  A.V.

VAT tax for European Union is included in the price and because of no VAT tax regulations for countries outside of EU we are able to offer cheaper shipping prices.\nFirst of all - you are pledging to bring this project to life. Without your support this game will be not see daylight. But if we will meet our target easily, we will be adding special content and components to every copy of the game. \nTo keep things simple - your Kickstarter edition will be far richer then the one that will be available in retail.

You are one of the animal-shaped merchants competing to become the next Trade Master in this highly adaptive deck building game. The game supports 2\u20134 players and playing time is around 20 to 30 minutes.\n  Every card can be used in multiple ways providing the players with tough and meaningful choices. Do you give up a chance to use a splendid action in favor of getting even more astounding cards? You can't win the game without letting go of your cards.\nThe goal of the game is to finish up your merchant stall before anyone else. The first player to do so, wins the competition and is chosen as the new Trade Master in the free trade city.\nWith 6 different decks, the replayability of the game is extremely high. You get fresh gameplay by mixing various decks from game to game. The decks from Dale of Merchants 2 can be played with the original Dale of Merchants which brings the total amount of decks to 12! This introduces a whole new set of combos and possibilities.\n    The funding goal is set so that we can produce the game with extremely high quality components, including heavy card stock with linen finish. These cards are meant to last! We include the whole experience, if we reach our funding goal\nThis is why the stretch goals are mostly about small improvements to the game \u2013 it is complete and full without any of them. That being said, we do have one huge stretch goal, if we pass our last campaign's funding.\nAll stretch goals marked with \"Promo!\" are included for free in each pledge level containing a physical game. You'll receive one of these for each copy of Dale of Merchants 2. These promos will be available after the campaign for additional price in limited quantities.\nThe game is ready and heavily playtested. About 95 % of the artwork for the game is and ready for print. We will finalize everything during and after this campaign, taking backer feedback into account. This will allow us to minimize delays and deliver the game to all the backers as reliably and fast as possible.\nRetailers interested in the game should contact us directly by a private message or by email (info@snowdaledesign.fi).\n    \"So whether you are looking to try your first deck building game or looking to replace that copy of Dominion that you can never convince people to play, in Dale of Merchants 2 you will find a game that is a menagerie of fun!\"\nStuart Dunn, CatholicMom.com (Written review)\n\"The artwork in the game is phenomenally good. \u2013 Using cards for different things brings more depth and makes each card very useful in various ways.

You can find instructions on printing the files below.\nPrint with page scaling disabled. The PDFs are not sized to a specific paper size so it will work equally well for both US Letter and UK A4. If you are planning on printing double-sided, allow your PDF reader to center the page. If you want to make card backs, simply print 13 copies of the card back PDF as the animal deck file is 10 pages and the junk deck is 3. They all use the same card back image.\nThere's also a public link to the Google Docs version of the rules. It's there for you to make comments and give feedback. It's extremely handy as you can add a comment to a specific part of the rules and I'm able to answer to your ideas.\n          The correct shipping costs are added automatically to your pledge based on your country. It's $5 per game to almost everywhere in the world.\nWe expect to fulfill all the rewards ourselves, from Finland. EU backers do not have to worry about customs or VAT.\nShipments to non-EU backers will have 19 EUR declared as the value of the package (shipping included). That's roughly equivalent to 21.6 USD / 28.5 CAD / 28.7 AUD / 20.7 CHF / 2390.7 JPY, and should be under the threshold that triggers customs duties in most countries.\nIf everything goes as planned, you will get the game this year. The estimated delivery of the physical game is set to October 2016 to take possible delays into account. We prefer to deliver either early or on time rather than overpromise and be late.\n  You can see our project timeline above. Anything after this Kickstarter project is an estimate.

It takes just a few minutes to learn the basics, seconds to setup and 30-60 minutes to play.\nDiscounted Price: The MSRP for the base game will likely be $55-60, but if the 1st and 2nd Stretch Goals are reached (adding Custom wooden components and plastic miniatures), the MSRP will be $65-70! All of which will be available to you at the same low pledge amount.\nShipping Discounts: By absorbing a portion of the shipping fees ourselves, we are charging a flat $13 fee (for each game) for all backers, no matter where they may live on the planet!\nEU Friendly: We are offering an additional $6 discount to our supporters in the EU to help offset the VAT fees. (See \"Shipping\" below.)\nQuality Production: Rather than to simply look for the cheapest way to produce our game, we have tried to strike a balance. Though we do have a couple Stretch Goals that will definitely enhance the gaming experience, the base game will not be made with cheap, flimsy materials.\nInstead, the Box = 1157gsm*; the Tiles = 1500gsm (nice and thick); the Player Cards and Station Cards = 310gsm (blackcore) and Player Screens = 400gsm. These thicker components will help the game to have a better feel and to hold up under lots and lots game nights! In addition, all printing will be glossy with linen finish. \n*(1000gsm is approximately 1.5mm) \nAll manufacturing will done by WinGo Games in China. They have been in the business of printing Board Games for over 20 years. We have been in discussion with them for months and we are ready to go as soon as we are funded!\nSector Prime is a 4x game for 2-4 players (a 5-6 player version is one of our Stretch Goals listed below). We said that this is a \"casual\" game, that's not in the sense that is a serene, relaxing game. No, rather it is in comparison with some of them complex 4x games that take hours and hours to play. But rest assured even in the 30-60 minutes that you'll play a game there will be conflict, intense decision making and most of all fun!\nWhat is a 4x game? It consists of 4 basic elements of game play, explore, expand, exterminate and exploit. In Sector Prime these four elements are divided into the 3 phases of each turn described below.\nIn the game each player takes on the role of a mining company seeking to increase it\u2019s profits by establishing operations in a new sector of space. \nIn Phase 1 (the move phase) you explore and secure planets within the sector. \nIn Phase 2 (the battle or build phase) you will have to decide between either exterminating the competition who are preventing you from carrying out your mining operations or expanding your control by building refineries, jump bridges, force fields or the Mining Control Station. \nIn Phase 3 (the mine phase) you will exploit the Traxium crystals from the planets under your control. \nEach planet tile has Asteroid Fields and Ion Storms which impede movement to other tiles. Randomly laying the tiles for each game creates a unique playing area creating naturally defended regions or open routes to other systems. \nBelow are just a few of the hundreds of different possible layouts.\nInitially you will be focused on securing nearby systems and gathering Traxium crystals. After a few turns rival corporations may begin to battle for the systems under your control, while others defend their planets by building Force Fields and starting construction on their own Stations. Your challenge will be striking a balance between expanding your domain, slowing down your opponents, and completing your Station. \nBe the first player to complete construction of your Mining Station and you will have achieved the title of Sector Prime and won the game!\nConstruction of Mining Station\nSector Prime is a lightweight game that is easy to learn for newer gamers, but provides enough strategic depth to keep seasoned gamers engaged. \nWe've had a lot of play testing over the last couple years!\n Download the Rule Book\nIf you'd like to try out Sector Prime now, a download of the Print-n-Play version of the game as well as access to Sector Prime on Tabletopia* are available at every pledge level.\nWhat is a \"Print-n-Play\" version?\nThis is a pdf file that you can download and print out. The components of the game then need to be cut out. For Sector Prime you will also need to supply some common components yourself.\nWhat is Tabletopia?\nTabletopia is a way to play many popular board games on your computer. It simulates an table and all the components of the game. You cannot play against the computer, but you can play with other players all over the world! It itself was funded on Kickstarter last year and it is currently in Beta. \nWe will be allowing our supporters free access* to Sector Prime for at least the duration of the campaign and perhaps until the physical games are shipped. *This access is also subject to possible changes in the Beta phase of Tabletopia and will be out of our control.\nLance Myxter from Undead Viking\n\"This is a very, very fun 4x game, but it's not like any 4x game that I've really played prior to this one.\"\nWatch Lance's review below for an excellent description of the game, the strategy involved as well his explanation of why he likes Sector Prime!\nFather Geek\n\"A very pleased Gamer Geek said, \u201c[Sector Prime] is tight and well-balanced. It plays fast and kept me engaged. I liked how the game\u2019s difficulty kept increasing, making me work harder and harder for my goals.\u201d\" \n(Full written review)\nGiancarlo & Felicia from Board To Death TV\nThe GM's from Gameapalooza\n\"This could be an awesome little game, it looks nice even in the prototype, with great character art and nice planetary cards.\"\n(Full Written Review)\nChristoph Richter from Boardgaming for the Win\n\"I do like a good 4X game. Most 4X games can take hours upon hours just to play. Some even take a good thirty minutes to an hour to just setup. Sector Prime is different though. A good different. It takes only a few minutes to set up & just up to an hour or less to play. Sector Prime satisfies the gamer palate when it comes to one of the mighty 4X games already on the market.\"\n(Full Written Review)\nAlexander Resch from Board Game Junkies Preview [GERMAN]\nBelow you will find items that you can add on to your pledge. You will need to add the cost manually in the Pledge Manager. If you have any questions please ask in the Comments section.\nWe struggled with the best way deal with shipping to a worldwide audience. We could have provided \u201cFree Shipping\u201d but that simply raises the cost of the game. Instead we have opted to charge a flat $13 fee for all backers, for just about anywhere they may live on the planet!\nThe exception is for those of you who reside in the countries within the EU, you have an added burden, VAT. Due to our simplified shipping process direct from China it would have raised shipping prices in order to import the games in bulk. So instead we are offering a special shipping discount for the EU. This will be $6 cheaper thus assisting you in covering the VAT. We hope that this will help us to gain more support from backers within the EU and beyond!\nOne final note on shipping. An unexpected perk to those who purchase the 5 game bundle is that the games will be shipped via Express, thus giving you your games up to two weeks before the standard shipping! This is because of a stipulation of the shipping company, but certainly works in your favor.\n                                                                  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBecause Sector Prime is our first project, there may be some obstacles in front of us. However, we have spent years preparing the game itself and the last 6 months researching and having lengthy discussions with the manufacturing and shipping companies in China. We are confident that we have everything planned out and ready to go. Publishing a board game is not easy, but we are as prepared as we can be and ready for any challenges that may arise.\n\nWe are hoping for a successful campaign and we thank you ahead of time for all your support!\n\nTo avoid long delays after the Kickstarter campaign, we have already prepared the majority of our graphic files and the remaining assets should be completed about the time the campaign ends, so production will be able to begin swiftly. \n\nThe game will be produced by Wingo Games. They are one of the experts in the field of board game production and are eager to get started on this project. We have communicated a lot over the past months and weeks.

Be sure to \"Contact Me\" to get an answer >>>>>\nIn 2012 Rikki Tahta took the gaming world by storm with the release of Coup, a game of secret identities, bluffing and deduction.  In the years since, Coup has been become a fan favorite and a best seller for publishers around the world.  Many of the languages in which Coup has been published have used different artwork, inspired by a diverse set of local artistic culture. \nIndie Boards and Cards is very excited to work with artist Weberson Santiago and publisher Funbox to release an English language edition featuring the fantastic artwork from the Brazilian version.  This limited release includes the Allegiance and Inquisitor mechanics from the Reformation expansion in a single box that we call the Coup Deluxe Edition - Brazil Art. \nCoup Deluxe Edition Brazil Art contains everything needed to play the game:  15 role cards (each card features a unique character illustration), 30 Coins (Values of 1 and 5), 6 double sided player aids.   \nCoup Deluxe Edition Brazilian Art also includes the Inquisitor & Allegiance mechanics from Reformation: 3 inquisitor role cards, 6 allegiance cards, 1 treasury reserve card.   All the cards are Tarot sized (oversized) to highlight the fantastic artwork of this great game. \nAs a special reward for those backing this project, we are including 6 extra character cards (one of each role) featuring unique art for each character.  We also have included additional player aids and allegiance cards.  This allows you to play with up to 8 players. \nAfter this kickstarter, Copies of Coup Deluxe Edition Brazilian Art will only be available directly from Indie Boards and Cards via Amazon in the US.  Coup Deluxe Edition Brazilian Art may not ever be sold via distribution (and will certainly not be sold via distribution until Q4 2017 at the earliest).   If Coup Deluxe Edition Brazilian Art is eventually released into distribution, the promos will not be included in that retail version.\n This project already lists everything that will be included!   \nWe are only making this special edition of this great game for the biggest fans of Coup and Santiago's artwork.  Kickstarter really is a great platform to do that through - without kickstarter we could really only offer these promo items to the limited number of people that attend big events like GenCon and Essen. \nWhat are Kickstarter Funds used for?\nYour pledge dollars go directly into making the pledge rewards, and shipping them to you. We have invested in getting the project to this point where it's ready; your support ensures that we have the cash to pay our printers to make the games - the most costly part of game production.\nAs a special reward for kickstarter backers and as a result of the advances we\u2019ve made in reducing shipping costs within the US & Canada, we are able to offer great prices when adding some of our older titles when you pledge for Don't Mess with Cthulhu. Note - we are no longer able to support Add-Ons outside of US & Canada. \nAfter this project is closed, we will open Add-ons via paypal for backers. DO NOT ADD $ TO YOUR PLEDGE FOR ADD-ONS. Add-ons are for retail editions of the games listed below (no promos included) and will be sent with your rewards from this project (in September).\nAll of the games that we offer in the add-on program are available right now at your local game store:\nThe Resistance\nThe Resistance: Hidden Agenda (Resistance Expansion)\nThe Resistance: Hostile Intent (Resistance Expansion)\nThe Resistance: Avalon\nCoup\nCoup: Reformation (Coup Expansion)\nCoup Rebellion G54 (Stand Alone Game)\nOne Night Revolution\nMelee\nFlash Point Fire Rescue\nUrban Structures (Flash Point Expansion)\n2nd Story (Flash Point Expansion)\nExtreme Danger (Flash Point Expansion)\nDangerous Waters (Flash Point Expansion)\nVeteran & Rescue Dog (Flash Point Expansion)\nHaggis\nDragon Slayer\nRoar-a-Saurus\nOur plan is to have Coup Deluxe Edition Brazilian Art ready in time for GenCon and available at Essen. While our current production schedule looks like kickstarter rewards will ship out well before GenCon, it may be the case that we have games at GenCon before the kickstarter backer copies are sent. It may also be the case that we are unable to get games to GenCon or Essen in time. I wish we were able to absolutely guarantee results - but we simply know that we can't make such commitments when so many other parties are involved in the process. \nIf you want GenCon or Essen pickup - DO NOT PLEDGE FOR THIS PROJECT - all you have to do is sign up for our GenCon email list by giving an email address here: http://eepurl.com/RzSlX or sign up for our Essen email list by giving an email address here: http://eepurl.com/RzQE9. Shortly before each event, we will ask you what you would like to reserve for Thursday pick up (note we cannot handle prepaid reservations or hold items past Thursday).\nThe promo items will be available in the games we bring to GenCon/Essen - your support is very valuable to Indie Boards and Cards and we look forward to seeing you again this year with lots of great new games.\nCombined Shipping\nWe are also offering a special \"COMBINED SHIPPING\" levels for this project, if you backed the Grifters and/or Don't Mess with Cthulhu project(s) at any of these levels:\n$25/$15 US Shipping\n$30/$20 CDN Shipping\n$35/$25 European (EU Friendly)\n$40/$30 Australian\n$75/$65 Priority International\nThe $20 and $24 COMBINED SHIPPING pledge levels are only available to these backers. If you did not back Grifters and/or Don't Mess with Cthulhu at one of the above levels, then please do not back at the combined shipping levels. If you have a question about whether you are eligible to back at this reduced shipping level please ask. If you back at this level and are not eligible, then you will not only have to pay the shipping costs difference but will pay an additional $20 fee.\nWe are very excited to be continuing our international partnerships with Snakes & Lattes, BoardGameGuru to offer Canadian & EU Friendly shipping options as well as shipping options for Australia. \nFor most of the rest of the world we will offer two levels of shipping services to give you options between cost, speed and success. Unfortunately, international shipping is costly, takes time and is open to a number of potential issues and delays. While we try to use shipping services providers that are both effective and cost efficient, we are not in the shipping business and must rely upon outside providers and postal services to get games to you. This year we offer either ECONOMY or PRIORITY shipping choices - please be sure that you read the significant restrictions that come with each option!\nWe also realize that for many international backers our best option will be to buy the retail edition of this game when it arrives in your local game store. It may be the case that everyone is happier and enjoys our great games without having endured the hassles of international shipping ;)\nECONOMY Shipping\nFor several years we have sent international packages by FEDEX International Mail Service (FIMS). FIMS items are packed in the US, sent to Sweden on a space-available basis and then sent to the postal system in your destination country, again on a space-available basis. This has been reasonably reliable, and an inexpensive service, oftentimes items arrive in as little as 2 weeks.\nHowever, delivery times and success rates can be highly variable. In 2015 we had a much higher rate of delay and missing packages - though 90% of the packages still arrived within a reasonable time period and many of the items that were initially reported as lost were later delivered. So while it is not perfect, it is cheaper than other options.\nIf you select this option you are agreeing to these conditions:\nThere are no tracking numbers, or individual shipping confirmation emails. While I will notify you that your items have been sent, you are agreeing to my commitment that these items are sent as there is no verifiable confirmation of shipment.\nExpected delivery time is up to 6 months after shipment. You are signing up to having a delivery address that is fixed for a long time frame. You are also agreeing in advance to being extremely patient and acknowledging that it is very likely that the retail version of this game (without the promos) will be available in your local store before you receive your kickstarter rewards.\nThere is no guarantee of delivery. If your items do not arrive within 3 months (which is the case 5-10% of the time) you can have items resent via USPS Priority Mail, paying the full shipping and handling fee for the item (about $60), to the same address you submitted in the kickstarter survey for this project. That is the only option for items not received - there are no other options that will be available to you.\nIf these conditions are not legally binding in your country, then you are not eligible to select this level of service.\nI know that these restrictions are hard, that is why I am making them perfectly clear as I intend to uphold them. If you don't agree to these shipping restrictions, please either 1) choose the PRIORITY shipping service offered, 2) use a parcel freight forwarder to have items sent to a US address and then to you or 3) wait for the retail edition of this game to make it to your local game store.\nPRIORITY Shipping\nThis is a higher cost service that offers shipping confirmation, tracking numbers and delivery confirmation via the US Postal Service's Priority International Mail. Delivery can take as little as a week after shipment - but depends largely on the custom processing times in your country.\nWhile this shipment service offers many benefits over ECONOMY shipping, it does still have restrictions:\nExpected delivery time is up to 2 months after shipment. You are signing up to having a delivery address that is fixed for that period of time.\nYou provide your address to me and confirm that it is both a valid address and safe for packages to be left. You are responsible for items that are sent to an old address, returned as undeliverable or unknown address, unclaimed items when required to be picked up at the post office, or items that are marked as delivered but not received. In these cases these items will only be resent at your expense.\nIf you don't agree to these shipping restrictions, please either 1) use a parcel freight forwarder to have items sent to a US address and then to you or 2) wait for the retail edition of this game to make it to your local game store.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIndie Boards and Cards recently completed a kickstarter project for Grifters and Don't Mess with Cthulhu, those projects are scheduled to be delivered in August of 2016. We have a track record of delivering multiple projects in a timely manner and do not foresee any issues with doing so again\n\nIndie Boards and Cards has successfully delivered a number of previous kickstarter projects to thousands of supporters. We expect that our previous experiences will enable us to also deliver this project on time.\n\nHave a question? Be sure to \"Contact Me\" to get an answer >>>>> While I do read the comments, I will not answer questions nor post into the comments section. The comments section(s) may, in fact I can guarantee that it will, contain inaccurate information. It is very easy for you to ask me a question and get an email response, so please do.\n\nThat said, there are always complexities and considerations in a project of this scope that may cause delays. Indie Boards and Cards will use contract manufacturing to make this game, freight forwarders to get games through customs and 3rd parties like Amazon, the US Post Office and FEDEX to ship the games to you - we don't control everything and there are lots of opportunities for delay. Other conditions may also cause delays - earthquakes, alien invasions, asteroid attacks, zombie plague are but a few of the myriad of reasons we may not be able to deliver this project in a timely manner.\n\nThis is a first edition of the game - by pledging to this project you are agreeing to be an early adopter and the extra promo items that are included in this edition (that aren't in the retail version) are your rewards and incentives for being an early adopter. But even with multiple edits, and constant proofing, there may be minor typos, or grammar usage that is annoying to you in your rewards or other little things that would have been nice to have avoided but don't affect how the game is played. Mistakes that materially affect game play will of course be addressed but sometimes there are minor errors that might be distracting but do not affect game play that I can't justify correcting. So if minor errors get under your skin and make it itch then you probably don't want to be an early adopter and are better off waiting till you've had a chance to see the final product and then buy it in your local hobby store. Kickstarter is not for everyone and I leave it to you to decide if you should be getting in on a first edition of this game.\n\nMy pledge is that I will deliver what I said and have written this project page as concisely and clearly as I can. So please read everything on this page - every kickstarter project is unique, and the commitments I am making to you regarding this project are completely defined here. If you don't see that I have made a commitment to do something, then I haven't committed to do that - please don't assume that I have. You can always send a message and ask me.\n\nA particular challenge to a project like this is negativity - I love your input, and really enjoy all the great suggestions that come from the large majority of our supporters. I can't include all the suggestions that I get, nor can I give you specific feedback other than noting that I do read all the comments and messages sent to me. So think before you post - threats, ultimatums and entitlement are unlikely to get you what you are asking for, and very likely that everyone else (myself included) will get less.\n\nRefunds - Things happen and sometimes you need to get your money back. If you ask (before it's been submitted for shipment to you), I'll refund your pledge less 20% to cover the costs that I can't recoup and the costs of processing that refund. So think before you pledge - you can of course always remove your pledge before the funding deadline, but don't expect to get a 100% refund just because you forgot to remove your pledge before the project end ;)\n\nChanges - Images shown here are of the final art; however, while it is not expected, changes may be made before final production both to the art work and game contents. Variations in the production process and monitor calibration may cause alterations from the screen images to what appears in physical form.\n\nProduction variability - While efforts are made to ensure that all versions of games are compatible with previous versions and expansions, there is no practical way to ensure that this happens. Variations in the production process can result in differences in colors, textures and materials between print editions and occasionally within a single print run. Some variation should be expected that may necessitate that measures such as using card sleeves be used to hide these minor production variations.\n\nHave an issue? Send me a note - and please don't support us if you aren't satisfied with what the project is returning to you. Nothing would make me happier than having 100% of my supporters 100% satisfied with their pledge rewards!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #8", "update_userinfo": "Ready for more amazing art from Weberson Santiago?", "update_content": "We're back with the latest social deduction game by Don Eskridge, designer of The Resistance and Avalon."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #7", "update_userinfo": "Shipping Complete!!!", "update_content": "Yes, everything has been sent!

It can be learned in just a few minutes, but has a tremendous amount of depth. The box contains enough content for 2 players to play immediately, or you can unlock nearly limitless deck-building options by combining Clash with our previous game \"Gruff\". A game we successfully Kickstarted last year!\nA Brutal Battle System- Clash's combat mechanics create a constant state of counter-play. When an enemy attacks, you have your entire turn to dodge out of the way, mount your defenses, and launch a counterattack before the attack connects!\nCustomize Your Herd- Create a team of three monster-goats that begin the game in play, and stay in play, throughout the game. They are your source of damage, defense, and resources! Carefully choose from their cards to create your ultimate deck!\nThe Next Evolution of Combat- Each turn your goats can mutate. They get Meaner, Weirder, and Fatter; rapidly raising the stakes of the game. Each decision can be the the difference between life and death as the pace of the game builds up to a crisis!\nClash is a stand-alone \"Gruff\" game. Gruff has been honored with several awards. \nIn Praise of Clash\n\"I like the art, I like the theme. It is highly competitive, highly intuitive, highly strategic, and a heck of a lot of fun!\"\n-Lance Myxter, Undead Viking Videos\n \"Games become this horrific snowball of teeth and ooze the longer fights go on. It's GLORIOUS.\"   \n-Jason Dobson, Indie Cardboard\n \"Simple. Easy. Quick. Studio Woe has done a great job of making a tight, streamlined competitive card game with Clash of the Battle Goats; it\u2019s a breeze to teach and to modify, and with the few mechanical tweaks from Gruff it really provides a fast-paced experience with some good strategic depth.\"\n-Ben Duerksen, CoG Gaming\n\"Clash works as a great introduction point into previously released Gruff. Cards can be used from both games to add even more combos.\"\n-Josh Eisbrenner, so1ks\nIn Praise of Gruff\n\"In every sense, Gruff has been a labor of love for the folks working on it, and you can see it in every monstrous detail of the fun but terrifying art style. Gruff\u2018s simple concepts allow for both new gamers to have a competitive card game experience, while still giving seasoned players the depth of a full collectible card game.\" \n- ROBERT HORNBEK, Geek & Sundry\n\"What I like most about Gruff is how it speed-injects the feeling of other constructed deck games in its own tight format. I was a big Magic player for a long time, and what I loved most about it was playing big creatures and cool spells. Gruff distills the constructed experience, with the creatures providing the mana and lots of synergies between cards, so that you get a lot of that satisfying feel at a fraction of the time investment.\"\n-Andrew Fisher, Gameosity\n\"A card game stemming from the likes of Magic, but similarities end with the cards. Gruff is a mix up of Cube Draft style, deck building, and Commander mode, and adding in a few mechanics of poker to outplay your enemy, while having a bit of a miniatures feel to it as well.\"\n-Bobby C.

Four of the major civilizations inhabiting the galaxy finally achieved interstellar travel, and are ready to establish their empires and dominance across the galaxy!\nYour civilization is among them. As a leader, you must make sure your rising empire is the dominant at the end! You will accomplish this by colonizing planetary systems and exploring beautiful nebulae with your ships while establishing your domain.\nPlan your strategy wisely to become the most prosperous star empire of the galaxy!\n3d Image by: Chris Green (bgg user: Menaveth)\nSmall Star Empires is a quick area control game for 2-4 players. In this game, players control spacefaring civilizations that colonize the galaxy using their ships, which they will move on a modular board containing hexagon spaces (systems). The modular board is made up of 7 different double-sided Sector Tiles, which allows for a different map and different experience each time you play the game:\nPlayers are encouraged to make their own variations of board setups!\nFor instance, by using the Wormhole tiles, you can even create an \"Island Galaxies\" board:\nAnd, because of the modularity of the board, you can also combine the Sectors Tiles of two copies of the game to create A MASSIVE EPIC GALAXY to play in!\nThere are several types of systems in the game:\nDuring a turn, a player must move one of his ships on the board. He can only move the ship in a straight line, as far away as he wants, but he cannot go over systems controlled by other players. After moving the ship, the player has to choose whether to place a Colony or a Trade Station in that system. Both of these mark control over the system for until the end of the game but the Trade Station is better because it gives the player bonus points for each adjacent system controlled by your opponents.\nExample of possible movement:\nExplanation: The blue player wants to colonize the 3 Planet system shown here. He cannot do it with his ship from his homeworld system, because it is being blocked by the red player, so he chooses to move his other ship onto that system. He can then place either a Colony or a Trade Station, but he chooses to place a Trade Station, because besides the system points, he will get an additional +1 bonus point for each adjacent opponent's system (in this case +3).\nGame End:\nThe game ends when either all of the players have placed their Colonies and Trade Stations on the board or until none of the players' ships can move legally (they became blocked by other players\u2019 systems).\nAfter the game ends, points are calculated. Each player gets one point for each planet that he has in his systems (there are systems with 1 to 3 planets on the board). Players also get points for Nebulae \u2013 the more they have from one color the more points they would get, and they add their bonus points from other special systems such as the Unexplored System Tiles, which are a part of a variant in the game.\nAfter calculating the points, the player with the most points is the winner!\nClick HERE to see a rules preview.\nESSEN SPIEL 2015  \nWe went to Essen Spiel last year to present and demo Small Star Empires at the Author's Workshop, and we had a really great time there! All of the people that played the game loved it and some were eager to buy a copy! You can read more about our experience at the fair on our blog HERE.\nLance, Undead Viking:\n\"The game is just fantastic! It's a lot of fun, it's light admittedly, it is kind of in that micro-game world, but it is a really, really tough  to win. You're always going to be challenged as far as to which ship you want to move, where you want to move to and how are you going to do your move to affect your opponent.\"\n Nick Meenachan, Board Game Brawl:\n\"This game is going to be good for people who want the space variant theme but want it in a simple, faster time-frame but also want deterministic gameplay as opposed to just random dice shucking and whoever wins is the person who was the luckiest.\"\nMatt Simpson, Flaming Dice Reviews (FULL WRITTEN REVIEW):\n\u201cTurns in Small Star Empires are fast and games are quick. What seems like a large playing area gets congested fast and before you know it players are out of moves and scoring begins. The strategy draws you in completely and I, for one, love that type of game. Small Star Empires is highly engaging, easy to learn, and quick to play; on top of that, the artwork for the game tiles is beautiful. I will most definitely be backing this game when the Kickstarter Campaign launches!\u201d \nHere is the full video review by Matt:\nJim Goff from Board Nerds says \"It's a buy!\":\n\"It's super fun! Something really satisfying about going through and moving your ship and trying to figure out where you want to go, what places you want to lock down. Final verdict: It's a buy!\"\nThe guys from Epitrapaizoume had fun:\n Bronson Shipp, designer and reviewer, All Father Games:\n\u201cWe really did enjoy your game, in particular how passive aggressive we could play. Very fun area control, with surprising balance for how in depth the scoring is.\u201d\nJohnny, Dice Settlers (FULL WRITTEN REVIEW):\n\u201cWe played this in a prototype form in advance of a kickstarter release somewhere next year but I can\u2019t wait for it because in my opinion this was a great game and for us easily the most fun experience of the fair [Essen Spiel 2015]. The game plays really easy and yet has a lot of depth and strategic decisions to be made.\u201d \n Smarter Backer Golden Badger:\nIn this variant of the game, the Unexplored System tiles are shuffled and then placed on the empty systems of the board face down. The rule is simple - when you enter an Unexplored System, simply reveal it and resolve it's effect. For instance, Asteroid Fields do damage to your ships, or you may encounter a Chromatic Nebula, which you can count towards any one combination of Nebulae to get more points at the end of the game.\nDELUXE CONTENT UNLOCKED WITH THIS STRETCH GOAL!\nAdds 3 extra Unexplored System tiles - The Minor Civilizations. Each of these tiles represents a unique minor civilization with unique abilities and effects! \nWe had a friend of ours print out some prototype plastic components for the game. Even though printed on a home 3d printer, they still looked amazing, and gave us the idea how awesome the real plastic components would look! Here are some pics of the prototype pieces in real life:\nDistributors and retailers that want to buy more than 5 copies can contact us on archonagames@gmail.com\nWhere it will be produced?\nThe game will be produced by Wingo Games!

Each aspect of Sovrano was meticulously designed and everything is handmade; many hours and a lot of care is put into each and every game in order to make sure the final product is amazing!  We are very proud of Sovrano and excited to share it with you!\nSovrano is a game for two players.  It is a straight-forward and easy to learn game of strategy and cunning. However, beneath the relative simplicity lies a depth of complexity that will keep the game interesting and re-playable. \nThe object of the game is to be the player that scores the most points by capturing one or both of the tower-spaces located at opposite ends of the middle row. Players must also protect their emperors and attempt to move them to the board\u2019s center space \u2013 the throne.  Each player has 1 emperor, 8 guards to protect him and capture towers with, and 2 archers that supply support fire from a distance. A typical game of Sovrano will last between 15 and 30 minutes.\nCheck out the video below to learn more about the rules and how Sovrano is played!\nPLAY\n\nEach game includes the game board, 22 playing pieces (11 per player), 30 point counters, and the rulebook.\nThe Sovrano rules can also be found in PDF!  Here!\n \"I had an absolute blast playing Sovrano. I hope that you won't look at it and think \"It looks too simple.\" It's not. I hope you won't think \"It's just a smaller game of chess.\" It's not. It's stress-inducing, anxiety-causing fun made from a tree...\" - Thomas at 2to4players\n\"... it doesn\u2019t entirely feel like any game that\u2019s on the market, or at least none that I\u2019ve played, which is very good! The strategy game market is going to have a strong contender with this game!\" - Airk Doehlman\n\"It\u2019s a game with depth not that of chess perhaps, but in the realm of Camelot and International Checkers, both classics, so mark this one worth grabbing, and just maybe you will discover something special.\" - Calvin at First Comic News\nGuards\nArchers\nSovrano Deluxe includes storage drawers on both sides of the game board. Each drawer is large enough to hold all of the game pieces as well as the point counters.  Sovrano Deluxe also features designs cut into each side; the game stands 4 inches high and will be made with oak.\nSovrano is the premiere game of Cambium Games.  Sovrano is handmade with 100% wooden components (the point counters and rule book being the exception, of course) and we hope to be able to continue producing original games that are produced the same way.\nThe game was designed and developed by myself - Nick Chira - while all of the woodworking is completed by my father, James.  However, we are both involved with all aspects of final production (sanding, finishing, quality assurance, etc).\nWe plan to produce the game board with cabinet-grade birch, oak, and walnut plywood.  This keeps production costs and the final cost of the game lower for our fellow gamers!  It also means there will be considerably less worry about a board warping.  No one wants to have a game arrive to their house warped or find that - two days after arrival - it doesn't sit very flat on their table.  This also means that customers will be able to choose between wood and the final color of their game board. The pieces will be made of hardwood lumber, matching your board. Each game will be unique, as all wood and grain are slightly different.\nWe need funds in order to produce Sovrano and spread the word about its existence.  Cambium Games is meant to be a father-son business and Sovrano is to be hand-made, not mass-produced.  This means we need funds for materials (wood, stain, finish), as well as funds for tooling.\nIt should be noted that the images are of the prototype boards and while the designs are final, some small tweaks may still be necessary.  This would mostly effect sizing of certain aspects of the game and pieces, but nothing noticeable.  For example, the shield on the guard piece may need to come down 1/16th of an inch, or the emblems on the pieces may have to be put on one side rather than both.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSovrano is the first project that we are undertaking as Cambium Games and the only project that we are currently working on. Being that Sovrano is hand-made and made entirely of wood, there is room for error. Tooling could break, a computer could crash, pieces or the board may not cut properly, etc.\n\nFortunately, James (the woodworking end of Cambium Games) has over 30 years of experience in woodworking. He knows the ins and outs of the tooling, how to fix things, and above all he is the hardest working man I will ever know. And as most of the challenges would likely present themselves in the production of Sovrano - there is no better person to have in his position.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Cambium Games\n2 created \u00b7 12 backed\nI have always been an avid gamer and like many people, I have had ideas for many games over the years.

The Evolution base game is so vivid and true-to-life that it was recently featured in the world's leading scientific journal, Nature.\nIn Evolution: Climate, players adapt their species in a dynamic ecosystem where food is scarce, predators lurk, and the climate can swing between scorching hot and icy cold. Traits like a Hard Shell and Horns can protect your species from Carnivores while a Long Neck will help them get food that others cannot reach. Heavy Fur and Migratory can protect your species from the cold while being Nocturnal or Burrowing will provide protection from the cruel desert sun. With over 200,000 ways to evolve your species, every game evolves into a different adventure.\nIf you don't own Evolution, then buy the stand-alone Evolution: CLIMATE ($55 pledge level). It contains everything you need to play Evolution: CLIMATE.  \nIf you already own Evolution, then buy the Evolution: CLIMATE conversion kit ($25 pledge level).  It contains everything you need to transform the base game into Evolution: CLIMATE.\nBelow are links to 3rd-party reviews of Climate prototypes. Some details may be different in the final game. \nGeekDad: \"I can\u2019t say enough how impressed I\u2019ve been with the Evolution game series, and I highly recommend taking a look at Climate.\" Full Review\nSpaceBiff: \"Not only are you competing with other species, but against the land itself. There are new methods for survival, a fresh crop of ways to die, and even more reasons to play it over and over, observing as different combinations of interdependent species, fearsome carnivores, and the climate itself conspire to prevent you from thriving. This is Evolution at its toughest and most rewarding.\" Full Review\nFatherGeek: \"The Climate track introduces a lot more strategy and tactics. I have to think more about what I will add to the Watering Hole, what Trait cards to use, and what situations I need to prepare for.\" Full Review\nClimate features original watercolors by world-renowned nature artist Catherine Hamilton. Catherine taught as a professor at Rhode Island School of Design between 1997 and 2003. She was featured in the 2012 HBO documentary \"Birders: the Central Park Effect\" and has developed a body of work that crosses the boundaries between artistic and scientific investigation.\nNocturnal Critters!\nEpic Volcanoes!\nGiant Beasts!\nDefensive Horns!\nScorching Deserts!\nTerrifying Carnivores!\nFAT TISSUE!!!\nRaging Wildfires!\nWe'll post more art from the game as the campaign progresses. Catherine Hamilton is hard at work at this very moment creating wonderfully beautiful watercolors to help bring this game to life. What's this? It's the middle of the night you say? It doesn't matter! Catherine Hamilton does not sleep.\nEvolution: CLIMATE stand-alone comes with everything you need to play the game. It comes with 48 new CLIMATE trait cards and a modified version of the 129 trait cards from the Evolution base set.  \nTechnical Note for those who care: It is possible (although a little cluncky) to play the Evolution base game using the components from the Climate stand-alone.  Read Update #4 for details.\nThe Evolution: CLIMATE conversion kit comes with everything you need to convert your base set of Evolution into Evolution: CLIMATE.  \n1) Remove Ambush, Burrowing, Defensive Herding, and Carnivore from the trait cards in your base set of Evolution.  \n2) Shuffle the 86 cards from the conversion kit into the remaining base set cards.\n3) Use the Climate Track instead of the Watering Hole. \n This video shows how to play the base game of Evolution: \nEvolution: CLIMATE builds upon the rules of the Evolution base set. The centerpiece of Evolution: CLIMATE is the Climate Track, a 21\" x 9\" Watering Hole that keeps track of the climate and features a dramatic watercolor vista by Catherine Hamilton. Here's a prototype of the Climate Track made from her rough draft concept sketch:\nCLIMATE TRACK PROTOTYPE - Not final art!\nThe climate moves between scorching hot where large animals die from the heat and icy cold where small animals die from the cold. This system is intended to mirror the actual effects of ambient temperature on animals.  Here is a link to the \"surface area-volume ratio effect\" science that is being modeled. Food is abundant when the climate is warm and scarce when it is scorching hot or freezing.\nEvery new trait introduced in CLIMATE helps prevent population loss from the heat or the cold. Species will need these new traits to adapt to extreme climate conditions. In the base set Evolution, species had to adapt to food scarcity and predators. Now there is an additional threat to survival: Mother Nature!   \nAdapting to a Changing Ecosystem!\nThe heart of the Evolution game system is adapting to a continually changing ecosystem. There is no best strategy or best card combination in Evolution: Climate.  \nVideo Overview\nThe  only video overview we have of Climate was done by a German. This will help you understand the new additions that Climate brings to the base Evolution game.\n  Stretch goals marked Kickstarter Exclusive below will be available in limited quantities at northstargames.com after the campaign is over and rewards have shipped. \nAmong them, you'll see Oversized Scenario Cards. These are 70x120mm cards, illustrated by the fabulous artist Anna Kryczkowska, each of which changes a fundamental aspect of the game.\nTo use them, players pick a scenario card before the game begins and the rule described on it will apply through the entire game. Example: the Cretaceous Period card specifies each species can have an unlimited number of traits. \nFor all levels that involve shipment of physical games, backers are limited to 3 total copies per pledge (all copies should be the same game; no mixing pledge levels).

We have top notch employees and customer service.\n\nThis is our third Kickstarter campaign associated with the Evolution product line, and by now we have a clear idea of the pain points for a campaign of this type.\n\nFor example, one mistake we made in the last campaign was to use several distributors to ship to different regions around the world. This made fulfillment complicated and made it hard for us to monitor shipments. As a result too many boxes arrived to backers damaged, or failed to arrive at all. \n\nNow, instead, we're using a single fulfillment house which specializes in shipping rewards worldwide, one recommended by Jamie Stegmaier, whose campaigns are the gold standard in this area. This allows us to get games to you more reliably and more cheaply, and that backers automatically get tracking numbers. \n\nAs ever, unforeseen manufacturing problems can arise. The chances are low because the components for the expansion will be made by the same manufacturer that makes the base game, the Evolution: Flight expansion, and with whom we have a productive relationship. If a manufacturing problem should arise, we have lots of experience working through manufacturing issues, and can bring it to bear.\n\nFinally, whatever problems may arise, we will continue our policy of replacing any components with which our backers aren't satisfied.

Set against the backdrop of an alternate 1989 Miami, the game follows a mysterious masked anti-hero, known only as Jacket, as he embarks on a murderous rampage at the behest of the voices on his answering machine.\n\nRelentless in its brutal, sensory assault, the soundtrack fuses together a multitude of electronic artists to create a brooding ode to the dark, rain-slicked streets of pulp 80s cinema. Already considered a modern classic, a vinyl release of the soundtrack has been clamoured for by fans since the very beginning, so we\u2019re here to give it to you.\nThis special first pressing collector\u2019s edition of the Hotline Miami soundtrack on vinyl is limited to 5,000 copies, exclusive to backers.

We've spent the last few months working with Dennaton and the many artists featured to create something the fans can love, but we need your help to let us know this is something the community wants, and to help fund the production on a larger scale.\nWe turned to Kickstarter to gauge interest and build support from Hotline Miami fans.

The only difference is that instead of buying hundreds of dollars of models and spending months painting and assembling, the game is played with hand drawn cartoon styled paper models that come out of your printer.  Where a single unit of troops for a plastic or metal model based wargame would take an hour or more to construct, and several hours to paint, an entire cardstock warriors army can be printed and assembled in a fraction of the time for much less cost.\nTwo Armies At War\n (terrain in the image above is not included and belongs to World Works Games)\nIn Cardstock Warriors, each unit (or base) of troops has a point value, as well as a set of statistics governing how fast, defensible, potent it is in combat, and how cool they are under pressure.  Most units also feature powerful special rules, some usable every turn and some so potent they can only be used once or twice a game.  In addition, each army has special cards representing powerful spells and magic items.  Two or more players select models from their collection up to an agreed upon point value, as well their starting army card abilities and a point value of extras - and then hit the kitchen table for a knock down drag out battle.  Games are played with Cardstock Warriors models, 6 sided dice, and a ruler or tape measure.\nKeep your eyes glued here on this page for a how to play and how to construct video as the Kickstarter campaign continues.\nCheck out our how to play videos and features on the armies below!\nWitch Army Rules Overview\n Birdmen Army Rules Overview\nDwarf Army Rules Overview\n Goblin Army Rules Overview\nWhat Are We Kickstarting?\nThe game rules (which will be available for free on the website), and all four starter armies are complete.  The only thing I don't have is a way to get them to you!  The Cardstock Warriors Kickstarter is all about building a website distribution platform to get these models out and into your hands.  \nI'm a Web Developer by trade.  Instead of building websites for other people, I'd like to build one for us.  Money from the Kickstarter will be used to pay my partners (and my family) to turn away other Web Development contracts, and spend our time building out this site.  We want to build an E-Shop site to sell the models, a forum for discussion about the game, and with enough money and some time - a league and campaign system.\nThe Cardstock Warriors website will be a place to get new models, appreciate other peoples builds, and get involved in the wargaming hobby in general.\nAlright Enough of That - Show Me These Armies!\nI hear you.  Part of what makes Wargaming great is the look of two well painted armies on the table.  I think you will see below that just because something is made out of paper, doesn't mean it doesn't look beautiful on the table.  Lets looks at the starter armies below:\nBirdmen:\nBirdmen Army\nThe Birdmen army is an extremely mobile force.  Born without wings until they come of age, a typical Birdman is quick on his feet and easy to wound.  Those that survive battle long enough to gain their wings do so through positioning, speed, and ranged support.\nBirmen Ground Forces\nPictured above are some Birdmen ground forces.  Halberdiers, archer units, and flying assassin units are some of the tools at your disposal as a Birdmen general.\nBirdmen In Battle\nSee above as the fearsome Hawk Cavalry ride their giant bird breatheren into battle against the Witch Kingdoms.  Bird Shamans support by helping get their troops in just the right position to devastate their enemies.\nWitch Kingdoms:\nWitch Army\nThe Witch Kingdoms are comprised of all things that go bump in the night.  Centered around zones of 'Dark Magic' the Witch Kingdom troops typically receive buffs when near a Witch or other caster.  With regenerating troops they can be tough to stop if you don't take out their leaders.\nWitch\nThe witch is the central figure in the Witch Kingdoms army.  Featuring her familiar, a cauldron, and some pumpkins as wound tokens - the witch is the engine that drives this army.  Pictured behind is a horde of zombies.  While slow and easy to kill - zombie ranks are easily bolstered during battle with their slain enemies.\nDeath Host\nLead by a grim reaper, consuming his prisoner souls to fuel his power, this host is deadly and hard to banish.  On occasion their slain enemies are shackled to the host strengthening their numbers.\nSkeletons\nA mainstay of the witch armies, skeletons are what is left when a zombie survives enough battles.  Faster and hardier than their fresh compatriots, these are a must in any witch kingdom army.\nBats\nGiant bats, tamed by the witches, are instrumental in rooting out and eliminating small threats to the witch army.\nMounted Skeleton Kings\nSkeleton Kings\n Finally we have the mighty skeleton kings, both mounted and on foot.  The heaviest armored troops at the Witch's disposal, these make up the honor guard of the Witchs.\nVampire\nNo ghoulish army would be complete without a classic Vampire.  With base decoration present for wound counters, the vampire looks great on the field.  Choosing a different vampire power every round, even alone he can turn the tide.\nDwarves:\nDwarf Army\nAlways a staple fantasy race, the Dwarves in Cardstock warriors are a hearty group with plenty of infantry, staying power, and warmachines.  Lets take a look:\nDwarf Warriors\nDwarf warriors form the backbone of the Dwarven armies.\nDwarf Crossbows\n Crossbow teams assist from afar with heavy hitting ranged weapons.\nVeterans\n With experience comes the ability to ignore enemy numbers once per game.\nArmored Dwarves\n What is worse than a dwarf?  A dwarf in armor of course.\nDwarven Mech\n Of course if Armor isn't bad enough you could always throw in a mechanized suit.  Sporting a once per game cannon shot arm and an explosive engine, this guy always makes an impact on a game.\nDrill Team\n Sometime you need to be behind the enemy.  These little teams give you just such an opportunity.\nGatlin' Gun\n Need to shred some enemy infantry?  This model has your back.\nDwarf Cannon\n No army is complete without a Dwarf Cannon.\nMega Spear\n Sometimes instead of cannonballs you need to throw giant spears.  We have you covered here too.\nFinally due to a backer suggestion - we've got a prototype model for a Dwarven Airship!  This model isn't 100% complete yet, and the rules are still being worked on, but this is a great example of the kinds of expansions in store for Cardstock Warriors.  \n The Goblin Horde\nGoblin Horde\n The goblin horde relies on large numbers of goblins, supported by fast moving warg cavalry and chariots, as well as some crazy bombers and other primitive artillery.  They also have some of their larger cousins, the trolls, making up the fighting center of their army.\nGoblin Chariot\n One of my favorite models I've drawn, this chariot looks great on the tabletop while it crashes into it's enemies.\nGoblin Warriors\n Covered in goblin steel, these little guys are harder to move than they look.  Cheap and in numbers, they can drag down any foe.\nTrolls\n Accompanied by their handlers, these trolls will follow them into any danger.  Using whatever they can get their hands on for weapons (even goblins sometimes), these guys can really dish it out.\nGoblin Archers\n These little robin hoods have crude short bows, used to pepper the enemy.  Extremely cheap, these guys are also really good at getting in the way of enemy fire lanes, and generally causing a headache for the enemy army.\nGoblin Bombers\n Stealing dynamite from the dwarves, these crazy goblins like to run around the middle of a battle throwing dynamite into enemy troops.  Lacking any other kind of weapon, as a last resort they can detonate themselves to finish off heavy targets.\nGoblin Spears\n More lightly armored than the warrior counterparts, these guys can pump our more steely tips per square inch than any other goblin unit.  \nWarg Cavalry\n Experts at the hit and run, these fighters zip into the enemy, do their damage, and zip out of danger just as fast.  While not that great at killing entire units alone, they are best used to harry the flanks of the enemy and take out unprotected war machines.\nCatapult\n Finally, the Catapult is used at range to soften up a goblin's enemy before the troops engage.  Of course their aim isn't all that great so sometimes you have to break some eggs, y'know.\nHow do I build these?\nWe've added a how to build video - if you are interested in how the models are constructed - check us out below!\nStretch Goals\nFinally - no campaign would be complete without stretch goals.  I've got dreams for how cool this game could be, and I hope we can reach them together.\n$5000 - This is our funding goal, and includes all the troops here up on a basic featured e-shop with a forum for discussion.\n$6500 - Cards for each troop.  Right now the game rules and unit rules are all included in document form, but I'd like to build design some cards that can be printed to help players track their units stats on the table.\n$7500 - League system on the website.  Here I'd really like to expand the Cardstock warriors website to include a league system to facilitate play groups both finding each other, as well as tracking their league stats.\n$8000 - New units for each army.  I've got some great ideas for new units for these armies.  With this much capital I can pay for more of the development to lie on my partners and concentrate on building some new troops - like elephant riding goblins, more crazy dwarf contraptions, or foul ghouls and frankenstein monsters.\n$10,000 - At this point the support will have overwhelmed me.  I will produce a whole new army for launch, and I've got some really interesting forces planned (although I'd love to hear from the community).  We need some elves, or perhaps an automaton clockwork army?  The forces of Atlantis?  Maybe even something way out there like an army of slimes with troops that combine to form other troops.  When model cost isn't an issue, some really interesting game mechanics can present themselves.\n$12,000 - If we make it this far I'd really like to create a campaign system as part of the website.  This would be a metagame that allowed for territory control, scouting, random events, and resource management.  Battles would be played on the tabletop, but the rest would be managed by our campaign system.  As a developer, I would super excited to build this, but I would need to bring in some game developer experience and help.\nConclusion\nThank you so much for looking at my game.  I hope the possibility of large papercraft armies is as exciting to you as it is to me.  Let's make something awesome together!  Thanks for your support.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSince most of the art assets are in place already, the main challenge with my project will depend on the quantity of backers who select the pre-cut reward offering.

I am a professional Web Developer with my own company that has built websites for international companies, and I work day to day as an Enterprise web developer for a multi-state corporation. I intend to use the funds to pay out the contract with the rest of my partners from my web development company to produce the website.

We want as many people as possible to get hands-on experience with Overload. We are proud of this project and feel the teaser shows the potential of where Overload will go with the right support.\nWe're also hoping you'll help spread the word about Overload and the demo by posting screenshots, GIFs,and videos (to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, & everywhere else) and using the hashtag #playoverload and our Twitter handle @PlayOverload.\nAfter you play the teaser, let us know what feedback you have. You can email us at feedback@revivalprod.com or join the discussion on Forums.\nVR SUPPORT AND BUILD!\nWe just announced full VR support for Overload, plus there's a playable build for Oculus Rift!  Check out Update #20 for more details.\nWHAT PLAYERS ARE SAYING ABOUT OVERLOAD\nThe creators of Descent are proud to present the ultimate 6-degree-of-freedom shooter, OVERLOAD.  Revival Productions is continuing where Parallax left off and creating an all-new single-player game that combines the best of classic 6-DOF gameplay with modern graphics and technology.  Destroy robots, rescue hostages, blow up the reactor, and escape before the whole thing explodes.\nMULTIPLAYER EXPANSION!\nDue to overwhelming demand, we are now committing (if the Kickstarter makes it) to creating a MULTIPLAYER EXPANSION for Overload. We always wanted to have multiplayer and believed we would eventually, but we did not feel comfortable making a public commitment to it. It's too easy for something like multiplayer to blow up the schedule and adversely affect the single player game. We want to hit our single player date with a great game.\nSo, here's our plan: We will deliver the single player game in March, 2017. If the Kickstarter campaign is successful, we will deliver multiplayer as an expansion sometime after that (likely 6-8 months). Everyone who backs the campaign at the DIGITAL EDITION reward level and above will receive a free copy of the multiplayer expansion. We are not sure on the scope, but it will include the competitive modes and key features that kept Descent going for over 20 years.\nFREE COPY OF INFERNO 2 FOR BACKERS!\nAll backers at the DIGITAL EDITION reward level and above will receive a free copy of Inferno 2 from Radiangames on PC (Steam or direct download).  Inferno 2 (gameplay trailer) is an atmospheric twin-stick adventure-shooter from Luke Schneider, Lead Designer on Overload. \nBonus Trivia: Inferno was also once the name of the game now known as Descent.\nGAMEPLAY TRAILERS\nIn 1993, we founded Parallax Software to build our dream game, Descent. It was the first 3D game that allowed you to move, turn, and fire in any direction. The mind-blowing--and sometimes nausea-inducing--gameplay was matched by the technology behind it, which pushed the limits of what was possible in rendering, AI, and multiplayer. It was a milestone game that sold millions of copies and spawned two sequels.\nBecause of our desire to be close to family, Parallax Software eventually split to form Outrage (Matt Toschlog) and Volition (Mike Kulas). Outrage and Volition remained sister companies and shared in each other\u2019s knowledge and expertise. We\u2019ve remained close friends, but have always wanted to find a way to work together on a project again. The one project that we both really wanted to work on, that we couldn\u2019t not make, was an all-new six-degree-of-freedom shooter.\nIn 2014, after years of talking about it, we began working on Overload. The core objective with the game is to take elements of classic 6-DOF shooters and use modern technology to push Overload to a whole new level. We\u2019re thrilled with the progress we\u2019ve made so far, but there is still a lot left to do, and that\u2019s where Kickstarter comes in. We need your help to ensure Overload will be the ultimate six-degree-of-freedom shooter.\nIntense single-player action in 6-degrees-of-freedom\n15 level campaign filled with explosive combat and exploration \nStory by the writer of Freespace 2\nBreath-taking graphics and spectacular sound, with a soundtrack by Dan Wentz & Allister Brimble\nMore than a dozen sinister robot types and 3 massive bosses\n12 upgradeable weapons\n5 difficulty levels let you tune the game to match your abilities\nFully customizable joystick, gamepad, mouse and keyboard controls\nReleasing on PC/Mac/Linux, PS4, and Xbox One\nMany 3D action games have four to five degrees of freedom in their motion controls. Space combat games allow 3 axes of rotation, but usually only 1 axis of movement, while first person shooters generally allow 2 axes of rotation and 2.5--if you count jump as half an axis--axes of movement. A six-degree-of-freedom shooter gives you controls for all 3 axes of rotation and all 3 axes of movement. While this creates complexity for moving and controlling the player\u2019s character, the reward is an experience unlike any other. Combat and movement are more dynamic, as you are able to interact in 3 full dimensions.\nThough 6-DOF shooters surged in popularity in the 90's, the genre has laid dormant for over a decade. Overload\u2019s early development has focused on merging modern technology with natural and intuitive 6-DOF controls, all while still providing intense robot-annihilating action. Overload has a fantastic feel to the game already, and we can\u2019t wait for everyone to experience the sensational six-degree-of-freedom combat.\nThe primary objective in classic 6-DOF shooters was simple: Find the reactor, destroy it, and escape. Carrying out your objective is where the true essence of the game lay, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focusing on with Overload. Each level will be full of gameplay reasons to move and look and shoot all around you, with secrets to discover, traps to trigger, powerups to find, and cryo-frozen hostages to rescue. Along the way you\u2019ll encounter plenty of robots to battle or flee from. There will be keys to collect, shortcuts to take, and reactors to eliminate. You\u2019ll race to the exit as the timer counts down and be thrilled when you make it out just in time.\nThough Overload's primary focus is on gameplay, it will also have a rich backstory and universe ripe for expansion. The details of the story will be revealed later, and we're happy to announce that it's being penned by the writer of FreeSpace 2.\nWhen we were figuring out how to build a full-3D world for a full 3D shooter in 1993, we decided on deformed cubes and portal-based rendering as an efficient method of creating an indoor environment. That decision was based primarily on the rendering and AI needs, along with making levels relatively easy to edit and create. But it also had a positive side effect of the levels being easier to fly through, and the level designers were able to build levels that we never imagined would be possible within those cube-based constraints.\nLevel concept art\nWith Overload, we\u2019re returning to our roots and using a deformed-cube structure again, but now we\u2019ve added a 3D geometry decal system that allows us to add more detail in a very efficient manner. On top of that, we\u2019ve created a deformation tool that takes a basic cubic structure and turns it into a beautifully constructed cave. We still have the benefits of the deformed cubes, but now they been enhanced to look amazing.\nNot only that, but we\u2019ll be able to share our custom level editing tools with the community and you won\u2019t need to use Maya or 3DS Max to build amazing levels on your own*.\n*You can still use Maya/Max to build geometry decals if you want.\nDestroying a robot is extremely satisfying in Overload. It needs to be, because you\u2019ll be destroying tons of them. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time refining the feel of the combat, the way robots move and fire, and the many ways robots take damage and explode, but we\u2019re not done yet.\nWe\u2019ve established the basic AI archetypes for robots, and every robot type will have customized AI that gives them a unique personality and combat behavior. Part of that personality comes from the sounds they make as well. When you hear the alert scream for a robot, it not only lets you know that danger is coming, but it can fill you with fear as you cringe in anticipation of getting hit. Already the sound of unexpected grinding blades makes us immediately dodge up or down if at all possible.\nThe other major element of combat is the weapons. Though we\u2019ve only done initial passes on 4 weapons, they each feel great to use and have roles that they\u2019re ideal for. We have big plans to expand the weapons system with multiple upgrade types per weapon that you\u2019ll unlock over the course of the game.\nOverload has a classic inspiration, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll look pixelated or have an 8-bit soundtrack. It uses the latest graphics technology to immerse you in the world. With physically-based rendering, dynamic shadows, and realtime global illumination, your eyes will be as engaged as your heart. Even when you can\u2019t see a robot hiding around the corner, its shadow could give it away. And when you turn the tables and blow the robot to pieces, you're rewarded with some beautifully rendered particle effects.\nOn top of the fantastic visuals, we\u2019re pulling out all the stops to make Overload sound amazing. We're excited to announce that we've enlisted the talents of Dan Wentz and Allister Brimble. Dan worked on sound and music for Descent 2, FreeSpace, and Red Faction, and has maintained an active presence in the Descent community for the past 20 years. Allister worked on the CD soundtrack for Descent along with many other hit titles over the years including Dungeon Master II, the Team 17 range of Amiga games, Rollercoaster Tycoon & Driver.\nOverload is being developed for PC/Mac/Linux, Playstation 4, and Xbox One.  Though it will look best on high-end PCs and consoles, it will still run great on a broad range of hardware. The game is being built to play well with a gamepad, joystick and keyboard, or mouse and keyboard, so regardless of the platform of controller you choose, you'll still be getting a fantastic experience.\nWe expect the console versions to launch simultaneously with the PC/Mac/Linux version, but they may be a month or two later.\n MOD TOOLS & EDITOR DOCS: We'll add support for custom robots and weapons (data and 3D models) in addition to releasing full Level Editor documentation.\nRevival Productions' team has helped create other milestone gaming franchises, including FreeSpace, Red Faction, and Saints Row. All the team members are seasoned veterans who've worked together on multiple projects and shipped dozens of products between them.\nIn addition to the primary team members above, and the two sound designer-musicians, many former Parallax alums will be contributing their expertise to ensure that Overload becomes the ultimate six-degree-of-freedom shooter.\nREWARD CLARIFICATIONS\nBecause we can't change the reward descriptions, and we added 3 new reward tiers, we want to clarify these issues even though the reward listing does not show them.\nKEYCHAIN: All tiers at $75 and above get the Overload keychain.\nSNEAK PEEK FORUM: All tiers at $200 and above get access to the Sneak Peek Forum.\nLEVEL DESIGN ALPHA: All tiers at $900 and above can choose to get the Level Design Alpha.\nREWARD ADD-ONS\nWe're also happy to offer the following digital add-on rewards to any tier at $25 or more:\nEXTRA DIGITAL COPY: Add $20 per extra copy to your pledge.  You will be able to specify the platform for each of your extra copies at a later date.  PC/Mac/Linux copies include both a Steam key and a DRM-free download (via GOG or another service to be determined).\nThese extra physical rewards are available to all tiers at $120 and above:\nEXTRA BOXED COPY: Add $30 per extra copy to your pledge. No additional shipping applies.\nEXTRA T-SHIRT: Add $35 per extra T-shirt to your pledge. No additional shipping applies.\nWe're very passionate about Overload, and have self-funded the prototype, but now we need your support to finish what we started.  The Kickstarter campaign funds will enable us to finish Overload and make it into the game we've always wanted to make.\nWe also want to get the community involved in the game, and Kickstarter is a great way to engage those who are as passionate about the game as we are.  At Parallax Software, we were heavily involved with and influenced by the community, and we want to get to know and interact with the players again.  Your passion and feedback on Overload will help make it the best it can be.\nDescent to Overload on Imgur\nDescent to Overload Visual History on Imgur", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDeveloping videos games is an uncertain and risky endeavor. For starters, development schedules are notoriously hard to forecast. Perhaps the primary reason for this is that the key attribute desired of the finished product \u2013 fun \u2013 is so subjective and hard to pin down that games often require extensive revision as original ideas prove ineffective and new solutions must be found. And since games often strive to innovate (in terms of gameplay, visuals, audio, and so on) it\u2019s often the case that there are not established workflows for creating content, leading to further risk.\n\nFor the following reasons, we believe we can manage the risk and deliver a solid game mostly on schedule and with the funds provided by a successful Kickstarter campaign.\n\n1. We are working in a genre that we understand \u2013 one that, in fact, we created. We have a deep understanding of what Overload will be, what it should look like, and what will make it fun.\n\n2. We have a team with incredible experience. Our project leaders, Mike Kulas and Matt Toschlog, have each been developing games for 30 years or more, and other key members of the team also have deep professional backgrounds. We have a long history of making games together.\n\n3. We\u2019re already pretty far along in the development of Overload, as you can see from the game footage included in our video. The look and feel of the game is already established, and most major systems and tools are already implemented. \n\n4. The additional funding we seek now will largely be used for relatively lower-risk development such as game balancing and creating the content (enemies, weapons, and levels) needed for the full game.\n\nThe only significant risk is that the game will not launch by the intended date. We intend to make Overload the best game in its genre, and that could mean a slight delay to ensure its quality meets our standards.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #47", "update_userinfo": "March 2019 Update", "update_content": "Hello Overload backers!\nFor some time, we've wanted to provide an update on Revival and Overload.

We thought of the Massachusetts State House in Boston as part of the freedom trail (looking great with its golden dome), the Willis Tower in Chicago or the Empire State Building in NY, the Flatiron Building in NY, the Lincoln Memorial, the White House and of course the Statue of Liberty. But this is not final and we are open to suggestions. If you have any, please let us know in the comments of the respective update!\nChange colors in a building or add your own white or grey pillars with the new white and grey stretch goal stones!\n    In World Monuments players set out to build iconic monuments from all over the world. They work together constructing the monument with materials they gathered in the quarry beforehand. But who will earn the most points while building and therefore become the famous master builder?\nWorld Monuments is very interactive game for 2-4 players, ages 8 and up and plays in about 45 minutes.\nMonument plans in the basic game\nFirst, the players choose one monument they want to build. Choices are the Capitol, Notre Dame, San Pietro and the Taj Mahal. The lower right of the building plan shows how many stones of each color are needed to complete the monument. There are four different colored building stones to construct a monument - purple, red, white and yellow.\nMonument building plans\nThe game is played in 3 rounds. Every round has 2 phases. During the first phase, the players gather stones in the quarry, which they need to construct the monument in the second phase. The variety of stones available in the quarry changes each round. At the beginning of the first phase the grab bag is filled. The amount of stones for the current round is shown on the building plan. They are placed in the bag along with 1 black and 3 blue stones.\nGrab bag content in each round\nThe black stone determines the starting player for the next round and earns you 3 victory points (VP) at the end of the round. The blue stones give you VP at the end of the game, the amount of points depends on the number of blue stones you collected during the game.\nVictory points earned with the black or blue stones\nAll stones in the bag are then placed on the quarry, one per space in the outer ring, 2 per space in the middle ring and the rest of the stones directly in the middle. The starting player now places the large pawn anywhere on the outer circle of the quarry, taking the respective stone. The second player moves the pawn two steps, the third player three steps and from then on, every player moves the pawn four steps. The pawn may be moved on every adjacent field, but the movement has to end on the outer circle. The active player has to pick up a stone on every field the pawn steps on and places it behind his screen. When the players collected all stones \u2013 you have to pick up a minimum of 1 stone each turn \u2013 the first phase ends.\nFilled Quarry for Taj Mahal monument\nPhase two, the building phase, begins with the player who had gathered the black stone from the quarry. This player places a building stone onto the board. Then the next player places a building stone and so on. Directly after placing a stone, the players receive the corresponding points on the scoring track. A stone on the first level earns you 1 point. A stone on the top most level earns you 9 points. Everyone would love to wait for the higher points, but if you have a building stone that can be placed, you have to place it, even if this means your opponent can score higher points on his turn. When a player can no longer place a building stone because he is out of stones or there is no legal placement possible for his stones, the player passes. Once a player passes he or she is not allowed to place any more stones this round. If the player has stones left, that player looses victory points \u2013 1 VP per building stone. All stones are kept for the next building phase or for the end scoring (blue stones). Only the black stone is put in the bag for the next round. Once everybody has passed, the next round begins by filling up the grab bag with new stones.\nLevel dependent scoring per built stone\nThe game ends after the third round. Victory points for blue stones are added on the scoring track and the highest score wins!\nAbout 400 years ago, merchants from many different countries organized themselves into companies, making it easier for them to send larger fleets of ships to the Far East. They hoped for huge profits from these voyages. In Batavia you are one of these merchants.\nWin the auction of ship cards and you also win start player for the round. Lay down as many ship cards as you can for the trading post you want to travel to, in an effort to win the majority seal. Winning the majority seal allows you to move to that trading post. Pick up the commodity by taking the trading post title off the game board. Trade in trading posts for gold. Mark the commodity with one of your crates. Points will be given at the end of the game to the player or players with the most crates in each of these commodities. During the game, pirates threat to attack! As players lay down ship cards for the various countries, move the ship cubes for those countries up the ship cube cannon track. The cannon moves up this very same track for every ship card that is played. Once the cannon reaches 25 in a 4 - 5 player game, the country with the most ship cards laid down are blown up, meaning they are removed from the game and ship cubes and cannon are reset accordingly. When a player plays ship cards and can no longer find the matching trading post on the board, the game comes to an end with all players having one last chance to get to a trading post. Batavia can be played by 3 - 5 players ages 10 and up, in 60 minutes. Travel to the most lucrative trading posts in the Far East. Collect the most commodities to win. In Batavia!\nBatavia will be delivered in the German version with language independent material and English rules!\nCheck out Batavia at BGG:\nhttps://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/35248/batavia\nIn the bustling market of Cairo, carpets, oil and spices are sold. But only a big market stall promises big profit and big points.\nAt the beginning of the game every player places 3 market stalls with his symbol on the board. Each player owns market stalls 6 different colors - 1 stall each. During his turn, a player has 3 different action possibilities. A player can move a customer, build or expand a market stall or draw 2 cards (needed for building). If a player moves one of the 6 customers to one of his stalls of the same color, he earns money. The bigger the stall, the more money the player gets. But competition is high and the players might need a market crier to entice customers to their stalls farther away. With the earned money, players can expand their stalls, giving them victory points. Extra victory points can be scored by building the biggest stall of a color. Instead of expanding one of their market stalls, players can also place new stalls, but they have to follow different restrictions. Placing a new stall gets more difficult the more stalls there are on the market place board.\nKairo can be played by 2-4 players ages 8 and up, in 45 minutes.\nCheck out Kairo at BGG:\nhttps://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/107635/kairo\nTake on the role of a Roman merchant sailing the Mediterranean. For three rounds, with three different phases, navigate the sea and coast to deliver on contracts you have acquired (in phase 1: Acquire Contracts). But there is a catch (so to speak). You get to determine the order of your contracts, but they must be filled in that order. So as you are acquiring and placing contracts on your boat, you must take into account where you are traveling. When you fulfill a contract (in phase 2: Fulfill Contracts), you receive either favor at the temple or gold, which can be used to buy favor but also may be used to extend your ship's range. Thus, gold can help you bridge that key leg of the journey so that you can deliver that contract in a timely fashion and be well positioned for the next part of your journey. By laying out your contracts efficiently and navigating the sea and coastline effectively, you will earn the most favor (in phase 3: Scoring) from the temples and win the game.\nNeptun is a game for 3 to 5 players ages 8 and up and plays in 45 minutes.\nCheck out Neptun at BGG:\nhttps://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/164237/neptun\nIn Lost Legends players are mighty warriors, developing their strengths in order to battle increasingly ferocious monsters as they quest deeper into danger. Each warrior is unique, and starts with varying vital levels and hero points. Along the journey, they will earn different weapons and equipment as well as experience, new skills, legend points and kill trophies.\nEach round of play has its own deck of monsters. The first monster each warrior encounters is placed in front of them, and then an additional monster is revealed in the center of the table. Players then draft weapons, armor, spells, special abilities, charms, potions and healing items with an eye toward defeating their assigned monster. Each player is dealt 6 equipment cards. They choose one, and either add it to their inventory by paying its cost in hero points (costs can be reduced by skills), or turn it into additional skill for free. This continues, after passing the cards, until each player has one card left, which is removed from the game. \nNow the players attack. They determine the effectiveness and ferocity of the attack and mete out damage. If this isn\u2019t enough to take out the monster, the monster will counter attack. If you do not have enough protection to defend yourself you will get wounded or worse, you could be knocked out for the rest of the round and will not fight again until the next round. When you defeat a monster, you might be able to claim a trophy award or two. These vary in kill trophies required and legend points awarded.\nThe round ends when all the monsters have been defeated, or all the players have been knocked out. At this point, all players refresh back to their full levels of mana and health, trophy points are awarded for the round, and you move on to the next round, where you will be able to draft stronger, better equipment. And you\u2019ll need it, because the monsters get stronger, too!\nGame ends after the 3rd round and only the warrior with the most legend points becomes the most legendary!\nLost legends is a game for 3 to 5 players, ages 10 and up and plays in 70 minutes.\nCheck out Lost Legends at BGG:\nhttps://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/131891/lost-legends\nChange colors in a building or add your own white or gray pillars with the new white and grey stretch goal stones!\nThe temple of Kukulcan or El Castillo in Chichen Itza (Mexico) might look like this:\nSHIPPING\nBrazil and Russia\nDue to the high customs charges and delivery challenges we no longer ship to Brazil or Russia.

Two more people, the illustrator and graphic designer accompanied us during the developing process of the game and campaign.\nWe are Simon (game designer), Bastian (game development, online version), Kaspar (game development, 3D renderings) and Daniel of Board Game Circus (campaign development, marketing).\nThe official website of Heldentaufe is www.heldentaufe.ch\nOur illustrator is Mathieu Leyssenne, whom some of you might know from wonderful board games such as Jamaica, The Hare & the Tortoise and many more. It is his beautiful artwork that brings the story of Heldentaufe to life. See more of his art at www.aniii.com\nThe graphic design of the campaign page was done by L\u00e9onard Crettaz.

We will update and extend the FAQ during the campaign.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis campaign is a reboot. The first campaign has been halted because of a risky calculation and missing shipping partners. A lot has been improved since the first attempt: For this second attempt to fund Heldentaufe we have made a proper calculation, partnered with experienced shipping companies and teamed up with a new member (Daniel) to support us in marketing and promotion.\n\nPublishing a board game is a complicated process which is prone to many mistakes. During the past month we have worked hard to prepare this campaign and the manufacturing of the product. The rules are final and translated, the illustrations for the game as you see it are all done, the layout for printing cards and components is done and the production quote from our manufacturer is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\nIf we reach the stretch goal for illustrated mission cards our illustrator Mathieu Leyssenne will need some extra time to work on these. The same applies to the Spanish rule book which has to be translated if we reach the stretch goal. Finally all rule books are undergoing professional layout after the campaign. More stretch goals will eventually delay production.\n\nPre-Production and production usually takes a while and unforeseen events may occur. Such as color corrections that have to be done or sending print-proofs and material samples back and forth until everything is exactly the way we want it. We are definitely not going to rush out the game, we want everything to be perfect before we start production. If anything of this happens it might delay production.\n\nDelivering goods around the globe is no easy task but we have shipping companies with an expertise in board game deliveries. Once these companies have the manufactured products in their warehouse they will start shipping these rewards to you. In the past we have seen deliveries being delayed due to harbour strikes, plane strikes, warehouse strikes or troubles with customs at the border. Several holidays might as well delay delivery. If anything of this happens the project might run late.\n\nWhatever happens, positive or negative, we will share it with you. As avid backers and lovers of the Kickstarter community we are 100% dedicated to open backer communication. We will involve you as much as possible and be transparent with our process. During the project we will be present answering any questions and reading all comments. During the campaign and production process we will update you regularly to make sure you always know where we are at.\n\nP.

With vibrant colours, rich Gothic illumination, and lustrous foil-stamped playing spaces, Kerak is game you\u2019ll love owning as much as playing.\nYou get two sets of painted/silkscreened, wooden Kerak pieces. Each piece is 1.31\u2019 in diameter, and vary in height depending upon the piece\u2019s strength.\nYou\u2019ll also get two, beautifully embroidered, faux velvet drawstring pouches to keep your pieces in: the red pouch is embroidered with a copper lion, the blue, a silver unicorn. You'll also get the rules, and two cheat-sheets!\n***All pictures are of our prototype, which was hand-made.  The machined version will be more crisp and detailed ***\nDownload your free Print & Play to test it out yourself!\nStrategy Redefined\nWe love strategy games, but they've got a big problem: they get boring. For example, every game of Chess starts with the same old pieces in the same old places, and unless you're a Chess master, this gets really repetitive, really fast.\nTo fix this, we usually add chance into the mix, by adding dice, or randomizing starting locations. This makes it fun, because every game is different. The only problem is that \"fun\" comes at the cost of \"fair\": adding chaos into the mix means that the game can never be truly fair, or strategic. Why can't we have both?\nWe can, it's Kerak.\nKerak\u2019s shining board is made by stamping metallic foil (gold, silver, or copper coloured) onto the cardboard, just like a hardcover book. Not only does it look great, but it\u2019s made to last!\nKerak solves problem one, without causing problem two.\nPlayers start the game by placing their pieces on the board, one at a time, in any configuration they like.  Also, the odd number of certain pieces, and the board's unique hexagonal shape, ensures that every game will be asymmetrical: you can't just \"mirror\" your opponent.  In a nutshell, every game is different.\nAlso, there's no randomness: what you see is what you get. This means that every game of Kerak is 100% fair: it's a true, pure, thoroughbred strategy game, in the tradition of Chess or Stratego.\nKerak also has unmatched strategic depth. In most games, pieces act as individuals. In Chess, a pawn can capture a knight, even if the knight has a rook right next door.  In Kerak, pieces support one another (two knights are better than one), and can be used individually, or in groups.  By doing this, Kerak opens up whole new strategic dimension to play with!\nKerak is unlike any other strategy game. We love playing it, and we know you will too.\nPronounced Kur-ack, our game is named after one of the most impressive Medieval castles, which is located in modern Jordan.\nOur Story\nAs kids, my little brother (Dylan) and I (Spencer) played every day; it was basically our full time job, and we took it seriously. We started out small, using our imaginations to make our toys, household objects, anything, come alive\u2014we once created a whole world where erasers, yes erasers, were sentient beings capable of building great cities (It made sense at the time, somehow).\nAt some point we left the world of make-believe and took up arms as board game warriors; we fashioned ourselves as kings of Chess, great generals of Stratego, and the Machiavellian masters of Settlers of Catan. Still elementary kids, we were probably none of these things, but we did learn the basics of what makes a great game.\nJump forward fifteen odd years. We\u2019re now in our mid-twenties, and we're bored. Our childhood games feel stale: I\u2019ve seen the openings in Chess more times than I can count, they never change. Settlers of Catan is great, but  there\u2019s too much luck involved to make it competitive.\nThis is why I imagined Kerak: no two games are ever the same, so it never gets boring; and there\u2019s no luck at all, just strategy. I told Dylan about my idea and he was enthusiastic, so we decided to make it, and try it out.\nWe built the first ever Kerak set out of watercolour paper, markers, and shiny metallic paint. Despite the lopsided hexagons and irregular cutting, the game was fun. We loved it.\nThe first ever Kerak game was a humble affair.\nThe next step was to make it fair. Our family and friends joined in, and told us what they thought. We adjusted the rules, added a new piece, and built a new board. Now we had a real game.\nthis version was actual size, made of canvas, paint, thick paper, and those felt things you put under chairs to keep the floor from scratching...\nAt this point we had a great game and great people to play with. All that was left to do was to share it.\nhere's our latest prototype, in all its glory, we can't wait to make the real thing!\nPlaying Kerak\nthe basics\nFor starters, make sure everything\u2019s there. You should have one game-board, two faux velvet pouches, 18 blue and 18 red pieces, two cheat-sheets, and the rules. All good? Let\u2019s play Kerak!\nYour goal in Kerak is to capture the opposing castle, while protecting yours: if you do that, you win, and if neither player can capture each other\u2019s castle, it\u2019s a draw.\nBefore continuing, check your cheat-sheet, it shows you the different pieces, and their strengths and speeds.\nbuilding you army\nTo start Kerak, you and your opponent take turns placing pieces, one at a time, on the board, in the three rows nearest you. You can place your pieces in any sequence, and in any configuration. Red places first\nmoving day\nOnce the board is set, you take turns moving your pieces, red moves first. You must move one, and only one, piece per turn; only one piece can occupy a space.\nYou can move any piece in any direction, and any number of spaces up to and including the piece\u2019s movement value. For example, cavalry can move one, two, or three spaces a turn.\nPieces with multiple movement values cannot move into a space that touches a space that they\u2019ve previously left (I).\nI. Pieces cannot move into spaces adjacent to spaces they previously occupied during that move.\nPieces can only move into open spaces, or spaces resulting in a valid capture: they cannot \u201cjump\u201d friendly pieces.\nthe battle begins\nHere\u2019s how to capture pieces:\nFirst, you must be able to move your piece into a space occupied by your opponent\u2019s piece.\nSecond, your piece must be strong enough to capture your opponent\u2019s piece: if your piece\u2019s strength value, plus that of all your supporting pieces (next section), is greater or equal to your opponent\u2019s piece\u2019s strength value, plus that of their supporting pieces, then you can capture it.\nthe whole is greater\nPieces are stronger when they\u2019re together. They support each other when attacking or defending by contributing their strength value to their friendly piece. This means strong pieces can make other pieces strong too. Here\u2019s how it works:\nYour attacking piece is supported by all your pieces adjacent to the defending piece. Archers are special because they support attacks up to and including two spaces away (II & III).\nII. Red\u2019s cavalry (strength=1) attacks Blue\u2019s knight (s2), Red\u2019s infantry both support the attack (2xs1) because they are adjacent to Blue\u2019s knight; Red\u2019s knight cannot. Red wins (3s>2s).\nII. Red\u2019s cavalry (strength=1) attacks Blue\u2019s knight (s2), Red\u2019s infantry both support the attack (2xs1) because they are adjacent to Blue\u2019s knight; Red\u2019s knight cannot. Red wins (3s>2s).\nYour defending piece is supported by all your pieces adjacent to both the attacking piece and your defending piece (IV).\nIV. Blue\u2019s archer is defending an attack from Red\u2019s infantry. Because Blue\u2019s infantry is adjacent to both pieces it supports; the knight\u2019s cannot. Red cannot capture blue\u2019s archer (1s<2s).\nparting gifts\nHere are the final rules that make Kerak more fair.\nCavalry, knights, and heroes can always capture archers.\nCastles only support with a strength of 1 (they still defend at 2), and support any adjacent infantry or archers, even from behind (V).\nV. Blue\u2019s castle supports the infantry defending Red\u2019s attack because castles support all units adjacent to them, regardless of where the attacking piece is.\nOnly infantry and archers can capture castles; cavalry, knights, and heroes cannot, but can support castle captures. Make sure you take care of your weak pieces too!\nfor the win\nJust in case you need to settle a score, each piece has a point value. If both players agree (before playing), if they draw, the player who captured a higher total piece value wins.\nThe Kerak board is also lettered and numbered so that players can record their moves! Because the Kerak board is hexagonal, the notation system follows diagonal lines. When recording a move, write the letter before the number.\nCheck out these quickplay videos!

We are Artists working with different mediums, exploring our shared creative vision - Mujuworld.\nMiss Muju sculpting the Star Traveller\nWe have been making and exhibiting sculptures, paintings & prints for over 10 years.  You can see more of our work on our website here : www.mujuworld.co.uk\nOur latest project...\nThere are 10 billion galaxies in the observable universe.  \nEach time we look up into the stars the same question arises...  \nAre there other beings out there?\nThe possibilities of intergalactic travel and the concept of multidimensional reality inspire our creative vision.  It is this fascination that led us on the journey to create the Star Traveller.  \nIt began life as a drawing in a sketchbook, and from there we developed the concept and sculpted it into it's final 3D form. We then created a mould and cast the sculpture in bio-resin in our studio. The prototype sculptures were then handpainted and varnished.\nWith your support we hope to release the Muju Star Traveller to a worldwide audience.\nWhy we need your help...\nThe pre-production costs involved in releasing a new sculpture are high.\nWe choose to cast our sculptures in bio-resin, which is a non-toxic and more sustainable material than traditional resin.  However it's significantly more expensive than polyurethane resin.\nBio-resin is also a harder material to work with than standard resin, and takes much longer to set.

It features eurogame strategy and only takes about 25 minutes to play. It's only $25 for this Kickstarter, that's $5 off retail, with FREE domestic shipping. It also has extremely low language dependence, and with Ship Naked's Customs-Friendly Worldwide\u2122, you can rest assured with our $3 international shipping.\nTo succeed in Province, you need to manage a communal worker pool representing the workers in your town. Players move their workers to generate resources (Labor and Coin) that are used to build the various Structures, which in turn affect how you generate resources. But your opponent can also move the workers leaving you without the resources you need!\nWith over 10,000 copies of the original version sold, we're out of copies! Rather than just do a reprint, we have revisited every aspect of the game to make it bigger and better! The increased size ensures that the gamestate is more readable and the components are more secure and easily handled during play. This new edition is also quite portable (the board is 5.75\" x 7.75\" / 14.605cm x 19.685cm). Additionally, it features the classic game with a new alternate board for those who want a new challenge.\nThe game board features the classic version on one side, and the new version on the other side!\nThe game includes the new larger double-sided board, bigger coins, bigger structures, bigger goal tokens, the new guild contract token, wooden cubes for labor tracking, 12 wooden meeples, a custom wooden die, and a manual!\nThe new board isn't just for show. We designed the structures featured on it to create gameplay moments not possible on the original board. The new board has 6 new structures, and 2 returning structures.\nStructure costs and effects differ from the original board which makes for a new buying curve, new problems to solve, and new ways to hinder your opponent.\nStill Small - Province Deluxe may be a lot larger than the original version of the game, but the new box still only measures 6\"\u2a098\"\u2a091.25\". It's easy to fit in any bag or backpack, and doesn't take up a lot of room on the table. \nElegant Mechanics and Tough Decisions - The way you interact with Province is simple; move some workers, get some resources, and spend them. But wherever you leave the workers is where they'll be on your opponent's turn - so denying your opponent resources and planning ahead a turn or two to get the resources you need is challenging and fun. \nQuick Gameplay - Once you get the hang of the mechanics, a game of Province can go by in about 15 minutes. Reevaluate your strategies, change your buying order, focus on denying resources, switch which board you're playing with. In the time it takes to play one eurogame, you can get a few radically different games of Province in! \nA 2-Player Euro - Most eurogames struggle when played with just 2 players. Province was tightly designed for only 2 players, making for a great experience that isn't watered down or compromised.\nPeople love Province! We've been overwhelmingly flattered by all of the kind things people have had to say about this game!

You can find the updated rules through the link below. Stretch goals will allow us to include more official languages!\nClick this image to check out the pre-release version of the rules!\nYou can also check out our video from the original game.\nThere are also a lot of subtitles options for the video, so if English isn't your first language, give those a try!\nWant to give the game a try? Maybe check out the new board? During the campaign you can play the game on Tabletopia with your friends online!\nProvince Deluxe Edition has two minor gameplay tweaks - they aren't extreme, but we feel they improve the game!\nHarbor and Tavern Probabilities - In the original version of province, you cast two coins to see what the boats brought into the harbor. This meant that you were 25% likely to get labor, 25% likely to get coin, and 50% likely to hire a worker. Casting coins was necessary for shipping the game in an envelope, but the original prototypes used dice - just like Province Deluxe Edition. The new probabilities are 33.3% across the board - meaning the Harbor and Tavern will generate resources more often which in turn make them slightly more valuable. Immediate \nGoal Resolution and Reveal - The old rules for goals were that when one goal was finished, you immediately reveal the next goal. This meant that some games had a cascading effect where goals were completed one after another. In Province Deluxe Edition, the rules state that you can only reward one goal per turn, and a new goal is revealed at the beginning of the next player's turn. This means games will be less erratic, while maintaining the capacity to end from all goals being completed.\nWe're estimating a May delivery. Why so quick? We've chosen to do our manufacturing in the US for Shift, Province, Shadow of the Elder Gods, and 100 Swords. We've been very happy with the communication, quick manufacturing timelines, and constantly improving production quality, and so we're continuing in that tradition. While it can be slightly more expensive, at the end of the day you're getting high-quality, ethically produced games with crazy-fast turnaround times! No waiting on slow trans-pacific cargo ships.\nAfter successfully fulfilling both Shadow of the Elder Gods and 100 Swords, we're continuing to use Customs-Friendly Worldwide\u2122 by Ship Naked. This is the same method that Gamelyn Games used for their Tiny Epic series which has shipped thousands of copies of Tiny Epic Kingdoms and Tiny Epic Defenders to international backers without incident. This is the same method that White Wizard Games (the makers of Star Realms) is using for the Epic Card Game. As a result, you should not get hit with customs, brokerage, or import fees. Customs-Friendly Worldwide from Ship Naked is Worry-Free Shipping\u2122. Ship Naked will reimburse any recipient directly if you have any issues or costs associated with customs, brokerage, or fees from importing.

Let us now if you'd like to help!\nIn 2013 we designed, developed, and published our very first microgame with the help of backers like you! Shift is a dueling card game that boils down Japanese-style CCG's into a single card. All you need is a friend, two cards, and some coins to throw-down in an epic anime inspired battle! It was even published in Brazil by our friends at Funbox Jogos!\nIn Spring 2014, we Kickstarted the original Province, which has over 10,000 copies to date. It was also our first game to reach stores. Province tackled the challenge of making a competitive two-player micro eurogame. We think it's pretty swell. Other people seem to agree!\nIn Fall 2015, we brought our micro ameritrash game, Shadow of the Elder Gods, to Kickstarter. In it, 1-4 players work together to stop a deck of eldritch threats from bringing about the end of all things. Shadow of the Elder Gods is a big game in a small box, and it's now in stores thanks to backers like you!\nWe also successfully funded 100 Swords, our amazing two-player micro deck building game where you collect swords and defeat monsters to get the most gold!\nWith your help Province Deluxe Edition will bring Province back to market in this awesome new version!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our fifth time working with our manufacturing partner.

As a result, we are offering these add-ons only AFTER the KS program ends (via our survey that you will receive within two weeks after this KS ends) AND we are only offering them to US and Canadian Backers for certain. \nFor backers in the EU, Australia, Asia and South America, we will provide these Add-Ons on a first come, first served basis. If we do not have the stock needed, we will offer you a FULL refund. \nThere will be an additional cost for shipping (matching our costs for shipping, we do not make a profit on shipping!) and you will be advised of those extra shipping costs after you have filled out and returned the survey and worksheet. If the shipping costs prove unacceptable to you, you will not be charged anything additional for Add-ons. If the shipping charges are acceptable, you will pay for the Add-ons via PayPal or wire payment.  \nSuzanne White (suzannew@eagle-gryphon.com) & Jason Grantz (JGrantz@Eagle-Gryphon.com)\nDistribution Centers:\nUS: Orders ship from our Eagle-Gryphon Games Kentucky warehouse.\nEU: Orders ship (primarily) from Boosterbox in Enschede, NL.\nCanada: Orders ship from Board Games Bliss in Ontario.\nUK: Orders ship from BoardGameGuru in London.\nAustralia: Orders ship from The Games Capital in Canberra.\nASIA: Orders ship from our warehouse in Shenzhen, China (mainland).\nEU Note: Some EU might be shipped directly from your home country, if retailers in your country join us!

If there are issues with your game, please contact our customer service department within 30 days of receiving the copy of the game you have pledged for. We will take every step necessary to get you exactly what you pledged for. Contact: customer-service@eagle-gryphon.com. We do not accept responsibility for messages that end up in SPAM, that\u2019s out of our control.\n\nShipping issues are relatively uncommon, but they do sometimes occur, especially when shipping to destinations outside of the US. We will obtain tracking information when it is possible, but sometimes it is not. We cannot guarantee that there will not be shipping problems, as we cannot guarantee the service and reliability of the various postal/delivery services involved around the world. You will have to assume that risk along with us.\n\nWe are a games publisher and not a shipping/delivery/governmental postal carrier. We do not ship damaged games out to you, but occasionally they are damaged in shipping by the carrier. Please keep in mind that we did not cause that damage, nor are we responsible for it. Your first recourse is to recover your losses (if any) from the carrier, not us. However, if you are reasonable about it, we will work with you to document and recover these losses as well.\n\nEagle-Gryphon Games has completed over 50 Kickstarter projects to date. Virtually all of those projects have either completed delivery or they are in the midst of it right now! Five projects, successfully completed on Kickstarter within the past few months, include these 5 -- Defenders of the Realm Dragon Expansion; Morocco, the Ferti Sugoi series; Taluva Deluxe; and Attack Deluxe. All of those games are in various stages of either production or shipping to Backers.\n\nWe keep Backers notified by Updates about the status of their projects. We deliver on our promises reliably and usually on time (the very few delays we have ever had were related to production schedule issues and/or transport issues such as weather and dock strikes, which we have only, at best, partial or NO control over).\n\nTo put it simply, you will get everything you are promised when you pledge to one of our Kickstarter Projects, and it will be delivered to you in as timely a manner as possible.\n\nShipping can be problematic and expensive. We ask that you are patient and tolerant and share the burden with us of making sure that shipping is as positive an experience as it can be. But be aware of what is involved please.\n\nWe will ship US orders from our Eagle-Gryphon Games warehouse in Kentucky; Canadian orders from Board Games Bliss in Ontario; Australian orders from The Games Capital in Canberra; and Asian orders from our warehouse in Shenzhen, China (mainland). Many EU orders will ship from our warehouse in Enschede, The Netherlands and some might be shipped directly from your home country, if other print partners join us in co-productions! UK Backers will get their games from BoardGameGuru in London. We do all this in an effort to keep expenses low but this much shipping also introduces more chances for damage and delays. We cannot avoid this risk, and save money for you. So we ask that you join us in assuming some of the risk when it is not ours either, and that you are as tolerant and patient as need be about the estimates we make many months before as to \"Estimated Delivery\" dates in the Rewards section. Many things about this estimate are simply NOT within our control, and you must agree to be tolerant and accepting of those delays. We will do our best to keep things on time, but we simply cannot assure you that we will meet these \u201cmade-well-in-advance\u201d estimates.\n\nIt has been our experience that many people (including sophisticated international Kickstarter Backers) frequently confuse \"shipping\" expense and \"postage\" expense. What we try to cover with \u201cshipping fees\u201d is shipping expenses, not just postage. Postage is the actual charge your country's postal service (or UPS, FedEx, etc) charges us to deliver a package within that country.\n\nShipping is far more comprehensive and includes: getting the container shipped to the US, or the EU, or Australia; the Customs and VAT (or equivalent) and other import fees and taxes; the drayage from the port to the warehouse; the warehouse fees to unload and sort out and prepare packages; the materials and labor involved in the last item; fees to the warehouse for their service to us, and only after all of that, the postage! We need to cover all of those costs--and they really add up. Frequently they cost as much or more than the game(s) did to produce.\n\nWhen we combine a low margin price (such as the one we offer on all of our KS projects) with this shipping expense, we do not make any profit if we are not very careful. We hope that the shipping we are charging for this project is as low as we can make it and still stay in business. We ask that you understand this and when we occasionally make mistakes in quoting shipping expenses and that you accept these changes. We will always give you a refund if we must make shipping fee changes and they are not acceptable to you.\n\nWe also reserve the right to combine the shipping of any and all pledges for multiple KS projects if the projects and the shipping are run close to the same time and if we can ship them all within a reasonable time (30 days) of us receiving them in our Kentucky warehouse. Of course, we will advise you ASAP if it looks like we will be holding up shipping for this reason and you will always have the right to pay additional fees to get expedited delivery on individual orders/pledges.\n\nInternationally, for unusual shipping destinations or multiple games, get in touch with us and tell us the total how many games you want and which ones; and where you would like them shipped.\n\nTo get in touch with us, please send us a Message (not a Comment please) using the \"Contact Me\" button at the top of the KS project.\n\nWe will not ship to Russia, the Ukraine and select places in Asia and the rest of the world, except for specially-made arrangements wherein the Backer takes the risk involved in receiving the package.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #39", "update_userinfo": "Update for Italy, Spain, and Germany", "update_content": "First of all, our sincere apologies for the very long wait which you have had.

The artwork and imagination really push the game over the top and make Vasty Wilds an instant buy. I think Vasty Wilds will appeal to a wide range of gamers, from casual to hobbyist.\" - Board Game Authority\nThe components of Vasty Wilds\nThe game includes 13 Root cards (the initial layout of the game), 77 Forest cards (placed by the players during the game), 4 pawns, 8 damage markers, 20 objectives (5 each of 4 colors), 4 status tokens (used to track special conditions), 2 six-sided dice, and a rules sheet.\n\"A creative little map-building race game; the artwork is fantastic and as I said, every game you play is going to be different, 1. because of how you're going to build the map and 2. because of the amount of cards. I liked it, and I hope you get a chance to check it out.\" - Bearded Meeple\nThe pawns and damage markers\n\"One of the things I really love about this game is that it has that double-edged sword, so there is always something good that's going to happen every turn, and something bad that's going to happen every turn. I think this game is fantastic for families.\" - Cloak and Meeple\nThe Root cards (left) and Forest cards\n\"At this point in time (and maybe over 200 posts later) I\u2019ve come to appreciate the effort that goes into custom work.

Every once and a while I run into some really innovative ideas turned board game and just \u201cwow\u201d at the opportunity to witness this.\" - Indietabletop\nStatus tokens, objectives, and dice\nThe game begins with the placement of the Home card in the center of the table. The Root cards are then placed (all 12 for a two-player game, 8 for a three-player game, and 6 for a four-player game). Placements are valid if the red arrow on the card overlaps the blue dot on the target card.\nPlayers move their pawns only on the white-bordered spaces. On each player's turn, she has two options: place or redraw. Placing a card grants the player progress and causes an opponent misfortune. Redrawing allows the player to move 1d6 spaces and draw three new cards.\nThe goal of each player is to gather all of her objectives. When a card instructs players to place objectives, the opponent to the left of a player places an objective on any white space. This is repeated until all players have placed an objective for an opponent.\nThe full version of the rules for desktop are here.

However, it will be available in limited supply at conventions, through contests, online at the BGG promo store, and directly from Gamelyn Games.\nIn Tiny Epic Western, you are the boss! And upon your boss card, you will keep track of your posse and your influence.\nYou'll be sending your posse members around town to play poker, gain influence, and purchase buildings.\nEach location offers compelling options of where to place your posse members. Like using a building there, gaining instant influence, or doubling down for extra influence at the risk of not getting any.  \nYou will play a poker hand at EACH location you send a posse member to.\nWinning will get you the \"poker pot\" and any extra influence from a \"double down\" spot. You will need this influence for acquiring buildings later on in the round.\nThe Sheriff's Office is a unique location offering players the ability to change the value or suit of their poker card. It also offers a way to acquire an extra building each round and even activate your 3rd posse member! \nBEWARE! If you're standing in the way of your opponent, they can send their posse member in for a duel and possibly take your spot!\nFighting doesn't go unnoticed around here, or unrewarded for that matter, it is the wild west after all. The winner of the last duel always takes the wanted card.\nAfter the locations have been resolved, and players have gained influence for their winning poker hands, a buying phase occurs. Players can now use their influence to acquire one building from a location where they have a posse member. Remember, hitting up the Sheriff's Office can get you an extra buy during this phase; that can be a real game changer!\nBuildings offer you victory points, access to their abilities, and industry influence. \nAt the end of each round, the player who had the best poker hand at the Town Hall advances one of three industries forward in their rank.\nAt the end of six rounds,or as many bullets as a revolver can hold, the game is over. The industries have now been ranked 1st through 3rd and the majority share holders (players with the most industry influence) will be paid bonus victory points respectively. Players add that to the sum of their victory points gained from acquired buildings, with the wanted player gaining an extra 2, and the player who has the most victory points is the winner!  \nClick to enlarge! *this stretch goal does not increase the card count of base or deluxe.\n                                             Upgrades the Premium Print 'N Play and will also be made public on BGG for all TEG players.

To offset this, while remaining fiscally responsible, we have included a small discount for ALL shipping, but no shipping is free.\nRegarding customs: because this game comes in a tiny box with a low declaration, most international backers, of 1 and 2 copies, will not get hit with customs or import fees. The games will be delivered right to your door.

We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 75% complete.

Having worked with them for over 3 years, we are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way. They have fulfilled all our projects and have proven to be communicative, punctual and respectful when dealing with our customers. \n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication.

Please check our Update #4 for more information and how to help us & our backers to reach the goal.\n$50K Python Support: we will add a Python interpreter\n$100K Dev Apps: for both Android & iOS, you will be able to send Arduino / JavaScript / Python code to Duo via Wi-Fi or Particle Cloud\nIntroduction\nThe Duo is a thumb-size development board designed to simplify the process of building Internet of Things (IoT) products. The Duo provides everything you need\u2014Wi-Fi, BLE and a powerful Cloud backend, all in a compact form factor that makes it ideal for your first prototype, a finished product, and everything in between.\nWe\u2019re also introducing the RBLink, an expansion board for the Duo that allows you to attach additional sensors and modules without any soldering. You'll have all the tools you need to get your prototype up and running in no time.\nWi-Fi + BLE\nThe Duo is your Bluetooth gateway to the Internet of Things. It allows you to communicate with your projects both over the web and with your phone, enabling a wide range of cool interactions. Would you like to build a front door lock that can be opened using a phone and whose settings can be changed wirelessly to give access to additional people? Maybe connected lights that turn on as your phone comes in range but can also be controlled when you\u2019re miles away from home? Wi-Fi + BLE also means you can do make your wearable products extra interesting by adding things like beacons and data collection. Oh and robots! Whether you\u2019re in the same room or halfway around the world, the Duo gives you all the connectivity you\u2019ll need to control, interact, monitor, and play with your awesome new creations.\nWi-Fi & BLE Bridge Demo\nRedBear Duo connects with eight BLE Peripherals as BLE Central and iPhone via Wi-Fi, background information available on our website.\nPLAY\n\nFeatures\nThere are a few things that are important to all connected devices\u2014here are a few details:\nConnectivity: How does the Duo communicate with the outside world? \nThe Duo contains both Wi-Fi and BLE capabilities. This means your project can communicate locally with Bluetooth enabled devices and can also connect to your local Wi-Fi network to interact with anything else on the web. The Duo is built around the Broadcom BCM43438, a Wi-Fi 802.11b/g/n plus Bluetooth 4.1 (Dual Mode) combined chipset. They share the same 2.4GHz antenna and can run at the same time. This gives you the flexibility to utilize the most suitable wireless technology(s) for your project.\nDevelopment: How do I program the Duo?\nThe Duo gives you four development platforms/languages to choose from: \nArduino IDE - The most popular development platform used by makers, it's easy to learn and comes with plenty of references guides.\nParticle Web IDE, Dev and CLI - A development platform that allows you to program your Duo online and wirelessly.  You can be miles away and still be able to do your tweaking of your Duo.  \nJavaScript - Yes. If you know JavaScript already, you are ready to go! We are porting an open source JavaScript interpreter for microcontroller to the Duo. You could control all the I/Os, Wi-Fi and BLE connections with JavaScript only and without the need of compilation.\nBroadcom WICED SDK - An advanced development platform where you can do low-level tweaking.  With the WICED SDK, Duo can support Classic Bluetooth which you can build audio or streaming data devices. If you have Apple MFi license, you can even develop your Apple HomeKit project with Duo and WICED.\nWe will also provide sample projects and sample code for both Android and iOS on our website and our GitHub page.\nLive Programming Demo\nNo special effects: Arduino IDE, JavaScript and Particle WebIDE.\nPLAY\n\nCloud: What about the Cloud?\nThanks to our partner, Particle, every Duo will come out of the box with built-in Cloud service. With just a few clicks you will be connected to the Cloud seamlessly. Not only that, the Cloud service is FREE for the lifetime of your Duo*. You can push any changes and data via Cloud right from the start. \nAdd-Ons: How do I use the Duo with modules such as LED lights or sensors?\nWith the RedBear RBLink you can easily attach modules from the Seeed\u2019s Grove System to your project. No need to pull out your soldering iron--just attach your sensors and actuators with jumper wires to the RBLink and you\u2019re ready to go. Looking to attach your own sensor or peripheral? The Duo is breadboard and solder friendly, so you\u2019re never limited in what you can connect to the web. \nPartners\nWe don't work alone. We connect with other IoT companies to bring Maker community together and better user experiences.\nBlueKitchen - We are collaborating with BlueKitchen to integrate their BTstack with the Duo.\nBTstack is BlueKitchen's implementation of the official Bluetooth stack. It is a dual-mode Bluetooth (BLE + Bluetooth Classic) stack, with small memory footprint and available as ANSI-C source code.

Over to you Kedric!\nSETUP\nThe setup for Cadaver is very easy. Every player receives 5 cards at random from a central deck. Then 2 of each arcane resource (2 brains, 2 potions & 2 scrolls) are placed face up in the center of the table.\nA TURN\nCadaver is played over several rounds, with each player taking a turn. A turn consists of:\n1. Play up to 2 Cards from your hand.\n2. Draw 2 cards from the deck or resource piles or a combination of both as long as you draw only 2 cards. Only players who manage to lay any accomplices (mad scientist = potions, witch doctor = brains, wizard = scrolls) are allowed to draw these central resources.\n3. Trade with other players.\nIf you manage to raise a corpse during your turn you return all of the arcane resources to the resource piles in the center of the table. You score the corpse at the end of the game. The player with the highest score wins!\nWe are offering the following add-ons:\nAbout our add-ons\nRocket Race is a rocket building non-collectible card game in which players compete to build steampunk rockets!

Only discovering gaming in his late twenties, he almost immediately transitioned from player to designer. Originally inspired to write games as a way to challenge industry conventions, Kedric now has to write games to keep all the ideas from taking over his limited brain space.\nProject Manager for Triple Ace Games\nRobin Elliott is co-owner of Triple Ace Games and has many years experience working in the games industry as a designer and artist. He now manages all of Triple Ace Games' tabletop projects and continues to create his own game inventions when he has spare time, which is not often enough!\nArtist\nAugustinas Raginskis is a Lithuanian born illustrator and is a product designer, graphic designer and illustrator. After attending art and design focused schools, he graduated with a degree in design from Vilnius Art Academy in 2015. Throughout most of his studies he also continued deepening his knowledge and skill in various art mediums on his own, eventually switching to digital media and proceeding to work as a freelancer on independent games and various illustration projects. His work is the combination of the roots in traditional art mediums and design together with digital illustration, which is his passion.\nWe know how great Cadaver is and want to share the game with you!

All leavened with the occasional board and card game review.\n\"In comparison to earlier card games from Triple Ace Games, Cadaver: A Game of Lighthearted Necromancy is very light.... This is not to demean Cadaver, which is a pleasing if simple game. It does play better with more players and with more cards, so that it is better game with two decks even if there are two or three players, but four players seems a good number.\"", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe design and all of the artwork has been completed for Cadaver, so we know exactly what will be going into the final product. We also have a great deal of experience in the field of games publishing. We learned a lot from publishing the Rocket Race card game, and we think we can deliver this project without problems.\n\nHowever, things can go wrong with anything that goes into a manufacturing process. We have identified that delays in artwork delivery and delays in manufacturing could happen. So we have allowed additional time in our schedule to enable us to navigate any delay issues. If all goes to plan, we may even be able to deliver the project a little sooner.\n\nWe understand the printing process as we have printed a good number of books and games previous to this project, and we know how to communicate our ideas to the printer. We have discussed proofing requirements, so we know that when the printing press is started our product will match our specification requirements.\n\nWith projects like this there is nearly always something that costs more so it is good business sense to have some contingency for this, which we have built in to our costs.\n\nNo matter what problems may occur we will always keep our backers and supporters informed of all issues so that you are aware of the situation and how we are dealing with it.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #15", "update_userinfo": "Our Latest Project - Shards of Madness", "update_content": "Dear Backers\nWe wanted to let you know about the next board game project from Triple Ace Games!\nShards of Madness - A Game of Competing Cultists!\nIn Shards of Madness, players take on the role of fanatical cultists bent on bringing about the end of days.

Therefore I now need to raise money to help turn my vision into the final production of the film. \nIn exchange for your support and pledge I will be delighted to share my experience in producing this fascinating film and offer exclusive rewards.

Whilst I already own a lot of the equipment required to make this film I will also need to invest in some specialist equipment.\nI want this film to not only contain amazing material but look and sound stunning, I will be getting the film professional colour graded and will be working with a composer to create all the music for the film. Unfortunately this requires money I do not have. \nI want this film to be entered into as many film festivals as possible but this cost money, it can range from $20 to $300 to have your film submitted into a festival. If the film is accepted into a festival it can really help to establish the film and increase its circulation.

Additional equipment will be purchased, using pledge money, to ensure a high quality production and finished product.    \nWe will be filming in 4k using the Lumix GH4\nEditing\nThe team will be working with an independent studio to edit and overlay the bespoke sound track.\nThe studio will be using both Adobe Premier CC and After Effects to perfect the edit before forwarding to the composer and colour grader. This should ensure state of the art quality is delivered in the final film. \nJohn Cordy will be composing the music for the film.\n Film Festivals\nThis is one of the most important ways of promoting the final movie. We will be seeking to enter \"Miniature Wargaming The Movie\" into numerous film festivals around the world. If successful this will increase awareness of this fascinating and exciting competitive hobby. \nRecognition at a film festival can boost exposure for the movie.\nInternationally Recognised Awards\nWe will be submitting the film to many film festivals.\nSupport and Rewards\nI need as much help and support as possible in order to make this film happen.

Each scenario presents different quests that must be fulfilled in order to be victorious, and various monsters the heroes will need to defeat on their way. The monsters react to the heroes' actions, so no one is stuck playing the role of game master.\nThe Heroes of Arcadia!\nAs the heroes defeat their enemies and accomplish quests, their guilds rake in the coins, which will then allow them to acquire all sorts of powerful loot! From legendary weapons and armor, to new abilities and magic items. The combination of each hero's unique ability with all the different upgrades they earn through the campaign allows players to create amazing and unexpected combos!\nThe Monsters of Inferno!\nInferno is a standalone box, but also fully compatible with previous Arcadia Quest boxes. It contains a full campaign with 12 scenarios for players to explore. As players progress through the circles of Inferno, deeper and deeper into the Underworld, the campaign branches into two distinct paths. The path not taken results in quests the players will not fulfill, and therefore consequences that will come back to haunt them towards the end of the campaign.\nThe Angels. Will they help or hinder you?\nOne such key choice are the Angels. These secret protectors of Arcadia have been imprisoned by the Underlord, who is trying to corrupt them. If players rescue these Angels, they become powerful additions to their Guilds. But beware, the Angels that are abandoned to their fate will be consumed and come back as monsters to seek revenge on the heroes!\nProduction plastic miniatures of the Inferno monsters, angels, and heroes.\nGoing down into the infernal depths presents the heroes of Arcadia with a new set of challenges and opportunities, in the form of Damnation! This dark power permeates everything in Inferno, and daring heroes may want to use it to their advantage (and face the consequences). Weapons and equipment found in Inferno may become more powerful if a hero takes Damnation, monsters may offer the choice of taking Damnation instead of wounds (or flat out dealing Damnation to their target). However, accumulating Damnation may come at a high price. Some Upgrades are more effective against heroes with Damnation, some monsters more powerful against them, and specially Brimstone cards scattered through the scenarios may activate monsters to attack heroes who dabble too much in the dark powers!\nMany of the Upgrade cards use Damnation to punish or reward heroes.\nArcadia Quest: Inferno comes with:\n36 highly detailed figures, including:\n  12 Hero figures\n  5 Angel figures\n  19 Monster figures (6x Demoness, 6x Harpy, 2x Demon Pitcher, 2x Cerberus, Belly'aal, The Judge, The Underlord)\n12 color plastic bases\n8 Attack dice \n6 Defense dice \n9 double-sided game tiles \n4 guild dashboards \n276 cards\n300+ tokens\nCampaign Sheet pad\nRulebook\nCampaign Book\nExplore a brand new campaign, and add Pets to any Arcadia Quest experience with the Optional Buy Arcadia Quest: Pets expansion!\nFind out everything about the Pets Optional Buy box HERE.\nIf you wish to extend your campaign beyond the 6th scenario, don't miss out on the ultimate showdown with the Frost Dragon expansion box!\nFind out everything about the Frost Dragon Optional Buy box HERE.\nThe mad fight against the Chaos Dragon also takes place after the 6th scenario and brings a whole new epic experience to Arcadia Quest!\n Find out everything about the Chaos Dragon Optional Buy box HERE.\nNo epic campaign can end without a showdown against the majestic Fire Dragon!\nFind out everything about the Fire Dragon Optional Buy box HERE.\nHell of a Pledge - $100\nThe Hell of a Pledge gives you an Arcadia Quest: Inferno core box, the Kickstarter Exclusive Hero King David III, and all applicable Stretch Goals we manage to unlock!\nKing David III is a natural born leader.

We'll sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed and we've sent out our Pledge Manager.\nPlease Take Note\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in Germany (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$15 to most states. $30 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \nCANADA: $10-$20 to most cities. \nLATIN AMERICA: $50-$60 to most countries. \nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $30 to most other countries (we can't predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). \nOCEANIA: $13-$25 to Australia. $30 to New Zealand. \nAFRICA: $70 to most countries. \nEUROPE: $10 to Germany. \n  $15-$30 to most other countries. \n  $35 to Norway, Finland, Estland, Lettland, and Latvia. \n  $40 to Bosnia/Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia. \n  $55 to Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Romania. \n  $60 to Iceland, Russia, and Israel. \n  $70 to Greece, Turkey, and Ukraine. \nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available in conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.

Each project is entirely independent from each other, has completely different development teams, and has no effect on the production flow or development of Arcadia Quest: Inferno.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 60 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 60 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 60 days close of the campaign are processed via Paypal only. Refunds within 60 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, we will treat it as abandoned and will refund or ship on a case by case basis.\n\nBy pledging to this Kickstarter, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the Kickstarter) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project is active.

As my kids get into the age where they enjoy playing board/card games, I find myself yearning for my gaming roots - tabletop Role-Playing Games (RPG). \nYet, when I first thought about bringing my kids down the tabletop RPG road, I also realized that my free time is limited. Surely there are games out there which offer that type of experience with little (or no) burden on a parent to prepare & run adventures? And the game is not so \"kiddie\" that a die-hard tabletop RPG'er won't just get bored?\nWell, the question if such a game exists is now moot - Young Wizards is that game!\nAbout the Game\nYoung Wizards is a card-based tabletop RPG where each player assumes the role of a... Well... A Young Wizard. \nEach wizard has a deck of cards representing their spells, equipment and other features (like race). That deck can grow more powerful over time as the player adventures into twisting caverns and dark forests, discovering treasures & gaining experience.\nAdventure far & wide, find loot! (card designs not final)\nAll of that sounds great, and can be done with other tabletop RPGs. How does Young Wizards differ?\nThe game can be played without a Game Master(GM)/Dungeon Master. \nIf played with a GM, setting up adventures & encounters is a breeze, leaving you more time to focus on your story.\nThe card-based approach provides the perfect \"bridge\" between younger players and the deeper world of tabletop RPGs. \nThe Setting \nYoung Wizards takes place in the Age of Heroes game world, and marks the first commercially available game in that setting. \nThe shining kingdoms and their armies of ages past are long-gone. As the scattered peoples awaken from centuries of darkness, heroes emerge to carve a future for their clans & families. And now, the first few Wizard Academies have begun to reclaim their towers and forgotten power. \nYou are part of this next generation of Wizards, and your motivations are your own. Are you seeking knowledge for personal gain or for the greater good? Will you take your place amongst the legends during the Age of Heroes?\n\u201cA hero has the whole world for his tomb.\u201d \u2013 Unknown\nCharacter Creation\nCreating your wizard couldn't be easier! \nChoose a race\nChoose a school of magic\nChoose a starting Weapon, Robe and Spellbook\nThat's it!\nThe 4 Schools of Magic in the Starter Set: Light, Runes, Illusion & Astral\nFor younger players, pre-made decks of starting wizards are outlined in the rule book.\nGameplay Mechanics\nThe Character/Wizard Deck\nEach player starts out with a small deck of cards comprised of Basic spell cards from one school of magic, their race card and a few starting equipment cards. As the player adventures, they can improve & expand on their deck, upgrading their cards and (if they wish) developing a strategy not unlike deck building in typical Trading-Card-Games (TCGs).\nThe main difference between Young Wizards & a TCG, however, is the adventuring & permanence aspects. In Young Wizards, the player takes their deck into perilous dungeons over the span of weeks, months and even years. \nDeep Simplicity\nMany tabletop RPGs have volumes of rulebooks spanning everything from starting a campfire to battling a dragon. A typical character is comprised of 1 or more sheets of paper covered with stats, equipment lists and a ton of pencil/eraser work. \nAnd all of that is fine!\nHowever, when introducing the rich gaming experience of tabletop RPGs to a younger generation, a simpler approach may be beneficial. Card games like UNO, Go-Fish and even Rummy are easily understood by kids starting at age 6. So, delivering a similar experience of drawing & playing cards seems like the perfect introduction to tabletop RPG/board games.\nEach card is uncluttered and younger players should be able to understand the simple gameflow. \nDefense cards can be played when the player is attacked by a monster!\nOf course, more experienced players may want to strategize their decks just like they would for a TCG. Exciting combos, player cooperation and much more awaits.\nAdventure!\nEverything needed to adventure with or without a Game Master (GM) is provided in the various card sets. Game groups can choose to explore an adventure deck, with randomization of cards providing great replay value. Or, perhaps, someone in the group wishes to tackle the role of GM and craft adventures for the wizards to challenge. Young Wizards provides that flexibility!\nAdventure Decks can be challenged for epic fun\nThe other challenge for dad or mom GMs is simply TIME. How do you find the time to delve through Monster Manuals and GM-Guides to craft adventures for your players? Well, Young Wizards solves that problem too! \nSince all enemies are rated at the group level (all goblins are in one deck, rated at the lowest base difficulty) and also at the individual card level (each card in the goblin deck has a difficulty rating), generating a new encounter for the players takes SECONDS as you reach for the correct deck and settle on the difficulty. This allows the GM to perhaps write down some loose story notes on a piece of paper and leaves all the crunchy numbers/balancing aspects to encounter design to the game decks.\nArmored goblins may be difficult to defeat with swords or Earth spells\nWhen battle eventually does happen, Young Wizards provides simple rules to conduct the battle (with or without a GM) on a \"battleboard\".\nPlayers and enemies align in the front or back rows on the battleboard (early mock-up)\nPlayers also use their wizard deck to overcome non-combat challenges in each adventure. \nThen, at the end of the adventure, each player can choose a reward from the dungeon boss which can include epic loot (added right to their deck!) and/or a new/replacement spell card.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nUnfortunately, we aren't artists. Art costs money, and that is where the small amount of $ we are asking for will go:\nWizard Card Art\nRace Card Art\nBox Art\nCustomize your character with spells from many different schools of magic\nThis Kickstarter will result in the development of the STARTER SET and ADVANCED SET of cards for Young Wizards:\nSTARTER SET (1-4* players)\n4 Schools of Magic\n4 Wizard cards\n1 Starter Loot deck\n1 Common Loot deck\n1 Adventure deck\n1 Enemy deck\nHuman Racial Cards\n* The player limit can be raised by purchasing another STARTER SET and/or the ADVANCED SET\nADVANCED SET\nRequires the STARTER SET\n2 Battleboards (Cave, Forest)\n20 wooden health markers\n1 additional School of Magic (Alchemy) \n1 additional Race (Dwarf)\n1+ new Wizard cards\n1 additional Adventure deck\n1 additional Enemy deck\n1 Uncommon Loot deck\nAdditional cards for the Common & Starter Loot decks\nAdditional cards for STARTER SET schools of magic\n10 Red \"lose health\" tokens\n10 Green \"gain health\" tokens\nSupports 1 additional player\nAlchemy is planned for the Advanced Set\nFUNDING ALLOCATION\nA complete breakdown of funding allocation:\nAdd-Ons\n          Stretch Goals\nA Note on Rewards  \nWe're allowing the community to have a hand in the development of the game, but there are some guidelines which must be followed.

We don't use a pledge manager\u2014backers may NOT increase their pledge or add on more items at the KS prices after the campaign ends. Future pre-orders and add-ons can be made on our website.\nDesigned by Jamey Stegmaier (Viticulture & Euphoria) and based on the art and worldbuilding of Jakub Rozalski, Scythe is a 4x game (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) set in an alternate-history, 1920s Eastern Europe. Scythe tells the stories of 5 factions competing over an unclaimed patch of land surrounding the mysterious Factory.\nDuring Scythe's 750+ blind playtests, the playtesters consistently said they most enjoyed:\nthe dual benefits of the upgrade system (increase an action benefit and decrease a cost)\nthe distinctly different faction and mech abilities\nthe thematic choices presented by the encounter cards\nthe asymmetry and variability created by random pairings of faction and player mats\nthe twist to area control due to all resources being kept on the board\nCheck out the Scythe rules and playtest print-and-play files to see how Scythe blends an engine-building system inspired by Terra Mystica with a deterministic combat system influenced by Kemet. Renders of the 25 miniatures in Scythe are below the \"What's in the Box?\" image.\nTo add items onto your pledge, manually add the $ amount during the project. We don't use a pledge manager, so all pledges must be made in full by November 5. You can mix and match up to 3 total games (any version) and any number of add-ons. On the post-project survey, you will tell us the various items that comprise your pledge.\nEach player is represented on the board by a character and their animal companion (1 miniature). Each character miniature has a 25mm base and a height of 36-58mm.\nEach faction has 4 mechs in their faction color that can be deployed during the game. Each mech miniature has a 30mm base and a height of 26-36mm.\nThis is an example of a faction mat (the Rusviet faction). This shows your faction's special ability, starting military strength, mech abilities, and one-time recruit benefits.\n                                                                                                                                                        This is an example of a player mat (\"Patriotic\"). Each player mat is divided into four sections, each with a top-row action and a bottom-row action. Your actions improve as you build your economic engine.\nThe highly detailed game board for Scythe (full board on left, sample territory on right) depicts the areas near the mysterious Factory. This is a fully-formed world with a specific story, so the board is not modular (see FAQ for more details).\n                                             All promo items are included in every Kickstarter game for free and will be available for additional cost post-Kickstarter (there is no Kickstarter-exclusive content).

We'll even pay for return shipping.\nThe Factory promo pack contains 6 extra Factory cards for Kickstarter backers. The promo pack will be available for an additional cost to those who discover Scythe after the Kickstarter campaign.\nIt may not be these exact Factory cards that end up in the promo pack.\nThe custom metal coins  (80 total) featured in the Premium, Collector's, and Art Connoisseur Edition games were designed specifically for Scythe. The set of coins is available for order by itself on the Stonemaier Games website for $25 (+ shipping) or as an add-on to any copy of the game for $22.\nThe plastic resource containers (4 total) in the Premium, Collector's, and Art Connoisseur Edition games allow for easy storage, setup, and distribution of the various tokens and coins in Scythe. There's room for exactly 4 of these containers in the Scythe box.\nPlastic container with coin prototypes.\nThe board extension in the Collector's and Art Connoisseur Editions slides next to the back side of the game board, creating a complete board with +50% bigger hexes (the content is the same; see Update 3). All units and resources in Scythe are kept on the board, so the larger hexes provide more space.\nThe game board is 624x818mm, and it grows to 818x936mm with the extension. It is available as an add-on to any copy of the game for $10 (every game board is double-sided) and will be available to order from our website by itself for $12 (+ shipping) after the project ends.\nThe realistic resource tokens (made out of resin or zinc) in the Collector's and Art Connoisseur Editions replace the wooden resource tokens (there are no wooden resource tokens in those editions). They include 80 tokens (20 each) for food, metal, oil, and wood. These tokens are available in our treasure chests (one in each chest), as well as in an add-on to any copy of the game for $21.\nThe individually-numbered boxes in the Collector's and Art Connoisseur Editions are randomly assigned. The limit of these boxes will be determined by the total number of backers at those levels.\nThe art book included with the Art Connoisseur Edition is a 100-page, full-color, hardback collection of the art featured in Scythe, as well as other pieces in Jakub Rozalski's acclaimed 1920s series. The book will measure approximately 250x290mm. It's available for pre-order by itself on the Stonemaier Games website for $25 (+ shipping) or as an add-on to any copy of the game for $23. The art book will be packed externally from the game box.\nThe wooden resource tokens aren't in the Collector's and Art Connoisseur Editions, so if you want both one of those games and wooden resources (or if you just want extra resources with any version of Scythe), please add $10 to your pledge. This is for an external pack of 20 food/grain, 20 metal, 20 wood, and 20 oil tokens.\nSamples on the left; final colors on the right.\nWe ship games in bulk to fulfillment centers around the world to reduce customs fees & VAT and to keep shipping prices low (this method is explained here; country codes are here).\nBackers are limited to 3 total games per pledge (a mix of any 3 versions of the game is fine; only pay the shipping fee once per pledge, not once per game). To add more games beyond the first (or add-ons), manually enter the $ total when making your pledge or click the blue \"Manage\" button next to a previously made pledge.\nAn example of an encounter card. When your character reaches certain parts of the board, they encounter a situation that gives you a choice of one of the three options.\nWe like to support game stores around the world by offering the special Kickstarter versions of the game to retailers during the campaign. We treat retailer backers just like other backers in that they receive their rewards before we release regular retail games into distribution.\nIf you're a retailer, please contact Jamey at stonemaiergames@gmail.com during the campaign for pricing information. After the campaign, you can reserve retail copies of Scythe by contacting our distribution broker: paul@greaterthangames.com\nAn example of an objective card.

Chandler, and features original Scythe music composed by Micha\u0142 Wo\u017aniak. The gif explaining the board extension was designed by Bryce Walter and reduced in size for faster loading times by Bruce Alcorn.\nPlaytesters: The development process for Scythe featured over 750 blind playtests and 628 individual playtesters. We owe a huge debt of gratitude to all of them, especially to Barry Schmaling (who built the playtester forum) and all of the lead playtesters. They had a lot to say about Scythe, but here are a few of our favorite quotes:\n\u201cFarm your little piece of the world, spread out and colonise as much as you can, or rampage with mechs projecting lethal force over your opponents. This game has it all and with so many routes to victory, no two games are the same.\u201d \u2014 Stephen \u2018Azrael\u2019 Ogden\n\u201cScythe is an excellent blend of resource management and conflict which also manages to leave you with a delightful sense of having told a story.\" \u2014 Andrew Busam\n\u201cThe Automa is challenging, relentless, and at times unforgiving, but it's also a whole lot of fun. It's a worthy adversary that earns a begrudging respect.\u201d \u2014 Jeremiah Power\nWhile we don't offer existing inventory or unrelated products as add-ons through Kickstarter, we offer other Stonemaier products on our website. These items will ship right away and cannot be held until Scythe ships.\nViticulture, Tuscany, Euphoria, Between Two Cities, and our treasure chests are also available from your friendly local game store.\nJamey's book, A Crowdfunder's Strategy Guide: Build a Better Business by Building Community, is available in a number of online and offline locations.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThrough Stonemaier Games, Jamey Stegmaier has raised over $1.4 million on Kickstarter and has delivered over 20,000 individual rewards to backers within a few months of the estimated delivery date (most are on time or early). He is an avid backer and gamer, and his book about crowdfunding was published in September 2015: http://stonemaiergames.com/kickstarter/book/\n\nHowever, Scythe presented three specific new challenges: miniatures, shipping, and balance.\n\nThis is our first time working with plastic miniatures. We had heard horror stories about other projects involving miniatures, and we've experienced a few as backers. So we wanted to start early to avoid some of the delays that can occur as the result of miniatures. We started working with Jakub and his 3D modelers in March, using Shapeways to print each version of the sculpts to see how they worked on the game board. We also worked closely with Panda's team throughout the process to make sure the sculpts are feasible and durable. We've created the molds for the miniatures and are ready for production.\n\nWe've picked up and dropped fulfillment partners over time, keeping those who pack our games well and excel at communication. Because shipping is particularly important for Scythe\u2014a big game with a box that we want delivered in pristine condition\u2014we tested out two new-to-us fulfillment partners (Funagain in the US and Snakes & Lattes in Canada) on our previous project in preparation for Scythe. We add those two to Ideaspatcher in Europe, Good Games in Australia, and Agility in China, all three of which we've worked on in the past and have had excellent results.\n\nOne of the main features of Scythe's gameplay is asymmetry between factions. It's tough to balance an asymmetric game, so after we got Scythe to a good place with local playtesters, we ran 3 different waves of multi-player blind playtesting and 2 waves of solo blind playtesting. The huge amount of anecdotal and quantitative data we collected as a result helped us ensure that Scythe is extremely well balanced (and fun!).\n\nIf you would like to know more about what we learned from our Kickstarter experiences and research, go to http://stonemaiergames.com/kickstarter/full-list-chronological/ to see 160+ Kickstarter Lessons to help you create a successful project too.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #46", "update_userinfo": "Introducing the Scythe Modular Board", "update_content": "Hi!

I hope you got plenty of sleep last night, because Sensei Saru has a full day of training in store for you! So study your lessons well, and be quicker and craftier than your fellow campers, as Sensei only invites the best to be his personal apprentices. Will it be YOU?!\nNinja Camp pits animal martial artist clans against one another in a training exercise where the best clan will become the personal ninja apprentices of Sensei Saru. Each player starts with two cards, each representing a ninja skill, with the rest of the deck making up the game board. By using the cards in their hand, players navigate the board, adding new skills to their hand as they do\u2014and leaving fewer movement options for their fellow campers. Each player also has a unique ninja ability that he can use once per game to try to turn the game in his favor. A game that sets up and plays in thirty minutes or less, Ninja Camp is sure to provide hours of fun for families and future ninjas!\nNinja Camp was designed by Adam E. Daulton and is the newest Small Box/Big Fun game from Action Phase Games. It is a family-friendly 2-4 player tactical card game that plays in under 30 minutes. We encourage you to view the videos directly below for more information. Or simply peruse a rough draft of the rulebook here!\n\nThe Badges & Activities mini-expansion for Ninja Camp introduces two new types of cards. At the beginning of each game, you can choose to play with a Badge card, an Activity card, or both. To play with either card type, you simply draw one and place it faceup so that everyone can see it. It is not a part of the grid that you will move your ninjas around on. The twelve Activities cards add a some complexity to the game by introducing a new rule for that game. Many of these will allow you to use the skill cards in new ways. Badge cards reward players for collecting the most of the associated card. For example, if the Leap Badge card is revealed at the beginning of the game, the player with the most Leap skill cards at the end of the game will receive two points. With most games of Ninja Camp being decided by just a few points, these two points can make all the difference!\nTo receive this mini-expansion, simply pledge for the NINJA MASTER or LEGENDARY NINJA reward level.

There are unique sets of rules for two, three, and four players. The winner is the player who manages to match the colors on the back of their double sided cards with their goal pattern. You must maintain the perspective of the cards so that you never see the back side of your own cards.\nPerspective can be played with 2 to 4 players or as a solitaire game. 2-4 player games are played with a hand of 3 cards. Each card is double-sided, so when held one side is facing toward the player and the other is facing their opponents. The front side of the cards will determine what actions a player may take. When a card is played, it is placed into the Used Pile with the front side of the card face up.  \nEach player has a goal card placed in front of them on the table, their objective is to get the Back Side of their hand to match the colors and order of their goal hand. At any point during a player\u2019s turn, they may lay down their 3 cards without tampering to see if their goal is met. If the player\u2019s cards do not match the goal card, they are eliminated from the game.\nA game for 2-4 players ages 9 and up that plays in less than 15 minutes.  \nIf you like Hanabi you'll love Perspective.

He told me about his game and we sat down to play. It took him about 2 minutes to explain the game, and we started our first game. I couldn\u2019t believe how easy yet fun it was. Perspective is beautifully done. Even the artwork is beautiful. Where a card with just a plain color would suffice, this developer took it the extra mile to make the card very visually appealing. Over Gen Con weekend, I played this game with many people. Some friends who are long-time gamers, some who are new, and even friends who work for other game companies who evaluate and play games for a living. Everyone loved it. I lost count as to how many times I played it over the weekend. I never once grew tired of it. Each hand was a fresh set of challenges. All in all the game is a lot of fun to play, quick to learn, and quick to play. Of the games I played over the Gen Con weekend, Perspective was the clear winner for me.\"\nSHIPPING\nWe are paying around $2 toward shipping for all backers. That makes USA shipping included, but for other countries we must charge what USPS charges us (minus the $2). Make sure you only back the reward level for your region. We will ship with a value of $10 which should avoid VAT and import taxes in most countries. We've attempted many methods of dealing with shipping to Europe, and ended up losing money on all of them.

Uninspired by what is currently available to children, we\u2019re setting out to make a magazine that taps into a child\u2019s creative, adventurous and caring spirit.\nI AM GOODY is a quarterly magazine for girls and boys aged 6 - 12 years old that dares to be different. It is inspiring. It is beautiful. It is unique. GOODY is creating and celebrating goodness.\nWe want the best for our children. We want to offer them more than our own experiences. When we\u2019re searching for reading material, the first thing we look for is quality. Is this offering my child the best? Magazines are able to do something that books can\u2019t do: they can blur the boundaries of fiction and nonfiction. A well-designed magazine manipulates text, imagery and typography to produce work that is easy to read, entertaining and current.\nWhy is it that we adults can make beautiful, well-designed magazines full of inspiring stories and incredible imagery for ourselves, but when it comes to magazines for our kids, it\u2019s either visual chaos, explosive advertising, or stuck in gender stereotype-land?\nIs not the way we present a magazine influencing a child\u2019s perception of the world?\nIs not the content we provide influencing a child\u2019s perception of the world?\nWhat if we were to say that children deserve more in a magazine?\nThat they deserve to be inspired. To be challenged. To be treated equal.\nKids can do incredible things. Isn't it about time someone reminded them?\nMock up cover for issue 1. Custom cover once project is funded. Cover artist: Tado.\nWe want children to be inspired beyond the ordinary, to see things in a new light and be excited about getting out there and just doing good. That\u2019s why we\u2019re stripping our magazine from all the chaos and unnecessary distractions, and filling its beautiful uncoated pages with the things we love. \nI AM GOODY is a celebration of art, design, culture, food, animals, the environment, adventure, music, stories and games.\nIt is 100% original content. \nOn top of our super interesting child-friendly editorial pieces, we\u2019re working with incredible artists from all around the world who will be creating things just for GOODY! Each issue, we\u2019ll be commissioning an amazing artist to create a one-of-a-kind I AM GOODY cover.\nLullatone, Peskimo and Andrea Kang will be inspiring kiddies on a more regular basis, filling each issue with:\nLullatone will be making musical instruments from their studio in Japan\nPeskimo will be making puzzles and games from their studio in the UK\nAndrea Kang will be making art and craft projects from her studio in the USA\n  If there's one thing we've learned about children, it's this: characters make everything awesome! No matter how fun or clear the writing is, children aren't going to want to read big bodies of text. See all the cute animals on this page? They, and many more, will be your child's new best friends, pointing out interesting facts, telling jokes and just being incredibly cute.\nI AM GOODY is creating goodness through good ideas, good stories and good people.\nIssue one featured artist: Tado\nClimate change and renewable energy\n    War toy project, Brian McCarty\nEndangered species, Green sea turtle\nFreediving\nMarc Fornes and THEVERYMANY\nJapan\nCommunity supported agriculture\nI AM GOODY is not just about looking great and being incredibly fun to read. To do good, we cannot shy away from important issues that really matter. We want to reconnect boys and girls with topics that matter because the stronger the connection, the greater the goodness. We\u2019ll explore conservation, environment, social and humanitarian issues that aren\u2019t discussed enough in school. We\u2019ll meet inspirational heroes and learn how we can all make a difference.\nInterview with Anna Rose, Australian Geographic Conservationist of the Year 2015\n                   Interview with Lucas Handley, Ocean ambassador\nGOODY for all ages.\nIf this all sounds like something that you (a grownup) finds interesting, that's okay! One of the main things we want to do with I AM GOODY is create inspiring and engaging material that all ages can enjoy. We want to create something that parents will happily sit down and share with their children. We want to break down the literary divide and create opportunities for further discussion, for wonder, for participation. Because we know that when you surround yourself with goodness, good things happen.\nFashion and beauty tips. Buzzy colors. Ugly design. Aggressive products. Millions of ads. Basically, all the yucky stuff we don\u2019t like in virtually every other children\u2019s magazine.\nAnything we DO feature is there because we believe in it.\nIt\u2019s no good creating something that isn\u2019t loved. We will be filling GOODY with environmentally friendly uncoated paper and covering it with beautiful art, fun activities, incredible photography and inspiring stories.\nPaperback\nPage number: 44pp + 4pp cover\nSize: Height 279.4mm x width 215.9mm\nCover: 280gsm Knight linen textured paper FSC\nText pages: Uncoated knight smooth 105gsm FSC\nBinding: Burst binding\nPrinting: Offset CMYK printing\nCover: 280gsm Knight linen textured paper, FSC certified\nBinding: Burst binding\nOh, so much!\nIf you support only one Kickstarter project this year, this is a pretty good one to choose. When you support I AM GOODY, you are not just supporting the one project. You are not even supporting the one creator.\nFirstly, you\u2019ll be directly supporting the contributing artists involved in GOODY. We\u2019re incredibly fortunate to know so many talented people who want to be part of GOODY and offer their skills as regular contributors and feature artists. With your support, we\u2019ll be able to fairly compensate our amazing contributors for their time and effort.\nThe minimum we\u2019ve set here is not about making a profit. If we reach the minimum target and no more, we satisfy the printer\u2019s minimum order and can ship these to you. There will be money to pay our contributing and feature artists, Kickstarter fees, and that\u2019s it. We have not factored in our time writing, editing and designing, illustrating, overseeing production, packing or sending Goody away. But that\u2019s okay, because this isn\u2019t about us making a quick fortune. We\u2019re doing this because we honestly and truly believe that children deserve more in a magazine.\nWe\u2019re really excited about this project and see it as the first step towards us starting up an independent publishing press, dedicated to quality children\u2019s work. In fact, if we raise more than our minimum target, this is exactly where the money will go.\nWe want GOODY to be a leader of inspiring and unique publications, offering something that can\u2019t be found elsewhere. We want to grow a Goody community and share experiences that make a difference. We want to give back and support and create community initiatives that children can be part of. We have big plans for GOODY.\nWould you like to be part of something special?\nWhat about subscription?\nOriginally we did have subscription as an option (subscription is definitely what we need in order to continue creating inspiring material) but then we did some math and realised our target would then have to balloon out to over $100K AUD as we'd have to assume minimum fixed costs for a whole year. That amount seemed too much to ask for straight away. What if we didn't reach it? Then Issue 1 wouldn't even get made. That would be too sad to even contemplate. So, whilst we will have subscription available in the future, we unfortunately cannot include it as part of this Kickstarter campaign.  \nAs if infectious energy and creativity wasn\u2019t enough, we\u2019re also pretty good at making things. Before we settled on our love of children\u2019s publishing, we designed and manufactured consumer products and collectible toys, including our awarded Pecanpals and Jibibuts wooden figures, under the name Noferin. Our art and sculptures have been exhibited in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami, Chicago, Toronto, London, Sydney and Melbourne, as well as being published in many books and magazines. We also had a stint at developing a children\u2019s animation series based in the UK.\nHaving designed products and marketing material for over a dozen international brands, Candy now enjoys designing for NGOs and is very proud of designing and art directing the cookbook, Planet to Plate, for WWF and Earth Hour. Currently, we are editor and designer of Submerged Nation, a diving magazine we helped start four years ago. In our spare time, we write and illustrate children\u2019s picture books.\n\nWe want to use the primetime of our career to create something that really matters; to start something that is beyond us and our own personal advancement. I AM GOODY is just the beginning of this journey, but we think it's a pretty good place to start.\nA snippet of our recent projects: www.goodycommunication.com\nFor printing this initial run, we\u2019re keeping things local. Local is good. It is quick, friendly and we have more control. Using our ten years design and publishing experience, we\u2019ve teamed up with a local printer specializing in magazines and books, who said, \u201cToo easy, mate. We\u2019ll have that turned round to you in a jiffy. Fifteen days tops.\u201d Local not only lowers our carbon footprint, it also means we get called mate. How good is that!\nWe can't do this without you, so to show our appreciation for your support, we've put together a little swag of rewards. A note on rewards: our priority here is getting the magazine produced and sent to you before Christmas. Whilst we will try our utmost to have the rewards arrive at the same time, time may not allow us. Most of these rewards are hand-made, and whilst Candy will be full of supporter love, her hands can only move so fast. For this reason, it is best to assume that rewards will arrive in early 2016, separate from Issue 1. Thank you for your patience.\nA copy of issue one.

Even if there was (there isn\u2019t), we\u2019d still be able to complete this project on time because it is something we love and dream about, and everyone knows that when you are chasing something you love and dream about, you will let nothing get in your way to success.

It's designed as a quick game for a relaxing afternoon with friends, and features 50 individually designed cards with Alpine-inspired architecture and decor. \n Biergarten, a game for 2-4 players, is essentially a tile placement game, and players compete as up-and-coming restaurant owners expanding their outdoor patios, or biergartens. Each card features either one or two colors, as well as a wall segment on one, two, or three sides of the card. Players earn points for each color match that they make, and having a match between each of the four colors earns a bonus of three points. Watch out for walls -- they block the flow of the garden, and color matches can't be made through a wall. However, if players can entirely enclose their biergarten within a continuous wall, they earn a six point bonus. \nThe first player to ten points triggers the victory round, with each player thereafter getting one additional turn to top the winning point value.\n In each copy of Biergarten, you will find 58 common cards, 8 home cards, 5 rule cards, 4 player tokens, and 1 double-sided scoreboard.\n We are using top quality components. The cards will be in ivory core with a linen embossed finish, the player tokens are custom wooden tokens with a screen printed design, and the game box will have a full color cardboard tray for the cards and tokens. We are going to be using Panda Games Manufacturing http://pandagm.com/ as our printer. \nWe've sent our prototype to a few awesome reviewers. \n\"Biergarten is a refreshing change of theme and one that is well executed\"\n\"A very approachable building game\"\n http://www.acrosstheboardgames.net/nicole/unter-den-kastanien/\n-\"I gave it a 5(out of 5) because I loved it.\"  \n-\"I can see bringing this to every game night, it's a good filler and it can come out whenever you need a game.\"\n5/5 aesthetics, 5/5 gameplay, 5/5 long term replay-ability.

You can find it here. \n \"Since this is so color reliant, matching up the colors, that they did the patterns to help with color blindness, I thought that was a very cool thing\" \n\"Language independent past the rules\"\nhttp://www.allusgeeks.com/2015/07/initial-impressions-biergarten/\nKeep revisiting this page as more reviews trickle in. We're using this feedback to make the game even better. Look for us at Gen Con where we'll be doing another big playtest session to hammer out the last few tweaks to our game play, including a new scoreboard for 2 player games.\nWe\u2019re doing something special on this project. We understand that no Kickstarter project is created alone. It\u2019s only because of the community behind them that any of these projects make it off the ground. So, we decided the best way to show our thanks is by giving everyone a chance to be drawn into the game. One week after the end of the campaign we will select at least 100 people to be added to our game. We are looking for an equal mix of people from all walks of life, but it wouldn\u2019t hurt your chances to dress for the part. Even if you\u2019re on the fence about this project, we encourage you to head over to our Facebook page for more details on submission guidelines, contest rules, and the photo album where you can submit a photo of yourself. \nYou do not have to back us for your chance to be added to the game, and backing us will not affect your chances one way or the other. All are welcome in our Biergarten! www.facebook.com/biergartengame\n*** This is not the full set of rules, but merely an overview. For the rules as they will appear in the final game, head over to Biergarten\u2019s page on Board Game Geek (http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/178335/biergarten), where you can download a full copy. *** \n To begin, separate the cards into two piles: one pile of common cards with the silver B on the back and one pile of home cards with the crest on the back. After shuffling the deck of common cards, deal out two cards to each player. Then shuffle the home cards, and turn over as many home cards as players, plus one. Players will then choose a home card and place it face up in front of themselves. This is where your biergarten will begin. \n After all players have chosen a home card, return all unused home cards to the box. Then, deal out three common cards face up to form the supply. On their turn, each player will either draw one of these three cards, or they will draw a card face down from the top of the deck. After drawing a card, the player will then play one of the three cards in their hand by placing it adjacent to any card already played in their biergarten.\nThis is where the game\u2019s main mechanic kicks in -- playing cards of the same color next to one another gains points. Players earn one point for every side of the card that touches a matching color. If a card has two colors, it will earn two points if a touching card that matches both colors and one point if touching a card that matches only one of the colors. However, walls break the flow of your garden, and players earn no points for matches that are blocked by a wall. Any card edge that does not have a shield is a wall.\n After playing a card, players may re-arrange their garden a little if they think certain cards could earn more points in a different spot. Players may either swap two cards in play or move one card to anywhere on the board, shifting cards out of the way to make it fit. \nPlayers looking to get ahead can also work towards earning bonus points in one of two ways. Any player who makes at least one match of every color will earn the color bonus, worth an extra 3 points immediately. If a player manages to have a wall on every outside edge of their biergarten, they have earned the walled garden bonus worth 6 points. Players may earn both bonuses on a single play. \n Players continue to take turns placing cards until one player has earned 10 or more points. At this point, all other players will get one final turn to beat the leader. The leader does not get to draw or play any cards in the final round. However, they may still re-arrange their garden one last time to see if they can earn any extra points. Count up the final totals, and declare a winner.

Favorite Board Game: Eight Minute Empire: Legends. \nTogether we are Steamboat Gothic Studio LLC, formed to bring to life games that are easy to learn, quick to play, and dripping with theme. We believe we have succeeded with our first project, Biergarten. Biergarten came to life a little over a year ago when co-founder Andrew wanted to come up with a game that was both strategic and quick that he could play with his wife, co-founder Lauren. She has been beating him at it ever since. After deciding the gameplay was where we wanted it, we locked down our rules, improved our artwork, and formed Steamboat Gothic to bring the game to all of you. \nWe did it! The game will be created, printed and shipped around the world because of you.\nWe will raise the minimum number of people drawn into the game. \nWe will add 18 more cards to the game that will not impede the balance of play but instead allow for even more diverse and exciting biergartens. \nMore Goals can be unlocked !\nWe've done our research and we've reached out to experienced board game manufacturers and to shipping partners to find out what works out best for the campaign and for you. The breakdown is as follows. \n51% Production Costs - This is our biggest costs by far. We decided to go with the highest quality components to start with and we are bound to a minimum printing requirement. We are going to be using Panda Games Manufacturing. Even if you haven't heard of them you've probably played one of their games. They do the best work in the industry and so that's why we're using them. http://pandagm.com/\n30% Shipping Costs - We will be likely handling US shipping on our own, but we have budgeted in more for worldwide shipping.\n10% Fees - This is our 5% Kickstarter fee and our 3-5% charge fees from all the payments. \n8% Prototype - This covers all the money we've spent on the campaign up till now that we'd kinda like to get reimbursed on. This includes but is not limited to Software Licenses, Business Licenses, Webpages, Physical Copies, Event Space, Promotional Materials, and a really sweet banner.\n1% Profit - This is our profit margin, it's what we'll use to grow the business further and what we'll use to enjoy a very well earned break when this is all over. I do promise that not a penny of this fund will be used until the rest of the orders have been placed. \nTimeline Breakdown\nAugust/September - finishing the game, the last push, and all the additional people to be added to the project. \nOctober/November - pre-production. We will submit our game to our manufacturer and they will work with us to make the game ready for mass-production.\nDecember/January - Mass-production. At this stage it will be out of our hands and in the very capable hands of our manufacturing partner, Panda Games Manufacturing. They will send us copies of the game for approval before shipping the bulk games. \nFebruary/March - The games are shipped to us and our worldwide shipping partners.\nMarch/April - We're sending out all the games at this point ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our first Kickstarter project. We've never done anything on this scale before. However we have spent the last few months doing our research, studying other campaigns, talking with other developers, and laying the ground work not just for a good campaign but also for a good product. \n\nThere could be delays in shipping, we are working with a very professional games manufacturer, but this is something we can not directly control. If delays were to arise we would make sure that all backers are well aware of any problems in the pipeline. Post campaign, backers can expect to be contacted through Kickstarter every other week until all copies have been received.\n \nThere could be an un-accounted for costs in any of our categories, to counteract this we've spread an extra thousand dollars through the budget, and if we need more the funds will be pulled from the direct profit. If at any point the costs become too great we will issue refunds to the best of our ability.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Steamboat Gothic Studio\n2 created \u00b7 19 backed\nAndrew Sallwasser \u2013 Artist & Designer.

Then this morning Undead Viking said \"I really dig this game\" \"it's one of those games that has almost no rules...and still manages to be very challenging.\" Please go check it out and tell us what you think of it.\nOne quick clarification I promised everyone of you a place in the credits in gold if you re-pledged. You might notice on the pledges the credits start at the deluxe level and above. This does not apply to you, if you think our game is worth even a dollar of your money you have a spot in there, plus you'll be able to make me eat raw sauerkraut.....seriously.
