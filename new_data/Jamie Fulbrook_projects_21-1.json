[{"backer": "Jamie Fulbrook", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "My name is Foster Huntington, you may have seen my projects The Burning House, the vanlife #tag or the photobook Home Is Where You Park it. Last spring, I started working on a treehouse and skate bowl in the Columbia Gorge with a group of friends. Inspired by the people and places I\u2019d seen during my time on the road as well as childhood dream of building a Treehouse, we started planning in February.  After months of preparation, we started building in June and kept going through fall and into the winter. Friends old and new stopped by to work and stay on the property. Some of us worked as carpenters professionally, others learned on the go. Over the course of build, I took thousands of photos and kept sketches, models and notes from the design process. \nSince finishing the tree houses, I\u2019ve been organizing these images, drawings and notes into a book. This book will be different than my last two photo books.  Think of it as one part instructional book, one part photo book, and one part tiny homes book. My goal is to make something that shows the process from dreaming up a seemingly outlandish idea to the final result after thousands of hours of hard work and the moments that happened in between.  I hope that the result ignites the imagination of people\u2019s inner kid and gets ideas going for their own projects.  \nTo finish the book,  I'm turning to the Kickstarter community to help raise money to complete scanning the film, to finalize the layout and send the first edition to print.  I'm working with Farm League on the production of the book. They produced films like 180 Degrees South and The Fisherman's Son and do print projects for companies like Patagonia. I'm really excited about the progress we've made and can't wait to finish it with your help. Here are some examples of the page layouts and what the front and back covers will look like. \nThe Cinder Cone Build Book will be 10 inches by 7.5 inches, about 135 pages and have a hardcover. During this campaign, the book will be $30 for a signed copy, if the campaign is successful,  the book will retail for $35.\nMaterial lists, build notes and process photos are organized into sections, like this wood burning hot tub.\nFull color and printed on matte art paper,  sections of the book document the steps and process of building large and small projects.\nIn addition to my photos, shots by Ian Durkin, Trevor Gordon, Java Hernandez and Alex Yoder will be in the book.  The majority of the photos in the book were shot on medium format film. \n Daily schedule. For more photos of the project, check out the Tumblr here.\nThe design and philosophy of building a tree house.\nTucker Gorman's (the tree houses designer) sketches from the build were scanned and included in book to show how ideas evolved.\n The building of the skate bowl. \nMan down.\nAlong with the book,  I made a video about the building of the tree houses with Farm League.  The video goes hand in hand with the story of the book.  Here it is.  Thanks for your support.\n For more on the project check out:\n@Fosterhunting (Instagram)\nThe Cinder Cone (Tumblr)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my third book and my second produced through Kickstarter.

To stay in the loop, keep in touch below:\n             Here's a very cool packing video made by one of our earliest beta product testers / touring musician Josh, showing just how much you can fit inside your Minaal bag.\nHere's an early review of the bag from another of our beta testers (and e-book participant) Dan.\nAnd another beta tester, Pete, recently decided to check his bag on a flight from Canada to Indonesia. We didn't really mention this yet, but our durable Cordura fabric and zip-away straps mean the bag can also easily handle what baggage handlers throw at it, making it truly versatile \u2013 here's Pete's experience:\nFinally, in addition to the above, we've announced our determination to stand behind the stuff we make. See our pledge here.\nStop and think for a second.\nThink about every time you've waited half an hour for your check-in luggage to show up - after wasting half an hour, and a bunch of cash, checking it in the first place! Or think of that time your luggage didn't show up... ever. \nThink about every time you've dragged a fat suitcase up stairs, across cobblestones or broken streets. \nThink about that time you wanted to stay flexible and change your flight at the last minute, but your luggage was already checked...\nPhoto via gloom\nIf you already travel carry-on only? Think about digging around at the bottom of a backpack to find your gear (it's always at the bottom).  Because of that, remember feeling the hot, judgemental breath of people bunching close behind you in security line. \nThink about being forced to check bags because your backpack was made for school kids or day trips, and you need to carry more than that. \nAnd think about poor-quality handles and zips that fail, just when you need them most.\nThink how much of your life you've lost - and will lose - to waiting. To frustration and delay. To compromise.\nThe Minaal ProTravel Carry-on Bag takes intense bag-joy in overcoming these frustrations. \n                               It's built from the ground up to:\nsave you time and money.\nmake your life easier.\nkeep you looking good. \nTo make travel more efficient. To have you ready for any situation, in any environment.\nSo you can pack - and unpack - faster.\nYou have instant access to all your gear, from any angle - not just the stuff on the top - thanks to our full-length zips.\nKeep your gadgets safe, but within easy side-access reach in the separate, secure electronics compartment. Your device is suspended in a neoprene sleeve, so no matter which way you put the bag down, your valuables won't hit the ground.\n \nRock the sleek duffel-style look by hiding the backpack straps in under 10 seconds.\n \nStrike the perfect balance between saving money & moving fast - fits inside almost all current major airline carry-on dimensions (even Ryanair!)\n  You'll have no problem being on your organisation A-game, with three card sleeves, a soft-lined phone pocket, passport pocket, pen holders, and a key clip inside an internal zip pocket.\nA seam-sealed rain cover that's easy to pull on, packs into itself and can be removed if unnecessary. It just... makes... sense.\nWe go into more detail further down the page, but quickly: \nWho are these guys with the weird accents?\n                                We're two regular guys from New Zealand who realised how dissatisfied we were with our travel gear, and thought it'd be a great idea to quit our jobs to make our own. Let's create products that make travelling faster, happier and more productive, we said. Sounds eaaaasy.\nA few years, a few more wrinkles and seven million bowls of noodles later, we're here to show you what we're packin'...\nWe know who you are.\nYou're confident stepping out the front door. You're comfortable taking those first steps along the wide open road. Maybe you live your life on that road. Maybe you have no such thing as 'home' \u2013 just momentary pauses between destinations.\nThere's one problem. Your travel gear is holding you back; it's dragging you down. And for those of us who care about travel, there's one thing we should be fighting: travel drag.\nTravel Drag = anything that slows you down, mentally or physically, from reaching your destination.\nWhether that 'drag' is... \n10 minutes wasted packing a bag that's not fit for purpose\n$30 cash thrown at airlines to check a bag\n5 minutes extra spent sorting your stuff in the security line\nnegative 5 cool points for feeling amateur because of all the straps hanging off your backpack... \nanother 20 minutes waiting at the carousel for your checked bag\n...all multiplied by however many times you do this a year....\n...the Minaal ProTravel Carry-on is here to fight all of that. \nTo make your travels faster, happier and more productive.\n(Oh, hai media professionals! We know who you are too. See our media page for resources. You can find us on facebook and twitter. You may also back our project.)\nLet's take a look at this bag.\nDon't be intimidated. The muscles are all Photoshopped.\nHigh-quality custom-molded foam feels utterly delicious against your back. Trust us. Especially when combined with the flexibility of two sets of positioning straps (waist and shoulder).\nWorks like underwear for your strap. Male underwear. Obviously.\n [EDIT: the chest strap above has been upgraded \u2013 check it out here]\nDrink holder adjusted by discreet bungee cord. Model is 5'10\" / 178cm and devilishly handsome.\nLook at that... those straps have completely disappeared. You'll be ready for any situation (including the rare, but totally real No-Straps Party).\nPullers are suitable for right-handed & left-handed people. Ambidextrous people, no dice. We don't like your type around here.\n  Other info you may be interested to know: the phone pocket is soft-lined. The cards and phone sit slightly lower than shown. There are around 4,000 species of frog known to man.\nDown on the underside of your bag, there's a tiny zip with a rain cover inside. Because it's attached to the bag by a clip, it's fast to pull on. If you don't need it, unclip it, stuff it into itself and leave it behind. Yeeeeeah.\n Tech Specs: see the up-to-date tech specs here.\nYou should use this bag if:\nYou want to travel light and move fast, but haven't found a specialist carry-on that can hold your gear, organise your digital miscellany and keep up with you. Or...\nYou travel often, and you want a carry-on that's designed with ease of use in mind; that gets out of your way & saves you time. Or...\nYou take your work on the road, but live an active lifestyle - so you need a bag that can handle the office, the street and the trail. Or...\nYou're tired of gear failing on you far too soon, so you're looking to invest in a tool with quality components - a piece of equipment that'll last. Or...\nYou have excellent taste.\nYou shouldn't use this bag if:\n\"There's nothing I enjoy more than killing time at a baggage carousel.\" \n\"I just buy the cheapest bag. They're all the same, right?\"\n\"I wish I could spend more of my life waiting in line.\"\n\"Terminator 3 is definitely the best film in the series.\"\n\nSo, why are we here?\nWhen all this started, we knew nothing. But after years discussing, sketching, investing & prototyping, we have a bag we're proud of; and more importantly, that other people have told us they need. \nSketchin'.\nWe've done our homework and tested the prototypes - both ourselves, and via others - all over the world, in wildly varied environments.\nTypical usage scenarios.\nWhile we were prototyping, it was technically possible to get to the factory in 20mins in a taxi. We preferred to take the local bus, which involved 2 hours, 1 transfer, 1 intimate 3-person moto ride,  25 minutes walking in gasping heat and humidity, 150 chickens, and a whole lot of quality time to talk gear. And it only cost 35 cents! \nEven when we took a break, we'd be the guys bringing along their bag to social occasions and making everyone talk about it. When the staff at one venue saw how we treated the bags, they organised 'special treatment' (see below) and said 'this bag is your girlfriend!'. How sadly, sadly accurate they were.\nJust to be clear with all of these stories: are we complaining? HELL NAW.\nWhile there are always tough moments, we're living the life we dreamed of, and now we need your help to take it to the next level; to reach a wider audience.\nTo achieve the minimum order quantity at the high-end factory we're working with, we're asking you to get on board.\nKickstarter = crucial funds for main production run.\nChoose your reward. \nFirstly, an important note: our Kickstarter backers come first. \nSome projects get distracted when when they get popular; if retailers call on us, we'll be flattered, but even if we're interested, we won't stock any of them until our Kickstarter order is fulfilled.\nPlease note: you can donate any amount you want to the campaign, even if you don't want any of the rewards! There's an option on the donate screen.\nYou'll be eternally cool, and if anyone says otherwise we won't believe them. If we see you in the street we promise to high-five you (no house calls). We'll also put your name in the suitably-named Epic Thank You Post on our site (not compulsory).\nYou'll receive the e-book 'Personal Guides To Efficient Travel: 25 ProTravellers Share Their Secrets'. We'll handpick 25 experienced, savvy, and notable travellers to share their tips, packing lists, stories from the road - and more! \nOf course, you also get the rewards from the previous tier: a street high-five and your name in the Epic Thank You Post.\nMade from absolute best-quality New Zealand merino wool, and enhanced with serious travel technology, these socks are the perfect accessory to accompany you on the road & keep your feet healthy. \nJust because you're awesome, we're throwing in FREE INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING on these bad boys. \nOf course, you also get the rewards from the previous tiers: a street high-five, your name in the Epic Thank You Post, and the travel e-book.\nYou'll choose one pair of the following models (yes, they're all black). Note that when pulled up, the socks rise to the lower-mid calf level of our 5'10\" / 178cm tester (i.e. just below the muscle bulge).\nSmall: US 7-11; EUR 39-44; UK 6-10 ||| King: US 12-14; EUR 45-47; UK 11-13\n  ***WHOA. All gone in less than 4 hours.***\nThere's no time to waste... the early birds are flying! We've put together a sweet special on these things for the quickest starters off the block.\nThis is strictly limited to 100 units.\nWhat's more, you still get FREE INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING.\nOf course, you also get all the rewards from the previous tiers: a street high-five, your name in the Epic Thank You Post, the travel e-book, and a pair of your choice of ProTravel Socks.\nOK, so you weren't the fastest. We won't tell anyone if you don't. And don't worry, you're getting an excellent piece of kit for a generous pre-production price (final retail price will be significantly higher).\nAnd because we're pretty cool like that, you also get FREE INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING.\nOf course, you still get all the rewards from the previous tiers (except the $199 bag special): a street high-five, your name in the Epic Thank You Post, the travel e-book, and a pair of your choice of ProTravel Socks.\nHere's where it starts getting really interesting. If you lay down $500, you're getting some serious added value on your bag purchase, in addition to everything from the previous tiers.\n1) A personalised travel wallet for carrying your passport, boarding passes, and credit cards in style. The wallet is real, high-end Italian leather, and comes with an emboss on both sides -your custom word on the front, and a smaller MINAAL on the back. As below...\nHeight: 4in / 10.4cm. Width: 7.5in / 19cm. Depth: 0.4in / 1cm\n2) Two pairs of socks of your choice, instead of one (for details of socks, see $25 tier).\n3) Added to the exclusive Minaal Beta List, at Bronze Level. The Beta List is something we've been considering and testing with a closed group for a while now. It's more than just a loyalty program (although being on the list will get you some great deals). \nIt's a way of being included in the private product development process, and the growth of the company, to get lifetime value out of your early support. While it's in early stages right now, we plan to make it an absolutely key part of our company. \nHere's the sort of benefit you can expect to see at Bronze Level:\nParticipation in prototype product testing is the cornerstone of the Beta List. You'll be included in this program, behind only Gold and Silver-level Beta Listers.\nAccess to behind-the-scenes deals, events and experiences.\nLimited-release, early notification on anything new & cool we introduce.\n4) Because we love to see the passion for product design & development spread far and wide - you get access to the digital/online version of the Minaal Product Design Workshop (as described in the $2K tier below) - a great way to learn the essentials of building and running a product business from scratch. Includes topics like:\nProduct Design 101\nProduct Conception\nMarket Validation and Research\nBasics of Finding a Manufacturer\nPrototyping & Sampling\nLong and Short-Run Production\nWe know it kinda goes without saying now, but you get all the rewards from previous levels + FREE INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING: a street high-five, your name in the Epic Thank You Post, the travel e-book, the first pair of your choice of ProTravel Socks, and a glorious ProTravel Bag.\nNow we're talking! In addition to all of the above, you're getting some awesome experiences out of this. Steve, roll the rewards...\n1) Complimentary entry into the Inaugural Minaal Product Design Workshop! \nHeld in the bustling Thai hub of Bangkok, or Vietnam's wild city of Saigon (TBD), you'll spend 2 full days learning and discussing the ins and outs of product development and design, from idea to execution - and if applicable, working intensively on your existing product ideas. You'll gain access to (that is, probably hang out and drink beers with) our network of makers, do-ers and entrepreneurs.  \nPhoto via Park Keun Hyung\nAs well as contributing to the Workshop ourselves, we'll have special guest presenter/mentor Ian Schoen, who owns and has operated a successful global product design company since 2008, with several established product lines. Ian will share his knowledge in manufacturing design, marketing and distribution, answer questions and provide valuable feedback on any product ideas you have (just as he did for us when we were starting out - brace yourself!). \nThis is an opportunity and interaction you just don't get in everyday life. We're gonna pack those 2 days full of case studies and lessons learned from experience; things like:\nHow to come up with a good product idea\nHow to validate your ideas\nHow to find the right manufacturer\nManufacturing/ Sourcing/ Samples/ Production\nThe inside word on shipping/logistics\nSelling online vs retail\nHow to integrate customer feedback into your production cycle\nHow to market your product \nBusiness vs. consumer products\nHow to develop a product as non-designer/ engineer\nYou'll need to make your own way to Bangkok/Saigon and back; once you're there, we'll take care of your accommodation and food for the 2 nights and days you're in the workshop. Of course, you're welcome to stick around and enjoy the sights and sounds of South-East Asia for as long as you like.\nYou can learn more about our product design philosophy here.\nPhoto via djrue\nEvent will be held in the first quarter of 2014. Travel details will be discussed after successful funding of the project. NB: Subject to physical readiness, visa eligibility, and other pesky but crucial legal matters. Please understand that the viability of this reward will rely on your eligibility for it - do some research if you're not sure.\nWorkshop Team.\n2) We like to build community, so you'll get yourself \u2013 and your business, if applicable \u2013 a sweet profile on the Minaal website. We'll talk about your travels and how you plan to use the gear, and probably take a photo or two. (note: this is not compulsory. We know you really work for the Feds).\n3) Added to the exclusive Minaal Beta List, at Silver Level. Just like the Bronze Level, only more exclusive. You'll be part of a tight circle getting the even more insider-er scoop on secret products, deals and experiences. You'll be ahead of everyone except the hardcore Gold members.\nYou get everything from the previous reward levels, plus FREE INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING, or you'll receive the products at the Workshop.\nHey, we just met you, and this is crazy, but OH MY GOD YOU JUST DONATED TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS.\nAlright, let's get to it - this is the big show. As well as all the Minaal products, you get:\n1) An all expenses-paid, 10-day trip to South-East Asia from wherever you are in the world, to experience what it's like to live in the tropics and make products from scratch. We'll be your personal tour guides as you see where it all began:\nWe'll start with your complimentary entry to the Minaal Product Design Workshop in Bangkok/Saigon (location TBD)\nIn Saigon, you'll get to tour at least one factory as a visitor with investor status\nWe'll experience the bright lights, business talk & chilled fresh coconuts of Saigon street life\nFinally, we'll head to the beach town of Vung Tau, for a few more nights of sipping coconuts and discussing products, business, life and how we wish so hard that Seal and Heidi Klum would get back together.\nPhoto via longo\nThe trip may be photographed and filmed and if so, the end files will be provided to you. Travel details will be discussed after successful funding of the project. NB: Subject to physical readiness, visa eligibility, and other pesky but crucial legal matters. Please understand that the viability of this reward will rely on your eligibility for it - do some research if you're not sure.\n2) You'll also be automatically added to the extreme inner section of the Beta List \u2013 the Gold Level circle, giving you the best deals, the most inside access. If you're with us for the long haul, this will provide, yeah we're gonna say it: insane lifetime value. \nYou get everything from the previous reward levels, plus FREE INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING, or you'll receive the products at the Workshop.\nWe may be biased, but that all sounds like a pretty good time.\nYou should join us.\nLooking to the future. \nIt's taken many 3am calls to discuss zips; many debates over the ideal depth of a foam cut; and many sleepless nights musing over how people really pull their laptop out in the security line, to finally reach this point.\nWe don't want to make just one bag. We want to build a long-term business that truly cares about the travel experience - and you, the committed traveller.\nWe'd be stoked if you joined us.\nThank you. And you. Aaaand you.\nBeyond the 'you know who you are' thank you to the improbable number of people who've helped in every kind of way over the years, there are a few people who produced media directly for this campaign:\nEuvie Ivanova - for press photography, and a rare ability to live off snails\nQuinn Neely - for product photography, video hustling & for single-handedly taking Uganda to the World Cup final (eventually)\nSam Flaherty - for design consultation, and wearing tearaway pants un-ironically for at least 3 years\nAnd the music used in the video:\n\"Feed The One\" by Lorenzo's Music\n\"Bust This Bust That Pt. 1 & 2\" by Professor Kliq\n\"From The Heart (feat. Richie Campbell) [Bonus Track]\" by Dengaz\nEveryone else - we wouldn't be here without you. Thanks.\nIf you want to help, please head back to the top and donate any amount you want - there's no limit or restrictions - and / or share this project with your friends.\nAlso, cheers to the media who've taken an interest:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nManufacturing - we have experience living in, and sourcing from Asia, access to professional networks, and have confirmed price and delivery ability with a vastly qualified manufacturer that produces for the world's top brands. If (when! yarrrr!) this campaign is funded, we will both be moving to live near the factory so we can personally supervise the production process. The most important thing: THE PROTOTYPES WE'VE MADE ALREADY ARE WITH THE SAME FACTORY WE'LL USE FOR THE MAIN RUN. So we know they can do it, and do it well. \n\nComplexity of order fulfilment - everyone knows that Kickstarter projects have had issues fulfilling orders on time. We've kept the reward tiers as streamlined as possible, and the tiers that will take us out of the game will occur after the production run is fulfilled. We want to match or beat our scheduled delivery date.\n\nProduct adjustments - as we continue to test and trial the bag we may need to make some small adjustments to improve the product. These will always be for the benefit of you, the user - and we'll let you know any time we improve something.\n\nCustoms - Kickstarter campaigns regularly fulfill orders worldwide without any issues, and we expect this to be the case with ours, too. However we don't pretend to have intimate customs knowledge of the entire world. We'll work hard to avoid your rewards getting held up at customs, but in the end we can't guarantee you won't experience delays or be charged. There's always a risk (just like stepping out your front door in the morning).\n\nThere will no doubt be some twists and turns in the road ahead, but with your help, we'll all arrive at our respective destinations faster, happier, and more productive.\n\nIf you'd like to donate, any amount helps - head back up to the top of the page, and look for the big green 'Back This Project' button on the right-hand side.\n\nCheers!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #30", "update_userinfo": "Bag news: we're expecting.", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "And so it begins again...", "update_content": "It\u2019s that time \u2013 but instead of joining the song in suggesting you grab a whiskey or beer (because you can\u2019t stay here), it\u2019s simply time for our final pieces of KS news and info updates; the embarrassingly emotional wrap up post will come in a couple of weeks, at the *exact* moment you\u2019re starting to quietly hope we\u2019ve forgotten about it."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #28", "update_userinfo": "Is this it?", "update_content": "One more quick note as we make sure everything's 100% cool with this project - if you haven't received your bag/socks yet, AND you haven't received a message from us - email us now: feedback [at] minaal [dot] com.\nNow working towards full closure on the project \u2013 big thanks to our Russian backers for sticking with us as we figure out the postal situation there!

Smart Bedding is all about...\n1 - Never making your bed again: There\u2019s a wonderful moment when you wake up in Smart Bedding for the first time. You'll roll out of bed, flatten your duvet, and walk away. Everyone who uses it never wants to go back.\n2 - No more messy sheets: It\u2019s something we all deal with everyday \u2013 tucking, untangling, and realigning sheets. Lets face it... traditional bedding is sh*t! Smart Bedding solves these problems.\n3 - Disrupting a stagnant industry: A third of your entire life is going to be spent in a bed. Yet, so little innovation has come to this experience. That ends here.\n4 - Function and form: Bedding shouldn\u2019t only be about how it looks. You\u2019re not just looking at it, you\u2019re sleeping in it. Does Smart Bedding look good? You betcha! But, where it really shines is in solving an age-old problem.\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nThe top sheet and the duvet cover connect together using a snap system. NOTE: you don't sleep between the duvet cover and top sheet. This ain't no sleeping bag.\n\nSumming up the problem and our solution in a single GIF. Who doesn't like GIFs? JIFs?\nLike you, we love sleeping with a top sheet. The problem is it often gets bunched at our feet, tangled, needs to be realigned, or requires being tucked in. Smart Bedding solves these problems and more.\nIn our tests, each day it takes around 90 seconds to make a bed with regular bedding. Making your bed with Smart Bedding takes less than 2 seconds. Add it all up, and you'll save over 30 days worth of time over your life!\nSnap system along the edges\nFlatten and done. No more untangling, realigning, or tucking sheets\nWake up to a perfectly made bed\nMom will be proud\nTHE STORY\nMarshall: Ever since I was a kid, I've been getting in trouble with top sheets. My mom insisted I make my bed everyday. I moved in my sleep a lot, which in turn made the top sheet a mess. It would get crumpled into a ball at my feet, or slide off the bed. When it came time to make my bed every morning, I would just lay the duvet over the mess. Mom was never fooled by the giant lump protruding from the duvet (the top sheet bunched in a ball). I'd get scolded, and remake my bed grudgingly. \nThe idea for Smart Bedding started when I got my first place. I went to all the bedding stores only to find there wasn't a solution for this. I definitely enjoyed sleeping with a top sheet, so I didn't want to get rid of it.   \nWhile living in St. Louis about a year ago, I revisited the problem. I started prototyping a bunch of different ideas for how best to solve it. I came up with a bunch on my own, but then wanted to make more substantial prototypes. I began visiting a local sewing shop on a regular basis to prototype things further with Lyn, the shop's owner.  We went through more prototypes than I can remember.\nAround the same time, Jon and I became friends. I sent him an early version to get his thoughts. The first night he was sold. The interesting bit is Jon's background \u2013 6 months prior to him and I meeting, he had never used a top sheet. It was only until his girlfriend showed him the ways of the top sheet, that he started using one, and enjoying it. Thanks Cheryl!\nJon and I decided to team up, and bring Smart Bedding to market. We've invested the last 6 months in perfecting it.  We've sought out a great manufacturer, and gone through every last detail. Now we need your help to finally make Smart Bedding a reality.  \nCOLORS\n4 colors to choose from, maybe more with stretch goals!\nYou can also mix and match colors. We'll let you choose the color for each and every piece in your set.\nWHAT YOU'LL GET\nWHY SLEEP WITH A TOP SHEET?\nIf you don't sleep with a top sheet, at best you're baffled by Smart Bedding, and at worst you're shouting blasphemy!\nWell, allow us to explain ourselves. About 50% of the US sleeps with a top sheet. Here's why you should too:\n1. It's cleaner \u2013 Without a top sheet between you and the duvet cover, you'll be washing that duvet cover a lot (a pain in the rear). By using a top sheet, you just have to wash the top sheet when it's dirty instead of the entire duvet cover. Removing the top sheet for washing is much, much easier than washing the entire duvet cover. \n2. Layers \u2013 If you get hot in the night, you can pull off the duvet and still have the top sheet to cover you. There's nothing worse than not being able to find the perfect amount of warmth for that night's temperature. The top sheet is just one more option between being covered, and not (literally and figuratively).\nJoin us.\n\nPRODUCTION PLAN\nWhen it comes to manufacturing, this isn't our first rodeo. Our manufacturing partner in Asia is lined up and ready to make these to our specs. As soon as the project ends and we've received the funds, we'll get to work. \nIt will take approximately 30 days to manufacture everyone's new Smart Bedding set. This includes everything from ordering fabric, dyeing, sewing, quality checks, and more. We'll be putting out updates along the way, so you'll get a nice inside look at the entire process.  \nThanks for reading. We hope you'll back us, and help rethink what bedding should be. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSmart Bedding is handmade, and humans are prone to errors every once in a while. We care deeply about quality, and know you do too. Because of this, there could be production delays due to quality control. We won't ship you something until it's perfect. \n\nThere could also be potential delays from our suppliers.

THANKS SO MUCH TO EVERYONE FOR BACKING THIS POSSIBLE AND MAKING THIS APP A REALITY. FOR MORE ON THE APP AND OTHER TRAVEL TIPS, BE SURE TO CHECK OUT MY SITE, NOMADICMATT.COM!!\nSTRETCH GOAL #2 - Infinity! \nWow! We hit our second funding goal!!! Awesome! Now I can make this app for both iOS and Android phones. Even though we hit our goals, don't let that discourage you from backing this project. All extra money goes back into future updates of the app. \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSTRETCH GOAL #1 - $15,000\nWow! We hit our first funding goal!!! Awesome! The next funding goal is $15,000 so we can fund for both iOS and Android! There's plenty of backing levels left to make this happen! Let's get there and get this app to everyone!! \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHello, my name is Matthew Kepnes and am the author of How to Travel the World on $50 a Day as well as run the budget travel website, Nomadic Matt. I'm here on Kickstarter to talk about my budgeting app, TripSaver. The app is already has a prototype but I'm here get your help in completing it. My advice has been featured in:\nIn 2006, I left to travel around the world. I had a limited amount of money that needed to last for eighteen months. To keep track of my money and expenses, I wrote everything down in a Moleskine notebook (I filled up two). This helped me know what I spending on but didn\u2019t let me see the big picture \u2013 was my spending too much or too little for the destination I was in? Plus, it was a pain in the butt to constantly account for currency changes and keep a running tab of eighteen months worth of expenses! \nOver the years as I\u2019ve become a leading writer on budget travel, people often say to me that they didn\u2019t know how much a place costs, whether their spending was too high, or that they ended up realizing they were spending too much money too late. In short, they found it hard to manage, keep track, and budget their money properly on the road. \nThat\u2019s a problem I can relate to. Those moleskin notebooks left a lot to be desired. \nI thought to myself \"why isn\u2019t there an app that besides letting you put in your expenses tells you if you are over or under not only YOUR budget but a suggested budget for the country based on your travel style!!??\" That way you would know if you really are overspending or if you can afford to order a few more rounds! \nPlus, it would give you a foolproof way to account for your spending and take into account currency changes! No more calculating exchange rates manually! \nThis app puts my experience and expertise in your pocket and makes tracking your spending, keeping a budget easy, saves you from carrying around notebooks or dealing with spreadsheets on a computer. \nTravel is not expensive. Seven years of traveling the world and writing about it taught me that once you break out of the hotel/vacation dynamic, a plethora of opportunities to save money happen. You can easily travel most of the world on $50 a day or less! \nBut to keep doing that, we all need to keep track of our spending so we can keep it under control and continue to travel cheaper, smarter, and longer. \nBy helping make this app a reality, you\u2019ll be able to get the best of budget travel in your pocket, whenever you need it. \nMY GOAL WITH THIS APP \nThe goal of this iPhone app is to help you keep track of your expenses, see the break down of your spending, and compare your spending to a baseline based on your travel style. \nThe app's features are: \nEnter your expenses \nSee pie and bar graphs of your spending \u2013 both daily and over time \nSee your expenses based on a suggested budget for each destination \nSet your travel style to backpacker, budget, mid-range, and luxury and your suggested spending amount will be adjusted based on that! \nE-mail your expenses to yourself, friend, or to Excel! \nSee a breakdown of all your spending based on category \n\nScreenshots of the Trip Saver app\n\n\nWHAT MAKES THIS APP AWESOME? \nThere are a lot of other apps out there but none that breaks anything down by travel type, destination, or lets you see your spending over time. That\u2019s why this app is different and awesome. Because it allows you to see the benchmark and let you know if you are spending too much money not only relative to your spending goals but also the average for the country. \nWHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?\n100% of this money will go to pay for the development of the app.\nGot questions?\nAsk me!!

We had a very specific style in mind and it took a lot of hard work, digital mock-ups, and trial and error to get exactly what we wanted.\nOne of the flaws that we discovered in a traditional wood watch was that a wood band is fragile. It doesn't matter how cool it looks if it's broken. Why not use a band that is super stylish yet is going to last? We used oil-tanned leather so that it will mold to your wrist and be more comfortable the more you wear it.\nwe searched for the highest quality leather possible\nWe searched far and wide for the highest quality leather\nWe pride ourselves on our attention to detail\nWe are offering two different case sizes, each with two different face designs.\nThe 45mm case will retail at $109.\nWe wanted to make the face a little different, so we created graphics that are a little different. (Left-Dia, Right-Tri)\nThe 52mm case BIG FACE, will retail at $130. (Left-Dia, Right-Tri)\nNext Step: \nProduction: As you can see from the pictures above, we have prototype samples on hand. These watches are the result of months of testing and design changes. We have established a relationship with a reputable manufacturer and are confident that they can produce these watches after our project ends. At the completion of a successful project we will put in an order and then each watch will be shipped out to our backers! This whole process should take 45-60 days after the close of the project.\nWhere are the funds going?\nAll pledges are going towards the first production run of our four models in two sizes.

It\u2019s cold, high, and beautiful. They'll bring compact HD video cameras to record their ascent. A third team member Joel Baud will manage their pro DSLR equipment from Base Camp. \nHelp us bring the story to you. A minimum $19 pledge will give you adigital version of the film to watch on your phone, tablet, or computer.\nThe story comes with some built-in drama. In 2012, an accident on Santa Cruz nearly killed Takeda, ending their attempt. The pair has been planning a rematch. After years of Himalayan and Andean expeditions, they\u2019re accustomed to putting their lives on the line. But this time around, the stakes are higher. The reason: Mick recently discovered he's going to be a father.\nGOAL\nWe want to create a short film exploring how an unborn child affects the trajectory of a life lived on the edge. Expedition Andes will capture Mick\u2019s deeply-conflicted personal journey set against the mighty Andes mountain range. \nFear and mortality will be weighed against the dream of the great first-ascent, revealing how humans reconcile the risks of ambition with the most precious gift in the world.\nWe have no financial support other than you the donor. We don\u2019t know what will happen in Peru, but we want to share the adventure. \nOnce again, you can help us! A minimum $19 pledge will give you a digital version of the film to watch on your phone, tablet, or computer.\nThe Andes\nBACKGROUND\nFor the intrepid, Peru has more to offer than Pisco Sours and Machu Picchu. With return of economic and social stability in the late-1990\u2019s, the Andean Cordillera Blanca became attractive for travel. It\u2019s a big deal. The Blanca offers fun-sized Himalayan climbing and trekking among grand peaks reaching almost 7000m, without the jet-lag, big budget, and major time commitment of the Himalayas or Alps. World-class surfing, mountain biking, trail-running, kayaking, paragliding and cuisine make Peru a privileged destination. Given the exceptionally stable weather, it\u2019s possible to climb almost any peak in a three-week trip, doorstep to doorstep from the US.\nLOCATION\nEncompassing almost 500,000 square miles (about the size of Alaska), Peru spans climatic zones from an arid Pacific western coastline to Amazonian jungle in the east. Between desert and rainforest lies a chain of mountains running parallel to the Pacific. This is the Cordillera Blanca. This compact sector northeast of Lima is world-class mountain terrain, boasting over a dozen 19,000 foot-plus peaks in an area 13 miles wide and 112 miles long.\nMap of Peru.\nExpedition Andes Base Camp at Laguna Yuraccocha (16,000ft) offers access to a series of peaks ranging from 18,700ft to 20,500ft.  \nThe Expedition Andes objective is the unclimbed North Face of Santa Cruz (20,534ft). We attempted this peak in summer 2012, but retreated after a near fatal accident.\nEXPEDITION ANDES: WHERE WILL THE MONEY GO?\nOnce again, this is an unsponsored trip.

Whether word-of-mouth or via Facebook, Twitter, or email, please let everyone know.\n3. Help us exceed our goal! Expedition Andes has a bare-bones budget. Expedition filming, editing, and sound mixing are very expensive. Every dollar you donate will be spent to create the best possible documentary film possible.\nNOTE: We don\u2019t get a penny unless our goal is met. We need $21,925 by our deadline or we get nothing. We have already bought plane tickets and plan to leave on June 21. The clock is ticking!\nPlease help us meet \u2013 and exceed \u2013 our goal!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe obvious risk of this project is the danger of climbing. Between us, we have 25 expeditions and decades of experience. Although this doesn\u2019t eliminate danger, it goes a long way to mitigate hazards. Rest assured, we will be as cautious as possible.\n\nA secondary challenge is capturing the action in a harsh environment to illustrate a complex story. There is no film crew other than us! But we are experienced juggling both climbing and filming.

(more in the FAQ)\nUPDATE: Final Stretch Goal reached: Free Blank Maps for everyone! (more in Update #6)\n------\nAwesome Maps are makers of, well, awesome maps! We\u2019ve come to Kickstarter to make the bucketlistmap, a map that covers all the places you\u2019ve got to see before you kick the bucket. \nBut one thing's missing: you! We want to incorporate our backer\u2019s suggestions into our awesome map, so read on to learn how to help us make maps awesome again!\nWhat maps used to be\nThis map from 1507 is one of the first world maps ever made and the first to use the name \u2018America\u2019, artfully crafted by that handsome, bearded German fellow in the corner.\nWe think this map is awesome!\n500 years later...\nWell, not so awesome anymore...\nWe're German, we've got beards, and we're making maps awesome again! \nWe\u2019ve already awesomized a few maps:\nFor our Kickstarter backers, we\u2019re doing a limited edition print of our maps, where each one will be numbered and signed by Lars!\nThe Best Part: You\u2019re Part of the team!\nMaps help us view our planet (or other planets) in new and different ways, but we also think they\u2019re a great tool for connecting people around the world. That\u2019s why we want our backers to be part of the process, suggesting and voting on which destinations make it onto the final bucketlistmap!\nWe'll collect your ideas into a list and you'll vote on the top locations and activities (exact voting method TBD)!\nWe\u2019re excited to be making a bucketlistmap that\u2019s by the crowd, for the crowd!\nWhere We Are Now\nWe want to incorporate your ideas into every continent, but we didn\u2019t want to come to you empty handed, so we\u2019ve (mostly) finished Africa!\nWe\u2019ve got lots of ideas, but we\u2019re waiting for the final piece: you!\nOur Rewards\nStretch Goals\nWe\u2019re always searching for ways to make our maps even more awesome! We\u2019ve dreamt up a few stretch goals if we surpass the minimum we need to make this map happen!\nWhy We Need Funding\nPrinting is expensive, and high quality, eco-friendly printing and packaging is even more expensive!\nWe love our planet so we try to produce as little waste as possible. So with all the packaging material we use paper instead of plastic wherever we can. All tubes, stickers etc. are custom made for our maps. \nAnd, to give you a sneak preview of what my apartment will look like for the next few months, here\u2019s a GIF of your humble bearded German cartographer packaging hundreds of surftripmaps:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019ve already successfully designed, executed, printed and shipped hundreds of surftripmaps, snowtripmaps, and footballmaps. We know what it takes, we know how long it takes, and we\u2019ve got the experience and know-how to get it done.\n\nThere are, however, some possible risks:\n\nWe get sick: This is probably the biggest risk. If something happens to me or Lars, it could be a setback. But we\u2019re typically healthy individuals, and we don\u2019t think this is a serious threat to our project. \n\nPrinting: Printing is expensive, and the printer we need is rare. Should something happen with our current printer, we have several backups. These maps will be made!\n\nFulfillment troubles: Anyone who\u2019s dealt with bulk shipments knows that fulfillment can be a less-than-awesome process. We\u2019re already partnered with a fulfillment company and have already shipped hundreds of maps to loving homes.\n\nArmageddon: It could come at any time, and we should all be prepared! Beyond probably melting our printer and burning up all our paper, Armageddon could potentially seriously revise the Earth\u2019s topology - what with evaporating oceans and raging volcanoes - necessitating a significant redesign of bucketlistmap.

We couldn't have done any of this without each and every one of you!\n!!!!!UPDATE!!!!!\nWe are thrilled to announce that Jessy Holtermann will be joining the cast of Hyperion as the lead character, Ren.\n\"I am so excited to be a part of this team. Hyperion tackles a difficult subject in a very loving and honest way. As someone who has Cystic Fibrosis, this film hits especially close to home. I am thankful to have the opportunity to help spread awareness of this disease. And I am thankful to do it with such a wonderful cast and crew.\"\nHyperion - A Film By Boman Modine\nHyperion is the story of Ren, a college senior, who is in the hospital recovering from an infection caused by her Cystic Fibrosis. A naturalist at heart, she turns to painting a Redwood forest around her hospital room when she is no longer allowed outside.\nWhen Carl visits Ren, despite the fact her family doesn\u2019t want him around, Ren tells him she doesn\u2019t want to waste away as a victim. As he struggles to do something, anything, for the woman that he loves, Carl comes to the radical conclusion that he, and his best friend Phil, can escape with Ren and travel to the Redwoods on a road trip north, fulfilling Ren\u2019s lifelong dream to the majestic trees in person.\nWhat is Cystic Fibrosis?\nCystic Fibrosis is a hereditary disease, usually developing during early childhood and affecting mainly the pancreas, respiratory system, and sweat glands. It is characterized by the production of abnormally viscous mucus by the affected glands, usually resulting in chronic respiratory infections and impaired pancreatic function.\nEva Markvoort and Cystic Fibrosis\nBoman Modine, the writer and director of Hyperion, was inspired to develop this story after watching Eva Markvoort\u2019s online videos chronicling her life with Cystic Fibrosis.\n\nWorking with the CF Community\nWe want to creatively give back to the cystic fibrosis community and ensure the accuracy of the Hyperion story. Thus, we are really lucky to be working with three amazing foundations: The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, Rock CF and the Cystic Fibrosis Lifestyle Foundation. We\u2019ve made a commitment to help these organizations to raise awareness and garner support throughout the process of making Hyperion.\nCast\nWesam Keesh as \u201cCarl\u201d\nWesam was raised most of his life in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He attended Union High School and followed up the rest of acting, theater, and film study at the University of Tulsa. He spent a summer in London at Imperial College focusing on theatre and the arts. Wesam moved to Los Angeles immediately after college to begin his professional film and television career. Some of his TV and Film work include a recurring on FOX\u2019s Touch and Indie Film Santiago which won the Silver Palm Award at Mexico\u2019s International Film Festival. He is currently a recurring character on MTV\u2019s Awkward.\nEddie Hassell as \u201cPhil\u201d\nEddie Hassell was a small town boy from Texas before he decided that his dream was to take on the big city of LA and hit the big screen. Eddie has come far in his career and has been a part of some award-winning projects. His talent not only as an actor, but as a skater has landed him promising roles and his desire to keep going has proved him ready and willing to try new things and experience the full world of acting. He starred in the award-winning film The Kids Are Alright as well as Jobs, the Steve Job\u2019s bio pic with Ashton Kutcher.\nCrew\nWriter and Director: Boman Modine\nOriginally from New York City, Boman grew up thinking he would end up being a History Professor. He picked up a camera for a few extra college credits and has been following the dream of making movies ever since.\nInstead of going back to film school, Boman taught himself Final Cut Pro and got a job working at an Apple store and eventually earned a position in the New York Film Academy\u2019s editing bay. Continuing to produce smaller projects he earned his way to LA by working for the VFX team on The Dark Knight Rises.\nHyperion will be his fourth short film. He\u2019s worked on projects for Funny or Die, the Tim and Eric Awesome Show, as well as HBO.\nBoman was inspired to write Ren\u2019s story after reading Eva Markvoort\u2019s Livejournal about living with Cystic Fibrosis:\nhttp://65redroses.livejournal.com/\nHer honesty and sincerity were, both, touching and compelled Boman to create something that would bring attention to the strength of those living with this disease.\nProducers\nStrangeway Productions\nStrangeway Productions, founded in 2010, in New York City by Boman Modine and Joe Toronto who have gone on to produce work for FunnyorDie.com, HBO and have developed the Classless pilot directed Nick Bernardone of 30Rock.\nHowever Productions\nHowever Productions, founded in 2009, in Los Angeles by Susan Posluszny after working on projects for Comedy Central and MTV.

After being introduced by a mutual friend, Hope & Scott played their first LA show together at the Room 5 in Hollywood Halloween of 2010.\nWith their unique and refreshing style of music, they\u2019re bringing a wonderful tone to our movie.\nArtwork by \u201cThomas W. Schaller\u201d\nLong been considered one of the foremost architectural artists in the world, Thomas Schaller, has won every major award for his artwork \u2013 including being a two-time recipient of the Hugh Ferriss Memorial Prize. He has authored two books ; the best-selling, and AIA award of merit winner, Architecture in Watercolor, and The Art of Architectural Drawing. He is increasingly in demand internationally to conduct his watercolor workshop series, \u201cThe Architecture of Light\u201d.\nHe\u2019s contributing his talent to both provide artwork that will appear in the movie as well as a wonderful, and original, piece that will be our poster.\nWhy Donate? And Why Kickstarter?\nIn fundraising for this film, we wanted to spread the word about Cystic Fibrosis. With Hyperion, it\u2019s not only about making a film, it\u2019s about creating art that enlightens and engages people. For that we need a community, we need you, and your support to make this film into a reality.\nMay is Cystic Fibrosis Awareness month. We wanted to introduce ourselves to the community that\u2019s out there and spread the word that a project like this is being done. By going with Kickstarter we have a platform to do this amongst goodhearted people who believe, along with us, that Ren\u2019s story should be told.\nWhere Your Donations Go\nOne of the things we love about this format of crowed-funding is that you\u2019ll get to see where exactly your contributions will go.\nPanavision Prep: We have received the Panavision Grant to use their cameras and equipment but they require a preparation day which still costs a significant amount. This is our first and most important goal to reach so we can use the best film camera system in the world!\nProduction Insurance: This will be important for the safety of our cast and crew. And it\u2019s also required by law\nAdditional Equipment: While the majority of what we need we hope to have donated, we do need some special items including a rig for filming the car scenes on the road trip, specialized medical equipment for the hospital and a generator for shooting at night.\nLocations and Travel: We\u2019ll be making this movie largely on the move. While we wanted to shoot this in Los Angeles it is, quite frankly, too expensive and so we\u2019ve moved to the outer cities in the region. This is cheaper, but still has costs: transporting and feeding even a small cast and crew gets expensive when you consider hotels, vehicles and how much a key grip can eat in a day. It\u2019s important to us that we get authentic locations for the film and these are pricey. We save a lot by leaving LA (where hospital sets can easily run as much as $10,000 per day) but need your help to keep everyone safe and happy.\nPost Production: The all-important editing process where we take what we\u2019ve done, cut it into a thousand pieces, then tape it back together. This process is long, arduous, but it\u2019s where the movie comes to life.\nFilm Festival submission fees: Self-explanatory- these are the gatekeepers to bringing the movie off the Youtube/Vimeo channels and onto the Silver Screen near you. Each film festival submission costs between $40 \u2013 $100 dollars.\nREWARDS!!\nWe\u2019ve been really fortunate to be helped by so many different people and organizations in the development of Hyperion.\nAMAZING ROCK CF T-SHIRT/HYPERION FILM T-SHIRT:\nYour choice between the following designs, including the exclusive red and white \u201cRedwoods\u201d color scheme:\nTHOMAS W.

Hank is an aging man whose solitary life and routine in the mountains he calls home are no longer hospitable to his mind and his body. His declining health and a changing ginseng trade, accompanied by something supernatural in his woods, coincide to signal a transformation in Hank's life.\nHank has spent his entire life in the tattered home in which he was born. His home, which is his world, has always been a place of solitude and repetition. In Harvest, we watch Hank as he maneuvers through his daily activities, routine hardened by years of practice. He splits wood for the coming winter, he prepares a fence around his land, and he forages the surrounding mountains for ginseng.\nGinseng root, widely popular for its healing and energizing qualities, has always been a means to an end for Hank. At $500 a pound, it gave him what little money he needed to get by, money he needed to buy groceries and provisions from the small gas and grocery owner, Brenda. Ginseng also connected him with local horticulturalist Tony Baldwin, whose friendship along with Brenda\u2019s were Hank\u2019s only connections to life outside the mountains.\nLittle by little, Hank\u2019s routines and customs start to deteriorate. The ginseng trade that he depends on and that has always been consistent is beginning to change. Tony is getting out of the business; Hank\u2019s new dealer, Bernard Ferguson, is an outsider with a different process. And the ginseng-laden mountains that Hank has known so well all these years start to fail him. To add to his uneasiness, he starts to see and hear something unfamiliar lurking around him, something seemingly not of this world. Perhaps spirits of the forest, perhaps spirits from his past. \nHank starts to falter under the increasing pressure of providing ginseng that he simply can't find. We watch as the man, defined by the routine of years past, slowly comes apart.\nThe Why\nThis film is important for several reasons:\n1.) Hank's story is certainly timely. It is about a lifestyle that is becoming increasingly scarce. In a world where interconnectivity has disrupted the localization of life and spirit.\n2.) Harvest explores a time in life that we all will encounter. The moment where we realize we are not the person we used to be. The world that once was our playground suddenly has a foreignness. Hank has been defined by his day to day actions. And, this film implores us to watch, in length, as he struggles to keep going.\n3.) This film will be made in the style of Slow Cinema. The technique of this film is imperative for the future of media. In a modern age where we have become engrained with fast, economic, and efficient storytelling, this film decidedly slows the pace. Instead of using highly manufactured plot to tell the viewer what to think, Harvest gives the viewer space and time to think for themselves. The film becomes the ultimate interactive medium. It gives us space to make our own personal connections. It is a hint at a story and a life that we are all familiar with, in a world that many of us may not be familiar with. The technique of this film is a purely cinematic. It uses time and space, explored in depth, to tell a story of transformation.\nThe Back Story\nHere are a series of blog posts that describe the journey we have already made to make this film:\nHarvest Series, I, II, III\nThe above stills are from a location scout in 2012. This is the new Hank Colby, the replacement for my friend, Paul. Choreographer, director, and actor John Gamble. Because of John's long career studying and performing human movement he is the perfect fit for this film. The film does not tell us about Hank through story or through dialogue but through the way he carries himself in the dark, dusty interiors of his home. Through the way he does his day to day routine, and ultimately through the way he begins to falter. Movement and space are the voice for this character and there is no better artist than John Gamble for the job.\nThe Production\nThis is why we have Kickstarter. Making a film is an expensive enterprise. This film will not be made for $15,000. But, through my own personal investment and outside investors who have already committed this is the number we know we still need to make the production happen. In other words, this is the final piece. $15,000 stands between us and completion.\nThis film is highly reliant on the visuals and as such we have decided to shoot on the RED Epic. This camera and all the support that it requires will make up a big part of our budget. But, it is well worth it, dare I say essential. With our talented Director of Photography (Seamus Mulligan-Ferry) at the helm and with a clear vision of our final product we can be certain that this investment will result in a stunning piece of visual artistry. Your donations, towards the goal of $15,000, will help us achieve this.\n\nThe People\nThere have already been many instrumental people involved. But, here are the key creative players:\nJohn Gamble (Hank Colby):  John Gamble, Professor of Dance, is a dancer, choreographer, designer, and the director of the John Gamble Dance Theater. Among his mentors are Anna Halprin, Daniel Nagrin, and Erika Thimey. He was department chair of dance at Temple University 1975-1985. He taught at University of North Carolina at Greensboro since 1985, where he was department head from 1985-1993. His choreographed works have been presented throughout the United States and in Canada, France, and Germany. In addition to his formal choreography, he teaches and performs contact and other improvisational forms. He is a recipient of a North Carolina Arts Council Choreographic Fellowship and was awarded the NC Board of Governor's Teaching Excellence Award in 2006 and the NC Dance Alliance Annual Award in 2007. \nCurrently, John is retired from his position at UNC-G. He continues to produce work, but on a cold winter night in downtown Winston-Salem, when I saw him sitting on a bench smoking a Marlboro, I thought to myself, \"This is Hank!\"\nLuckily I was able to track him down and even more luckily we shared artistic sensibilities. We both felt he would be the perfect person for this role characterized by movement and physicality. \nMike Paulucci (Producer):\nMike Paulucci graduated from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro with an M.F.A. in Film Production in 2011. His short films have screened at a number of festivals around the country, and his first feature Tasmanian Tiger is currently in post-production.\nAlong with creating independent films, Mike is a Digital Media Designer at the Erikson Institute in downtown Chicago, revolutionizing the way early childhood is taught to working professionals with an end result to better the lives of children and their families. His work at Erikson was shown at the World Forum on Early Care and Education in Honolulu, HI.\nSeamus Mulligan-Ferry (Director of Photography): With a keen interest in both films and photography, Seamus Mulligan-Ferry was naturally drawn to the creative and technical hybrid of cinematography. After determining he wanted a solid artistic foundation, he received his MFA from the University of North Carolina-Greensboro, where he gained vast experience shooting his peers\u2019 films and honed his aesthetic sensibilities.\n\nAfter relocating to New York City and a two-year stint managing the camera department at a rental house, Seamus began freelancing full-time to pursue his ultimate goal of shooting narrative features. Drawing inspiration from such cinematographers as Conrad Hall, Harris Savides and Robert Richardson, Seamus strives to compliment the emotional tone of a project through a subtle approach to lighting and composition.\nSeamus recently completed lensing his first feature film last summer; Harvest producer Mike Paulucci\u2019s Tasmanian Tiger. The film was a welcome chance for him to explore the visual boundaries of genre conventions while helping to convey the evolution of the film\u2019s protagonist.\n\nWith Harvest, Seamus and director Cagney Gentry have already started to develop a strong visual approach for the project and he is eagerly awaiting the opportunity this fall to help bring the Harvest script to the screen.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIn writing this film I tried to conceptualize a piece that was conducive to micro-budget filmmaking. What story, what concept, what passion did I have that could be told in mostly one location, with one main character, and with a simplicity of technique. With that framework I decided to explore a life of solitude and the subsequent consequences of its disruption.\n\nEven though I have optimized the feasibility of making this film, making a feature is always challenging. It is always wrought with risk. Here are a few challenges specific to this production:\n\n1.) Besides Hank, the other role that sees the most screen time is his dog. We will have to hire a dog and trainer to be onset for a large portion of the shooting schedule. Working with animals is quite a challenge and the success of fundraising will ensure we minimize the risk by hiring talent and experience. The main way we are combatting this risk is by scheduling extra time, from the beginning, for the dog and trainer.\n\n2.) The style of this film demands very long takes that require lots of planning, rehearsal, and then re-shooting in full when mistakes happen. This means that the schedule is always at risk of being delayed. We will do our very best to make this not happen. What we have going for us is time. I already have my lead actor and we have been and will continue to be working through every scene in detail. This preparation time before the shoot should ensure that the shoot goes along as close to schedule as possible.\n\n3.) We will be WAY out in the middle of no where. We have both the location and a basecamp nearby where cast and crew can stay. But, we will also need additional lodging and food. This will be challenging in a remote area, but we did identify a location that is secluded yet still not too far from a small town. We will hire one person whose job it is to run back and forth from town for supplies.\n\n4.) Anything and everything can go wrong in a film production. We are taking the necessary steps to be prepared for this generic threat. We will combat this by scheduling extra time, adding more days to the schedule than we think we will need. In addition to extra time, extra hands on set can be essential. One person who is ready to tackle any situation but not already tied to a department can be an indispensable asset.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #5", "update_userinfo": "Link and Nearing the End", "update_content": "Over the past several months I have had the pleasure of seeing some of you.

But this simple act can have such a profound effect on us all, as well as our planet.\n\nHi! My name is Alex Eaves and I live a \u201creuse life.\u201d Ever since I was a little kid, reusing has been a part of my life; from turning toilet paper rolls into matchbox car tunnels to using old refrigerators for skateboarding obstacles. But what really sparked my passion for reuse was the mass production of new \u201cstuff\u201d that I saw during my years of selling merchandise for bands around the world. And when I saw a lot of the unsold items being destroyed without ever having been used once, that was the real catalyst to lead a reuse life. \nAlex Eaves with some very early reusing of paper bags and paper towel rolls.\nIf I wanted to create widespread change though, I knew that I had to do something beyond just incorporating reuse into my own life. I needed to educate and offer ideas and solutions to encourage people to take their own small steps. So, in 2008, I took my first step and converted my apparel brand, STAY VOCAL, into a strictly reuse apparel brand. Instead of printing on new garments, we rescue T-Shirts and give them a second life. Just a few months after the conversion, I won a best small business idea award for SV and we\u2019ve been finalists for Green America business awards in 2009, 2010 and 2013. \nAlex Eaves speaking about STAY VOCAL and reuse at an Earth Day event in Berkeley, CA\nAs a result of running a business that reuses every step of the way, reusing has become a way of life for me. From how I shop to how I dress to how I give gifts, reusing is always at the forefront. And what I've learned is that reuse is the ultimate win-win-win: the benefits are for people, planet, AND your wallet. Plus, it can be pretty fun! For example, whenever you buy a STAY VOCAL T-Shirt, you\u2019re not just getting a cool T-Shirt featuring a unique design at a great price. You\u2019re also helping save 400 gallons of water; the amount it takes to grow the cotton for 1 T-Shirt! So, just by putting that shirt on, you\u2019re creating instant positive change for the planet. And it doesn\u2019t just stop there. I\u2019ve heard from customers time and time again at how amazing the SV reuse shirts are as conversation starters. \n\nTHE FILM\nThe benefits of reusing instead of buying new or recycling are significant and many of us see them; we just need more people to see them. And if there's one thing I've learned over the years of doing events around the country for STAY VOCAL, it's that getting out, talking to people and sharing reuse ideas is the most effective tactic. That\u2019s what this project is all about.\nAfter being a finalist for Green America's People & Planet Award this past February, I decided that I would hit the road for a second nationwide tour to share how STAY VOCAL is reusing. (In 2010, I did the STAY VOCAL \"ReUse & Schmooze\" Tour with singer/songwriter Dandelion Snow). In addition to showcasing STAY VOCAL, I would seek out other people who are reusing in unique ways, as this country is full of people with great ideas about reusing.  But after working with a team to plan my tour, it became obvious that these ideas needed to be shared on a larger scale. Thus, the idea for a documentary was born.\nThe documentary will be a compilation of a nationwide tour with stops in all 48 contiguous states. In each state, I'll visit with people and organizations who are reusing in original ways. By documenting this experience, I'll not only broaden the awareness and benefits of reuse in everyday life, but also provide a unique edutainment experience by seeing how people all over the country are reusing in different ways; many of which we could easily incorporate into our own lives, many of which help save money, and many of which are fun!\nThe San Diego stop of STAY VOCAL's Reuse & Schmooze Tour\nIn addition, I\u2019ll be visiting various events and shops along the way to showcase how STAY VOCAL is reusing through its apparel, shipping, and everyday business methods.

Now accepting pre-orders here: rskt.ch/presketch\n\"...inspiring, layered and high quality crafted sketch books.\" - Forbes\n\"A sketchbook comprised of random, high-quality reused paper\u2026\" - Jason Fried\n\"Important!\" - Harper Reed\n\"I've got one and it's all I've been using for weeks.\" - Max Temkin\n\"Every few pages, discover something new.\" - Nick D.\nResketch isn't the same old, boring sketchbook you're used to. The mission is simple...\nProvide a new take on the fundamental building block of creative thinking: a sketchbook that fosters creativity and discovery via a diverse selection of paper types, and simple yet thought-provoking Creative Prompts.\nAcquire interesting, high-quality reused paper from a variety of non-new sources that would otherwise be destined for a landfill or recycling center\nPost-Kickstarter, find innovative ways to get Resketch books to people who need them most.\nThe Resketch books I'll make for this Kickstarter are 7 x 9-inch, between 85-100 pages, and coil-bound with a thick chipboard cover and back.\nIf this Kickstarter project is successful, I'll know this idea is viable, and I'll be able to produce 1000 total books: 700 standard Resketch books for the $25 backer level, and 300 special-edition Resketch books described below at the $50 level (that includes domestic shipping for each level, by the way).\nThe funds will be used to find awesome, forgotten paper sitting in warehouses, offices, and recycling bins that is otherwise perfect to use, cutting and sorting equipment, letterpress-print the covers, gather the various components, pay for the production of the final Resketch books, and, of course, pay the artists involved. Oh, and the dreaded postage. Funds cover that, too, which is about $6500 for 1000 books!\nIf we can hit $50,000, I will provide something new and entirely free-of-charge that speaks to the spirit of Resketch: Access to all of the Creative Prompts!\nOpen-ended, straight-forward, and incredibly fun...\nIf we hit this total, ALL previous backers (if you chose an award) will receive a separate, coil-bond volume of the Creative Prompts! That\u2019s all 100 Prompts -- 25 from each of the 4 categories, available in a volume. Normally about 10 of these would be inside each Resketch book, randomly inserted, different from one book to the next. However, this way you can experience ALL of them in one place. Note: Your Resketch book will still have random prompts inside, too.\nKeep in mind: This is for Kickstarter ONLY and I\u2019ll never release them like this again.\nI hope you like this stretch offer, and if so, please continue to spread the word about Resketch. The higher we go, the more I\u2019d love to do with prompts, interesting paper stock, the expansion of the educational components of Resketch, and much more.\nSpecial-edition artist covers\nUPDATE! There have been a number of requests for a new level now that the original Artist Cover level has been depleted. However, those early backers are awesome and special, so I don\u2019t want to make them feel bad. In fact, I want to make them feel GOOD! I think this is a good solution, though I welcome your feedback.\nThe new $65 Backer Level consists of the following:\nLaser-engraved covers from new artists! It\u2019s not printed per say, but it\u2019s essentially \u201cone-color\u201d and looks super awesome (check the example photo below for the look and feel of it)\nThe artists? Art Baltazar, Andrew Bell, Chris Ryniak, Mig Reyes, and myself\n30 of each cover will be printed, signed and numbered by the artists, so 150 of these are available.\nLASERS!\n\"Huh? More expensive?\" you ask. It's true. Two things: The early backers are awesome. You're awesome, too, but they get something special for being earlier than you. Kickstarter, am I right? Second, laser-engraving like this takes FOREVER, especially on a 7 x 9-inch cover.\nSTRETCH-ISH THING BELOW...\nThis is the cool part \u2013 NEW BACK cover design \u2013 designed by myself, inspired by Resketch. This new back cover will be printed and on ALL special-edition Resketch books (so that includes the $50 level automatically). Sorry, not the regular-edition, folks.\nFinally, I also added a couple of Resketch book packs. These packs are for the regular edition, not the special edition. Now you can get either a 3- or 5-pack of Resketch books if you want a few, or have a smaller educational group you need them for. Hope this makes it easier for everyone! Thanks again for your support!\nWhile the standard Resketch book is a thing of beauty, I didn't want it to end there. Especially for this Kickstarter, I've enlisted the help of some amazing artists from around the US and Chicago to create art for a limited-edition series of Resketch book covers (30 of each cover, signed and numbered \u2013 so 300 total) at the $50 level, all lovingly screen-printed by Jay Ryan and the friendly folks at The Bird Machine. The artists...\nSorry, this level is all gone...\nNORTH AMERICA:\nTara McPherson - Brooklyn, NY\nScott C. - New York\nJon Burgerman - New York via UK\nCamilla d'Errico - Vancouver, Canada\nCHICAGO:\nJay Ryan\nMatthew Hoffman\nLaura Berger\nblUtt\nRevise CMW\nShawn Smith\nKeep in mind these are first-come, first-served. It's a bit tricky since that's not built into Kickstarter, but we'll keep you updated as the project progresses, and promise to come up with a sensible solution. Backers: We'll be in touch about your artist cover choice.\n\nThe whole is greater than the sum of its parts\nResketch books are made of a bunch of different kinds of interesting paper, each of which providing a different experience. One page is standard white copy paper, the next is thick, textured, gray paper, then sticker paper. Then an odd pattern, or a piece of a map, all interspersed with Prompts. From one page to the next, and from one book to the next, it's never the same experience. This sense of discovery is exactly what I love about it.\nReused paper sourced from a variety of places in Chicago.\nEverything will then be put together in a 7 by 9-inch format, and spiral bound with an eco-friendly, black, plastic spiral coil. The binding is on the side, so the book will sit nicely on your shelf once filled. The spiral binding also has an added benefit: The Resketch book will sit nice and flat as you work on it.\nSource, collate, trim, punch, and coil-bind. Repeat...\nNote: the final regular-edition book covers will be letterpress-printed.\nCreativity is the answer\nFinding inspiration isn't always easy. In fact, it can be downright elusive. Resketch isn't going to solve all of your creative blocks, but it may just help get things moving. Whether it's the fun Creative Prompts or simply the variety of paper types, I want Resketch books to act as a springboard for your ideas.\nThe numbered Creative Prompts are randomly inserted every so often \u2013 around 10 per book \u2013 and are meant to inspire subtly, nudge you visually, or at least make you laugh. They're either printed on reused paper on hand or on 100% post-consumer waste, eco-friendly paper using vegetable-based ink. Since they're randomly inserted, you'll likely get a different set of Prompts with each Resketch book. Collect them all!\nJust a few of the Creative Prompts...\nThey'll be printed in a light-to-medium gray so you can draw on top of them with ease, or, if you don't feel like a prompt, use the page however you'd like. It's entirely up to you!\nThe prompts are broken up into four categories: Building Character gives you a character or characters of some sort to interact with. Visually-minded gives you some visual cue to draw from. Wordplay is just that \u2013 how do words help you creatively? And finally Inside Out asks working artists, designers and creative people how they think about creativity, what helps them, what they use, etc. Think of this section as inspirational quotes, except relevant and not at all cheesy.\nEco-friendly by nature\nI'm not an ardent environmentalist, but we now live in a time when thinking about issues of reusing and recycling isn't an exception to our daily life, it's the rule. As such, I wanted to make sure Resketch isn't adding to waste by using new paper stock \u2013 especially in the already crowded sketchbook space.\nPaper: Reused, interesting, otherwise wasted\nPaperboard: Recycled, 100% post-consumer waste, hearty so it'll last\nEco-coil\u2122: Recycled, 100% post-consumer waste. Yes, it's plastic, but it's more durable, and can be recycled again.\nCreative Prompts: Printed on 100% recycled or reused paper using vegetable-based inks\nAnd that's it. I believe in drawing, I believe in Resketch, and I hope you do, too. If you're into it, please back it and tell a friend. Thanks for reading!\nLet's turn reused paper into something awesome.\nAcknowledgements\nWith any project that involves so many facets, it absolutely takes a village.

I miss you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've been developing Resketch for the last 5 years, so I don't expect any significant setbacks now that things are officially under way. However, these books involve many components and a fair deal of production to get exactly right (sourcing reused paper, collating, cutting, printing, binding, etc). As such, I want to be smart about how this will all play out. That said, potential risks and challenges are as follows:\n\nOVER-FUNDED = SOURCING ISSUES\nIf the project is significantly over-funded, there is a chance of slight delays in sourcing additional reused paper stock. Since I already have significant amount of paper on hand, and am establishing partnerships / accruing more all of the time, I don't foresee this is a big issue. We almost have enough paper to handle the initial run of books for our goal (700 regular books + 300 artist books). If we go above and beyond our funding goal, of course, that means more and more books. In short, this would be a good problem to have, and easily solved.\n\nPRODUCTION DELAYS\nI've already started working with an amazing company here in Chicago to put the Resketch books together, but there are a lot of steps that go into Resketch to get it right. As such, there's always the possibility of delays related to physically making the books (especially if the project is over-funded).\n\nARTIST COVER PRINTING DELAYS\nThe special edition books will be screen-printed by the one and only Bird Machine. While I expect no delays whatsoever, delays could happen if there was some sort of snag with printing, or one of the artists had some sort of unforeseeable delay in getting us final art. Should this happen, I would do my absolute best to quickly figure out a solution, but this is a remote challenge.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #30", "update_userinfo": "My new project: Resketch Note", "update_content": "Hello Resketch backer,\nI'm sending this to a few spots, so apologies in advance if this message comes in more than once!\nWhile some of you may know this, others may not: My Resketch project continues to grow with custom books for companies big and small!

Thank you all so much for your support.  We are incredibly excited to say that for a limited time, we will be taking pre-orders through our website, which will be opening soon.\nWhat is Plume?\nPlume is a streamlined, recoiling mudguard which complements the look of your bike. Plume looks as good when it's protecting your back from muddy street water as it does when it\u2019s coiled away.\nWhat's so special about Plume?\nPlume extends out into a sleek fender or recoils back into a tight circle under your seat with the gentle press of a finger, even if you\u2019re in motion. To top it off, Plume uses resilient, street-tough materials (stainless steel and a flexible polymer) so you can trust it to stand up to some nasty conditions.\nWell that's pretty fantastic.  But what's wrong with normal mudguards?\nFor some reason, there are a lot of unattractive, poorly made, easy to break or steal fenders out there. In fact, some people have taken to fashioning home-made mudguards from plastic bottles or cardboard in protest.\nWhen you\u2019re riding on a wet street, Plume acts as a barrier\nbetween the muddy, chemical-laden water and your clothing. It\nalso looks damn fine while doing so. When the sun comes out, simply reach back with one hand and press down on the Plume to make it recoil into a minimal circle under your seat.\nI'm sold, but if you had to provide two more details about Plume that would make me extra happy, what would they be?\nPlume was designed to be difficult to steal. Its stainless-steel spine wraps around your bicycle's seat post. Plume also attaches to a wide variety of seat post sizes, which makes installation easy, and removes the need for extra clumsy shims or spacers.\n-------------------------------------\nPlume is a project that has been in the works for a long time, since Patrick and Dan met in London four years ago. Both designers ride their bikes everywhere.  \nLondon's reputation for rain is dead on \u2013 it's not an exaggeration.  If anything, it rains more than Hollywood would have us believe.  Naturally, Plume was born out of a desire for a better mudguard.\nAs we worked on it, the demand for a product like this became more and more apparent. Ultimately, we realized that Plume could be big, and that the best way for two idealistic designers to get the word out was Kickstarter.\nWe have produced several prototypes of Plume and have a chain of manufacturers who are feeling just as good about this project as we are.  If we raise $18,000 we will be able to pay for tooling and production costs for the very first production run of Plume.  If things go bananas, we will be able to afford fancier tooling which will cost more initially, but will allow us to produce Plume much more efficiently, potentially getting us geared up for distribution to bike shops around the world!\nWe're super excited by the prospect of getting to share this process with the Kickstarter community. We feel like children on Christmas morning when we get the opportunity to hang out with our manufacturers and play with their machines. So throughout the production process, we\u2019ll be taking all of our supporters on a virtual field trip. Factory visits, insight into our design process (it can be very messy) and frequent updates, all in an effort to honor Kickstarter's gap-bridging manifesto, and to ignite conversation with like-minded people around the world.\nThe rewards!\nWe've got a bunch of exciting rewards for you guys.  We've done our best to keep them as affordable as possible.  For the benefit of everyone, we will ask you to pay for your individual shipping costs based on your address at the time of fulfillment.  Allow us to break it down for you.\nKARMA POINTS:\nWe've been there.  You like an idea and want to show it some love, but maybe can't afford to shell out right now.  Don't worry, if you scratch our back, Karma will scratch yours.\nREFLECTIVE STICKERS:\nIf it were up to us, everything would be reflective.  Let's take one step at a time though. The pack consists of six circular reflective stickers.  This is the same high quality reflective material used on the Plume Mudguards, as well as police cars and ambulances around the world.\nTURBO BOOST:\nTurbo Boost in action\nTurbo boost is a nitroglycerin-powered accelerator which can be easily mounted to the rear of your bicycle.  The Turbo Boost pack includes two canisters of our secret nitro formula, a base plate, and a mounting strap constructed from an elastomeric polymer band.  Illustrated instructions are also included.  (Written irony is tricky.  In case it wasn't obvious, the Turbo Boost is basically two confetti poppers and a laser-cut base plate, and a rubber band.  But it works surprisingly well.)\nPLUME:\n$35 gets you your very own Plume mudguard.  You'll be the talk of the town.  Your Plume will have been made by British factories, it will probably have been raining outside while they were made, and there's a certain irresistible poetry there.  If funding is successful, we should be able to get Plume into your hands for Autumn.\nPARTY TIME:\nWe are going to be throwing a major fiesta if we successfully fund this project.  Actually, we'll be throwing two.  One will be held in London, the other in New York City.  As a backer at this tier, you will not only have helped make our dreams come true, you also get TWO tickets to our celebration.  Of course, you will also get a Plume when they are ready.  We're pulling out all the stops on this because A) we love parties, and B) we love you.  We're talking open bar and carnival games kind-of love.\nMEGA PARTY TIME PACK:\nWoah- this one is mega.  At this level, you get a ticket for you and a friend to our party (again, we're throwing one in London and another in NYC, so it's up to you which you attend).  You also get a Plume as soon as they come off the production line.  But as a backer at the Mega Party Time Pack level, you also get the Turbo Boost, the Reflective Sticker Pack, AND a hand screen printed Tee Shirt!\nYou're going to look really good in our hand printed tee. Then you're going to get it covered in bike grease. But before long, you'll notice everyone else smearing their t-shirts in bike grease too. Soon, high-street shops are selling pre-greased t-shirts for hundreds of dollars. Have you always been such a trend setter?\nGOLDEN PLUME:\nThis one's for people who really like the idea of Plume, have a taste for extravagance, really want to help us, but maybe don't have a need for 30 mudguards.  For $1,000 you get a very special edition GOLD PLATED PLUME!  We can't promise it will work, and riding around in the elements will most likely ruin the gold plating.  But who uses their silver cutlery anyway?", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProducing a physical product is always a challenge. Obstacles can crop up from anywhere. Between the highly accurate tooling required, choices in material composition, finding just the right balance of heat, time, and pressure for bonding to occur, shipping between multiple factories, and human error, it is a miracle that anything gets produced on time. To add to this, Plume is made from material combinations and unique components which haven't been executed in many other products before. We have spent a lot of time finding manufacturers willing to take on a job which is somewhat risky when compared to every-day run of the mill type work. Plume may look simple, but there is a lot going on under the hood.\n\nThat said, we are working very closely with manufacturers and material suppliers based in the United Kingdom. This gives us a level of communication and flexibility which we would not have if we were producing Plume overseas. We have already successfully locked down an effective and proven flow of production, and have been investigating processes which could produce the same product even more efficiently.\n\nWe are experienced and well versed in the manufacturing and production of physical products. Having spent years working through the kinks and potential hiccups which Plume could throw our way, we are now at a stage where we are confident that Plume will deliver.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #24", "update_userinfo": "Designs of The Year Award VOTE OUT", "update_content": "Hey everyone!\nToday is a big day for us, it's the online social vote between the Plume Mudguard and the GoPro Camera on the Designs of The Year Award website. \nNow this is not an easy choice for many to make.

Head over to http://tryghost.org for more information.\nWhat People Are Saying About Ghost\nForbes - \"If Mr. O\u2019Nolan and Ghost deliver on their big idea that is now a funded project, content innovation may return to the forefront of disruptive conversation.\" \nWired - \"Ghost aims to reboot blogging ... a combination of user-focused design, open-source code & non-profit company\"\nTechCrunch - \"Ghost will take your boring blog to the next astral plane ... it looks so darn beautiful.\"\nMashable - \"Is This Kickstarter Project the Future of Blogging?\" \nProBlogger - \"a simply, elegantly designed and useful interface ... I\u2019m really excited to see this developed\"\nIgnite100, Europe's \u00a31 million startup accelerator programme - \"Awesome work.\"\nAGBeat - \"first exciting thing to happen to blogging in years\"\nWhat do You Have to Say About The World?\nGhost is a platform dedicated to one thing: Publishing. It's beautifully designed, completely customiseable and completely Open Source. Ghost allows you to write and publish your own blog, giving you the tools to make it easy and even (gasp) fun to do. It's simple, elegant, and designed so that you can spend less time messing with making your blog work - and more time blogging.\nWriting for The Web. Done Right.\nGhost has a smart writing screen. Markdown on the left, and a live preview on the right. Write down your ideas and format them on the fly, never pausing to click on endless formatting buttons, never having to write long/painful HTML to express your ideas. You can even theme the preview pane to match your blog's formatting exactly.\nA Dashboard That Makes Sense\nGhost grabs all the important data about your blog and pulls it into one place, so you can see it all together. No more clicking through tens of browser tabs to view your traffic, social media subscriptions, content performance or news feeds. Drag and drop the widgets most important to you into your own custom dashboard, and stay on top of your blog's performance.\nSimple Content Management\nGhost does something ridiculously simple when it comes to your content. It lets you browse and preview you all your stuff within a single view, just like you're already used to with your email. Save time, save energy, browse and manage your content without over-click syndrome.\nReady for Sharing and Search\nGhost comes ready to connect to your social media services right out of the box. No endless plugins required to do stuff that everyone with a blog wants to do. Connect your blog to publish to your Twitter and Facebook accounts, rank properly in search engines, and much more.\nCustomise it Completely\nGhost is Open Source, and it's all yours. You can write themes for it so your blog can have its own design. You can write plugins for it to add your own functionality. You can host it on your laptop, or you can host it on a public server. The code is open, and so is the MIT license. No restrictions.\nWe're incredibly proud to announce that WooThemes have backed us at the partner level and will be creating themes for Ghost.\n\"WooThemes wanted to support Ghost and see it become a reality, because we want our users to experience the same awesomeness. As such, we'll be working closely with the Ghost team to get some of our themes Ghost-ready\" - Adii Pienaar\nNot Just for Solo Bloggers\nThe first version of Ghost is focused on small blogs, but Ghost was born out of many frustrations. One of those was managing online newsrooms. Want to build the next Mashable? We're building Ghost to scale with features that allow news sites and magazines to manage editors and authors and content in a way that makes sense.\nMobile Friendly\nInspiration can strike anywhere, not just when you're sitting behind a computer. So, Ghost works where you work. Ghost is a fully responsive web application that works on all devices. Not just moderating comments or token functionality. The whole thing.\nMade for Love, not for Profit\nGhost is a non-profit project. If successfully funded, Ghost will be legally registered as a not-for-profit organisation. Why should you care? It means that no one owns shares of monetary value in the project. We're building Ghost because we want online publishing to be better. We want to make decisions focused on that goal, not on building a startup that we can sell to Facebook for $1billion. \nBeing a non-profit means that any money Ghost makes can only ever be used to re-invest in making Ghost better. Not making shareholders rich.\nUse Ghost in The Cloud + Help us Grow\nThis Kickstarter project is all about building Ghost v1.0 and delivering it to our backers - but we don't just want to stop there. The majority of the problems which exist with self-hosted blogs, exist due to complications with hosting. That's something we want to solve.\nWe're setting up world-class hosted platform that allows you to set up a new Ghost blog in just a couple of clicks \nYou'll need hosting for your blog no matter what, but our service will be the most powerful way of running Ghost - and the easiest to get started with. You'll have the full Ghost software with all bells, whistles, themes, plugins, and some extras that are only available with us (like automatic updates and backups).\nWhat's more by choosing to run your blog through our hosted platform, you'll be investing in the future of the software. \nEvery penny we make from our hosted customers will be re-invested to make Ghost better and grow the platform. \nThe sad thing about Open Source software projects funded on Kickstarter is that they usually have an initial flurry of activity when they launch, and then they slowly but surely die off when the money runs out because they have no business model to keep going. We want to build Ghost to be a self-sustaining open source project. \nUsers hosting with us = revenue = development = better software = more users = more revenue = more development = well... you get the idea.\nHow Does it Work?\nWe're incredibly excited about creating the first fully-featured blogging platform in the world that's built entirely with JavaScript.\nGhost is a Node.js application powered by the Express framework. Ghost ships with SQLite, which means it can run pretty much anywhere - however everything is connected through JugglingDB ORM, adding future support for many other database formats.\nGhost will be available via NPM, making it extremely simple (and fast!) to install on all major environments.\nGhost theming is done with Handlebars, which keeps our business and view logic separated. Mmmm semantic + sexy. If you know how to write WordPress themes, you'll be writing Ghost themes in under 5 minutes. Here's an example.\nOf course there's also support for customising and extending your blog with additional functionality via plugins with helpers and data filters built right into Ghost. We'll also be supporting full international translations from the word go using Node Polyglot.js.\nFinally, Ghost is being released under the MIT License. It's pretty much the most free Open Source license out there. It means you can do whatever you want with Ghost, and you can choose whatever license you want when you build something with Ghost. Want to release a GPL Ghost theme? That's fine. Want to release an MIT theme? That's fine too.\nWhere We Are Now\nWe've been slowly working on Ghost since I posted up the idea in November. As you can see from the video, we have a real working prototype - but there's still a lot to do.\nWith your support we can work hard to finish the first complete release of Ghost and get it out into the world. Your backing will help fund:\nDevelopment time. We want to work on Ghost and nothing but Ghost in 2013. We want to ship the first public version of Ghost by the end of the summer.\nLegal stuff. We need to do a couple of important things like register trademarks, and register properly as a non-profit organisation.\nInfrastructure. We've got tons of work to do to complete the Ghost community website and platform to allow us to properly support users, provide hosting, and be the home of Ghost. We want to complete this by the end of the year.\n\nThe People Behind Ghost\nMy name is John O'Nolan. I've been building websites (but mainly blogs) with WordPress since 2005, a year after it was launched. From 2009-2011 I worked as the Deputy Head of the WordPress UI Group, where I helped to design and develop the WordPress user interface - and spoke at conferences all over the world about designing WordPress. I've designed, built, and worked on blogs for companies including Microsoft, Ubisoft, Nokia, Virgin Atlantic Airways, easyJet, MTV, Travelllll.com, Tourism Australia, Tourism Spain, WooThemes, W3 Edge and many others.\nMy main partner in crime, Hannah Wolfe, is a Senior Developer at Moo.com where she is currently working with a small team focused on a little site called Flavors.me. Hannah has been developing WordPress sites for over 7 years and prior to MOO - worked as a developer for a web agency, building websites (and blogs) for large household names in the UK.\nEqually, this first prototype of Ghost would not have been possible without the generous contributions of many other people:\nCode - Rob Hawkes\nCode - Scott Riley\nPhotography - Rick Nunn\nWireframes/UX - Simple as Milk\nCode - Matt Hojo\nCode - Gilbert Pellegrom", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith a software development project like this, the biggest risk and challenge is inevitably shipping on time. To combat delays, we'll be setting regular milestones and making sure we hit them + keep our backers updates. We will be prioritising schedule above features.\n\nOur other biggest challenge will be setting up the hosted platform and infrastructure to support our Ghost customers. Hosting is the area where we have the least experience, and the most to learn. This will not in any way inhibit or delay the creation of the software itself.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #15", "update_userinfo": "Ghost is Here!

In just 4 short days we clocked quarter of a million page views on the new site and answered more emails, messages and tweets than we can remember.

The codebase is unrecognisable compared with the prototype that we started out with when the Kickstarter campaign launched. We've just about got all the core foundations in, and now we're working on building out feature sets (like custom dashboard widgets, themes, and plugin functionality). A few weeks ago we released the first preview to Ghost VIP (\u00a3120+) backers, and we're now slowly starting to open this up further to 3rd party testers and organisations who will be building things on top of Ghost.

Our first issue is being produced to coincide with the Festival of the North East in June 2013, and aims to inform locals and tourists alike about our home region. Side Street is the first edition of our printed magazine, and is the product of our quest to discover true satisfaction in the cultural experiences of the North East. \nOur online project and investigation www.purposeofvisit.co.uk has sought out the problems we face in the modern world of travel, and why it is that travel can sometimes be more stressful than relaxing. Our exclusive, passionate articles offer more fulfilling ways to truly experience Durham, Newcastle, Sunderland, Northumberland and other areas of the North East. Filled with original images, we cover areas such as arts and culture, nature, history, food and drink and everything else the region has to offer but in a slower, deeper and more fulfilling way. \n-Why \nOn her website Gemma Hall, author of \u2018Slow Northumberland & Durham\u2019, describes her book as embracing the Slow Food and Tourism movements: \u201cIts celebration of local distinctiveness, vernacular architecture, regional flavours and simple pleasures. It encourages visitors to seek out the unobvious, explore footpaths, railways trails, byways and B-roads - and linger awhile.\u201d \nWe have taken a firm grasp of the thinking behind all things slow. Rather than be another glossy travel brochure explaining for the thousandth time how great the Baltic is, we take a slow approach. Travel can often be stressful, rushing around, trying to see too much in such short a space of time, leading to a less than fulfilling experience. Slow travel could be the answer to the problem. \nSide Street offers an alternative, slow approach to experiencing the North East. It applies the theory of slow travel to various aspects of the region, be it searching out locally sourced food at a restaurant, walking along one of the region\u2019s beaches or getting to grips with the history as you visit one of Northumberland\u2019s castles. Hopefully it provides a far more enjoyable, educational and most importantly memorable time. \n-Who \nWe are a group of young journalists, some of us born and bred in the North East, who feel truly passionate about exploring these secrets the area holds. We are eager to impart our research, knowledge, discoveries and exclusive interviews with the influx of visitors expected to grace the region over the summer months for the festival. \nWorking with the body of the established journalism school at the University of Sunderland we are all responsible journalists, none of whom know how to hack a phone. What we do know is how to pick one up, talk to a local expert in their field and write an enthralling, well-researched story.\n-How \nMost of the content has already been produced; interviews have taken place, research has been conducted and top quality images have been snapped. Now it\u2019s just a matter of bringing it all together and getting it out there. \n The \u00a31000 we raise will be used to print 3,000 copies set to be distributed all over the North East, from Durham to Northumberland, in cafes, bars, pubs and shops. With this print run we expect to reach 10,000 readers, be they tourists or locals, and provide them with a new light to look upon the North East.\nCheck out our Twitter and Facebook pages\nor e-mail: info@purposeofvisit.co.uk for more information\nAdditional footage provided by Spark TV Sunderland\nMusic provided by O'Messy Life", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf we do not receive enough funding there may be a challenge in raising money via other means to cover printing costs.\nAll of the content (copy and images) will be ready by May 17th, it's just a matter of putting it together but the team have set aside a week dedicated to its production.\nThe only other risk is if we all fall dreadfully ill at the same time, or die.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": [{"Project funds successfully": "33 backers pledged \u00a31,033"}, {"Project launches": "MAY 11, 2013"}]}], "comments": []}}, {"backer": "Jamie Fulbrook", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "UPDATE: WE DID IT!

Please share this project with your friends and family to show them that we care about stories and that we're going to be a part of this global community.\nInternational Story Day Collectors as of May 31st, 2013\nHi there.\nMy name is Brandon and I collect stories from strangers. Thousands of them, in fact.\nBrandon Doman, Founder and Director of the Strangers Project, Collecting Stories in NYC. Photo by Essie of \"Walking the People\"\nI've been running a project that I am passionate about for the past four years and I am ready to take it to the next level with your help.\nAbout the Strangers Project\nThe Strangers Project is a collection of anonymous stories written as \u201cjournal entries\u201d on the spot by passing strangers. I ask people to write about anything they want\u2014as long as it\u2019s true. The result is a mosaic of stories from the lives happening around us at every moment. These are our friends, our families, and people we\u2019ve never spoken to. Every moment billions of stories are unfolding\u2014this is a glimpse into some of those things we may normally not notice. These are our lives.\nYou can read new stories every day and learn more about the project through several channels:\nThe Main Site: http://strangersproject.com\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/strangersproject\nTumblr: http://strangers-project.tumblr.com\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/StrangersProj\nInstragram: http://instagram.com/StrangersProj\nWhat Kind of Stories do people share?\nAbsolutely everything. Some of the stories are funny, some of them are tragic. Some of them are deep reflections on identity. Some of them are adventures. Everyone has a story. Here's a few of them:\nThe stories come in quickly... this is just two weeks worth!\nWhat's Next? Stories from around the world.\nLast summer I tried an experiment and invited others to participate in the project by collecting stories themselves. On July 28th, 2012, I sent 25 volunteer collectors in pairs around the city with packets of the things that I normally use to collect: A sign, stories (for people to read), pens, clipboards, and a LOT of paper. Throughout the day the volunteer collectors shared pictures and live updates of their experience for the rest of the world.\nThe day was a huge success. Now I want to take Story Day to the next level. We are going to invite people to be a part of the project again, but this time on a much larger scale. This summer we're going global with...\nOver the past year I\u2019ve received interest from 100s of volunteers in over 20 countries who want to share the Strangers Project where they live.\nThe project is all about creating public spaces for shared narratives. International Story Day will allow anyone to participate in the project\u2014not only by sharing their story, but by collecting stories in their own communities as well.\nEvent Details\nInternational Story Day will take place later this Summer. We don't want to set an exact date until we can start to gauge just how many participants we will have, but we are going to shoot for a day in either August or September, 2013.\nThis event is going to take a lot of coordination. We are going to make the process as simple as possible to allow anyone that is interested in collecting stories to do so. Over the next couple of months we will be creating training materials and story kits (both official kits and do-it-yourself versions). We'll also set up everything you need to participate in the live stream of the day where participants will be sharing pictures, stories, and experiences in real time with the rest of the world.\nAt the end of it all, the collectors will send in their stories, and we'll compile a special book full of handwritten stories (both from strangers and from collectors about their experience of International Story Day) collected during the same 24 period.\nWe're ready for Story Day, we just need your support!\nThe Strangers Project (myself and my wonderful team of helpers) devotes hundreds of hours to collect, curate, and share these stories. I've dedicated my time and funds to developing the project and purchasing collecting supplies for the past four years. Since I moved to New York the project has grown exponentially. I've been lucky to have volunteers offer to help expand the project, and the Strangers Project could not have reached this level of success without their support.  Now I'm turning to you to help make International Story Day a success.  We've figured out the logistics and have volunteers ready to participate- the only thing keeping us from making International Story Day a reality is the funds, and here's why:\n\nWe want anyone to be able to participate: This means we'll be creating lots of training materials, working out logistics, creating story-collecting kits, and putting together do-it-yourself guides for anyone that is unable to get the official kit.\nInternational Story Day book: Publishing the book will be a lengthy (but fun!) process. We'll need to go through all of the entries and organize them into a volume, design the layout and incorporate volunteer collectors\u2019 responses to the event.\nTime is money: We've already spent a lot of time planning the logistics of the event to figure out what we need to succeed.  Once we've successfully completed this campaign, coordinating the volunteers and making sure that International Story Day runs smoothly will be a full time job!  Your support will allow our fantastic team to get through all the nuts and bolts of event-planning (and fuel the project meetings with coffee so we can make this all happen)!\n\nThank you for your support!\nIf you're interested in collecting stories on International Story Day you can fill out our brief interest form right here.\nUpdate - T-SHIRTS!\nThe t-shirts we are making are screen printed by hand! We want to make sure you're getting a quality shirt, and the best way to do that is to make sure we're giving every shirt the attention it deserves.\nWhether you're collecting on International Story Day or you just want to show how much you love stories, we've got a shirt for you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs for the physical materials, we've created them before and we're ready to make more for you.

We love making stuff, and we know you'll love what we make for you.\n\nOrganizing a global event is a BIG endeavor. We're going to have to pay a lot of attention to logistics, timelines, and even some stuff out of our control like weather. However, We've learned a lot about this project over the past four years and have had experience running events with similar goals.\n\nMost importantly, we have an AMAZING team helping to make this a reality.

These butterflies are more than delicate creatures that travel thousands of miles, over the length of three continents, to spend the winter in Mexico. They fill the mountains, trees and skies with a sea of orange. The sound of their wings silences you. \nMexicans insist they are the souls of dead ancestry that arrive in time to celebrate the Day of the Dead in their country.\nAfter much research I have discovered stories that these butterflies have appeared in times of tragedy, bringing beauty to a sad, sometimes tragic moment and hope to someone that needs it. Is this merely a coincidence?\nThis film will follow the Monarch\u2019s migration from Canada to Mexico, meeting people who have been touched by their coincidental appearance and hearing their heart-warming stories. \nYou may have seen nature documentaries on them, but this will put a super-natural and much more people-focused twist on it. It will be a positive and almost magical look at, not just nature, but a subject we don't love talking about \u2013 death. \nIf we don't hit our budget, then you won't be charged a penny. Of course I'm asking you to help with funding, but also please pass this to one person (or more) who will find this story interesting: lovers of butterflies, Mexico, nature, Day of the Dead... whoever you can think of.

If needed, instead of filming it all in one go, I'll break up the filming into chunks - part this year, part next year.\n\n\n2) Stories: This film is as good as the stories in it. We'll have to confirm the people I have met to visit them and film them. I've been in touch with them, and they are interested... plus I have a feeling we'll meet others along the way.\n\n\n3) Equipment loss or damage: Other than insurance for all of it,  we will be backing up all footage and shipping it back to the UK regularly for safety. And we'll have a creative agency in the UK as well as a network of producers to help with any potential problems. \n\n\n4) The Unforseen: There will be things that come our way.

Our team is inspired to do more. The initial purpose of our Kickstarter campaign was for the opportunity to attempt Janhukot and to be able to film the expedition. We now have that opportunity because of you. Thank you! I believe that we have the potential to do more.\nI want to create the best film that I can.  Our campaign is introducing a stretch goal of $15,000 in support of this.  This will go directly towards making this documentary as inspiring as we can make it.  The funding will be wisely used for professional post-production and editing, as well as additional filming equipment.\nPost-Production & Editing - $2,500\nSound - $1,000\nAerial Footage (Quadcopter) - $1,500\nThank you to everyone that has made this possible and has taken an active role in this campaign.  It's been incredible.\n---------------------------\nJanhukot is a documentary about a team of climbers attempting to reach the summit of Janhukot, one of the last and great unclimbed mountains in the Garhwal Himalayas.\nThis story began in the 1950s. For decades, many teams from around the world have tested themselves against Janhukot, but all have been denied her summit (6,850m).\nOne team climbed further into the unknown than any team before them. They climbed over endless walls of frozen rock and vertical ice while battling weariness and the ensuing cold as they made their final push for the summit.\nThe team came within 300m of the summit, but were turned back. Turned back, but not defeated.\nThis summer, that same team is returning to Janhukot and I will be joining them to document their expedition.\nI was recently introduced to the original footage and pictures that these climbers had brought back with them from the Himalayas (shown in the video above). Some of these climbers had come close to sacrificing everything. One had come dangerously close to death from internal bleeding. Another had to be carried back to civilization and was placed in emergency care for 8 weeks. Yet, they continued to try again and again. It became obvious to me that the story was about more than being the first to climb Janhukot. The \"why\" was the underlying question behind the story.\nLife doesn't exist in this harsh environment, but it's where we feel the most alive. I want to document our passion for the mountains and translate the way that climbing speaks through us. We speak it, think it, and breathe it. My hope is that the \"why\" will inspire those that watch the film.\nIt takes more than a strong body and mind to climb an unclimbed mountain. It takes heart. We thank you for yours and your support.\nYour Support\nYour support will allow us to pay the massive fees for the climbing and filming permits that come along with mountaineering in the Himalayas.\nThe funding from Kickstarter will also help our team pay for food and supplies for 40 days in the Himalayas. Janhukot is 75km from civilization. There are no established trails or places to resupply. Because of the dangerous approach, everything that we need will have to be taken with us and carried on our backs without the help of yaks, mules, or llamas. We will need to hire porters to help bring this incredible amount of supplies to base camp. For many of the local porters, expedition work is their major source of income. It can mean the difference between their families living comfortably or in adversity. Such income can mean sending their children to school, having access to needed medical treatment and being able to control their own lives. Our team is 100% committed to adhering to the most ethical standards of porter hiring. To us, they are an integral part of the team. Thus, we have chosen a local agent who is deeply respected, pays insurance, and ensures that all the porters are well equipped and fit for the job. There are much cheaper alternatives, but the welfare and the wages of the porters are heavily sacrificed.\nYour support to the Janhukot Expedition is invaluable and would make an incredible difference in our bid for the summit.\nExtras\nIn addition to making a documentary, the inspiring imagery that we take back with us will also be used to create a beautiful photo book of our travels through the Himalayas and our attempt to be the first to stand on Janhukot's peak. Personal excerpts from our journals will also be included in the book with the images to convey this once in a lifetime experience.\nMountain TV will be filming a 5 episode pre-expedition series about our team and our training for Janhukot. This will be made available by digital download or DVD.\nThe documentary will be aired during the Reel Rock Film Tour in South Korea and on Mountain TV.\nThe Team\nBryan Hylenski, Team Leader\nJake Preston\nDan Kopperud\nGabe Thomas\nJonn Jeanneret (Jean), Photographer/Videographer", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMountains are dangerous and unpredictable.

It is a synergy between creative exploration and technical precision. A full set consists of three laser engraved, hand inlaid, acrylic glass maps. These maps started in my mind, were designed in illustrator, and brought to life through the use of a high-tech CNC laser. \nEach Dream Series set is limited edition. I'll only be making 3,000 of each color scheme ~ EVER. Every set is hand signed and engraved with a number indicating its place in the series. \nThe Dream Series is made with bold colors because they represents the true nature of our dreams. The maps are made from two different colors of acrylic glass. Each colored piece of acrylic is carefully engraved and cut to create the maps you see here. All of the surface details are created with a high powered laser and display a level of detail that is impossible with any other production method. After the pieces are cut, the intricate land masses are hand assembled to ensure accuracy and precision. \nCompass Inlay for White Maps.\nThe Dream Series maps have gone through 14 design revisions to get to the final product you see here.

But, in a move that stunned fans in 2006, Thile and Nickel Creek went on \u201cindefinite hiatus\u201d while Thile paused to re-assess and, in many ways, start over. Our movie is about what happened next. \nDublin International Airport, 17 January 2008\nThe film follows Thile as he begins again with bold plans to bring to life a 45-minute musical elegy to a failed marriage written for traditional bluegrass instruments\u2014an endeavor that led to the birth and formation of one of the most talented young bands in America, Punch Brothers. HTGAB charts the first steps of the band\u2019s musical journey and looks behind the scenes at the decisions and compromises that must be made by artists looking to evolve and survive. \nThis is a film about starting something. And about the first steps taken in relationships that we sense just might change our lives. The relationship this movie explores is the intimate, dazzling union that is Punch Brothers. But the film is about much more than just a moment in time for a particularly talented band. It is about the creative process itself.\nABOUT THE LIMITED EDITION DVD/BLURAY \nBecause the movie will be available digitally, we feel the DVD/BluRay packages should offer you more in-depth content than the digital experience will provide. Also, we figure, as long as you\u2019re buying actual objects (as opposed to the right to watch 1s and 0s), those objects might as well be something you\u2019d be proud to display in your home or give as a gift. This list of bonus features may change slightly, but here's what we are planning for the hand-numbered, two-disc set:\nAvailable on DVD or BluRay\nA Director\u2019s Commentary Track (featuring some special guests) with insights and stories on how the movie was made.\nOuttakes from the film and previously unreleased performances, rehearsals and late night picking sessions.\nAdditional tunes played by Punch Brothers at Jazz at Lincoln Center\u2019s visually stunning Allen Room. Which show just happened to be Thile\u2019s 27th Birthday. And there was a lunar eclipse that night. \nA never before seen featurette on the making of Punch Brothers' second album \u201cAntifogmatic\u201d\nA handsome 100% PCW 5 x 7 package printed with vegetable-based ink stocks.\nA liner-notes insert booklet featuring the names of ALL our Kickstarter supporters.\nPlus\u2026a few other audio-visual surprises!\nIf the campaign succeeds, we will get to work straight away on producing the DVD/BluRay. To be clear: these deluxe packages would be a limited edition thing. Once they are all spoken for, no others will be made. Ever. \nProof of Concept for the $12 Backers-Only Poster\nNashville Film Festival Poster (11 x 17) by Deke Smith\nTelluride Bluegrass Festival Poster (11 x 17) by Deke Smith\nNewport Folk Festival Poster (11 x 17) by Deke Smith\nHardly Strictly Bluegrass Poster (11 x 17) by Mark Meatto\nTheatrical One Sheet (11 x 17 or 27 x 40) by Mark Meatto & Kevin Gaor\nAmerican Apparel 50/50 T-Shirt (Front)\nAmerican Apparel 50/50 T-Shirt (Back)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with every other aspect of this film, we will do as much as possible \"in-house.\" However, we will be engaging outside vendors to accomplish tasks - like the creation of a glass master for the DVDs & BluRays, the printing of the packages, the silk-screening of the T-Shirts - that are beyond the capability of our independent production company. It is possible that setbacks may arise or production delays may occur. \n\nWe are, however, committed to working as hard as we can to produce and deliver these rewards as quickly as possible. And we will alert our backers about our progress even if we encounter any setbacks.\n\nSince the film is already completed, perhaps the biggest challenge this campaign faces is reaching those fans that would like to own a physical copy of HTGAB if only they knew it was available. This campaign will be a fully grassroots thing that will rely on friends and fans to help spread the word. How to grow a movie?

No excuse for a lack of communication. Problems happen, and many on this site could handle them if he'd be honest about what's going on. But in a situation that's already very annoying, what chaps me even more that I have to read someone trying to convince me that the Punch Brothers have no stake. That's an absolutely ridiculous premise and one that is not worthy of the time it took to type it, the time we took to read it or the space it took on the page. It's certainly possible that they had a stake and didn't watch or like the movie. It's also possible that Thile had a stake and thought a movie about him was dull. Those two tidbits prove nothing. It's also strange to me that in the post, we're told that \"The band's only connection to the film and this Kickstarter is that they agreed to allow Meatto to film them. They don't have a financial stake in the film\", then later says that \"none of us have any knowledge\" of the financial arrangement. The first comment implies some greater level of knowledge than the rest of us have, the latter is an admission that that's not the case. To suggest that a working band on this level would allow a guy to have up close access for a portion of a European tour, shows in the US, practices at their houses, exhaustive in person interviews, etc. without a stake is just patently ridiculous. It's also ridiculous to suggest that they treated it like a soundtrack in a movie - where a song was just played in the background a small support part of a larger unrelated movie. This is a feature length documentary about them personally, and it's not logical to believe they'd allow a for profit documentary that is 100% about them to be made with no \"arrangement\" in place - at the very least to share in any profits and to have no responsibility for losses. It's also not true that they never advertised it on Facebook. I am not a Mark Meatto friend or fan. I heard about it through the Punch Brothers or Chris Thile Facebook pages. There wasn't just one quick hitter, there were repeated posts over a long period of time with links to the site where that trailer was posted alone with no other detail and no updates on screenings, releases, etc. for something like a year or two. I checked that site, then would forget, then would check again when I saw comments. I remember being frustrated thinking - is this thing ever gonna come out anywhere? It stands to reason that all of those posts have all be deleted by now. That's certainly not a hard thing to do. I don't necessarily believe the Punch Brothers have an obligation legal or otherwise to fund it, and I will continue to be a fan and will support the band and its members, but I think the band's management should do some damage control and comment to clear the air since the movie is about them and for their die hard fans, and I think Mark should handle this more professionally and be honest about where it stands rather than making hollow promises once every 6 months. Its not about whether his comments would engender sympathy - that's not the barometer one should read when deciding to communicate. People have given him almost $38 thousand dollars of their hard earned money - so whether the truth elicits sympathy or not is irrelevant. He's owes his backers that honesty when the lack of communication is creating the stir that it is, when people have waited this long, and when this amount of money is involved.", "time": "over 7 years ago"}, {"username": "Glenn Mitchell", "content": "It's about time for another update.

I too have felt disappointed as the delivery date has been pushed out.

I don't know why there have been setbacks delays or failures (however you'd like to put it) so I won't pretend to defend him. Yet I don't think that if he'd communicated more details it would have engendered much sympathy. I for one will withhold any further judgement until I have the final product in my hands. I hope that we'll all soon have the opportunity to judge the final product for ourselves and can distance ourselves enough from the negativity of the campaign to judge it on it's own merits. I think that the saddest thing about the campaign is that regardless of how we might feel about Punch Brothers' involvement or lack thereof this negativity has surely reached them and they are unlikely to ever participate in crowd sourcing of any kind in the future.

Design - \"It\u2019s Angood\u2019s perfectionism for artifice that elevates the Videre beyond mere gimmick to a nostalgic reboot, a celebration of vintage cameras, papercraft, and medium format film photography in one. It\u2019s not designed to make photography simple; it\u2019s designed to make photography fun.\"\nI've come to Kickstarter to help me raise the funds I need to turn my medium format pinhole 'Videre' camera into a do-it-yourself, flat pack kit.\nThis project started over two years ago when I created my first pinhole camera. I\u2019d always wanted a 'real' medium format camera, but I knew I\u2019d never be able to afford one. So I dealt with it the only way I knew how and made one!\nI also designed a 35mm version of this camera which was downloadable from my website in PDF format, so everyone who was interested in the project could make their own version of the camera at home. \nThis project turned out to be a fantastic community project and I was overwhelmed by the amount of people who were as passionate about pinhole photography as me.\nI realised that this community needed a unique design it could call it's own, so I set to work on the Videre - a brand new, medium format pinhole camera specifically designed with this community in mind. \nThe Videre works without a lens, instead using a simple pinhole to take photographs onto medium format film. I have translated my original design into a beautiful and hardwearing do-it-yourself kit so that everyone can make their own Videre camera and learn about pinhole photography in style.\nThe kit will be printed and die-cut onto thick recycled card and supplied with easy to follow instructions and a spare medium format spool. I also plan to produce a short instructional video, which will be viewable online alongside a virtual gallery space where pinhole photographs that have been taken with the camera can be submitted. \nThe estimated delivery of the camera is November, so I'll be trying my very best to get it ready just in time for Christmas!\nPssst - I\u2019m keeping a diary for this project at kickstarterpinholediary.tumblr.com so you can keep up with the progress of the campaign as well as look back over my past two years of work.\nSome of you may be wondering what results you can expect from the Videre. During this project I've been taking portraits with the Videre of some of the people who have inspired me to create this project. The video below is some behind the scenes footage of the shoots and there are some sample shots below.\nYou can download the whole portrait series along with exclusive interviews from each sitter by simply tweeting about or posting on Facebook or LinkedIn.\nGet it here!\nI have the design, I have the quotes from the suppliers and the experience to launch the kit into production, however I don\u2019t have the personal funds to kickstart the process.\nYour support will ensure that the process goes ahead and that anyone that wants a pinhole kit can have one. If the funding campaign is successful I will be able to place orders for materials and get dies made which I would be unable to do without the support of the Kickstarter community. \nI hope to be able to make extra kits in this production run to be able to provide free educational workshops for kids in London, and possibly beyond. \nThe camera will be entirely made in England, using recycled materials wherever possible.\nI understand that November is a long time to wait for your kit to be delivered. \nSo, I have designed a 35mm version of the Videre that can be printed at home and made using everyday household items. \nAs an extra thank-you for your support it will be available as a download in PDF format for everyone who pledges to receive a camera kit on the 10th July 2013. \nHere is a sneak peak...", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOver the past couple of years I have furthered my skills as an artist and designer by developing a medium format camera kit for a company in Japan (to be released mid-2013), developing my original camera into a 35mm version with great success and creating a double exposure pinhole camera from an exhibition at KK Outlet, London. These experiences have allowed me to develop my design skills and have resulted in strong working relationships with suppliers. All my proposed suppliers know about the project and alongside their skills, their excitement in the project makes me confident in my ability to fulfill my promises.\n\nI'm aware that I am likely to face unexpected challenges during this project. Fortunately, I am able to rely upon a fantastic support network of skilled designers, artists and marketing and business professionals for help, if and when I need it. With one foot in the design world, and another in advertising I believe that I have most bases covered whatever challenges this project might throw up.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #22", "update_userinfo": "New 35mm VIDERE now live on Kickstarter!", "update_content": "This spring Kickstarter passed a momentous milestone: over $1 billion pledged to repeat creators.
