[{"backer": "John R Naugle", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "After the kickstarter is over, you can purchase the book  HERE. \nTo receive further updates, sign up for the daily-ish email HERE.\nBecause this idea is so ... different, here are two attempts to describe what the book is about.\nMillions of people are blocked from homesteading because of the sheer expense of getting started.  And millions of elderly people are frustrated that they cannot find somebody worthy to pass their homestead to.  Every year hundreds of thousands of homesteads are abandoned - with the government taking possession about half the time.\nOther homestead owners are looking for land managers or caretakers.  Or some sort of collaboration.  But their efforts have led to horrific results from dishonest or even criminal people - so their homesteads are, effectively abandoned.\nPeople with homesteads are seeking people with REAL experience and skill.\nPeople seeking homesteading opportunities want to build REAL experience and skill.\nThis book is an attempt to bridge these two communities.  People seeking homesteading opportunities are provided a way to accomplish hundreds of things and document them for free.  Eventually, they will be able to peruse hundreds of homestead opportunities.   And people with homesteads will be able to peruse hundreds of homesteaders that have proven their worth.\nActive homesteaders use SKIP to build their skills for their own benefit.  The verification of their skills lends weight to their words on our forums.  Some people already have land and use SKIP to build their skills for caring for their land.\n\nMillions of young people are facing the choices associated with college, debt and a 50 hour work week for the next five decades.  They want to do something productive with their lives that aligns with sustainability and the environment.  They really want to work on the land and have a homestead of their very own.\nMillions of older folks are facing the choices associated with who will get their land when they expire.  They don\u2019t want all the beautiful things they\u2019ve lovingly created by hand to be bulldozed in the pursuit of earning a quick buck.  Other homesteaders and farmers may need good interns or helpers.  They may want to share their property in exchange for a little help around the place.  Older folks without land may just want to bequeath \u201chomestead start-up capital\u201d to participants they\u2019ve taken a shine to.\nMatching aspiring homesteaders with retiring farmers has always been an impossible struggle but we now have a path that will connect the dots.  It\u2019s a lengthy and detailed curriculum of skills for which people can be certified.  Advancing through the levels shows the kind of dedication that older farmers and homesteaders will appreciate and reward.  This system is already working on our website.  Over 2000 skills have been verified, 120 people have earned badges and several future benefactors have signed on.  It is working, we just need to get the word out!\nThe purpose of the book is to:\nfully describe the SKIP system\nshow potential benefactors how robust the program is\ngive aspiring homesteaders/permaculture folks a list of skills that they can complete\nsummarize a huge amount of details into a format that is easy to read, distribute and gift\nThis book does not:\nteach you how to do each skill\ndirectly connect you with an heir/benefactor/land share\n\n\nNote! To select a reward, you MUST use the kickstarter reward menu.\nAbout the time of my fourth kickstarter, I had this powerful feeling of gratitude. How cool is it that so many people are trusting me with their coin for six months? I see other kickstarters that make it clear \"we will sell this for $20 after the kickstarter, so give us $40 for it now.\" I think it should be the opposite of that. You are throwing your shoulder in with me to get this done. You are being far more trusting and supportive than people that wait. So I want you to have the best price, and lots of bonus candy! \n\nThanks for backing my project!   All of the stuff in THANKS is for everybody that supports my kickstarter - even for just $1.  \nI've done so many kickstarters I now have a powerful system for handing out the goodies.  One of the fun things we came up with is \"gift codes\" - a short link that you can use for yourself or give to somebody else.   Maybe this will make some of your Christmas shopping obligations go away!    \nI try to offer something pretty good at the $1 level.  For a movie kickstarter, I try to offer a smaller movie.  For a book kickstarter, a smaller draft of another book.  I am partnering with Chris \"Uncle Mud\" McClellan and Erica Wisner (author of \"The Rocket Mass Heater Builders Guide\") to write a new book.  This rocket mass heater book will focus on base designs, proven enhancements and proven failures.  Also field notes, misconceptions, code, law, shortcuts and a dozen more angles.  We have about 200 pages and are about to invite several more rocket mass heater experts to add their notes.  \nA  documentary about building our \"berm  shed\" - a 1500 square foot shed made mostly out of trees from our  property. An exploration of round wood timber framing joinery. It looks  like a grassy hillside on one side and beautiful log-work on the other.  Oodles of dry storage!\nA book About Trying to build Permaculture community with techniques that are unusual or ...  quite normal, but not generally accepted for community.    I suppose a person could refer to it as experimenting with human beings!  Bwa ha ha ha ha!\nThe most popular book on botany is not available as an audiobook.  I think a book like this probably cannot be made into an audiobook.  So instead, we attempt a page-by-page discussion.  It isn't perfect, but by the end you will have a better understanding of botany.\nIf you're a permies.com member (and why wouldn't you be?) this new feature puts a little Kickstarter \"K\" next to your name on your posts, near your apples and pie.  Hovering over it will show which kickstarters you've supported.  It only shows IF you supported, not how much you contributed.  Any pledge helps and this shows how many campaigns you've been on as we try to infect the world with permaculture! \nI've seen some other kickstarters do this and I think we do it much, much better. They post your name to a facebook page where it is lost and forgotten within a couple days. We post it to our thread at permies.com where we have perennial discussions. Thousands of people will actually look at the list for years to come. And, naturally, we will give you a chance to be as creative and as silly as you want. While some people will post their names, or their kids, or maybe plug their business, you can also divulge your plans for world domination and give yourself all the galactic titles you want. Check out the thanks page from the Better World Book kickstarter.\n\nEverything at this level is for all backers at $5 and up.  Think of it as a bit of \"thanks\" frosting on the THANKS cake! \nThe final product for our 2018 kickstarter.  You will get the HD streaming version and will have the ability to upgrade to downloadable versions or physical DVDs. Details (and trailer) here.\nMy all time best performing kickstarter was so successful, we were able to have a professional audiobook made!   The reviews have been excellent!  This will be a gift code so if you already have the book, you can give this to a friend!  More about the book here.\nJoin our past kickstarter supporters in a place where you can talk about stuff without the prying eyes of google or \"them\".\n\nOnce the kickstarter is over, everybody will get a kickstarter \"survey\" so I can get all sorts of details from you about your preferences. People that supported the kickstarter at $25 or more will be asked how many physical books they want. The remaining number that they paid for will be converted 3-to-1 from physical books to eBook gift codes.\nFor example, at the $65 level, folks can choose between 6 physical books or 18 ebook gift codes. Or a mix! The survey question will ask how many physical books you want. Maybe you will put in \"4.\" So the remaining 2 books are converted, 3-to-1, to 6 eBook gift codes. I will send you 4 physical books and 6 eBook gift codes.\nSome people have asked \"how do the shipping fees work?\" Unfortunately we do not have the ability to scale shipping fees based on the number of physical books selected at a particular reward level. Each reward level has a set shipping fee associated with it according to location. If you are getting only ebook gift codes, then you can select \"US Virgin Islands\" as your shipping location and the shipping charge will be $0 and you will receive 0 physical books.  It's not perfect, but it's the best we can do within the system.\nAnd if you are actually in the US Virgin Islands and want physical copies... congratulations, you get free shipping! \nThis is also a new thing for this kickstarter.  If you would like to support at the higher levels but don't know what you would do with all those books, you can have some go to the Knights Who Say Free committee.  They'll figure out good places in the world that need these books and take care of it for you.\n\nPut your most creative name in the book! (80 character limit). We will reserve a page (more if needed) that says \"Thanks to our Magnificent Kickstarter Supporters!\" Your name appears in our book! Or maybe \"in memory of ____\" or \"mysuperhomestead.com\" or \"The Fabulous Finnegan Family\" or \"Paul Wheaton stinks of old fish\" or \"There once was a gal from Nantucket ...\"  or maybe it is time you gave yourself some excellent galactic titles like \"His Grace, the Duke of Soft Cheeses\" or \"Supreme Ruler of the Bacteria in my Garden\".\n\nYou will be able to specify how many of your 12 SKIP books you want to trade for \"Building a Better World in Your Backyard\" book or a deck of the Permaculture Playing Cards. Just specify how many you want of each and whatever is leftover will be provided as SKIP eBooks (3-to-1).  \nMike and I will foul one pristine book with our filthy signatures.  Apparently some people are into that. \nIt will be the same list as the $65 level, but BIGGER, BOLDER and at the top!\nCome spend a week doing permaculture stuff with us!  More about the bootcamp here and here. \n\nWe will reserve a page that says \"Goofballs Keen on World Domination\".   Here is what it looked like for \"Building a Better World in Your Backyard\":\nHere is an example from the Building a Better World in Your Backyard book:\nVideo Animation and Book Illustration by\nBernal Brothers Studio\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/daydreamer35813/\nMusic by Leroy Anderson - The Waltzing Cat - CreativeCommons Attribution with changes.\nWe have a thread at permies where we are talking about this kickstarter campaign here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nA lot of Kickstarter projects ask for funding before the creator has done much of anything. Before they have any skin in the game. We have been working on this book for six years and have already finished writing the whole thing and revised them numerous times along the way.

I knew that if my phone said there was no monsters it would reassure my daughter, kids believe technology. So I developed a prototype app and tested it. The first night I used the prototype my daughter slept through the whole night in her room and the following week before bed we would scan her room with the Monster Checker app and sure enough she would sleep through the night. \nBottom line the MONSTER CHECKER APP worked. I knew I had to share my inventions with other parents so they too could reassure their children that there were no monsters in their room and help them sleep through the night.\nPlease contribute today to help bring the Monster Checker App to all the parents needing a good night sleep.\nThe Rewards we are offering are...\nThe Win Win Package (Help us to reach our Goal and Advertise your Website, Business, or Yourself)\nMonster Checker is getting a lot of attention from our funding on Kickstarter, we were recently featured on a CBS morning news broadcast and we have more media coverage in the works. We have been contacted by tons of companies wanting to either advertise or cross promote with us. \nFor a $50 dollar contribution we will put a 200 x 200 ad on the MonsterChecker.com home page for 3 months. When the Monster Checker App launches we will be directing everyone there to download it so this will be a great place to advertise.\nWe will also personally thank you in one of our Updates to our Backers. This is a great way to show you supported Monster Checker and to advertise your business, website, blog, Facebook, or even an image of yourself.\nArianna's Reward Package\nOur 3 year old daughter says every day that she wants to help, so this package is dedicated to her. For $250 dollars Arianna will make you a custom video which we will post on MonsterChecker.com, Youtube, and our Kickstarter page. We are getting all types of media attention so this is a great way to advertise your business, website, blog, your Facebook or just yourself. \nArianna is 3 so she will do her best to say your name or company correctly and will also hold up a sign with your info so that it is clear to everyone.

The film aims to create a unique discussion about 1984 on the 30th anniversary, exploring how the events have changed the Sikh community as a whole. When a Tree Falls allows many voices from the Sikh community to be heard, ranging from those who were present during Operation Blue Star and the Delhi riots, the surviving family members and children of the deceased, to notable 1984 historians and activists including H.S. Phoolka and Harminder Singh. \nClick HERE to see a preview of the documentary.\nThe film will debut at Sikh Arts and Film Festival in Orange, California on November 21-23, 2014. If you like to attend please go to sikhlens.com.\nAll of you have pledged a lot and we thank you. We do need little more help in completing this film. We are short of $3,000 for post production. Post production involves hiring musicians, graphics designer and artist to help complete the documentary. Post production makes or breaks the film.\nIf you can please increase your pledge. If you can't then please ask your family or friends to make a modest $25 donation toward the film.\nBackground\nThirty years ago, the largest human rights disaster of India\u2019s post-1947 history occurred. Although some witnesses suggested that the events were planned for later in November 1984, the death of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi at the hands of her Sikh bodyguards marked the trigger event for retaliation. The entire state apparatus was mobilized for the killing of Sikhs. Official buses and petrol were used to transport the killers; petrol was provided for killing; voter lists were utilized to identify Sikh property and households. All the while Indian government looked the other way.\nThe People\u2019s Union for Civil Liberties and the People\u2019s Union of Democratic Rights published a joint report in December 1984, called \u201cWho are the Guilty?\u201d The report stated that \u201cthe attacks on the members of the Sikh community in Delhi... far from being spontaneous expressions of \u201cmadness\u201d and of \u201cgrief and anger\u201d at Mrs. Gandhi\u2019s assassination, as made out by the authorities, were the outcome of a well-organized plan marked by acts of both deliberate commission and omission by important politicians of the Congress and by authorities in the administration...\u201d\nDespite over 11 government inquiries that have named direct culprits, the Indian Government refuses to indict its own members. Even today, in 2014, the leader of the Opposition party and ProTem Speaker of the Lok Sabha (India\u2019s Parliament) is Kamal Nath, who was directly mentioned by eye witnesses as leading the mobs that killed Sikhs in November 1984 and headed the destruction of the historic Gurdwara Rakab Ganj.\nThe Golden Temple under attack\nAbout the Project\nThe exhibition will feature articles both contemporary and historic, personal letters, accounts, archival footage, photo montages, and artistic interpretations commissioned by the project committee, and testimonials from the survivors. The exhibit is being designed in collaboration with Chapman University\u2019s Leatherby Libraries and the Rodgers Center for Holocaust Education. \nThis exhibit is the first of its kind in the world. Produced by leading scholars, it brings together new materials, photographs, and materials for this compelling exhibit that will challenge the silence and make sure this most important episode is never forgotten.\nAftermath of mob attack on Sikh family home\nPolice beating Sikh, 1984\nA boy holds a picture of a father killed in 1984 riots\nOver 3,000 Sikhs were murdered in Delhi alone over three days in November 1984. However, the violence wasn\u2019t just confined to Delhi, but unleashed throughout India. Sikhs were killed in Uttar Pradesh, especially in Kanpur and Lucknow. \n\nThe steel town of Bokaro bore the brunt of the violence in Bihar. In Madhya Pradesh, the violence was spread over nearly 40 towns including Indore, Bhopal, Jabalpur, Ujjain, Raipur, Gwalior, Raigharh, Mahendergarh and Bina.\n\nSimilar attacks of violence occurred in Haryana, West Bengal, Himachal Pradesh, Assam, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Gujarat. Recently as 2011, two mass grave sites in Haryana, at Hondh Chillar and Pataudi (near Gurgaon) were discovered.\nAbout the booklet\nAccompanying the exhibit will be a limited edition booklet. The booklet will contain some never- seen-before images and provide new insights from scholars about the events. It will provide a deeper historical context, new comparative approaches, and a shift in paradigm for thinking about the 1984 tragedy.\nAbout the Exhibition at Chapman University\nThis exhibition is the first of its kind in the world.

Twenty stories of gloves lost in New York, of brave escapers who got out into the big rough world. But is one enough to make a journey? \nThe book is made of tear-away postcards, so you can pick any escaper of your own and give it a second chance by sending it on a new adventure around the world. \nBACKGROUND\nMy name is Polina and I live in New York City. I moved here two years ago from a Russian city named Yekaterinburg. I came to New York with big dreams and hopes, being sure that my talent would conquer the world.\nSoon enough New York showed me that I had to play by its rules. My hometown was already too small for me but I was not yet big enough for NYC. Without any friends here, I was going through a harsh social withdrawal. The only way to fight it with was to get inspired by it. That's when I started to explore the topic of isolation in New York. \nABOUT \"THE ESCAPERS\"\nes\u00b7cape \u2014 to break free from confinement or control. \nIn 1965 Edward White was the first American to walk in space. While he was outside a spare glove floated out from the open hatch. The glove stayed in orbit for about a month before it burnt up in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. \nEscaper #7\nOne needs a lot of courage to start an adventure. But is one enough to make the journey? Sometimes we live our lives waiting for an adventure but we don\u2019t even notice that the main adventure passes right in front of us. \nDuring the past winter I was shooting lost gloves on the streets of New York. It was my way to get rid of the habit of losing gloves every week or so. As my collection of escapers grew I realized the real reason I kept photographing garbage on the streets. \u2018The Escapers\u2019, a logical addition to my ongoing project \u2018Community\u2019, is also a reflection of isolation in New York. To survive in this city, you are up against those who are smarter, stronger, more talanted, and hungrier then you are. It\u2019s very hard to do it all alone, but it\u2019s even harder to avoid staying alone in New York.\nEscaper #8\nFor the whole fall-winter-spring season I was shooting photographs of escaped gloves on the streets of New York with my pocket film camera. I got a pretty big collection (you can't imagine how many of them there actually are). Then I sorted out the 20 most interesting stories.\nWHAT'S NEXT?\nNext I decided to make a book. But not just a simple photo book (a typical photo book which only has photographs of gloves might be a little boring).

My name is John Phillips, but my artist name/alter ego/ stage name is Clyde Biggs. I am a musician, singer, songwriter and independent recording artist. I've been studying and performing music for thirty years, and recording music for twenty years.\nOver the course of my lifetime I have played in several bands. I started out playing Top 40 and in cover bands. Eventually, I had the urge to start writing my own lyrics and the desire to put music to it.\nMY MUSIC AIRPLAY\nRadio Airplay is a site that offers artists statistics on fan support and demographic reports of their songs played on the air. Below is a profile of listeners who've heard my music on Internet Radio.\nRadio Airplay Listener Demographics for the Make it Happen album\nMY MUSIC GENRES\nThe classification of the music I produce ranges within the following genres: rhythm & blues, easy listening and rhythm and blues/dance.\nMY INSTRUMENTS\nNot only am I musically inclined, but in this day and age I AM A MUSICIAN WHO PLAYS ALL OF HIS INSTRUMENTS. I stress this fact because it is an important one in my continued development. I play the bass guitar, keyboards, rhythm guitar and electronic drums.\nJohn Phillips (aka Clyde Biggs) performing with bass guitar\nMUSICAL INFLUENCES\nHaving musical influences that guide my development is important because it adds strength to your writing skills. My musical influences range from rock groups to soul groups. Two examples of musical groups and personalities that have influenced my growth as an musical artist are The Carpenters and The Isley Brothers.\nMY FIRST CD/ALBUM \"Make It Happen\"\nMake it Happen was independently released February 2013. Although it is for sale on sites like cdbaby and iTunes, it has been a struggle to create buzz and monetize.\nThe inspiration behind Make it Happen was based on my own life experience. My philosophy is that if you work hard at something you can succeed, thus the title. All of my songs convey a positive message in the listening. This is the only album that has my late departed sister Dianna singing vocals. One of the reasons for seeking your support in distributing this album is to keep her voice, memory and talent alive even though she is no longer with us in this life.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI am a hard working, ethical musician constantly working to succeed in my efforts. I have a proven track record of one album under my belt, with a second one on the way. With your support I can successfully distribute the first album Make it Happen to a wider audience and continue advancing my skills as an artist with recording my second album The Lord of Production. I realize there are risks and challenges to any project and that as an artist I have to be able to manage these issues. I am not naive where this matter is concerned but I believe in my proven talent and that I can finish my Kickstarter campaign's objectives. I have six songs already written and musically arranged for the second album The Lord of Production, that's under way.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "John Phillips\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nMy name is John Phillips.I was born & raised in Seattle WA.

Without a doubt, Maimouna has shown promise over the years. Since receiving her Grammy nomination with The Roots in 2007 for their hit, \u201cDon\u2019t Feel Right,\u201d Maimouna has made waves in the music scene with three independent projects: The Black Magic Woman EP (2011), her first full length studio album, The Blooming (2011), and her latest project, The Reintroduction of Mumu Fresh (2014). These three lauded solo projects, along with her performances on tour with The Roots, and collaborations with music giants such as Nas, Erykah Badu, Jill Scott, and countless others, have all earned Maimouna striking comparisons to Lauryn Hill in her prime. However, thriving, let alone surviving, as an independent artist without the financial support and superpowers of a record label or megalithic corporation can be challenging. Luckily, Maimouna has been able to build a loyal following at home and abroad off the strength of her music and captivating stage performances alone. Without you, the fans and supporters, Maimouna would not have gotten as far as she has. This campaign aims to energize fans to help Kickstart the next level of #TheMuvement, allowing Maimouna to continue to do what she does best without trepidation.\nABOUT THE MUSIC\nMaimouna\u2019s commitment to providing a balanced perspective on current social, racial, political, gender and class issues has been a hallmark of her music. For her next album, due out in the second quarter of 2015, Maimouna is taking a global approach and incorporating influences such as reggae, dub step, afro-beat, azonto, hip hop, and bluesy soul to help spread her uplifting message of love and self-empowerment. She\u2019s already recorded two songs with Femi Kuti (son of the late afro-beat pioneer Fela Kuti) for the project. Other notable collaborators on the album will include producers like Chucky Thompson (producer for late The Notorious B.I.G, Ma$e, etc...), as well as new and upcoming talents.\nJust as important as the music are the visuals. Maimouna and Director Brian Kyle Atkins have already teamed up to produce three great high quality music videos \n and are ready to create even more positive, authentic and compelling visuals to accompany the new project.\nAbout The World Tour\nFinally, this Kickstarter campaign will also help fund the first ever Mumu Fresh World Tour. While her recorded music is equally captivating as it is poignant, Maimouna\u2019s live show is guaranteed to convert any remaining non-believer. Many have yet to experience Mumu\u2019s electrifying stage presence and overpowering vocal ability live, so upon completion of this amazing new project, it\u2019s Team Mumu Fresh\u2019s goal to give fans of good music and exquisite showmanship the opportunity to experience the new material in a live performance. With your support, Maimouna will reach markets she\u2019s never reached, as well as areas overseas where her fan base is strongest, including parts of Europe (Germany, UK, France, etc.), South Africa, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Australia, Japan, and many others. She\u2019ll also make her long-awaited return to U.S. cities including, but not limited to, New York, New Jersey, North Carolina, Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit, Denver, and Los Angeles.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOne of the greatest challenges for any musician is getting their music recorded and into the ears of as many people as possible. It\u2019s been an especially enduring challenge for Maimouna as an independent artist who also just so happens to be an activist and educator. If she isn\u2019t hard at work in the studio, Maimouna is often organizing and conducting music workshops for youth in local communities, touching the lives of kids with the gift of music.\n\nLuckily, Team Mumu Fresh is not just the artist herself, but a committed team of seasoned music business professionals working together with Maimouna to advance her career and build her rep as the star she was born to be. Her team has been great at building and sustaining excellent professional relationships that have allowed Maimouna to do so much with so little, including touring with The Roots, making her big screen debut in Dave Chappelle\u2019s \u201cBlock Party\u201d movie, completing her three independent projects and videos and many other accomplishments.

We hit it off right away after we realize how we have the same life principles. She introduced me to a music style called KPOP \u2013 Korean Pop. I liked it right away. It's very catchy even though I'm not able to understand the lyrics. Through this new music, Catherine and I decided to travel around second life and look for KPOP venues. We searched for about 6 months but we could not find anything that resembles an \u201calive and kicking club\u201d. So we made a decision to start our own venue so people who also like this type of music can have a place to meet-up and have a fun place to relax and make new friends. We started Club Hallyu. Hallyu is a Korean word which means \"Korean Wave\". It refers to the increase in the popularity of South Korean culture since the late 1990s.\nCatherine and I agreed that if even one person showed up for our first live DJ set, we will be ecstatic. 2 people showed up. We were ecstatic! We continued posting invitations for the live DJ parties we were having. 2 years later, we have 850+ members. We get an average of 25+ people per live DJ sets. We have about 3-4 DJ sets per week.\nOn those 2 years we had the club open, we introduced the Korean and other Asian cultures through contemporary music, arts, lifestyle and festivals. We learned basic Korean language. We have one of our live DJ's teaching Japanese. The group we started is compromised by people of all ages, countries, nationalities, different beliefs. We all got along together because of one common goal, to expand our knowledge about the Asian culture. I am a Filipino, Chinese, Spanish and Italian decent through both of my parents. But it still opened a broader perspective of what being Asian really is.\nAfter 2 plus years of running the club with the gracious help of dedicated, non-salaried staff we became one of the most popular and hottest Asian venue in second life. We believe in an open mind, non-judgmental attitude to everyone that came in and joined Club Hallyu. We are a G-rated group so even parents that are in second life will feel comfortable to have their real life kids also join our club. We have stores in our island that sold KPOP, JPOP (Japanese Pop), Asian themed crafts and anime items. Artists from all walks of life created these virtual items that complimented our group theme. We are still active in second life but unfortunately we had to close the virtual club for now because we wanted to bring our group out into real life too. Juggling two venues is not realistic and we won't be able to focus entirely out here in real life.\nThat's where we are now. We are asking your help to bring the Asian experience that a lot of second life people in our group had in the US. We want to start here in Jacksonville, Florida. A great alcohol free place where 14 years old and older people can meet-up and experience a different kind of Asian culture that is both exciting, fun and to go beyond the stigma of Asian stereotypes.  Also, even $1 or $5 will make a difference in reaching the goal. Plus, you won\u2019t get charged until the end of the campaign.

How can they be used not only for novelty - but for good? In setting out to answer this question, we found that not only do they have the ability to affect positive change, they also have the chance to save innocent lives.\nThere are many ways that LiDAR equipped UAS can be used for good. From 1964 to 1973, the United States dropped nearly 2 million tons of explosives on Laos to stop the movement of North Vietnamese troops and munitions (via the Lao National Unexploded Ordnance Programme). These munitions still affect daily life in the region and hamper economic growth. Through the development on an unmanned aerial system that maps UXO in agricultural and forested areas, personnel can survey for ordnance without endangering themselves or the local population.\nThis campaign will fund Arch Aerial's development and prototype testing for a heavy-lift Arch Aerial UXO Drone, that can carry a LiDAR (light detection and ranging) unit on board to map unexploded ordnance (UXO), through identification of the impact signatures in both forested and agricultural areas. These 3D models of the topography can be used by organizations involved in the removal of UXO.\nWe want to use drones equipped with scanning LASERS to map the changes in topography from the impact of unexploded ordnance in both forested areas and cleared agricultural land.\nThis fundraiser will allow us to build the ideal platform for UXO survey: a multi-rotor UAS that is designed for 20-30 minute flight times after the attachment of a third-party LiDAR unit for small-scale LiDAR survey in remote areas. For more information on the LiDAR payload, please visit the 'FAQ' section of our page.\nWe are the ideal organization to develop a UXO drone. In addition to building small four-rotor UAS, we also manufacture heavy-lift eight rotor UAS that can carry up to 14 pounds. With a head start on design for the platform, we can focus on implementation and field survey. Our drones have been featured on Popular Science, Yahoo!, ESPN, Tech Cocktail, Al Jazeera, LiveScience, and Futura Sciences. We started building UAS (unmanned aerial systems) for archaeologists, but now we build and operate drones for a wide variety of projects around the world.\nThis project matters, and we need your help. By building, designing, and testing a UXO locating drone, we'll be able to equip humanitarian organizations around the world with a much safer alternative to pedestrian survey in mine fields. You are directly contributing to getting hi-tech tools in the hands of humanitarian projects for a real impact. \nWe plan on not only sharing our story, but the stories of those affected by UXO munitions in remote areas like Laos and Vietnam. We'll be filming a documentary throughout the entire process, and we intend to use your funding to finance UXO drone development and a small portion of the fundraiser to complete a low-budget documentary chronicling the process.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are working with an aggressive timeline for development and field testing, but that happens to be an environment in which we thrive. While developing our first UAS prototype, we had 6 months to start from scratch and deliver a durable, go-anywhere quad-copter. In those 6 months, we designed, built, and field tested our UAS in Belize and the Mediterranean, and now produce Atlas-1 quads as our top-selling product. \n\nFor this project, we'll use our own existing eight-rotor design and customize the platform for a heavy-lift payload capacity. We will design and test numerous imaging and remote sensing systems for implementation, and then take our work out to one of the toughest environments for UAS operation.\n\nTIMELINE (See above info-graphic)\n\nOnce we complete the fundraising portion of our project, we'll move to the design phase. Design, development, and testing will be conducted from October to December, and we will move to field testing in January and February of 2015. The field testing portion of our development will consist of a month long campaign in Laos to assist local organizations in UXO identification and mapping. Once we've collected results from our field testing session in Laos, we will return to our lab in Texas in late-February to perfect the design and begin production on a model that can be used by humanitarian organizations around the world. Delivery on Arch Aerial UXO drones will begin in May of 2015.\n\nIn addition to sharing out our story through the documentary, we have also applied to host a SXSW Interactive (March 2015) panel to discuss the UXO drone story and share our experience with humanitarian groups who want to implement cutting edge technology in remote areas. If you would like to see our panel go through, please check out the Kickstarter links on this page to visit our panel page in the SXSW Panel Picker.\n\nBOMB LOCATION\n\nWe are locating UXO, a dangerous endeavor!

That's right, the time has come--I'm opening my very own comfort-style Southern Kitchen restaurant in NYC!\nAt Carla Hall's Southern Kitchen, you'll find slow-cooked, fast-served food that hugs you. A neighborhood eatery serving up old-fashioned southern goodness. You'll be welcomed like family and soon feel right at home. \nMy Nashville-inspired \"spot next door\" will take you back to my sweet ole' Granny's kitchen--the place my love of food started and what made me the chef I am today. I\u2019m bringing the full-of-love, southern Nashville goodness to you, and done right!\nLet Me Catch You Up\nI\u2019m Carla Hall. You may know me from my time on Bravo's Top Chef, or more recently on the food talk show The Chew, which I co-host on ABC. You might even have one of my beloved recipe books on your kitchen shelf.\nI grew up in Nashville and learned to appreciate good food from my grandmother, Freddie Mae. Let me tell you about it:\nAnd now, I'm ready to serve up authentic Nashville love in New York City with\u2026\nNashville Hot Chicken!\nWhat is Nashville Hot Chicken? It\u2019s a unique twist on southern fried chicken, traditionally fried in an iron skillet and then tossed in a spicy cayenne paste. Slow brined, brushed with my secret hot oil recipe, and crisped to perfection. You\u2019ll find it served simply, on a slice of white bread with a dill pickle. Oh, and anybody who\u2019s had Nashville Hot Chicken has a hot chicken face:\nWhy Now, Carla?\nTo be honest I resisted the idea of opening a restaurant for years. I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to serve yet. I thought long and hard about it, and then it came to me like a sweet smell. Fried chicken! Fried chicken and southern sides! Ok, here are all the juicy details..\nWhat\u2019s For Dinner\nIt's all about the chicken! I'll be servin' it up real hot with some of my other favorite sides like southern greens, mac and cheese, picnic coleslaw, and don't forget the country white bread and pickles. Oh, and cornbread waffles on the weekends. And then when it's time for dessert? Goo Goo clusters, red velvet whoopie pies, bread pudding, and my guilt-free petite cookies! Can you taste the goodness?!\nSouthern Fried Hot Chicken in The Big Apple\nBacker Rewards\nThis is where you come in. I've come up with a bunch of great goodies as rewards for backing this Southern Kitchen. Each one crafted by me with some sweet southern gratitude. See which one strikes you:\nHelp Me Build My Kitchen\nI\u2019m here on Kickstarter to build the actual Southern Kitchen. \nI have been cooking and sharing my love of food in one way or another for too many years to count, and along the way I have earned the love of millions of fans across America. Some of those fans have become good friends, and some of those good friends have become as close as family to me. \nBuilding a restaurant is a lot of work, and I\u2019m building a team to help me do just that, but I knew the only place I could go for support to build something as personal to me as the kitchen in my first restaurant, is to my fans. No, my family.\nI hope you'll be as excited about this as I am, and I want to share ALL of the ups and downs with you, from the very start, which is NOW!\nThank you Drexel!\nMy grandmother taught me, so you know I need to pass it on! In a unique partnership between our new Southern Kitchen and Drexel University\u2019s Center for Hospitality and Sport Management, culinary and hospitality students at Drexel will work alongside me and my team to learn every aspect of opening a new restaurant.\nThe Drexel team will work on-site in the new restaurant and in the Drexel Food Lab to:\nDevelop recipes and test menu items\nWork on sourcing the best products\nAnalyze food, labor and energy costs\nDesign my restaurant kitchen!\nTest and recommend commercial equipment\nCreate \"best practices\" for the Southern Kitchen roll-out\nHelp recruit and hire Carla\u2019s restaurant team\nIf you think you know what culinary or hospitality school is like, think again!

My goal with Foxing was to spotlight literature and comics within our city and beyond. We\u2019ve done this through readings, art shows, concerts, book swaps, and even a small-scale literary festival (pictured).\nFoxing's Summertime Lit Fest 2013 (Photo by Cayla Dyanne Bramlett)\nNew South is a continuation of Foxing's mission. With the money raised through this campaign we plan to establish a large-scale books and comics festival for June 2015: a four-day celebration with two days of festival, bookended by corresponding events like an art show and concert. The festival, taking place on Saturday (6/7) and Sunday (6/8), will feature a book fair with 120-150 exhibitors and cross-disciplinary panels. New South will celebrate independent literature, alternative comics, small presses, and print culture. It will be highly curated, focused, fresh, and irreverent. \nNew South Logo by New York Times Bestselling Cartoonist Box Brown\nSince Foxing's inception, I have been fortunate enough to meet and collaborate with some very talented literary entities here in town, all of which have become good friends. American Short Fiction, A Strange Object, Austin Review and Write Bloody will have a hand in organizing this event alongside Foxing. Together, we'll work hard to make this festival a reality.\nAdditionally, your support will help us launch new year-round literary and comic programs under the New South umbrella. We see this as an opportunity to explore new methods of encouraging literacy and comic arts within our community. \nWe can only do this with your support. Please help us get started. Join us in launching New South\u2019s first year!\nThanks so much,\nDanithan\nEditor & Founder | Foxing Quarterly\nOur team  consists of several figureheads from the eclectic variety of lit journals and publishers in Austin.* Our collective mission is to support the literary arts at the local level and to bring publishers, writers, cartoonists, artists and readers into conversation. There is a very strong, budding literary scene happening right now in our city. We would love to encourage its growth. Together, we believe we can establish a very unique and exciting literary event in Austin. \nDanithan (Foxing Quarterly), Director\nJill Meyers (A Strange Object), Literary Director\nShannon McCormick, Programming Coordinator (Comics)\nAdeena Reitberger (American Short Fiction), Programing Coordinator (Lit)\nRebecca Markovitz (American Short Fiction), Programing Coordinator (Lit)\nDerrick Brown (Write Bloody), Master of Ceremonies\n*We are all working on this event for free. No money from this campaign will go into organizer payroll. \nThe French Legation Museum is a beautiful outdoor venue in East Austin. It is primarily used for weddings, but is also home to the very popular annual film series, Cinema East. \nThe space caps at 2,000 people. It is a perfect setting for a large-scale summer event. It has 3 large lawns (for exhibitors), 1 smaller lawn (for hourly panels), electrical outlets throughout, driveway for food trucks (very important), and a small loft above the museum office (green room for exhibitors and special guests).\nIt's important for us to keep this festival FREE & OPEN TO THE PUBLIC. This will help us encourage the growth of our local scene. And, as a frequent exhibitor at various festivals, I know the added pressure of costly table rates. By keeping TABLE FEES CHEAP for exhibitors, we'll buffer exhibitors' travel expenses and increase their profit margin at New South. \nFurthermore, we plan to establish ourselves as a 501(c)3 Nonprofit organization. A small chunk of money received will go towards making this happen. There are certain benefits attached to 501(c)3 status: tax exemption, ability to accept tax-deductible donations, legitimacy of IRS recognition, and access to a wider selection of grants for further funding. This will help us continue to grow community outreach projects in our city.\nTables & Chairs - $2,500 (Estimated for 120-150 Exhibitors) \nSignage and Advertisement - $2,000\nTents - $1,350\nDelivery/Setup fees- $290\nA/V - $250\nSecurity (Required at the space) - $400\nNonprofit Startup Fee - $850\nKickstarter Rewards & Shipping - $1,800 (estimated)\nKickstarter Fees - $2,000 \nVenue - $5,500\nTOTAL - $16,940\nThe remaining amount will help with any unexpected fees/emergency costs and, if this inaugural fest is successful, contribute to building New South's 2016 year. \nWith the help of many of our amazing friends, we have curated a wonderful cache of incentives for helping us fund this campaign. \nRewards include: original art, zines, lit journals, exhibitor space at the event, advertising opportunities, posters, apparel, stickers, buttons, and more!\nFoxing & Friends Event for AWP 2014 (Illustration by Leigh Luna)\nBack in February, New South's organizers hosted a Post-it art show & reading at the Fantagraphics Bookstore & Gallery in Seattle, Washington.

Secure customized production quantities of the KEVLAR\u00ae-Nylon Composite \nIn creating a market-ready version of THE ARGONAUT, our design team implemented the lessons learned from our LIGHT WING and NINJA projects to improve our original boot prototypes, design processes, and material selection to complement the TYVEK\u00ae upper.\nOur friends over at DUPONT pointed us in the direction of KEVLAR\u00ae.\nAfter months of experimenting on different blends, we chose a nylon-composite form of KEVLAR\u00ae that allowed us to create a strong and water resistant barrier.\nKEVLAR\u00ae is an amazing material that dates back five decades and is an ultra-high strength Polymer developed by DUPONT. It's best known as the material that provides the strength and durability in military and police grade flak jackets. It is also used in body armor utilized by first responders, and it is found on the outer skin of the International Space Station.\nCombining our newest material KEVLAR\u00ae with our rigorously tested tear proof and water resistant TYVEK\u00ae paper, our design team was satisfied with the durability, water resistance, and flexibility of our high upper. \nThe original prototypes of THE ARGONAUT used high grade leathers, but our entire team felt a disconnect with using such a classically accepted shoe material with technology driven materials like like TYVEK\u00ae and KEVLAR\u00ae. \nOur research discovered a derivative of the MICROFIBER we were already using in THE NINJA series that delivered huge wins in our following tests.\nThis LEATHER-GRADE MICROFIBER is amazing for three reasons:\nFirst, our tests show that this material is more water resistant and durable than the high quality leather used in our original prototype.\nSecond, implementing the microfiber improves our material use efficiency by nearly 30%.\nAnd last but certainly not least, our use of this material creates a Creature Conscious boot that does not rely on animal-derived materials.\nThis rapid re-vamp has been designed and executed in our attempt to provide a quality piece of footwear that streamlines the design process from ideation to your doorstep.\nTHE ARGONAUT for Kickstarter will be released in a BLACK colorway and a BROWN colorway. Like our previous Kickstarter projects, all shoes will have a unique Kickstarter Serial Number that reflects its limited release. \nHelp us reach our $150,000 STRETCH GOAL so we can release an additional four colors:\nTHE ARGONAUT Backer Levels are as follows:\nARGONAUT - PIONEERS - $88 \u2013 SOLD OUT - Help us pioneer forward.

ALL BACKERS WILL RECEIVE A MESSAGE FROM US TO REQUEST YOUR SHOE SIZE ON OCTOBER 29. \nARGONAUT SIZING:\nTHE ARGONAUT is a unisex design and will be available in the following sizes.\nUS Men's Size 5-15 || US Women's Size 6.5 -16.5 || EURO 37-48 \nOnly FULL SIZES will be available for MEN, and the equivalent HALF SIZE associated for WOMEN. (e.g USM 5 = USW 6.5 = EURO 37)\nCLICK HERE TO VIEW FULL SIZING CHART with measurement instructions.\nIn addition, the following sizes will be tailored for a more narrow fit to help accommodate the average foot profile of women in this size range: \nUSM5/USW6.5/EUR37\nUSM6/USW7.5/EUR38/39 \nUSM7/USW8.5/EUR40\nGetting the right fit in shoes is always a bit tricky. It will never be perfect, but we feel confident that you should get the right fit. The width of the shoe is between a D/E.\nBecause we are not producing half sizes, we suggest that you order the next half size up (i.e. if you're a 9.5, you'll want to order a 10). \nWe are constantly exploring new materials and the application of those materials in footwear. Obviously there are many materials and design elements that go into our shoes, and THE ARGONAUT is a synergy of two years of material experimentation, including: KEVLAR\u00ae, TYVEK\u00ae, MICROFIBER, EVA Foam Rubber, and the POLIYOU Insole. \nThe combination of these material choices has allowed us to perfect our strength to weight ratio. On top of its awesome durability and incredible resistance to water, the boot keeps to our standard of being Impossibly Light, and weighs in at less than 420g per shoe (Men's size US 11). \nOur choice of KEVLAR\u00ae came from our need to find an ultra-lightweight textile that could shed water, and maintain a high strength to weight ratio. KEVLAR\u00ae is a polymer that has a unique crystaline structure that gives it incredible strength. \nKEVLAR\u00ae was discovered in 1965 at DUPONT by chemist Stephanie Kwolek while trying to synthesize materials for production in lightweight automobile tires.\nOriginally known as Poly Paraphenylene Terephthalamide, KEVLAR\u00ae is most commonly known for its use in flak jackets and body armor of police and military personnel around the world.\nWe have chosen a KEVLAR\u00ae-Nylon composite that takes advantage of all the great properties of the polymer while also providing a sufficient level of breathability in the upper of the boot. \nTYVEK\u00ae, also a DUPONT manufactured material, looks and feels like paper, but is actually a brand of flashspun high-density polyethylene fibers, that is incredibly strong, water resistant, and durable. TYVEK\u00ae is the core component of all our LIGHT WING series shoes, and it is the core design piece of the high quarter on THE ARGONAUT.\nTHE ARGONAUT LEATHER-GRADE MICROFIBER is a derivative of the same material used in THE NINJA series. At 1/20th the diameter of a strand of silk, this MICROFIBER has the same principals of leather, and reduced wastage, as it is 30% more efficient in terms of materials used in production.\nThe LEATHER-GRADE MICROFIBER we have chosen for THE ARGONAUT uses a unique protective barrier that seals off water, and looks and feels like leather. \nTHE ARGONAUT utilizes our time tested and athletic shoe inspired POLIYOU Insole. POLIYOU has three core features; it has great ventilation, it absorbs moisture efficiently, and helps prevent growth of odor-causing bacteria.\nThe POLIYOU insole is also easily removable for those who prefer using custom insoles or orthotics.\nHaving spent two years experimenting with EVA, and street testing higher grades of EVA, we have developed our first \"Rugged\" EVA foam rubber outsole. \nThis sole has been street tested by our founders for nearly 22 months, and the EVA has stood up to tremendous wear and tear.\n1. We create footwear that is Impossibly Light. \n2. We advance technology through every aspect of our design, material choice, and business model. \n3. We are empowering tomorrow's leaders by cooperating with leading education organizations to to make science cool.\nWe think Science is Cool, and it is the thread that ties every element of our company, our culture, and our brand together. We create awesome shoes so we can change the world.\nWe believe changing the world starts with empowering tomorrow\u2019s leaders with an awesome education and access to rock star educators. You can find out how we are working with Teach for America this school year by clicking here.\nTechnlogy is our passion, and it is the fundamental element that drives the hundreds of laboratory experiments that take place on every aspect of footwear design we produce before it hits the market.\nWe are an interesting mix of industrial designers, graphic artists, ceramic artists, logistics specialists, and serial entrepreneurs. You can visit our site and learn more about us here, but in a nutshell the core team is six people who have come together by a random connection over the past two years, who each as individuals, really wanted to change the world around them.\nUnbelievable Testing Laboratory is now our vehicle to do awesome things.\nToken Hu, founder and head designer is a native Chinese with years of experience at frog design and Microsoft. Shaun Nath, originally from Southern California, is a brand expert and logistics specialist who was introduced to the project by Joseph Constanty, a native of Philly, and the ever persistent entrepreneur in China. Jay Legaspi, a NJ/NYC native and recent Georgetown MBA grad is the resident \"sneakerhead\" who runs marketing. Wyatt Bai and Kong Kong are our graphic whiz-kids behind any media we produce. \nWe've also been fortunate to have brought on amazing interns who have assisted in everything from product development, PR, and animation. To Jono, Victoria, Olivia, Kelly, Maria, Bee, Lizzie, and Jacquie: Thank You.\nTHE ARGONAUT is our next iteration in manufacturing development which is focused on speed to market from concept to your doorstep.\nThe shoes you see in the video are real prototypes that we have been developing for the past two years. Having worked closely with our factories throughout this entire design process, we feel comfortable in fulfilling an order of any size up to 5,000 units and fulfill at the end of November, but we will limit the production to 2,000 pairs for this first run so we can get them into your hands in time for winter.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPRODUCTION RISKS:\nEach of these final tests takes time, materials and human resources. We will be using the funds raised on Kickstarter to expedite this process, so that your shoes will be in your hands by the Winter. \n\nOnce the project closes, we will be able to put together our material orders and prep the factory immediately thereafter. That means we should be shipping from China direct to anywhere in the world by November 30, and your shoes should be in your hands fourteen days later. With your support, we can get these impossibly light boots on your feet.\n\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING RISKS:\nRegarding shipping, we have opted to offer THE ARGONAUT internationally. To our Kickstarters outside the US, we thank you for your support and would like to make sure you are aware of potential taxes and fees that will be placed on the shipment due to your country\u2019s customs law. \n\nThe $35 international shipping fee does not cover any of these taxes or fees, and is the responsibility of the recipient. Neither THE UT.LAB nor the international shipping carrier receives any amount of the potential fees our international backers may be charged.\n\nWe cannot declare the items as gifts as this puts your ARGONAUT at risk of seizure or confiscation. \n\nIf you have any questions concerns regarding this issue, please refer to your country\u2019s resources on Customs and Imports, and contact us here.\n\nWe are happy to talk about any of your initial questions and concerns regarding shipping or anything else regarding the project, and invite you to contact us before you back.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #5", "update_userinfo": "Argonaut Shipping 2014.12.17 - Happy New Year", "update_content": "Hello everyone,\nWe've been in the factory over the past week as we prep The Argonaut for shipment.

Thanks to our amazing backers who helped us reach our $15K goal! \nThat got us the funds to finish construction on our space so we can officially open our doors to our incredible community!\nThank you! Thank you! THANK YOU!!!\nBut... there's... more... More time, that is, to help us meet our 1st S-T-R-E-T-C-H goal of another $10K! Your maker love in the form of additional pledges will help us create a large door opening that'll allow for bigger projects & equipment to come in and out of the space, AND we'd like to install a computer server rack to equip our members with some awesome technology.  \nWe have until this Thursday evening at midnight... the Eve of Halloween!

(materials provided).\nBut also peek to your right for other NEWLY ADDED rewards!\n______________________\nHelp Kickstart Atlanta\u2019s first all-ages makerspace!\nLocated in Decatur, Ga., Decatur Makers is a place and community where people share tools, technology and know-how to tinker, invent, build and make cool stuff. \nIt began as the mad vision (mad, I tell you!) of a few, then became a grassroots movement. Now it\u2019s a bona fide building, partially outfitted and equipped. With a little help from you, this all-ages makerspace will be open \u2014 and making \u2014 by the end of the year. \nWe're just this happy! You can be too.\nFirst, a little context.  This will be quick.\nDecatur Makers is the collection of hackers, programmers, welders, carpenters, mechanics, artists, builders, designers, scientists, teachers, entrepreneurs, students, adults, kids, and seniors creating this makerspace. \nOur space is an unused gym at 605 W. Ponce de Leon Avenue, across from the Post Office, graciously provided to us by First Christian Church of Decatur. Inside, makers will destroy and create using an array of materials, from metal to microchips and tools ranging from woodworking equipment to 3-D printers to soldering irons and recycled art. \nAn initial fundraising effort enabled us to get the structure ready \u2013 replacing the roof, building out the interior, and adding little luxuries such as heating and air conditioning. The Kickstarter campaign will propel us to a point where all of the fundamentals are in place \u2014 and we can open a functional facility to the community.\nBzz Bzz busy as bees building out our space\nAs they say in the South\u2026 maybe elsewhere, too\u2026 if it\u2019s true, it ain\u2019t braggin\u2019\nAnd it IS true \u2013 the makerspace is a big deal for Decatur and the surrounding area. Here\u2019s why: \nIt connects a community, through physical space and shared knowledge. \nIt gives young people a reason to put down the device and pick up a skill. \nIt gives old people (not young like you!) a chance to learn and share. \nIt enhances the area\u2019s reputation as an inventive, what\u2019s-next community. \nIt\u2019s just cool \u2013 like, come on, where else would you go to build a robot, write an app, or create a movie?\nSo far, so many have given time, cash and love to this grassroots effort. Among them: the Decatur Education Foundation, the City of Decatur, the Downtown Development Authority \u2026 plus, many local businesses and individuals who\u2019ve generously shared their resources \u2026 and scores of volunteers who\u2019ve given talent and time. \nLots of all-ages folks are ready to start making\nSo, why a Kickstarter campaign?\nOur $15,000 goal will finish off two crucial areas \u2013 building construction and equipment. Some details:\nBuilding Construction ($5,000) \nComplete the construction of our woodworking shop and electronics room \nInstall a dust removal/ventilation system (to make the woodworking areas play nice with the rest of the building) \nInstall an RFID system to maximize the safety of this kid-friendly, all-ages environment, as well as keep track of tools and equipment.\nEquipment ($10,000)\nPurchase table saw (SawStop) for woodworking \nPurchase essential items for planning and collaborating (rolling workbenches, whiteboards, tables and chairs and AV equipment). \nAnd if we surpass the $15,000 goal, we only make Decatur Makers better.\nStretch Goal 1 (another $15,000) \nSecure servers to host virtual machines for programming projects, as well as to host databases and control systems for operating the space safely and securely\nAdd spot cooling to the computer server room\nComplete the next stage of the architectural plan: Open the front wall of the building for a level, wide-access entrance, so larger projects can be moved in and out. (Thinking big \u2026 literally!)\nStretch Goal 2 (another $20,000) \nBuild out our outdoor metalworking shop with welding equipment, a forge, and maybe even a plasma cutter!\nEnhance the machine shop with advanced CNC capabilities.\nNot in the Atlanta area? \nDecatur may not be the center of your universe, but maker love is worldwide. If you believe in what we\u2019re trying to achieve, consider gifting a membership to Decatur Makers or vouchers for classes to makers you know would appreciate it. Don't know anyone in our area?  We will make sure it goes to a deserving starving hacker, who will send you a heartfelt thank you.\nYou'll surely get a nice warm feeling inside, like using a power tool safely. Pay it forward!\nIn case you\u2019re insatiably curious about Decatur Makers\u2026\nDecatur Makers is taking a broad view of making to include both digital and traditional work. Project types will cover the spectrum \u2014 electronics, robotics, programming, 3D printing and other digital fabrication, as well as more traditional activities such as metalworking, woodworking, and arts and crafts. \nAn impressive tool collection is taking shape: A very nice table saw, a 12-watt laser cutter, a 3D printer (TAZ Lulzbot 2.0), a kiln, lots of small hand tools, some electronics kits, an analog oscilloscope, a vinyl cutter, underwater robots, etc. \nYou might identify with Decatur Makers\u2019 core values \u2014 Build. Share. Explore. \nBuild. People in our community create, tinker with, and invent things in both the physical and digital worlds. Our community is entrepreneurial and innovative. We want to invent new products and build small businesses. \nShare. We love to learn new things and teach people what we know. We share our knowledge with classes, intergenerational mentorships, and informal social collaborations. \nExplore. We are curious and creative. Sometimes what we make serves no practical purpose except the pleasure of creating. It may be art or just doing something for fun. We also want to explore and understand the world around us by using science, mathematics, engineering and technology.\nCool things we want to do once we have a space...\nWe want to do what our community wants to do! Deciding what we'll build, share and explore will be driven by our Decatur Makers members.\nThe scuttle-butt at our general meetings so far has been that scientists hope to begin working on bio-engineering projects, and our web designers look forward to having virtualization servers. Hackathons, TEDx nights, cos-play (costume construction), wearable technology, Franken-bike rebuilds, special effects movies, Fix-it Outreach events, programming apps, furniture construction, pottery, jewelry and art projects are all part of the discussion.\nDecatur and surrounding areas are already home to a thriving robotics community. More than a dozen FIRST Robotics teams, at different levels, are in various schools and homes. We'd love to be a resource for them as they build their competition 'bots and practice gracious professionalism!   \nDecatur Makers love to share what they know. We'll also be teaching an assortment of cool classes such as:\nFurniture Build with pallets: small groups guided in constructing beautiful rustic furniture from simple wooden pallets, working with our friends at the Lifecycle Building Center. \nLearn Arduino: step-by-step introduction to an entry level electronics microcontroller board. Control lights, sensors, motors, speakers, and learn to program them all. \nIntroduction to 3D printing: Create your own designs or explore collections online and print them in 3D. Make a replacement for that one little part you just can\u2019t find anywhere. \nMake your own vinyl stencil: Style and cut intricate vinyl stencils to create signs and banners. \nBuild a Tetrahedral Kite: Alexander Graham Bell\u2019s other clever work (in addition to the telephone) involved designing a kite that will fly despite it\u2019s massive size. Make a kite of your own. \nBuild a musical instrument: learn basic woodworking and apply the fundamentals of sound to make your own instrument. \nLED throwie: receive instruction in soldering techniques and hands-on direction on assembling a light-up toy.\nCool things we\u2019ve already done without a space\u2026\nWeb Maker Party 2014: Decatur Makers sponsored the Web Maker Party at the Decatur Recreation Center. Dozens of folks joined us who were interested in all things related to making on the web. There were several short presentations and small group workshops. \nDecatur Book Festival 2014: We partnered with Big Nerd Ranch and the Children\u2019s Museum of Atlanta to put on the Makers tent at this years Book Festival. Over two days, our program included bee keepers, whiskey distillery, home beer brewing, quilting, woodworking, the making of an iOS app, and more. Plus we helped the Little Shop of Stories convert a small bus into their bookmobile! \nDecatur Makers Community Meetings 2014: We gathered monthly as a community for any interested people to discover what we're about, get the latest news and ask questions. Then we broke into groups to brainstorm projects for us to showcase at the Atlanta Maker Faire 2014. Initially, we had to meet at the Decatur Recreation Center, but once our space was cleaned out, we began meeting in and around our space. Projects we're currently completing include building a Rubens tube, a couple of huge SOMA cubes, a human-sized foosball table, two cars for the Power Racing Series, and more. \nDecatur Arts Fest 2014: We put together 150 cubic foot cardboard boxes, painted and constructed a 22\u2019 x 11\u2019 puzzle of the City of Decatur logo\u2026 Minecraft-style! This maker project also involved some creative engineering. With native Decatur bamboo, cement, zip ties and duct tape, Decatur Makers crafted a clever, secure frame to hold this 3D build. A large bamboo hammock was also crafted to carry all those boxes from the Kids Arts Fest, where they had been prepared, to the Decatur Makers booth where the puzzle was completed. Thanks to the Decatur Arts Alliance for making this happen!\nDecatur Lantern Parade 2014: From brainstormed idea to completed project, our 15-foot Caterpillar Lantern transformation was a team effort. With a range of skill sets from lighting/electrical, structure design, and crafts, the Decatur Makers team launched this cool insect into a river of lighted art that was the Decatur Lantern Parade. \nPC Build Day 2014: A great turnout unfolded at the Decatur Recreation Center as we held a Build-A-PC class and unveiled our 3-D Printer. With people enjoying a chance to mingle with other local makers, several PCs were built from scratch and an octopus came to life on our 3D Printer (which we purchased, thanks to a \"beer grant\" from the Decatur Business Association).\nDesignorama 2014: We joined other STEAM (Science, Tech, Engineering, Arts, Math) groups showing kids at a local charter school science event how different items make different sounds when screaming from inside a balloon. \nCleanup Days 2014: Our first Cleanup Day had dozens of makers carrying out over a ton of garbage from inside our space, including loads of wall paneling. Others built a drain behind the building to help redirect water that was getting inside. The larger Decatur community also helped out as the City sent a sani crew and truck to haul stuff away. Other Work Days had folks putting up wall board, plumbing bathrooms, painting, working electrical, cleaning up brush and cutting limbs, digging a french drain, and more.\nAtlanta Science Festival 2014: We had the messiest booth in the Maker Village, as we showed kids of all ages how vibrations change our world with our dancing non-newtonian fluid on a speaker and screaming balloons filled with bolts. Thanks to the Arthur M. Blank Family Foundation for funding the maker area. \nDecatur Wine Festival 2013: The Decatur Makers brainstormed and created an enormous wooden structure that held almost a case of 4\u2019 tall blow-up wine bottles. This became the \u201cselfie spot\u201d of the Festival! Thanks to local support from The Imperial and the Decatur Arts Alliance for donating funds for materials. \nAtlanta Mini Maker Faire 2013: Our community built a non-newtonian liquid hopscotch course and a wine bottle cutter (that cut glass using hot and cold water). They also explored the science behind a theremin enhanced skeleton. \n Decatur Arts Fest 2013: We shared a booth with Decatur High School\u2019s robotics team, which showcased their robots while we shared the joy of building 3D origami flexagons.\nA little more on our smokin' hot rewards\n2-BIT LEVEL:\n$5 - ROUND OF APPLAUSE -- Can you hear us?

We believe that C-shirt is an experience its New, innovative, and Ultimately more useful then the normal T-shirt. What we've done is build a greater communication from designer to consumer, and consumer to consumer.\nC-shirt is not just for comic companies. We want to make C-shirt available for everyone to use in their own creative ways. We believe the idea is limitless. Therefore we want to see what others would use C-shirt for.

We have carefully thought out the plan. We will need high quality equipment that can produce at least 60,000 C-shirts a month.  Majority of the monies raised will be spent on the machines to run our manufacture. A good quality automatic screen printing machine can cost $25,000 and up. That\u2019s just the cost for one machine not including the supply list and actual location cost, which on average will cost $2,500 a month times 12 months ($30,000). Don\u2019t forget to factor in the cost of the shirts themselves, as they are made from scratch. \n$150,000, will allow us to purchase all equipment needed, lease location for 1 year, and achieve timely production on our first run of C-shirts.\nFrom there, the sky\u2019s the limit.

GEORGIA, ACHIEVES REDEMPTION ON A HERO QUEST VIA A MID-LIFE CRISIS THAT LANDS HIM IN BELLEVUE'S NOTORIOUS PSYCH WARD.  ALL WHILE HURRICANE SANDY RAGES THROUGH NEW YORK CITY.\nAbrons Arts Center and Mark Dendy Projects present Labyrinth, a new dance-play by Obie and Bessie Award-winning choreographer Mark Dendy. A tragicomic, autobiographically inspired retelling of the Theseus myth, Dendy\u2019s Labyrinth is set in present-day New York City and performed by a cast of four in multiple roles.\nPerformances run October 9\u201312 (Thursday\u2013Saturday at 8pm, Sunday at 5pm) and October 15\u201326 (Wednesday\u2013Saturday at 8pm, Sunday at 5pm), at Abrons Arts Center\u2019s Underground Theater.\nIn Labyrinth, Dendy interweaves character portraiture, myth, autobiography, and fantasy. Set in New York City, with Theseus hailing from Athens, Georgia, and aided by a transgender Ariadne, the hero quest is given a picaresque spin. En route to choreograph a Rockettes number, an artistically conflicted Theseus washes down anti-anxiety pills with Absinthe just as Super-storm Sandy is approaching the city. His journey through the mythic labyrinth is peopled with a Jungian underworld of colorful, disenfranchised characters, and pits him against multiple forces including a mechanical bull at the Bellevue Psych Ward. With Dendy\u2019s signature wit, intense physicality, and searing social commentary, Labyrinth explores a world of inner demons and, ultimately, redemption by way of midlife crisis. The play is performed by Mark Dendy, Heather Christian, Stephen Donovan, and Matthew Hardy, with sound, music, and video created live on stage by the performers amid an ever-changing set of found objects.\nPhoto by Marisa @RockPaper\nWe have been working on Labyrinth for over three years and are now in our final weeks of rehearsal culminating in an October 9th premiere. During those years we have worked with a group of very talented performers during the development of this piece. Our newest addition is Heather Christian who will be performing original music live. We need your support to pay for a performers fees, a sound designer, a sound mixer, a technical director and a production assistant. Mounting a three week run in New York City is filled with financial challenges that include finding appropriate rehearsal space, hiring an expert technical crew that is costly and paying professional level fees to the performers. A press agent must also be engaged at a considerable fee as well promotional materials, sets, props, costumes, video equipment and designer fees. We receive the box office receipts but this projected figure combined with our private and public donations still requires $14,000 to be raised to cover all costs. We need your support!\nReturning to MYTH is important in our culture because it is ancient. It lives in our bones and in our collective subconscious and is governed by universal laws. We're so outwardly focused in our culture - spread out horizontally - for instance the way the internet connects us but focuses us outward - and across time and space. We then need verticality to balance that - a verticality that goes deep and MYTH is that depth for me.\nThe hero quest is big picture stuff and we are each one of us on a hero quest to conquer our demons and experience redemption. Experiencing a post modern mythic ritual centers us and brings us closer to home in our selves and as a collective.\nPhoto by Marisa @RockPaper\nLabyrinth is Written, Directed and Choreographed by Mark Dendy                                                        \nOriginal Music by Heather Christian                                                         \nLyrics by Heather Christian and Mark Dendy                                     \nLighting Design by Jay Ryan                                                                        \nVideo, Set, and Costume design by Stephen Donovan                                  \nSound Design by Stowe Nelson\nDramaturgy by Tom Cole \nTechnical Artist Dave Pelato\nAudio Engineer Erik Skovgaard\nWig Designer Torin\nFight Director Bryce Bermingham\nProduction Assistant Eli Mendoza\nPress Agent Janet Stapleton\nCast                                                                                                           \nMark Dendy - Theseus/Princess Pawnie Ariadne/Hannah/Daddy      \nHeather Christian - Still Small Voice/Night Club Singer/Gaia/Therapist\nStephen Donovan - The Shadow                                                          \nMatthew Hardy - The Dark Companion/Bartender/Preacher/Gardener\nLabyrinth was developed over the last two years at residencies and workshop performances in New York City at The Actors Fund Arts Center, DANCENOW at Joe's Pub, Danspace Project, Dixon Place, Dance From The Heart 2013: DRA at Cedar Lake Theatre, New Work/New York at Parkside Lounge, and at Barking Legs Dance Theater in Chattanooga, TN, Dance Place in Washington, D.C., and DANCENOW Silo in Bucks County, PA.\nTickets are $25 and are available through Abrons Arts Center\u2019s box office at (212) 352-3101, or online at www.abronsartscenter.org.

He rededicated himself to a daily physical practice in the studio, studied yoga and body mind centering. He rediscovered skeletal, deep tissue and release movement and began an exploration of gesture both in the abstract and as character driven. He has become increasingly interested in utilizing and juxtaposing seemingly disparate aesthetics to achieve a paradoxical whole, thereby assigning dramaturgical meaning to techniques that are normally viewed as totally abstract. Mark's current approach is a holistic one, focused not just on the work, but the life that is making it. Mark's work in politics, social justice and for the environment informs his work today. His work provides a window through which others may observe and participate in a challenge to current social norms with a focus on the gentrification of the artist in an age of too much information, too much technology, and not enough focus on the environment. Dendy's work is a personal dance theatre of corrosive satire, gender politics, OCCUPY sentiment and movement invention. His aesthetic embraces cabaret, drag, post-modern deconstruction, and a parody of show business and dance history. Mark is interested in a non-linear narrative construct informed by psychology; with emphasis on the dramaturgical empathic relationship between human beings as the \"age of the individual\" wanes.\nBryce Bermingham  has choreographed the violence for musicals such as a national tour of The Scarlet Pimpernel, Beauty and the Beast and George Stiles\u2019 The Three Musketeers and well as dozens of Shakespeare and modern theatre works.

I'm Christian Picciolini. Thanks for checking out the Kickstarter campaign for my first book, Romantic Violence: Memoirs of an American Skinhead. It means everything to me that you're here. Please read on.\nI've spent a significant part of the last six years recalling, condensing, and writing about a period in my life that I'd rather forget. But I won't soon forget it. Not in this lifetime anyways. I certainly have a lot to be thankful for, but I can't rest until I've pulled out all the poisonous weeds that have sprung from seeds I scattered many years ago. Here's my story...\nMy memoir, Romantic Violence, chronicles both my early childhood as I try to find a place to fit in as a first generation American, and my life as a former neo-Nazi skinhead leader, where in my youthful ignorance, I thought I had finally found a place to belong.\nMy young parents both arrived in the United States from Italy in the late-1960s and settled with their families in the same area in suburban Chicago. Neither spoke English. My mother was so severely criticized for her foreign ways that she dropped out of high school. My father, while more adaptable to a new culture, still spent most of his time with other immigrants. They met on a blind date and pleased both families when they announced their engagement and were married soon after.\nWhen my mother became pregnant with me, my parents wanted to ensure their child had all the advantages of a typical American boy, so they moved to a non-Italian neighborhood. When I was in first grade, they enrolled me in a Catholic school full of kids from white upper middle class homes. To provide this lifestyle for me, they worked long hours, which meant they weren\u2019t home much. I spent every day, including weekends, with my grandparents in working class Blue Island, a South Chicago suburb with a neighborhood populated almost exclusively by Italian immigrants. My early childhood years were steeped in old world traditions, despite my parents\u2019 efforts to make me an all-American boy.\nWhile these early years in a working class Italian neighborhood made me sensitive to the hardships of non-native born Americans, at the age of 14, I became enamored by Clark Martell, the very first\u2014and most infamous\u2014neo-Nazi skinhead in the United States. Determined to be just like him, I spent the next eight years of my life rising through the ranks of the world's most violent white supremacist organization. I was the founder and lead singer of the first American skinhead band to ever play in Europe.\nFor nearly a decade, I traveled throughout the Midwest and South spreading the racist message that the white race was in peril. I marched with the KKK, instigated hate crimes, and had an arsenal of weapons in preparation of overthrowing our government, which I was certain must occur if the white race was to be saved from annihilation. I was kicked out of every high school I attended; yet I also got good grades, was the captain of my high school\u2019s football team, and was well-respected by the adults in my neighborhood. The FBI showed up at my wedding to see who the attendees were. Moammar Khadafi wanted to form an alliance with me. \nI paid a high price for my skinhead involvement and constantly battled building doubts about the poisonous ideals I held for the seven years I was a racist. It wasn't until after a few years of marriage to a woman I deeply loved, my wife divorced me, taking our two young sons with her. I realized at that point that my hateful beliefs were destroying me and I finally found the courage to leave them behind. In my twenties, after much soul searching, I found my way into an excellent job at IBM, took advantage of their education benefits, and earned a degree in international business/international relations from DePaul University, earning a 3.98 GPA. While attending DePaul University I was part of a United Nations conference focused on the Millennium Development Goals, and the importance of helping others became the focus of my world. \nBut the effects of my skinhead years were not behind me. In 2004, my only sibling\u2014a brother 10 years my junior\u2014was violently attacked by a black gang member. Family and friends feared my racism would resurface, and I would seek revenge.\nNothing was less likely to happen. My actions had been at least partially responsible for my brother\u2019s problem, who had tried to emulate me by leading the life of an outlaw.\nI've since gone on to do some positive things with my life and am thankful for those compassionate ones who I've been lucky to meet along my journey. I was humbled to co-found an organization in 2009 dedicated to promoting basic human goodness and helping others discover the beauty of diversity. The non-profit is called Life After Hate.\n***If you'd like to read a preview of some of the chapters of Romantic Violence: Memoirs of an American Skinhead, download a PDF here.\nTHE BOOK IS FULLY WRITTEN AND JUST ABOUT DONE, BUT YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS CAMPAIGN GETS IT PUBLISHED AND DISTRIBUTED.\nMy goal is to release the book in early 2015. I have been writing this book at night and on the weekends for the last 6 years--since January 2008. It's just about ready to publish, but I need your assistance with financing the final edit and publishing and getting to the finish line.\nIf you are able to pledge some money to help fund this project, know that I am forever grateful. If you can't afford it or just don't want to, I completely understand. Please support the campaign by sharing the video or link to this page. I'm thankful for that too. I already consider myself lucky to have gotten this far and to think we can fund this together as a community is even more exciting. The future looks bright, thanks to your continued support.\n'So... Where's My Money Going?'\nYour generous pledges will go to the printing, copy editing, design, and distribution of the book, as well as page formatting of the print and digital versions. The goal is to have an April/May 2015 book launch. Here's the breakdown of how I'd allocate the pledges:\nCopy Editing & Proofreading: While I feel that I've written a powerful and eloquent manuscript, the final step is always to get a professional copy editor and proofreader to give it a final once over before going to print. This will ensure another set of eyes so I can get this to you perfectly. Harvard commas and all.\nPrint Layout Formatting: Both the hardcover and softcover need to be laid out onto differently formatted print templates, not to mention 3 different versions for ebooks.\nCover Designer: From my days working at Threadless and in the arts, I've been lucky to meet a ton of amazing artists from all over the world. I'd like to ask one of them to help design the book jacket.\nPublishing: This is the most significant bulk cost of the budget. It's also hard to estimate because it really depends on how many of you help kickstart it. Paying to manufacture the books is about half the budget.\nDistribution: This is probably the smallest line item in the budget, but there nonetheless. Amazon.com, iTunes, and copyright registration costs pertain here.\nRewards: I wanted to mark this milestone with some special rewards for all you generous campaign donors. Aside from the actual, physical books (and handmade bookmarks), there are also mailing boxes, packing tape, and a hefty amount of postage/shipping costs.\nKickstarter: They take 5% off the total amount raised.\nBased on your level of support, there are all sorts of different gifts in store for you. All pledges will receive some sort of reward, whether it is a copy of the book, a personal visit, an ebook, an illustrated appearance in my next book, or merely good karma.\nPlease remember how Kickstarter works: if we're even a dollar short of our goal, the project does NOT get funded. So, even a dollar helps. Even if we achieve the full amount before the campaign ends, some people might not be able to fulfill their pledge. That means we need a comfortable margin. If we blow through the number, that just means there will be budget for me to send more books to libraries and schools across the country (and world). I'll also unlock some more fun and personal rewards if we exceed the initial goal.\nStretch Goals: Help Unlock New Rewards!\nI'd love for more people to be part of this adventure. If you help me raise the following amounts, above and beyond our goal, I'll also unlock some fun, new rewards:\nIf we raise $15,000 - I will send one free copy of the book to each of the 79 Chicago public libraries, so that those who might need access to my story can learn from my journey. I will also upgrade every single backer over $25 to receive an amazing #MakeGoodHappen art piece by Matthew Hoffman, the artist behind the You Are Beautiful stickers you see all over the world.\nIf we raise $25,000 - I will send one free copy of the book to each of the 642 Illinois public libraries and 198 college and university libraries in Illinois, so that those who might need access to my story can learn from my journey.\nIf we raise $50,000 - I will release the ebook for free for the whole world to download it forever.\nIf we raise $100,000 or more, I will send one copy of the book to every public library in the United States. That's over 16,000 libraries! I will also personally start a $10,000 Scholarship Fund and identify five deserving \"at risk\" youths to each receive $2,000 towards their education.

The fact that you knowingly chose to take time out of your life to read something I wrote about a very dark period of my life makes all of this a worthwhile, strange, and touching experience. That makes you the best humans around.\nI hope to continue to tell people about what I've learned from my experiences for as long as I can, whether it be about the mistakes I've made, the compassion I've received, or the knowledge that there are other paths available. There are lots of us out there (Frank Meeink, Angela King, Tony McAleer, Arno Michaelis, Timothy Zaal, TJ Leyden, Sammy Rangel) doing good and so many more looking for a way out. Be good to each other.\nIgnorance breeds fear. Fear manifests as hate. Hate is therefore countered by knowledge. Learn from my journey.

I\u2019m designing it in an 8.5\u201d x 12\u201d format to place on your coffee table, so that when friends come over waiting for the game to start or the pizza to arrive, they begin casually leafing through the book, and start to laugh. It\u2019s fun for all ages, and I need your help to make it happen. \nThe pages in the book will have a full bleed illustration on the even pages with an explanation title, poem and repeat illustration on the back.\nPunnies all started with a Catfish.  When I work on storyboarding for animation, I regularly take a breather and create silly watercolor paintings (check out the rest of my stuff at http://www.llynsplace.com).  When I decided to do a cat as a fish chasing his dinner \u2013 Catfish \u2013 I just couldn\u2019t stop.  I have been selling prints of these images at conventions for several years now along with my \u201cLittle Monster\u201d books, but with my publishing in general, distribution has been a tough nut to crack.  Getting the books I wish to create into the hands of the people I know would love them has been very difficult when you are the illustrator, writer, designer, and publisher and salesman (not to mention, I work full-time creating cartoons, like Pinky and the Brain, Animaniacs, Aladdin, Kim Possible, Earthworm Jim, and Curious George) this can be a daunting task.  Help me create this book the way it needs to be done, while getting it to someone like you who will love it. And, if this Kickstarter works, I will be turned into a publishing fiend!  I have so many books I want to create, especially in the pun department.  Please get me started \u2013 I promise if we do this together I will not stop.\nNote I\u2019m planning the delivery date for February (and I mean the begging of February) for next year \u2013 so you can give it to your honey as a low calorie Valentine Day present instead of that box of chocolates.\nMy Project:  A full color book 48 \u2013 64 (and beyond depending on you) page, 8.5\u201cx12\u201d hardcover book of visual puns.  The even pages will contain a full bleed illustration of the pun while the reverse will have the name of the pun (since you might not be able to figure it out) along with a silly poem to explain it.  The entire book is my creation: illustrations, writing and design, yours truly, Llyn Hunter.\nWho is it for? Everyone!  I create my books to be read and loved by kids and adults alike, while this book is especially great for those evil punsters who we all know and adore.\nWhat\u2019s in it?  My highly detailed watercolor illustrations and well-written silly pomes.  Seriously, I write fun stuff.  I hate tripping over bad meter, so I don\u2019t write it. I can promise you will enjoy the writing almost as much artwork.\nWhy?  Because I love to make people smile.  It\u2019s such a high to able to watch someone try to figure out a pun and then watch the \u201clight bulb\u201d go on with a laugh or a giggle when they figure it out.  I would like to be able to share that kind of joy with as many people as I can.  It\u2019s just too much fun.\nWhat happens if we make the goal?  Here\u2019s the cool part.  If I make the goal, and we go beyond I will add additional pages and additional puns.

This has been a decade long project when I started teaching my kid the script. In 2009, I started doing cultural festivals in the San Francisco Bay Area where worksheets kids can get exposure of the script by coloring words and the characters. I've also had other kid related activities from art, writing workshops and toy shows at various festivals, the Asian Art Museum, Sama Sama Coop and the Philippine Embassy in Belgium. \n\nSo why a coloring book? Everyone starts out as an artist. As children, it's one of the first things we do to express ourselves and be creative. As we get older, we're trained to loose that self-expression and creativity. By the time we get to adulthood, it's mostly gone. This project allows one to rediscover that inner child in them. Explore something new. Start a legacy for your kids, future kids and the community.\n\nWebsite: Kulay.Baybayin.com\n\nTHE PROJECT \nThis 8\"x10\" 40 page book has each of the 17 characters of the script that can be colored along with a page where one can practice writing. Also included is a basic overview of the writing system rules. Once launched, each purchaser of the workbook will receive a PDF (no DRM) copy that can be printed again and again. I'm also currently in talks with a few non-profit organizations and schools to use Kulay. There will be no cost to them. All copies will be donated. \nPrototype\nFinal copy\nBasic rules of the script\n17 characters\nTHE MONEY\nMoney will be used to cover the initial bulk order and promotional expenses for the launch. \n\nTHE LAUNCH\nKulay : Baybayin will be launched October 4 at the 23rd Annual Festival of Philippine Art & Culture at Grand Park in Los Angeles, California. See FilamArts.org for more info on the festival. \n\nABOUT ME\nKristian Kabuay was born in the Philippines and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. He spent his college years in the Philippines where he honed his knowledge about the native ancient writing system, Baybayin. Kristian is a self-taught artist influenced by calligraphy, graffiti, abstract art, indigenous culture, technology and Asian writing systems. As a leading authority for the propagation and instruction of the Philippine script, he developed a modern performance style of the writing system called Tulang Kalis (Poetry of the Sword) and introduced it as Filipino Calligraphy with a series of live demonstrations and lectures at the Asian Art Museum in October 2012. He has spoken at numerous schools and institutions such as Stanford University, UC Berkeley, SF State University, UC Davis, Sonoma State, University of the Philippines, National Anthropology Museum of Madrid, Tokyo University, and the San Francisco Philippine Consulate. Currently based in San Francisco, Kristian has been tirelessly advocating a reawakening of the indigenous spirit through decolonization and Baybayin. Conscious about the role he plays, Kristian launched his own company around the script specializing custom art, translations, books and apparel. This lead to collaborations with t-shirt, hat and skateboard companies.

The duty was first deligated to the loggers wives, to go in and replant the seedlings where the clearcuts had taken place. After this proved insufficiant, forestry companies started offering up reforesting contracts and in the 70's groups of young hippies took those contracts and started treeplanting.They hauled in all supplies needed to sustain weeks and months at a time, setting up primative camping sites on location of the planting.\nI was born in a teepee on a sandbar 11 miles up the Kingcome river on the west coast of British Columbia. It was the first treeplanting contract my parents were hired for, they were 19 and 20 years old at the time. My dad, Daniel James, delivered me into his dirty hands and my mother, Jenny, was back planting within a few days. Those were the days... \nA few years ago I was looking for a photographs of myself as a child to show my young daughter. I asked my dad if he had any, to which he answered by dropping off a large bag full of trays and trays of slides that he shot while during his treeplanting contractor days in the 70's and 80's. Most of my time spent in camps were warm fuzzy memories of dogs, riding in the back of trucks, sleeping in tree boxes, stealing mouthfuls of icing while the cooks weren't looking, late night fires and early morning rain. When I scanned the slides, it was apparent that my dad had a full documentation of life in his camps. Over the last year I have been sorting through his slides and posting them on Instagram @nahannireforestation.\n Now I am hoping to make a book.\nThe teepee I was born in\ndad\nme\nBig Al and uncle Trevor\nBute Inlet, 1977\nNahanni Reforestation tee\nNahanni Reforestation Sweatshirt\n The money raised from this Kickstarter will directly fund the first edition publication of this book.

Even though this is a collective work, each page and image presents a unique view from the illustration community, and reveals something of the heart and mind of the artist. Illustration can take many forms; it has an ability to transform a page and can add magic to words to present what simple text might imply, but can not say.\nThe primary goal is to raise funds to publish the limited edition Practice Makes Perfect: A Botanical Illustration Sketchbook. It is an art book of 76 illustrations made by 16 instructors and 60 artists from the School of Botanical Art and Illustration at Denver Botanic Gardens. It celebrates the program\u2019s 34th anniversary and its restructuring as the School of Botanical Art and Illustration. The project is loosely based on the Sketchtravel project founded in Paris in 2006 when Gerald Guerlais and Daisuke Dice Tsusfumi created a book that traveled from hand to hand among 71 artists all over the globe. Our own sketchbook project was completed in one year with participants from the Gardens\u2019 botanical illustration community, including international artists. \nAn original, handmade 160-page springback bound book with 90 lb. Fabriano Artistico HP watercolor paper and protective reindeer-leather box was made for this purpose. Each of the artists had one 11\u201dx 7.5\u201d page to use and up to one week to complete their work. This book was never mailed, but traveled from hand to hand within the community for 365 days. Practice Makes Perfect: A Botanical Illustration Sketchbook showcases a unique collection of talent and expertise, including natural science illustrations, artistic explorations and calligraphy with a personal touch. It includes a foreword by Dr. Shirley Sherwood O.B.E., Kew, U.K. and 76 full color illustrations, each presenting insight into the artist's way of working.\nRandom selection of pages from the book:\n (Ann Swan)                                                    (Constance Sayas)\n (Beatrice Coron)                                             (Susan Stutzman)\n (Barbara McKee)                                            (Annie Reiser)\n (Emma Felt)                                                   (Sendy Issanti)\n (Judy Vanderbosch)                                       (Cynthia Rothbard)\n  (Lauren Bassing)                                           (Susan DiMarchi)\n  (Sarah Homfray)                                             (Karen Cleaver)\n (Veiko Kespersaks)                                        (Karla Beatty)\n(Jessy Bergeman)\nContributing Artists:\nKarla Beatty, Boston, MA; Beatrice Coron, NY, NY; Susan DiMarchi, , Denver, CO; Sarah Homfray, U.K; Mervi Hjelmroos-Koski, Lafayette, CO; Renee Jorgensen, Lakewood, CO; Ikumi Kayama, College Park, MD; Veiko Kespersaks, London, U.K.; Libby Kyer, Denver, CO; Jenny Phillips, Melbourne, Australia; Lauren Pierson, Denver, CO; Randy Raak, Golden, CO; Annie Reiser, Estes Park, CO; Susan Rubin, Denver, CO; Constance Sayas, Denver, CO; Ann Swan, Rowde, U.K.  - Maria Bumgarner, Denver, CO; Lauren Bassing, Lebanon, NH; Jesse Bergeman, Denver, CO; Michele Bloom, Denver, CO; Leslie Boose, Englewood, CO; Nels Broste, Fort Collins, CO; Cindy Calkins, Aurora, CO; Karen Cleaver, Littleton, CO; Hayley Cook, Denver, CO; Rebecca Corbett, Denver, CO; Lauren Cotie, Denver, CO; Susan Curnutte, Colorado Springs, CO; Shanelle Deater, Aurora, CO; Estelle DeRidder, La Crescenta, CA; Susan Dorsey, Broomfield, CO; Emerson Easley, Saga, Japan; Teri Eichhorn, Ramona, CA; Laura Farnsworth, Denver, CO; Emma Felt, Santa Fe, NM; Meredith Feniak, Denver, CO; Carol Ferguson, Aurora, CO; Linda Forbess, Schofield, WI; Karen Genoff-Campbell, Greely, CO; Noreen Goetz, Aurora, CO; Megan Maksimovich Goodenough, Fort Collins, CO (label calligraphy); Rebecca Hall, Parker, CO; Erin Haley, Denver, CO; Jan Boyd Haring, Cascade, CO; Helen Hasting, Morrison, CO; Marj Hopkins, Colorado Springs, CO; Christina Hubbell, Colorado Springs, CO; Dawn Huston, Colorado Springs, CO; Diane Inman, Corrales, NM; Sendy Issanti, Calgary, Alberta, Canada ; Margaret Johnson, Boulder, CO; Vanessa Martin, Aurora, CO; Judy Matthews, Fort Collins, CO; Karen May, Erie, CO; Douglas McCallum, Longmont, CO; Mary McCauley, Fort Collins, CO; Elizabeth McCauley, Fort Collins, CO; Kathy McCrery, Galesburg, IL; Barbara McKee, Louisville, CO; Martha Narey, Denver, CO; Peter Orleans, Denver, CO; Carla Pawlewicz, Lakewood, CO; Alice Pearson, Greenwood Village, CO; Kirk Pfeffer, Broomfield, CO; Cynthia Rothbard, Nokomis, FL; Jaclyn Sachleben, Richmond, VA; Helen Smithwick,  Colorado Springs, CO; Irma Sturgell, Centennial, CO; Susan Stutzman, Golden, CO; Lesley Switendick, Boulder, CO; Mary Tharp, Arvada, CO; Angela Tingle, Buena Vista, CO; Karen Tillou, Oregon City, OR; Judy Vanderbosch, Denver, CO; Vickey Wood, Highlands Ranch, CO; Megan Wyeth, Saint Joseph, MO; Penelope Yerigan, Littleton, CO.\nBudget:\nThe secondary goal of this Kickstarter is to receive funds to establish an Illustrator/Artist in Residence Program at Denver Botanic Gardens School of Botanical Art and Illustration. \nThis is an exciting annual opportunity for up to three illustrators to get involved in the daily happenings at the Gardens, each for a six-week period of time (mid-April to end of May; June to mid-July and August to mid-September).

Climate Summit, we immediately knew we wanted to help.\nIn that spirit, we\u2019ve decided to erect a temporary monument in lower Manhattan during the Climate March.\nThis is our third Kickstarter project.\nWe're asking you to join us and help make an important art work addressing the impact of global warming and its effects on life on earth.\nWe\u2019ve been making temporary monuments and inserting them into major political events since 2006. These sculptures galvanize opinion to create a platform around significant issues. They're dynamic monuments that draw the public in and set the stage for involvement.\nOur temporary monuments are text-based sculptures carved from solid blocks of ice. They're set up on pedestals and illuminated by light boxes to punctuate important dates and locations.\nWe film them disappearing.\nWe melted down Democracy on the third anniversary of the Iraq War and reprised it for the poltical conventions in 2008 in Denver and St. Paul.\nWe melted down the Economy in lower Manhattan on the 79th anniversary of the Great Depression.\nAnd we melted the Middle Class in Tampa and Charlotte during the conventions in 2012. (Our second Kickstarter project.)\nNow we\u2019re melting down The Future in New York City.\nBecause if the world\u2019s leaders at the Climate Summit don\u2019t take action, there may not be much of one left.\nThe U.N. Climate Summit is one of the most important events on global warming to date and this is going to be one of the strongest temporary monuments we\u2019ve ever made.\nWe're coordinating this with 350.org  \u2013 they\u2019re as enthusiastic and excited as we are - and we're also involved with other artists and activists planning to participate at the People\u2019s Climate March.\nWe call our project Dawn of the Anthropocene, which is a term scientists use to call the age we\u2019re living in, when the power of humans is greater than that of nature\u2019s.\nThis is how we make them:\nFirst we carve it. We\u2019re working with Shintaro Okamoto. This is the fourth ice sculpture we\u2019ve made with him.\nWe\u2019re privileged to have worked with his father Takeo on earlier ones. He was a master carver cuting the letters from blocks of special ice by hand. An entire word can weigh 2000 or more pounds.\nOn the day of our event, Shintaro, his assistants and we will install the ice words on location, where we also set up cameras to film the sculptures as they disintegrate.\nIt can take anywhere from 4 to 24 hours to melt away. We\u2019re constantly documenting the entire process and make the media available on our website meltedaway.com.\nEqually important is the location, we\u2019re installing it in Flat Iron North Plaza at the intersection of Broadway and Fifth Avenue on 23 Street. This is a long and complicated process. Some cities require extensive permits, others not. From our experience New York is somewhere in between. We're currently fine tuning the date of the event; it will be either September 21 or 23. (Stay tuned.)\nOne of the great aspects about this sculpture is its material presence as it transforms from a solid state to liquid. The idea is clear and people on site really connect with it. All of these components (sculpture, location, date of event, media and internet) and the interaction with the public make up a social sculpture.\nThat's just some of the nuts and bolts.\nBut we definitely can't realize this project without your support:\nTo help pay for our location permit\nTo fund the video documentation and streaming\nTo pay for finishing the project website\nTo hire assistants on the day of the event\nAnd to pay for 4 more letters.\nAnd most importantly, we need to make this project have as big an impact as possible through you. You can be a part of the action by mentioning it on as many blogs, tweets, and social media sites as possible.\nTogether we can make a public intervention to address global warming.\nBefore we forget, here are some incentives available as a thank you for your support:\n-- Postcard of the sculpture and a desktop image you can download\n-- MP3 recording of what the Future disappearing sounds like \u2013 location recording of ice letters breaking \u2013 link below is the 2012 Middle Class ice sculpture in Tampa\n-- Dough-Yo's and Po-Yo's - Gold Standards in YoYo's\nDough-Yo\nPo-Yo\n-- The famous F**K snow globe\n-- Over/Sight, our newest limited edition lenticular 2014 (ed. 100),\n-- And for the ultimate sponsorship, if you back an ice letter, we'll send you a signed and numbered digital print of the sculpture on location from the event.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMelting down the Future is a cool idea, but it's really a serious issue - and presents many challenges.\n\nConceptually, it's really hard - what does it mean to meltdown the future? That's pretty heavy.\n\nBesides that, we still face potential glitches - our permit is in the approval stages, will it be granted?\n\nHow smoothly will the set up go? Will the streaming work? What if it goes down during the event?\n\nBut most of all, one of the biggest lessons and one of the biggest surprises - is just how private public space actually is.\n\nDid you know that the Flat Iron building licenses its image? What happens when it's in a background? We're working on that.

The first Cocoon was created in the Tlatelolco neighborhood of Mexico City in 2010, in the plaza where the Aztec lost their final battle against the Spanish, and government forces massacred a still-unknown number of people at a democracy protest in 1968. I built a COCOON in Greenwood, a small town in the Mississippi Delta that was a cotton capital both before and after the Civil War, and the scene of intense Civil Rights organizing during 1960's. In 2012, I created a COCOON in the state\u2019s capital, Jackson, in the Mississippi Museum of Art\u2019s new public art garden that sits on the site of a former bus station where Freedom Riders were arrested in 1961.\nCOCOON in Tlatelolco, Mexico City.\nIn all the locations I collaborate with local people who, in addition to building the large COCOON, also create a little cocoon from the everyday things that they might find in their purse or pocket. I interview and record each participant about what their cocoon represents. Their recorded testimony is heard inside the finished sculpture. COCOON culminates when participants carry the skin in a ceremonial procession that starts at a historic location, passes communal memory points, and ends at the COCOON site. There participants wrap the COCOON skeleton with the skin completing the sculpture. That same evening COCOON is illuminated and their voices heard.      \nCOCOON in Greenwood, Mississippi.\nSupport COCOON Goutte d\u2019Or\nAfter two years of field organizing and little cocoon workshops in Goutte d\u2019Or, in which over 300 local people participated, I am now preparing for the artwork\u2019s final phase, the four-week build this fall, and the procession and illumination of the sculpture on October 4, 2014.\nCOCOON Goutte d\u2019Or is a joint production between COCOON by Kate Browne and GFR - le Collectif, a French association in the neighborhood. Our support comes from foundations, government agencies, neighborhood associations, and the individuals who attended our COCOON benefit. These generous contributions helped fund local field organizers, a youth core build team, workshops, housing, airfares, a South Bronx-Goutte d\u2019Or student exchange, and provided links to hundreds of local residents. There is a list of our funders and local partners below. I am eternally grateful to them all.\nNow I need your help. Your contribution to my Kickstarter campaign will make COCOON in Goutte d\u2019Or possible. Your contributions will go towards materials, equipment, security, expenses and to link past COCOONS to present by bringing two people, a core team member and field organizer, from COCOON Jackson to work and have an exchange with local people in building the Goutte d\u2019Or COCOON in Paris.\nWith your help for a few days and nights COCOON can hold the past, present, and future in one place.\nWhy the Goutte d'Or?\nThe Goutte d\u2019Or is located in the 18th arrondissement, just east of Montmartre. The neighborhood has a long history as a destination for immigrants from North and West African nations. Today the neighborhood is also a waypoint for people traveling without papers, trying to make it from somewhere else, often Eastern Europe, to other places in Europe or the United States. Certain parts of the Goutte d\u2019Or are routinely patrolled by national riot police. As in nearby suburbs, the residents and police sporadically clash in small and occasionally larger confrontations. The Goutte d\u2019Or has a vibrant and strong civil society with a powerful network of associations, shops, religious organizations, schools, libraries, cafes and artists. \n\nI have been working with local field organizers, neighborhood associations, and residents in the Goutte d\u2019Or. With their help I have reached out to hundreds of local people through little cocoon workshops.\n\nBuilding the Large COCOON in Paris \nThe culmination of COCOON in the Goutte d\u2019Or will take place in fall 2014, with a four-week build in the neighborhood. The COCOON represents the people and the place where it is built. We will build the skeleton of the COCOON using local Ailanthus altissima saplings, an invasive species in France.\n\nAilanthus altissima, an invasive species.\nThe skeleton will be 24 X 10\u2019 (8 X 3m) and look similar to the COCOON skeleton below.\nCOCOON skeleton in Jackson, Mississippi.\nThe Skin\nParticipants will weave the COCOON skin using Ailanthus altissima branches fastened with African fabric scraps from local tailors and designers.\n\nWeaving a skin panel, banana leaf veins fastened with packing tape, Tlatelolco, Mexico City.\nThe Procession: When Skin Walks With Memory\nWhen Skin Walks With Memory is a silent performance where participants can acknowledge and symbolically bring their past, present and future to the artwork. The procession will be free from religious or cultural meanings but scripted to create positive interactions between diverse populations.\n\nI script the procession by creating storyboards.\nTwo Storyboard panels from Kate Browne\u2019s \u201cWhen Skin Walks with Memory\u201d COCOON Goutte d\u2019Or, Paris.\n  Each participant wears a light and carries a skin panel to the skeleton in Square L\u00e9on. There they will wrap the skeleton with the skin enclosing the little cocoons.\nThe procession in Jackson, Mississippi.\nThe skin will be carried to the skeleton through the streets of the Goutte d\u2019Or on October 4, 2014.  The procession will begin in the early evening at the Charles de Gaulle airport, travel by the RER B train making stops in the Paris suburbs to arrive at Gare du Nord at 7:30pm, then enter the Goutte d\u2019Or neighborhood and end in Square L\u00e9on after dark. \nCore Build Team and field organizer coordinating the evening procession in Jackson, MS.\nWhat's inside the COCOON?\nLittle Cocoons and recorded testimony\nWhile the large COCOON serves as a physical representation of the people and place where it is built, I work with participants to create little cocoons that represent the individual voices within the neighborhood.  I help sort their everyday objects to find those that are symbolic to them.  In this process I take people on a journey through their unconscious enabling them to discover the stories, wishes, dreams and memories their cocoon represents. \n\nLittle cocoons.\nTestimonies\n\nOnce participants build their own little cocoon, an allegory for revisiting distant memories and defining hopes for the future, I interview and record each person's thoughts on what their cocoon means to them.  An example of two participants testimonies can be seen below. \n\n\"The cup is in the shape of a home which represents my home in the Dominican Republic, the glass represents my eyes looking through.  The candy, my mother's sweetness.  The wrapper is bright like she is.  She is brilliant.  My wish is to live where she is back in the Dominican Republic.\"\n\"Yes, the ocean.  Oh Lord, the beaches.  It's all blue skies, blue water.  Algeria.  It's in Kabylie. B\u00e9ja\u00efa.\"\nThe Illumination\nAs people walk through the illuminated COCOON they pass by hundreds of little cocoons and listen to recorded testimonies from the Goutte d'Or.  Following the procession, the COCOON illumination takes place October 4 from 10:00 p.m. (22h) to 2:00 a.m. (2h). \n\nParticipants in Jackson, Mississippi walk through illuminated COCOON looking at little cocoons and listening to recorded testimony.\nWhat remains after the COCOON is taken down?\nI wish to leave behind a memory of the artwork, the experience and the voices of the participants.  I also hope to strengthen the neighborhood's links across cultures, socioeconomics, race and gender. \n\nPortraits by photographer Eric Etheridge\nAt \u00c9chomus\u00e9e, 320 portraits of participants holding their little cocoon taken by photographer Eric Etheridge, will form a giant mural that offers the public a different view of the Goutte d'Or and its inhabitants. Participants will be given their portrait at the end of the COCOON.\nPhotographer Eric Etheridge takes portraits of participants posing with their little cocoon.\nCOCOON a public space sculpture in the Goutte d'Or is a co-production between COCOON by Kate Browne and GFR- Le colletif. \n\nRewards\nTattoo\nA 2 X 4\" tattoo of the COCOON skeleton.

We want to talk. Give us a shout here to talk about how The Public Radio could fit into your next fund drive!\nIt's radio monogamy.\nOur interaction with FM radio today is simple - we just turn on and off the power. We rarely change stations, and *never* use those seek and scan buttons.  \nWe've gotten rid of all the parts of FM that are now obsolete, leaving only what matters. The Public Radio has all you need - just an antenna and a volume knob.\nHow it works \nLet's get one thing clear: The Public Radio only tunes to one station - your favorite one. When the campaign ends, we'll ask for your station's frequency & call letters, and will tune your Public Radio to that station before it ships.\nThe Public Radio is secured in place with the Mason jar's screw-on ring. The telescoping antenna screws through the lid, and batteries are accessed by removing the radio and installing them inside.\nTech Details\nAt the heart of The Public Radio is a Silicon Labs Si4831 FM IC. Its output is passed through a Texas Instruments TPA2005D1 class D amplifier which drives a 4 ohm 1.25\u201d speaker by Dayton Audio. The Public Radio is built on sturdy FR-4 printed circuit board, and houses a couple custom components, including a switched audio taper potentiometer and a seven segment telescoping antenna. The entire assembly is sandwiched together with our stamped stainless steel lid.\nWe spent a lot of time trying different assembly configurations and hardware specs. If you've got a hankering for details, shoot us a note - we're happy to geek out about it :) You're also welcome to check out our GitHub page, which has open-source versions of our EagleCAD files.\nSo... Why a Mason jar?\nHonestly? It was an accident. At first, we imagined an enclosure with a more contemporary aesthetic. But we needed to evaluate speakers in the meantime, and used a jar and a piece of cardboard as a stand-in. After trying it for an afternoon, we realized that it was just more fun to use something that was *literally* on our shelves.\nThe standard version of The Public Radio comes with its own 250mL square (ish) Ball jar, but you can swap the hardware out into any wide-mouth jar that you like.\nProject History\nWe've been working hard on the Public Radio for the past eighteen months, iterating our designs and building on feedback we received from our beta launch on Grand St. We've gone through seven PCB revisions to date, and have learned a *ton* about FM reception and circuit design in the process.\nFor the last three months we have researched, designed and ordered a handful of the custom parts necessary to make a small production run of The Public Radio. This includes the radio's custom potentiometer and antenna, both of which we received this June. We've also spent countless hours poring over our bill of materials, searching for ways to drop costs - and have researched & vetted our supply chain along the way. \nSome of the radio's hardware components (such as the custom lid) require big setup fees, and we need your help to cover them. Support the project by pre-ordering your own Public Radio and help make this a reality!\nWho we are\nWe're Zach Dunham and Spencer Wright, two childhood friends now living in Brooklyn. We ran around together as kids, and then went on to be hardware design, project management, and audio aficionados. After taking MIT's circuits & electronics class, we started hacking together on weekends, and eventually came up with a fun, compelling idea - that we finally had the skills to complete. \nWe had *tons* of engineering help from Todd Bailey and Andy Warner. Special thanks to Alexis Arkus-Duntov, Jonathan Bobrow, and Daniel Fishkin for their concepting help, and to Colin Reilly for cinematography. \nWe also couldn't have gotten this far without the help of our beta testers - thanks to Robert K, Ross W, Kristen S, Elana O, Harry J, Shawn F, Tracy L, Greg A, Ada P, Jacob C, Robert C, Paula P, Janna L, Cheryl R, Linnea J, Saralyn C, Robert L, and Henry L!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're confident with our mechanical and electrical design, but some logistical questions remain. Foremost in our minds is building a system that allows us to tune and then track unique radios to each of our backers as they come off of the production line. It'll be a bit tricky, but our fabrication partners are aware of the issue and have a preliminary plan to deal with it.\n\nWe're also anticipating some work in the management of vendors and manufacturers of our custom parts. We have parts coming from about a half dozen suppliers, and tracking their progress and dependencies will be a full-time job. But we've managed jobs of greater complexity before, and ultimately this will not be an impossible task. \n\nAnother expense (and logistical hurdle) will be the FCC tests that we're subject to. These will cost a few thousand dollars and will inevitably require a bit of effort and management. But ultimately, our production and testing partners are well-versed in this territory (and the specifications we need to pass are relatively easy), so we feel confident that it won't be a major issue.\n\nWe also need to find a clever use for all of the standard Mason jar lids that will come with the Public Radio's jars. We'll probably end up using them to make pickles, and there's always the chance that we ship out jars of those instead of the radios... but we're pretty sure we can keep them straight ;)\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #18", "update_userinfo": "Holiday sale + an open report on The Public Radio's operations", "update_content": "Friends-\nOn this Cyber Monday - really the most American of holidays - we've got two things to share with you.\nFirst, one that should be a pleasant surprise: For everyone (you!!) who backed our first Kickstarter campaign, we're offering a whopping 35% off all orders when you use the offer code \"LONGTIMEMONOGAMIST\" at checkout on our website: thepublicrad.io/purchase\nSecond, and perhaps less expected: As part of our ongoing effort to bring transparency to our operations, we published , as well as on our end.

Since its founding, the magazine has published a remarkable number of distinguished writers and artists and has won three National Magazine Awards. The Oxford American has been based in central Arkansas since 2002. It is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization.\nTHANK YOU!\nThank you to the many readers who backed our Texas music issue on Kickstarter. Now that our campaign is finished, please visit oxfordamerican.org to subscribe to the magazine, donate to the OA, or contact the staff. The Texas music issue will be on newsstands nationwide in December of 2014. It will be for sale on our website until it sells out. You can also stay in touch with the OA on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, or by signing up to receive our e-newsletter.\nABOUT THE MUSIC ISSUE \nThe Oxford American is best known for its annual music issue, which includes a gorgeously produced compact disc of songs selected by our editors. As critic Dwight Garner wrote in the New York Times, \u201cThese CDs practically belong in the Smithsonian.\u201d Since 2009, the OA's music issues have focused on a different Southern state each year, including Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, and Tennessee. This year, we are thrilled to turn our attention to the astonishing musical legacy of Texas.\nWHAT\u2019S WITH THE KICKSTARTER? (WHY DO YOU NEED MY MONEY NOW?) \nCompiling the OA's annual music issue is a labor of love, but the costs of licensing, producing, and manufacturing a compact disc\u2014on top of the already considerable costs of publishing our beautifully designed print edition\u2014have become increasingly difficult for the magazine to bear. In the past, the OA has relied on major underwriters to help cover these expenses. This year, we\u2019re asking our readers and listeners to take ownership of this project. We hope you will become the primary stakeholders of the Oxford American's Texas music issue. \nWHY TEXAS? \nTexas is without doubt one of the South\u2019s (and the world\u2019s) great musical incubators. The Lone Star state is the home of Blind Lemon Jefferson, T-Bone Walker, Lightin\u2019 Hopkins, Leadbelly, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Ornette Coleman, Buddy Holly, Gene Autry, and Bob Wills\u2014not to mention Janis Joplin, Doug Sahm, George Jones, Waylon Jennings, and Willie Nelson. And let\u2019s not forget Charlie Sexton, Townes Van Zandt, Guy Clark, Freddy Fender, Tish Hinojosa, and Carmen y Laura; Duke Records and Ideal Records and Arhoolie Records; the Butthole Surfers and Ray Price; Lou Ann Barton and Nanci Griffith and Brave Combo and Jerry Jeff Walker and Joe Ely. And we\u2019re just getting started.\nWHAT WE\u2019LL DO WITH YOUR CONTRIBUTION \nOur goal of $25,000 will ensure that we\u2019re able to continue our tradition of including a compact disc with the music issue, and it will go a long way toward helping us commission the best music writers and license the gorgeous artwork you love to see in our pages. \nDISTRIBUTION \nThe Texas Music Issue will be available on newsstands nationwide (and for sale on OxfordAmerican.org) on December 1, 2014. \nRewards will be distributed beginning December 2014. \nWHO'S RUNNING THIS THING?\nRoger D. Hodge, a native of Del Rio, Texas, has been the editor of the Oxford American since 2012.

He is currently writing a book about life in the West Texas borderlands. \nRick Clark is the music editor of the Oxford American.

The COOLEST cooler is 60 quarts of AWESOME packed with so much fun you'll look for excuses to get outside more often.\nMaybe you want to use the built-in ice crushing blender to whip up some margaritas or smoothies on your next boat trip or tailgate?\nMaybe you just want to always have music on hand with the waterproof bluetooth speaker or want to recharge your electronics with the built in USB charger?\nWhat else?\nREWARDS:\nUPDATE:  Color Voting Complete! \nHere are the Final Coolest Color options. When you pledge for a Coolest we'll send you a survey after the campaign to make your color choice.\nScroll on down for more details...                     \n      BLENDER\nNothing is more refreshing on a hot day than a cold blended cocktail or smoothie.  The 18 volt ice-crushing beast built into the COOLEST will power through more than 6 gallons of blended goodness on a single charge.\n WATERPROOF WIRELESS SPEAKERS\nIf life is supposed to be a party, then you better bring the music. You\u2019re gathered around the cooler anyway, but now you can DJ the music right from your phone or Bluetooth-enabled device directly to your COOLEST. Just turn your phone on, match it with the COOLEST speaker, and rock out with your bad self.\n                        USB CHARGER\n Since you\u2019ve got that 18 volt battery for the blender, why not get the most out of it? Maybe your camera battery is low or maybe you have an iPhone you just want to use after 3:00 in the afternoon... Re-charge your gear wherever you are with the waterproof USB charger.\n                          LED LID LIGHT\nThe party doesn\u2019t stop just because the sun goes down, and you shouldn\u2019t have to freeze your fingers searching endlessly for your favorite drink.  The COOLEST has unbreakable lights embedded in the lid so you easily find what you\u2019re looking for with the push of a button.\n                       GEAR TIE-DOWN\nCarrying your gear to and from your destination is a hassle, and your old cooler isn\u2019t doing you any favors.\nThe COOLEST's locking tie-downs are like having a roof-rack on your cooler so three trips can be done in one. Easily secure your lawn chairs, blankets, towels, toys, fishing tackle, or grill.\n                         BEACH TIRES\nOne of the worst unintended workouts can be had by trying to drag a conventional cooler through a sandy beach.  The COOLEST wheels are twice as wide so they roll easily and don't sink in.\n               ESSENTIAL STORAGE\nThere are certain essentials you need for any outdoor gathering so why not have a built in cubby to store them?  The COOLEST has storage for a half dozen reusable plastic plates, which also double as a cutting board for the ceramic rust-proof pairing knife.  \n                SPLIT LID and DIVIDER\nThe COOLEST has a split lid design so you can get access to ice for the blender without letting too much warm air in.  This also lets you keep your cups in the cup holders so you don't have to put everything on the ground just to grab another cold drink.\nThe split lid design and removable divider give you some great packing options.  You can keep your cocktail ice separate from your regular ice. Or you could put ice only on one side, pull the drain plug and the other side becomes a totally dry refrigerator, perfect for keeping sandwiches and any other perishable food cool and dry.\n                       BOTTLE OPENER\nHow many hours of your life have been wasted or teeth chipped because someone walked off with the bottle opener.  My grandpa's cooler had a bottle opener and so does the COOLEST.\nTHE STORY\nI\u2019m always looking to maximize my fun when I get together with my family and friends. That\u2019s why I am so passionate about the COOLEST. I invent lots of things, but other than my Jello-shot catapult very few have brought so much fun to my life. ;)\nI know firsthand how much fun it is to have a cooler with speakers, and a portable blender for beachside margaritas, because I built myself one of each around ten years ago. Last year I reexamined these well-loved creations and realized just how much room for improvement there was. \nWhat's next?\nI have manufactured and brought other products to market, but for a project of this size and complexity I'll be using a pool of experts in the field to make sure the COOLEST lives up to it\u2019s name.\nThe professional sourcing company I've partnered with has manufactured other coolers, as well as high tech gear. They have an experienced team in the field to assist with quality control, shipping and and other logistics. \nWe want you to have your COOLEST as soon as possible. Here\u2019s our plan to achieve that:\nJuly/August: Make lots of new Kickstarter friends, execute manufacturing agreements/standards\nSeptember:Finalize the engineering and prototype iterations and place the tooling orders\nOctober:  Tooling build-out and procurement of raw materials and components\nNovember: Part qualification and pre-production builds, pilot production, quality assurance and product validation\nDecember: Begin manufacturing for the injection molded and blow-molded parts\nJanuary/February: Finalize the assembly and shipment process and begin fulfillment", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNo one wants to see a good idea executed poorly, especially one called the COOLEST. We have worked extremely hard to ready this product for Kickstarter and full-scale manufacturing and fulfillment, but here are what I see as the risks:\n\n\nMANUFACTURING: Creating the tooling to manufacture a product of this size is expensive and requires expert knowledge to get it right. There is typically a 60 day lead time to create the molds for a product of this size and this is where delays could occur. To minimize that possibility we're working with tooling manufacturers partners with a track record for prompt quality.\n\nPRODUCT ADJUSTMENTS: As the COOLEST gets geared up for production, there will likely be some minor adjustments to improve the final product. Pre-production prototypes are made to test and refine the product and allow us to incorporate our adjustments and those suggested by experienced manufacturing partners. These will always be for the benefit of you, the consumer, and we will let you know exactly how and why any are made.\n\nFULFILLMENT: Sometimes things go awry that can\u2019t be planned for: a supplier misses a deadline, a machine breaks down, or a shipment gets lost. Those things could cause a delay. To minimize the possibility of manufacturing setbacks we will enter the manufacturing stage with at least one back-up supplier for each component pre-located and my product commercialization experts will help ensure smooth sailing from our suppliers and factories.\n\nWe will be working with manufacturers who have years of experience delivering excellent products in tremendous quantities. There will no doubt be some surprises along the road, but any obstacle will be addressed by combining our internal knowledge with external expertise, and an overall goal of making the best possible product for you, our COOLEST customer.\n\nAny pledge amount brings us one step closer to our goal.

Really? Yeah\u2026..\u201d <-- I hear this a lot \nWhy a picture book about economics? I love teaching and writing about economics. Some people don\u2019t realize that economics is about more than money. In fact, I am an environmental economist and rarely study money. Economics is about decision making and being fully informed of the outcomes or consequences of your decisions. I think that most economics principles can be told in an engaging way through the use of stories.\nWhy kids?\nAdults (even most college students) seem to hate economics. Maybe because they think it\u2019s hard, evil, or because they don\u2019t like to think about money. Kids don\u2019t have this bias. They want to learn about everything especially if it is entertaining. That is why this book was written to be entertaining and beautiful first, educational second.\nAlso, exposure to economics (without the terminology) introduces children to critical thinking, cause and effect, and encourages questioning. These concepts have been targeted as skills our children need to be successful in both school and life. (http://www.eschoolnews.com/2011/08/11/ten-skills-every-student-should-learn/3/, http://zenhabits.net/27-skills-your-child-needs-to-know-that-shes-not-getting-in-school/)\nWhat is this book about?\nThe book combines an interesting story about normal life and ideas related to economics. The goal is to write an interesting story first, and then apply stress to certain scenarios that can act as learning opportunities. For example, instead of just deciding to buy a soccer ball; character\u2019s would imagine what the outcomes would be based on this decision. The characters also have short dialogues with friends, parents, and themselves to flesh their decision making process. This expansion of the thought process highlights the idea of a tradeoff (or scarcity) which can be stressed by a parent or teacher.\nWhat's in the book?\n32 full color pages of pure economic awesomeness. And a few more pages of legalese and economics jargon :). See below for some examples:\nExcerpts from \u201cJohnny\u2019s Decision\u201d, at the park:\n\n\u201cWe can play tag for five minutes,\u201d Adam shared. Johnny stopped to think about his possible choices.\n\u201cWe can play tag for five minutes, or we can climb up and go down the slide a lot of times in five minutes\u201d He thought.\n\u201cTag is fun,\u201d said Johnny \u201cBut I think we can go up and down the slide 100 times if we start now.\u201d\n\u201cRace you to the slide!\u201d Yelled Adam as he ran towards the slide.\nAt the store with mom:\n\u201cHere\u2019s $10 for a present,\u201d said Johnny\u2019s mom \u201cwhat about that soccer ball or a book?\u201d\n\u201cThe ball! Taylor likes to play soccer,\u201c said Johnny \u201cBut she also likes to read about animals.\u201d\n\u201cCan I get both?\u201d\nAt the end:\n\u201cTime for ice cream,\u201d said Taylor\u2019s dad. \u201cDo you want some Johnny?\u201d\n\u201cOf course!\u201d he responds.\n\u201cWhat flavor? Cookie dough or chocolate mint?\u201d\nJohnny thought hard\u2026\n\u201cBOTH!!!\u201d\nThe book includes possible activities to consider after reading:\nWhat decisions did Johnny have to make in this story?\nDid he have to think hard about the decisions he had to make?\nWhat did he think about when he made his decisions?\nWhat decisions have you made today?\nWere they easy or hard decisions to make?\nWhat did you think about when you made your decisions today?\nThe book also includes a mini economics lesson for older kids or adults interested in the terminology:\nIn this book Johnny had to make a lot of decisions and most of them involved a tradeoff. This means that when you make a decision to do something, you are usually giving up something else. Economists often use the term \u201copportunity cost\u201d when considering tradeoffs. An opportunity cost of a decision is the value of the next best alternative to the decision that is made. Most of the time this alternative is measured using money, but it does not have to be. Time or other resources can be used to measure opportunity costs.\nFor example, Johnny decides to go to Taylor\u2019s birthday party. His opportunity cost is going to Adam\u2019s birthday. It is also possible to measure Johnny\u2019s opportunity cost with time. If the party takes three hours, then the opportunity cost of going to the party is three hours.\nFinally, each of the characters in the book are named after real life economists. Their contributions to economics and the world are briefly detailed:\nJohnny: John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946):\nJohn was one of the first macroeconomists to formalize arguments encouraging government intervention in the economy. He suggested that currency deflation could boost exports, and public spending could create jobs. John\u2019s policies were taken seriously post World War I and were formalized as Keynesian economics.\nTaylor: Harriet Taylor Mill (1807-1858):\nTaylor published little of her own work during her lifetime (this was common for women during this time period unfortunately). She did, however, read and comment on much of the material produced by John Stuart Mill. Mill is famous for his contributions to economic freedom, utilitarian regulation, women\u2019s rights, and environmental protection. He claimed that Taylor was a valuable contributor to his work.\nAdam: Adam Smith (1723-1790):\nAdam is considered the \u201cfather of modern economics\u201d for his work on the Wealth of Nations. He argued that rational self-interest and market competition leads to economic prosperity. He called this process \u201cthe invisible hand\u201d. Adam can be credited for laying the groundwork for many economics concepts, including supply and demand, marginal analysis, and capitalism.\nLogistics: This project needs $1,500 to happen. Where does this money go?\nMost of the money received through kickstarter will be used for illustrating the book. The rest of the money will be spend on the rewards promised through kickstarter and the fees associated with it. Finally, any money left over will be spent on promotion of the book by giving free copies to schools, day cares, and libraries. The book will be published through create space, and will be available both digitally and physically. Create space is a print on demand service owned by Amazon that allows you to retain control of your work and the prices associated with it. The story has been completed and only needs to be illustrated. The book will be finished by November and ready for distribution during the holidays. The book is being illustrated by Mentol Art, you can see some of her previous work here on Amazon: Here\nProfessional editing and designer will also be done at my own cost.\nStretch Goals:\nAlthough this may be a bit ambitious, for every $1,500 that is raised, another book will be able to be illustrated and published. Possible ideas for future books include:\n\u2022 The environment (how the environment is like a piggy bank, we can\u2019t expect it to give forever unless we also \"save\")\n\u2022 Scarcity (1 pizza, many friends\u2026)\n\u2022 Public goods (Someone steals all the roses and the park becomes ugly)\n\u2022 Why we use money (friends trade food and toys, until a kid develops \u201cbottlecap currency\u201d)\n\u2022 Supply (Open an iced tea stand and need to hire additional help)\nI have many other ideas, but these have the most developed stories.\nRewards!\n$5: A PDF or Ebook version of the book.\n$15: Early bird! A physical copy of the book, sent to your house!\n$20: A physical copy of the book, sent to your house!\n$30: An autographed copy of the book (made out to you or your children) and a PDF or Ebook version of the book.\n$100: Your, or your child\u2019s, name in the front dedications, AND an Autographed book, and a digital book.\n$500: If stretch goals are met, you choose the topic for the next book (or we can collaborate on a new topic).

Our customized donuts allow you to step out of the traditional donut box and pick combinations that you like.\nNaked Mini Donuts\nWhy Donuts?\nOur concept was created by four friends who had previously lived and worked together in Anchorage, Alaska.  We found ourselves reunited   in Columbus, GA enjoying homemade tacos during a weekly event called Taco Tuesday. During a typical Taco Tuesday the topics of discussion usually revolved around work, sports, and currents events. On this particular Tuesday, the talk was all about donuts. One of the participating members of Taco Tuesday suggested an idea of creating a donut shop which provided fresh, made to order donuts and allowed the customer to decide which toppings they would like on their donuts. From that point forward the donut would be forever revolutionized, no longer would you walk into a donut shop and ask for the standard fare; but the customer would have the freedom to decide what toppings they would like on a donut. After several hours of deliberation, changing of subjects, and a few luke warm tacos, The Naked Donut Company was born. \nLong lines for donuts at our tent!\nHow can I (you) help?\nWe built the table top in my apartment....neighbors hated me!\nUp to this point we've managed to do everything ourselves.

There are more than 50 regions to explore and over 200 monsters to capture, each with their own unique abilities. Dive into deep quest lines, explore exciting and beautiful regions, and create an unstoppable team of elemental beasts to take back Adonia and restore peace to the Torrae!\nAt the start of your adventure, you will get to pick from ten unique hero classes as well as your first companion monster. Once you do, you're set out on your journey to explore Adonia, fighting alongside the monsters you free from elemental slavery and helping the Torrae you find along your way.\nThe Monsters of Adonia\nHere's a quick look at a few of the 200+ monsters you'll be able to fight alongside; each is conjured of one of the 5 elements and specializes in a specific area of combat, all with their own unique abilities!\nFaye, Nature/Intellect\nBearen, Metal/Stamina\nAlaran, Water/Agility\nPyre, Fire/Spirit\nShardus, Earth/Strength\nMonsters battle in strategic, turn-based combat. Your goal is to line up combos to catch your opponent off guard while preventing his monster and hero from blocking your moves. To win, you'll have to outwit your opponent and select your abilities carefully.\nScreenshot from Pre-Alpha Nature combat scene. Pictured here is a full-screen UI (work in progress), which will be an alternative to MIGUS (tap-based commands).\nScreenshot of pre-Alpha combat scene. Here, the player's hero transmuted the battlefield to Water-type to prevent the opponent from using Fire spells.\nRethinking Mobile Gaming with MIGUS\nWe're often asked what platform Adonia: AotE is going to be released on, and the best part is that you'll be able to capture monsters, take out the Elementalists, and battle your friends right on your Android or iOS smartphone. However, this isn't like any other RPG in the mobile market. The problem that most developers run into with mobile gaming, without the controller of a handheld console, is a clunky and intrusive touch-screen GUI. We never liked those, so we designed MIGUS, our Minimal Input Graphicless User-interface System. MIGUS allows us to create a full-featured RPG, like what you'd find on a handheld console, right on your phone. By breaking down all the commands of an RPG into simple tap-based commands, you'll be able to interact directly with the game, and not with awkwardly flat buttons. With MIGUS, you simply swipe in the direction you'd like to move, tap on the objects you'd like to interact with, and use a variety of different tap-based commands to bring up inventories, spells, and quest logs. \nElements and Specializations\nIn Adonia: AotE, each monster has an element and a specialized area of combat. Above, you can see examples of each, the elements are Nature, Fire, Metal, Water, and Earth; and the combat specializations are Strength, Agility, Stamina, Intellect, and Spirit. Each element and specialization offers unique abilities, meaning there are 120 different skillsets! In addition, each monster has its own unique abilities, and you'll be able to train them in different specializations as you level them up.\nHero Classes\nAlong with leveling up your monsters and teaching them new abilities, your hero will also learn new spells to help your companions in the thick of the fight. You'll be able to pick from ten classes, each offering unique bonuses that will allow you to customize your play style and discover hidden strategies. Here's a list of the planned classes that you'll be able to choose from to begin your journey in Adonia:\nKickstarter Only - Warlock: Store marks of death on your opponents to heal your pets and vanquish the enemy's resistances\nAvailable to Public\nMage: Increase your pet's elemental damage and conjure the elements to cripple your opponents\nAlchemist: Transmute the battlefield to favor your pet's element\nCommander: Fight alongside your pet and protect them from incoming attacks\nRogue: Increase your pet's physical damage by storing shadow marks on the opponent\nTracker: Set traps to disable your enemies and turn the tide of battle\nProphet: Predict your opponent's plays and retaliate with powerful combos\nSharpshooter: Deal massive damage from afar and increase the agility of your pets\nTrainer: Access class-exclusive abilities and stat bonuses for your pets\nChampion: Protect your pets with defensive bonuses and ability interceptions\nWith so many classes, elements, and abilities, you'll be able to craft a team that perfectly suits your style, whether it's landing powerful combo attacks or setting up defenses to trap your enemies, you can battle your friends and test thousands of combinations to find the one that will best suit you!\nIn-Depth Look at Gameplay\nAdonia: Age of the Elementalists is a highly strategic game that pits monsters and their heroes against the world and other trainers. As you explore the world, you will come across the Elementalists and their armies of monsters, which you face one-on-one in turn-based combat.\nWhen fighting wild monsters, your job as a hero is to command your pets to successfully land combo attacks on the enemy and, if you have a charged energy crystal, relinquish the beast from its slavery to the Elementalists to join you in your quests. If you defeat the monster, your pet will earn experience to gain new levels, learn new abilities, and modify its unique stats (strength, agility, stamina, spirit, or intellect). Your monsters can be as diverse as you'd like- whether its an agility-focused damage-dealer that you've decided to train with stamina to increase its defenses, or an intellect spellcaster that you've decided to teach strength to balance its powers and become a versatile fighter- you'll be able to try thousands of strategies and create an unstoppable team.\nThe more monsters you defeat, the more experience your hero gains as well. Heroes are able to intervene by using incredibly powerful moves to turn the tide of battle. If you call into battle your low-defense agility pet, you might want your champion or commander to step into the fray and block incoming damage from the enemy; or, if you're a warlock, absorb the power of his attacks to help him recover from enemy blows. Each hero class has 20 unique abilities that each suit a different play style.\nOnce you reach the great cities, you're put up against the Elementalists, each having pets of their own that you'll have to take out. After you battle your way through their defenses and defeat them, your job is to defeat their leader and use their alchemy to transform the city back to its former glory. Once successful, you can move on to the other cities; and once you've restored all of Adonia, you'll be able to battle your friends online and earn access to the Shadow Realm, where the most experienced heroes battle Adonia's most feared enemy, the Gharyan.\nOnline Play and the Shadow Realm\nOnce you've restored Adonia to peace (by defeating the Elementalist leaders), you will be able to face other players online to continue training your pets and learning new abilities. Once you've proven yourself in The Arena (online Player vs. Player combat) by defeating another player, you will be able to access the gates of the Shadow Realm, where you face the most epic monsters that are controlled by the Gharyan, a despicable race of Torrae who have chosen to live in the shadows. You'll find new monsters, new challenges, and new titles as you prepare yourself for the release of Adonia: Revenge of the Shadow Realm, the free-to-play expansion. We do not currently have a release date, but we anticipate its official release in January 2015.\nNote to Backers: As of now, online play will only be after the game has been completed (All 5 Elementalist leaders defeated), and will be 1v1 PvP. This is because we'd like players to have built a diverse team and understand how to strategize battles before they play against others. We would like to expand this online section of the game to include bosses, which would be fought as multiplayer PvE, and that will be our primary focus with any excess funding. The game will be able to be played offline (single player RPG) or online (multiplayer PvP).\nWho We Are and Where We Are Now\nWe are Brick House Games, a small mobile game developer working on the release of our first game, Adonia. It will be a long-running series paying great detail to lore and strategy-based game play. We are almost ready to release the Alpha for this game, but we really, really want to make it a hit; and in order to do so, we're asking for funding so we can expand the world and offer up more monsters to capture by hiring another artist part-time. The money raised in this campaign will go to paying for another very talented and creative addition to our art team, who are absolutely drowning in work right now! The $10,000 will cover the cost of adding a new, part-time team member for 4 months, and if we surpass our goal, we will be able to bring on another programmer or web developer to speed up the release and add more features like multiplayer PvE and team battles!\nA Word From Brandon Burkhouse, Lead Developer: Hey Kickstarter! My name is Brandon, and I'm the lead developer for Adonia: AotE. We've really designed something special with MIGUS in that we've been able to break down every command you would need in an RPG into tap-based commands so there's no need for a GUI. By doing this, we\u2019re able to set new boundaries for mobile gaming, meaning you\u2019ll no longer be limited to mind-numbing games that advertise themselves as \u201cthe best way to kill time when you\u2019re bored\u201d. You\u2019ll be able to dive into and interact with a whole new world, fighting alongside your companions and battling your friends online. We\u2019re treading waters that no gaming company would dare to, because we\u2019re not tied to the same level of corporate scrutiny. We\u2019re independent developers, artists, programmers, and writers, and it\u2019s up to people like us - who put their heart and soul into these projects - to raise the bar for the gaming industry; and it\u2019s up to people like you - those who support these crazy ideas - to help keep us running. Your support isn't just going to get you an awesome reward, it\u2019s going to help keep ideas like this alive, ideas that expand the boundaries of what we thought to be possible. So I\u2019d like to personally thank you; your support will help us create a truly beautiful game, one that you\u2019ll even be able to help build :)\nMeet Alice Catrinel Ciobotaru, Lead Artist: Alice is an incredibly talented artist, and leads our team to create the beautiful and intricate world of Adonia. Here's an interview conducted by tutorialboard.net in 2011: http://bit.ly/1s3e8G4\nStretch Goals\n$15,000: We will ramp up our online multiplayer battle engine to include more Shadow Realm zones and arenas, as well as rewards such as titles, items, rare monsters, and achievements that will earn you bonuses in the expansion. We will also include multiplayer PvE so you can take down bosses with your friends!\n$20,000: We will bring on another web developer to help design the website, and add more content, including a community forum for strategy discussions and animated lore so you can dive into the lives of the Torrae and their deep history.\n$30,000: We will get a head start on creating the expansion, Adonia: Revenge of the Shadow Realm, where monsters from the Shadow Realm fight with the five conscious elements: shadow, light, energy, life, and death, to take over Adonia, and you must fight beside your friends to save the world. This will be a free-to-play expansion.$50,000+: If we exceed $50,000, we will be able to kick off Adonia: Age of the Elementalists with much-improved animations, deeper quest lines, and a stronger community base with a higher marketing budget.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur biggest fear is that which lays in the Shadow Realm: the unforeseen bugs and technical glitches that we must overcome every day.

We began dating when we were 17 and married at the tender age of 21. It's the only relationship either of us have ever been in. I thought I was one lucky woman to find the love of my life so early. I thought by doing so I had escaped heartbreak. This has not been the case. \nAfter being together for over 13 years, my husband has left me. I did not anticipate his abandonment. I thought we were happy and he adored me as much as i did him. However, he has told me that he wants to \"take a break\" and see what other experiences are out there. I can only assume that, for him, the infamous \"seven year itch\" has come a bit later. \nAgainst my wishes he has cut me out of his life for the next 3 months while he explores his options. He expects me to sit on my hands during that time while he figures out if he wants to keep the promise he made to me over 9 years ago. He must not know me as well as I thought he did. \nWhat To Do\nAt 30, I have never been a single woman. My husband was my first and only boyfriend. He was my date to every high school dance. Over a decade later he has forced me into the single life and I'm the type of person who turns tragedy into opportunity. I have to figure out who I am without him. \nI've been a freelance writer and photographer since 2010. I've traveled the world reporting on an array of interesting topics. From investigating the shark infected beaches of Recife, Brazil to exploring the drug culture in Amsterdam. I have been very fortunate to do what I love and now I'm turning my predicament into a story to share with others. While my husband figures out his life I want to go out into the world and create my own story.\nI've decided to take a trip somewhere I've never been, meet new and interesting people and turn this unexpected situation into something positive. Everyone has experienced the agony of heart break. I want to share mine with others as a source of inspiration. \nI plan on documenting my trip for Eide Magazine, a publication available nationwide at Barnes & Noble as well as Whole Foods . This feature will bring my travels (that you guys help make possible) to the masses. I will also post a photo gallery and personal narratives on my blog aspiringgypsy.com. \nWhere Will I Go\nRight now, I'm looking at a 9 day trip to Thailand with the tour company Contiki.com. While I've traveled through Europe and South America several times, I have never been to Asia and Thailand is a beautiful place to start. This trip will be different from others that I've taken in this it will be a trip to self discovery. I've never embarked upon a foreign country completely solo with the purpose of self reflection. I have been someone's wife for over 9 years so now is a time to focus on who I am as an individual. \nI've chosen to use a tour company, and particularly this trip, because they offer affordable last minute trips.  They also pair you with a group of individuals in your demographic so you have the opportunity to forge lasting relationships during your travels. I feel that through a tour group environment I can divide my time between being alone and meeting new people. \nI have the entire month of September to travel so if I raise more money I'll simply extend my trip as long as funds permit. The longer the trip the better the story =)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenges I would face if my project were made possible would be overcoming my own insecurities and emotions. Trying to use my setback as a way to expand my horizons may prove to be overwhelming at first. However, I adapt to situations easily and find that turning challenges or uncomfortable situation into an assignment helps me put things in a new perspective. \n\nOther challenges would be what any traveler faces; delayed flights, unexpected illness, lost luggage, etc. I have experienced all of these situations in the past and as a seasoned traveler am prepared to handle these setbacks as they arise.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Ashley Brechtel\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nI'm a freelance writer and photographer originally from New Orleans, LA.
