We want to thank everyone for all the tremendous support and feedback we've received from our first Kickstarter campaign. Although our original Beastgrip was a great product, there's always room for improvement when you shoot for perfection (no pun intended). After carefully examining the real world feedback our users shared with us using dozens of different phone models, we completely redesigned our product to be the best phoneography tool in the world. The result is the Beastgrip Pro. Along with the BG Pro, we are proud to introduce our Beastgrip conversion lenses and DOF (Depth of Field) adapter, for use with SLR lenses.\nMobile phones have come a long way. From the very beginning we believed that the cell phone everyone owns can be so much more. With new models getting smarter by the minute, we sought to design a product that can adapt as fast as they do. Most phones on the market today have high-quality cameras, editing applications, and even 4K video recording; they're a very powerful production tool for everyday users and creative professionals. We've seen smartphones photograph and record priceless everyday moments, real estate properties, business training videos, commercials, interviews, journalism content, action/sports videos, short and feature-length films\u2026 the list goes on.\nWe realized having a single device that adapts to every phone increases efficiency and brings a world of new possibilities to create the content you want.\nBeastgrip was used in a variety of different projects, below are a few examples:\nAfter our original Beastgrip was launched on Kickstarter back in 2013, our customers were able to test it in real world scenarios and give us vital feedback. We listened. Almost every component was redesigned to improve functionality, adaptability and the manufacturing process. Now it\u2019s stronger, more functional and easier to use with any phone. Set it up exactly how you want. Transforms from a basic tripod mount to a full-featured professional rig in no time.\nWe believe the Beastgrip Pro will be the best and most versatile tool in the world for mobile photographers and videographers.\nOur patent-pending design has an adjustable lens mount and clamps that adapt to virtually any phone. Our new clamps quickly secure both small and large devices and the redesigned lens mount assembly is built on a three-way axis to accommodate ANY phone-even if it has a protruded camera.\nPlease check the size and specs of your phone (with or without protective case) as demonstrated on drawing below. We are confident it will fit perfectly!*\n* There are few phone models such as the LG G Flex/2 (curved shape with button on the back panel) and LG G2 (with button on the back panel) which will fit in the clamps properly, but can't be aligned perfectly with lens mount because of the shape and/or button on the back panel.\n*Nokia Lumia 1520 can be used with Beastgrip Pro. Simply remove the handle on the BG's lens mount assembly to align the lens mount with the 1520's camera properly.\n*If you have a bulky protective case or have any doubts if it will fit properly, please PM us, we will be more than happy to assist you. \niPhone 6\nOnePlus One\niPhone 6 Plus\nNokia Lumia 1020\niPhone 5\nSamsung Galaxy Note 4. Photo by Courtney Jones, Pod Intermedia\n                           The Beastgrip Pro locks your phone in place faster than you can say \u201cBeastgrip.\u201d Oh, and if you have your favorite protective case, don\u2019t worry about removing it \u2013 our unique design works with many phone cases.\nUse it how you want. We designed the Beastgrip Pro with flexibility in mind. If your looking for a simple tripod mount, comfortable grip paired with your favorite clip-on lens or a full-featured setup with tons of accessories, then look no further. The Beastgrip Pro can do it all.\nBe ready for anything. With a standard threaded 37mm lens/filter mount, cold shoe mount and five 1/4\"-20 threaded mounts already built-in, you can easily attach all the accessories you need for the perfect shot. Our patent-pending design allows you to use as much or as little as you need, making it the most versatile platform in the world for mobile shooters.\nPlease check user manual for more info.  \nWe started working on the Beastgrip Pro using 3D printing, which allowed us to make minor adjustments to the original design - until we hit a point where our design improvements made it too fragile. So instead, we teamed up with professional engineers and worked tirelessly with manufacturers to ensure the Beastgrip Pro will be stronger than ever before.\nAll of the major components of the Beastgrip Pro are custom manufactured. The main body components will be manufactured using a mold injection process with an extremely durable glass-filled nylon material. Rubber overmolded clamps will hold your phone securely and protect it from scratches. The custom-machined brass lens mount ring and threaded inserts are molded-in place before the material hardens, forming an unbreakable bond. And the custom-machined anodized aluminum standoffs and aluminum thumb screws with a soft nylon tip assure a smooth operation and increased durability. All products will be fully assembled by hand in Chicago, Illinois with the highest quality and craftsmanship. \n The Beastgrip Pro has a 37mm threaded lens mount that can be used with a wide variety of conversion lenses, filters and DOF adapters (DOF adapters need to be combined with an SLR lens).\nWith the high demand of today's clip-on lens users, we've completely redesigned our lens mount assembly. Our new lens mount is removable, allowing you to attach a mobile clip-on lens to your phone AND use the Beastgrip Pro for better handling, attaching a tripod mount and/or accessories, etc.\n Along with Beastgrip Pro we are launching DOF adapter and conversion lenses!!!\n The Beastgrip DOF adapter allows you to use some* of SLR lenses with your smartphone to achieve a shallow depth of field effect and manual focus control. Please note: Using a DOF adapter is not simply \"point and shoot\" capable; it takes time and practice to achieve the desired results.\nDOF adapters are great to express your artistic nature, allowing you to create unique photographs and videos with your camera phone.\n*The Beastgrip DOF adapter is made of a tube with an SLR mount ring (Canon EF mount) on one side and a set of macro lenses on the other. Inside of the tube is a focusing screen mounted on custom holder. The SLR lens projects the image onto the focusing screen, allowing the camera phone to frame the intermediate screen by focusing in macro mode. The principle is similar to pointing a camera at a movie screen. The phone camera's only responsibility at this point is to record what is being projected onto the focusing screen. Additional information on DOF adapters and how they work can be found on wikipedia.\nPhoto taken with OnePlus One, DOF adapter and Nikkor f1.4 50mm lens\nPhoto taken with iPhone 6Plus, DOF adapter and Nikkor f1.4 50mm lens\nPhoto taken with OnePlus One phone, DOF adapter, led ring light and Canon EF 50mm f1.4\nPhoto taken with Nokia Lumia 1020, DOF adapter and Nikkor f1.4 50mm lens\nVideo Shot on iPhone 6 mounted on Beastgrip Pro with DOF adapter and Nikon 80-240mm f4.0 lens\nPlease note: \nBeastgrip DOF adapter has Canon EF mount, other SLR lenses can be used with the proper adapter rings. Please note: Adapter rings are not included.\nFor best results, we recommend to use fast lenses (f0.9-f2.8).\nDOF adapter will decrease the quality of photos and videos taken with it.\nThere may be visible texture, dimples and/or specks of the focusing screen on the image.\nVignetting, barrel distortion and chromatic aberration are common issues with any DOF adapter\nThe DOF adapter flips the image upside-down.\nFor the past two years, we have built and tested a number DOF adapter variations. We are now confident that we've created the best simple static DOF adapter on the market.\nTo learn more, please visit the link Beastgrip DOF adapter\nConsidering that DOF adapters display the image you are taking upside down, we recommend using one of these apps when using our DOF adapter; they will allow you to flip the image to the proper orientation. \nFiLMiC Pro and Ultrakam apps (iOS)\nOpen Camera (Android) \nWe are also working on our BeastCam camera app that will have a \"flip the view\" option in both photo and video modes, plus many other useful features. We are planning to release it in summer.\nThe Beastgrip 37mm 0.43x Extreme Wide-Angle lens allows you to capture a much wider field of view than your phone's stock camera lens. It has a removable macro lens component that can be used separately for close-up shots.\nPhoto taken with iPhone 6plus and Beastgrip Wide-Angle Lens\nPhoto taken with iPhone 5s and macro lens part\nThe Beastgrip 37mm Fisheye Lens is an ultra wide-angle lens that produces strong visual distortion and enables you to capture approximately 180 degrees field of view in a single frame. It's a great lens to achieve unique visual effects and it's really fun to use. It has a removable macro lens component that can be used separately for close-up shots.\nPhoto taken with iPhone 6plus and Beastgrip Fisheye Lens\nPhoto taken with Oneplus One and Beastgrip Fisheye lens\nPhoto taken with OnePlus One and macro lens part\n                                                The most challenging part of any new product is manufacturing it for the first time. The funds we are raising will be strictly used for production tooling, manufacturing/bulk ordering of injection-molded and machined parts, DOF adapter/lens components, and assembly line setup.\nWe're also designing an additional attachment that will transform the Beastgrip Pro into a tablet-ready camera rig AND we're preparing our own full-featured camera app, BeastCam, for release this year. With a successful Kickstarter campaign, we'll not only be able to produce the Beastgrip Pro, DOF adapter and lenses, but we can continue to create more great photography products.\nTogether we can make all this happen!\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, a direct\u00ad response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.\nDisclaimer:\nProduct names, logos, brands, and other trademarks featured or referred to within BEASTGRIP CO products and services and within beastgrip.com and this Kickstarter campaign are the property of their respective trademark holders.

LeVar Burton here. You may know me as Kunta Kinte, from ROOTS, or Geordi La Forge, from Star Trek: The Next Generation. \nYou also may have grown up with me on Reading Rainbow. \nIt was my mother who taught me that, by picking up a book, I could \"go anywhere\" and \"be anything.\" Ever since Reading Rainbow began in 1983, I have dedicated myself to fostering a love of reading in children, just as my mother did for me. \nOver the past year, I have watched Kickstarter bring communities together to support artists and inventors. Again and again, I have been inspired by watching like-minded people team up to accomplish impossible dreams, and to change the world. \nNow, I am hoping you will join me on my mission: to bring Reading Rainbow back for every child, everywhere.\nTogether, we can change the lives of millions of children. But you don't have to take my word for it: just keep reading!\nI believe that every child has a right, and a need, to be literate. We have a responsibility to prepare our children\u2026 and right now, the numbers show that we, as a society, are failing in that responsibility.\nAnd here\u2019s the problem:\nAnd: numerous studies reveal that children who can't read at grade level by the 4th grade are 400% more likely to drop out of high school.\nAnd: as of 2011, America was the only free-market country where the current generation was less well educated than the one before.\nThese problems won't solve themselves.  Real change will require us all to work together. We cannot afford to lose generations of children to illiteracy. And if we work together, we don't have to.\nThrough Reading Rainbow, we've been working to solve these problems for over three decades. Starting in 1983, Reading Rainbow successfully used television to turn generations of kids into lifelong readers... with great results.\nOf course, when Reading Rainbow began in 1983, we were using television to bring books to kids, meeting them where they wanted to be. In 2014, TV is not that place anymore. Now, we\u2019re trying to reach a new generation of digital natives.\nThat\u2019s why, two years ago, I launched the Reading Rainbow App for tablets. Building on the basics of the television series, we put hundreds of quality books \u2013 and educational video field trips \u2013 right in a child\u2019s hands.\nThe response has been encouraging:\nBut despite this progress, there are big challenges left to face.\nFirst, not all families have access to tablets. Our goal is to cultivate a love of reading in all children, not just those that have tablets. To reach kids everywhere, we need to be everywhere: we need to be on the web, on mobile devices, on game consoles and on connected televisions. \nSecond, a resounding number of teachers have told me that they want Reading Rainbow in their classrooms, where they know it can make a difference. We will provide it, along with the tools that teachers need, including teacher guides, leveling, and dashboards. And with your help, we'll provide it to thousands of disadvantaged classrooms for FREE.\nEvery Home. Reading Rainbow\u2019s digital collection already contains hundreds of books and video field trips\u2026 but with your help, we\u2019ll be able to make the Reading Rainbow library available on more of the devices modern kids use to consume content. Now that we've met our initial goal of $1,000,000, we will be able to launch a new version of Reading Rainbow on the single most-used digital platform: the web. And now that we've reached our stretch goal of$5,000,000, we'll also be able to bring the service to mobile phones, Android, game consoles like XBOX and PlayStation, and set-top boxes like AppleTV and ROKU.\nEvery Classroom. Together, we want to provide Reading Rainbow to as many classrooms as possible FOR FREE! Now that we've reached our stretch goal of $5,000,000, we'll be able to provide year-long subscriptions in over 7,500 classrooms \u2013 and every additional $100K we raise lets us help 500 more!\nNo matter how much we raise, we promise that every dollar you pledge will bring Reading Rainbow to more platforms, and provide it for free in more classrooms.\nWe can make sure that millions of kids learn to love reading, but we can\u2019t do it without you. That's why I hope you\u2019ll join me in making a difference!\nI believe that spreading the love of reading is its own greatest reward. But if you're going to join our cause, we also have some wonderful prizes. But you don't have to take my word for it... Take a look!\nAside from the signed book, the rewards above will be available to anyone who pledges! \nBut we also have several LIMITED EDITION rewards... so be sure to get them before we run out! (And if we DO run out, keep checking back -- we'll do our best to add more when we can!)\nOr, if you prefer, you can also pledge for a reward package that will be gifted to the classroom or school of your choice!\nAnd, if you're just interested in Star Trek related rewards, and don't want all of the Reading Rainbow goodies above, we've also got a few special reward levels created just for you:\nThis Kickstarter \u2013 and Reading Rainbow \u2013 couldn't happen alone, so I want you to meet the full team behind our Kickstarter.\nEverytime I walk into the office, I am reminded that the Reading Rainbow team is made up of passionate, talented artists, producers, engineers, and so many more. Most of them grew up on the show, have families of their own now, and dedicate their working day to improving the lives of the next generation.  \nIt's an honor to be surrounded by my Reading Rainbow family every day, and we can't wait for you to join us.

After the unexpected success of our first fundraiser, we have spent the past few years brainstorming what we could do next. We wanted to do something more challenging and with greater lasting impact.\nOur first Kickstarter was really a proof-of-concept: would it be possible to to hire an orchestra, record a bunch of famous music, and release it all for free? Would anyone care? \nThe response was amazing, positive, and far beyond what we expected with our original $11,000 goal. Since it has been a few years, here is a sample of what we heard the first time around.\nNow we are asking for your help to move beyond proof of concept and tackle something much more ambitious. We believe this project goes beyond just classical music, and encapsulates what the open culture movement is all about. \nWe are asking for your help to free the life's work of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin. \nWhy now?\nIt is 164 years after Chopin's death. His music is well into the public domain, yet most people consume it as if it were still copyrighted: from CDs, iTunes, or Youtube videos (many of which are copyrighted). \nWe think Chopin deserves better. \n\nWhy Chopin?\nMost public domain music is limited to the classical genre (1920's and before), but the goals of Musopen are not limited to one genre, so we want an artist that has broad appeal. Among the most enduringly popular composers, Chopin stands out. He also composed an amount of music which is manageable for us to record. If we had chosen Mozart, our funding goal would have to have another zero at the end. \nWe also wanted an artist that would be versatile, enabling many projects to make use of his music.\nIt doesn't hurt that he just celebrated his 200th birthday three years ago. This is a belated gift but one we think he would appreciate.\nOur goals\n1.To preserve indefinitely and without question everything Chopin created. To release his music for free, both in 1080p video and 24 bit 192kHz audio. This is roughly 245 pieces.\n2. To ask (and try to answer): how should one preserve and experience the life's work of a person? A static list of links  does not do justice to the immense gravity of Chopin's artistic output. We have a few ideas which we address below.\nOur Performers\nWe have some incredible musicians lined up. One or two have even placed in one of the most prestigious piano competitions in the world. Our musicians are students at some of the best conservatories in the world, professors, professional pianists, and recording artists. \nChopin Musicians\nStretch Goals\n$85,000 - We will hire composers to create and release new music into the public domain. This will not be limited to any genre, and all composers will be asked to donate their submissions so that we will benefit from much more public domain music.\n$90,000 - Music request system - A system to match artists with requests for music recordings. Collaborative bidding so costs are distributed to all interested.\n$95,000 - Desktop streaming radio app (like Pandora but lossless, and includes commercial content).\n$100,000 - Videos of all performances in 1080p HD + behind the scenes + interviews from the musicians.\n$135,000 - We will live-stream the performances.\n$200,000 - We will pair all recordings with free public performances. Let's turn free recordings into free civic art.\n\n\nBut wait, there's more...\nGiven the response of our first Kickstarter, we want to aim higher than a single set of recordings. Kickstarter is an amazing platform for creative projects, but we want to leverage the energy and support everyone showed last time as an opportunity to indefinitely sustain Musopen, so that it independently contributes music on an ongoing basis. \nAll backers for this project at the $50 level and above will get a \"Supporting Membership\" free for one year. Our goal is that you consider continuing your support after this first year, so that we can reach 1,000 supporting members. This is the minimum required for Musopen to be able to do a recording project every year. This goal removes our dependence on one-off projects and allows us the best of all possible worlds: ambitious and innovative projects via Kickstarter, regular contributions to our library, and music educational materials from our base of supporting members.\n\nNow on to the good stuff...Rewards\nWe want to use this project as an opportunity to see how we could explore Chopin's life. So we've designed our prizes to be the manifestation of our quest to represent and explore Chopin's life and his work. \nPrint. Chopin - The Listener's Companion. \nThe only thing better than listening to a Chopin Nocturne is following along to the music with images of his first edition prints, notes about the piece from the performer, and things to listen for. This listener's guide will contain a mix of all the above and more.\nThe guide will be printed on high quality paper using letter-press printing.\nDigital. Chopin: A Life In Music\nWe believe that a digital experience, optimized for a tablet, will be the best way to explore Chopin's music. We are thinking of this app as an extended version of the booklet, including all Chopin's music, original first edition scores, sheet music, videos, and notes about each piece.\nIn addition to shuffling through his music and recordings, we will create an interactive timeline so you can explore what he wrote, when, what was happening to him (and the world) at the time, and listen to his music while doing so. We'll also include information about his contemporaries, so you'll learn who was around at the time and what they thought of each other.\nThe app will be developed by Musopen's in-house dev team including our lead developers Ivan Anishchuk and Eugene Naydenov. They've built Musopen.org and a beta version of this iPad app.\n\nE-book. Classical Music - An Introduction\nGiven that we are asking for you to back a project about classical music, and many of you may not be very familiar with this genre, we'd like to create a primer to ease you into what makes this music so special, what to listen for, and how to listen to classical music.\nMusic\nAll of Chopin's music will be recorded in lossless FLAC, MP3, M4a in 24 bit 192kHz. As with the previous Kickstarter, this music will be hosted for free on Musopen.org, Box.com, Archive.org, and seeded via a BitTorrent link.\nVideos\n1080p videos of every performance + behind the scenes footage + interviews of the performers.\nPlease consider supporting us and spreading the word. We would love to tackle this with your help, and have it be just the beginning of what we can create together.\n- Aaron + The Musopen Team", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGiven our previous experience doing this, we're confident that this project will go smoothly, much more so than the previous. We will vet each individual musician and will hire 2 musicians for every single recording.\n\nThe biggest risk I see is the ability to include the two piano concerti. Given the level of quality we want this music to be at, we will be attempting the concerti last, which means either not including it or going with a cheaper orchestra. This all depends on how much we ultimately raise. It's not an easy choice for us, but otherwise it's almost necessary to have two 75k projects, one for the solo piano work and one for the concerti.

You'll get an email right after the Kickstarter is completed to let us know exactly what you want engraved, so plenty of time to change your name, think of the perfect message, or build up the courage to reserve one for your crush.\nReserve a tile, own a piece of one of the largest kickstarted civic projects in the world, and take a huge step towards + POOL with a floating test lab this summer.\n+ POOL started with a simple goal: instead of trying to clean the entire river, what if you started by just cleaning a small piece of it?  And what if you could change how New Yorkers see their rivers, just by giving them a chance to swim in it?\nA Giant Filter for the River\n+ POOL is designed to filter the very river that it floats in through the walls of the pool, making it possible for New Yorkers to swim in clean river water for the first time in 100 years.  The layered filtration system incrementally removes bacteria and contaminants to ensure nothing but clean, swimmable water that meets both city and state standards. No chemicals, no additives, just natural river water.\nThe pool will clean up to half a million gallons of river water every single day.  In doing so, + POOL will make a measurable contribution to the rivers of New York City.  The rivers are big, and this will be a great place to start cleaning them.\nA Pool for Everybody\n+ POOL is designed for all types of swimmers, bathers and hanger-outers, which is why it's designed as four pools in one: a Kids' pool, Sports pool, Lap pool and Lounge pool. Each can be used independently, combined to form an Olympic-length pool or opened completely into a 9,000 square foot pool for play. Its simple and iconic shape will mark the return to clean rivers in New York City.\n+ POOL by the numbers:\nPool Dimensions: 164' (l) x 164' (w) x 5' (d). Each arm is 32' (or four lanes) wide.\nPool Area: 9,300 sf\nPool Volume: 285,000 gallons\nDeck Dimensions: 205' (l) x 205' (w) x 8' (d)\nDeck Area: 14,700 sf\nWater Turnover Period: Every 6 hrs (2 hrs at Kids' pool)\nWater Turnover Rate: 707 gpm (259 gpm at Kids' pool)\nMax Daily Turnover Volume: 694,000 gallons/day\nReal-River Testing\nA huge and essential milestone in getting + POOL closer to the water is being able to test all the filtration materials in real-river conditions. To do that, we'll be building a mini, temporary and floating science-lab version of the + POOL that we're calling Float Lab. The Lab will allow us to test a combination of different materials right in the East River and assess the water quality across 19 different parameters, ensuring clean and safe water for swimming across all standards.\nFloat Lab This Summer\nIf our Kickstarter goal of $250,000 is reached, we'll be able to build the 35' x 35' Float Lab off the Brooklyn shore this August, giving everybody a chance to see and learn about how + POOL will clean the rivers.\nWe're working with a great team at ollolo in Brooklyn's Navy Yard for the fabrication and assembly of the lab. \nAfter testing is completed, we'll get back to work designing and engineering the rest of the project, from the structure to the showers, in preparation for review with the city and state.  There's still plenty of work to be done, but our big goal is to open the full, beautiful + POOL for everybody in the summer of 2016, just in time for the Olympics!.\n+ POOL is driven by the supporters, backers and collaborators that want to see the pool in the water as much as we do.  So we thought, what if we broke the pool into bite-size chunks and gave everybody a way to claim a piece of the pool for themselves?\nThis is a + POOL tile...\nOne of 70,000 tiles that will make up the deck, walls and floor of the future pool. If every single one is bought, the entire $15 million construction budget of + POOL will be funded from front to back.  That's pretty awesome.\nWe want everybody to be able to see, hold and keep their very own tile which is why when you reserve an individual tile here on Kickstarter we'll engrave you name on it and send you one in the mail this very summer.  And on opening day of the future + POOL, there will be a replica of your tile waiting for you on the pool with your name permanently etched into the history of making the world's first water-filtering floating pool.\nTile Goals\nIf the first 1,400 tiles are reserved here on Kickstarter, we'll be able to build the + POOL Float Lab in the East River this summer, testing all the filtration materials in real river conditions. This will push the project over the giant tipping point of getting into the water.\nAt 2,000 tiles, we'll also be able to open an exhibition and education space coinciding with the Float Lab..  It will be a public space dedicated to education and public involvement with workshops, discussions and real-time data.  It'll also be a great place to hang out near the river.\nAnd at 5,000 tiles, we'll not only pass the critical one million dollar mark, making it the largest civic crowdfunding project to date, but we'll be able to finish the custom filtration package.  It will be complete, and we'll have a never-been-done-before system ready to go.\nDuring this campaign, the first 5,000 backers to purchase their very own tile will receive two passes to First Dips, an exclusive week reserved just for backers before the pool opens to the general public in 2016.  It's our way of thanking you for reserving your tile early here on Kickstarter and it'll be the only time you'll get to swim with just your friends and fellow backers.  Everybody else will be pretty damn jealous.\nHave your name engraved on a + POOL tile for just 25 bucks!

You'll be our guest of honor and a major contributor to building + POOL for New York City.\nLaunch and Kickstarter\nWhen + POOL first started it was just a simple idea amongst three friends.  After launching our first Kickstarter campaign two years ago, we found out that we weren't the only ones that wanted this idea to happen.  We raised over $41,000 from 1,203 backers, surpassing our goal of $25,000 in six days.  It was overwhelming evidence that people wanted to see + POOL in the water.\nFiltration Testing\nBackers made it possible for us to test filtration materials along the East River and collect some of the most detailed water quality data the city has ever seen. We tested 19 different parameters for 10 weeks under the guidance of researchers from the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University and saw a huge reduction in contaminants across all counts.  The materials even cleaned on the worst days, right after big storms, proving that + POOL is starting to work.\nBuilt a Team...\nWe've continued working with some of the world's best engineers at Arup and some of the world's most innovative designers at IDEO.  We're working with environmental consultants at One Nature and have teamed up with both Storefront for Art and Architecture and Architizer to ensure that the project is designed and implemented in the best way possible.  We're proud to be working with such amazing people and groups and are honored that they share our vision in the design, engineering, development and implementation of + POOL. \nAnd Went to a lot of Meetings\nWe've been in hundreds of meetings with city, state and private organizations including NYC Parks and Recreation, DEC, Army Corps, Coast Guard, DOH, DCP, MWA, MAS, Riverkeeper, State Senator Daniel Squadron and Councilmembers Stephen Levin and Brad Lander.  We've learned from competitive and open water swimmers as well as families that simply want their children to have a great place to take swimming lessons.  We even got a call from a young girl who saw the pool online and wanted to know what time it was going to open in the morning.  It completely caught us by surprise and further cemented the need for + POOL to become reality. \nFamily\nFamily designs buildings like a museum in Finland, a housing block in Dallas, a pedestrian bridge in Slovenia and some tents on the Bowery.

It's on its way to becoming one of the largest crowdfunded civic projects the world has ever seen, and the fact that everybody can be a part of getting + POOL into the water is both incredible and absolutely central to the project. But like anything new and worthwhile there are some inherent risks and challenges that we'll face as the project continues to develop. We've brought together what we think is an absolutely incredible team of designers, engineers, researchers and strategists and have an amazing roster of advisors from the architecture, environmental, business and political spheres to guide us. With a project this large and this complex, there's still a lot of hurdles and unknowns to overcome before we're all swimming in clean river waters, but we believe the risks are well worth the reward of making our city even better and we're committed to getting + POOL in the water. Below are the main challenges that we'll face and what you can expect as the project continues to develop. \n \nDesign and Engineering - As is the case with any design project, things will evolve as the project progresses, as we learn more, and as the conditions that we're designing for change. Working with Arup, we have the full confidence and experience of one of the world's leading engineering firms that our goal of filtering river water is absolutely achievable. The challenge is in fact finding the BEST way out of the many that we're studying. This applies to the test pool the summer, and even to the tiles as the ones we'll send you may be slightly different than the ones that ultimately make it on the pool. So even though things may end up looking slightly different than above, the water will be clean and + POOL will be an amazing place to swim.\n\nFunding - When compared with most projects here on Kickstarter, + POOL is larger, more costly and will take longer to complete. And with any complex building project, from a kitchen refurbishment to a brand new city, budgets and estimates can change. We'll continue to do everything we can to keep costs in check and we don't expect to crowdfund everything in one go. It will take steps and time but we feel it's worth it to ensure that we can make the best pool in the world. \n\nPermitting and Approvals - Building anything in New York is complicated, let alone something in the civic realm, on the river, that has never been done before. Permitting is never guaranteed regardless of the scope of the project, which is why we've spent the last two years in hundreds of meetings to make sure that + POOL is designed to meet their requirements of the permitting agencies. The responses have been across-the-board positive, but we're still giving ourselves plenty of time for the approvals process. If we do get delayed because of permitting it will be a little upsetting, but we're pretty sure the rivers will still need cleaning the next summer.\n\nThanks, everybody, for building something amazing with us. \n\nDong, Archie and Jeff\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #32", "update_userinfo": "An Annual Update and Celebration", "update_content": "HEY FRIENDS,\nA quick reminder to RSVP for our event THIS WEDNESDAY, \"What's happening????\" at Tribeca Film Festival's screening room.\nWe'll be sharing the ins and outs of the project: where we're at in the long process with the City of New York, whats happening with the patent of the filtration system, and any other questions you have about + POOL and its realization in New York.\nThis summer, Tribeca Studios produced a documentary short that tells the story of + POOL to date, which we'll share at the event. is amazing because it's helping us reach larger audiences and raise awareness about + POOL, while directing audiences to share their desire to swim with the City of New York at swimintheriver.com."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #31", "update_userinfo": "REMINDER: Event this Wednesday @Tribeca Film Festival", "update_content": "Friends,\nYou've been there from the beginning.

I wanted to build it in the USA. So The Roost was designed from the ground up to be producible at medium-to-high quantities from equipment that one can run in a small production area. \nThe solution involves innovative manufacturing approaches using off-the-shelf components, a laser cutter, and hand-pressed rivets. No Plastic Injection molds were used in making the Roost. Half of the fun was finding innovative materials and processes to meet my manufacturing plan.\nKickstarter will be used to fund the manufacturing equipment purchase of the laser cutter, rivet dies and squeezers, mechanical presses, and other shop equipment. If the kickstarter is successful, the Roost factory will be well-equipped to produce medium-to-high volumes of Roosts for years to come!\nThe Roost is patent pending.\n______________________________________________________________\nDesign Highlights\nProblem: Getting your laptop screen to the correct height is inherently precarious because it will be at least a foot off the desk.  \nSolution: Using an innovative way of suspending the laptop from the base of the screen (as opposed to the conventional method of resting the laptop on a surface), The Roost literally \u201cclips in\u201d to your laptop to hold it extremely securely.  It is as stable as if your laptop were sitting on the desk.\nProblem: For the product to truly be useful, the product must be highly collapsible to fit into your bag / briefcase / backpack / etc.\nSolution: \nUsing two mechanical mechanisms: 1) a \u201cscissor lift\u201d that construction workers use to lift themselves 50+ feet off the ground combined with 2) the action of a conventional folding chair, The Roost holds laptops of any weight and greater than 13\u201d screen size, and folds down into a highly compact 1\u201d x 1.5\u201d x 13\u201d shape.\nProblem: The Roost must be extremely durable because it will be tossed around with your travel gear.\nSolution:\nThe Roost - Holding 132lbs of cinder blocks\nConstructed from Carbon Fiber and Delrin plastic, two of the toughest modern materials, the Roost was over designed to outlive your laptop.\n______________________________________________________________\n\nWho is using the Roost?\nBroadly, anyone who uses a laptop:\nCreative professionals, especially those that travel / work on location\nDesigners, Graphic Artists, Video Editors, Producers\nDJs, performing artists, musicians\nPhotographers\nWriters, Reporters, Social Media\nDevelopers / programmers\nStudents\nConsultants\nSales professionals\nGamers\n\nOther Uses:\niPad / Tablet Stand\nBook Stand\nSpecial Thanks:\nJelani Memory for his amazing video production work\nBlack Shirt Brewing Co, Denver, CO.

We'll figure it out.\nUPDATE: SONGS FROM ENDLESS FANTASY!\nHey everybody ( n_n)y \nchilling on a mystical beach hill\nWe are Anamanaguchi! We make emotional punk, pop & dance music using hacked Nintendos, Game Boys, and 16-bit soundscapes along with a full band. \nYou might know us from our tours across the US, maybe from PAX, or Lollapalooza, or maybe you heard our soundtrack to the Scott Pilgrim vs. the World video game, or you might know our music as the theme song to the Nerdist podcast-- or more likely you have no idea who we are! We're Anamanaguchi, sup :)\n*~*~*THE STORY OF THE ALBUM~*~*~\nENDLESS FANTASY (cover art by Andrew Strasser)\nSince the Scott Pilgrim soundtrack, we've been trying to figure out exactly what we wanted to do next. The next few years saw us going in 100 different directions of what we wanted our next album to sound like. Pete saw his influences jumping all over from j-pop producers like Yasutaka Nakata to 80's post-punk groups like Orange Juice. As months went by it shifted even more to a desire to romantically conjure settings from video game universes by sampling sounds from the Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask. Pete's capriciousness then sent him thinking back to the roots of the project, wanting to create an ode to the basement the band began in where he'd cover Weezer songs and played NES with his brother. Meanwhile Ary was off casually writing emotional songs about his cat, drum and bass tracks about Tokyo drifting, cute euro-beat fantasy snowboarding jams and a song about girls hiccuping.\nAry & Wolfie\nFor two years Pete lived in the same bedroom as the producer Gabe Liberti (two beds!) and would talk every night about what they loved about music - trying to help make sense of these various directions we felt the band being pulled towards. After many backyard discussions with Ary over Haribo gummies and Aranciata, gradually an idea began to form. All of these tangents we've been on for the past few years would fit perfectly together as one crystallized piece - each hyperbole balanced by an equal and opposite experiment. We couldn't sacrifice any of it or else that balance would be shattered, it had to be all 22 songs or nothing at all.\nPete & Gabe (producer) being roommates\nEveryone working with us (and also some friends!) said this was a stupid idea, but we wanted to stand by it no matter how arduous the process might be. It also turns out that most record labels aren't interested in helping out four weird dudes put out 22 songs of mostly-instrumental music made using sound chips from old video game consoles without making any compromises. So we refused some deals, weren't offered others to begin with, and decided to release the album on our own label, dream.hax.\nSo with passion as our driving force, we recorded, mixed, & mastered our new album Endless Fantasy over the course of 3 years without any help from a label. Trying to do this on our own and still holding it to a high standard is intimidating, but you can change that. We've gotten this far, but our ambitions for what this album needs to be don't end here. People keep on telling us our vision is wrong - we want to take the power out of their hands and put it in yours. This where we need your help!\nNow that the music is finished, we want to do everything we can to make this album as long lasting as possible. We want to tour this album everywhere we can, we want to create as much media around it as possible-- we want it to be more than just mp3s with cover art!\nteamwork (working 2gether)\n~*~*~GOALS 4 THE MOTHA-EFFIN' FUTURE~*~*~\nWe want to make a stronger connection with Endless Fantasy than just the music alone. We want to make media to surround the album to give it the context we think it needs to make the strongest impact possible. Among this includes making new music videos - creating our own tour lighting rig - collaborating with singers for vocal editions of certain songs - making some specific interactive web projects - designing and manufacturing new & interesting merch (and then giving it to you here!) - essentially, we'd rather have our fans be our record label than record labels be our record label at this point.\n*~*~*~*~#1 MUSIC VIDZZZ~*~*~*~\nWe were able to make one music video on our own means and we're pretty hyped with how it came out. We worked with Tim & Eric editors/ultra-buddies Daniel Gray Longino and Eric Notarnicola on a video for the song \"MEOW\" that managed to be as ridiculous as the track itself.\nWe have ideas for MANY more videos for songs off this record and we want to make as many of them as we can!! In order to do that we need to reach out to talented animators & directors which can get pretty expensive! Pixel artists, Hollywood directors, you know wassup.\nGOAL AT 50K: Music videos for \"Japan Air\", \"U n Me\", \"Akira\", and improved budget for \"Endless Fantasy\".\nMEGALONG STRETCH GOAL: Music videos are our top priority here, if we raise more funding, we will make MANY more videos!! The album has 22 songs and we have limitless ambitions for this. We'd probably even release a DVD for all of 'em, though by the time we do this it'll probably be cooler to just give out downloads and stuff :)\n*~*~*~*~*#2 BORING SHIT~*~*~*~*\nWe want Endless Fantasy to have the perks of being released on a big label - good distribution so that your friends can see it at stores, proper PR to let the videos we make be seen, and marketing to let people who've never heard of us know who we are :)\nWe know how important it is for music to be out there - some of us were lucky to grow up in towns with amazing weird record stores and their very existence shaped who we are today. It's hard for a weird band to get in a normal record store, and that's exactly what we want to accomplish!\nGOAL AT 50K: Pay for base-level marketing, PR & distribution for Endless Fantasy.\nMEGALONG STRETCH GOAL: idk maybe we'd rent a video billboard in Times Square and just put a cute kitty cat on it with no words.\n~*~*~*~*#3 TOUR LIGHTING~*~*~*~*\nMade by James!! (not ours tho!)\nJames is not only a mega-talented bass player, he's also a mega-talented electronics genius. He is the Donatello to our Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. He made the modifications to our tour Nintendos, and joined the band at the very beginning drawn by the idea of taking electronics apart and making them do what you want them to. \nJames!!!!!!! #heartthrob\nJames has since worked independently on many tour lighting setups for bands like RA RA RIOT and !!! (chk, chk, chk). Although we've been a band for nearly 8 years now, he's never had the opportunity to create anything just for ourselves.\nWe've performed with Ra Ra Riot's tour poles on loan before, but we can't do that forever. James has budgeted out a specific tour lighting rig JUST FOR ANAMANAGUCHI! \nHe'll be using principles of Pepper's Ghost (the effect used to make the 2Pac hologram) to project onto edgelit acrylic cubes reminiscent of our album cover.\nHere's James' basement lab.\nGOAL AT 50K: Cool light poles, projection cubes, LED displays, stuff like that!\nMEGALONG STRETCH GOAL: I asked James what he would do if the Kickstarter made double what we asked for, and he looked at his computer then back at me, made a wide-eyed face and then looked back at his computer again.\n~*~*~*#4 COLLABS~*~*~*\nPart of whats really cool about making art is about seeing what other artists do with the things you make! We want to reach out to producers for remixes, singers for collaborations on tracks, and all that kinda stuff.

A t-shirt unlike any other. A t-shirt that can tell you the story of its own creation.\nWhat\u2019s Planet Money?\nPlanet Money is a joint project of NPR and This American Life, which focuses on coverage of the global economy. Imagine you could call up a friend and say, \"Meet me at the bar and tell me what's going on with the economy.\" Now imagine that's actually a fun evening. That's what we're going for at Planet Money.\nSo wait, what does this have to do with t-shirts?\nAlmost every single t-shirt out there -- from the cheesiest vacation tank top to the fanciest boutique designer tee -- is the result of a complicated global odyssey. We will take you on that odyssey and document the route our t-shirt took to your back. We'll meet the people who grow the cotton, spin the yarn, and cut and sew the fabric. We'll ride on the cargo ships that bring our t-shirt from factories in Bangladesh and Colombia to ports in the US. And we'll examine the crazy tangle of international regulations which govern the t-shirt trade the whole way.\nCool. So what\u2019s it ...\nHold on, I\u2019m not done. Our t-shirt will have a cool little code on it that you can scan with your smartphone. It\u2019ll bring you to an interactive page where you can see photos of the people who made your shirt and follow its journey around the globe.\nSorry, what was your question?\nWhat\u2019s it look like?\nLike this:\nSizes available: Men's and women's S, M, L and XL.\nDon't worry about giving us your size when you pledge. After our project closes, we'll send you a form where you can specify size and gender.\nAlso, we CAN send you multiple shirts if you pledge multiples of $25.00 -- but only if the shirts are all going to the same address. (So just to be clear, if you pledge 50 bucks, you can order two shirts, 75 will get you three. But no matter how many you get, they all have to go to the same address. Sorry!)\nWhat does a squirrel have do with planets or money?\nWe thought about the design of our t-shirt like an apparel company would. What feelings, we asked ourselves, do we want the design to evoke? Well, we answered ourselves, as journalists we\u2019re always striving to cover the potentially frightening world of finance and economics in an accessible and fun way. And so we want our t-shirt to feel accessible and fun as well. What, we concluded, is more accessible and fun than a squirrel hoisting a martini glass!\nAlso, it's a visual pun -- a reference to the phrase \"animal spirits\" made famous by the economist John Maynard Keynes.\nIn the 1930s, Keynes wrote that most of our decisions \u201ccan only be taken as the result of animal spirits\u2014a spontaneous urge to action rather than inaction, and not as the outcome of a weighted average of quantitative benefits multiplied by quantitative probabilities.\u201d\nAs Planet Money's own David Kestenbaum put it recently: \"Keynes's idea was that there's more to the markets than just numbers, there are people and emotions making decisions. And to the extent that we are finding the human element in the very dry subject of economics, it's actually perfect for us.\"\nI\u2019m pretty particular about my t-shirts. It\u2019s not coarse and boxy is it?\nNo way. We\u2019re partnering with the t-shirt company Jockey. They tailored this t-shirt specifically to our needs. It\u2019s made of soft, lightweight, 100% cotton fabric. And the cut is super-sleek.\nWhere\u2019d you get this idea?\nThe inspiration came from an amazing book, The Travels of a T-Shirt in the Global Economy, by an economist named Pietra Rivoli.\nI was just pulling your leg with my earlier question about Planet Money. I\u2019m actually a huge fan. How do I get a shirt?\nSimple! You pledge $25 or more, and we\u2019ll send you one.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe challenges with a project like this are everywhere.

And these are just the challenges that we as journalists are used to dealing with. \n\nThen there are the challenges of, essentially, running a t-shirt company. We'll need to pay our suppliers, make arrangements for shipping and handling, and follow up with you all to make sure that everyone who ordered a shirt got one.

We successfully Kickstarted the first volume in 2012, and the response has been so positive--and the requests from readers so unending--that we\u2019re back to do it again.\nYou know the feeling: There are so many fantastic authors and great books out there that sometimes it\u2019s hard to know where to begin.\nSay you\u2019ve always wanted to read something by William Faulkner. You probably know a bunch of his books: The Sound and the Fury; As I Lay Dying; Light in August; Absalom, Absalom! Maybe you\u2019ve even come close to buying one. But every time you think about it, there\u2019s that big question:\nWhich should you read first?\nStart Here solves that problem. It tells you how to read your way into 25 amazing authors from a wide range of genres--children\u2019s books to classics, contemporary fiction to graphic novels. Each chapter presents an author, explains why you might want to try them, and lays out a 3-4 book reading sequence designed to help you experience fully what they have to offer. It\u2019s a fun, accessible, informative way to enrich your reading life.\nStart Here, Vol. 2 will be available both as an ebook (compatible with Kindles, iPads, Nooks, and a variety of other devices) and as a printed edition.\nWho is writing \u201cStart Here\u201d?\nStart Here will be written by a wide array of writers, critics, and bloggers who bring not only their expertise but also their passion for these authors. This combination of passion and expertise is at the heart of Start Here. Passion without expertise is unhelpful, and expertise without passion is uninspiring.\nWhat Authors Will Be Covered?\nSome of them we\u2019ve already planned, some we\u2019re still planning, and some of them we\u2019ll ask for your help in selecting.\nHere are some we know we are going to include: Jennifer Egan, William Faulkner, Anne Carson, Ursula K. LeGuin, David Mitchell, Toni Morrison, Alan Moore, John Green, and Philip Roth.\nHere are a few we\u2019re thinking about: Salman Rushdie, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Willa Cather, Nadine Gordimer, John Updike, Edith Wharton, and others.\nWho\u2019s on your wish list?\nWhere's the money going?\nThe proceeds will cover:\neditorial costs (compensation for contributors and behind-the-scenes work, software for book creation, legal fees, licensing)\npromotional costs (cover design, PR and marketing, special giveaway items)\nrewards & shipping (including print edition)\nadmin fees to Kickstarter and Amazon.\nWhat if you exceed your initial funding goal?\nOnce we meet our target, we\u2019ll add a second goal and five more chapters. If we meet that, we\u2019ll add another five chapters and another goal. Basically, your support will determine if the book exists and how many authors will be covered.\nWho Are You Guys?\nBook Riot is a community dedicated to the idea that writing about books and reading should be just as diverse as books and readers are.

What is this?\nI was about to sign a typical financing deal in order to get the money to make \"Wish I Was Here,\" my follow up to \u201cGarden State.\u201d It would have involved making a lot of sacrifices I think would have ultimately hurt the film. I\u2019ve been a backer for several projects on Kickstarter and thought the concept was fascinating and revolutionary for artists and innovators of all kinds. But I didn't imagine it could work on larger-scale projects. I was wrong.\nAfter I saw the incredible way \u201cVeronica Mars\u201d fans rallied around Kristen Bell and her show\u2019s creator Rob Thomas, I couldn\u2019t help but think (like I'm sure so many other independent filmmakers did) maybe there is a new way to finance smaller, personal films that didn\u2019t involve signing away all your artistic control.\nFinancing an independent film the traditional way often means having to give away your right to \u201cthe final cut,\u201d casting choices, location choices and cutting down your script to make it shoot-able on the cheapest budget possible. \nWhat if there is a different way?\n\"If you don't like how things are, change it! You're not a tree.\" - Jim Rohn\nOk, I'm intrigued. What's the story?\nPage 1...\n\"Wish I Was Here\" is the story of Aidan Bloom (played by me), a struggling actor, father and husband, who at 35 is still trying to find his identity; a purpose for his life. He and his wife are barely getting by financially and Aidan passes his time by fantasizing about being the great futuristic Space-Knight he'd always dreamed he'd be as a little kid.\nWhen his ailing father can no longer afford to pay for private school for his two kids (ages 5 and 12) and the only available public school is on its last legs, Aidan reluctantly agrees to attempt to home-school them.\nThe result is some funny chaos, until Aidan decides to scrap the traditional academic curriculum and come up with his own. Through teaching them about life his way, Aidan gradually discovers some of the parts of himself he couldn't find.\nIt was written by my brother, Adam, and me last summer.\nAdam and me.\nThe Soundtrack:\nThe Soundtrack to \"Garden State\" was more popular than I could have ever imagined. The album went platinum and won a Grammy. Music and score are very important to me, and I'll be using them in the same way in \"Wish I Was Here.\" One of the cool things about being a backer is that you can get access to weekly song picks by me, and be the first group to stream the soundtrack. \nI don't have the rights to put any cool music on here, but here's me doing a fairly decent beat-box:\nPre-visualization:\nI am lucky enough to be friends and collaborators with one of the greatest pre-visualization artists in the business, Colin Fix. Artists like Colin help filmmakers establish the look and tone of the locations and characters before going into production.\n\"Wish I Was Here\" has some very unique characters, and mine in particular has elaborate fantasies that I want to try to bring to life in a very specific way. When operating on a tight budget, it's super helpful to be able to gather around the art Colin and I have come up with in order to make sure the entire creative team is on the same page.\nA doodle of the Bloom Family I made for Colin:\n*Note: The film is NOT ANIMATED. These are character design sketches.\nCharacter Design Lineup by Colin Fix\nColin painted these two frames as research for the look of Aidan's opening fantasy sequence. Aidan's fantasy-self has a flying robotic-squire:\nEXT. FANTASY-FOREST SEQUENCE - NIGHT by Colin Fix\nEXT. FANTASY-FOREST SEQUENCE - NIGHT by Colin Fix\nSince he's the only crew member that's already working, I put all my direction into Colin:\nCinematography:\nLarry Sher has agreed to shoot the film. Larry shot \"Garden State\" and has since gone on to shoot all the \"Hangover\" movies, along with many other big comedies. Larry and I have very similar taste and together we established the look of GS.\nThe amazing cinematographer Larry Sher and me:\nWe were able to shoot Super 35 millimeter film on GS. In today's digital age, it's become harder and harder, and more expensive, to shoot film. If the budget permitted, I would shoot \"Wish I Was Here\" on film as well. There are several amazing digital systems we'd use if we couldn't afford film, but as a camera geek who went to film school, I'm sad film is going away. Only the biggest directors these days get a chance to shoot it.\nProduction Design:\nA Production Designer is in charge of the overall look of the movie. They collaborate closely with the Costume Designer to ensure the film has a cohesive tone. They oversee all sets, set decoration, locations, props etc. If all goes as planned, \"Wish I Was Here\" will be designed by Judy Becker. Judy is one of the most amazing designers in the business. Here are some of her most recent production design credits:\nSilver Linings Playbook\nGirls (Pilot) \nShame\nThe Fighter\nBrokeback Mountain\nGarden State ;)\n\nOk... Why Kickstarter?\n\u201cThe definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.\" - Albert Einstein\nI want you to be my financiers and my audience so I can make a movie for you with no compromises. I know it's risky, and I don't know if it's going to work, but here are a few reasons why I think it's worth it to fund via Kickstarter. \nFinal Cut: \n\"Final Cut\" is the industry term for who has the final say on how the movie will be edited. A lot of financing deals require that the final cut go to the money people, NOT the director. Most films these days are tested in front of \u201ctest audiences\u201d to see how an audience likes what you\u2019ve made. This is sometimes very helpful, as you can get a sense of when the pace is too slow or when certain jokes aren\u2019t as funny as you thought they were. However, it can also be destructive, as a financier with final cut may use a note from the test audience to force you to make changes to the film that go against your gut. You ultimately have no right to fight against these changes because you have signed away those rights in order to get your money. As a film-lover myself, I always want to see exactly what the filmmaker intended.\nCasting Choices:\nTraditionally, in order to procure your financing, a filmmaker will often have to choose from a list of pre-approved actors with whom the financier is willing to make the movie. Although there are often many wonderful actors on these lists, you may not see the actors you had in your mind to play those parts. The lists are compiled of actors who\u2019ve been in films that have had large successes overseas. Their names are put into an algorithm, and a computer calculates how much money the financier will be able to pre-sell the foreign distribution of the film for based on that actor\u2019s past successes. Bored yet? Basically, you have to cast who they want, not who you want.\nLocation Choices:\nThis film is set in Hollywood. Bizarrely, it is very expensive to shoot in Los Angeles. So unless I have the budget to afford to shoot here (where it takes place), I\u2019ll have to shoot the film in Vancouver or Georgia or Louisiana and fake it to look like LA. I was told we\u2019d just \u201croll a few palm trees around.\u201d This happens all the time, and we could make it work... and no offense to all those places, but wouldn\u2019t it be amazing to be able to shoot the film where it takes place?\nCuts for Budget:\nEvery film makes cuts to trim the budget; that\u2019s completely sensible. But there are always places where, with a little extra money, the film could be better. In \u201cWish I Was Here,\u201d my character's elaborate fantasy sequences are one place that extra money would strengthen what shows up on the screen, as I could shoot those in the amazing and surreal locations I picture in my mind.\nWrap it up, Braff, I have stuff to do...\nI look at it like this: Come join this little club. Join for whatever you can. And then, together, this lil club's gonna make a really cool movie, and you'll have made it happen. If you've liked the stuff I've made so far, I know you're going to love this. \nWhether you end up with a rad t-shirt (soft as a kitten's taint) or an invite to a special preview screening, you'll know that without you, this movie never would have gotten made. (*Yes, there will be a secret handshake and code word for the club.) (No, it's won't be \"Eagle\" or \"C-bear\".)\n\"You had me at Hello,\" what do I do?\nTo become one of our backers, just click on the big green button to the right of our video.

The producers and I are truly doing this all ourselves. Lack of distribution can also be a blessing. We want to make this film the same way we made \"Garden State,\" without a distributor or financier demanding we adapt it to fit their needs. \n\nOur goal is to debut the film at the Sundance Film Festival. If you fund the project, we intend to start pre-production right away, shoot this August, and finish the film in time to submit it to the festival. There's a very accomplished team behind the scenes: two of my producers from \"Garden State\", Stacey Sher and Michael Shamberg, and a supremely talented cast and crew including Larry Sher and Judy Becker. \n\nYour goodies like t-shirts and posters for helping us make this possible will be sent out by a professional fulfillment company. Many elements of the rewards will be fulfilled well before September of 2014, which is when we hope to release the film and have all of our premieres and screenings. For those of you who are attending an event or joining us on set, we will do our best to keep you in the loop on our schedule.\n\nTHE FINE PRINT (stuff my lawyer wants me to say)\n\u2022 For those of you visiting our set, we anticipate shooting in August in Los Angeles. However, this has the potential to change. We will keep you updated so you can plan ahead to visit us.\n\n\u2022 If you become an extra ($2500 reward) or receive a cast credit ($10,000 reward), you must be a US citizen or have a US work visa, and not be a member of SAG/AFTRA. \n\n\u2022 You must be over 18 or accompanied by a parent or legal guardian (who will count as your plus one) to attend the premiere or visit the set. Extras must also be over 18. \n\n\u2022 The content of the voice and video messages are at your direction, but at my discretion. I reserve the right to refuse to say or do what you request if I find it inappropriate.\n\n\u2022 Some rewards may require additional paperwork. If you are appearing in the film, you will have to sign a release. \n\n\u2022 My final cut of the film may have to be further edited in certain cases to adhere to the laws in the country which it is being viewed, or for different types of media. \n\n\u2022 All shooting locations, including Comic-Con, are subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the amount of money we are able to raise and the particular locations giving us the right to shoot. \n\n\u2022 This fundraising campaign is all subject to applicable Kickstarter rules/regulations, movie guild rules and applicable law. if any of this conflicts, we will work with you in good faith to give you a substitute reward.\n\nTo sum it up, movie making is a crazy business, with a lot of unknown factors. We start with a script I'm really proud of. Then, we assemble the best team possible, get insurance, and make contingency plans. It's impossible to guarantee everything will come together exactly as planned, but in the end, we will have created a movie that hopefully all of us can be proud of. It's a great journey, and I thank you in advance if you can help make this ride possible.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 3659, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1869987317/wish-i-was-here-1", "project_name": "WISH I WAS HERE"}}, {"backer": "Dan Chan", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "We've reached our goal and we couldn't have done it without your help!

That's because their roommate is the only one doing any of the work and paying all of the bills. Fed up with their immaturity and irresponsibility, he moves out unannounced and leaves the friends facing certain eviction.\nSmart Guys is a six-episode situation comedy about friendships, quarter-life crises, and video games. Paul, Nick, and Josh are our dimwitted, down on their luck heroes, who until now never had to face adulthood. To make matters worse, their ex-roommate Pete has become a diabolical businessman bent on dominating the video game industry along with destroying the guys' friendship.\nPaul, Nick, and Josh figure the best way to show Pete they'll be fine without him is to beat him at his own game (because they're smart guys *WINK*). So the trio sets out to create the world's greatest video game, but the first of many obstacles in their way is they know nothing about making a video game.\nIf you're a fan of Arrested Development, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, or Workaholics, Smart Guys will have you laughing out loud in no time!\nSmart Guys was co-created by Paul Ritchey and Josh Henderson, and was co-written along with Nick Murphy, and series producers Luke Brown and Mike Sadorf. The series will also star Ritchey, Henderson, and Murphy.\nRitchey and Murphy are the co-creators of the YouTube channel ContinueShow, and along with Henderson, host the weekly show Continue?. Their loyal fan base has grown to over 100,000 subscribed viewers who have gained Continue? over ten million total views. The show has also spawned a successful podcast, a series of YouTube personality collaboration sketches, and a number of holiday specials.\nIn addition to Continue?, Ritchey, Murphy, and Henderson have partnered up with Brown and Sadorf before to produce several parody movie trailers, all of which have become viral hits for YouTube channels such as Machinima and Gamervision. Their award-winning God of War Indie Movie and The Legend of Zelda (1987) trailers, along with their countless other original shorts, have accumulated over five million combined views.\nWe realize the creative freedom and direct line of communication afforded to us by the Internet is unparalleled in any other form of media distribution. Smart Guys will provide the chance to expand our current audience and will present them with storytelling elements they may not have seen from the web series format before. Smart Guys will also join other contemporary online scripted narratives in establishing proof of concept for online serialized original content.\nBy supporting the Smart Guys Kickstarter of course! While the amount being ask to fund Smart Guys may seem like a lot, there are dozens of unseen production costs for a project of this magnitude. Two of the most important aspects are the ability to create a convincing setting for the characters and the production's ability to remain on schedule. Both will be achieved by generous donations from you! The larger the budget Smart Guys has to work with, the more immersive the story and the more timely the production. \nNow for the fun part: when you donate towards the Smart Guys production, you will receive rewards exclusive to this Kickstarter as tokens of our appreciation!

Thank you! Keep up the support and let's hit our next goal soon!\nWait... What are Stretch Goals?\nStretch goals are extra content that we can accomplish if the funding goals are met. For instance, if we hit 200,000, then we will have enough resources to implement a 4 player battle mode! It\u2019s not to say we will won\u2019t see these features in the future some time (don\u2019t be too worried! ), but if we reach the stretch goals, we can promise them with confidence! Here is a description of the stretch goals:\nMusic Player\nSound Test! Adds an in-game music player that lets you listen to all of your favorite Shovel Knight tunes. Collect song scrolls in the levels and take them to the bard, who will play them for you with perfect accuracy! We might even have some special, hidden songs... You\u2019ll also be able to hear all the SFX samples, but we don\u2019t know how the bard does that.\nAchievements\nWe tend to like achievements because they change the way you play the game! This stretch goal will add a bevy of achievements to ALL VERSIONS of the game.  These aren\u2019t just going to be stock achievements; they will be creative and wonderful. Can you beat Shovel Knight without losing a life? Prove it!\nNew Game Plus\nStart the game over with your weapons and items fully upgraded. However\u2026 enemies are going to be tougher, resources more scarce, and new challenges may arise. With new game plus, it\u2019s like a whole new game! Kind of! +!\nPlayable Boss Knight\nPlay the full game as a member of the Order of No Quarter! If we meet this stretch goal, we\u2019ll hold a vote to see who it will be. Expect the game to play differently! For example, Propeller Knight could have the ability to hover for short distances, but would be a low health \u2018glass cannon\u2019 of sorts. Even the story and dialog will change a little bit to reflect the changes!\nLinux / Mac Versions\nWant to play Shovel Knight on your weirdo computer? Many folks have asked for Linux and Mac versions. We hope to support Mac and Linux either way, but this goal makes it happen for sure, and in a more timely fashion (hopefully in 2013!).\nGender Swap Mode!\nWe want Shovel Knight to be enjoyable by boys and girls of all ages, everywhere. With this mode, the main characters\u2019 genders will be swapped, giving us a chance to do it before the internet has a chance to. The story will also change a bit to reflect the changes. Can you defeat the Evil Enchanter?\nChallenge Mode\nAdds a comprehensive batch of challenge rooms  to Shovel Knight. In this mode, Shovel Knight will be tasked with a variety of mini-quests like \u201cdefeat all the enemies!\u201d or \u201creach the goal in time!\u201d. Expect things like pacifism challenges and other rules-benders\u2026 and expect some tough-as-nails challenges too!\n4 Player Battle Mode!*\nWe\u2019ve talked a ton about multiplayer for Shovel Knight. While full-on multiplayer is out of the scope of this project, we could totally do 4 player couch co-op battles! Imagine playing as Shovel Knight ( or any of the extra playable knights ) and duking it out in the arena! Several modes would be ideal:\n\u00b7         Cash collecting, where you fight for treasure that appears in the level. Knock your buddy to make gems fall out and collect them!\n\u00b7         Racing, where all players would have to make their way to the end of a stage\n\u00b7         Last man standing, where the only goal is to slash mercilessly\u2026 to the bitter end!\n*This is couch co-op only, not online. We hope to bring this feature to all platforms, but the 3DS isn\u2019t guaranteed because multiplayer is Wi-Fi only.\nPHYSICAL.ACTUAL.REAL.BOX.\nIf we reach this stretch goal, then we will make a physical box of the game, which will be mailed free to backers pledging at the $50 tier and above! Plus, ALL backers will receive the digital version, to print or view at your leisure. NOTE: This box art is only a mockup. We might have a surprise or two for the final box art! Johnny Vila, your prayers have been answered :P\n3rd Playable Boss Knight!\nCall this goal unoriginal, but we don\u2019t care. We\u2019re too excited to play as another boss knight! Let\u2019s get to this pledge level and have one more knight (who will be chosen by the community) make the cut! Rally! For the Order of No Quarter!\nAll Bosses Playable in Battle Mode!!\nIf we reach this goal, the entire Order of No Quarter (including the Enchantress herself!) will step into Battle Mode, for the ultimate battle royale. Wild new combat styles abound! Play as your under-appreciated favorite and beat up the more popular knights that got voted into the main campaign!\nShovel Knight is a sweeping classic action adventure game with awesome gameplay, memorable characters, and an 8-bit retro aesthetic. It's a hot mashup of new and old that may remind you of Mega Man, Castlevania, or Dark Souls! You play as the eponymous Shovel Knight, a small knight with a huge quest. Shovel Knight has come to this valley with two goals: to defeat the evil Enchantress and save his lost beloved. He wields a ShovelBlade: a multipurpose weapon whose techniques have now been lost to the ages. Always honest and helpful, Shovel Knight is a shining example of the code of Shovelry: Slash Mercilessly and Dig Tirelessly!\nBut, between Shovel Knight and his beloved stands a cadre of villainous knights. These terrible foes, known as The Order of No Quarter, have been dispatched to prevent Shovel Knight from reaching the Enchantress, and will pursue their mission at any cost.\nIf you love games with perfect platforming, beautiful art, infectious music, crazy bosses, and real heart\u2026 Shovel Knight is for you! If you don\u2019t, then what? How could you not be into that stuff? Keep reading, you\u2019ll come around!\nEvery great game needs a great set of baddies, and Shovel Knight\u2019s are a doozy. Shovel Knight\u2019s Nemesis is The Enchantress, a mysterious and powerful conjurer. Her Order of No Quarter has swept over the land, stationed in locations Shovel Knight is sure to visit. In order to get to the Enchantress, he\u2019s gonna have to beat them all!\nWe love themed bosses and themed levels; this love is on full display in Shovel Knight! Each knight in the Order has been lovingly crafted to have a distinct look, theme, and personality. These epic boss battles are really going to shine! We already love our villainous bunch, so let us share them with you.\nThis is Polar Knight: the Sabretooth to Shovel Knight\u2019s Wolverine. He\u2019s guarding a stranded ship in the frozen south. Titanic and terrible, he is the largest and most brutish of the Order of No Quarter. Some time in the past, Shovel Knight and Polar Knight have crossed Shovels before...\n\u2022 Pros: Wields Snow Shovel, Doesn't feel cold but is quite considerate!\n\u2022 Cons: Annoying laugh ( it's like water torture )!\nAnd Propeller Knight! He commands the Enchantress' flying machine with the cocksure attitude of a sky pirate! With his Heli-Helmet, he can zoom short distances with ease. Shovel Knight encounters Propeller Knight on top of the aircraft as it zooms through the sky; earth fights against air in a true battle of elements!\n\u2022 Pros: Talented Fencer, Mechanical Heli-Helmet, Debonair!\n\u2022 Cons: Arrogance, Lightweight, Outrageous Accent!\nSometimes, the bomb is mightier than the sword. Deep in the recesses of his alchemical lab, Plague Knight perfects concoctions both poisonous and explosive. Toxin, disease, and death are his playgrounds. Even his comrades give Plague Knight a wide berth, because he spreads more than just the common cold. With an array of mysterious and magical bottles at his side, Plague Knight could be considered the black sheep of The Order of No Quarter.\nPros: Maniacal scientific mind, fearlessness bordering on recklessness\nCons: Physically weak, short stature, shy at parties\nMole Knight... the shovel may rule the confines of man-made gardens, but in the wild, the titan of tunneling is the mole! Mole Knight embraces this truth wholeheartedly. With his modified drop-forged armored claws, he mockingly tears through the earth with brute strength! Mole Knight calls the subterranean Lost City his home... an ancient abandoned metropolis. Shovel Knight must pass through the Lost City, but chances are slim he won\u2019t be challenged to see who is truly the master of digging.\nPros: Great eyesight, shrewd, high endurance\nCons: Obsessive personality, gets sweaty in armor\nTinker Knight! Some knights love rushing into the glory of battle, ready to crush the skulls of their enemies! Tinker Knight is not one of those knights. He does his fighting before the battle begins, laboring on diabolical devices that do his work for him. The wrench is the tool of his trade, doubling as an engineering device and a melee weapon. Some are quick to dismiss Tinker Knight\u2019s lethality... usually just before falling victim to one of his mechanical monstrosities!\nPros: Gregarious demeanor, hard worker\nCons: Rough hands, works long hours, always out to prove himself\nWe\u2019re going to be sharing more of the Order of No Quarter as the Kickstarter proceeds, so check in often!\nShovel Knight is rendered in a pumped-up 8-bit style. We are adhering to the NES color palette, but adding many modern touches. For example, We have tons of scrolling background layers, giving a real illusion of depth.\nOur pixel animation and attention to detail is top-notch. Every character, even minor foes like these wizards, have painstakingly crafted animations and personalities.\nDetailed, living backgrounds and animation! Big, beautiful pixels! Just look at the screens!! With Shovel Knight, we are developing a next-gen 8 bit game!\nLike all of our favorite games, Shovel Knight has been designed gameplay first! We are especially dedicated to precise control. Pixel-perfect hit boxes, toenail jumps, and mobility mastery are our obsession. That wonderfully elusive 'feel' of great control.\nWhen thinking of the initial concept, we started by saying \u201cwhat if we built a whole game around a downward sword thrust? It would be great to sink into dirt, attack foes by stabbing from above, and maybe even bounce on hard ground! Ok, digging as a major mechanic\u2026 how about it\u2019s a shovel instead of a sword? That way, we can have him use the flat blade of the spade to flip things over and slash!\u201d\nFrom that gameplay concept sprung all of the ideas for Shovel Knight. We've learned from games like Mother 3 that a game becomes much stronger when graphics, story and tone work together to unify the gameplay experience!\nGreat music is central to great games, so it\u2019s with incredible excitement that we can announce that Jake \u201cVirt\u201d Kaufman is composing the soundtrack for Shovel Knight! For those of you who don\u2019t know, Jake is one of the most talented audio guys in the game biz, contributing on games from Mighty Switch Force to Contra 4 to Shantae. His most recent work on Double Dragon Neon has garnered as much praise as the game itself!\nNugget love\nTrue to our sense of collaboration, our team likes to involve audio early and often in development. For Shovel Knight\u2019s music, we\u2019re taking an NES+ style approach, adding sound channels and detail for a fuller sound that\u2019s still authentic. In addition to the main theme highlighted in the trailer, check out the track written for Pridemoor Keep, the level we\u2019ll be debuting at PAX!\nIf you liked that, you should just go listen to everything on his website (virt.bandcamp.com) because it\u2019s amazing. And check out the Official Shovel Knight Soundtrack Album backer reward below! WE LOVE JAKE! \nYacht Club Games is an independent game developer started in 2011 by Sean Velasco and a crew from WayForward. We are a fun-loving bunch of gaming geniuses who have dedicated our lives to video games ever since we saw our first pixels. However, our serious and solemn goal is to make really awesome original games that fuse modern and retro sensibilities, and we have the pedigree to prove it! Our team is comprised of top talent that has worked on some amazing titles, including Contra 4, A Boy and His Blob, Thor: God of Thunder, Mighty Milky Way, BloodRayne Betrayal, and most recently, Double Dragon Neon.This is our maiden project as Yacht Club Games, which means we are determined to impress.\nSo what are we all about? We want to create fun and challenging gameplay. We want to both tug at your heartstrings and delight you with levity and charm. We want to make games that you play together with friends and family. Most of all, we want to give everyone the same collective types of game experiences that have defined our generation. It\u2019s such an exciting time to be a fan of games; the industry is experiencing a renaissance and creativity is flourishing. We are so, so excited to develop games that we love, in hopes that you love them too!\nShovel Knight is currently nearing the end of preproduction. This means that the game design has been written, the main character designs and story have been created, and we have a plan for moving forward. We have an early build of the game that proves out our game mechanics and technology; you can see some footage in the trailer and we'll also be at PAX East!\nHowever, many things are still up in the air. Enemies and objects need to be designed and drawn. Audio, Animation, and Backgrounds need to be crafted. Lastly, we need to polish everything to a mirror sheen. Basically, we have what you saw in the video. Now we need to make the whole game.\nSo, we think this is a great time in the process to involve the community. We have a skeleton to build on, but we want you to be the meat!\nVideo games are expensive and time-consuming to develop, so the usual way to get one made is to acquire funding from a publisher. We have had great partnerships with publishers in the past. However, working with a publisher has its drawbacks; you are beholden to them, and they are generally risk averse. We wanted to go to the community, because Kickstarter provides us a unique opportunity to interface directly with our fans and make a game where fun and quality are always the top priorities.\nWe believe in Shovel Knight. We know that the final game is going to be great. We\u2019re so sure of this that we quit our full time jobs to work on it. We\u2019ve poured a massive amount of time, money and effort into our labor of love, but it\u2019s not enough to finish the game. In order to make Shovel Knight a reality, we need you!\nWe have amazing rewards that we are as excited to give out as we are to make! Check \u2018em out below!\nThe Game!\nGet a digital PC copy ( PC, LINUX, MAC, STEAM ) of Shovel Knight, hot off the digital presses! Digital!\nAlso, ALL pledge levels $15 and above will be able to choose on which platform they want their stalwart blue hero!!!\nInstruction Booklet\nThe final Instruction book will have illustrations, not sketches!\nAh, the Instruction Booklet\u2026 the comfort food of books. We still have a few of our favorites, the pages worn and cramped with notes. Together with you, we can bring the lost art of instruction booklets back to the limelight! The Shovel Knight Instruction Booklet is full of important safety information, awesome character art, enemy lists, hints, and space for notes. We are taking the utmost care to make sure that these booklets are true to their predecessors, right down to the way they smell.\nWe want the kids of today to feel the excitement of reading the booklet in eager anticipation of the game\u2019s release, so we are going to send you the booklet FIRST, so you can read it and reread it, and go crazy with anticipation!\nShovel Knight Coffee Table Book\nThis is a Book of the Game! The goal is to make something fun and funny, an entertaining compendium of the whole Shovel Knight production. Design Discussions and sketches! Concept Art and Illustrations! Game Maps, pixel animation sequences, and work-in-progress versions of everything! As we develop Shovel Knight, we\u2019ll be chronicling the process and we want to put it all here on display. As a crazy indie startup, you know there is going to be a lot of juicy stuff!\nShovel Knight Official Soundtrack\nWe already told you how awesome Jake Kaufman's music is. Hopefully you are thinking that Shovel Knight is looking pretty awesome too. Well, now you can own the combined awesome with this pressing of the Official Shovel Knight Soundtrack! Laid delicately into a bejeweled case, this CD and accompanying liner notes will be adorned lovingly with customized art. This is what you want. It\u2019s what we want!

We have obtained dirt ( at no small expense, mind you! ) from each area of Shovel Knight\u2019s Kingdom; Gearwork Dirt from the base of the Clockwork Tower, Besmirched Dirt from the Village of Plague, and more! The dirt you receive will be chosen at random, but trust us when we say that all of the dirt is very special. Get it fast, because when it runs out, it\u2019s gone. We\u2019re not made out of dirt here!\nDesign Hangouts\nNow you can take part in our design process! We will be broadcasting on a private video channel available only to our beloved Kickstarter backers! You can be a fly on the wall and listen to us as we hash out the finer details of the design and work through problems, or you can jump in and tell us what to do! There is no guarantee we will listen, but many can attest to our receptiveness to ridiculous ideas. Budding game designers, armchair directors, and trolls can all have lots of fun!\nOriginal Concept Art / Game Design Card\nSuper Design Index Cards!\nThe Yacht Club loves index cards: we use them to quickly communicate ideas! Puzzle setups, boss patterns, and sketches of new enemies; they are hastily scribbled onto cards and passed around! It\u2019s completely awesome, and it also means that by the end of a project, we have a lot of really cool index cards lying around. We are going to send you an original one of these cards! You can specify if you want a design card or an art card. Maybe you\u2019ll get the very first sketch of an enemy that's in the final game!\nYour Likeness In the Game\nAppease your ego by having us painstakingly hand-craft a pixel version of you, which will appear somewhere in Shovel Knight. Send us a photo and we will recreate you in 8-bits and immortalize you forever\u2026 but where will you appear in the game? We know where we are going to put you, but it\u2019s a secret for now!\nSuperDeluxe Canvas Poster Signed by The Yacht Club\nThis is a really super high-quality 24x36 poster, signed by the team and sent to you. Suitable for framing ( you had better frame it! ), this poster will feature the classiest art we have by the end of the project.\nDirector For A Day!!\nAs Director for a day, you will get to design a major character, boss, midboss, or scenario. We\u2019ll take you through the whole process from conception to completion, helping massage your design into the game with probably hilarious results! Check out the details below! NOTE: ( Actual implementation time may be longer than one day )\nYacht Club Sleepover!\nCome to sunny Southern California ( or if you are already here, just drive over to us ) to meet and spend the day with the Yacht Club! We\u2019ll do a studio tour, get a fancy meal (or drive-through if you don\u2019t have a collared shirt, but you can order whatever you want and we'll get like a whole extra bag of hot sauce), and then go back and play games for as long as we can stay up! Maybe we could also wear our jammies and talk about who we have a crush on! Oh, or if you would rather not, that\u2019s ok too\u2026 we\u2019ll take our cues from you I guess.\nYacht Party with the Yacht Club\nIf there is anything the Yacht Club loves as much as making games, it\u2019s partying hard to celebrate a game launch. At this reward level, you will join us in SoCal with other Yacht Club superfriends on an hours-long voyage in celebration of Shovel Knight\u2019s release! All of this is going to be on a Real Yacht on the Real Ocean, which we will be renting for the occasion ( the yacht, not the ocean ).\nListen as we regale you with tales of the game dev trenches! Stumble about as you try to get your sea legs! Sing karaoke and be merry, because tonight, my friend, we are all superstars!\nDid I mention our special musical guest Jake \u201cVirt\u201d Kaufman, who is going to play live?\nIt\u2019s gonna be epic as hell.

Colonel, who sacrificed everything by disobeying the chain of nuclear launch commands; changing the fate of the world as we know it. \nFew people know of him...yet conceivably hundreds of millions of people are alive because of him. Stanislav Petrov, a retired Soviet military officer, is credited with preventing the start of World War III and the nuclear devastation of much of the Earth.\nOn September 26, 1983 he was the commanding officer on duty at the Soviet nuclear early warning center, when the system falsely reported the launching of five nuclear missiles from the United States.  In the harrowing moments that followed, Petrov overruled the system's warning, personally declaring that it was a false alarm. This monumental decision prevented an erroneous retaliatory nuclear attack on the United States and its Western allies. \nThis false nuclear attack warning is cited by CIA analyst Peter Pry as \"the single most dangerous incident of the early 1980s.\"\nHis courageous decision deserves recognition and by bringing his story to a wider audience, we believe we can invigorate the global discussion on nuclear elimination. The events of September 26, 1983 remains a stark example of the precarious situation we still find ourselves in as we head towards the future. Mistakes do happen, and it will always be up to human beings to make the final choice.\nOver the past 5 years, we have been weaving together the fabric of Stanislav\u2019s story and the impact his decision has had on each and every one of us. We\u2019re currently in the final stages of post-production, so we\u2019re reaching out to you for support in helping us cross the finish line. \nOn the film set during re-enactments of that fateful day in 1983\nDuring Stanislav's visit to the USA to receive his award at the United Nations, he is greeted by actors Robert De Niro and Matt Damon.\nStanislav visits with legendary anchorman, Walter Cronkite.\nHELP US BRING STANISLAV'S STORY TO LIFE.\nThe Soviet military did not reward or honor Stanislav Petrov for his actions. His once promising military career had come to an end. Like a Greek tragedy, he looses everything; his job, his wife, his dignity. \nWHY SHOULD I HELP YOU MAKE THIS FILM?\nWe would like to see this film play a meaningful role in the growing debate over nuclear elimination. Our hope is that by bringing to life the true story of Stanislav Petrov, we can remind the world of the ongoing threat of nuclear weapons.

We\u2019re Wild Child, an indie-folk band from Austin, TX.  Last year the seven of us came together, formed the band, and wrote, recorded, and released our debut album, called \"Pillow Talk.\"  To make that album, we scraped together modest funds, borrowed gear from friends, and recorded it ourselves.  We\u2019re awfully proud of it, and we\u2019ve been so privileged to get to watch the songs take on a life of their own, as we\u2019ve been able to share them with and play them for audiences both here in Austin and across the country.  It\u2019s truly been one of the most amazing experiences of our lives.\nWe\u2019ve spent the last year touring together, practicing together, growing closer and closer as a family, both musically and personally.  We\u2019ve had the opportunity to do some amazing things; we had an official showcase at SXSW, got invited to play ACL Festival and Blues On The Green, shared stages with bands such as The Avett Brothers, and, best of all, we were lucky enough to meet thousands of brilliant, beautiful, kind, and endlessly generous new friends throughout the adventures we\u2019ve had traveling around the States, packed like seven sardines into our trusty tour van.\nThere\u2019s one other thing we\u2019ve been spending the last year doing: writing new music.  A lot of it.\nIn preparation for our second album, we\u2019ve written a whole slew of new songs, narrowed them down to a list of twelve, and are finally all set to head back into the studio, record the new songs, and put them out in the world as our second full-length album.  We\u2019re calling this one \u201cThe Runaround.\u201d  Words can\u2019t express just how excited we are to share it with you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIn order to make it happen, though, we need to ask for some help. While the scrappy way we put together our first album will forever be a proud and happy memory for all of us, we\u2019re now in a place where we need to get more professional in order to reach the next level as a band, grow our fan base, and get to the point where we\u2019re able to make and play our music for a living. That means recording our next album in a real studio, with a real producer and engineer. We need to be able to have the album mixed and mastered professionally. We need to be able to press it on both CD and vinyl. We need to be able to release it on the strength of a proper P.R. and radio campaign. All that stuff is expensive. Frankly, we can\u2019t afford it (not by a long shot).\n \nIn other words, we need some money. Which is why we\u2019re here, turning to our friends, fans, and families, and asking for your help.\n \nWe have an amazing team in place, ready, willing, and able to make this album everything it has the potential to be. That team will be led by Ben Kweller, a musician we\u2019ve been huge fans of for years, who has signed on to produce \u201cThe Runaround.\u201d \n \nThis album is so very important because it will mark a new beginning for us as a band. We\u2019re eager to make Wild Child our full-time occupation, and the momentum we\u2019ve been able to build over the last year, thanks to all of you, has put us in a position where we\u2019re actually knocking on the door of achieving that goal. But whether or not we\u2019re able to turn this into a career and keep making the music we want to make for years to come hinges a great deal on the success of this album. We wholeheartedly believe that this is the best music we\u2019ve ever made together; if you liked \u201cPillow Talk,\u201d you\u2019re going to love \u201cThe Runaround.\u201d For it to take us where we\u2019re hoping oh so badly that it will, though, the album has to be recorded, mixed, mastered, promoted, and distributed professionally. If we fail to reach our Kickstarter goal, we\u2019ll be forced to make serious sacrifices to the quality of the recordings, the creative and technical teams behind it, the PR campaign, and the distribution efforts once it\u2019s finished. And when a band is self-releasing an album rather than doing so through a major record label, all of those things are totally crucial to whether that album finds its wings or falls flat on the ground.\n \nYour contributions will give us a real, legitimate shot at success in a nearly impossible industry to succeed in. By \u201csuccess\u201d we don\u2019t mean that we\u2019ll all become rich; we mean simply that we\u2019ll have the creative independence to be able to make the music we want to make, and to keep doing so for a long time to come. That\u2019s our one and only goal for Wild Child. We\u2019ve come so far already, because of you; now we just need that extra little push to help get us over this hill.\n \nThank you, sincerely, for taking the time to read this, and for the tremendous generosity, love, and support you've all shown us from day 1.

Steve Mazur, our sound engineer, usually gets there early and goes back through what we did the previous day. We spent the first couple of days with just Kelsey and I live tracking all of the songs. We tried recording them a couple different ways but the magic was lost if we did it any other way besides uke and vocals together. To make us feel more comfortable, we track mostly in our Tiger and Bunny Onezies (see photo). We are extremely happy with the way everything is sounding. Ben Kweller has been great to work with! He is very encouraging and has many a great idea. He believes in the project and has been a wonderful addition to the crew. We have all the drums and keys tracking and are going to start on bass and cello tomorrow. Typically we spend 14 hours a day in the studio. Their is a lot of downtime that we fill with razor scootering and old school flash games. By the end of this week we should have most of the album tracked! Our plan is to have a single out for sxsw2013. We will keep you posted on any developments. We just finished the kickstarter shirt design and will be getting those out soon. (see picture). Thank you so much for your participation to \"The Runaround\"."}, {"status": [{"Project funds successfully": "641 backers pledged $40,372"}, {"Project launches": "NOVEMBER 16, 2012"}]}], "comment_no": 8, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wildchild/wild-child-is-making-a-new-album-with-ben-kweller", "project_name": "Wild Child is making a new album (with Ben Kweller)"}}, {"backer": "Dan Chan", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Thank you all who've supported us thus far! With your help we raised more than $3,000 in the last day. If we raise an extra $3,000 (a total of $18,000) in our final 24 hours, we will add an additional screening at our most spectacular venue\u2014Open Road Rooftop in the Lower East Side. Spread the word, encourage your friends to pledge, and let's get an extra show on top of our favorite venue!\n50+ screenings - 12 outdoor locations - live music - after-parties - and much much more \nOver the last 16 years, Rooftop Films has screened thousands of new, independently produced films in amazing scenic spots all across New York City. But we can\u2019t do it without your help. \nWhat\u2019s that you say? But summer 2013 is so far away? It is our mission to make our events as enticing and unforgettable as possible and creating that experience is a 365 day a year job. Though summer feels far off we at Rooftop are well on our way in planning our next great season. Support Rooftop Films now so we can expand our events and continue to do screenings at our biggest and most popular venue--Open Road Rooftop. \nWhat we do: \nOur current work includes gathering thousands of submissions from filmmakers, seeking out new and exciting venues, and coordinating travel for our feature filmmakers from around the world. And of course we are busily doing what we do best, creating inventive engaging programs by not merely showing movies, but enhancing our screenings with--rock bands, steel drum orchestras, discussions, free food and drink, video installations, ventriloquists, dance parties, death metal, chess tournaments, live wrestling, swordplay, and even robots imported from around the world. \nAnd once the summer does arrive, we are setting up events all over the city. At Rooftop we don\u2019t screen in theaters but in unique urban spaces. These events are complicated endeavors: moving truckloads of equipment; setting up giant screens, laying down thousands of feet of cable; and shepherding thousands of people up and down stairs and in and out of unique spaces. And then, after a few spectacular hours, we take it all apart, load it back into our trucks and drive off into the night to get ready to do it all again the next day. \nWhy we do it: \nAs a non-profit, Rooftop does all of this with a small, passionate, dedicated staff. We are a family and we dedicate ourselves to creating a unique, special experience for you--our extended family. We want you to hear up and coming bands in unforgettable locations, see films you might never have heard about otherwise, and meet fellow audience members and hang with filmmakers at our after-parties. It is our mission to keep these shows and these experiences accessible to all, and that is why each year we add more free shows and keep our admission prices as low as possible for our ticketed events. \nWhat can you do: \nTo create these experiences for you at the level that you expect from Rooftop (and we expect from ourselves) can be difficult and as we continue to keep our ticket prices low, our costs go up each and every year, and so we need YOUR support to keep the organization running.\nIn particular, we need your help so that we can continue to present shows at our most popular\u2014but also most expensive\u2014venue. The amazing Open Road Rooftop rests atop New Design High School in the Lower East Side and is truly a sight to behold. The space is huge\u2014it takes up an entire city block\u2014and it offers gorgeous wraparound views of the entire city. Best of all, the entire roof is decorated with graffiti murals produced by the students in collaboration with legendary street artists.  \nThere is no cooler place to watch a movie in all of New York City. But, unfortunately it has become considerably more expensive to put on screenings at this venue. Without support from our fans, we might have to discontinue our events in this amazing location. \nAnd we don\u2019t want that to happen. That is why we have put together this Kickstarter campaign. Of course, everyone who contributes is eligible for some great rewards, including packages from some of the outstanding distributors and organizations that we work with, as well as discounted Rooftop Films 2013 memberships and many more unique options. \nFor as little as $60 you can gain access to EVERY regularly priced Rooftop Films Summer Series event. That\u2019s a lot of great music, films, beer and fun, at an incredible price.\nFor $500 you will get a Rooftop membership and also have your name on one of the chairs at our venue\u2014Rooftop Style! Our in-house artist will graffiti paint your name on one of our classic folding chairs, so that when folks sit down in that chair they will be reminded of your support for Rooftop.\nIf you give $500, we will treat you to a private dinner with one of our talented filmmakers. The last time we offered this prize, one of our donors got to have dinner with Lena Dunham (before she was quite so famous), so help out Rooftop Films and you can get to know one of the up-and-coming talents whose work we\u2019ve premiered. \nMore prizes will be added, so check out what we have to offer and please, donate to the Rooftop Films Kickstarter, spread the word on Facebook and Twitter, and help us to make Rooftop Films 2013 Summer Series even more spectacularly successful and beautiful experience for you.\nAbout Rooftop Films: \nSince 1997, Rooftop Films has grown from a single screening on a roof in the East Village into one of the most dynamic film institutions in the world. As a non-profit organization, our mission is to engage and inspire diverse communities through film. We fund new movies by emerging independent filmmakers, teach classes to budding young filmmakers, and enable dozens of screenings with equipment rentals at low-cost. And, most importantly, we have expanded our screenings to all five boroughs of New York (and beyond). Each summer we attract massive crowds and widespread media attention by showing amazing new movies to tens of thousands in spectacular outdoor spaces. Rooftop Films is a vital support system for independent filmmakers, and our reach and ambition have grown with each successive year.\nVIDEO CREDITS: \nPrincipal Photography: Irwin Seow\nVideo Music: \"Jacket Pocket\" by Rooftop alumni CRINKLES", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a non-profit organization we will always face the challenge of relying on the support from our backers to sustain Rooftop Films.

Remember?  Books in which... an adventure is chosen??\nThese three things got mashed up together into one BASICALLY AMAZING BOOK full of JOKES and also SWORDFIGHTS and GHOSTS and AWESOME AS A MASS NOUN.  But don't take my word for it:\nUPDATE: TO BE OR NOT TO BE IS NOW THE PERFECT GIFT!\nWhile we won't be delivering the books in time for Christmas, if you pledge $30 or more, you unlock a Kickstarter-exclusive Holiday Hamlet ecard that can be sent directly to your gift recipient.  You can read about that here!  It's the perfect last-minute gift for anyone on your list (assuming they are good at waiting for things) (and also like to read)!  Also we've unlocked lots of new prizes at each reward level: be sure to check the updated list!\nWHAT MAKES THIS BOOK AWESOME??\nA few things:\nIF YOU LIKE SHAKESPEARE:\nMy friend: it is exactly as awesome as you remember, only now you're playing the main character instead of watching someone else just PRETEND to be him.\nAlso unlike Shakespeare I didn't skip over the pirate scene in Hamlet.  You get to fight PIRATES.  With SWORDS.  And yes OF COURSE you can choose which body part you cut off.  Why would you write a book where you can't do that is my question.\nIF YOU HATE SHAKESPEARE BUT STILL HAVE TO READ IT:\nYOU WON'T HATE HIM ANYMORE.  Honest!  This is great literature in what has to be the most accessible, friendly format ever.  If you ever struggled with wondering what was going on and what people's motivations were in the play, you will totally understand everything once you play through this book, assuming you make the same choices Shakespeare did when he played it.  That doesn't mean this book is written for children.  It just means it's easy to understand someone's motivations when you're the one making the decisions!\nHey speaking of that, making the same choices Shakespeare did will be easy as there will be little Yorick skulls beside the \"canonical\" choices.  So if you want to stick to the plot of the play, that's not a problem!  It's super easy!  But I'll warn you: Shakespeare's choices didn't lead to the best ending for the characters.  Not by a long shot.\nWhile the book itself is told in modern language, for each of the big speeches, you have the option to say it in the original beautiful and fancy language, or you can have told in modern language, like with Hamlet rapping it or whatever.  IT IS TOTALLY YOUR CALL.\nIF YOU LIKE THE POTENTIAL OF READER-DRIVEN NARRATIVE AND HAVE BEEN FRUSTRATED IN THE PAST:\nYep, I hear you.  The interactive books of our youth often suffered from arbitrary plotlines and capricious death.  This book puts you in a real, consistent world where your choices matter.  Also there are ghosts.  Also you can play as a ghost.  Also you can haunt the planet for generations because GHOSTS DON'T DIE.\nWHOAH REALLY??\nYep!  In fact, the first choice you make is to choose your character, and each character has their own storyline.  Storylines, actually: dozens and dozens of storylines.  You can play as Hamlet, his girlfriend Ophelia, and his dad Hamlet Sr, who (SURPRISE) dies on the first page and becomes a ghost.  And then we make fun of you for dying on the first page, but you can become a ghost and must INVESTIGATE YOUR OWN MURDER that you TOTALLY SLEPT THROUGH because you got SLEEPY IN AN ORCHARD. (Shakespeare wrote this part, I can't help it.)\nOphelia's adventure is as well-thought-out as Hamlet's, but rather than being a hero suffering from crippling inaction, you are a smart, self-sufficient woman who knows what she wants and is totally rad 100% of the time, and also you are dating a PRINCE.  You can choose what you want to do with your life: help your boyfriend who's crying about a spooky ghost, or I don't know TAKE DOWN INTERNATIONAL TERRORISTS INSTEAD??  It's nuts.  It's awesome.  Oh my gosh.\nIF YOU HAVE NO INTEREST IN HAMLET AT ALL BUT LIKE FUNNY JOKES:\nThen I can assure you this book is still totally awesome and chock full of those things you like.  You can (AND WILL?) love this book even if you've never had any particular interest in to being or not to being.  This is a book written for adults who like only the most awesome of things.  That is you.  I know it. \nI've used the story of Hamlet as a starting point, but a) that's already a great story because it ends with pretty much everyone in it getting stabbed in the body and b) the story can go in all sorts of fun, crazy directions when you make a choice that Shakespeare didn't.  \nTELL ME MORE ABOUT THE BOOK!\nThe book itself is already written: it's 80,000 words of comedy and mayhem that I lovingly crafted together myself over the past year.  80,000 words is about what you'd call an \"actual book-length book\".  So why the Kickstarter?  One reason, really:\n\nWe are going to decide how amazing this book is going to be.\n\nThe more money we raise, the better the book will be.  Paperbacks and hardcovers and nice paper stock are a given, but we'll also be adding PICTURES.  And not just any pictures: PICTURES DONE BY SOME THE BEST VISUAL ARTISTS AND ILLUSTRATORS ALIVE TODAY.  I say this without hyperbole, and as proof offer up this alphabetical list of Amazing People Who Are Doing Pictures For This Book, Look At All These Amazing People, I Love Them:\nAaron Diaz (Dresden Codak)\nAlex Thomas (Star Wars: The Old Republic)\nAndrew Hussie (MS Paint Adventures)\nAndy Runton (Owly)\nAnthony Clark (Nedroid)\nBecky (Tiny Kitten Teeth)\nBraden Lamb and Shelli Paroline (Adventure Time, Ice Age)\nBrandon Bird (What Nat Saw, so many amazing paintings)\nBrian McLachlan (The Princess Planet)\nCarly Monardo (so many good things)\nChip Zdarsky (The National Post, Extremely Bad Advice)\nChris Hastings (The Adventures of Dr. McNinja)\nChris Jones (Snowflakes)\nDanielle Corsetto (Girls With Slingshots)\nDavid Hellman (Braid, A Lesson Is Learned But The Damage Is Irreversible, Second Quest)\nDavid Troupes (Buttercup Festival)\nDave Kellett (Sheldon)\nDavid Malki (Wondermark)\nDustin Harbin (Dharbin!)\nDylan Meconis (Family Man, Outfoxed)\nEmily Carroll (The Prince And The Sea, so many others)\nEmily Partridge (Mount Pleasant Comics)\nEthan Nicolle (Axe Cop)\nFaith Erin Hicks (Nothing Can Possibly Go Wrong, Friends With Boys)\nJeff Rowland (Overcompensating, Wigu)\nJeph Jacques (Questionable Content)\nJess Fink (Chester 5000 XYV)\nJim Zubkavich (Skullkickers)\nJohn Allison (Bad Machinery, Scary Go Round)\nJohn Campbell (Pictures For Sad Children)\nJohn Keogh (Lucid TV)\nJohn Martz (Heaven All Day, Drawn.com)\nJon Rosenberg (Scenes From A Multiverse)\nKate Beaton (Hark! A Vagrant) (she did all spot illustrations you can see in the video and on this page!)\nKate Leth (Kate or Die)\nKazu Kibuishi (Amulet, Copper, Daisy Kutter),\nKC Green (Gunshow)\nKean Soo (Jellaby)\nKris Straub (Broodhollow, Chainsawsuit, Blamimation, Starslip)\nLar deSouza (Least I Could Do, Looking for Group)\nMarlo Meekins (all the beautiful pictures)\nMatthew Inman (The Oatmeal)\nMeredith Gran (Octopus Pie, Adventure Time: Marceline and the Scream Queens)\nMike Holmes (True Story, Bravest Warriors)\nMike Krahulik (Penny Arcade, co-founder of Child's Play)\nMike Maihack (Cleopatra In Space)\nNoelle Stevenson (Nimona, Gingerhaze) (she did the cover too!  It's going to be AMAZING, you will totally see it if you keep reading)\nRandall Munroe (XKCD)\nRay Fawkes (One Soul)\nRaynato Castro and Alex Culang (Buttersafe, Katamari Comic)\nRebecca Clements (Kinokofry, Ruffle Hall)\nRosemary Mosco (Bird And Moon)\nRyan Pequin (Three Word Phrase)\nSam Bosma (Turtle Soup)\nSam Logan (Sam And Fuzzy)\nScott Campbell (The Great Showdowns, Double Fine Action Comics)\nSteve Wolfhard (Cat Rackham, Adventure Time)\nTony Cliff (Delilah Dirk)\nTyson Hesse (Boxer Hockey)\nVera Brosgol (Verabee, plus storyboards for ParaNorman and Coraline!)\nWes and Tony (Amazing Super Powers)\nZac Gorman (Magical Game Time, all the pretty pictures)\nZach Weiner (Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal, plus Trial Of The Clone!)\n... AND MORE (surprise artists?  YES)\nWHAT'S THE MONEY GOING TOWARDS?\nIf we reach our goal for the book, I'll be able to release the book as a professionally-edited, professionally typeset, professionally-designed beautiful volume with a single illustration commissioned from each of these artists, each rendering a different way your story can end.  And the more money we raise, the more deaths get illustrated, until we have all 110 deaths done!  You can die a lot in a book like this, and I want to make each time something to look forward to.  I want it to be a treat.\nIn the video, I've included images showing each artist's style, and in some cases, an actual detail from an illustration I've already commissioned from them.  It is a SNEAK PEEK (assuming this project reaches its funding goals and is a success, otherwise it is just TANTALIZING GLIMPSES INTO A WORLD THAT WAS NOT MEANT TO BE)\nThis book will be published with help from Breadpig, who have a proven track record in bringing awesome into the real world.  They're the publishers behind super rad, super quality books like XKCD: volume 0, SMBC: Save Yourself, Mammal! and The Most Dangerous Game, and most recently, Zach Weiner's own chooseable-path gamebook also launched here on Kickstarter, The Trial Of The Clone. \nHOW DO I KNOW THIS BOOK IS AWESOME THOUGH??\nWell, I can tell you I think it's my best work so far.  And while you can't read this book just yet, pretty much everything else I've ever written is online for free!  I mentioned a bunch of it at the top of the page, but there's still more, like B^F, where I reviewed the insane novelization of Back to the Future, page by page, and my Twitter account, where I tell jokes that are short because it's Twitter, that's what it's there for!\nBUT ALL THAT ASIDE, I've worked to include every amazing thing possible in a book like this.  There's loops, alternate endings, secret paths and things that I'm pretty sure haven't even been done before in the medium.  Also, instead of a play-within-a-play to trap the conscience of a king, there's an \"an-adventure-is-chosen\" book within this \"an-adventure-is-chosen\" book, which you read while playing as King Claudius reading this nested book!  It's a whole separate book contained within this book, with cover and illustrations done by Andrew Hussie.  It's kinda the best?\nFor every 5K we raise, I'll post another section from the book!  We'll all choose what path we take... TOGETHER.  So you can read some of it that way too!\nTELL ME A BIT ABOUT THESE REWARDS\nEvery reward level gets you a DRM-free digital download of the book.  $15 is all it takes!  And this is highly appreciated.  But if you want to contribute more, there are some fun things I can offer in exchange!  Because things have been going so well, every tier threshold now includes TWO brand-new, never-released-anywhere Dinosaur Comics ebooks, so it's three books for the price of one.  PLUS if you donate a little extra, we'll throw in things like a plush Yorick skull (cutest ever!), an amazing multiple-path bookmark designed for this multiple-path book, awesome stickers and TATTOOS, a choose-your-own cover reversible dust jacket, a poster showing a map of the entire choice-structure of the book (beautiful, lose yourself in it), an audiobook version, all the way up to custom comics and custom little adventures starring YOU that I will write and that will be super rad extreme.  Keep reading to find out more about the rewards and what's left to unlock!  These are priced to raise money for this publishing project, but they're still pretty good deals too! \nNot everything reward is listed in the tiers over there to the right (they can't be edited once they've started) but rest assured you'll be getting all the prizes you've earned here.  I made a page that shows an up-to-date listing for each tier!  And the more money we raise, the more new rewards get unlocked that'll be automatically applied to people who have already contributed :o\nWHAT IF WE RAISE MORE MONEY THAN WHAT'S NEEDED?  DO AMAZING THINGS HAPPEN?\nYep!  If the book reaches its goal, yep, there's plenty of motivation to keep going!  I've got lots of plans for awesome things we could do to make this book the BEST EVER.  They include:\n$20,000 = UNLOCKED!!! Base goal, book printed w. 30 illustrations.

All of our programs are open to anyone in the world.\nLA Game Space is a nonprofit center for videogame art, design, and research. It is a place for game innovation, education, and exhibition; where all of us can play and make and study and showcase games.\nOur galleries will host large-scale EXHIBITIONS, interactive installations, performances, and retrospectives that can only be achieved at a space like this. We will be sharing catalogs, exhibition documentation, and the conversations surrounding gallery events online for everyone's benefit.\nOur SPEAKER SERIES will feature new dialogues with both traditional and nontraditional game-makers. Our WORKSHOPS will introduce newcomers to the medium and explore new processes and perspectives with experienced creators. Events will be archived and available (for free) online. They will also be livestreamed, and a moderator at the Space will enable worldwide, remote participation.\nRESIDENCIES are the beating heart of the Space. The residents will be creators from diverse backgrounds working collaboratively to create experimental game projects. LA Game Space will provide residents with work space, exhibition opportunities, and feedback from an equally diverse group of bright minds. Our goal is to free residents from the limitations often presented by commercial game development.\nGAME RESEARCH LABS will enable live gameplay recordings including useful metadata such as button presses, pulse rate, face-tracking, and eye movement. These recordings will be made available online for researchers worldwide. The lab will also provide access to a wide variety of platforms and devices\u2014both historical and contemporary\u2014and support experimental hardware and interface projects.\nWe've been working on this project for over 3 years.

Remote participation will be offered for our live streaming workshops and presentations via an online moderator, and all events will be watchable online for free even long after they happen! We'll be posting everything we can online including documentation of exhibitions, the residency program, and the conversations surrounding them.\nIf you care about free information and open archives, you will love our initial research lab project to create an open-source video game experience archive. Since video games are an active medium, it is not enough to archive the games themselves. We will be recording video game playthroughs, along with useful metadata such as button presses, eye-tracking, and pulse-rate\u2014and then archiving this data online for anyone to access.\n\u201cWhen you contribute to this Kickstarter campaign, you are not only receiving great rewards\u2014you're providing essential funds for LA Game Space and you're creating a resource that will produce interesting, exciting games for years to come.\u201d \u2014David Surman, Pachinko Pictures\n\u201c\u2026help shape the future of the greatest art form forever\u2026\u201d \u2014Stick Skills\n\u201cIt\u2019s a project that could redefine the idea of what it means to be a game maker.\u201d \u2014Kill Screen\n\u201cIf people like this are so behind it, you know, it's probably worth getting behind.\u201d \u2014Kotaku\n\u201cHead along to the Kickstarter\u2026this is one of the important ones.\u201d \u2014Hookshot Inc.\nDANIEL REHN is a researcher and creator of media/electronic art including video games.

I started re-evaluating how I approached each day.  Quickly, I was able to see when a couple of days would go by when I hadn't done anything remotely interesting or outside my typical routine.\nWe have a tendency to pull cameras out when we're doing something fun or interesting, but we probably don\u2019t think to record when we're just sitting at home watching TV.

If you asked me about a particular year\u2014say, 2007\u2014I really couldn't go into detail about it.  Sure I remember where I lived and where I worked.  I could probably find some photos to remember a couple of notable events by, but what about all the days in between?\nWhat did I do then?\nJust because we didn't do anything world-shaking one day, doesn't mean we should forget that day ever happened.  Perhaps use your less-enthralling days to inspire you to do something cool tomorrow.  Instead of letting the days, months, & years blend together into a hazy mush, make each day have meaning!

Their roots are in financial software, but they broke out of their corporate shackles three years ago to pursue more freedom in the types of projects that they can apply their talents to.  They've been fantastic to work with, and have been a closer partner with me on this project than I ever would have imagined. We've had hours of conversations debating the finer points of the project itself as an exercise, and the app design is a great reflection of the soul of the project as a result of that.\nAdditional thoughts\nDigital Cameras have made it easy to capture our lives, so most people are over doing it. And just because we can, doesn't mean we should. The limitations of rolls of film used to force us to prioritize what was worth capturing & what wasn't. I believe we should record less, & live more. Ruthlessly record only what's most important.\nSure people have been doing projects like these with photographs for years, but movement & audio are crucial to remembering a moment.  A photo can't capture my dad's voice\u2026 his laugh\u2026 or the way my mom's expression changes when I surprise her.\nThis project has produced an interesting side-effect: it encourages me to do at least one interesting thing every day.\nSend your compilations directly to social networks.\nI rarely capture the best moment of a day.  A lot of the seconds you see are actually from before or after a moment I want to remember, but seeing the moment I did capture still brings me back.  Trying to record the perfect second puts too much pressure on myself, and becomes a chore.  Wouldn't it be better to fully live an experience, than risk missing it while trying to capture it?\nWriting things down on a journal just doesn't generate the same results as actually having an audible/visual trigger to jolt your memory.\nI personally don't add filters, and I almost entirely shoot in first person perspective because I want to remember things exactly as I saw them with my own eyes.\nI like to think of each second as a \"Save Point,\" as if my past was a really complex video game.  Each \u201csave\u201d allows me to return to where I was and how I felt, and to connect the dots to remember un-captured events that transpired between any 2 recorded seconds.\nMy Story\nFebruary 20th, 1981 \nI am born in Peru. \n1987 \nMy family moves to New Jersey.\n1996-1999 \nI spend my high school years making 3D computer animated short films for fun.  At this time I begin to come into the fullness of my geekdom and movie buff-ness, and develop a passion for story telling, so short animated films become my way of exorcising those creative demons.\n2000-2004 \nI move to Brooklyn and enter Pratt Institute of Art and Design as a Computer Animation major.  My time is spent in being mesmerized by extraordinarily talented artists and I am immersed in non-stop inspiration.  While other animation majors students focus on courses in that field, I can't help but explore classes in a spectrum of artistic disciplines, including film, graphic design, and photography.  By the time I conclude my last class, I\u2019ve realized a most important lesson: all knowledge is connected.\n2004-2006\nI start working in advertising.\n2007\nI discover\u2014and become addicted to\u2014TED Talks.  Like many people who are drawn into the world of TED Talks, it becomes a life goal for me to be worthy of that stage someday.  To have an Idea Worth Spreading.\n2008\nI spend my rare free time working on personal creative projects and teaching classes at schools like Pratt & NYU.  One of these projects is directing a music video composed of 45,000 photographs.  The video ends up on the front page of Digg, Gizmodo, and Wired, and is staff-picked by Vimeo.  This is an exciting, exhausting time for me, but I\u2019m not in a situation that allows me to dedicate myself fully to this kind of work.\n2009\nI'm still in advertising\u2026 constantly working long nights and long weekends. I find myself increasingly dissatisfied creatively.  My social life is nonexistent, and don't get to spend enough time with my family.\nAnother 100+ hour work week.\nOctober 2009\nI watch a TED talk by Stefan Sagmeister\u2014The Power of Time Off.  My life is changed forever.  In his talk, Sagmeister (also a Pratt alumni) explains how his creativity has benefitted from shutting down his studio every seven years and taking a year off from work.  I'm instantly inspired.  I immediately start crunching numbers and looking at my savings.  I figure out how much I will have to save in order to take a frugal year off from work, and start saving saving saving.\nFeb 20th, 2011\nI turn 30 years old! I quit my job!  I start a year off from work so I can do all those things I\u2019ve never had time for, like travel, spend time with my family, and focus time on my own personal creative ideas.\nThe first of these ideas is a project I call \"1 Second Everyday.\"  The concept is simple: every day I record one second of video\u2014something that will help me remember that day.  I then begin chronologically compiling these tiny slices of my life into a single, continuous video.\nMarch 2011\nThe 1 Second Everyday idea begins as a fun way for me to chronicle my year off, but it quickly grows into something more important.  It allows me to easily reflect on my life and to look back at my decisions.  I start re-evaluating how I approached each day.\nAfter only a few weeks of compiling clips, I\u2019m able to look at the video and identify instances when several days go by without anything remotely interesting or outside my typical routine occurring.  It starts encouraging me to wake up & seize the day.\nI decide to continue doing this for the rest of my life.\nMarch 27th & 28th, 2011\nI forget to record a second. It torments me, but I learn a valuable lesson: when you're not doing anything interesting, it doesn't occur to you to capture the moment.\nApril 15rd, 2011\nA once in a lifetime opportunity pops up on my Facebook feed.  TED decides to hold the first ever TED talk auditions. I have doubts about anything in my life being worthy of the TED stage, but I\u2019m plagued by the thought that if I don\u2019t apply, I\u2019ll regret it for the rest of my life.\nApril 23rd, 2011\nIt occurs to me that my 1 Second Everyday project might be an \"Idea Worth Spreading.\"\nApril 25th, 2011 \n(thank to the 1SE project, I now know exact dates for these notable moments)\nI post my one-minute audition video to TED with just minutes to spare before the deadline.\nMay 6th, 2011\nA dream comes true, and my life changes forever.  I receive an e-mail from TED that out of hundreds of submissions, I'm one of 17 (including Reggie Watts!) to be chosen to audition live on stage at a special TED event in New York!  \nMay 24th, 2011\nTED talk day. Many fly in from around the world to audition, but I only have to take the subway.  I've never been more nervous.  Worst-case scenario\u2026 I tell myself to just speak from the heart.  I walk off stage convinced that I was horrible.  I unintentionally close off my talk by saying that I'd like to build an App that would make this easy for anyone to do.  Ultimately, I\u2019m happy just to have done my best and pleased that I now have a photo of me with a TED sign behind me. I\u2019m convinced it'll be my last Facebook profile photo ever.\nPhoto Credit: James Duncan Davidson\nJune 6th, 2011\nI fulfill a lifelong dream to drive around the USA to the West Coast, return through Canada\u2026 and do it slowly.  My friend Schoneck and I head off, and will not return to New York until 95 days later.\nJune 15th, 2011\nI get a phone call from TED, asking if I'd like to come speak at TED2012. I freak out!  Somehow, I\u2019m able to keep it a secret for the rest of the year.\nOctober 26th, 2011\nA catastrophic event hits my family.  I don't forget to record a second every day.  It devastates me.  Learn a valuable lesson, when you're going through horrible times, it doesn't occur to you to capture the moment\u2026 but my 1SE project forces me too.  \nDecember 24th, 2011\nAfter 2 months in the hospital, my sister-in-law returns home in time for Christmas.  In the months that follow, I'm grateful that I kept recording 1SE.  Reflecting on the bad times allows me to better appreciate the good times.  Before 1SE, this wasn't easy to do.\nJanuary 11th, 2012\nThe secret is out.  TED announces the speaker program for TED 2012. Now I can tell my friends and don\u2019t have to freak out alone!\nJanuary 25th, 2012\nFinally, after a long absence, I fly back to Peru to spend time with family.\nFebruary 20th, 2012\nI turn 31. It's a wrap for the first year of my lifelong 1SE project.\nFebruary 27th, 2012\nThe TED conference begins & I'm utterly overwhelmed in every conceivable level.  I meet some personal heroes of mine included Bill Nye (the science guy).  I mention to him how nervous I am about speaking at the end of the week.  He replies, \"if you weren't nervous, it wouldn't be worth doing\".\nMarch 2nd, 2012\nOne of the best weeks of my life comes to a close as the TED conference concludes, and I give my TED talk. \nTED 2012: Full Spectrum.

We just need your funding help to get this thing out of development and onto your phone!\nThe Future\nMy first priority after the completion of the iPhone App is to get an Android version out as well.\nAfter that\u2026 well...

I did it for a full year before I started using my own experience to design an App that would make it extraordinarily easy for anyone to do the same with their own life.\n\nWe've been hard at work on this App for several months\u2014making sure all the technical hurdles were out of the way before we launched this Kickstarter campaign, so that we could guarantee prompt delivery of the App & show it off in action.\n\nAt this point 80 - 85% of the base functionality is in the App. We still need to add that last 15 - 20%, which consist mainly of social integrations and the overlay of text on exported videos. Once that stuff is roughed in, we have to go back and polish everything in the app\u2026 the interactions, animations, layouts (so they match our designs), etc. \n\nFinally we'll put it through as rigorous a testing period as we can, trying to squash any remaining bugs before we submit to the Apple App Store. \n\nThe biggest challenges we've faced have been with the manipulation of video itself - mainly adding/overlaying text to the video. This has taken a lot of engineering discovery time, and thus far has not been solved when exporting videos. We've run into other strange things that have forced us to change course from the initial plans - a good example of this is that we initially thought we'd be able to use the native camera, but apparently it violates the Apple ToS to have an app launch the camera in Landscape mode, so we ended up having to build our own camera module. Although we believe this will work in our favor long term.\n\nA potential risk to our App delivery date (before 2013) could be the App Store approval process. Also, if we can't get the text overlay worked out in time. But we're confident we can.

Though there will be a wide range of genres, we will be also keeping true to the spirit of the original soundtrack.\n\nIn order to achieve such a monumental task, a roster of over 40 veteran musicians (along with several talented newcomers) are contributing their music skills.

Everyone will be receiving books signed by Becky and Sohmer that will include bookmarks, a dust jacket, and an original print. \n\nSo what is The Bear?\nTo say Sohmer's son loves animals is an understatement. It was then a simple choice to make the art in this book using all the animals he loves. From dogs and rams and owls to genets and chinchillas and numbats, (Yeah, he knows what that is) we've used a variety of fun and interesting animals to accompany the moments portrayed in the book.\nWe've made a wonderful, hardcover book with 52 glossy pages of illustrated content. The cover is a soft fabric, with the titling embossed in a reflective white.\nWe've posted several of the images before, on our Facebook page, on the BeHance site and we have some of them for sale as canvas prints in our shop. But we should probably share a few more with you here. Oh, and in case you have any confusion over the rewards, scroll down a ways and you'll find details on each of them.\nWho are your creators?\nSome people might be surprised to hear that Ryan Sohmer, creator of Least I Could Do, Gutters and Looking For Group, wanted to write a book about family and being a parent. The strange thing is, if you know him, you know just how important his family is to him. And if you've had kids, you know just how funny and odd some of these experiences can be. And if you are someone's kid, which is pretty likely, you probably broke something of your parents and owe them something, so you should get them this book.\nRyan, his wife and son, live in Montreal, Canada where they endure the winters and await the return of the animals in spring.\nIt was very important to him that the pictures express the same fun and sweet sentiment of what was written, and the work of Becky Dreistadt seemed a natural fit. Her soft but vibrant watercolor work and ability to subtly anthropomorphize animals won our hearts long ago and we were overjoyed to have her on this project. Becky's online comic, Tigerbuttah, is a series of paintings about the adventures of Tigerbuttah, a fun loving little Tiger. She's also started a fun side project called Capture Creatures.\nBecky and her man reside in sunny California. We understand the weather there is always nice and the animals never hibernate.\nSo why Kickstarter?\nTwo simple reasons\n1) While we have a successful publishing company, this is a new kind of book for us, so we want to hear from YOU on this before we jump in with both feet.\n2) Kickstarter let's us not only reach our current fans, but also to reach out to a whole other audience that will help us make this project a success.\nReward us and we'll reward you.\nAt this point in the game, we're ready to go! The art is done, the layout is finished and the cover and stock choices have been made. All we need now is to know how many books you guys want! We want to make 5,000 books and we think with your help that's a very achievable goal. And because it's only a matter of funding, with all the hard work done, we'd be able to get these books out the door and into your hands before the Holiday season this year, so you'd be able to give these as gifts to the mom's and dad's in your life.

Come and hide out with us! Get yourself to Montreal to spend a couple days with us. We'll come collect you from the airport, and pick you up each day from your hotel, all in our super-cool van. Then we'll waste the day at the office, shooting the staff with Nerf guns, bickering over lunch and generally causing havoc, pretty much like most days. And after a hard day of slacking and off-colour jokes, we'll head off to dinner and drinks. The next day, hangover or not, you're back to \"work\" in the office until it's time to get your ass back on a plane and return to your family.\nYou'll need to pick your two weekdays (no weekends) and we'll work around those. There are some fine details to work out, and our staff will co-ordinate with you to make sure it all works out perfectly. You'll of course have to look after your details like a passport, making sure the kids are looked after and that sort of thing.\nLeave a little room in your luggage, 'cause your gonna get loaded up with swag. Books and prints and a tattoo you'll regret forever!\nThe Hide The Silverware\nOh man, guess who's coming to diner! We'll pack up the man himself, Ryan Sohmer, and send him along with a bunch of swag to you and your family to spend a day and night with you. We suggest making him babysit the kids while you and your significant other go out for a night off. Or maybe you want to dress like a baby and have Sohmer change you.....that's cool I guess.\nThis is limited to Sohmer traveling anywhere in North America, unless you opt in for the extra $3000 and go with the \"International\" option.\nStretch Goals\nIn conclusion\nIf you want to know more about and see more of this project, you can check out the Facebook page to see more images and to read other fun tidbits as they occur.

I want to show you a region that has all of those problems and plenty more, but despite its wounds is climbing back up.\nI have lived, worked, and learned in Binghamton for the past few years, and have come to truly appreciate the area. Learning how to capture life and reality as I learned about my new environment really makes this an exciting project for me. The Greater Binghamton Area has influenced my craft and now I am using those skills to share the story of Binghamton with the rest of the world.\nHope is contagious, hope is inspirational, and in this economy everyone can use a little encouragement. Nothing improves without hope.\nHow?\nOver the course of the next year I will be interviewing experts in the fields of history, the environment, and economics to puzzle together the story of where the Greater Binghamton Area has been and how living quality of an area is the sum of both economic and environmental health. I will also be exploring what it will take for this area to once again become prosperous.\nThis documentary is not going to be your run-of-the-mill seventy five minutes of \"talking heads\" coupled with b-roll and edited together to tell you guys the story I want to get across.\nI have something much more challenging in mind for myself as a filmmaker, but also for you as a viewer. I would be lying if I said I won't have any \"talking heads\" but the bulk of my documentary is going to consist of real life. I will present you with three to five video portraits of people from different ages, races, creeds, and economic standing. Together, these portraits will mesh together into a mural.\nBetween each video portrait will be a sequence of \"experimental cinema\". I will be shooting these sequences on film and editing the film itself then sending it away to be digitized so I can use it in the documentary. In my opinion, something like a transition can be depicted much more accurately and effectively through experimental techniques than through dialogue.\n\nCost\nI have already emptied my bank account in order to buy my camera and some audio equipment, but there is so much more that I need to pay for, so here is an estimated break-down of my expenses (and I am budgeting for getting the best prices I can):\nBasic Gear (camera, lenses, Audio equipment): $5,000\nLighting equipment: $500 - $800\nGetting a website designed and paying for domain space: $2,000 - 3,000\nFestival submissions: $2,000\nOriginal music from very generous friends: $300\nMarketing: $400\nTaxis/Bus: $150\nTransferring Film to Digital (for transitions): $500\nPressing DVDs: 2,000\nMiscellaneous (small costs here and there that really add up): $1,000 - $2,000\nI have been told I won't be able to get through pre-production, production, and post production with any less than $20,000.

Coupled with a portable wireless keyboard, it makes an excellent impromptu workstation for email and text messaging.\nQ2: Will it fit in my wallet? How big is it?\n\nA2: The same size as 2 stacked embossed credit cards, or 3 non-embossed loyalty cards. Try it yourself to see the difference. The length is 1/4\u201d shorter than a standard credit card to account for the extra thickness so it fits in your wallet easier.\nDimensions:\nThickness: 0.090 inches or 2.29 mm. (less than 3/32 inches)\nLength: 2-7/8 inches or 73mm - 1/4\" less than standard credit card.\nWidth: 2-1/8 inches or 54 mm \u2013 Same as standard credit card\nQ3: Is my phone compatible with the ClearShot?\n\nA3: Most likely. It was designed for use with the iPhone 4/4S because that is what I use. The unique flexible design, however, allows it to work well with nearly any smart phone on the market, and with any case. It even works with oversized cases like the Mophie extended battery pack, and the Otterbox. The Samsung Galaxy will work but ONLY at a 45-degree angle in landscape orientation. \nQ4: Why not use a kickstand case?\nA4: The short answer: FREEDOM! I use a bumper and love it -- I don\u2019t want a bulky case. Plus, I am aware that people invest up to $50 for a case that they love. I am not interested in converting you, which is why I designed the ClearShot so it wouldn\u2019t discriminate against any case.\n\nNote: Range of motion is slightly limited for thicker phones and cases.\n\nQ5: What angles does the ClearShot support?\n\nA5: One great advantage to its design is that changing the angle is as simple as touching the phone to adjust the angle.\n\nLANDSCAPE: nearly infinite choices between -45 to +45 degrees\nPORTRAIT: 90 degrees OR 45 degrees only\nQ6: It's so thin! Does it actually provide good support?\nA6: Yes \u2013 by design, the ClearShot provides excellent stability for your phone at every angle. As you change the angle of the phone, the center of gravity remains near the center of the card base.\nQ7: Will the hinge crack or break after repeated use?\nA7: The ClearShot was designed with what are called \"living hinges\". When the correct material is used, and the hinge is designed properly, the hinge can last forever. A dental floss container is a perfect example of a good hinge design. You can fold it back and forth for days and it won't break.\n\nFor a scientific explanation on living hinge design, click HERE.\n\nQ8: Can I choose the color?\nA8: The first production run will be black matte, but I may offer color choices at the campaign close. Prototype embroidery offered in nearly any color thread, up to 2 colors each.\nA Little More Project Background\nAs a Boeing engineer, I am aware of the effort required to design in an impossibly small envelope. Designing something in half the space becomes four times more difficult. The current and final design represents a year and a half of endless trials, errors, and revisions.\nPrototyping & Design\nEarly prototypes were painstakingly carved from plastic sheets by hand with razors, drills, clamps, and literally hundreds of tools.\nThe design process is quite a process!\nI used to design them in Inkscape, print them on paper, and then cut through the paper on to the plastic. Easily over 100 design concepts and variations have preceded what is now a stable design. I can proudly say that I have made at least 20 prototypes since the last design revision.\nLet There Be LASER Light!\nThe days of hand cutting are long gone as I now use a laser to cut the pieces from a vector graphics file (with endless thanks to Matt Westervelt at Metrix Create Space in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood). The laser enables me to get perfect consistency, however each prototype is still extremely labor intensive, time consuming and tedious.\nPrototype Production - A Labor of Love\nThe process requires me to create the graphics file, export to the laser, run the laser, cut along laser path with a razor, trim edges, heat and bend hinges, and finally, hand stitch 5 individual parts together. Custom embroidery adds significant time since the hole pattern for each stitch is created individually. Each prototype requires about 2 hours of work.\nI am often asked why stitching is the preferred method. The reason is that there are no glues or adhesive tapes that will bond securely to the polypropylene (the required material for a durable living hinge) - it simply peels off. So the stitching you see in the photos are both functional and aesthetic. It has become a great way to make each prototype personal, and nearly indestructible.\nFor now, the hand stitching works -- everyone absolutely loves the personal touch that this adds. They are extremely high quality and accurate representations of the final product, but are not feasible to scale at the anticipated demand. Custom embroidery will only be offered for the duration of this campaign.\nScaling For Production\nI have been working with an injection mold company who has the ability to produce at a pace to meet demand. This will require very specialized tooling to create the injection mold. In addition, An ultrasonic welding process will be used to manually bond the sandwiched layers together. Ultrasonic welding is a process where the layers are squeezed together with pressure, and then energy is applied in the form of vibration at an extremely high frequency (about 20,000 hz). Small ridges called energy directors at the joint face melt from the heat due to friction, and the two parts become one. Each of these processes incurs its own cost, and the 20,000 goal is the absolute minimum amount to proceed.\nI have submitted the engineering drawings to the mold company, and they are just waiting for me to commit and sign the contract.\nExample Rewards\nHere I am posting photos of some previous prototypes and other rewards. Everything I am offering has been designed solely by myself. All prototypes, packaging, and key fobs will be laser cut, engraved, and hand assembled with extreme care and precision, and will be held to high quality standards. All rewards are guaranteed defect free. For any excessive demand, I am prepared with a small army in the local Seattle area to help with production of prototypes and fulfillment.\n\"The BIG DEAL\" Reward Package for our friends at \"Today's iPhone\", a great site for iPhone tips, news, and reviews.\nDisassembled \"BIG DEAL\" Reward Package\nKey Fob - laser cut and etched with white oil pen fill. Reverse side to be customized for all rewards $150+\nThe 4 pink line segments you see stitched here are the critical seams that will exist in all prototypes. All other stitching is mainly aesthetic, and will not be included for the basic prototype reward.\nThe iPhone in the portrait orientation at a 90 degree angle.

Simply move the phone and the ClearShot will hold at the desired angle to eliminate glare.\nAs an engineer and designer, I love gadgets. I love my iPhone, and I love photography. The combination of these passions has led me to invent the ClearShot. It is the world's most portable tripod for your iPhone or smart phone. It collapses to about the size of a credit card, so it fits in your wallet for easy on-the-go accessibility.\n\nPrimarily, we are a team of two. My name is Mike, and I am the product designer. I coordinate everything technical relating to the product. Kara is the creative director for all campaign material including the video.\n\nWe can do a lot, but we can't do it all. So, we have been building a strong support system of IP/legal, business, technical, and manufacturing professionals to make sure everything goes to plan.\nThank you so much for considering making a pledge to our project.

BusinessWeek! The Verge! Wired! IGN! The New York Times! Time!\nWe love console games.\nThere's something about a big HD TV and digital surround sound that fills up a living room. Shooters, platformers, sports games, arcade classics and experimental indie games just feel bigger on a TV screen. It's how most of us grew up gaming. \nBut maybe people are missing out.\nWe get it \u2013 smartphones and tablets are getting all the new titles \u2013 they're \"what's hot.\u201d The console market is pushing developers away. We\u2019ve seen a brain drain: some of the best, most creative gamemakers are focused on mobile and social games because those platforms are more developer-friendly. And the ones who remain focused on console games can\u2019t be as creative as they\u2019d like.\nDeep down, you know your best gaming memories happened in the living room.\nYou busted your ass just to find out the princess was \"in another castle.\" You fought bosses that told you repeatedly how much \"you suck.\" You taped a blanket to half of your screen so your friend couldn't see where you were. You traded the best players onto your team just so you could have the perfect season. And you did it all on the TV.\nIt's time to upend console gaming.\nLet\u2019s open this sucker up! It's time we brought back innovation, experimentation, and creativity to the big screen. Let\u2019s make the games less expensive to make, and less expensive to buy. With all our technological advancements, shouldn't costs be going down? Gaming could be cheaper!\nWe're handing the reins over to the developer with only one condition: at least some gameplay has to be free. We borrowed the free-to-play model from games like League of Legends, Team Fortress 2, Triple Town, and many others. Developers can offer a free demo with a full-game upgrade, in-game items or powers, or ask you to subscribe.\nOUYA: The revolution will be televised \nOUYA is a new game console for the TV, powered by Android.\nWe've packed this little box full of power. Developers will have access to OUYA's open design so they can produce their games for the living room, taking advantage of everything the TV has to offer. \nBest of all, OUYA's world-class controller, console, and interface come in one beautiful, inexpensive package. All the games on it will be free, at least to try.\nGreat games come from great developers.\nDevelopers can wave farewell to the roadblocks of bringing a console game to market. Anyone can make a game: every OUYA console is a dev kit. No need to purchase a license or an expensive SDK. It's built on Android, so developers already know how it works. \nThat doesn't mean OUYA is an Android port. You can create the next big title in your bedroom \u2013 just like the good old days! Who needs pants!? \nOUYA could change AAA game development, too. Forget about licensing fees, retail fees, and publishing fees. \nAnd developers agree:\n\"This has the potential to be the game developer\u2019s console. It's about time!\" -- Brian Fargo (founder of inXile) \n\u201cWho wouldn't want a beautiful piece of industrial design that sells for $99, plugs straight into your TV, and gives you access to a huge library of games?\" \u2013 Jordan Mechner (creator of Prince of Persia, Karateka) \n\u201cIf OUYA delivers on the promise of being the first true open gaming platform that gives indie developers access to the living room gaming market, yes that is a great idea. We will follow the development of OUYA and see how it resonates with gamers. I could see all current Mojang games go on the platform if there's a demand for it.\u201d \u2013 Mojang (developer of Minecraft) \n\"I'm excited for OUYA! I am a firm believer that there is always room to challenge the status quo.\" -- Jenova Chen (thatgamecompany, creator of flOw, Cloud, and Flower)\n\u201cThe prospect of an affordable, open console -- that's an idea I find really exciting.\u201d -- Adam Saltsman (Semi Secret, creator of Canabalt)\n\n\"Our games will work so well on a TV, we just need an easy way to get them there. OUYA could be it.\" -- Marek Rabas (Madfinger Games)\n\n\"An open game console that gives independent game developers the flexibility to experiment with their games and business models on the TV, is something that's long overdue.\" \u2013 David Edery (Spry Fox, creator of Triple Town)\nDesign matters.\nWe believe a great console requires a great user experience. We are working with the award-winning designer, Yves Behar, and his firm fuseproject (designer of the Jambox).\nWe are designing the controller to be a love letter to console gaming. It will have everything you've learned to love: fast buttons, triggers, laser-precise analog sticks, a D-Pad \u2013 and it will have a touchpad for any games making the trek from mobile or tablet to the TV. It'll be just the right weight. We are working with select developers to play-test the controller through development.  We call it 'the Stradivarius of controllers,' and we hope developers will be inspired to take gameplay to a new level with it.\nHackers welcome.\nHave at it: It's easy to root (and rooting won't void your warranty). Everything opens with standard screws. Hardware hackers can create their own peripherals, and connect via USB or Bluetooth. You want our hardware design? Let us know. We might just give it to you. Surprise us!\nSpecifications:\nTegra3 quad-core processor \n1GB RAM \n8GB of internal flash storage\nHDMI connection to the TV, with support for up to 1080p HD \nWiFi 802.11 b/g/n \nBluetooth LE 4.0 \nUSB 2.0 (one) \nWireless controller with standard controls (two analog sticks, d-pad, eight action buttons, a system button), a touchpad \nAndroid 4.0\nETHERNET! (Announced by Muffi 7/18)\nStandard OUYA Console\nLimited-Edition Kickstarter Console\nIt's entertainment beyond gaming. \nBecause OUYA is based on Android, any app developer could publish their Android app to OUYA. The possibilities are limitless, and conversations with potential partners are already underway. Here\u2019s our first: do you like watching StarCraft, or League of Legends? Watch Twitch.TV on your OUYA. \nWe've come a long way already. The user interface and industrial designs are far along. Our prototype is up and running. What we have left to do is simple, but it's expensive. (We\u2019re looking at you Mark Cuban! Woz! Help us out.)\nAll we need is you. \nWith your help, we need to: \nConvert our prototype to production-ready models and get all the regulatory approvals (yeah, we need these to sell them)\nDeliver developer kits (for early developers so we can have games on day one, though every console will include an SDK once we launch)\nPlace our first production orders (we are working with a manufacturing firm with lots of game hardware experience, but we need to know how many to make!)\nIdeally, fund some initial game development (i.e., 1st-party games)\nAnd if you\u2019re international, we want your help too\u2026gaming is global, and we will get you OUYA. We still have a lot to figure out in regards to rights and countries, but it can be done. Look what we've accomplished already! \nShow the world, through your numbers, that you're out there.\nShow them you're ready to level the playing field. Enlist others. The more we raise, the more we can do. \nOUYA: THE REVOLUTION WILL BE TELEVISED", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 29371, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ouya/ouya-a-new-kind-of-video-game-console", "project_name": "OUYA: A New Kind of Video Game Console"}}, {"backer": "Dan Chan", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Eyebeam is opening its space to you!\nUPDATE 12: Nato Thompson, Chief Curator at Creative Time, on the importance of Eyebeam's space for creative collaboration. \nUPDATE 13: 70 Hours to go!!

A simple, affordable and extremely easy to use device used for motion control and image capture for Time Lapse Photography + more. The Genie is an all-in-one device used to combine image capture with motion control, capable of either panning or linear movement that\u2019s commonly used in Time Lapse Photography. Simply attach your camera to the top of the Genie, plug it in, and program it to move and shoot to your desired needs. \nThe Panning and Linear accessories provide ultimate flexibility for a range of movement and it\u2019s transportable size means you will never have to go without the option of motion controlled Time Lapses no matter how constrained your location may be. Visit our website www.syrp.co.nz.\n \nFeatures.\nPanning or Linear Mode.  The Genie can be setup to record either panning or linear time lapses.  Attached to any standard tripod head or legs the Genie connects to your camera and is programmed to move and shoot in a panning direction at your desired speed.  To switch between modes simply detach the panning accessory and attach the linear accessory.  This is commonly used with sliders or dollies so the Genie can now drive in a linear direction along a track to capture perfectly smooth tracking time lapses.\n\nCompatibility.  One of the coolest things about the Genie is that it is able to integrate with all of your existing equipment - whether you have a professional slider or your homemade DIY track, simply screw the Genie on and attach the rope to either end using the supplied accessory.  Since the Genie uses standard rope in linear mode, the only limit to the length of your camera move is how long your length of rope is.  This opens up a huge amount of creativity including using the device with a cable cam or on a skateboard.  How about that office chair you're sitting on right now?! The options are endless - Rig it up over a football field, between buildings or over a lake.  Since you are no longer limited by the length of your slider you have more control over the creativity of your shot.\nThe Genie on a Phillip Bloom Pocket Dolly.\nThe Genie Connected on a Glide Track Slider.\nThe Genie on a DIY Cable Cam Driven 60 Feet over a lake.\nThe Genie attached to a skateboard.\nUsing rope the Genie Drives along the length of a tennis court.\nThe Genie on a gorilla pod capable of panning up or down with a 5D Mark 2.\nSupplied rope accessories attached on a Phillip Bloom Slider\nUser Presets. A lot of time has been spent refining the Software on the Genie to make it extremely easy to use.  Being able to save presets into the recording menu is one of the key features.  This means that if you are happy with your final time lapse then you can simply save your settings into the recording menu so that you can easily revert back to them at another location.  The time between setting up your shot and pressing 'Start' is drastically reduced resulting in an increased possibility that you will get the shot you're after.\nPreview Mode. Preview mode allows you to watch your time lapse movement before starting your camera move.  Once you have your time lapse settings refined you can simply press preview and the genie will drive at the 'real time' speed of your final time lapse movement.  This means you can refine exactly how fast or slow your final speed of movement will be, once again increasing the chance of getting your desired shot.  In this mode it is also possible to record perfectly smooth real time video shots such as panning or slider shots. (Note that there are some limitations to how fast the Genie can drive).\nPortability. Our research and experience with Motion Control equipment indicates that often film makers will put it in the 'too hard basket'. We believe much of this reasoning comes about due to bulky and heavy equipment.  It's easy to rule out the option of taking your motion control kit along with the rest of your camera gear particularly in constraining environments such as in the wilderness or around cities.  With the Genie all components are packaged into one neat device with integrated screen, keypad, motor, batteries and controller all inside one unit.  This allows you to always have the option of Motion Control time lapse whether you need it or not; as it easily fits alongside your camera in a standard camera bag.\nSensors. The Genie has an interface port that allows users to connect a variety of sensors including light, motion and sound sensors that will trigger the genie to start a recording, take a photo or take multiple photos. \nThis application will be primarily valuable for Natural History and Nature Documentaries where capturing animals in remote locations is difficult. The sensor port also allows for integration with smart phones providing additional functionality via updateable external mobile Apps.\nSmartphone App. Currently a mobile App for android and Iphones is in development.  This will allow full control of the Genie and the various settings from your smartphone.\nFor blogs, updates and more information visit:\nWebsite: www.syrp.co.nz\nFollow us on Facebook, twitter or instagram username: syrp_\nThank you for your support!\n\nWe also want to thanks some great people that have helped out along the way and who we couldn't done with out!\nAidan Fraser - Software Engineering\nGrant Mark - Software Advice\nAshley Marsh-Croft - Website & Design reviews\nLuther Keats - Electronics Engineering\nMarc Palmano- Electronics Engineering\nHeath Patterson - Filming / Testing\nTom Lynch - Music\nSteve - Sound Mix\nColin West\nMums & Dads - Years of food for the body and the mind\nAll our friends -  Helping us out along the way, cheap rent, free food, great convos, and an enormous amount of support and encouragement!

My career as an author of science and historical fiction has turned me into a swordsmanship geek. As such, I'm dissatisfied with how swordfighting is portrayed in existing video games. These could be so much more fun than they are. Time for a revolution.\nIn the last couple of years, affordable new gear has come on the market that makes it possible to move, and control a swordfighter's actions, in a much more intuitive way than pulling a plastic trigger or pounding a key on a keyboard. So it's time to step back, dump the tired conventions that have grown up around trigger-based sword games, and build something that will enable players to inhabit the mind, body, and world of a real swordfighter.\nCLANG will begin with the Queen of Weapons: the two-handed longsword used in Europe during late medieval and early renaissance times. This is a well-documented style that has enjoyed a revival in recent years thanks to the efforts of scholars and martial artists worldwide.\nAt first, it'll be a PC arena game based on one-on-one multiplayer dueling (which is a relatively simple and attainable goal; we don't want to mess this up by overreaching). Dueling, however, is only the tip of the sword blade. During the past few years, we have been developing a rich world, brimming with all manner of adventure tales waiting to be written--and to be played. In conjunction with 47 North, Amazon.com's new science fiction publishing house, we've already begun publishing some of those stories, and we have plenty more in the hopper. Once we get CLANG off the ground we intend to weave game and story content together in a way that'll enhance both the playing and the reading experience.\n\"How will this be different than SoulCalibur?\" you ask. .....\nLow-latency, high-precision motion controller: Critical to a satisfying sword fight is fast, accurate response. This is especially important for CLANG given the depth and complexity of moves that are used in real sword arts. Initially, CLANG will make use of a commercial, third-party, off-the-shelf controller that anyone can buy today\nDepth: Roundhouse swings and crude blocks just aren't enough. Real sword fighting involves multiple attacks delivered from different stances, pommel strikes, grappling, feints, and parries.\nExpandability: Implementing the longsword style will oblige us to construct a toolkit that can then be used--by us, or by others--to create other examples of what we're calling MASEs (Martial Arts System Embodiments). If your thing is Japanese kenjutsu or Viking sword-and-board, then in principle CLANG should support it.\nRaising an army (or, in this case, building an enormous story-driven video game) is an expensive proposition and can take a number of years. In keeping with the scrappy, ragtag band of adventurers model, we are building this larger vision one step at a time. The next step is to build a functional proof of concept in the form of an exciting prototype we can share with you and use to achieve our next level of funding--which will enable us to provide more character models, more environments, and more MASEs. Which is to say, other weapons and styles from other places and eras. We are building a framework that can be expanded as far and as deeply as possible. We have, after all, several thousand years of martial history to draw from.              \nIn Which Neal goes into detail, as is his wont, regarding Clang:\nPlease read Technical Update #1 for details on CLANG design elements such as MASEs and In/Out of System movements.\nTechnical Update #2 covers our plans for the combat UI.\nIn Technical Update #3 Neal discusses timing, lag and tachypsychia.\nTechnical Update #4 goes more deeply into Sword Sync and Force Feedback.\nVideo update for reaching 50% of our goal.

(We know that's a bold claim, but we really believe it's true.) \nWe've been working on Howler for months, and issue one is nearly ready to be printed, shipped, and in your hands by late summer.\nExperienced editors and designers\nMark Kirby and George Quraishi (that's me) are former editors at GQ, Cond\u00e9 Nast Portfolio, National Geographic Adventure, and HarperCollins Publishers. Our partners are Robert Priest and Grace Lee, designers who have invented or completely redefined the looks of publications such as Esquire, GQ, Cond\u00e9 Nast Portfolio, House & Garden, Bloomberg Markets, and Reuters.\nWe're all soccer fans\u2014well, Grace is still getting the hang of it\u2014and Howler will be the first magazine that any of us have made just for fun: to our own standards, on our own time, and about a subject that we truly love.\nTalented contributors\nFor months, Mark and I have been busy assigning stories to a roster of excellent sports and literary writers. Some of them cover soccer in newspapers, books, and blogs. A handful of their names may be familiar: Frank Foer. Aleksandar Hemon. David Hirshey. George Vecsey. David Wangerin. Jonathan Wilson. Over the years, we've met lots of other excellent writers, people who obsess about soccer but make their living covering other things for outlets such as the New York Times, the New Yorker, Fortune, Fast Company, Food & Wine, the New Republic, Time, Business Week, the Guardian, and the Paris Review. \nWe're excited to bring their voices to a subject as rich as soccer. Same goes for the vision of our artists.\nRobert and Grace have been working with the illustrators and photographers in their network to make these stories beautiful\u2014people like Brian Rea, Alvaro Tapia Hidalgo, Jeffrey Smith, Ryu Voelkel, andEmmanuel Polanco. The result is a magazine that looks unlike anything our readers have come to expect from traditional soccer publications.\nAn illustration by Alvaro Tapia Hidalgo for Howler.\nStuff that matters to us\n1. Howler will be in print, not just online\nOur contributors put a lot of time into the stories and art they create for Howler. A print magazine, especially one as large as 10x12 inches, is still the best way to appreciate their work and display it on your coffee table.\n2. We will cover both domestic and international soccer\nSoccer is just like music and food: better understood in a larger, international context. We're creating Howler for a predominantly North American audience\u2014fans that have a variety of perspectives on the game and deserve a publication tailored to their interests. If it's a good story, you will read about it here.\n3. Serious journalism is important, but so is having a sense of humor\nWe named our magazine after a mistake\u2014in England, a howler is a blunder, a schoolboy error\u2014because we admire the sense of humor you find in English commentary on the sport. So we can explore the ways that soccer helps us understand social problems, ethnic tension, big business, youth culture, etc\u2014and we can poke fun at ourselves for being people who say stuff like that.\n4.  We will not compromise on quality\nDoing this the right way is very expensive. The money we raise on Kickstarter will allow us to pay contributors, the printing press, and shipping costs.\nWhy Kickstarter\nWe're looking to Kickstarter to help us get off the ground. Howler's contributors have worked with us at below market rates because they believe in the idea. Now we need readers who, like our contributors, believe in our idea and are prepared to support it by purchasing a subscription.\nThe prices we have set for single issues and subscriptions are competitive with other premium quarterly publications, and we hope that people who appreciate quality writing and artwork will agree that it's worth paying for.\nA final word\nWhen Americans don't get soccer, it's because they don't get the simple idea that soccer is about stories. Every game\u2014every season\u2014is a story. We want to make Howler because we want to tell stories about soccer. And we want you to support Howler because it will mean that, four times a year, we'll get to send you those stories in a beautiful and intelligent collection. That's a simple idea too. We hope you'll dig it.\nThank you,\nThe Howler Team\nPS: On Twitter we are @whatahowler.\nThe Wayne Rooney paper doll.\nInternational shipping: if you live outside the US or Canada, please add $5 for a single issue; $10 for a single issue and a shirt; and $20 for a subscription and everything above that level.\nImages used in our video come from Flickr users miguelangelnunez, Oh Barcelona, and flawka.

Past speakers at The Feast include Matthew Bishop of The Economist, Perry Chen, Founder of Kickstarter, Tom Szaky, Co-founder of Terracycle, Naveen Selvadurai, Co-founder of Foursquare, Scott Belsky, CEO of Behance and more. \n\nOver those four years, the landscape for Social Innovation has changed and so has our role. For 2012, in addition to rethinking our annual conference, we\u2019re opening up the dialogue to move people to action like never before. We want to host The World\u2019s Fare: a huge, global, roaming dinner party capped off with a public celebration of innovation in New York City, all to change the world.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works. \nWe\u2019re inviting innovators and instigators everywhere, doers and entrepreneurs of all ages to host a literal Feast of their own for six or more friends at 7pm local time on October 5, 2012. (That\u2019s the final day of The Feast Conference.)\nThe goal is simple: break bread and by the end of dinner, collectively decide on one thing you all can collaborate on to improve the world (whether it\u2019s renovating the park or supporting an effort to redefine an industry!) \nAs these dinners take place across the globe and conference attendees workshop throughout that day, we\u2019ll collect all of the ideas that emerge on a dedicated website.\nNow here\u2019s the kicker. Akin to the original World\u2019s Fair, we want to then host a giant public pavilion in NYC the very next day (October 6) to cap off this roaming dinner. Kids, families, and anyone from the creative community will be able to explore your ideas, enjoy food, music, performance, and get inspired by some of today\u2019s most amazing innovations.\nMore info available at feastongood.com/worldsfare\nWhy are we doing this? \nBecause we believe that a better future is possible, but it doesn\u2019t come from the top down. It\u2019s built by the actions of people like you who re-imagine how something might be better and seize the opportunity to make that the reality.\nWhy turn to Kickstarter?\nWe need your help to make the World\u2019s Fare happen, so we\u2019re turning to Kickstarter for two main reasons:\n\n1) To help raise funds so we can coordinate this global Feast. \nWe\u2019re looking to develop a dedicated site with an interactive map of registered Feasts, a searchable database of ideas that will be coming out of these events, and a resource toolkit for dinner hosts. A portion of the funds from this campaign will help us work with a talented web design/development team as well as some great content partners that we\u2019re already engaged with to make this platform a reality.\n\n2) To help raise funds so we can construct the public pavilion. \nOur plan is to completely transform a raw space in NYC into an epic showcase of the most remarkable innovations. The centerpiece will be an interactive, live art piece that displays all of the ideas and efforts coming in from those \u201cFeasting\u201d around the world.  A portion of the funds from this campaign will help us work with our fabulous architectural and event production partners so we can move forward with the next phase of design for the space and the installations within it. \nBack the project, help make this happen.\nOfficial registration to host a dinner will open to the public, free of charge, later in the summer. \n\nBut to make this all happen, we need to raise a certain amount of money to cover the next steps. With this Kickstarter campaign, we hope to raise those funds through the folks that believe in this vision  and want to help make it possible. \nAfter the Kickstarter, backers of this campaign will have the option to pre-register as our founding dinner hosts (before official registration later this Summer) and will be recognized as special \u201cFriends of the Fare\u201d (with various levels) for their contribution.\nWhether it\u2019s an initiative big or small, a new project, an old one, or that idea you just keep putting off, these dinners are the opportunity to host a kickoff (or even launch party!) for getting it off the ground. (See the FAQ for project examples.)\n\nWe also fully encourage you to back the project if you\u2019re not looking to host a dinner of your own. You can definitely still support the dinner party and the construction of the public pavilion of innovation. You can attend The Feast events we\u2019re cooking up in New York City and scoop up some great rewards including T-shirts, Tattlys, Totes, some exciting dinner opportunities, and tickets to the pavilion, Feast afterparty and even the 2012 Feast Conference. \nIf you can\u2019t decide whether or not to host a dinner, don\u2019t fret friend. Dinner registration happens after the campaign anyways, so you can pledge for one of these rewards now and decide later!\nWhat has been done so far?\nWe\u2019ve been in the planning process for many months. With reference to the World\u2019s Fare dinners, we\u2019ve started establishing larger hubs through partner hosts in New Zealand, Germany, Italy, and beyond. We\u2019re also putting our theme, \u201cThe Power of Community,\u201d to work by partnering with organizations that truly combine community and action to make this the largest dinner party ever.\n\nWe\u2019ve laid out our requirements and information architecture for the website and engaged a great web design/development shop. We\u2019re lucky to also be working with some amazing process design partners on creating what we believe will be a hugely useful and valuable toolkit for our dinner hosts.\nBy collaborating with the city of New York we\u2019ve secured an inspiring 10,000 sq. ft. raw warehouse space, which will be the site of our large public event. In addition, we\u2019ve begun curating some of the remarkable exhibitors/vendors for the pavilion. And we\u2019ve also been working extensively with amazing design partners including the guys from Family and Playlab, masterminds behind the + Pool, to plan the build out of this pavilion of innovation.\nIn other exciting news, we\u2019re partnering with the American Museum of Natural History and Eyebeam Art and Technology Center to host this year\u2019s Feast Conference.\n\nThe Bigger Picture: The Feast Social Innovation Week \nDuring the first week of October this year, The Feast plans to host the first ever Social Innovation Week: a global series of events, centered in New York City, focused on building a brighter future from the bottom up.\n\nThe Feast Conference and the World\u2019s Fare dinners and Pavilion serve as the major parts of the 2012 Social Innovation Week.

Please read Update #5 (in the Updates tab) for more details.\nUpdate: We're worked it out with Microsoft so that all of the Rewards will also apply to the Xbox 360 version of the table!\nHere at FarSight Studios we\u2019ve been developing console videogames for over 20 years. For the last seven years we\u2019ve been developing modern videogame recreations of classic pinball tables. We have licenses from the original manufacturers of the tables (Bally, Gottlieb, Stern, and Williams) to do this. Our latest project is called the Pinball Arcade and is currently available on a wide variety of platforms: the iPhone, iPad, Android phones and tables, the Kindle Fire, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PS Vita, and Macintosh, with versions coming soon for the PC, Nintendo 3DS, and Nintendo Wii U.  Check us out at www.pinballarcade.com. \nHere\u2019s what the gaming press has to say about the Pinball Arcade:\n\u201cFarSight Studios has been making digital pinball for nearly a decade, and Pinball Arcade is the culmination of that effort and experience\u2026 a must-own\u201d -IGN\n\u201cSimply one of the best pinball games I\u2019ve ever played\u201d \u2013Touch Arcade\n\u201can impressive title, and one that is bound to please pinball fans\u201d -148 Apps\n\u201cAs close to the pinball experience as you will ever get in the palm of your hand\u201d \u2013Pocket Gamer\n\u201cThis game is superb along with great presentation\u201d \u2013Inentertainment\n\u201cAuthenticity is the name of the game here, and Farsight has absolutely nailed it\u201d \u2013GameLive.TV\n\u201cPinball doesn\u2019t get any more real or fun on mobile\u201d \u2013Gamezebo\n\u201cpresentation of these tables is immaculate\u201d \u2013App Spy\nThe process of digitizing these tables is very complex. We first acquire the actual physical pinball table we want to digitize. We want our videogame version to play exactly the same as the table played when it was new, so we start with a thorough restoration of the table.  We then strip the table down to the bare wood playfield and take high-resolution digital photographs of every part. We use these to create three-dimensional computer models of each of the components on the playfield. When the modeling is complete we export the data into our graphics engine, which displays the table on each of our target platforms.\nNext we implement the table logic and sound. We do this by emulating the electronics in the original pinball table. Most complex tables were controlled by what are by modern standards primitive computers. We\u2019ve created ROM-emulation technology that allows the same program which controlled the original table to run on our target devices. This means that every rule, sound effect, and light sequence is exactly correct in our digital version. The idea that you can run the original code that controlled a huge cabinet-based pinball machine on your iPhone is pretty cool!\nThe last step in digitizing a table involves tuning the pinball physics. We\u2019ve continuously improved our pinball physics engine for the last seven years and we\u2019re very proud of it. We can individually control reflection angles and physics parameters for every section of any component on the playfield. We use the original table as reference when doing this to ensure accuracy. Finally the table goes through a review process where it\u2019s critiqued by pinball experts and approved by the table manufacturer. The end result of this painstaking process is an exact digital recreation of the pinball table that you can play on your handheld device or in your living room.\nWhat we\u2019re most proud of is that we\u2019re preserving these tables for future generations to enjoy. We can remember when these tables were in every pizza parlor and bowling alley, but they are becoming increasingly rare. If you find one chances are it\u2019s not been well treated and many features are burned out or broken. If you\u2019re a pinball fanatic like us you can buy one and restore it, but they are expensive, maintenance-intensive, and there are fewer of them every year. Chances are very good that our children will never get the opportunity to appreciate these great tables in person- but by digitally preserving them they can!\nSome of the greatest pinball tables were based on licensed properties. Often when a manufacturer created a special new table they\u2019d base it on a popular cultural feature of the times: a movie perhaps, or a band or television show. Their original license to use these properties have long since expired, so when we want to create digital versions of these tables we must research who now owns the rights and negotiate with them. Sometimes the discussions are easy and sometimes they are very difficult. In addition if the table features actors on the backglass or playfield we must secure licenses to use their likenesses (sometimes from their estates if they are deceased). Some table also featured popular music of the times that we must secure composition and performance licenses to. It can be a daunting task!\nOne of the licensed tables that we\u2019ve always wanted to digitize is the Twilight Zone. This table was released by Midway under the Bally label and is unquestionably one of the greatest pinball tables of all time (in fact it\u2019s currently #1 in user rankings on the Internet Pinball Database!) It was designed by the legendary Pat Lawlor (who also designed Whirldwind, The Addams Family, Safecracker, and No Good Gofers). After the commercial and critical success of The Addams Family table, Midway gave Pat complete create freedom with the Twilight Zone, and what resulted was a showpiece of innovative pinball design. The Twilight Zone is considered by many pinball experts to be the most complex pinball machine ever created. It\u2019s a masterpiece!\nWe\u2019ve finally succeeded in negotiating all of the licenses we\u2019d need to digitize the Twilight Zone table and bring it to the Pinball Arcade. Unfortunately when we add up the costs of each required license and calculate what we\u2019d have to charge for the table, we\u2019ve realized that the Twilight Zone is just not commercially viable.\nHere\u2019s where you come in! The licenses will cost a daunting $55,000 (and that\u2019s just for the licenses- we\u2019ll cover all of the development expenses ourselves). If we can raise enough money through Kickstarter to cover the cost of the licenses, we\u2019ll be able to digitize the Twilight Zone and preserve one of the greatest pinball tables of all time. If we don't reach our goal no credit cards will be charged, but if we raise more then the goal we\u2019ll be able to digitize other licensed tables as well (like Star Trek: The Next Generation!) We\u2019ve put together a tempting list of rewards to say \u201cthank you\u201d for helping out.

Only having to upgrade one. \nThe $50 thin client\nWith your help, we can make this possible.  We can get the cost for each additional user down to a $50 thin client, to which each additional display, keyboard, and mouse is connected.  \nJust plug in several of these to the USB ports of a computer running special software (Fedora 17 Linux is the focus of this KickStarter project), and turn your one PC into a plug-and-play multiseat platform.  Every person sharing the computer has access to lots of free software, including familiar Firefox or Chrome browsers -- unless you're a power user, you don't need to care that Linux is underneath.\nThis is all 100% open source software, so there are no license costs whatsoever. $50 per user is it. \nThe cost and maintenance savings is obviously a big win for schools and organizations.\nBut it can also be useful in the home.  Have 3 of these in the house, and want to add a 4th for Aunt Velma who\u2019s visiting next month?  Plug in one of these $50 multiseat thin clients and a spare display, and up pops a fresh login screen, ready for Velma to use. No new computer to buy, configure, or maintain.\nBut we need your backing to reach these economies of scale for a $50 thin client.\nHow it works\nModern PCs have power to spare.  Your CPU is idling most of the time, between bursts of activity. And your PC has enormous untapped expandability.  Via USB, you can add up to 127 additional devices to your PC, including USB hubs, graphics adapters, keyboards, and mice.  Your PC is more capable than a dozen decade-old PCs.\nIt\u2019s possible to detect that a particular USB display, keyboard, and mouse are all connected through a common hub.  This is what\u2019s inside each Plugable Multiseat Thin Client. And with special operating system software, it\u2019s possible to pop up a fresh login screen when it detects a new client has arrived via USB. Because modern operating systems are multi-user, it can look and act like a completely separate machine with complete separation between all the simultaneous users.  It turns one PC into many.\nIt\u2019s not just cost savings\nEach Plugable Multiseat Thin Client consumes as little as 2.5 Watts (500mA @ 5V).  That\u2019s about 1/20th the power consumption of a typical laptop.  Or about 1/50th the power consumption of a typical desktop.\nEach thin client has no fan, no moving parts, nothing to replace.  To upgrade performance, you upgrade the one central PC, and keep the same clients.  No landfill.\nSo while you\u2019re saving money, you\u2019re saving the environment.\nAnd keeping computers running is a pain.  We collectively spend a lot of time dealing with software installs, data backups, automatic upgrades, etc.  In a classroom environment, keeping machines running cleanly requires constant vigilance.  If a PC goes down, lots of work goes down with it.\nWith a multiseat setup, you can divide that work by 5 or 10.  And if a thin client goes down, just swap it out \u2013 any user can log in at any one.\nWhy your Kickstarter backing is critical\nBut we need your help to make this happen.\nTo hit the $50 price point, we need to produce lots of units to get the price down\nThe open source software is close, but we need your support to push it over the finish line\nTo get computers in the hands of the next billion people on this planet, we need to make this work\nThe rewards - Two choices\nOur main focus is on pushing the \"small\" platform to reach the $50 price point. But for a little more, we also have the option of a powered thin client that can handle more than just USB keyboard and mouse.  Here's a little more detail on the two options covered in the rewards.\nThese thin clients are in production and sold today (although the DC-125 is updated for this Kickstarter project). But the cost to Kickstarters, even for one unit, will be lower than our available price elsewhere.\nDon\u2019t want Linux?\nWe understand, and so does Microsoft :).  While the focus of this Kickstarter project is on the work to get a 100% open source Linux project up and running based on Fedora 17, Windows has lots of big benefits.\nEvery Plugable Multiseat Thin Client purchased as part of this Kickstarter project also works on Windows Multipoint Server 2011, Microsoft\u2019s multiseat OS. Your investment in this hardware isn\u2019t tied to Linux. \nDelivering the Goods\nPlugable Technologies is a small startup (there's just 4 of us here!), but we already ship thousands of USB devices worldwide each month.  See http://plugable.com/shop and http://plugable.com/shop/eu to get a picture of what we do, and what customers think about our devices, service, and reliability.\nOn the hardware side, both the DC-125 and UD-160 platforms have been shipping for some time.  Complete re-engeineering isn't needed for this KickStarter project, fortunately.\nOn the software side, we develop the main low-level Linux open source driver (udlfb, the USB graphics driver), but there is lots of work above this level.  That said, we are already running thin client setups running with Fedora 17 Beta, and we believe we can recover from problems with an installable package to deliver any missing pieces or fix any blocking issues.\nIn terms of shipping, the biggest difficulty is reaching our backers outside the USA.  To make sure we can deliver, we're focusing on the shipping sweet spot of 5 unit bundles -- these fit perfectly in a USPS Large Flat rate box, and this is the single reward we can offer with confidence to buyers around the world.\nMore Questions?\nLet us know with an email to kickstarter@plugable.com.  We'll keep a FAQ so your questions can also help others. Thank you!\nMore Background \nThe ability to plug in a compound USB device with ASICs for hub, graphics, audio, and more, have all of its sub-devices supported with open source drivers in Linux, and have it be recognized and automatically used as a plug-and-play muliseat thin client .... phew! ... there's a huge amount going on to make something like this as easy as plug and play. And it's taken more than a decade of work by many, many people.  Just to call out two:\nDr. Quentin Stafford Fraser was one of the first to articulate and act on this vision for low-cost computing.  Along with Martin King (who passed away last year), he founded both DisplayLink and Ndiyo.org to progress this vision.\nLennart Poettering, through his systemd work at RedHat on Fedora, has made USB multiseat possible again, and this time with a clean, supportable architecture that is the basis of this Kickstarter project, and hopefully the basis of this support spreading to all the other Linux distros.\nOur work has focused on the udlfb kernel driver and on prototyping earlier multiseat implementations on Linux (that are now superceeded by Lennart's work).  You can read more at http://plugable.com/category/project/udlfb/ and see our source contributions to date at http://git.plugable.com/\nHistory \nYou can get even more background on the history and technology of USB multiseat in my 2009 Linux Plumbers Conference talk, below.  \nThis Kickstarter project is the culmination of a lot of work by many people, now including you too.

It will explore a single aspect of the culture of soccer in eleven eclectic and thoughtful ways in each issue. Long-form journalism, essays, interviews, fiction, poetry, translations, diaries, photography, graphic arts and other forms will help tell the unique story of soccer in North America.\nAs soccer continues to evolve in North America, XI aims to discuss in-depth the game\u2019s diversity and cultural reach through issues themed to topics such as immigration, women\u2019s soccer, playing space, supporter culture, business and media.\nXI grows out of the Internet-assisted soccer boom of the past two decades. The explosion of niche websites devoted to soccer of all kinds shows that mainstream media has not been able to keep up with the appetite for intelligent discussion among the game\u2019s broad range of followers in the US, Canada and Mexico.\nNorth American soccer is unlike soccer anywhere else. XI wants to tell this story by moving beyond short blog posts, through giving the time and space for insightful, original writing by people who see soccer not just as a sport but as part of society.\nDauer Packers, 1931. Credit: Collection of Les Jones - Covershots Inc., covershots@ca.inter.net.\nWhy XI?\n\u201cEleven is the most famous number in modern sports.\u201d (Erik Eggers)\nIn soccer that each team has 11 players is universal truth, as natural as a pair of eyeglasses having two lenses or a car four wheels. The number 11 expresses soccer\u2019s essence as collaboration; around the world, supporters refer to their national teams or favorite club sides as \u201cThe Eleven.\u201d\nEach issue of XI will be a collaboration. One editor will select his or her ideal \u201cside,\u201d including eleven samplings on the topic. Like the team huddled for the ritual pre-match photograph, each issue features eleven elements, working in concert to speak to a theme unique to soccer in North America.\nIssue One: \u201cComing to America\u201d\n\u201cIt takes a leaven of good Scotch, English, and Scandinavian players to make soccer a success. It looks tame to boys after American football and baseball.\u201d (The New York Times, May 23, 1915)\nFor most of its history in the US and Canada, organizers and followers have argued over what the sport should be called. Is it soccer or football? Or is it soccer football? Or, is it f\u00fatbol?\nThe questions focus on the still-lingering concept of North American soccer as import. It is appropriate that the first issue of XI, to be published summer 2012, focuses on soccer and immigration. The notion of soccer as an \u201cimmigrant game\u201d has defined its development in North America.\nFor some the fact that soccer has origins in non-American soil is a permanent taint.\nThe eternal question \u201cWhy isn\u2019t soccer as popular in North America as it is everywhere else?\u201d is often answered with reference, subtly or directly, to soccer\u2019s connections with immigrants.\nFor the editors of XI the strong links between immigration and North American soccer make the sport even more compelling. Issue one of XI explores the history of soccer as a \u201cforeign\u201d game and also samples North American soccer\u2019s extraordinary diversity. Deep connections in unseen or ignored communities have lent soccer vitality and staying power.\nFuture issues of XI\nIn 2012 and into 2013 XI plans issues on fan culture in North America, on women\u2019s soccer, on the business of North American soccer and on North American soccer\u2019s relationship to Latin America.\nRewards\nSure, you're not backing this project for the rewards.

It will be a new kind of public space, using solar technology for natural illumination, and cutting edge design to capture and highlight a very special industrial space.\nA park\u2026 underground?!?Ever wonder why there's so little green space in New York?  There aren\u2019t a lot of empty plots of land just waiting to be turned into new parks. New Yorkers have had to be a little more creative, and must look in unusual places \u2013 the High Line, a park built on an old elevated rail trestle, is a great example. \nA few years ago, we learned about a massive unused former trolley terminal in our neighborhood, the Lower East Side. We got to thinking: what if we could build a park-- underground-- even if the space lacked natural sunlight?  So we explored using fiber optic cables to transfer sunlight below ground-- to support the growth of plants and trees.  As we shared this idea with others, people got excited.  \"An underground High Line for the Lower East Side,\" they'd say.  \"Kind of like... a LowLine.\"  The nickname stuck. \nWhat is the space like?This \"Delancey Underground\" space is quite large, by New York standards: 60,000 square feet, or 1.5 acres -- nearly the size of Gramercy Park.  It was built in 1903 as a trolley terminal, for streetcars traveling over the Williamsburg Bridge, and has been out of operation since 1948.  We fell in love with the site because of its architectural details: old cobblestones, crisscrossing rail tracks, vaulted 20-foot ceilings, and strong steel columns.\nHere's what's even more exciting: it's in the heart of the Lower East Side.  Our neighborhood is one of the oldest in the U.S., and has been home to generations of immigrants for centuries.  It is a center of diversity, culture, creativity, and innovation.  \nLet the Sun Shine... UndergroundTo build this park, we're planning to use a cutting-edge version of existing technology-- which we've already built in prototype. The system uses a system of optics to gather sunlight, concentrate it, and reflect it below ground, where it is dispersed by a solar distributor dish embedded in the ceiling.  The light irrigated underground will carry the necessary wavelengths to support photosynthesis-- meaning we can grow plants, trees, and grasses underground. The cables block harmful UV rays that cause sunburn, so you can leave the SPF-45 at home. Sunglasses optional (for cool kids).\nWhat kind of a park is underground?  An awesome one. \nWe think a year-round public space will be valuable for everyone.  Farmers markets and vendor stands can feature fresh produce and locally made goods, supporting local and sustainable businesses.  Art installations, concerts, and performances can help showcase the incredible creative spirit of the Lower East Side.  Youth programming and educational opportunities can offer rich experiences for kids and parents.  And a safe haven from the hectic feel of Delancey Street will serve as relief in a very car-centric corner of Manhattan.\nWhen it's really cold, or pouring rain, how much fun is it to hang out in Central Park?  The High Line?  Not so much.  The LowLine can be the 21st century answer to traditional parks: instead of building up, let's build down! \nWhat we've done so farWe first presented this idea to our local community board in September, and have been overwhelmed with public interest ever since. We got some great press, from CNN to the New York Times to the Huffington Post. \nWe\u2019ve spoken with the MTA \u2013 the State-run Metropolitan Transit Authority, which owns the site \u2013 about this idea. The MTA was receptive; they are eager to turn the space into something new. But it\u2019s now our job to prove that the idea could work and would be popular.\nWe\u2019ve met with neighborhood business groups, who are excited about a new magnet for the Lower East Side. We\u2019ve talked with elected officials and community representatives about how we can gain access to the site and start building a park.\nWe\u2019ve spent the last year refining the solar technology, building an initial prototype to demonstrate how it works and planning for a large-scale demo later this year.  \nWe've also teamed up with HR&A -- the firm that originally helped demonstrate the potential positive impact of the High Line -- and are working closely with them to refine our analysis and economic model for the park.\nWhat we need to do nextNow we need to build a full-scale installation-- a \"mini LowLine\"-- so people can see this with their own eyes.  And we need $100,000 to build it.  This tech demo will be an invaluable tool in helping convince our community, potential funders, the City, and the MTA that this idea can work. It will also help us refine the technology so we get it perfect once it\u2019s time to build the real thing. We\u2019re planning on installing the mockup in the Essex Street Market, an indoor public space in our neighborhood.\nIn addition to raising this money, we\u2019re also beginning the feasibility study that will help build the economic case for the park, and will put us on even better footing with the MTA, the City, and our neighbors. We\u2019re also busy doing outreach to business owners and residents to find out what our neighbors would like to see in this new space.\nWe hope you\u2019ll support our effort to build a new kind of park. You can visit our web site, delanceyunderground.org (thelowline.org also works-- just don't forget the \"the!\"), for more information or to see renderings of what the park might look like. And please help us by backing our Kickstarter campaign, at whatever level you can!\nThanks, and we\u2019ll see you underground!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #36", "update_userinfo": "Another sneak peek: cool 3D model of the Lowline Lab!", "update_content": "Check out what our team is working on right now-- and what we're building this fall!

We're doing a livestream to commemorate the end of the Kickstarter. Check out our twitch.tv page at 6pm Pacific tonight (March 21)! Also, we're partnering with Three Moves Ahead! Check out the latest Progresscast for more.\nUpdate 6: Art Update! You're either eagerly awaiting to see what your reward looks like OR you are holding out until your eyes are destroyed by Graham, Vincent and Campbell. The TIME IS NOW.\nUpdate 1: Hoooooly crap, we hit our goal in exactly two hours! You guys are incredible. In celebration, our first Progresscast is up! Head over to the Updates section to listen if you pledged $10 or more.\nUpdate 2: We continue to be blown away. The second Progresscast is up in the Updates section!\nUpdate 3: We've got a special Dota 2 Progresscast up in the Updates section for backers! Listen and learn (how bad we are at Dota 2).\nUpdate 4: We've posted a Progresscast discussion with Vincent Perea, one of our artist collaborators. We talk about his process as well as Zelda and chicken nuggets!\nUpdate 5: We've released a trailer for Thirty Flights of Loving, Blendo Games' video game short story sequel to Gravity Bone! Get all the details over on the Updates page. \nA few years ago, some guys with careers in the video game industry started producing a weekly podcast out of a San Francisco apartment. We had few goals, except that the show be independent, remain unconstrained by a segment-driven format, and be recorded only with all parties present in the room--not over Skype. It really worked for people, and it became a big part of our lives.\nOver two years, we developed an audience who appreciated our dubious blend of interpersonal chemistry, insight into development and the industry, sometimes-pretentious musings about games, and baffling phonological explorations of Jeff Goldblum\u2019s name. Just check out our archive! (We've heard it's best to start from episode 1.)\nPeople tell us they miss the show. We miss creating it just as much. So, three of us have decided it's time to make this thing happen again. The current core lineup is Chris Remo, Sean Vanaman, and Jake Rodkin, with planned guest appearances by Steve Gaynor. You might unfortunately know us as Boost, Famous, Video Games, and Hot Scoops. We'd like your help. Without you, the puzzle is incomplete.\nWe've never charged for content. Thumbs has always been a purely volunteer activity. That became difficult once we found ourselves the custodians of a moderately successful podcast. The regular time commitment combined with the costs of equipment and bandwidth meant an activity we greatly enjoyed also became a considerable resource drain. Even now, with the podcast defunct, we spend money every month to keep the full archive available through a good host--and that's a lot more money when the podcast is active.\nWe never had the benefit of being attached to a large media outlet. We\u2019ve always relied on the ever-gratifying word-of-mouth provided by our community to get our name out there. Now our goal is to make Idle Thumbs pay for itself so that once it starts up again, we can continue to produce it weekly for years to come. We still have no intention of charging for the cast.\nThat's only part of why we're doing this Kickstarter, though.\nWe want Idle Thumbs to grow. When we come back, we're planning on launching with not just the main video game podcast, but also a book club podcast in which we choose a book to read for a month then discuss it on the air, including with reader questions.\nAnd we want to be able to fund a home base--an office, even a tiny closet-sized one, from which we can record podcasts and plan the site's future. We want to give Thumbs the space to become something more than just a hobby project.\nThumbs has gone dormant several times over the years, only to return time and time again in various forms. This time, we want it to stay active indefinitely, to cast away its once-inevitable biennial slumber--not merely to subsist but to [some kind of metaphor here about a grenade rolling down a hill].\nRewards are rad. Idle Thumbs merchandise has never been easily available, and Kickstarter offers a great system to do something we already like doing (designing and producing digital and physical goods) in a way that will help ensure the future of something we love (our goofy video game podcast). Hopefully, this is just the start.\nHere's what we've got lined up:\nTHE \"WISH YOU WERE HERE\" ($10) \nPROGRESSCAST: Exclusive access to short pre-launch podcasts from Chris, Jake, Sean, and possible guests as they feverishly attempt to get Idle Thumbs back up and running. \nTHUMBACKGROUNDS: Digital Idle Thumbs wallpaper pack for your computer and mobile devices, created by designer Alex Griendling.\nYOU'VE GOT MAIL: We will make and sign a postcard, and mail it to you in the actual real physical mail.\nFOUNDER'S WALL: Your name on a permanent Kickstarter backer page on the Idle Thumbs website.\nINTERNATIONAL BACKERS: Add $3 for higher shipping costs.\nTHE \"VIDEO GAME\" ($30)\nTHIRTY FLIGHTS OF LOVING: Download the video game short story Thirty Flights of Loving, Blendo Games' sequel to Gravity Bone, developed for the Idle Thumbs Kickstarter and featuring an original soundtrack by Chris Remo.

What really happens behind the closed doors of a development studio is often unknown, unappreciated, or misunderstood.  And the bigger the studio, the more tightly shut its door tends to be.  With this project, we're taking that door off its hinges and inviting you into the world of Double Fine Productions, the first major studio to fully finance their next game with a Kickstarter campaign and develop it in the public eye.\nDouble Fine Productions\nFounded in 2000 by industry veteran Tim Schafer (Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Grim Fandango), the San Francisco-based company has established itself as a unique creative force with critically-acclaimed titles such as Psychonauts, Brutal Legend, Costume Quest, Stacking, Iron Brigade, Once Upon a Monster, and Double Fine Happy Action Theater.  This year, you'll be given a front-row seat as they revisit Tim's design roots and create a brand-new, downloadable \"Point-and-Click\" graphic adventure game for the modern age.\n\nWhy Kickstarter?\n\nDouble Fine\u2019s XBLA/PSN/PC title \u201cStacking\u201d\nBig games cost big money.  Even something as \"simple\" as an Xbox LIVE Arcade title can cost upwards of two or three million dollars.  For disc-based games, it can be over ten times that amount.  To finance the production, promotion, and distribution of these massive undertakings, companies like Double Fine have to rely on external sources like publishers, investment firms, or loans.  And while they fulfill an important role in the process, their involvement also comes with significant strings attached that can pull the game in the wrong directions or even cancel its production altogether.  Thankfully, viable alternatives have emerged and gained momentum in recent years.\nCrowd-sourced fundraising sites like Kickstarter have been an incredible boon to the independent development community.  They democratize the process by allowing consumers to support the games they want to see developed and give the developers the freedom to experiment, take risks, and design without anyone else compromising their vision.  It's the kind of creative luxury that most major, established studios simply can't afford.  At least, not until now.\n\n\nTim negotiates publishing rights\n\nKeeping the scale of the project this small accomplishes two things.  First and foremost, Double Fine gets to make the game they want to make, promote it in whatever manner they deem appropriate, and release the finished product on their own terms.  Secondly, since they\u2019re only accountable to themselves, there\u2019s an unprecedented opportunity to show the public what game development of this caliber looks like from the inside.  Not the sanitized commercials-posing-as-interviews that marketing teams only value for their ability to boost sales, but an honest, in-depth insight into a modern art form that will both entertain and educate gamers and non-gamers alike.\n\nAbout the Project\nOver a six-to-eight month period, a small team under Tim Schafer's supervision will develop Double Fine's next game, a classic point-and-click adventure.  Where it goes from there will unfold in real time for all the backers to see.\nTim\u2019s Project Lead debut, point-and-click classic \u201cDay of the Tentacle\u201d (1993)\n2 Player Productions will be documenting the creative process and releasing monthly video updates exclusively to the Kickstarter backers. This documentary series will strive to make the viewer as much a part of the process as possible by showing a game grow from start to finish, with all the passion, humor, and heartbreak that happens along the way.  Double Fine is committed to total transparency with this project, ensuring it is one of the most honest depictions of game development ever conceived.\n\nThere will be a private online community set up for the backers to discuss the project with the devs and submit their thoughts and feelings about the game's content and direction, sometimes even voting on decisions when the dev team can't decide.  Backers will also have access to help test the game once a beta is available.  Once the game is finished, backers will receive the completed version in the available format of their choice.\nFor fans of adventure games, this is a chance to prove that there is still a large  demand out there for a unique medium that inspired so many of us.\nRewards\nThis whole experience is being offered for the flat backer contribution of $15.  We believe that beyond the reward of receiving the finished game, the ability to be a participant in the project makes this a unique opportunity.  \n\nFor anyone who wants to contribute above and beyond the call, we have a selection of premium rewards ranging from a download of the full documentary series in splendid 1080p HD video with bonus footage, to unique posters, original concept art, and even a mini painting of yourself done by the game's artist!   \nFor those of you who want to be really special, check out www.doublefine.com for details on super premium high level rewards!\n\n\n\nClosing\nFor anyone interested in the inner workings of the game industry, either professionally or as a fan, this project will be a landmark in exploring the art of development.  For people that just love great games, this is an opportunity to help bring one to fruition.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #58", "update_userinfo": "Your Final Rewards are coming + Double Fine Adventure: Definitive Edition", "update_content": "Hello, Backers of Adventure!\nI love you!\nSorry, I got a little emotional there.

The Elevation Dock.\"\nTNW: \"The Elevation Dock for iPhone blows away Apple's crap options\"\nCool Material \"The Elevation Dock is, to put it bluntly, perfect.\"\nSilicon Florist \"I... Yeah. I don't even really know where to begin.\"\nAIGA: \"...perfect blend of form and functionality... much like Dyson's fan.\"\n----------\n*Update* Just added Back Multiple Rewards to make it simpler for everyone wanting multiple docks.\nThere is a growing FAQ section at the bottom of the page to help answer your questions. \n----------\nIf you have tried using docks for your iPhone, you have probably felt our frustration: Undocking is difficult, many aren't designed to work with cases, they are lightweight, and are generally made as a cheap afterthought accessory. \nThat's why we designed the Elevation Dock - Simple to use, quick undocking, and it works with or without a case. We didn't stop there - It's beautifully precision machined from solid aluminum and it comes in a gorgeous set of surface finishes, setting a new bar for quality and something that looks really good on your desk. It complements the high-level craftsmanship of the iPhone like no other.\nUndocking is a breeze. Just pull up the phone up - no violent shaking or using two hands to hold the dock down required. This is achieved by a special low-friction connection, the heft of its solid metal construction, and tacky rubber feet.\nCase, no case, doesn't matter. Again, the Elevation Dock is designed to just work. That's why a clever movable support pad allows you to use the dock with or without a case and in a range of case sizes.\nObsessive attention to quality. Elevation Docks are individually CNC machined from solid billets of aircraft grade aluminum, no expense spared. The result is a level of precision that can't be achieve through molding or casting. They feel heavy, strong, durable and look gorgeous.\nWe could have easily made them cheaper with injection molded plastic filled with sand or something, but this is something we want for ourselves and we appreciate good craftsmanship - this probably why we're such big fans of Apple hardware (well... except for those damn docks!).\nGorgeous finishes. We worked with a specialized metal finishing company to help achieve the gorgeous finish you find on Apple's unibody Macbook Pro's and iMacs - its hand buffed, glass bead blasted, electro-chemically micropolished, hard anodized and sealed.\nMakes FaceTime Better. The dock's acoustics make the iPhone sound great and less tinny than when laid on a desk, so speakerphone and FaceTime calls sound better. And its angled back 8 degrees, so you are perfectly in frame of the video.\nPerfect for your nightstand too. Know exactly where your phone is in the dark and be able to just easily grab it. Friends we gave prototypes to loved this and used them more often in the bedroom than at their desk - and they all wanted more than one.\nThe Elevation Dock+\nStep up to the Elevation Dock+ for the addition of a shielded Line Level audio out and a USB wall power adaptor.\nIf you are playing your iPhone through a stereo, Line Level is better than outputting from the microphone jack because it bypasses the iphone's internal amplifier for higher fidelity sound.\nThe Dock+ comes in your choice of the Apple style bead blasted finish or Matte Black. \nThe Matte Black is heavy etched for a true matte finish. Very beautiful how it reflects no light, but watch out for greasy fingers as they will leave fingerprints.  \nCompact USB Wall chargers come with the Dock+ versions. You will have the option for international plugs as well.\nKickstarter Exclusive Finishes\nPledges at the limited edition level can get LimeGreen or SunOrange multi-shade versions. These gorgeous finishes subtly change color depending on the angle you look at them. They are exclusive only Kickstarter backers who have helped get this to market and won't ever be available at retail. They will be individually serialized by laser from 1-999.\nHidden USB\nWe listened - the cord will now be replaceable. But just having a USB port out the back would mean a big plastic USB housing residing there full time and take away from the clean aesthetic.\nSo we designed the USB port to recess inside the housing and the bottom plate will be be machined to fill in around the cord and maintain weight. \nThe result is a  cord that you can now optionally change in length - short if it's right next to your computer, long if it's on your nightstand going to a wall outlet - and easily swap out if it gets damaged. And it maintains the beautiful, minimal look of hard mounted cord. \nMachined & Assembled in Oregon. Not many consumer electronics can say that. Unmatched quality control, speed to market, and the advanced and efficient machining capabilities of machine shops in our area make it an easy choice to manufacture the bodies domestically.\nThank you, thank you. We at ElevationLab design products for a range of industries - from action sports, to hydration, to medical devices - and always see opportunity to make our own, but the upfront cost and risk is overwhelming for our small shop. So we are looking to crowdsource demand upfront through KickStarter and see if we can make a product that would otherwise never see the light of day.\nPlease share with any friends that like well-made products and have iPhones.\n Apple is a trademark of Apple Inc., no endorsement implied.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #26", "update_userinfo": "Introducing Elevation Stand", "update_content": "Raise your monitor for better comfort & posture.

Cheers.\n***Please note, the rails and quick-release plate in the pictures are not included. You will need 15mm rails to use the follow focus.***\nThe 50-Dollar Follow Focus\nAll we wanted was an affordable way to adjust the focus on our DSLRs in a precise, repeatable manner. We wanted a device that performed solidly and intuitively and we didn't want to spend a lot of money on it since we'd rather spend our hard-earned dollars on more lenses or food and beer for the underpaid crews on our low-budget shoots. But such a follow focus didn't exist, until we made one, that is.\nYou see, we happen to have a small uninsulated garage that's heated with kerosene. Within that garage we have a homemade CNC mill that we call, The Robot. Together with The Robot, we began making our dream follow focus. We reimagined and simplified. We added features, tested and removed some features, and added others, until finally, we came up with the 50-Dollar Follow Focus. It's a nifty little device with a self-explanatory name.\nHere are some of it's unique personality traits:\nThe Stoutness of a Lumberjack\nIt's designed to last longer than any camera you'll ever own. We CNC machine most of the parts from heat-treated aluminum, and we designed those parts to be impervious to abuse. However, on the off-chance that you're a world-renowned abuser of gear, you can rest easy knowing that the entire unit is user-servicable, and replacement parts will be available from us, or in some cases from hardware stores or industrial supply houses.\nThe Movement of a Ballerina\nJust because you can't drop a grand or more on a high-end follow focus, doesn't mean you don't need precise control. While it may be unconventional, our design eliminates backlash, letting you hit repeatable marks from either side of the marker. And we added a user-adjustable spring preload so that you can adjust the friction. The mechanism incorporates replaceable teflon thrust washers so it's smooth, almost as if it were lubricated by guacamole. Because of these refinements, the 50-Dollar Follow Focus makes even the cheapest photo lenses focus smoothly.\nThe Detailed Personality of an IRS Auditor\nIt's the small details that make a product a joy to use. That's why we've spent the last year iterating the design way beyond our original notion. We added built-in marker lines. We added a repositionable handle that lets you quickly set a mark, or put the handle at your preferred position. We added user-adjustable friction. We also gave the handles a nice textured finish that feels exquisite on the fingertips.\nEasy to Get Along With\nWe went with a toothed-belt design because it works with almost any lens you throw at it, and when set up properly, has almost no backlash. We coud have done it with gears (an adapter for geared lenses is in the works) but we wanted to avoid having to buy gears for all of our lenses. The belt gets the job done with the least expense. The belts and pulleys can be changed to accomodate any size lens or to give you just the right balance between speed and control.\nA Post-Apocalyptic Instruction Manual\nThe 50-Dollar Follow Focus is probably the only camera accessory on the planet that comes with an instruction manual written under the assumption that you'll be using the device after some sort of apocalypse. While perhaps not immediately useful, it's a feature you'll be sure to appreciate if that day ever comes.\nWhat We Need\nWe've already got The Robot making parts, so about two weeks after our goal has been met, we'll start shipping the rewards. However, The Robot is old and not very fast. It makes a fine product, but it does so at its own slow pace. To make sure the 50-Dollar Follow Focus stays true to its name, we need to be able to make them faster and we need to make bulk buys of the parts we can't make ourselves. To do this, we need your help. The money we raise here will help us purchase some production tooling and will allow us to buy material in the quantities needed to hit our $50 price point. That's it.
