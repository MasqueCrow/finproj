The game last 4 rounds, each round being divided into 3 phases:\n\n Split & Trap: collect cards and try to trap your opponent.\n Planification: choose the cards you want to build and the ones to recycle in order to develop faster.\n Production: produce resources in a sequential order.\n First, both players draw 7 cards from the Development Deck. The cards are divided into 4 categories:\n Structures (Farm, Outpost, ...)\n Specialists (Scientist, Great Army, ...)\n Monuments (Great Lighthouse, Botanical Gardens, ....)\n Discoveries (Moonbramble forest, Subterranean crystals...)\nThese cards are the means to develop your Duchy, enhance its production and earn victory points.\nIn addition to the 7 cards, you'll add a Calamity card to your hand. It's a strictly negative card that reduces your score at the end of the game.\n\nThen, the Split & Trap phase begins. The active player chooses 2 cards from their hand and place them in the offering areas for their opponent.\n\nEach player has 2 Trap tokens, allowing them to place some cards face down. It gives the opportunity to trick the opponent into taking a calamity. It can also be used to protect important cards the player would like to retrieve.\nThat\u2019s the important guessing part of It's a Wonderful Kingdom. Will you outsmart the opponent and read into their actions so you don\u2019t fall into any trap?\nOnce a player placed 2 cards from his hand on the table, the opponent chooses one of the two offering areas, and collect all the cards there, placing them in their Selection Area.\nThe face down cards must stay face down once collected. Choose wisely! When both players\u2019 hands are empty, they move on to the Planning phase.\n\nDuring this phase, players may recycle some of their collected cards to immediately gain the corresponding resources, and keep other cards to build them for victory points or to enhance the production of the Duchy.\nChoosing which card to keep, and which card to recycle will be key to seize the throne!\nLast, comes the Production phase. \nUnlike in other games, resources will be produced in a precise order in It's a Wonderful Kingdom:\nMaterials (grey)\nPopulation (purple)\nGold (Yellow)\nExploration (blue)\nIf you anticipated this phase well during the Planning phase, you will construct cards in chain. With the right timing, some cards can produce during the very same phase in which they were constructed, hence speeding your development up!\nIt's a Wonderful Kingdom is a Modular game. Several modules are modifying the rules, the interaction, and even the difficulty of your games.\n\nDuring setup, choose one of the available modules. There are 3 standard modules, and 1 additional module in the Legends box:\n Quest: complete tasks to earn rewards.\n Advisors: use unique and powerful abilities to change the course of the game\n Menaces: asymmetrical confrontation using the Menace cards to slow your opponent down.\n Conquest (Legends box only): conquer enemy territories to develop your production and earn additional abilities or bonuses.\nIf you want more details about the gameplay, please download the rulebook hereunder (beta version). \nTaxes will be charged to you by your country if you wish to have your rewards delivered outside of the US, Canada, the EU, the UK, China, Hong-Kong, Macao, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, India, Indonesia and New Zealand,   \nLa boite de jeu is a company founded in 2013.

The estimated delivery date for this project is February 2022, though delays are always a possibility. Due to the logistics of international shipping, some backers may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nLOST SHIPMENTS, LATE SURVEYS & REFUND POLICY\nIf your order is lost or returned due to unforeseen circumstances, we will attempt to reship your game one time, free of charge. If you provided incorrect shipping information, you will be responsible for the reshipment fee. If your order cannot be delivered, we will refund your order completely, including fees.\n\nReshipments and late survey shipments will all be sent out at the same time, about 3 months after the start of fulfillment to simplify the logistics and avoid errors resulting from sending numerous single orders.\n\nThis campaign will close 3 months after the start of fulfillment. If you do not provide shipping information by that time, we can not fulfill your order and your pledge will be kept as a donation to the campaign.\n\nFINAL PRODUCT\nThe final look, materials and content of the rewards are subject to change and may differ from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nCanvas: Reflections will be printed on high quality, durable components. The sleeves that come with the game are not only essential for gameplay, they also help increase the lifespan of the cards. Canvas was designed with expansions in mind, so that Canvas: Reflections and future expansions will not require unnecessary duplicate printing of base game components.\nReusability and recyclability\nOur manufacturer, PandaGM, will produce replacement components so that damaged or missing pieces can be replaced with a small shipment instead of a second copy of the game, saving gas and materials. Canvas components are stored in reusable storage bags. The box efficiently holds all game pieces and add-ons without wasted space from a plastic insert.\nSustainable materials\nThe box and punchboard are made from 30% recycled materials for the ideal blend of durability and sustainability. The cards are made with materials from FSC certified sources. Components are printed with eco-friendly water-based ink and varnish. Our premium components are made from wood instead of plastic. The packing cartons are 100% recycled paper pulp.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nPandaGM recycles all plastic and paper waste. The factory is fully air-conditioned for worker comfort and has passed ISO worker health and safety standards, is BSCI social compliance certified, and follows the OHSAS requirements for occupational health and safety.

After two or three plays, you will even find players overlapping turns for increased efficiency.\nThe game is also highly interactive meaning you are never left disengaged, even in a 4-player game. Plan your next turn, keep an eye on who is close to completing orders or goals or plan the best use of the Exchange Student you have in your hand.\n\n\nAn elegantly integrated upgrade system where each order you complete with a vendor permits you to upgrade one of the 11 upgrade locations on your storehouse/orchard.\nUpgrades increase the efficiency of your owner actions, allow you to plant more trees and increase your resource production efficiency.\nCURRENT STRETCH GOAL \nOne of the more unique elements of our stretch goals we can reveal now is the Artist Boost. As you can find out in the Scrumpy Team section, our extremely talented artist Bernie Todd, who was only 13 when she started this project is still a college student and we want to help her out. Alongside game upgrades and stretch goals for backers we also will be hoping to unlock artist boost levels to provide an additional financial bonus on top of the money she has already been paid, to help her with further education.\n SOCIAL GOALS\n\nThanks to the social efforts of many Scrumpy: Card Cider backers, the game will be coming with Storehouses that are dual-layered with recessed spaces for upgrade cubes and gaps for sliding the cards underneath.\n\nWe completed the 7 social challenges below to unlock this exciting component upgrade FOR FREE.\n(we will not increase the cost of the game on Kickstarter by adding this deluxe component to the base game)\n Click here to go straight to our Facebook launch post \n Click here to go straight to our Facebook page\n  Click here to visit our Instagram page\n  Click here to follow our Kickstarter profile\nClick here to retweet our Twitter Launch tweet.\n Click here and click the \u2764\ufe0f to become a fan of the game\nClick here to subscribe to the Youtube channel\nPLAY\n\nScrumpy is a strategic card game for 1-4 players. The game is played over a maximum of 6 rounds, sometimes fewer. Each round has 2 phases: Actions and Refresh.\nIn the Actions phase, players take turns to perform four Core Actions and optional Auxiliary Actions.\nIn the Refresh phase, the game is reset for the next round unless an End Game Condition has been achieved.\nYour objective is to gain the most Prestige from actions like selling cider, achieving Goals, and recruiting a highly-skilled workforce.\nAUXILIARY ACTION (Optional)\nAt the start of your turn you may perform one of the following auxiliary actions, or pass and move onto your core action:\n Sell cider to a vendor: If you have, in your storehouse, the required bottles or barrels, you may sell to one of the available vendors and also remove an upgrade cube from your storehouse or orchard, placing it on that vendor and receiving coins or prestige.\n Secondary action: all the basic workers in your deck (the cards you start with) have a secondary action - depicted in the top right-hand corner - and they can be converted directly into the resource shown: apple, wood or coin. Simple flip and tuck the card as the resource in question (or discard if gaining a coin from the supply)\n Sell one resource: you can sell one resource by discarding the card and gaining coins equal to its value\nCORE ACTION (Worker)\nAs your core action, you may perform one of the follow three actions:\n Worker Action: play one card from your hand face-up into the first available of the three slots in your storehouse, and perform it's action:\n Recruit: You may recruit one available skilled/master worker from the roster by paying the cost. Play that card into the first available of the three slots in your storehouse, and perform its action.\n Gain Idle Layabout: Gain a grey idle layabout card from the supply for free and play that card into the first available of the three slots in your storehouse. You do not perform an action but you gain a coin.\nCORE ACTION (Owner)\nOnce per round, instead of playing a card, you may move your owner meeple and perform the action selected from the owner's office in your storehouse:\nREFRESH PHASE\nOnce all players have played four actions (3 workers and 1 owner), refresh for the next round:\n Remove your Owner meeple from the Owner Action space it used this round, placing it back on the seat. \nDiscard all Worker cards from the Worker spaces in your Storehouse.\n Refresh your hand according to the hand limits shown on your Storehouse:\n  GAME END\nAfter 6 rounds have been completed, or one player has upgraded all locations on their storehouse (whichever occurs first), the game ends.\nThen, use the Scorepad to calculate final scores by adding up:\nThe value of all Prestige tokens collected during the game.\nThe Prestige of Private and Public Goals achieved.\nThe Prestige of Deliveries to Vendors.\nOne Prestige for each Skilled and Master Worker card in players\u2019 decks.\nOne Prestige for every 8 coins. (Retain any leftover coins in case of a tie break.)\nThe player with the most prestige is the winner.\n*rulebook subject to changes\nNow live on Steam Workshop\n Invincible games have been fortunate enough to have a solo Automa designed by David Digby who also designed Eternal Palace, Tinner's trail and Chocolate Factory solo modes and others. In the Scrumpy: Card Cider solo mode setup is similar to that of a 2-player game but you must make cider as efficiently as possible to avoid the best spots being taken by the solo cidery owner, Anna Vaperson\nDue to ongoing developments of the core game, the solo mode is still in playtesting and development but an early draft rulebook can be downloaded here\nEarly version of Solo rules - subject to change - Requires SOLO AUTOMA cards\n As we transition from hopeful campaign funding to manufacture and fulfilment, there are various tasks that need to be undertaken.\nWe will endeavour to maintain semi-regular updates without you growing fatigued by a full inbox and aiming towards the following targets.\nObviously, with Ships' potential to fail to negotiate canals and global carboard shortages, we cannot anticipate all eventualities but will do our utmost to keep you informed and aware should any delays occur. Any timeline is an estimate only.\nIf they are happening, we reserve the right to sell some copies of the game at UK conventions. We will endeavour to fulfil all copies before this. If there are any delays we may need to begin selling slightly before one or two copies are fulfilled to assist with cash flow. Should you wish to you can always pick up from these conventions if you are yet to receive your copy.\nThe last year has not been kind to board game retailers and we have been hugely supported by a variety of FLGS as we developed Scrumpy. We are happy to offer a Kickstarter retail pledge to any bricks and mortar stores and independent game retailers. Please back at the retail pledge and contact us where we will be happy to share with you our retail rates and see what other things we can do to support you with being able to stock the game. \nWe request: \nyour store's email address and store address\nwhich country you are based in\nyour store's website (if applicable)\nWe reserve the rights to place order limits on Kickstarter copies of games. We are also unwilling to provide copies to anyone offering pre-orders while the campaign is live. \n\nGroup Pledges\nWe want to help as many of you to enjoy Scrumpy as we can. Global shipping can be an issue on this front and so, we are happy for groups of 6 or more people who wish to have the games sent to one location to contact us for a group pledge rate. \nUnfortunately, due to weights and taxes, different locations will have different prices so please contact us to find out how we can work together.\nEstimated shipping cost only\nActual shipping costs may be different from estimates, we will endeavour to secure the best rates possible as close to fulfilment as possible and to pass any savings directly on to backers.\nIn very rare cases the shipping price can be significantly higher than the early estimates. We reserve the right to cancel any order and will offer a full refund in these cases.\n Unfortunately, the law also requires us to pay tax in some countries and we will need to charge VAT or similar taxes at the end of the campaign. For example: In the UK you will need to pay an additional tax of \u00a36.60 VAT. The easiest way to look at this is that MRSP is \u00a340 so the lower pledge will still be below this once you pay VAT. In the US there will be no such tax to pay in many states.\nInvincible Games is a new small independent UK-based publisher that has been formed to produce Scrumpy: Card Cider and - hopefully - many more games to come. We are a small team of only 2 permanent staff members and a handful of freelancers. We have spent the past 4 years developing Scrumpy, investing our own time and money into the project, to get to this point. We're super proud of what we've achieved and sincerely hope you share our love for Scrumpy and join our family as a backer today.\n\nIf you want to find out more about us, check out our team biographies below:\n\nPublisher and Game Designer\nFrom an early age, Paul would often be found immersed in the land of board games, whether he was insisting his mother serve him from a kerplunk tube or taking an age to walk to school as he could only move forward when he rolled a 4 or better.\n  Since Paul first started to develop his ideas for Scrumpy, he has been blessed with a young daughter who takes up a lot of his time in the best ways imaginable. Who wouldn't prefer to be crawling through canvas tunnels with an eleven-month-old than working? \n  Scrumpy has taken 4 years, a pandemic, a daughter and the setting up of a maths teaching Youtube channel to fully develop but Paul is excited to be finally at the stage where is ready to be released into the wild.\n  This is Paul's first global release but he hopes it will not be his last with prototypes about smuggling in Cornwall, a dice school, a floristry game and a Euro game set inside the Hippo Falls safari park just some of the prototypes on his development list.  \n\nPublisher and Head of Art & Graphics\nDenholm began his career in board-gaming working as a general assistant for Stuff By Bez in 2019. He worked extensively on the Kickstarter campaigns for Wibbell++ & Kittycataclysm, whilst also entertaining a successful acting and theatre-producing career. He is also a self-taught graphic designer; board games have been an excellent way for Denholm to hone his skills in an applied setting.  \nDenholm met Paul Frohnsdorff-Harris at HandyCon - a board gaming convention that Paul founded and runs - and their professional relationship grew from there. Initially Denholm came on board as a graphic designer but eventually, the partnership grew and he has since been integral in the development and delivery of this project. \nDenholm also works as a junior developer for Alley Cat Games, leading the development of Paper Dungeons, and assisting on Tinners' Trail and Eternal Palace. His first independent game Dice Cruise being released by Talon Strikes Studios in 2022.\n  Despite her burgeoning talent as an artist. Bernie is still a college student. She first started this project at the age of 13 under the watchful guise and support of her father, himself an artist in the RPG world. \n  Understandably, this is Bernie's first major board game project having only provided support with RPG illustrations. Recently she also got a commission for Typhon, a game setting for a book.\n  Bernie also streams some of her art and gaming on Twitch under the username Jozebean. She would appreciate any increase in followers that she receives.\nPrototype playtesting\nChoosing from a hand of cards\nMid-game prototype play\n Replayability, Global Impact and Sustainability", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have a good working relationship with our manufacturers in China who will be working with us through a company in the UK to assist with a punctual and high-quality response.\n\nAs with any Kickstarter project, unpredictable events can take place. Global events such as the pandemic have affected everything from Manufacture and Shipping to the availability of cardboard. The estimated delivery date allows some extra time to account for delays, but it can only ever be an estimate.\n\nWhatever happens, we will keep backers in the loop via project updates, and rewards will be delivered, as soon as we are able.\n\nAbove all we are human and while the best attempt will be made to deliver a wonderful product to you promptly and of the best quality, mistakes may happen.

Not anymore! We are presenting new collaborative and peaceful competitive expansions that will add a new meaning to survival.\nBoard Royale is about to become a truly sandbox game that can be played by all types of players and playstyles!\nYES, we are talking about wild beasts, the army of the dead, and secret agendas.\nLet\u2019s get to know the Board Royale base game and our new expansions!\nWhat did we change?\nWe're excited to announce that we have updated our base game with several changes. Thanks to our previous backers and all players around the world for their amazing feedback. With their guidance, we've added new items to increase our base game item count from 80 to 100. New weapons, fun disguise items, and a more balanced Board Royale Experience for all. If you already have a base game please check out the returning backer section for the included base game update package.\n\nBoard Royale became an adventure beyond our imaginations.  Another shout out to our all previous backers and players around the world! Thank you, for constantly reminding us to add a collaborative gameplay experience. We've heard your call. We waited until we're completely satisfied with the expansion tests.\nClick to download on the App Store\nClick to download on the Google Play\nSurvival 101: This pack is perfect if you want to have a taste of the original Board Royale before you commit to the expansions.

If you have the base game in your hands and want to add our new expansions, this pack is made for you. They will all fit in our Kickstarter exclusive box.

Our new base game, four previous expansions, five new expansions plus a mini travel backpack. All inside one giant box that can store all cards sleeved!\nCollector's Edition: Our Collector\u2019s Edition is truly a piece of craftsmanship. The box is huge and covered with vegan leather. Inside, there is a soft velvety texture housing our new base game and our four previous and five new expansions. There were only 250 Collector\u2019s Editions declared for Board Royale - The Island. 150 of them were given previously. In this campaign, the last 100 are available for you to grab. All serial numbers are individually engraved on the boxes.\n We have created all our offerings as add-ons so that you can customize your pledge as you please. You can add these now on Kickstarter after selecting your reward or just after the campaign from our pledge manager BackerKit.\nUpgrade your box to Survival Crate: One of the most requested items has been a box that can easily store all our cards sleeved!

The Sunset Over Water stretch goals & campaign maintained that bar. For Floriferous we've decided to simply build the game we hope / believe should be delivered from the get go. All of the \"Stretch Goals\" are already unlocked and included upon funding.\nInternational shipping has been increasingly complicated and expensive year after year, including additional requirements to deliver EU, UK, and CA Friendly service.  We fully expect to see additional increases to shipping. If you are able to purchase an additional copy or copies with some friends, you'll have a better price per copy on shipping.

Get Me Off This Planet!\", \"The Siblings Trouble\", \"GemPacked Cards\", \"Heroes and Tricks\", \"Herbaceous\", \"Legendary Creatures\", \"Sunset Over Water\", \"Herbaceous Sprouts\", \"Heroes Welcome, \"Skulk Hollow,\" \"The One Hundred Torii,\" and \"The Whatnot Cabinet\" all successfully funded and shipped to backers. \"Herbaceous: Pocket Edition\" is shipping to backers in April. We strive to run excellent Kickstarters and deliver fantastic products.\n\n\"Floriferous\" is well-tested and balanced. The graphic design is complete and the card art is final. Box and instructions are near final and we have been working closely with our printer. Limited amounts of work will remain based on how the KS unfolds.\n\nThere are inherent risks whenever undertaking a project as complex and large as producing and distributing a board game, but we have over 6 years of experience dealing with these. We've gone out of our way to surround ourselves with experienced board game developers, distributors, and people who have run and launched successful Kickstarters. This team of friends has been exceedingly supportive and we're sure will help as we hit any upcoming bumps in the road. And there are bumps. Strikes, shortages, and shipping delays are all hard to predict.\n\nMost importantly, if something does go wrong, we will keep everyone in the loop as the project moves forward and comes to market. This game will exist because you all will have made it happen.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Floriferous", "descp": "Receive one copy of this relaxing game & the mini-expansion.\nShip: US $8, CA/EU/UK $12, AU/NZ $16, WW $18\nINCLUDES:\nFloriferous\nEarly Spring Mini-Expansion", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,367 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "Floriferous Duo", "descp": "Receive two copies of this relaxing game & two mini-expansions.\nShip: US $10, CA/EU/UK $14, AU/NZ $20, WW $30\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 Floriferous\n2\u00d7 Early Spring Mini-Expansion", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["85 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "Flowers & Herbs", "descp": "Receive one copy of Floriferous & Herbaceous with their mini-expansions.\nShip: US $10, CA/EU/UK $14, AU/NZ $20, WW $30\nINCLUDES:\nFloriferous\nEarly Spring Mini-Expansion\nHerbaceous\nFlavor Pack Mini-Expansion", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["148 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "Flowers & Sunrises", "descp": "Receive one copy of Floriferous & Sunset Over Water with their mini-expansions.\nShip: US $10, CA/EU/UK $14, AU/NZ $20, WW $30\nINCLUDES:\nFloriferous\nEarly Spring Mini-Expansion\nSunset Over Water\nNature's Muse Mini-Expansion", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["204 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "Nature's Bounty: Flor, Herb, Sunset", "descp": "Receive one copy of Floriferous, Herbaceous, & Sunset Over Water with their mini-expansions.\nShip: US $12, CA/EU/UK $18, AU/NZ $24, WW $36\nINCLUDES:\nFloriferous\nEarly Spring Mini-Expansion\nHerbaceous\nFlavor Pack Mini-Expansion\nSunset Over Water\nNature's Muse Mini-Expansion", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["261 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "Floriferous Trio", "descp": "Receive three copies of Floriferous & three mini-expansions.\nShip: US $12, CA/EU/UK $18, AU/NZ $24, WW $36\nINCLUDES:\n3\u00d7 Floriferous\n3\u00d7 Early Spring Mini-Expansion", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["21 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 80 or more", "title": "Floriferous Quadro", "descp": "Receive four copies of Floriferous & four mini-expansions.\nShip: US $14, CA/EU/UK $20, AU/NZ $28, WW $40\nINCLUDES:\n4\u00d7 Floriferous\n4\u00d7 Early Spring Mini-Expansion", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["3 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 120 or more", "title": "Nature's Bounty: Flor, Herb, Sunset Duo", "descp": "Receive two copies each of Floriferous, Herbaceous, & Sunset Over Water with their mini-expansions.\nShip: US $18, CA/EU/UK $30, AU/NZ $42, WW $60\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 Floriferous\n2\u00d7 Early Spring Mini-Expansion\n2\u00d7 Herbaceous\n2\u00d7 Flavor Pack Mini-Expansion\n2\u00d7 Sunset Over Water\n2\u00d7 Nature's Muse Mini-Expansion", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["6 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #7", "update_userinfo": "June Update: Manufacturing Underway!", "update_content": "Team Awesome,\nAs always, I hope everyone is well!\n   "}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #6", "update_userinfo": "May Update: Files Prepped & Ready", "update_content": "Team Awesome,\nI hope everyone is having a chance to start enjoying the spring!

You will find that materialization engaging, and even delightful.\nDoce is a unique abstract strategy game. It's a turn-based, two-player game. And now you can play it anywhere in the world, with an Internet connection.\nTake turns placing dice on the playing grid with the goal of making a line of 4 dice that add up to 12, but you have to follow some unique rules that will definitely pose a challenge to even the most astute among you. It's a game of simple rules and at the same time very challenging and fun to play. The complexity, possibilities, and strategies can run very deep.

We believe this is of great advantage for everybody, especially for people who want to get a mental power up! \nThis is one of our Doce Digital designs\nDoce Classic has been played by enthusiasts since its successful Kickstarter campaign at the end of 2019.

For us, we've decided to bring forward the development of DOCE Digital, the perfect complement of Doce Classic.\nWe, the Smart Iguana Games Team, have been working tirelessly on the Doce Digital Beta version of our DOCE Classic board game. We hope it becomes a wonderful resource for people all over the world: a fun, challenging, and engaging game that can be played with the safest of social distances.\nWe believe in the importance of giving our backers the opportunity to try the game with friends before committing to a pledge. The BETA version represents an essential piece on the road towards our goal and it's 100% operational for you to play and enjoy (check the link to the game right after the How-to-play video section).

Some mind-blowing challenges to power up your neurons. The program will verify your answer and tell you the solution. Want to test your move? Play it against the AI.\n[VOICE-ACTIVATED PLAY MODE]\nThough this can be used by any player, this feature will be specially developed and implemented for the vision impaired. They will be able to speak out loud their command and move and hear back a synthesized voice with the move played by the opponent, like the computer. The contender will have the option to play normally or using this feature. Languages will be added progressively. A very good friend motivated us to include this feature.\n[TIMERS]\nNot enough time to wait for an eternity for your opponent to make their move? These timers will do the job. As with chess clocks, you will be able to set and limit the playing time for each player. \n[GAME NOTATIONS]\nThis option will allow you to save your games and replay them or any other game in the database. You will be able to analyze your games and improve your skills.\n[PRACTICE MODE]\nIn this mode, you'll be able to analyze variations of the gameplay and test them against the computer.\n[ADVANCED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE]\nWe'll take the computer AI to the next level with a self-learning algorithm to improve single-player gameplay.\n[TOURNAMENT MODE]\nThis feature will make Doce Digital an App. Here you will be able to create different types of tournaments, the program will take care of the matching, positions, scoring, and more. It may include prizes, tournament subscriptions, and/or purchases if applicable. You will enjoy this feature with your friends, family, and whoever you want to invite.\n[NEW GAME MECHANICS]\nFor those who like to have different options for gameplay, and like a little bit of luck, we will add new ways of playing. Like Dice Luck, where the player must roll a set of dice during their turn, let's say three, and they have to play one of those rolled dice.\nNote: remember that with the Doce Digital All-inclusive reward you will have access to all these features as they get developed and implemented, even if their stretch goal is not reached in this campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2665 REVIEWS \u2665 \nGAMETYRANT:\n Devon Norris written review \n\nThe Meeple Guild - Yorkton this week\n\n\nSmart Iguana Games is a start-up, family-owned, and operated business in Ocala, Florida, and all around the world.

See below for detailed information about shipping.\nCrafting Arzium is a new documentary feature film about board game designer Ryan Laukat and his wife Malorie Laukat (the core team behind Red Raven Games). Follow the two creators as they attempt to bring their latest game called Now or Never to life!\nWhat is Arzium? Arzium is the world setting of many of Red Raven\u2019s games, including Near and Far, Above and Below, and Roam\u2013among others. Arzium is a fantastical world filled with desert oases, lush pastures, turnip farms, amber mines, jagged mountains, glogos caverns, iron cities, and exotic flying continents! It is a world which has entertained and inspired thousands of gamers and which captures the imagination.\nThe idea for Crafting Arzium came about after the completion of The Game Designers documentary (our first project) and was directly inspired by that movie.\n\nIn The Game Designers we set out to capture as much as we possibly could about the world of modern board game design and we traveled near and far to collect numerous stories and interviews. We followed five main designers and interviewed over 70+ people in total. The result of that effort was a film that was far-reaching and touched on a lot of points regarding the subject.\n\nFor Crafting Arzium we thought that it would be fun to delve into the same topic, however, instead of casting a really wide net like we did last time, we wondered how \u201cdeep\u201d we could go with just one individual. So we set out in our early pre-production stage and made a long list of designers who we potentially thought could work for the film. Over time the list got shorter and shorter (for different reasons) and we eventually decided to team up with Ryan and Malorie Laukat!\nCollaborating with Ryan and Malorie was great from the start and has continued to be a great experience. For this film we wanted to find the right individuals who were willing to be open and honest about their challenges\u2013both in regards to the games they made and also in real life matters. Ryan and Malorie were up to the task and have opened up and shared a lot of great information\u2013which really shines through in the film.\n\nRyan and Malorie are also super talented. They bring a great passion and sensibility to every project they create and have inspired gamers for nearly a decade. It was for this reason that we also decided to make a film about them!\n\"Working with Eric on Crafting Arzium has been an exciting adventure, and it's been very gratifying to be involved. Eric puts so much heart and effort into the work he does. It's thrilling to see what he can create from the simple story of making board games. He has really captured the passion we feel about our work, and the challenges of our everyday life. We are so pleased to support Eric and hope you will too!\"\n\n- Ryan and Malorie Laukat\nCrafting Arzium began filming in June of 2020 and we hope to complete all of the filming by summer 2021. We have edited approximately one hour of the movie thus far (February 2021) and hope to have the film completed shortly after our last day of filming. The film is currently in a rough-cut status and needs to address some outstanding items, including:\n\nFilming the last few scenes\nEditing the last few scenes\nRevising the rough cut for optimal character/plot development\nRefining the rough cut and locking in the final edit\nAdding in more graphics from the world of Arzium\nAdding in more animations from the world of Arzium\nAdding in more music to nail the tone of the film\nAdding opening and closing sequences\nAdding \"lower-thirds\" (text to the film)\nBalancing audio and building a clean aural experience\nPurchasing music licenses\nColor Correction\nImage stabilization\nQuality Control\n\nWith the funds raised from this Kickstarter, we can finish off these outstanding items for the movie and also complete all of the stretch goals. This has been a great project to work on and we want to deliver an awesome experience for all backers--with your help we can do just that!\nAll shipping to the US is free of charge.\n\nInternational shipping for physical reward tiers ($33 and up): We ship to European Union, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia ONLY.  It is a $30 USD flat fee for shipping to these locations and this shipping charge includes all charges (no additional charges will be added for things such as customs, duties, and taxes per region and/or country). Shipping for physical tiers ($33 and up) is not available for anywhere outside of US, EU, UK, Canada, and Australia, at present time.\n\nShipping for ALL add-ons is free of charge regardless of where you live. And we will ship add-ons to anywhere in the world (for digital reward tiers).\nATTENTION! For shares to count toward the share goals above, you must share this post here: Click here to visit the Official Facebook post!\nThe Game Designers was our first documentary project and was successfully funded on Kickstarter in March 2018 (view the Kickstarter here). We had a lot of great support from the community and we unlocked nearly all of the stretch goals. The Game Designers went on to be released on iTunes, Google Play, Amazon, and Vimeo.\nThe Game Designers followed the stories of five board game designers as they worked to develop their latest games. Numerous other designers were interviewed for the project as well and they informed and highlighted specific things about the journeys of the main characters. In total, over 70+ game designers, industry professionals, and other media personalities were interviewed for the project.\nYou can learn more about the The Game Designers at the official website or check out the official trailer.  The Game Designers was a huge passionate project--just like Crafting Arzium--and we really appreciated the help and support of the community to help bring it to life. We hope that you will enjoy it should you get a reward or add-on that includes the movie!\nHi, my name is Eric Rayl. I am the founder of Zoom Out Media and also the writer/director of Crafting Arzium (and The Game Designers). As you might have noticed, I am passionate about board games and movies! I like to tell fun and entertaining stories about different types of creative people and to share their journeys. And so I am super excited to bring Crafting Arzium to the world and to show the awesome talent of Ryan & Malorie Laukat.\nDirector Eric Rayl filming a greenscreen shot with Ryan.\nYou can learn more about Zoom Out Media at our website or visit us on YouTube, Facebook, or Instagram!\nWe would love to have your support in helping us to spread the word about Crafting Arzium! We can only reach so many people by ourselves and we need YOU to help us get the word out there. We don't want anyone who plays tabletop games, or anyone who loves documentaries such as this, to miss out on this Kickstarter simply because they weren't aware of it. Can we count on you in helping us to share the project with your friends and family--and also on social media? Would you share the project so that more people can learn about the movie? Thank you so much!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe believe that the risks for this project are relatively low. About 90% of the footage for the project has already been shot and we are on target to get the rest of the film shot by the end of summer 2021. However, with all things related to film production, there are always surprises that can pop up at any time, so we will try to work through anything like that if it shall so arise.

However, battery capacity is not keeping pace with the power demands of gaming, apps and advanced technologies like 5G. Unfortunately for users, this means carrying more chargers and backup batteries while on the go.\nLow-battery anxiety is real and it keeps getting worse every day!\nThe only real solution is to have a compact, portable fast-charging power bank to reliably power up all the devices you use daily. It has to work fast, travel light, and fit seamlessly into your lifestyle!\n\nSTORM 2 provides a whole new charging experience unlike any other power bank.\nIts Cyberpunk style transparent case marks the new era of power banks.

It is compact, cost-efficient, and the perfect battery station to take anywhere in the world.\n Adjustable DC Output \nA dedicated 3.3-25.2V adjustable & customizable DC barrel port output meets all your specific device charging needs.

Take STORM 2 with you and leave all your other chargers at home.\nFully Recharge STORM 2 in Just 1.5 Hours\nLarger battery capacity doesn\u2019t mean a longer recharge time. With its 100W PD fast-charging DC input, there is no need to panic when your STORM 2 needs to recharge. Just 1.5 hours is enough to fully charge its 27600mAh/99.36Wh capacity.\n\nUse It While Charging\nThe pass-through capability provides users with more charging convenience.

You'll play tricks to each time period as you try to outwit your fellow travelers and collect enough wreaths to decorate all the holiday doors.\n\nGhosts of Christmas is a new version of the acclaimed hard-to-find Japanese game \"Time Palatrix\" by Taiki Shinzawa. Have you ever played \"spades\" or \"hearts\" and thought \"I wish this game had time travel?\"\nAll in a small 5 x 5 x 2 inch box\n\nGhosts of Christmas is a trick taking game where you play cards into three separate tricks: past, present, and future. You visit all three locations in a single round, and winning tricks in one time period could help you win more in the future!\n\nThe gameplay remains the same, but with a new optional variant for a more relaxed game.\nTwelve colorful characters inspired by A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens.\n\nClick to view pdf. (This is a draft, not a final version.)\nTaylor is an avid player of trick taking games and has a YouTube channel dedicated to them. Ghosts of Christmas can sound confusing at first, but Taylor does a great job explaining how it all works.\nPlease Note: Prototype components are shown in the video. The final version will have some minor changes.\n\nAlso please note: This is one of the most creative Kickstarter preview videos we've ever seen. Give it a chance. You won't be disappointed.\n#1 Meeeaty - Some trick taking games are relaxing affairs. Play your highest card and hope for the best. In Ghosts of Christmas, there are multiple ways to approach each round and use brain cells.\n#2 Ripple Effects - When you don't have the cards to win in a straightforward way, sometimes you can engineer a change in who wins the \"Past\" trick in order to make the \"Present\" and \"Future\" trick work out better for you.\n#3 Dials - They're both fun and informative. A great visual way for everyone to keep track of which suit they can play to each ghost.\n#4 Different Variants/Difficulty Levels - If you want a more low stress evening (or you are just learning), play the variant without bidding. If you think you've mastered the game, try playing one of the TWO variants with the \"Beyond\" ghost that add even more options.\n#5 Bidding Options - Speaking of bidding, the ability to place an \"exact bid\" or a \"wiggle room bid\" gives you the option to play it safe or really go for that high score each round. \n#6 Small Box - It's a fact. Games in smaller boxes take up less room on your shelf, get taken to more game nights, and get played more. This is a small box game. (We work to keep even our \"big boxes\" pretty small.)\n\nPut on your hard hat and install factory tiles in this fast, furious and fun game of factory planning. Connect your tiles to build the best possible production chains. Whoever makes the most profitable factory wins!\nEfficiently packed into our 10.8 x 6.8 x 2.75 inch box\nLike Ghosts of Christmas, we're republishing this cult-classic by Corn\u00e9 van Moorsel because it deserves a wider audience. The gameplay will stay the same (if it ain't broke...), but it has brand new art.\n\nOur Touch:\n1. Added a sixth player\n2. Official variant to play without the quick grab element. Details TBD but will definitely be a part of the game.\n3. Added unique names and logos to each of the six company boards and score tokens to make the game more thematic and improve accessibility for color blind players.\n\nPlay solo, with a full table of six players, or anywhere in between.\nWhat's your favorite machine name?\n\nIt's a puzzle, but not a jigsaw puzzle. Like a \"How am I going to connect all of these? Did you just take the machine I wanted? I have no use for blue! Let's play again. I think I get it now.\" kind of puzzle.\nUnique names improve theming and accessibility\nClick to view pdf. (This is a draft, not a final version.)\nPlease Note: The game shown in this review is the original Factory Funner. Our version has the same gameplay, but all new artwork, and support for a 6th player.\n#1 Quick grabbing is rewarded - This game doesn't have analysis paralysis. When the machines are flipped over at the start of the turn, you have to decide which one you want. Too slow and someone will take your machine. Too fast and you will grab one that you thought would work ... but didn't.\n#2 Non-real-time variant - What about groups who don't like that real-time part of the game? We really think that is the best way to play, but we realize it isn't a fun or even possible option for everyone. We're including an alternative rule that removes all the speed elements and is still fun (in a different way).\n#3 Making it work - At some point during your game, someone at the table will be quiet for 30 seconds. Then they will announce, \"I think I can make it work.\" Pipes start getting laid. Reservoirs are moved around. The table will laugh at how ridiculous their factory looks. And in a few turns you will know if what they did was smart or short sighted.\n#4 You Will Improve - You might not be good at this game the first time you play it. You will get better. You will learn. You will overcome. And it will be rewarding.\n#5 Bad Grammar - Factory FunNER is the sequel and a very solid improvement to Factory Fun. It uses hexes instead of squares to allow more creative building, and some subtle improvements to scoring, length, and machine placement rules really improve things.\n#6 Solo Mode - You can play this game by yourself. Never know when that might come in handy.\n#7 On Tour - Factory Funner has a lot of similarities to our other game \"On Tour\".  It shares the roller coaster emotions and intuitive gameplay.  Whether you're building an optimized route, or installing the most efficient machines, you'll feel the same tension and joy of making it all work out.\n\nNote: Our game will NOT be an exact duplicate from these reviews, but the core gameplay will stay the same.\nZee Garcia's Kickstarter Pick of the Week | Dice Tower\nTurn into a high-flying stock trader as you work against the other players to control the market, buy and short stock, and make the most money.\nHave you been pumping cash into GameStop? Want to have the fun of making big bets without risking real cash?\nYou're going to thoroughly enjoy this brand new game that will bring you into the exciting and crazy world of buying and shorting stocks.\n*No financial knowledge required\n** Really does play within 60 minutes \nOur standard box size: 10.8 x 6.8 x 2 inch\nBear Raid is designed by Ryan Courtney, the same mind behind two other mind-bending games, Pipeline and Curious Cargo.\nThese are four of the character you can play as. What should the other two be? Leave your ideas in the comments.\nFor those who are wondering about the name, Bear Raid is a real phrase used to describe when a stock price is intentionally lowered through short selling and rumors.\nClick to view pdf. (This is a draft, not a final version.)\nPlease Note: The game in this video is a prototype and the final version will have some adjustments.\n\nAlso Please Note: We're super excited that Jac, who does not normally make board game videos, agreed to do one for Bear Raid since she's the most passionate person in the world about this game. She is responsible for getting Chad (Owner of BoardGameTables.com) to play Bear Raid and ultimately publish it. Part of Kickstarter is authenticity, so we wanted you to hear from a real fan.\nLater during the campaign, Chad will be interviewing Ryan Courtney about some of the different strategies in Bear Raid. We will post that here after the interview.\nSubmit a fake news headline and win a copy of the game!\nWe're hosting a contest over on Reddit.com/r/BoardGames where you can submit some ideas for a fake headline that will be used for one of the forecast cards in the game!\nEnter today! \u2192\n#1 Shorting Stock - Not many games let you do this. It is so much fun to short stock and then drive the stock down.\n#2 42 Dice & Event Interaction - Not a lot of luck (but some luck). 48 dice. It is a lot. It's not just a matter of chucking dice and moving the prices. Each company has dice, and they interact with different \"event cards\" every turn. It's a cool mechanic that lets you get a glimpse of what might happen next turn, but not a perfect picture.\n#3 Controlling What's Rolled - Not all the dice are rolled. You can influence what gets rolled. Leave dice on a company or take them back. Leave dice behind your screen or add them to the bag. These decisions are just as important as buying or shorting the stock.\n#4 Unspoken Alliances - There's not negotiation. But sometimes you will find you can go further if you and a \"partner\" work together. Maybe one person can't bankrupt a company by themselves, but two people working together can. Just watch out. Most partners want to do about 40% of the work and leave the other 60% for you.\n#5 Quick - Many financial/economic games are long, but Bear Raid packs all that action into 60 minutes.\n#6 Q.E. - Although our other financial game QE is certainly a different game, we really enjoy the genre. We think great financial board games are really under-the-radar. Wouldn't you agree?\n#7 Surprisingly Funny - You expect silly games to be funny. You don't expect a stock market game to have humor in both the gameplay and player's reactions to it. You could almost call it a party game.\n#7 Bears - Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica.\nSave 25% off the future MSRP!\nFor the gamers who want the absolute best from every game, you're in luck!\nWood components for the most handled pieces of Ghosts of Christmas and Bear Raid feel better in your hand.

Clash of Deck is a card game which has been played and tested by hundreds of players throughout its first year of existence, as a French version. The game was published in 2020 in an atypical form: cards you cut yourself from a folded sheet of cardboard. A new standalone expansion was published each month. \nToday, thanks to the feedback and support of its community of players, Clash of Deck takes off with a new edition, available in English. The game will have more conventional components, such as \"real\" cards, larger and of better quality, with a tuck box. \nThe game will be fully translated in English and French!

We recommend the Draft format for your first plays. Each turn, the players draft cards from a common deck to build themselves an efficient deck. For the Draft format, you only need one copy of the Starter Kit. The Constructed format is destined for experts who've mastered the game's mechanisms and the synergies brought by special abilities. Players build their own decks by choosing 10 cards among all the cards from the game. Their opponent will banish two of those cards at the beginning of the game, to form the final 8-cards deck. For the Constructed format, each player must have a copy of the Starter Kit.\nEach player receives a \u201cWatchtower/Stronghold\u201d card. \nPlace the 2 \u201cBridge\u201d cards in the play area. \nShuffle all the other cards into a draw pile. \nThen, reveal the top 4 cards of the draw pile. First, player A chooses 1 of the 4 available cards. Then, player B chooses 2 of the 3 remaining cards. Finally, player A takes the last remaining card. Repeat the operation, but this time, player B chooses the first card. Repeat until each player has 8 cards. Each player shuffles their cards, constituting their hand. They then place their \u201cWatchtower\u201d card in the leftmost place in their hand.\nThe player who crossed a bridge last becomes the first player. For their first turn, they begin the game with only 6 Mana.\nPlayers play their turn one after another. A turn consists of 3 phases:\nPhase 1 \u2013 Mana Regeneration:\nThe player gains as much Mana as the number of cards in their hand (including the \u201cWatchtower/Stronghold\u201d card). Mana is used to pay cards costs. The player can use it during phase 2.\nPhase 2 \u2013 Summoning:\nThe player can spend the Mana gained during phase 1 to play cards from their hand. A player can only play the 4 leftmost cards in their hand (ignoring the \u201cWatchtower / Stronghold\u201d card). \nA card\u2019s Mana cost is indicated in their upper left corner. Mana that isn\u2019t spent during a turn is lost. A player cannot spend more Mana than they gained during their previous phase 1. The play area consists of two lanes. When playing a card, the player chooses in which lane to place it. \nPlayers only summon units in their respective Realm: player A places their card on the left of the \u201cBridge\u201d cards and player B places their cards on the right of the \u201cBridge\u201d cards. There is no limit to the number of cards in a lane. A summoned unit is placed from the player\u2019s hand in the play area, face up, in the lane of their choice, behind their other units already in play. The card remains in play as long as it isn\u2019t destroyed.\nPhase 3 \u2013 Assault:\nA unit has Health Points (HP), and an Attack Value (ATK). A unit cannot attack the turn it enters play. Each unit a player controls inflicts their ATK value to an opposing unit. Units automatically activate in a predetermined order: first the upper lane, from the unit further away from to the unit closest to the \u201cBridge\u201d; then, the lower lane, from the unit further away from to the unit closest to the \u201cBridge\u201d. \nWhen a unit suffers at least as much damage as its HP value, the unit is destroyed. It suffers the entirety of the damage caused by the attack and the card returns to its owner\u2019s hand, in the rightmost place.\nThen, move all the units on the lane closer to the \u201cBridge\u201d so they fill the gap. Units regenerate their HP at the end of the turn. During an assault, a unit inflicts its ATK value to the closest opposing unit on the same lane. If no opposing unit can be attacked, the unit then inflicts its damage directly to the opponent\u2019s \u201cWatchtower/Stronghold\u201d.\nWhen a \u201cWatchtower/Stronghold\u201d suffers damage, shift it that many places to the right in the player\u2019s hand. \nWhen a \u201cWatchtower\u201d reaches the rightmost place in a player hand, it is destroyed: flip it to its \u201cStronghold\u201d side and return it to the leftmost place in the player\u2019s hand. Excess damage inflicted to the \u201cWatchtower\u201d does not carry over to the \u201cStronghold\u201d. When a \u201cStronghold\u201d card reaches the rightmost place in a player\u2019s hand, that player loses the game.\nEnd of the game\nThe game ends as soon as a \u201cStronghold\u201d card reaches the rightmost place in a player\u2019s hand. Their opponent then wins the game.\nThe Solo Mode allows you to play Clash of Deck alone, through a Quick play or a Custom play.  Before playing custom games, we recommend you practice with a few Quick games to learn and discover the rules and the peculiarities of Clash of Deck\u2019s solo mode.

The game evokes the feeling of visiting Amsterdam with friends and experiencing the Dutch culture. Gift of Tulips features artwork inspired by the blue and white delftware pattern that is unique to the Netherlands, the windmills and waterways of the countryside, the flower fields of Keukenhof, and the buildings of Amsterdam.  \nWhen I visited Amsterdam and the Netherlands, I really felt like I was coming home for the first time in my life.  With Gift of Tulips, I wanted to create a game that exemplified my wonderful experience.\nBuild your bouquet, gift tulips to your friends, and create a beautiful Festival display in this gorgeous card game for 2-6 players.\nRead the review https://www.pudgycatgames.com/post/gift-of-tulips\nGift of Tulips Overview\nIn Gift of Tulips, tulip enthusiasts explore Amsterdam\u2019s Tulip Festival to build colorful bouquets and give tulips to their friends.\nPlayers choose between building up their bouquet to try to score major points in the end game Tulip Festival, giving tulips to other players' bouquets for immediate points, and placing tulips in the Tulip Festival to adjust each type's ranking. Each turn, players draw one Tulip card, take an action, then draw another Tulip card and take a different action.\nGame Setup\nGift of Tulips starts with two tulips in the Festival, then players are each dealt two Tulip cards.  Players choose which will start their bouquet and which to place into the Hidden Showcase that may affect the end game Tulip Festival. \nGifting Tulips\nYou can choose to gift a tulip to another player. You gain the value of the tulip given, plus additional points based on the type's current rank in the Festival.\nKeeping Tulips\nYou can choose to keep a tulip for your own bouquet. If you keep a tulip that is ranked 3, 4, or is currently unranked, you will also gain points.\nAdding to the Festival\nThe last choice is to add the Tulip to the Festival.  You can change how the Tulips are currently ranked by adding the Tulip straight to the Festival OR choose to add it to the Hidden Showcase for a chance to influence the ranks at the end of the game.\nGame End\nAt the end of the game, up to 5 Tulips from the Hidden Showcase are added to the Tulip Festival, adjusting the final ranking. Points are awarded to the players that have the most cards of each Tulip type. The player with the most points wins! \nRules and Print and Play\nThe rules are here:  Rules Link (the rules are not final)\nA low-res print and play is here:  Print and Play Link  (this does not feature final artwork, graphic design, or balancing)\nYou can also try the game out on TTS: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2405647152&result=1\nAnd Tabletopia:  https://tabletopia.com/games/gift_of_tulips\nWatch the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpiM2HzDZMQ&feature=youtu.be\nRead the Review: https://thecardboardcantina.com/gift-of-tulips/\nRead the review https://whatsericplaying.com/2021/03/01/gift-of-tulips/\nWatch the video below\nWatch the review: https://youtu.be/TxoPTIRtQDU\nRead the Review: http://www.purplephoenixgames.com/gift-of-tulips-preview/\nWatch the video below\nWatch the review below!\nRead the review: https://www.meeplemountain.com/reviews/gift-of-tulips-review-a-beautiful-bouquet-give-or-take-a-tulip/\nWatch the Video Here https://youtu.be/qcW9Wh9RscM\nWatch the video below!\nPeople sometimes wonder why they should back a Kickstarter campaign instead of waiting to get the game later in retail. The most important reason not to wait with Gift of Tulips is that even if Gift of Tulips funds, we currently don't know if Gift of Tulips will go into distribution. If you wait, you may end up missing out, as we won\u2019t have many extra copies to sell and unless your local store backs the campaign, they won\u2019t be carrying it either.\n Kickstarter Limited \u2013 Gift of Tulips might be very hard to find after the campaign, outside of select conventions. \n Help Us Improve Gift of Tulips \u2013 We have a ton of stretch goals planned to help improve the game for everyone!\nMost importantly, without you, Gift of Tulips would not get created.\nGift of Tulips is a game we truly love and want to share with the world. We've worked on this game for years to make it perfect for you. Gift of Tulips has definitely been a labor of love, as we tried to recreate the experience of visiting Amsterdam and finding a place to belong. We love playing and know you will, as well.\nWe really appreciate your support in making our dream a reality.\nWe would love to support game stores by offering the Kickstarter versions of Gift of Tulips to retailers during the campaign. Back the project at the retailer level for $45, and we'll contact you closer to when we ship out rewards to get a count of games that you wish to get! An invoice will be sent to you before we ship your rewards.\nShipping is estimated to be $10 for retailers in the US, $15 for retailers in the EU, $25 for retailers outside the US and EU.\n\nSocial Goals\nHelp us reach six out of the eight social goals, and we'll add a Best Friend (name subject to change) card to the game! If we meet all eight goals, we'll include a special surprise, as well!\nHere's the links: BGG Page (Sign in to your account, then click the heart button), Facebook, Facebook post, Twitter, Twitter tweet, Instagram, Subreddit, Youtube Channel, and Facebook Group.\nWe will be charging shipping after the campaign ends and subsidizing some of the cost. This ensures you get charged the shipping you deserve. No more, no less.\nBy doing this, we are able to factor in your pledge tier, add-ons, and all fancy things that may occur during the campaign. However, we can offer estimated shipping costs. Below is estimated pricing for one copy of the game.\nPlease keep in mind these are estimates and there can be slight variations from country to country. Also, the more items you purchase, the more shipping will cost. If you have any questions, please email us at contact@weirdgiraffegames.com.\n*We are currently not planning to ship to the following areas: Mexico, Brazil, and Russia.\nTo order a second copy of Gift of Tulips, add an additional $15 to your pledge with no additional shipping cost.\nWe are happy to discuss group orders, but these need to be handled on a country-by-country basis. Please send us a direct message including country and number of copies to discuss.\nGift of Tulips is the eighth project by Weird Giraffe Games.\nWeird Giraffe Games was founded to create games that are easy to learn and play, but layered with strategy.\nThe Gift of Tulips team is made of the following people:\nWe're looking forward to talking to you throughout this Kickstarter and after!

There was something about the place that just felt like home, even though I\u2019d never been there before. It reminded me of visiting my Dutch grandparents, with the blue and white delftware patterns, wooden clogs, tulips, and windmills. I remember growing up and knowing that if someone had a windmill in their yard, they were family, and going to Amsterdam definitely left its mark on me. \nIt wasn\u2019t just the objects I remembered from my childhood, but all the sights as well. From the canals to the fascinating, detailed, and sometimes outlandish architecture, there was something that caught your eye wherever you went. But going even further, the culture also greatly resonated with me. Most people in the Netherlands speak at least Dutch and English, but a good amount of them also speak French, German, and/or Spanish, as well. Historically, a lot of the Dutch people were traders and wanted to speak to you in the language that you were familiar with. It\u2019s that sort of attention to detail and empathy that made me think I was finally somewhere I belonged. \nWith Gift of Tulips, I wanted to create a game that really exemplified that experience in the form of a game. The player that wins will most likely be the one that gives out the most tulips and gives them to a variety of players. If a player simply hoards what they have, they may not get far. \nThe artwork of Gift of Tulips is reminiscent of the flower fields of Keukenhof, the blue and white delftware pattern that is unique to the Netherlands, the windmills and waterways of the countryside, and the buildings of Amsterdam.\nESTIMATED TIMELINE\nBelow is what we think the timeline for Gift of Tulips will be. It's an estimate and we have a buffer, as things can always happen that we don't anticipate. We always hope to deliver early, but we do know the reality of life means that surprises can happen.  \nTHANK YOU SO MUCH!\nWe'd also like to thank the following people for all of their help:\nZach from Board with Friends for making the How to Play video. \nEric from What's Eric Playing, Aaron from Game Enthus, 90 Second Nerd, Open Seat Gaming, Edo from Gaming with Edo, Travis from Purple Phoenix Games, BJ from Board Game Gumbo, Kurt and Traci from MFGCast, Krista from the Board Game Cantina,  Jacqueline from Pudgy Cat Games, and David from Meeple Mountain for reviewing/previewing Gift of Tulips.\nJack from Cardboard Herald, BJ from Board Game Gumbo, Traci and Kurt from MFGCast,  and Zach from Board with Friends for helping raise awareness of Gift of Tulips", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf you've gotten this far, you are seriously considering supporting us and we really appreciate that.

Your favorite songs blasting through the speakers. Candy bar wrappers piled next to a warm drink in the cheap plastic cupholder. Your companion riding in the passenger seat, snapping pictures of landmarks as you settle into the hypnotic rhythm of the road. But be careful: this fun road trip could get dangerous as you drive through Death Valley.\n\nDeath Valley is a pocket-sized, push-your-luck, tableau building game for 1-2 players, with each traveler striving to assemble the best mix of cards in their Journey and Scrapbook in order to win the game.\nDeath Valley is 18 cards, packaged in a portable and durable wallet.\n\nEach turn, players will choose whether to assign a card to their Journey, or move cards from their Journey to their Scrapbook. Cards feature stars (points), special abilities (affect the value and position of cards), and some interesting facts about Death Valley.\n\nEach card also has a hazard (Heat, Terrain, Flood or Animals) listed. Having 3 of the same Hazard visible in their tableau will cause the player to bust and lose all the progress in their Journey.\nAll 4 hazards and their card distribution within the game.\nAt the end of the game the player with the most stars in their Journey, plus any additional points from card abilities, is the winner.\nTo set up the game, shuffle all 18 cards and place 1 face-up between the players. On a player\u2019s turn they have 3 choices: add the face-up or face-down card from the top of the deck to their own Journey, or Rest. When a player Rests, they move at least one card from their Journey to their Scrapbook (stacking them into a single pile if they select multiple cards) and shuffle as many of their remaining Journey cards into the deck as they choose.\nAfter the player takes their action for the turn, they check for Hazards among the visible cards in their Journey and Scrapbook. If they have 3 of the same Hazard type showing (3 Flood cards, for example) the player busts: 1 of the Hazard cards is removed from the game and the rest of the player\u2019s Journey cards get shuffled back into the deck.\nOnce there is only one card remaining in the center area, the game ends. Each player counts up the stars showing in their Journey row. Visible cards in the Journey and Scrapbook might have abilities that adjust that score. Once all effects have been applied, the player with the highest star count is the winner.\nBackseat Driver Variant\nIf you want to really press your luck and give up a little control, try out the Backseat Driver Variant. In this variant players may choose to play the face-up card on their opponent\u2019s journey as well as their own. At the end of each turn you will check to see if either player busts.\nSolo Mode - Designed by Kevin Ellenburg and Mike Mullins\nThe game will come with rules for solo play. Here you will face an AI explorer that thinks through its action each turn similarly to a player (playing the more intense Backseat Driver Variant). This explorer never rests in its pursuit of adventure.\nIf you would like to try the game yourself, the mostly black and white preview PNP is available at PNP Arcade now!\nhttps://www.pnparcade.com/products/death-valley-kickstarter-preview\nIn previous campaigns we created expansion material and used it as stretch goals. Since 2018, we've just given it away from the start. So no worries on whether we'll hit it or not, you are getting bonus content if you pledge here. The free expansion for this campaign is Death Valley: Panamint City.\nThis expansion consists of 6 more cards, letting you customize the deck before playing Death Valley. Before play, organize all the base game and expansion cards by hazard type. Then select 3 Animal, 4 Flood, 5 Terrain, and 6 Heat cards to shuffle into the deck. Unselected cards will not be used. Includes Vultures, Panamint City, Red Cathedral, Ubehebe Crater, Zabriskie Point, and Panamint Dunes.\nHere are the rewards available during this campaign.\n\nTo add more games to your order, you can do one of a few things:\nUS Backers only - to order games that ship now - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"0321us\" to get 15% off  of your order. Your website order will ship now, as long as you don't  order any pre-order items, otherwise the entire order will ship as  soon as everything comes in. As always, if you reach $25.00, you will  also receive free shipping. (NOTE: We previously offered a US Backer  code to combine games to save on shipping, but in most cases this was a  much better deal of free shipping AND 15% off.)\nInternational Backers only - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"0321international\" (REPEAT: THIS IS FOR BACKERS ONLY) to get free shipping on your extra game(s). Note: The limit on this  offer is 3 wallet games (and up to 3 expansions) total, including  anything that you order at Kickstarter. Anything above 3 wallet games  (and 3  expansions)  will end up bumping into the next shipping tier,  which can be as much as  $10 on international orders. These games will  all ship together with your Kickstarter rewards.\nThere are many notable games and we'll be featuring those throughout the campaign.\nWhile the game includes lots of great little historical facts about Death Valley, here's a little history about the game itself.\nDeath Valley was originally Kevin Ellenburg's entry to the 18 Card Challenge: Design A Game About A Real Life Location, and we\u2019re happy to see it coming to life. It has a unique take on the familiar push-your-luck mechanic where players have to think about managing their hazards as well as the card abilities, making each choice matter beyond the immediate threat of busting. On top of that, the gorgeous art from Fachri Maulana perfectly captures the lonely beauty of Death Valley National Park.\nFirst up is Kevin's initial pitch video in it's entirety (note some changes were made to the gameplay and cards throughout development):\nAnd here is the 18 Card Challenge video where it was a finalist, along with two other games that we eventually published, Skulls of Sedlec and Horreos. All 3 of which are available here. \n\n\nWe have an awesome following of repeat customers. As a result, we've built the Board Game of the Month Club.\nIt's a subscription service where you receive unreleased microgames,   promo cards, expansion content, and Kickstarter discounts ... every   month! Supporters also receive from $1 to $10 off EVERY WALLET GAME  that  we make. (Members back our Kickstarter projects at the $1 pledge  level  above.)\nOur 2021 $5+ packages include an episode of The Final Lightyear.\nGather your crew and gear and launch into a  fringe section of space where the law teeters over the edge and a good  captain can earn a living. There's no shortage of threats that endanger  the goodfolk of deep space, but luckily your torpedo bay is full and  lasers are hot.\nIn Lightyear you'll play solo or cooperative with a friend, as the  captain of a so-called starship, in hopes of earning some rewards and a  decent rep. Using tactical maneuvering and dice-based action selection,  you'll work through the sector's small, medium and large enemies trying  to gain rewards and ultimately live to see another day. Customizable  episodes will challenge you with variable enemies and threats while  offering powerful new gear and talented crew to help you in your  adventures.\nOur $10 packages include all of the above and something   extra. Generally it's a tiny game (up to 9 cards), or some expansion  / promo cards for our existing games.\nAnd our $20 package includes all of the above and a copy of   the featured wallet game (or the wallet game of your choice).   The featured wallet games also come with any expansion material that  is given away in the Kickstarter campaigns (like the Panamint City expansion  here).\nIf that sounds cool to you, check out the Board Game of the Month Club on Patreon!\nhttp://www.patreon.com/buttonshy\nThank you for checking out Death Valley!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith our method of publishing and using multiple manufacturers, there's always a chance that one part of the game could come in with an error, leading to delays.

Final version subject to updates.\n\nNew to Everdell?\nCheck out this great How to Play video from Watch it Played!\nWithin the charming valley of Everdell, beneath the boughs of towering trees, among meandering streams and mossy hollows, a civilization of forest critters is thriving and expanding... Everdell is a game of dynamic tableau building and worker placement played over four seasons. Whoever makes the most impressive city wins! \n\nOn your turn, you can take one of three actions:\na) Place a Meeple: You have a collection of wooden Critter meeples. You can place these on the board locations, events, and on Destination cards. Critter meeples allow you to perform various actions to develop your city: gathering resources, drawing cards, and taking other special actions.\nb) Play a Card: Each player is building and populating a city; a tableau of up to 15 Construction and Critter cards. There are five types of cards: Travelers, Production, Destination, Governance, and Prosperity. Cards generate resources (twigs, resin, pebbles, and berries), grant abilities, and ultimately score points. The interactions of the cards reveal numerous strategies and a near infinite variety of working cities.\nc) Prepare for the next Season: Critter meeples are returned to your supply and you gain bonuses depending on the season. The game is played from one year\u2019s winter through to the end of autumn. Players add up the points from their cards and other bonuses and whoever has the highest total wins!\nNew content that will delight and surprise you for many more seasons to come!\nGolden Occupied Tokens\nThe new Critter and Construction cards in Newleaf are played like normal Critter and Construction cards from the base game, except that you use Golden Occupied tokens instead of normal occupied tokens. These Golden Occupied tokens are limited -- a player can never use more than 3 in a game! These new cards are very powerful, so choose wisely which you'll spend your Golden Occupied tokens on! \n\nThrough Every Season Cards\nSince the beginning of Everdell\u2019s history, farming has been a vital part of the valley\u2019s way of life. Farmers face a number of challenges through the four distinct seasons of the year and must adapt as the weather changes. Experience the story of an Everdell farm throughout the year!\nThe 8 new special Farm cards in Mistwood replace the basic Farms in your Everdell game. These often give you the choice of two abilities, and you choose which of these abilities to use each time the card activates.\n\nMore Legends\nLegendary cards represent unique Critters and Constructions that are powerful upgrades of other Critters and Constructions. Use them when you are familiar with the base game, and are looking forward to a twist on a regular game! The More Legends cards in Mistwood are added into a game of Everdell in the same manner as the Legends from Everdell: Collector's Edition.\nNew ideas are arriving every day!\nStation Cards\nFaceup Critter and Construction cards on the Station board work like Meadow cards and may be played on your turn, but whenever you play a card from the Station, also gain the reward listed on the Train Car tile beside the card! This reward is gained after you have fully resolved the played card and any additional cards that may have activated as a result. After you've gained the reward, replenish both the Train Car tile and the card played.\nRemember: cards on the Station board are not Meadow cards, and therefore any abilities that affect Meadow cards (such as the Inn) do not apply to Station cards!\n\nVisitors\nNewleaf is a bustling and growing city in Everdell, and now that the railway system is in full operation, many new critters and big ideas are coming into the Emerald Valley. The Visitor cards that come into play on the Station Board offer players a new end game scoring opportunity!\nTo gain a Visitor card on your turn:\nPlace a worker on the Station. The Station is a shared location, allowing several workers at once, but you may only have 1 of your workers on this location at a time.\nChoose 1 of the faceup Visitor cards and discard it facedown on the Visitor discard pile.\nReveal 1 new Visitor card and choose 1 of the 2 faceup Visitor cards to take and place by your city. If you do not want either of the faceup Visitors, you may draw 1 from the top of the Visitor deck instead. If you selected one of the faceup Visitors, replace its card with another one from the Visitor deck.\nGain the reward shown on 1 of the Train Car tiles by the Station; set that tile aside and draw a replacement tile.\nVisitor cards will score their listed point values, if your city contains their requirements at the end of the game. Visitor cards that you have obtained and failed to please (by not meeting their requirements) are not worth any points at the end of the game.\n\nThe Knoll\nYou may place a worker on the Knoll to choose any 3 cards from the Meadow and/or the Station to discard. Replenish the discarded cards from the main deck, and draw any 3 cards into your hand from the Meadow and/or the Station. After drawing your cards, you may then gain the reward shown on 1 of the Train Car tiles. Set that Train Car tile aside and draw a replacement tile from the bag. Finally, replenish the 3 cards you drew into your hand.\nThe Knoll is a shared location, allowing several workers at once, but you may only have 1 of your workers on this location at a time.\nEverdell has a brand new villainess!\nNow while playing Everdell, you can pit your wits against Nightweave, our newest automated player for solitaire and two-player games. Nightweave is designed to function like a real player at your table: she has her own hand of cards, Prepares for Seasons on her own schedule, and, most importantly, she has her own agenda!\n\nNightweave has her own Big Critter meeple along with 8 spider meeples (not just 6!) that will move about the board to do her bidding -- blocking exclusive Locations, taking events away before you can get them, and even enacting Plots and Plans that will interfere with your options as a player, reminiscent of the Weather cards from Spirecrest.  She has eight different personalities that influence what she targets and focuses on, so there's lots of variety in gameplay!\n\nWhat Happens on Nightweave's Turn?\nTurn over the top card of Nightweave's Activity deck. These cards are the heart of her decision-making during the game, instructing her to play cards into her city, place spider meeples on previous, exclusive Locations, take a Basic or Special event, etc.\nNightweave will perform the first action listed for her current season, if possible. If she cannot perform this action for any reason, she will take the second action for her current season. If she cannot take that action either, she will perform as much of the Default action at the bottom of the card as she can. This could include discarding cards, collecting point tokens (yes, really!), and/or a number of other actions.\nIf Nightweave herself is in the Meadow and there are no spiderlings left in her lair when she draws an Activity card with a Spider or Nightweave icon, she will Prepare for Season. \nThe game ends when you run out of actions and when Nightwave Prepares for Season at the end of Autumn.\n\nCan you stop Nightweave from taking over Everdell? Check out the Rulebook for more in-depth information about this automated player! \nhttps://static1.squarespace.com/static/5eefaf5a2819042bf0d4099b/t/6047b72c79a2da41d1f2a50c/1615312716704/Prototype+Rulebook+%281%29.pdf\nAll items shown are available as add-ons in Kickstarter and will also be available to add to your pledge in the Pledge Manager after the campaign.

Based on previous campaigns, we anticipate that you should not have any additional fees associated with receiving your reward package (customs, clearance, etc.) if you\u2019re in one of these regions. If you\u2019re outside of one of these regions, you may need to pay customs fees, specific taxes, and/or other local fees. Please see the FAQ and check with your local authorities for more details. \nIf your reward is shipping to one of the destinations shown on this More Shipping Destinations chart, we are not collecting taxes or customs fees, but it may ship from a local hub. The Destinations Summary below details which countries are in which regions. \nIf you're outside of the countries included in this Destination Summary, please reference the Expanded Worldwide Shipping details below. \nWe originally did not offer shipping to destinations outside of those listed in our Destination Summary due to cost and reliability concerns. We are now able to offer shipping to all destinations outside of those listed above only if the backer accepts that we are unable to provide free reshipments for any packages lost in transit (We typically offer one reshipment at no additional shipping cost for areas listed on our Destination Summary.) \nWe plan to ship these packages worldwide from our fulfillment center in Germany (for best cost), so please take that into account when considering your import costs. Due to the reliability challenges for destinations not listed specifically in our destinations graphic above, if your package is lost in transit, we will only be able to provide you with a reshipment if you pay the shipping cost again.\n\nBy backing this campaign and asking us to ship your rewards to an address outside of the locations listed on our Destination Summary, you understand and agree that you are responsible for paying the cost for a reshipment in the event that your initial shipment is lost in transit. The reshipment cost for lost packages is the same cost as listed on the shipping table here. You also agree that you are responsible for paying any taxes, customs, and other local fees or charges associated with receiving your rewards. \nWe collect and remit taxes for each of these regions described below, as required by local law and our scope of business. Some regions do require that taxes are remitted based on both the product cost and shipping cost, so keep that in mind as you plan for these costs. Taxes will be collected in the pledge manager after the campaign along with shipping. Remember, we are a US company registered in these territories, so rates may be different than you\u2019re used to seeing for local companies! Please see below for more information about the tax rates to be collected for each destination. The pledge manager will calculate and collect the appropriate tax based on the many requirements in place at the time the pledge manager runs. For all destinations outside of these specifically listed below, you may be required to remit local taxes yourself.\nClick here to see local tax rates in the U.S.\nWe collect and remit sales tax in all US states where we\u2019re required to by our scope of business and local laws.

Three different crops\u2014in this case, pumpkins, corn, and beans\u2014are planted close together. Corn provides a lattice for beans to climb. The beans bring in nitrogen from the air into the soil, and the pumpkins provide a natural mulch ground cover helping to reduce weeds and keep pests away. \nAll the crops, fruits, flowers, and hives are represented by mini-tracks. The areas are interconnected to other elements in the game, giving you bonuses along the way. Many crops generate goods that are used to unlock bonus actions. Advancing on all of these tracks offers various amounts of points, advancements, and bonuses.\nThree Sisters is the brand new loaded roll-and-write game from the designers of Fleet: The Dice Game, Wasteland Express Delivery Service, Piepmatz, Stellar, and more. Three Sisters packs all the decisions and fun of a full gaming experience into an efficient and innovative package. \n The Tractor Meeple is an alternative meeple to Farmer Edith for those extra busy days in the yard!\nPreview Video from Tantrum House \nThree Sisters is played over 8 rounds. Each round, dice are rolled based on the number of players, grouped by number, and each group is placed on a section of the action rondel. Then players take turns drafting one die and using it. When everyone is done, everyone gets another action based on the die that is remaining.\nThe die you take lets you do two things: Work your farm based on the value of the die and then take the action of the section you took it from.  When you work on your farm, you are focused on the zone matching the die value. You may either Plant or Water. The actions on the rondel let you interact with other areas of your yard like your shed, fruit,  or apiary. \nThe player sheets have several areas: Your field, divided into six zones, each containing the three crop types, and various other areas related to additional actions you can take: Fruits, perennial flowers, your apiary, and a shed with tools that have special abilities.\nHow to Play Video from All You Can Board \n Three Sisters has a fully developed solo mode sure to satisfy solo gamers of all types.

This means that while the first round of the game will play normally, every subsequent round will have a weather effect that will provide emergent tactical decisions and opportunities for you as you farm.\nThe weather expansion board sites above the game board and the cloud meeple is used to mark the weather condition that is in play for the round.\n We appreciate SO MUCH that you have considered supporting Three Sisters on  Kickstarter. Shipping is expensive and difficult. Motor City Gameworks understands that you have many choices on how to spend your hard-earned gaming dollar. \nWe would like to help with some of the cost of shipping to make it as bearable as possible. Please see the shipping estimates below. \n All estimates include a significant discount! \nWhile the shipping could change, we have worked very hard to provide the best possible value by setting up partnerships all over the world.  This allows us to provide customs-friendly shipping to the USA, Canada, the EU, Australia, and parts of Asia. If you reside anywhere not listed, please contact us through Kickstarter and we can provide a shipping estimate.  Shipping will be charged post-campaign in the pledge manager. You will be able to confirm your reward, updated total with shipping, and your address.\n *Rest of Asia includes Japan, Korea, South, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, Hong Kong, Macao\n\nAdditional Copies\nAdditional copies will be available in the pledge manager after the campaign for $29/ea. Those extra copies will include all Kickstarter exclusive content.\n\nShipping Estimates for Additional Copies\nThe current shipping estimates are based on one copy, weighing near 1.5lbs. The shipping with additional copies will be calculated based on weight and the shipping discount will come off the top of the total.  The estimates below are for planning purposes,  it may come in less or more.\n\nIn most non-US regions, each additional copy would be $5 additional shipping, up to 3 three add-on copies (4 total copies on an order).\n\nFor US backers,  each additional copy would be $2 additional shipping, up to 9 add-on copies (10 total copies on an order).\n\nAgain, do not add these to your order on Kickstarter, back for one copy and additional copies can be added during the pledge manager.

Before the plane crashes, players must agree by majority vote to Hit the Silk!\nThe plane height is tracked by the Altimeter, which also indicates when you will cast a vote - is it time to Hit the Silk!?

From these, they must choose to keep 4 and openly discard the other 2. \nHere are the cards you might find:\nASSETS\nBriefcases - stashed with loot (at values of \u00a310k, \u00a320k, \u00a330k, \u00a340k)\nParachutes - to save your life\nKnives - to defend against theft\nSelection of Cards from the Game\nACTIONS (when played, these cause the plane to lose altitude)\nSpy - looks at another players' hand\nHandcuffs - attach yourself to another player to prevent them jumping without you\nKey - unlock handcuffs OR open the lockbox\nSteal - speculatively steal from another player \nKung Fu - defend an attempt to rob you\nRevolver - threaten a player with your gun to demand items\nBullet - combine with a revolver to take matters into your own hands and gain loot\nPoison - poison another player to accelerate negotiations\nAntidote - save a player from death by poison\nSUNDRY\nPilot's Licence - gives you an advantage if you're the last man standing and need to land the plane - see section below!\nFlannels - just a pile of laundry, unless you're swindling someone in a trade\nOn your turn card - reference card for game play\nON YOUR TURN\nThe starting player (selected at random) begins her turn by taking as many of the following actions as she wishes:\nPlay Reference Card\nChange Cards (once only per turn) - trade out unwanted items from your hand for new ones. Players will see what you discard. As the plane descends, you'll get more choice in the card draw. \nPerform actions - use as many action cards from your hand as you want. Remember each action causes the plane to drop lower!\nOffer trades - make deals with other players and exchange cards face down. No one said you had to be truthful in the trade right?\n...or do nothing. There's a cost to doing nothing though - the plane drops another 500ft before the next player begins their turn, with one eye on their hand and the other on the Altimeter. \nHIT THE SILK!\nWhen the opportunity arises to jump out of the plane (as indicated on the Altimeter), the players vote to wait or Hit the Silk! If there's no majority decision to Hit the Silk! then players return to the plane and continue negotiating and seeking out the items and loot they need. \nIf there's a majority vote to Hit the Silk! everyone jumps out of the plane. Then players reveal all of their cards and find out whether the team has sufficient cash to pay off the casino (and hopefully some surplus!).\nAnyone handcuffed to someone wearing a parachute gets dragged off the plane and the fates of the two are entwined. Two parachutes will save them, one will not.\nSTRATEGY\nBe careful what you reveal! In collaborating with others, you will need to convince them you have a parachute and sufficient cash. Here's the catch - in doing so, you make yourself vulnerable to theft or attack from the desperate. \nYou have a number of tactics at your disposal: trades (you can cross someone or trade honestly), bluff about your hand, defend your assets with a weapon, or go after a parachute by theft or force. Be warned - alliances can be fragile and you definitely can't rest on your laurels. Fortunes can change in the turn of a hand. \nWAYS TO WIN\nYou land safely as part of a group with enough cash to pay off the casino\nIf left on the plane without a parachute, you skilfully land the falling plane (see below)\nWAYS TO LOSE\nYou land safely, but without enough cash between you. Without the casino's money, you're as good as dead\nYou're killed (shot, poisoned or handcuffed to someone without enough parachutes between you)\nYou're left on the plane without a parachute and it crashed into a lake, mountain or runway\nLAND THE PLANE!\nWithout a 'chute, left high and dry, any stragglers get a last ditch attempt to land the plane. Flying isn't exactly your forte, so don't expect good odds. Maybe lady luck will be on your side though. \nThe Card Organiser is flipped to play the Finale Ending\nPlayers flip the board over and navigate the mini game with two dice that determine the direction and distance of plane movement. Luck interweaves strategy as your decisions and dice rolls guide the plane closer to the ground. It's a frantic attempt to dodge the lake, land and screech to a halt before the aircraft hits the mountainside. \nRULEBOOK\nAbove, we've tried to introduce the game in a story telling way, but if you're looking for a deeper understanding of the rules,  here's our draft gameplay guide.\nYou can also get an idea of how to play from this video put together by Lance of Love2Hate Board Games:\nNORTHERN DICE\n\"It\u2019s nail biting stuff, and it\u2019s that captivating theme and engagement that we loved.\" Read Northern Dice's excellent preview: A 5000ft Leap Of Faith\n\nBOARD GAME REVIEW\n\"There is a lot of mayhem, amusement and take that packed into the deck of cards.

We'll then provide a cut off date for getting that detail to us and lokck in the final numbers of production and finalise the specifications. \nFrom there, we'll send the files over to LudoFact and they will pass through data control. We know from experience of working with them that they are reliable and communicative. We anticipate that production will finish in the Autumn and we will then move into fulfilment in the early Winter. \nAny questions, do drop us a note! \nShipping Costs will be collected after the campaign ends.

In early 2020, it was re-imagined during lockdown as a semi-cooperative, social game.  We hope you will help us bring it to life. \n\nThanks for reading about our project! Do message or email us if you have any questions. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSECOND KICKSTARTER PROJECT\n\nWe're still fairly new to the board game category, but we do have the experience of running a successful campaign the first time around, delivering 75% of orders ahead of schedule. We also many years experience in delivering successful games in a parallel industry: escape rooms. There's a lot of transferred knowledge we bring with us. Whilst we are reaching a new audience for board games, we do have an established following of gamers and marketing experience in the team to extend our reach.\n\nPRODUCTION VALUE\n\nOur default is to always aspire to the highest quality available; the challenge is that this needs balancing with affordability. We're asking for backing for a new project and are aiming for a price point that is attractive to supporters without compromising on component quality. We're working with industry experts to find this balance.\n\nMANUFACTURING & SHIPPING DURING COVID-19\n\nAs with any large volume order, there is an inherent risk of delay to project delivery. Experience shows us to manage this risk best, we need to work with reputable suppliers who have a track record of delivery high quality projects to an agreed timescale. The COVID-19 pandemic presents many unknowns and may delay the production a little, but happily, we are sourcing from European suppliers so we are unlikely to see significant delays. We have had their assurances that the impact is minimal at this time.\n\nWe have developed the product as far as possible (manufactured prototypes; fully tested game play; artwork design signed off; marketing plan devised) prior to manufacture. Therefore, we do not foresee any delays from our end. We're excited by the prospect of Kickstarter support bringing this game to market.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nReusability and recyclability\nWe are working with eco-conscious European suppliers that have a green promise. It is intended that we will make the product fully from recyclable materials to avoid any landfill increase.\nSustainable materials\nCardboard: the paper industry is very energy-intensive, however most of the required energy can be produced in-house via renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. We will seek out the cardboard with the highest possible percentage of recycled material saving resources and consuming the least energy. Where wooden pieces are used (minimal), sustainable forestry will supply. We aspire to avoid plastic.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nWe insist on working with a factory that has an eco-conscious policy that invest in renewable energy and use local/regional sources to avoid unnecessary long distance haulage.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Strapped in!", "descp": "Access to all project updates and a chance to buy anything advertised in the campaign (although at a higher price after the campaign closes) or pick up any other products you may have missed from previous campaigns.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2021"}], "stat": ["35 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a322 or more", "title": "Hit the Silk!", "descp": "Hit the Silk! board game, available at \u00a322 (discounted from the retail price)\nPledge for the game now and shipping costs are collected after the campaign ends.
