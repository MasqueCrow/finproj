You are now a fully fledged adventurer ready to make your name known in all the lands. However, this time, you will go it alone. Farrador is a relatively peaceful region; however, menacing monsters reside in the shadows of even the brightest lights. You are being called to explore abandoned mines, save villages from devastating foes, and claim your name as the next true adventurer. All this and more will be possible as you go Into the Unknown!\nInto the Unknown is a true solo adventure for characters level 1-5 for 5e, B/X, or Swords & Wizardry!\nArtwork by Francesca Frisinelli\nTrue solo modules are just that... solo. These books are designed to be played by a single player using the 5th Edition, B/X, or Swords & Wizardry systems. If you have ever read a Pick-a-Path, Choose Your Own Adventure, or Endless Quest book, you will feel right at home with Into the Unknown. These adventure campaigns are designed in that way where you choose your own fate as you decide where to go and what to do while adventuring through Farrador. You play your character and the monsters or encounters in which he or she explores. Gone are the days of wishing for a group to play with! Now your own fate is in your hands.\nThis book may also be run with one GM and one player. The text will be nearly flawless to play this way; however, the only real difference is the layout of the book does not follow traditional RPG books Pacesetter or other companies use when creating campaigns/modules. It does read like a Choose Your Own Adventure. For example, if you decide to go into the cave mouth, turn to page 23. If you choose to scout around the entrance first, turn to page 24. So on and so forth.\nA quick note from, me, the designer and project manager, Ben Barsh:\nI could not be more excited to bring this book to life. I have worked on many projects in my small career as designer; however, none have hit the nostalgia cord like this one. I began playing 1st Edition in my late middle school years (2011-ish). Other than small games with my father and at conventions, I was not exposed to a true campaign due to lack of a group. This problem was resolved through solo adventures. \nI immediately played through the first three solo modules my father wrote through Pacesetter. I believe I finished adventuring in 2 days (school got in the way). I sprinted downstairs after my final encounter and begged him for more adventure my 3rd level Ranger, Grimlon, could go on. He dusted off his old TSR solo adventures and off I was on my next great adventure.\nHere I am in 2020 having the honor of bringing this module to life. This campaign is truly special to me. I want to thank all of you for visiting this page and potentially backing. You are quite literally making a childhood dream come true.\nArtwork by Raven Evermoor\nThis book will include:\n64+ pages of adventure\nFull color interior (art and maps)\nNew Magic Items\nNew Monsters\nAnd more pending stretch goals!\nThe adventures you go on will take place in Farrador. This is a region of Dagmore (Ben Barsh's world being developed). This campaign is a sandbox solo story. You make your own decisions as you go, and they will lead you down different paths to the conclusion. As you can see by the map below, there are many areas to explore in Dagmore. Pending your decisions, you may even explore all areas!\nCartography by Raven Evermoor\nAdventuring solo is not an ordinary practice for many. It presents a different array of challenges that normal RPGs do not fall victim to. In an effort to quell the fire of uncertainty, Pacesetter has developed our SoloSystem\u2122 that is included in the beginning of every solo module we create. This outlines tips on how to adventure, rules to modify or keep in mind, and recommendations on how to go about mapping, resting, hirelings, experience, death, etc. We also introduce the idea of Adventure Points to help your character overcome great threats!\nYour character will start with a new \u201cstat\u201d called Adventure Points (AP). Your PC will have a number of APs equal to their character level: A second level character will start the game with an AP 2. Each time you gain a level, you add an amount of APs equal to your new level. For example, a second level character starts with AP 2. The adventurer advances to third level and gains 3 APs. If your character had not used any APs, they would now have a total of AP 5. APs are not regenerated by rest. When used, they are gone until you gain more by level advancement.\nAPs are used as a mulligan. If your character failed a specific die roll, they can spend one AP to change the die roll to match the desired/required result. This can be done for saving throws, attack rolls, skill checks, find a secret door, etc. Also, an AP can be used to grant a reroll at any time, such as damage rolls, hit point generation, etc. Furthermore, you can use an AP to alter a described result.\nThese tips and recommendations will be fitted for each game system. For example, experience does not function the same in 5e, B/X, and S&W, so we will have a section specifically designed for teaching you how to reward yourself experience.\n$15 Digital Defender - Single PDF - You will receive a PDF copy of Into the Unknown in 5e, B/X, or S&W.

This is absolutely FREE to all backers at a physical pledge or higher. This can be used while playing so you do not have to flip back and forth between pages or simply put in a frame for you to proudly display for guests!\n$3,000 - Pacesetter Character Sheets - (Unlocked!)\nThis stretch goal is absolutely FREE to all backers who back at least the PDF level. Once we have raised $3,000, we will add our character sheets to the appendix of the book or send them as a separate PDF. The 5th edition sheet was designed by Wonkee (our amazing interior artist and cartographer). They are an amazing addition to any campaign fueled by Pacesetter! The B/X and S&W sheets were designed by our fearless leader Bill Barsh!\nThere will be a separate character sheet for 5th edition, B/X, and S&W.\n$4,000 - More Art! - (Unlocked!)\nOnce we have raised $4,000, we will add in 2 more interior pieces by the amazingly talented Raven Evermoor! These art pieces will continue to help bring the visual life to the book!\n$5,000 - Character Creation Section - (Unlocked!)\nThis stretch goal is absolutely FREE to all backers who back at least the PDF level. Once we have raised $5,000, we will add character creation charts for your use. These charts will be tailored precisely to the campaign that follows. There will even be recommendations on how to build characters for solo adventure! Your generated character will be ready for the adventure! The following charts will be available for your use: class, race, background, personality traits, flaws, and quirks.\nThere will be a separate character creation section for 5th edition, B/X, and S&W!\n* Note: The listed charts are subject to change before final layout. If you would like to recommend a chart, leave us a comment :) *\n$6,000 - More Art! - (Unlocked!)\nOnce we have raised $6,000, we will add in 2 more interior pieces by the amazingly talented Raven Evermoor! These art pieces will continue to help bring the visual life to the book!\n$8,000 - New Subclass! - (Unlocked!)\nOnce we have raised $8,000, we will publish the Elemental Ranger in the book as a new option for you to play! This is a new subclass of ranger that calls upon four of the natural elements of the world: fire, earth, water, and air. You may now use these forces to amplify attacks, defense, or tactical maneuvering.\nThis subclass will function more or less the same in each edition this book is being released for. Obviously the mechanics will be different; however, we will stay true to the original abilities and perks for becoming an Elemental Ranger.\nThe Elemental Ranger is woven into the unique lore of Farrador Keep, a college of sorts for those wishing to become adventurers. This subclass does not specifically given any sort of advantage over other during solo play, but it does give a unique twist that allows you to personalize your ranger more than ever.\nThis subclass will be available for playtest and review before the books are printed as long as there is interest! If there is interest in this, leave us a comment! If there is enough intriguing minds, we will release these early for you to try out!\n$10,000 - More Story! - (Unlocked!)\nOnce we have raised $10,000, I will write in another story arc for the campaign! As we know, your decisions in pick-a-path/solo adventure style books can take you anywhere. This stretch goal will add in more options of adventure. Think of it like a different branch has been unlocked! This will feature the same color maps and art used in the rest of the book. The adventure will remain levels 1-5, which makes it more re-playable.\n$12,000 - Another New Subclass! (Unlocked!)\nOnce we have raised $12,000, we will publish the Path of the Ruinseeker Barbarian! This new subclass allows barbarians to harness the wild and untapped magic that lies within!\nFor 5th edition, this is quite simple. You will be able to choose Path of the Ruinseeker as your primal path at third level. This subclass will allow you to access the sorcerer spell list, cast spells while raging, and relentlessly cast allowing yourself to exchange physical exhausting for more spell damage (the latter two being unlocked at higher levels).\nFor B/X and Swords & Wizardry, we will be introducing the barbarian class as an option of play. Along with that, you will be able to choose to be the Path of the Ruinseeker. This will function similar in each edition allowing your barbarian to be opened to their primal magical nature. \nThe Path of the Ruinseeker Barbarian is woven into the unique lore of Farrador Keep, a college of sorts for those wishing to become adventurers. This subclass does not specifically given any sort of advantage over other during solo play, but it does give a unique twist that allows you to personalize your barbarian more than ever.\nThis subclass will be available for playtest and review before the books are printed as long as there is interest! If there is interest in this, leave us a comment! If there is enough intriguing minds, we will release these early for you to try out!\nArt by Francesca Frisinelli\n$14,000 - Alternate Ending - (Unlocked!)\nOnce we have raised $14,000, I will write in an alternate ending for this story! Since the ending will be relatively similar in each playthrough, I would like to add in another for those who are going to play the module more than once. This will also help keep the sandbox nature of the adventure rather than have the ending be on the railroad tracks (an inevitable feature of many RPG books). This ending will be woven into the fabric of the adventure as to keep the sense of the unknown alive!\n$22,000 - New Dwarf Playable Subrace - (Unlocked!)\nOnce we have raised $22,000, we will publish the Bijou Dwarf!\nThis new race of dwarves are close cousins those that reside within mountains. Once a sturdy, formidable people have now turned to the more elegant side of life. They found a wealth of gems and other minerals in their mines, and now they prefer to focus on the finer side of life.\nThe Bijou (bee-zho) are native Dun Bhuldar within Farrador. This makes them an amazing and seamless subrace to bring your adventure to life! They are naturally charismatic and openly welcome the presence of magic within their settlements. They are constantly looking to grow their wealth; however, they still do take care of others as they are constant donors to the less fortunate living within Lakeshire or other villages living in squalor. However, there are few that believe they should join higher societies of humans and elves in other lands.\nArt by Raven Evermoor\n$24,000 - New Finfolk Playable Race - (Unlocked!)\nOnce we have raised $24,000, we will publish the Finfolk!\nThe finfolk are a race of humanoid fish-like people that are natives to Starland Bay area in southern Farrador. Their communities are very welcoming and wise people that take in anyone that is in need. Originally, they were coastal settlers; however, some hungered for what the rest of the world had to offer, so they set out to explore what other settlements had to offer. Since then, they have been good neighbors and allies to those residing within Farrador. \nThe finfolk are natural hunters and/or healers. Since their settlements started out in recluse from conventional society, they have had to rely on themselves for survival. They are dexterous and wise, which many account to be the pinnacle of their survival. Being naturally amphibious creatures, they excel in water type scenarios as well.\nArt by Raven Evermoor\n$26,000 - Farrador: A History - (Unlocked!)\nOnce we have raised $26,000, the Farrador: A History add-on book will be available!\nThis book will encompass all the known history of Farrador and how this land came to be. It will include extra information on each settlement as well as the history of how it has come to the modern point in time where you are adventuring.\nIt will also include the new classes, subclasses, races, subraces, magic items, and spells that you can encounter during your adventures. This way if you would like to take these new goodies to a different campaign, you can do so without carrying around your copy of Into the Unknown. \nThis book will be a $10 physical add-on and a $5 PDF add-on through Backerkit post-campaign. It is estimated to be a 28 page, full color digest book.\nCover by Dmitry Yakhovsky\nAll digital rewards will be send via email after the Backerkit and production is completed. We will also be sending the PDF through Backerkit and DriveThruRPG! We will notify you by updating the Kickstarter when the emails have been sent.\nWhen the Backerkit site for this project is ready, you will receive an email. This is a separate communication than the Kickstarter survey. In that email you, will receive the link to the site where you will be asked to verify your shipping information, your pledge rewards, and checkout through their system. Your Kickstarter pledge amount does not include shipping. It is during Backerkit checkout that your shipping cost is calculated and charged. U.S. shipping cost will be around $5 via media mail. International shipping is charged at cost. If you would like a quote, message us here!\nRetailers: Your shipping is included in your pledge level. You will only need to fill out the Backerkit survey to confirm your e-mail and shipping address. Again, this pledge level is for U.S. retailers only.\nPacesetter Games & Simulations has been producing old school adventures and supplements since 2008. We have produced more than 50 products in print form including several boxed sets. In general we produce content for the world's most famous fantasy RPG system (first and fifth editions as well the BX edition) but also for game systems including Swords & Wizardry, the DCC RPG, and soon Call of Cthulhu. In addition, Pacesetter produces a large line of miniature figures for all of these game systems. We attend several game conventions every year and operate one of the longest-running old school RPG tournaments in the country. Pacesetter has brought back the solo module as well as cross-platform adventures (The Red Queen series).\nBill Barsh has worked in the gaming world since 1978 and produced material for Task Force Games and Hero Games. Bill was a member of the Metro Detroit Gamers beginning in 1977 and assisted with running some the country's largest game conventions throughout the late 70s and early 80s including Origins (when it was held in Detroit). Bill also published the Deck of Many Things magazine throughout that era.\nBen Barsh started working at Pacesetter in 2015 and produced his first KS project, Rise of the Nefarious (a 5e mini-campaign) in 2018. Ben's title at Pacesetter is Operations Manager - that means he is the driving force behind how we get things done. His first major project, Rise of the Nefarious, was resounding success and ran flawlessly. He is also credited for Reaping at River's End and the Book of Beginnings, Pacesetter's most recent 5th edition products.\nFacebook\nWebsite\nTwitter\nInstagram", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith any crowdfunding program, there is the risk of being late on delivery. This project is subject to various risks such as supplier failure, production company disruptions, and damages to books during the shipment process. Any and all prevention techniques will be implemented such as constant communication and updates, a strict and organized schedule, and working hard to be ahead of an unforeseeable curve to limit any issues that make come to be. In addition, to mitigate logistical delays we are using a US-based printer.\n\nWe also are aware of the negative impacts COVID-19 has brought to U.S. based businesses. We will continue to monitor the situation and work in accordance with local, state, and national safety procedures. We will work diligently to get ahead of our timeline so if the project is delayed due to COVID-19, we will have some buffer time. \n\nWith all that said, the rough design of this project is complete. We will have the manuscript edited and thoroughly playtested. Stretch goal artwork is either completed or in production. As the Kickstarter moves along, we will be posting sample pictures of the books and their content.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 8 or more", "title": "Our Gratitude", "descp": "No reward but our gratitude for supporting the project.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Digital Defender - Single PDF", "descp": "You will receive a PDF copy of Into the Unknown in 5e, B/X, or S&W.

You and your crew can pilot breathtaking starships, face down alien horrors, battle evil space wizards, and explore the furthest reaches of the galaxy.\n Get the FREE demo for the Dark Matter Starter Kit and start playing today!\nNew pledge tiers will be unlocked as you meet stretch goals!\nDark Matter is for any player or GM who wants a little more sci-fi at their table. Though it's a full 298-page campaign setting, Dark Matter is designed with flexibility as a top priority: the rules and options in Dark Matter can seamlessly be applied to any 5E campaign from definitely-not-Star-Wars settings to all-inclusive fantasy games.\nConspiracy in the Stars! is a brand-new adventure for Dark Matter! Dive into the seedy underbelly of Port Nomad and unravel its mysteries in this 56-page neo-noir thriller. Designed for characters of 3rd to 5th level.\nThe starter kit contains everything you need to get started playing Dark Matter right away! It contains a full adventure, Conspiracy in the Stars!, pregenerated characters, a GM Screen, Basic Dark Matter rules, dice, battle maps, and more! With this box, you can dip your toes into the sprawling universe of Dark Matter, even if you\u2019ve never played DnD before. Makes a great gift for newbies and RPG veterans alike!\nYou can get the following items by increasing your pledge by the listed amount. At the end of the campaign, you will receive a survey (via the pledge manager BackerKit) asking you to choose which add-ons you want for the extra funds you added.\n(You can also choose add-ons after the campaign, but pledging for add-ons during the campaign helps to unlock more stretch goals.)\nShipping for add-ons will be calculated on the BackerKit pledge manager.  \nHematite Dice from Level Up Dice\nWe\u2019ve partnered with Level Up Dice to make custom, handmade  Kickstarter-exclusive dice made from quality hematite, featuring a unique font and color, available nowhere else!\nDice Vault from Wyrmwood\nWe've also brought Wyrmwood on board for the perfect dice companion: an elegant, luxurious case, custom-engraved with the Dark Matter logo and made from fine wenge wood. These cases are handmade, magnetic Kickstarter-exclusives, and are positively gorgeous. \nCaptain's Log from Rook and Raven\nCompleting the trifecta of perfect RPG companions, we have the Captain's Log from Rook and Raven. We're working with the best notebook company out there to make a custom Dark Matter campaign diary, featuring unique character sheets and pages to immortalize your sci fi campaign.   \nUNLOCKED | This compact bundle comes with essential maps for any starfaring crew: ship interiors for three vessels, as well as a beautiful, asteroid-strewn starmap for space combat, on a fold-out double-sided map. Plus, it comes with 30 1-inch scale ship tokens, so you can play out elaborate space battles with minimal setup, and without an expensive fleet of miniatures. When unlocked, it will be available as a digital + physical add-on for $25.\nUNLOCKED | In this new lighthearted campaign for Dark Matter, you play second-rate mercenaries working for a third-rate mercenary company, Grax\u2019s Guys for Cheap. As part of your contract, you take whatever nonsense oddball jobs come across your desk, and your boss, none other than Grax himself, has more than enough to keep you busy. Each chapter of this campaign functions as a slapstick one-shot, as you are recruited to some new, ridiculous job for yet another unstable client.\nThis campaign comes from the very same writers that brought you Conspiracy in the Stars! When unlocked, it will be available in print-ready PDF as an add-on for $15.\nUNLOCKED | Want even more tokens of the alien beasts and magical constructs from Dark Matter? No problem! This bundle comes with another 40 tokens of alien beasts and baddies, as well as a double-sided, four-page fold-out map that places your characters on the strange alien worlds of the Galactic Frontier.\nUNLOCKED | If you\u2019re accustomed to using high-quality spell cards for every wizard and cleric you play, these cards are a must-have. You can enjoy easy reference for spells, familiars, and ship combat roles, while your GM can keep hazard cards near at hand, in case you fly too close to a star.\nUNLOCKED | In this new campaign, you play a team of mecha pilots for the Lakshay defense force. Fresh out of training, you\u2019re given your first assignment: hunt down one of your own. A legendary Lakshay pilot has turned cloak, going AWOL with his custom prototype frame, a cutting-edge mech of unsurpassed power. It\u2019s your job to hunt him down, and discover what infernal plot is brewing at the center of the Warzone.\nThe most elite Lakshay pilots, called Oni, are recognized only after one hundred confirmed kills. As you battle through the Warzone, you scratch tally marks on your frame, counting up your One Hundred kills, until you achieve the rank of Oni, or die trying.\nThis campaign has an all-star cast of writers on board, and will feature an entire set of rules to make your next 5e game a mecha thrill ride. When unlocked, it will be available in PDF as an add-on for $20.  \nUNLOCKED | This deck of 50 high-quality tarot cards contains beautiful illustrations on one side, and full monster statistics on the other. With this deck at hand, you never need to crack open the Dark Matter book for monsters, NPCs, or mega creatures. When unlocked, will be available as an add-on for $15.\nUNLOCKED | We know that not everyone can meet their regular tabletop group face-to-face at the moment, so if we meet this stretch goal, we\u2019re going to bring Conspiracy in the Stars! (as well as all the other Dark Matter rules that come with it) to a virtual tabletop near you. When unlocked, it will be available as an add-on for $25, which includes high-resolution maps, tokens, and other VTT essentials.

Adventurers who delve within may discover a profusion of odd mosses and fungi, an ancient tomb complex, the lairs of weird, subterranean monsters, and the hide-out of an exiled illusionist. The Incandescent Grottoes is a companion adventure to Gavin's previous scenario, The Hole in the Oak. The two adventures can be played independently of each other or can be connected to form a larger dungeon.\nAbout Gavin: Gavin is the creator of Old-School Essentials, creator of the Dolmenwood campaign setting, and author of critically acclaimed, weird fairy tale-esque adventures (Winter's Daughter, The Hole in the Oak).\n Holy Mountain Shaker, by Luka Rejec [Unlocked \u2014 $70,000]\nBackers will have the option of selecting this adventure as an add-on in the pledge manager at a special, reduced price of $10 (MSRP $15).\nAbout the adventure: The earth shakes. Trees sway like grass before the hungry wind. Again. Chimneys fall like childrens' toys in the streets of Doll Town. Again. The capstone of the tomb of the first folk tumbles and breaks. The divine carp beneath the sacred mountain is angry. The town needs heroes. Brave souls to enter the deep places, the abandoned temples, the lightless waters at the roots of the mountains. Holy fools to appease the wonder fish. Is service to the community not draw enough? The townsfolk wag eyebrows and mutter and complain. Then admit. There are old treasures there, too. Glittery scales of gold and adamant, yes. But also doors to the other worlds, where demons of disease may be banished, whence lost friends may be retrieved from death's dusty grasp.\nAbout Luka: Luka is an artist and writer, probably best known for the ENnie-winning Ultraviolet Grasslands, though he would prefer to be better known for the apocryphal adventures of Pointyhelmet and Poncho.\n Isle of the Plangent Mage, by Donn Stroud [Unlocked \u2014 $80,000]\nBackers will have the option of selecting this adventure as an add-on in the pledge manager at a special, reduced price of $10 (MSRP $15).\nAbout the adventure: Isle of the Plangent Mage takes players to multiple locations above and below the ocean. Areas worth exploring include a hidden cove, an old rickety lighthouse, a small fishing village, a weird island, and a mysterious lair that plunges the to depths of the underwater world. Ultrasonic magics, strange aural puzzles, monstrosities from the deep, suspicious villagers, and beached whales all stand between discovering the truth behind the dealings and the demise of the Plangent Mage.\nAbout Donn: Donn began his public gaming persona when he concocted and launched (with co-host Adam Muszkiewicz) Drink Spin Run: The RPG Talkshow Podcast. After talking to RPG writers, designers, and other creatives, he decided to move from podcasting to writing and publishing his own material. \nFree PDF: Spell Trackers [Unlocked \u2014 $110,000]\nWe\u2019ll produce a PDF with four spell trackers \u2014 one for each type of spells (cleric, druid, illusionist, magic-user) \u2014 allowing players to easily keep track of the spells their character has memorized.

Gavin has driven the Old-School Essentials project since its inception, and is the mastermind behind the writing, layout, and art direction. Gavin's adventure Winter's Daughter was nominated for two ENnie awards in 2019.\n Donn Stroud: Co-host of the infamous Drink, Spin, Run podcast. Donn's adventure Dead Planet won an ENnie in 2019 and his adventure A Pound of Flesh won another ENnie in 2020.\n Luka Rejec: Luka's magnum opus psychedelic metal campaign setting, The Ultraviolet Grasslands, won two ENnie awards in 2020.\n Diogo Nogueira: Renowned creator of the platinum selling old-school RPGs Sharp Swords & Sinister Spells and Solar Blades & Cosmic Spells (along with many, many other games!).\n Frederick M\u00fcnch: The coding maestro behind the Old-School Essentials SRD and generator website!\n Peter Mullen: Revered for his fantastically imaginative work on the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG and many other old-school games, Peter's paintings grace the front of the Advanced Fantasy Player's Tome and Referee's Tome! \n Andrew Walter: Beloved creator of the wondrous covers of the Old-School Essentials Classic Fantasy game, two new pieces by Andrew are featured on the collector's edition Player's Tome and Referee's Tome.\n Stefan Poag: Esteemed creator of weird and wonderful fantasy art, including many pieces for the Mutant Crawl Classics RPG, Metamorphosis Alpha, and many others.

We're renowned for our communicative and open development process, so you can be sure of receiving a steady stream of updates as the project progresses.\n\nThe risks involved in this project are low. The text of the Advanced Fantasy books is 100% finished. The layout is done. The cover art is done. About 50% of the interior illustrations are in place. All that remains, development-wise, is for the artists to get working on the final illustrations, to be slotted into the layout.\n\nWe've previously worked (on very large projects!) with the printer who'll be manufacturing the books, so their professionalism and commitment to high quality are known factors. They do excellent work, fast and don't bat an eyelid when we tell them we need to print 30,000 books.\n\nAs for the stretch goals, we've been careful to not get carried away adding loads of extra content which could risk decimating the project timelines. The physical upgrades to the books don't entail any additional development time (they just cost extra!). The adventure scenarios obviously require additional print production but this work has already been factored into the planned shipping dates, so the risk is minimal. The authors, illustrators, editors, and layout folks involved are all professionals whom we've worked with before and can rely on.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental

It has all of the personality of our original ADV3NTURE Hoodie, which is the most funded hoodie ever on Kickstarter. But this one is better made, has a 5-year guarantee, and this guy's made right here in America! \nWe're back with TWO NEW HOODIES that are All-American. At ADV3NTURE, we launch our new products on Kickstarter because we love the community that we have built through crowdfunding. With the success our brand has experienced, we're back with hoodies that are more stylish, more comfortable, and have improvements to people's favorite innovations.\nTHE ADV3NTURE HOODIE and THE CLASSIC HOODIE are hand-crafted in America, from the ground up. It all starts with American cotton grown in North Carolina, zippers made in Georgia, and the final product being cut and sewn in California. Our new hoodies (and as of 2020, ALL of our  products) are made by hard-working Americans, like you.\nOur ADV3NTURE Hoodie brings back everyone's favorite features and innovations in a more refined and durable version of our original hoodie. It's designed to be your favorite everyday hoodie with comfort, stylishness and quality at the forefront. It has innovative construction elements, like a three-panel hood, over-locking seams, and our proprietary French terry loop fabric.\nOur CLASSIC Hoodie has the same silhouette as the new ADV3NTURE Hoodie, including the comfort, durability, and construction. We removed some of the innovations of from the ADV3NTURE hoodie. What we ended up with was a stylish, premium hoodie with just the right number of features and enough colors for every day of the week!\n The ADV3NTURE Hoodie and the CLASSIC Hoodie have the same dimensions and measurements and are made with the same fabric and materials. Below is a comparison of their features.\nWe are offering the ADV3NTURE and CLASSIC hoodies in EIGHT colors. There are no stretch goals, where we need to raise a certain amount in this campaign before they become available. ALL colors, named after California landmarks, are available once the campaign reaches its funding goal. At the end of the campaign, you will be emailed a survey (to the email associated with your Kickstarter account) where you'll tell us the color(s) and size(s) that you'd like us to send you.\nIf you'd like to add additional hoodies to your pledge once the campaign is over, you can do so easily in your survey. \nOur Catalina hoodie was inspired by the blue waters around Santa Catalina, an island off the coast of Los Angeles. One of California\u2019s Channel Islands, it's known for its wildlife, dive sites and Mt. Orizaba, its highest peak.\nOur Humboldt green hood was inspired by the green hills of Humboldt county, 270 miles north of San Francisco. Humboldt County is a densely forested region with nearly 1,500,000 acres of forest land and contains dozens of national, state, and local parks. They are also know for a particular green crop, but that had nothing to do with the name... we promise.\nOur Mojave color was inspired by the sands of Mojave National Preserve, the third largest of the America's National Parks. Singing sand dunes, cinder cone volcanoes, and a large Joshua tree forest are found within this 1.6-million-acre park. A visit to its canyons, mountains, and mesas will reveal long-abandoned mines, homesteads,  rock-walled military outposts, and an abandoned train depot.\nThis color was inspired by the wines of the Napa Valley, widely considered one of the top wine regions in the US. Visiting one of the valley's wineries every day would take over a year! More than four hundred wineries and grows many different grape varieties including Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Merlot, Zinfandel, and other popular varietals.\nRising nearly 5,000 feet above Yosemite Valley and 8,800 feet above sea level, Half Dome is a Yosemite icon. This hoodie is a tribute to this impressive natural monument. Considered to be unclimbable in 1865, Half Dome was first summitted in 1875. The south face of Half Dome is now \"conquered\" by thousand of people every year.\nThis color was inspired by California's Lassen Volcanic National Park, home to steaming fumaroles, meadows freckled with wildflowers, clear mountain lakes, and numerous volcanoes. Jagged peaks tell the story of its eruptive past while hot water continues to shape the land. Lassen Volcanic offers opportunities to discover the wonder and mysteries of volcanoes and hot water for visitors willing to explore the undiscovered.\nThis hoodie is a tribute to the US Navy, which has a strong presence in California, and all branches of the military. Cheers to all of the brave men and women who risk their lives to protect our way of life! For all serving, and who have served, we greatly appreciate your service and sacrifice.\nThis hoodie is a tribute to Black Rock, a lava rock outcropping at the north end of Ka'anapali Beach. The Hawai\u2019ian name for Black Rock is Pu\u2019u Keka\u2019a, and ancient Hawaiians believed that this was the place where their spirits went to jump off to join ancestors forever. This color is also a nod to our friends at Maui Brewing Company, who have been supporters of Adv3nure since the beginning. We can't wait to have a beer with you soon! \nWe have always taken pride creating thoughtful innovations into our garments. Over the years, we have been refining and perfecting the features of our hoodies to make them streamlined and subtle. You'll find some of your favorite features in the descriptions below, as well as some of our developments in manufacturing, which make these hoodies better than any we have made.\nOur signature Beverage Pocket holds your drink, so you can keep your hands free to do other things. Hold your coffee while you walk to the dog and talk on the phone. Hold your beer while you hold your plate and a fork. Hold a baby bottle while you hold your baby. We're SURE you'll find plenty of uses for this pocket! \nOur Thumb-Hole Mitts have been a favorite feature of the ADV3NTURE Hoodie since the beginning! Unfold the cuffs to reveal the thumb-holes and enough material to keep your hands warm. Whether you use them as drinking gloves (to keep your beverage from warming up in your hands) or to keep your hands warm as the temperature drops, try them once and you'll be hooked!  \nBoth of our hoodies convert into pillows, a feature we find constantly useful. Simply roll them up into the Three-Panel Hood, which has been designed for the pillow conversion. Whether you're a passenger on a long car ride or want a place to rest your head while camping, the pillow conversion will be more convenient than you can imagine.\nThe Three-Panel Hood has been design to more comfortably fit your head. Rather than a one-piece hood where the fabric is bunched to create the shape of your melon, our three-panel hood uses three components to create an incredibly comfortable head covering.\nThe Passport Pocket lets you keep your valuable, like money, your ID, phone, or your passport close to your chest. The ZigZag stitching around the pocket holds the interior pocket in place, so the contents of your pocket stay secure.\nThe split Kangaroo Pockets are held in place by over-lock stitching and bar-tack reinforced edges to ensure their durability. The openings of the pockets are angled for maximum comfort as they hold your hands and keep them warm. \nInside the right kangaroo pocket is a hidden pocket inside to secure your valuable, like your keys, so they don't fall out while you're adventuring. It will give you extra confidence when carrying items around in your pockets. \nMost independent craft breweries (which we're fans of) are canning beer rather than bottling it, but as a throwback to the bottle-openers that we used to include in our hoodies and jackets, we're including this canvas bottle-opener PATCH (similar to the ones in our flannels), so you can twist off your bottle caps without damaging the French terry loop fabric. \n All of the zippers on the new hoodies are metal YKK zippers, the most durable, high-quality zippers available. And, they're made right here in the USA. This includes the main zipper on the ADV3NTURE and CLASSIC hoodies, as well as the zippers on the beverage pocket and passport pocket. \n We've added Elbow Pads to the arms of the ADV3NTURE Hoodie for added comfort, as well as to reduce wear on the area where your hoodie will come into contact with hard surfaces. They also add a bit of style to your hoodie, so people know you mean business. \n It's not quite as complicated as a GPS tracker, but our return home tag, and the honesty of a good samaritan should get your hoodie back to you if you happen to leave it on one of your adventures. It also contains our pledge to plant three trees with every purchase, including the hoodie you receive from this campaign.\nHere's a closer look!\n We've made sure that all of the stitching used in our hoodies keep your hoodie intact during your adventures. We use over-lock stitching on the top of the shoulders, so they lay flat, to make the seams comfortable if you happen to be wearing a backpack. \nWe\u2019ve spent nine months developing a unique fabric that we love. It\u2019s a high-density French terry fabric blend that is the best overall weight, and retains the its shape (being nearly shrink resistant), maintains durability, and is the optimal softness. \nOur hoodies start with raw cotton grown in North Carolina, where it is combed and spun in a yarn mill. The yarn is then transported to Los Angeles, where the yarns are knitted into our proprietary French terry loop. The fabric is then sent to our dye house, where the fabric blend achieves its subtle heathered appearance. It is then pre-washed (pre-shrunk) in our manufacturing facility. At that point, the fabric is inspected for any imperfections from the knitting or dying process. Once the fabric passes inspection, it is then ready to be cut and sewn into your new hoodie.\nKeeping our manufacturing domestic enables us ensure the highest quality of raw materials that are sourced for production, while allowing us to oversee the entire process to ensure high production standards through the entire process. We are also able to ensure that our high environmental standards are being maintained.\nHand-crafting our products domestically lets us keep jobs in the US, especially in a time where they\u2019re needed most. We are incredibly proud that all of our apparel is made by hard-working Americans.     \nBeing an environmentally conscious brand means we understand the importance of the environment and our affect on it. We are actively taking steps to reduce our carbon footprint by utilizing domestic raw materials and planting three trees to offset our environmental impact.\nThe \"3\" in our name represents the three trees that we plant with every purchase, including this Kickstarter campaign.\nTo find the size that best suits you, take your favorite hoodie and lay it on a flat surface. Compare the measurements of your hoodie with the measurements below. If washed properly (was cold and lay flat to dry) your hoodie should not shrink more than 1-2%. The polyester woven into the fabric maintains shape retention.\nIn addition to the standard sizes XS-2XL, we are offering BIG & TALL sizes. This includes TALL sizes in Large and X-Large, as well as 3X-5XL. These sizes require new patterns to be created, as well as extra fabric in the manufacturing, and extra shipping charges, due to the additional weight. If you order a BIG & TALL size, you will have to pay an additional charge when you receive your survey. Those ordering TALL sizes will be required to pay an additional $10. Those ordering 3X-5XL will be required to pay an additional $15.\nThe additional shipping charges added to your pledge for international orders does not include duties, taxes, customs VAT, or any other fees that may be charged by your country. Unfortunately, there are too many variables for us to properly calculate any additional charges. We are sorry for any inconvenience.\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarter launches with 1,400+ successful Kickstarter projects and over $500M raised in total.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis isn\u2019t our first rodeo.

We have an amazing customer service and fulfillment team. Shoot us an email (info@adv3nture.com) and we\u2019d love to answer your questions! We pride ourselves on open communication and thrive with input from our community. Please don\u2019t ever hesitate to reach out if you feel there is something we could be doing better! \n\nPlease note that it is VERY important that you fill out your survey as soon as you receive it. 1-2 days after the campaign is concluded, you will be emailed a link to a Kickstarter survey. If you don\u2019t, check your junk email folder or email us as we\u2019ll get it sorted out. In your survey, you\u2019ll provide us with your color choices(s), size(s) and address, so we know WHAT to send you and WHERE to send it. At the conclusion of the campaign, once the surveys are collected, we will be placing the order with our manufacturer. At that point, it takes about 60 days for the hoodies to be manufactured and mailed to you.\n\nWe have done this before and learned from the many challenges that we have encountered. We are confident that we will deliver these hoodies on time. Please be aware that if we are sending your hoodie(s) internationally, we will not be able to prepay the duties for international shipments, so you will be responsible for covering those charges.

All that and a mini-adventure that\u2019s not-so-mini in Jim Wampler\u2019s The Gene Looms of Janeck-Vacca. \nBehold just a few of the tantalizing delights in SCIENTIFIC BARBARIAN #1!\nAll That, Plus Regular Features\nSCIENTIFIC BARBARIAN #1 also includes ongoing features that will continue in every issue, with new mutations, new monsters, new artifacts, Retro Reviews of inspirational source media and material, and of course Scientific Comics right in the back!\nNot Just For the Radioactive at Heart\nSure, all this great new gaming material has been designed with the discriminating post-apocalyptic gamer in mind, but it is also eminently suitable for fantasy games \u2014 especially if your campaign needs a fresh jolt of excitement. In both the pulp literature that inspired our hobby and in the fantasy games of yore, many a magic item or monster turned out to have scientific origins. The contents of SCIENTIFIC BARBARIAN are ideal for getting seen-it-all done-it-all fantasy players back on their toes and engaged with new surprises. All material presented is useable with any d20-based game system.\nManifest of Wonders\nSCIENTIFIC BARBARIAN #1 will be a 6\u201d x 9\u201d digest-size square-bound book so it will look great on your shelf or slip easily into your game bag. Survey the table of contents for issue #1!\nHow to Pledge for Multiple Copies\nNeed to pledge for multiple copies of SCIENTIFIC BARBARIAN #1? Just select the pledge level for the PRINT + PDF and fill out the dollar amount in multiples of $15 (i.e., $30 for two copies, $45 for three copies, etc).\nRetailer Pledge Level\nEspecially in these trying times, we support all our brick-and-mortar game stores. If you are a retailer and wish to pledge at the Retailer Pledge Level, all we ask is that you send us verification via email or messages after pledging.\nShipping Costs\nEach book will be shipped to backers USPS First Class in a sturdy cardboard envelope. Per Kickstarter recommendations, shipping and handling costs ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE PLEDGE LEVELS. Shipping and handling is an economical $5 per book shipped. Retailer shipping will be via Media Mail and is also only $5.\nAll shipping for this Kickstarter is to the USA ONLY, so please pledge accordingly. Current International shipping costs are so high that shipping outside the USA is not feasible for Mudpuppy Games at this time. We know that sucks, but much larger companies with better resources than us have struggled with this and failed. Plus we just can\u2019t bring ourselves to charge shipping costs in excess of the price of the product itself, and for that philosophy we can only apologize in advance.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nThere aren\u2019t any! We\u2019re not fooling around here. The entirety of funds raised for this project are being devoted to creating one of the best new gaming zines around. They say \u201cContent is King\u201d, and that axiom is our guiding principle at SCIENTIFIC BARBARIAN.\nADD-ONS\nDid you miss out on any of our prior projects? We got you. To add-on any of the following items, just increase your pledge level dollars by the amounts listed below, then when your backer survey comes at the end of the kickstarter note which items you want in the add-on question/text field.\nYou can add-on any of our last three successful kickstarter projects.\nThe shipping costs for add-ons depends on how many books you add. Up to three books total (including your print copy of SCIENTIFIC BARBARIAN #1) can be shipped at a combined cost of $5. More than 3 books total have a combined cost of $7. Any reward with multiple books added on will be shipped Media Mail. Because of the differences between First Class and Media Mail, the MHH dice set do require an additional $5 shipping and handling charge if added on.\nCheck This Artifact ($15)\nCheck This Artifact contains 30 brand-new artifacts of the Ancient Makers, plus a full write up of a new godlike AI and its neural programs (spells), all for use in any d20-based post-apocalyptic role playing game or genre-mash fantasy role playing game.\nDigest 6\u201d x 9\u201d softcover, 60 pages\nFight This Mutant ($20)\nFight This Mutant contains over 30 brand-new mutant monsters and races, a whole new Ancient Alliance your player characters can join or fight, a brand-new character class \u2014 the Technomancer, and 15 new neural programs (spells) from 1st through 5th levels. Usable in any d20-based post-apocalyptic or genre-mash fantasy role playing game.\nDigest 6\u201d x 9\u201d softcover, 120 pages\nMutant Murder Hobo Dice ($15 + $5 shipping)\nMutant Murder Hobo Dice set includes 4 glow-in-the-dark d20s, each in a different color: Uranium (green-white), Plutonium (purple), Cobalt-60 (blue), and Thorium-G (orange) all light-shielded in a plush black velvet dice bag with embroidered MMH logo in gold. Show the whole world that you\u2019re here to kick ass and chew radium\u2026 and you\u2019re all out of radium!\nAbout Mudpuppy Games\nMudpuppy Games is the personal game publishing label of game designer, writer, and artist Jim Wampler.

Every challenge meaning death, or something worse. It is there she found THE SCRIPTURES OF THE WORM: promising power eternal and the bond of the Grub. She followed them to what we now call her Throne; this stronghold is the only thing between humanity and the scourge of the Doombringer Moth.\u201d -- Some future historian on the God-Queen\nRUN! RUN! RUN! (and grab your pig)\nWhat is 2 WORM 2 FURIOUS?\nA deadly funnel that revolves around an ever mutating and evolving moth grub. You\u2019ll want 4-6 players, 15-20 level 0 characters, as it\u2019s a funnel, but it works for levels 1+ (the worm adapts; don\u2019t worry). \nTHE grub has escaped and you have been charged by the God-Queen to bring it back to the hatchery, but this is a funnel after all\u2026 so stuff will inevitably go wrong and will likely be fatal.\nThe worm grows and grows and grows and grows. The growth unlocks new abilities for the worm grub, ranging from taking a snooze, to spraying caustic acid.\nIts mutations don\u2019t stop until it cocoons and becomes the Doombringer Moth. Scales will fall from its hallowed wings, and the god rays will immolate the kingdom.\nIt will be an A5 Hardcover with Art by Scrap Princess! (over a dozen pieces!). It is currently hovering around 68 pages before layout and final editing.\nAs a player you\u2019ll be trying to get the Worm / Grub / Juvenile Moth back to the hatchery. You will likely die, be sacrificed to the worm, fall into a sinkhole, or be trampled\u2026 because it\u2019s a funnel.\nAs a Judge you\u2019ll be harnessing the raw power of the grub as it mutates, and changes forms\u2026 until it becomes the kingdom shattering Doombringer Moth (unless the players stop it first). You also have access to the royal guard, the knightly orders, the worm-locks and worm-hawks, as well as some encounters.\nIt is also a setting that you could easily hack this into your own settings and games. Add the worm anywhere, use the God-Queen as an npc, or modify your fighter classes to be like the Knights and Sky Knights. Or just pull out the worm-hawks for use as mounts for your home game.\na quick mockup render via Glynn @ MonkeyBloodDesign\nWhat is Dungeon Crawl Classics?\nDungeon Crawl Classics is a roleplaying game designed and published by Goodman games. It's a combination of classic Appendix N (Conan, Solomon Kane, Lovecraft) goodness, alongside all the things you'd expect in other classic roleplaying games. It has a heavy emphasis on Sword and Sorcery, and you're just as likely to be casting spells and watching your body mutate, as you are to knock a cyclops off a cliff to dam a river. (or in this case, being fed to a burgeoning worm deity)\nAnd even if you don\u2019t play (or own) DCC, it still has HD, and AC and stuff you\u2019d find in other OSR, and D20 systems! (it would also work for a certain fifth edition game; it definitely would) \nthe grub that grew up\nSo what\u2019s inside?\n A Funnel: this is how adventurers are forged. Just bring the grub home, how hard could it be?\n Locations: be it a Tavern, cemetery, farm, or temple.\n Encounters: worm-hawks, rioting villagers, and sinkholes.\n The Worm: how it grows and mutates; acts and reacts. The effects it has on the populace around it.\n New Occupations: barge tenders, swamp witches, scribes, butchers, and more.\nNew Bestiary Entries\n The Villager: pitchforks and scorn\n Knights of the Forgotten Silk: Warhammer wielding devotees to the grubs; they cast nets to snare their prey. In death they leave a surprise.\n Worm-Locks: guardians of the grub that take vile trophies and read the word of the worm.\n Sky-Knights of the inverted grub: the god-queen\u2019s royal guard; they patrol the skies on their steeds, leaping to the ground to finish whats their javelins don\u2019t.\n Worm-Hawks: ospreys? Pangolins? What are they? Ravenous \u201cbirds\u201d with 20 foot wingspans. They feast on worm flesh.\n Bandits & Stilt-Walkers: Need to have something to keep your eye on in the village. Why not a spectacle?\nSome important NPCS\n Serena, The God-Queen: SHE who commands this kingdom.\n Eirny Just, Tavern Owner: a retired sky-knight that would rather see the god-Queen dead.\n Pangolust XVIII, ????: worm-hawk breeder that believes herself to be the only one that the god-queen needs.\n Selenium Gellar, \u201cThe Jester\u201d: serves as the eyes of the moth-bound; they will rise again.\nMoth Clerics or are they Worm-Locks? I don't know\nNew Patron or Deity?\n Invoke Patron: create dust holograms, make all you gaze upon fall asleep, and harness the god lights.\n Spellburn: runes begin to burn, and your fingers turn to nails.\n Patron Taint: become as a moth, and watch your body deform.\n New Canticles: apply runes to friends as mana batteries and call down sub-orbital lasers.\n New Divine Favors: ever want to cocoon yourself? or sprout wings?\n New Portents of the Worm-God: grubs bursting from the seams, teeth falling out, clouds of moths\u2026 you know the usual.\nOther Stuff?\nDid we say magical rune-marks?\nA Worm Tracker (handy reference for the die chain)\nLedgers to keep track of people and kingdoms crushed by the grub-god\nWe've also tried to add as many tables as possible; as DCC intended.\nThe Cocoon\nWho are we?\nOrbital Intelligence is designer, producer, and publisher of tabletop game content, based out of Seattle, WA.

As far as any of the regional layfolk are concerned, they live on the edge of the world, and all manner of horrors spawn in the shadow of the mountains beyond. There was a time when the people of Stennard may have traveled further west, closer to the rising rock face, but any roads that once were have long since been taken back by nature, with nothing more than deer paths remaining.\nThe growing season in this region has seen a glut of torrential rains that have damaged and spoiled the crops. This outlier town has few trading partners, and the neighboring towns are suffering the same fate. The townsfolk need to do something to ensure their citizenry have enough in their stores to survive the coming winter. A small band of Stennard\u2019s most prolific hunters and gatherers agreed to press into the forbidden lands to the west and did not return. Desperate, a call was sent out to all of the neighboring towns: \u201cCome to Stennard! We are offering a reward to find our missing sons and daughters.\u201d\nCover layout may differ slightly from what is pictured. Cover art by Matt Stikker.\nA 0-Level Funnel for DCC RPG\nThis dungeon adventure was designed to be run as a 0-level \"funnel\" for DCC RPG. For those unfamiliar with the concept, each player starts with three or four 0-level peasants who must survive on their wits alone, because they have not yet blossomed into full adventurers with skills and abilities. At the end of the adventure, each player may have one or two survivors who become the adventurers they were destined to be! This adventure plays best with 12-16 0-level characters. (Note: If you play one of the many OSR systems available, you can easily port this over for 5-8 1st level characters.)\nThe Goal\nWe feel we are almost ready to send this project to the printer. The writing is just about complete and it could use a couple more passes of editing. We've spent the last two years curating interior art from Rich Sampson (@artofnerdgore), Mike Tommyrot (@miketommyrot), Sam Alcarez (@samalcarez), and cover art from Matt Stikker (@bargainbinblasphemy). We'd like to fill it out with a few more pieces and we'd like to procure higher quality cartography if possible, but most importantly, we'd like to get this adventure into the hands of DCC RPG fans everywhere.\nLeft to right: Matt Stikker (@bargainbinblasphemy), Sam Alcarez (@samalcarez), Rich Sampson (@artofnerdgore), Mike Tommyrot (@miketommyrot)\nTwo Years of Play Testing\nOver the last two years the adventure has been run over a dozen times across various conventions such as Cyclops Con (2020), Midwinter (2019 & 2020), Dan's Con of the Vale (2019), AdeptiCon (2019) and events additional events at Board Game Barrister and Noble Knight Games (Free RPG Day 2019) by myself and local hero, Jim Meyers. With each play through the content has been tweaked and revised. Though there have been no TPK's (total party kills), the character pool has proven to be suitably funneled down to a handful of characters consistently. \nAdditionally, though it plays well in a convention environment, it is an introductory adventure that introduces a number villains who may survive making a great launching point for a campaign.\nAdventure Highlights\nThis adventure has eight named NPCs with stats, descriptions, personality traits, and motivations. The Introductory scene has 20 possible rumors and opinions  for an inquisitive party to gather information from. Split into three acts, the adventure has over 20 potential scenes and encounter areas to explore, combining wilderness set pieces and dungeon encounters.  \nSample images from Rabid Dogs Zine.\nThe Precipice of Corruption and Rabid Dogs Zine\nDuring Zine Quest 2 we funded Rabid Dogs Zine, a 32 page zine full of rules I use at my own table. Rabid Dogs Zine is a 8.5\"x5.5\" sized DCC compatible fanzine with a new occupation table, rules for using any traditional character race in combination with any class, two new character classes, the Outlier and the Canine. and for Judges, two Roadside Encounters, with one that is directly connected to the story line of The Precipice of Corruption. \nWhy DCC?\nI started playing D&D in 1981 with the Tom Moldvay Basic Set and B2 Keep on the Borderlands. I lived and breathed D&D, AD&D, and 2nd Edition AD&D for over a decade, but I discovered miniature wargaming in the mid 90s and somehow I lost interest in RPGs for the next 15 years. Then something happened. I got the itch again for a half dozen people to crowd around a table to share in a story together. I dabbled in Warhammer Fantasy Role-Play, Pathfinder, Call of Cthulhu, and even 5th Edition D&D. None of these systems gave me the experience I was looking for. Enter DCC...\nIt's 2018 and I discover a system that touted itself as \"D&D like it's 1974 again...\" and the aesthetic just called out to me. Later that year I was gifted the full rule book and it unlocked the neural pathways I had of memories from when I first fell in love with D&D in 3rd grade. Over the next month I wrote the first draft of this project and ran it for some of my close friends and they seemed to really enjoy it. Bolstered by their enthusiasm, we took it to the streets!\n What is Dungeon Crawl Classics? \nGlory & Gold Won by Sorcery & Sword\nYou\u2019re no hero.\nYou\u2019re an adventurer: a reaver, a cutpurse, a heathen-slayer, a tight-lipped warlock guarding long-dead secrets.

They left their tools and programs scattered throughout the vast network. Some have been found by seekers such as yourself and have been passed down from generation to generation. Collectively these independent pieces of software are known as Enchiridion of the Computarchs. \nK.J. O'Brien\nEnchiridion of the Computarchs gives a judge the leg up on developing and using casting mechanics and concepts in high-tech settings. This book encompasses a range of material concerning computers and programs that a \u201ctechno-caster\u201d (like the MCC shaman class, or those classes found in Cyber Sprawl Classics, Crawljammer, Umerica, Terror of the Stratosfiend, and Star Crawl) can utilize. Depending on how you want to play DCC RPG Empire of the East or DCC RPG Dying Earth, this book could be used in those settings as well. You will find a collection of spells (aka, programs) in this book, a d24 spellburn table, new mechanics for spell failure, and a brief corruption table all couched in a high-technobabble style for your post-apocalyptic, far-future, and dystopian-future campaigns.\nBook Specifications\nOfficially licensed DCC & MCC third party product.\nPledge rewards are at a discounted price.\n8.5\" x 11\" supplement, ~100 pages, back & white interior, color cover.\nPlenty of art.

This campaign is going to go very light on stretch goals, because I want to present the complete book rather than dancing around and celebrating stretch goals.\n However, there are some additions to make if we meet certain funding goals:\n $1,500 - If the project funds, I'll open up a crowdsource file for submitting mercurial effects to include in the book. The section will be called Program Provenance and will give a bit of a backstory and mercurial effects to the user's programs. A little taste of the G+ days when we used to set a topic and throw a bunch of ideas in the stew pot. I'll edit and add to the submitted ideas until we have a full list of 80. This idea is subject to participation. If there are none or very few submissions, I may abandon the effort. \n $5,000 - ICE (Intrusion Countermeasures Electronic) Generator. An additional appendix to help flesh out the monsters and guardians of the meta-verse.\n $6,000 - Kickstarter only printing on 70 lb. paper (standard color in OBS). This option will not be available with the future DriveThruRPG POD release.\nMatt Sutton\nProject Status\nThe writing is 100% finished and layout is 90% complete. Artists are being lined-up for commissions and about a third of the art is already done. The focus is on a finished project, rather than a dynamic product based on backer support. This will allow us to get it into your hands fast.\nWhy?\nI've been working on this project on and off since Mutant Crawl Classics RPG came into our lives. I wanted a little something extra for shamans than what was in the book and I figure others might too. Joseph Goodman has been extremely supportive of this project.\nThat said, most of the programs are re-skins of DCC RPG spells. There are 4 new programs in the book and around 10 of the re-skins were substantial face-lifts. Mechanics borrow from DCC RPG in places, but there is a fair amount of new mechanics and some generation tables. This book is not novel, revolutionary, or even particularly necessary for the DIY judge. Download a free preview from DriveThruRPG and judge for yourself whether the full book will find some use at your table.\nI am planning for OBS for printing and fulfillment; that will keep shipping costs down for international backers. Except Canada. Printer for North America is in the USA and you pay first class international. Sorry Canada. I loved the prints from Mixam, but costs are high right now and OBS allows me to offer you the choice between soft and hard cover to control what you can spend.\nSince we're not doing a ton of stretch goals and as a way of saying thanks for the early support, Enchiridion of the Computarchs is being offered at a price below the MSRP.

Thanks to its unique encounter system featuring exponential growth, it's suitable for player characters of any level. The story allows you to explore a new setting (the land of Valdir), inhabited by variety of original creatures and obstacles for the players to overcome. The book itself (a tome of more than 350 pages long, illustrated in full color) contains the sandboxy campaign, but also a complete bestiary (including printable monster tokens) and an overview of the setting - but rather than reading about the setting, I want you to experience it first-hand! This can only be accomplished by playing through the campaign and uncovering the secrets of Valdir as you go along.\nUp until a century ago, the land of Valdir was inhabited by humans, ruled by four powerful wizards. Then one night, all human life vanished from the face of Valdir without a trace. To this day, no one knows what happened or what made them abandom the world they built, but it was the wizards' servants who were left behind to fend for themselves. Four species of familiar -beasts, undead, constructs and fey- inherited the ruins of Valdir's once-great civilization. New strife erupted to fill the power gap the wizards had left in their absence, and several powerful factions emerged among their former familiars. When a summoning ritual goes awry, an external influence is unleashed upon Valdir for the first time in a hundred years, in the form of the player characters. They will have to navigate ancient ruins and enchanted locations as well as the political battlefield to eventually decide the fate of Valdir in this open-ended story that goes beyond good and evil. YOUR choices will have a lasting impact on the future of Valdir!\nUnfamiliar isn't just a setting, a bestiary or a set of adventure hooks. It's a complete adventure campaign set in an original world with an alien look and feel, unlike anything you've ever encountered before. The book is divided into fourteen chapters, each a complete adventure module in itself based on locations in Valdir. The player characters choose where they'll go while exploring the strange lands surrounding them, and depending on where their trail  leads them, you simply run the appropriate chapter. The chapters are interlinked by four possible metaplots that make up the overarching story and reach their conclusion in one of four different endings; it's up to the players to decide which route their characters take, which bait to take, and which alliances to form in order to get the upper hand and create their very own custom-built story as they go along.\nApart from that, this game utilizes a unique system of exponentional growth where encounters are concerned. Instead of going where the level-appropriate monsters are, encounter difficulty will adapt to match the experience level of your party. As such, this campaign is playable with characters of any level. You have that one character you've been aching to play again appear in Valdir, or start anew with a party of level-one characters. Anything is possible as the story adapts itself to your needs!\n\nWhat happened to the humans of Valdir? How will the different species of familiar react to the changes the players bring?  Will the PCs step forward as noble freedom-fighters or as opportunists who ally themselves with the most powerful faction? Or maybe they just want to get back home? Anything is possible in this huge adventure campaign that'll have you plotting and scheming as well as exploring and uncovering secrets for years on end. But don't take my word for it - here's an excerpt from the book's introduction to give you some more information on what it's all about:  Unfamiliar.pdf \nIn exchange for your generous pledge, you'll get a full-color, beautifully illustrated, hardcover book, more than 350 pages long. The adventure campaign within should have you exploring the land of Valdir for years on end! You'll also get a set of printable monster tokens, as the creatures of this mythic land differ significantly from what you're used to. And did I mention that shipping is absolutely free worldwide?\n\n...And as we're feeling exceptionally charitable today, 5 % of all the funds raised by this Kickstarter campaign will go to Castle Critical, a non-profit organisation here in Belgium that brings role-playing games to children's hospitals.

I'm using Dungeonfog for it, which works great, but I've noticed it takes a long time to design a map!

When the plans of the Gamemaster meet the actions of the characters, the incredible creative energy that results can spin encounters off in different directions, creating a largely spontaneous campaign story that keeps the GM and the players alike on the edge of their seats. But when it comes to the climactic boss battle encounters that cap off single adventures or entire campaigns, it\u2019s often much harder for GMs to work things out on the fly.\nThat\u2019s where this book comes in. \nFantastic Lairs cover art by Jack Kaiser\nScott Gray, James Introcaso, and Mike Shea have teamed up to lighten the load of shaping and developing your game\u2019s climactic encounters. Fantastic Lairs is a book of capstone lair encounters for your 5e fantasy RPG, designed to inspire and fit into your own campaign. Each fantastic lair includes evocative artwork, a beautiful full-color map, and a well-designed and playtested boss encounter for characters of various levels.\nCheck out the free sample, which includes two fantastic lairs you can use right now! We're also releasing virtual tabletop-ready maps for these two lairs so you can run them easily online.\nThe initial campaign goal for this book includes lairs for 1st- through 10th-level characters, each of which includes instructions for scaling it for different levels of play. After breaking through five stretch goals, we will now add lairs for 11th- through 20th-level play. The book will now include twenty lairs for all four tiers of play. \nFantastic Lairs is the joint brainchild of all three members of the design team, each of whom brings a wealth of creative skill and experience to the project. From over fifty initial concepts, the team narrowed down a selection of twenty ultimate boss lairs for development in this book.\nYour support for this project will fund the design, development, editing, artwork, and cartography that will make this book a reality. The more support we receive, the better the book will be. \nInternal view of Caves of the Cockatrice (Illustration by Allie Briggs)\nThe Lairs\nThanks to our backers' outstanding support we will have the following twenty lairs in this book.\nLair of the Cockatrice (1st Level). A shadow-infused cockatrice keeps a stone garden in a lair built around an ancient and corrupted fey gateway.\nCentipede Cultists (Tier 1). A band of centipede-worshipping cultists feed living sacrifices to their pets in a fallen temple of Asmodeus.\nNevermind (Tier 1). The Dead Roses, a band of cutthroats led by the murderous bandit captain Adilia Rose, hide out between jobs in a seedy tavern built from a titan's skull.\nLord Whiskers (Tier 1). A band of wererats led by the megalomaniacal Lord Whiskers gathers up all the city's silver to be destroyed in their trap-infested sewer lair.\nNature's Rage (Tier 1). A blood-drenched druid and a horde of beasts plot revenge against the despoilers of nature in the ruined zoo of a murdered noble.\nThe Fiery Belly of the Beast (Tier 2). The half-dragon Tharandra Everflame and her kobold minions steer a machine of war and fire through defenseless villages.\nThe Lamia Job (Tier 2). The characters must infiltrate a mysterious bank vault to reveal the murderous plots and corrupting illusions of a lamia mastermind.\nThe Blood Palace (Tier 2). In a lost ziggurat of blood, a sinister spirit naga and its enthralled gnolls need the adventurers' help \u2014 to feed their hidden hydra.\nSticky Toffee (Tier 2). The confections at Auntie Bea's Sweet Treats are more than they seem \u2014 as is the shop's night hag proprietor.\nThose Who Are About to Die (Tier 2). The characters face waves of brutal combatants and devastating hazards in this arena of blood, death, and fire.\nBumpy Ride (Tier 2). A mage uses his airship and an array of deadly incendiary devices to terrorize other wizards into subservience, and the characters must put an end to it.\nDeadtention (Tier 2). An oni poses as the kindly headmaster of an academy for young sorcerers, where he uses a dark ritual to sacrifice faculty members and increase his power.\nIthrix Blackblood (Tier 2). A young black dragon uses his acidic breath to keep a band of trolls under his sway in an ancient cyclopean ruin.\nThe Blue Dragon Spellthief (Tier 3). The characters pursue a blue dragon mage set on robbing an arcane vault filled with volatile magical artifacts.\nThe Blade Queen's Throne (Tier 3).

A cloud giant vampire moves across the sky in a red cloud castle defended by monstrous thralls and vampire spawn, raining blood upon the land that raises ghouls in its wake.\nThe Lich's Sanctum (Tier 4). In an astral sanctum that defies natural physics, the characters battle an ancient lich responsible for the deaths of nine worlds.\nPut the Monster Back (Tier 4). The tarrasque breaks free of a secure facility designed to hold the worst monsters of creation, and will tear through the walls of reality, devouring entire worlds unless the characters stop it.\nBlood and Gold (Tier 4). In a shattered celestial temple, an ancient gold dragon is possessed by a demon prince encased in a spike buried in the dragon's chest, and threatens the mystical pillar that holds the multiverse together.\n (Many of these lair names are placeholders for now, and are likely to change.)\nSurprise-dra!

Each outline is like a summary that you can use as a starting point and narrative guideline to build a full adventure or campaign, highlighting potential plot points, cool backstories, great locations, exciting encounters, memorable NPCs and monsters, and more.\nThese outlines will be written by TK Johnson, LaTia Jacquise, Lysa Penrose, Jen Vaughn, Leon Barillaro, Willy Abeel, Casey Machado, Collette Quach, Rich Lescouflair, and Jess Ross.\nWe're also adding THREE final, special boss lairs based on suggestions given to us by backers.

Both printing and shipping costs vary depending on the size of the book and any increases in costs from the printers, but they are usually very reasonable (roughly $11 for the softcover and $23 for the hardcover + shipping).\nDelivering books through a print-on-demand publisher helps us keep the costs down as much as possible.

The Kickstarter includes a town sourcebook for Cat's Cradle, the adventure Eye of Itral, and Fortune Hunters, a book of town-oriented NPCs. This Kickstarter is a bit different from our normal approach -- see \"PPA Loan and COVID-19\" below.\nA Place of Dangers and Opportunities\nA walled town of roughly 4000 citizens, Cat's Cradle is a modular resource that can be used any time you need a town at the intersection of trade routes. In the world of the Lost Lands it is located in the Duchy of Saxe, at the intersection of the Gap Road and the Hyon River. This puts the town conveniently close to the Necromancer Games adventure Trouble at Durbenford. The primary focus of this 3-book set, though, is to fill in the gap when you need a relatively detailed town on short notice.\nWhat\u2019s in Cat\u2019s Cradle?\nCat's Cradle Sourcebook: A 44-page sourcebook on the shops, industries, factions, and mysteries of Cat\u2019s Cradle. This book is system neutral.\nThe Eye of Itral: A 44-page \u201cfantasy noir\u201d adventure in Cat\u2019s Cradle written by Ken Spencer. Available for 5th Edition, Swords & Wizardry, and Pathfinder 1e.\nFortune Hunters: A plethora of NPCs who live in and drift through the town. Available for 5th Edition, Swords & Wizardry, and Pathfinder 1e. 44 pages.\nAll three of the books are premium-quality paper, saddle-stitched, and printed in the USA.\nPPA Loan and COVID-19\nWe\u2019re using the proceeds of a PPA loan to employ our writers and artists on an immediate basis, which lets us keep paying them at normal levels despite a bad market. For this reason, we\u2019re following the unusual procedure of offering a Kickstarter before the work itself is completed. The books will be printed at the Arizona printshop we use for Indiegogo projects rather than in China, which allows us a much faster turnaround to backers. Most of the initial legwork has already been done, and the project should be almost completed by the time the Kickstarter ends, with the exception of layout and some of the art orders. To the extent the Kickstarter generates any profit \u2014 which isn\u2019t guaranteed in this market \u2014 we will continue turning the profit around to new projects, to generate as steady a stream of work-flow as we can.\nThe Books\n  The Cat's Cradle Sourcebook describes the important locations in the town and its immediate surroundings, such as the \"salt\" mines formed by the ancient intersection of some massive interplanar beast with the material plane. The otherworldly mineral deposits left behind are used in Cat's Cradle's thriving alchemy-related businesses.\n The Eye of Itral is a \"film noir\" type adventure set in Cat's Cradle, written by Ken Spencer. Mysteries and secrets abound, and some of them can be very, very dangerous...\n Fortune Hunters is a book of non-player characters that may be encountered in town. Each of the NPCs is detailed at three different points in their history: low level, medium level, and high level. They can be used as recurring allies or villains with ready explanations of what they have been doing since the last time the characters encountered them.\nStretch Goals\nOur Stretch Goals for this Kickstarter are parts of the Waypoints series written by Mike \"Sieg\" Stewart. \nAdventure is what your players crave. They seek fortune around every corner. Alas, glory is often found in remote locales that require a perilous journey before they can even begin their quest. Expeditions do not happen instantly, and the journey can be an adventure all its own. What will they find? Where will they stay? Where can they get a drink on the way? Waypoints is a series of digital releases focused on individual places that range from key locations such as a temple within a city to a secluded inn at the edge of civilization, its lonely hall only nominally a subject to any faraway king. The Waypoints series will highlight a single business, public building, or other more fantastical point of interest and is designed to be a creative interlude for everything from rest to rescue. All the mechanics within the text are general and designed to apply to any popular tabletop roleplaying game system.\n UNLOCKED! $18,000 Waypoints: General Store (PDF)\n UNLOCKED! $21,000 Waypoints: Bazaar (PDF)\n UNLOCKED! $25,000 Waypoints: Armorer (PDF)\n[LOCKED] $30,000 Waypoints: The Gaol (PDF)\nShipping\nDigital Reward Shipping\nYou will be receiving a kickstarter survey to finalize your address and contact information. We will email the instructions to groups of eligible backers with instructions on how to access PDF pledge rewards. This is a three-step process that is completed using our web store. You will have to create a customer account on the Frog God Games website to get your PDF; it's how we keep track of everything. The Kickstarter PDF files are 'purchased' at zero cost by backers (as they are paid for after the Kickstarter) at the Frog God Games web store using a coupon code. That code will be sent via email to backers at the email address provided in the Kickstarter survey. This process gets you your correct reward, ensures your future access to your reward files, and allows us to track project fulfillment. If you are missing something from your account, and see all over Facebook that everyone else has it, please email Mike at mike@froggodgames.com, and he will set things right for you. Be patient for a few days after it is first released though, as we do release these in batches to prevent crashing our server.\nPhysical Reward Shipping\n Your Kickstarter pledge amount does not include shipping.\nYou will be receiving a kickstarter survey to finalize your address and contact information. The first step toward getting your softcover set(s) to you. The second step, once the rewards are ready to ship, will be detailed in an email. This email will contain instructions to complete your reward selection and pay for it to be shipped to you. This step is also where your system selection(s) of 5e, S&W, or PFRPG takes place. This will be done using the Frog God website.\nShipping Damage or other Related Issues\nNo matter what we do, the post office seems to have a desire to drop, kick, throw or even drive over some packages with trucks (yes, it has happened). In the unlikely event that you are one of the lucky folks that have this happen to you, we will of course send you a new book. All you need to do is send photos of the damage in an email to Mike at mike@froggodgames.com. He will set you up with a new book. Please do not send multiple emails to multiple sources as it confuses the process and may cause delay. That being said, we have a 100% delivery promise on our books. You are the reason we are able to make cool products, and your satisfaction matters to us.\nRefunds\nIf for some reason you need a refund post-Kickstarter, we are happy to oblige, less a 13% charge that we pay to Kickstarter and Paypal.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nUnlike most of our Kickstarters, this one is being produced in real-time rather than before launch in order to provide an income stream to creators from our PPA loan. We estimate that the writing will be completed before the Kickstarter ends, but the project carries the risks associated with projects that launch before substantial completion.\nFrog God Games has been in business since 2010, and has fulfilled numerous (27!) Kickstarter projects. As with any crowdfunding program, the time-lapse between payment and delivery of a final product is subject to various risks, including the failure of a supplier, damage in shipment, disruptions within a company, and changes in the prices of materials and shipping.

They all point to one place as the source of their collective woe \u2013 the primeval jungles and untouched shores of the legendary Skullcano Island!\nThrough eldritch sorcery and divine visions, these great users of magic have deduced that a terrible power has arrived on Skullcano Island, drawn to the light and life that is our world. These mysterious wardens of doom seek to perpetuate an apocalyptic extinction event that will plunge the world back into a primordial age, using the island's legendary kaiju to wipe the slate clean once and for all. \nNow that the land is filled with these terrible tidings of the apocalypse and all signs point to Skullcano Island, a call has gone out for only the most experienced and powerful of adventurers. An elite fellowship has been assembled and sent forth to discover what the true heart of this menace is and, if able, put a stop to it before the entire world is reduced to ashes. Will the player characters survive and \u2013 if so \u2013 what will remain of the world when they are done?\nThe Skullcano, Illustrated by Ed Bickford\nMuch like our previous adventure modules, Escape from Skullcano Island is an old school, grindhouse-style combination of classic role playing adventure and 5E roleplaying style cram-packed with b-movie, monster movie-era badassery to challenge even the most seasoned of adventurers.  This is our most ambitious and outright crazy adventure module yet. It clocks in at over 100 pages and if the stretch goals are met, it could be as large as 140 pages! A fellow writer got a sneak peek and said \"If the Isle of Dread dropped LSD with the island from Lost while watching old giant monster movies and listening to Black Sabbath, this is the adventure that you'd get\". I honestly couldn't think of a better endorsement.\nEscape from Skullcano Island is a high level adventure designed for a group of Tier 4 player characters, but is easily scalable for Tier 3 level challenges. If slappin' down apocalyptic death cults or taking on titanic kaiju in a land that time forgot is in your wheelhouse, then you're in the right place. We're excited to take you back to a time when the simplest things in life were worrying about making your saving throw against some giant monster's lightning breath or duking it out toe to toe with a bunch of entropy-worshiping doomslakers in the heart of a raging volcano. Oh, and there's plenty of face-offs against slobbering monsters of all shapes and sizes to whet your appetite for the old school. Feel like taking on a two-headed gorilla-god in the ruins of ancient flooded forest? We've got that too, in all the pulpy, retro, Grindhouse-style you can handle. In the end, we wanted to write the kind of stuff that we would want to play ourselves. After all, who wants to spend a night of gaming not having fun?\nIf its not obvious by now, this adventure is full of kaiju - titanic monsters that dwarf even the most savage of wild beasts. Make no mistake though - this is definitely a heroic fantasy adventure module that involves equal measures of combat and good ole\u2019 fashioned hex-crawling, as the players at first find themselves dealing with the mysteries of a strange island lost to man and then later exploring the inner recesses of the titular Skullcano itself. All along the way, legendary titans stalk the land followed by their often-inhuman and bloodthirsty cargo-cult worshipers! \nKaiju, Illustrated by John Gulow\nThe design team at Planet X Games is an established company with a solid Kickstarter history full of  published, talented artists and hardcore role playing gaming vets excited to  bring you a unique role playing experience unlike any other. With fully  realized, professional-level art and maps, deadly new monsters, fresh new magical items and fully expanded locations in and around the savage territories of Skullcano Island, get ready to set your players on course for a head on collision with a lost island and the apocalyptic mega-titans that roam its shores!\nSo what\u2019s so special about this module and what makes it different?  What exactly is the Grindhouse-Style?\nAny devoted movie fan can tell you that a \u201cgrindhouse\" was an  American term for a movie theater that mainly showed exploitation and  genre films, with cut-rate ticket prices and often questionable  atmosphere.\nWe\u2019re bringing that atmosphere, old school style and all the b-movie, monster movie fun that comes with it to the gaming table. Our adventurers put the grind in Grindhouse, with dangers aplenty to keep your players wondering if they really want to head back into that dungeon. We\u2019re combining that with top shelf art, incredible cartography and explosive encounters to give you and your players something to chew on and talk about over the gaming table for years to come.\nCartography by Karl Stjernburg, @skullfungus\nEscape from Skullcano Island features illustrations and full-scale cartography by  many talented artists, including Adrian Landeros, Karl Stjernberg, Edwin Bickford III, John Gulow, Je Shields, Diogo Noguiera, Keelan Halvorsen and Lawrence Hernandez.\nHere\u2019s a small peek at the sort of crunchy goodness you can find between its covers:\n\u00b7 Full details on the titanic kaiju who roam Skullcano Island... as well as the apocalyptic death cult that seeks to unleash them on an unsuspecting world!

These spells and many more are included to add a little something new to the Game Master's toolbox and help make Escape from Skullcano Island feel unique for your players.\n\u00b7 We're bringing back the Trope Mechanic! Part of what makes all Planet X  modules feel unique is the atmosphere and setting, and tropes go a long  way towards giving Escape from Skullcano Island that monster movie \u201cGrindhouse\u201d flavor.\nThe Sentinel of Vitto-Bors, Illustrated by Adrian Landeros\nSTRETCH GOALS\n$1000 \u2013 The ground shall shake and the skies turn red - we're FUNDED!

The weapons of mass destruction ceased to work as the laws of physics altered. In their wake came elementals and demons, creatures from the darkest dreams and nightmares of mankind. Magic returned to the world. Humankind arose from the ashes and rebuilt society, just as the vile Empire of the East wielded the demonic powers of Orcus to sweep across the globe. Now it falls to a small group of resistance fighters to reclaim freedom for humanity!\nThe Empire of the East Sourcebook for DCC RPG\nWelcome to the Empire of the East role-playing game sourcebook, designed for the Dungeon Crawl Classics rules set, and also compatible with Mutant Crawl Classics. Herein you\u2019ll find information regarding Fred Saberhagen\u2019s seminal trilogy of novels, which set the stage for his rich fantasy world and were among Gary Gygax's stated Appendix N inspirations for Dungeons & Dragons.\nOfficially licensed by the estate of Fred Saberhagen, this hardcover sourcebook offers everything you need to play DCC RPG campaigns in the world of the Empire of the East. Lead designer Jason Vey has adapted the world in a simple, clean style that is easy to integrate into your DCC game, and Harley Stroh provides one of the introductory adventures included inside. Presented with stunning cover art by Ian Miller, you will find inside:\nRules for magic tailored to the post-apocalyptic fantasy setting of the Changeling Earth, including new spells and summonings to enrich any DCC campaign\nCharacter options for adventuring in this world\nA discussion of demons, elementals, and monsters, including stats for creatures compatible with any DCC and MCC campaign\nLost technology of the Golden Age of Man, and its effect on the Changeling Earth\nStatistics for all of the major characters from the trilogy, also usable as NPCs in any DCC or MCC campaign\nTwo short low-level adventures to start your campaign\nAnd more!\nUsing this sourcebook requires the DCC RPG core rulebook. While this sourcebook contains all you need to play a campaign, Saberhagen\u2019s novels are an invaluable resource in understanding the setting.  We highly recommend you also read the Saberhagen Empire of the East series, available as a modern compilation or in the original three individual volumes, titled The Broken Lands, The Black Mountains, and Ardneh\u2019s World (or Changeling Earth). \nTake up your sword, gather your spells, and stand with Ardneh\u2019s armies against John Ominor and his forces of darkness!\nPhysical format. This book is offered in PDF form, as well as hardcover print format. Final page count is estimated at 80-90 pages.\nDo I need to own the DCC rules? Yes. This is a sourcebook for DCC RPG. You can buy the DCC RPG core rulebook at the Goodman Games online store.\nDo I need to read Fred Saberhgagen's Empire of the East novels? You don't have to, but we strongly recommend it. They are great books and will expand your gaming experience considerably!\nInside the DCC Sourcebook\nDCC: The Empire of the East has been in development for years. Adapted by lead designer Jason Vey, the sourcebook takes you to the Empire of the East and gives you just enough information to create your own adventures there - while also leaving you room to design your own campaigns.\nAs with all DCC products from Goodman Games, the book is lavishly illustrated.\nChapter one covers adapting the existing character classes. \nChapter two covers magic, including new rules for spell enervation which can be substituted for corruption to capture the aesthetic of Empire of the East. Eighteen new spells are presented, including several related to the summoning or control of demons, djinnis and elementals as discussed in Fred Saberhagen's novels. There are two new patron AIs presented, capturing the role of Ardneh and Orcus from the original novels.\nSome readers may be asking, why is Empire of the East presented as compatible with DCC instead of Mutant Crawl Classics? This hardcover can be used easily in either system, but due to the high presence of magic we're presenting it as a DCC \"base.\" \nChapter three presents monsters. There are seven creatures, as well as new rules for demons, djinns and elementals.\nChapter four presents personalities of the Changeling Earth. These 16 NPCs from the stories can be used as allies or enemies in your campaign.\nChapter five is science, technology and magic. Those of you who have read the novels know that \"the Elephant\" plays a mighty part in the plot. We do not burden you with detailed stats for the super-science of the Changeling Earth but instead give general guidelines for inserting these items into your game.\nChapter seven presents two new adventures set in the Changeling Earth: Invaders, a level 0-1 adventure by Jason Vey, and The Demon Key, a level 0-1 adventure by Harley Stroh. \nThe Empire of the East Novels\nIn the distant future, society has crumbled. Dark forces now rule the land, keeping all humans under their oppressive thumbs.\nIn the darkness of the shadows and whispered on the winds, there is talk of a rebellion. In the swamps, a small band has formed. Determined to regain their freedom, the rebellion, heavily outnumbered, plans to overthrow an army of thousands . . . with the help of one incredible weapon.\nIt is only a legend, a story left over from the Old World before magic and the wizards came to the land. A weapon of technology. It is the mystical Elephant, and whoever masters it holds the key to freedom, or defeat.\nOne young man, determined to avenge the death of his family, sets out to join the rebellion and find Elephant. What he discovers will change everything.\nThe Empire of the East novels are still in print decades after their original publication. You can find vintage editions online. The author's estate has recently released updated e-book editions, which are available in Kindle format on Amazon. You can find them here:\nEmpire of the East Book I: The Broken Lands\nEmpire of the East Book II: The Black Mountains\nEmpire of the East Book III: Ardneh's World \nWhat is DCC RPG?\nThe Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game is a modern RPG that reflects D&D\u2019s origin-point concepts with decades-later rules editions. From the company that was publishing old-school modules before the OSR ever existed, DCC RPG is not an old-school clone, but a re-imagining of what D&D could have been, utilizing the game\u2019s primary sources of inspiration.

An event called \"The Reckoning\" awakened an ancient evil, and you'd best hope the howls you hear on the High Plains are just a pack of ravenous wolves...\n \"The Year is 1876, but the history is not our own...\"\nThese words introduced Deadlands to the world back in 1996, spawning decades of amazing tales and memorable monsters. Now the granddaddy of Horror Western games is back with a brand new edition. \nThe cover that started it all, the original Deadlands, by Brom!\nIt's now 1884 in the official timeline. The Civil War ended in 1871 at the Battle of Washington, an epic conflagration of steam and steel. The Great Rail Wars are over as well, finishing not with a whimper but the bang of  Dr. Darius Hellstromme's ghostfire bombs at the gates of Lost Angels.\nEven the Servitors, the Reckoners' chosen champions on Earth, have been defeated\u2014at least for a while. Reverend Grimme vanished in a massive flood that destroyed his city, Raven's Last Sons were defeated by the Great Summoning, Stone was foiled in the barren expanse of Death Valley, and Dr. Hellstromme's latest scheme to open the gates of Hell proved fruitless.\nWe told the tale of the Servitors in four Plot Point Campaigns, still available and ready to play with just a little tinkering for this edition on our website!\nIn response, the Reckoners have turned their blasphemous gaze back to the grassroots of evil. They've given life to dark desires and horrible abominations that live in the shadows of the isolated frontier, far away from the attention garnered by the overt plans of their Servitors.\nThe heroes of the Weird West join with the secretive Twilight Legion in the distant outposts, chaotic boomtowns, and lonely settlements of the West to fight evil and quell the fear that gives the Reckoners their power.\nSo gather your posse of heroes and hit the trail, from the frozen north to the arid deserts of the Southwest, from the industrial East to the fractured canyons of California's \"Great Maze.\" \nThe Weird West awaits with adventure, mystery, and more monsters than you can shake a Peacemaker at.\nThink these Mojave rattlers look nasty? You should see the rest of it!\nDeadlands is the long-awaited return to Pinnacle's oldest and most popular setting. First published in 1996, the original \"Deadlands Classic\" system won countless awards and its bold, bright orange books are still a striking and valuable addition to gaming shelves the world over. \nFor those who want the whole experience, Deadlands has a rich and varied history to explore!\nDeadlands has told some epic tales since it first burst onto the scene in 1996, but you don't need to be steeped in its storied past to join in the hootin' and hollerin'. If you're an old hand, we think you'll find it both familiar and refreshing.  If you're new to the world or setting, this is the perfect time to join the wagon train (and if you've lapsed, we forgive you for that, partner). We've recapped and summarized the monumental events of the last 24 years so you can catch up.\nThis new edition is the biggest revamp of the game's background and rules since the Reloaded edition from 2005. It's been revised, rewritten, and refocused by both Deadlands Line Editor Matthew Cutter and original creator Shane Hensley.\nBack in the Saddle, by Aaron Riley!\nAll the rules have been updated and adapted to the latest version of the Savage Worlds Adventure Edition. You'll need that book to play. You can add it to your pledge as an Add On if you don't already have it, or you can check out the PDF now.\nArcane Backgrounds are tightened up. Those nasty Harrowed had the same overhaul we gave them in Lost Colony (including letting the Devil out!). There are new and streamlined rules for dueling. And of course a passel of new Edges, gear, infernal devices, and powers to blast the tarnation out of the creepy crawlies coming to do your party in.\nFor you Marshals (that's what we call our Game Masters), there's a comprehensive overview of the Weird West after the events of the Servitor Plot Point Campaigns, including new plots, perils, and intrigue for cowtowns, boomtowns, and old favorites like Lost Angels, Tombstone, Deadwood, Dodge, the City o\u2019 Gloom, and a few new locales we might surprise you with! And of course this handsome tome also includes enough rascals, varmints, and critters to keep a posse busy 'til doomsday.\nThis is more than just a rules update--it's a world update! And check out that gorgeous new graphic design by Karl Keesler, with art by some of the best in the business!\nNow that the tales of the Servitors have been told in their individual Plot Point Campaigns, Deadlands is returning to its roots with more local yarns of dread, terror, and violent action. The new edition and supplements to follow turn their baleful eyes from the world-shaking events of the Reckoning to isolated frontier towns or sinister machinations in the few larger settlements. The Twilight Legion must root out the evil that lurks in all-too-human souls, the lonesome hills nearby, or the dark woods at the edge of town.\nTo showcase the return to more personal tales of horror and adventure, we've created the Horror at Headstone Hill campaign set!\nThe campaign features a single county in Wyoming and the terrors that lurk in a booming mining town and environs. Your heroes roam about the map, interacting with the locals, solving mysteries, fighting abominations, and\u2014with luck and a steady shootin' iron\u2014eventually lower the \"Fear Level.\" That's how you defeat the Reckoners' terrorforming, amigos, and Horror at Headstone Hill showcases it front and center.\nThe Horror at Headstone Hill Campaign Boxed Set!\nThe Deadlands: Horror at Headstone Hill Boxed Set contains an introductory booklet on the region for the players with notes from Tombstone Epitaph reporter Lacy O'Malley and the Twilight Legion, a Marshal's guide detailing all the locations on the map and a full sandbox-oriented Plot Point Campaign, a poster-sized map of the county, and a selection of player handouts to drive this incredible tale of six-guns and sorcery to its bloodstained conclusion!\n Something happened at Devil's Tower recently. Something terrible. A being called the Cackler raised a powerful sorceress of legend, Morgan Le Fay, sending ripples through the many worlds of Deadlands. From the Dark Ages to the far future planet of Banshee in Lost Colony, the \"Morgana Effect\" has caused subtle changes from the world we knew before.\nThe Cackler and his unholy posse ride the range in this world-changing graphic novel by Shane Lacy Hensley!\n The Morgana Effect is a big story that ripples (quietly for now) through all the settings of Deadlands\u2014including the upcoming Deadlands: Dark Ages, the Weird West, Noir, Hell on Earth, and already released Lost Colony. It's also a story-based reason to change the rules and some parts of the setting we've been hankerin' to adjust for a while. You can read more about the latter here, but we think even those of you who have been with us since '96 will welcome the changes once you take 'er for a test ride.\nOver the years we've seen some amazing gaming setups, but collecting and painting a comprehensive collection of cowpokes and critters can be both time consuming and expensive. That's where the Deadlands Pawns come in. \nThe Deadlands Pawns Boxed Set contains over 100 Deadlands characters and critters printed on thick punchboard!\nWe've created a selection of heroes, villains, and monsters in thick punchboard (the sturdy stuff board game tokens are made from) to represent some of the most common and iconic encounters in the Weird West. These figures are even die-cut to the contour of the character image to make each pose as dynamic and striking as possible.\nThe Deadlands Pawns Boxed Set contains 8 sheets of thick punchboard, containing over 100 pawns to bring the Weird West alive on your tabletop. If the set does well, we will expand the line to include additional Deadlands sets and pawn sets for our other lines. \nThat's enough jawin'. Now let's talk about what's really important...what you get for helping us bring the Weird West to life!\nWe've set up the reward tiers to be as simple as possible while still covering the most popular combinations you sidewinders always ask for. We've done 21 of these Kickstarters now, so we have a pretty good handle on things. But if you don't see the particular combination you want, just pledge for the book and add on anything else in the pledge manager we'll launch sometime after the campaign closes.\nRead full details for Retailers in our Savage Retailer newsletter here!\nThe core book for Deadlands: The Weird West is a 192-page hardcover book, in our usual \"graphic novel\" size, and glorious, bloody, full-color throughout. That amazing cover is by Aaron Riley, a fan favorite of the entire Savage Worlds line!\nDeadlands Boxed Set contains the hardcover core rulebook, brand new poster map of the Weird West, GM Screen + Adventure, Set of 25 Bennies, Set of 7 dice, and a set of 12 Archetype Cards, along with Power Cards, Adventure Cards, and Infernal Device Cards\u2014all housed in a sturdy and attractive box to match your Deadlands: Lost Colony Boxed Set!\nThe Deadlands the Weird West Core Boxed Set includes a copy of the hardcover rules as well as a brand new poster map of the Weird West by the phenomenal Cheyenne Wright, a set of 25 Bennies, a set of custom-colored dice and Wild Die, and a Game Master's screen and introductory adventure, Double Down at Sundown, by Rob Wieland!\nWant to see the new screen? Here it is, partner! The tri-fold screen is our usual landscape format with gorgeous art on one side and all the charts and tables the Marshal needs on the other!\nThe new GM Screen for Deadlands: the Weird West! Click here to view Federico Musetti's gorgeous art as a larger image.\nHorror at Headstone Hill Boxed Set contains a Player's Guide booklet, a Marshal's book with a full Plot Point Campaign, a poster map or Uinta County, and several pages of player aids and handouts. Art not final.\nDeadlands Pawns Boxed Set contains 8 sheets of thick punchboard containing stunning full color miniatures die-cut to give you over 100 miniatures for use in your Deadlands games. Art not final.\nAfter the Kickstarter is over you'll be invited to a pledge manager so you can add any additional Pinnacle products you want to your order. Want the Rippers Resurrected Expedition Amazon supplement or Deadlands: Lost Colony or Rifts\u00ae for Savage Worlds Boxed Set? These will all be available to ship with your order.\nIf you want those existing items right now, partner, just head over to www.peginc.com and order, but please realize you'll have to pay shipping on that separately.\nIf you want to order everything at once in the pledge manager (to combine shipping with your Deadlands rewards) everything will be delivered toward the end of 2020. \nAdd-Ons require pledging for a physical reward level. \nAnd if you want to budget or add Deadlands-specific Add-Ons to your Kickstarter pledge now, here are the prices. Thanks as always for your support of our little company!\nWe always like to sweeten the pot. Help us reach our funding goals and we'll add a passel of digital and physical rewards. The first is a set of the cool new Harrowed \"Dominion Cards\" by Cheyenne Wright! If we reach that Stretch Goal, a set of cards will be added to every Deadlands Core Boxed Set. (You can order them as an Add-On as well.)\nWant to hear more from Sounds Like Crowes? Check out their website here.\nLearn more about the Wildcards and Saving Throw by clicking here!\nCheck back frequently to see where we're at, and tell your friends to check out our project\u2014every pledge means more for everyone!\nHelp us unlock more stretch goals by sharing the project! Here's where you can find us on social media:\nDeadlands and Horror at Headstone Hill are both written and in layout. Your help allows us to create all the extras we want to make and get the word out to other fans (by far the hardest challenge for a small company like ours).\nWe plan to deliver the PDF of the core rules a few weeks after the project funds and we get the final backer list from Kickstarter.  This means delivery of the main PDFs about a month after funding and the physical products about 5 months later depending on the printer and shipping, and barring unforeseen mishaps...y'know, like world-wide pandemics and all!\nDigital Rewards\nWe deliver PDF materials through the Pinnacle website and DriveThruRPG.\nPhysical Rewards\nAfter the Kickstarter ends we'll use a pledge manager to collate the physical pledges and allow you the opportunity to include additional Pinnacle products with your pledge. You will pay for shipping after the Kickstarter using the pledge manager. \nClick here to view larger image\nAll prices in USD and based on estimates calculated April 2020.\nCustoms and Taxes for EU, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand\nWe know that international shipping is an expensive part of buying games and we're constantly looking for ways to reduce those costs.\nThe above rates are postage only. Depending on your location, additional VAT/GST will be added to your order in the pledge manager. For example, current VAT for books in the UK is 0%, while Denmark is 25%. After collecting these fees in the pledge manager, our regional partners pay the taxes and file paperwork for you during shipping!\nTo save on international shipping, consider having one of your amigos pledge for your whole posse, then \"Add-On\" additional books to a single package. You should also encourage your local retailer to sign up as a Savage Retailer so they can order directly from us (before it hits regular distribution). Then you can buy the physical product from your favorite local game store, while you pledge at a digital reward level so you don't miss out on the digital Stretch Goals.\nWe Ship Anywhere in the World\nEmail site.admin@peginc.com for an estimate to ship to your location if you don't see it above.  You can also use the handy calculator at USPS.com (most rewards ship in a 12x12x12 inch box).\nDelivery for Merchants\nRead full details for Retailers in our Savage Retailer newsletter here!\nAll retailers located in the contiguous United States receive free shipping. Retailers in Hawaii, Alaska, and outside the United States receive discounted shipping. The store also receives Kickstarter product before retail release and may restock other Pinnacle product with their order.

The PRINT version is available here or here and the PDF version is here.\n Previous Reviews and Previews \n\"I like how this adventure uses a setting that is probably underserved in this genre (Appendix N version of the fey lands) and is of a high production value. I hope to see more like it to come.\"--Fromrpg.net\n\"...So why are you still sitting there reading this? Go make a pledge and get some yourself some official old school gaming goodness...\"  --From Goodman Games\n\"Greenwood of the Fey Sovereign looks like a fun little funnel at the right price - 7 bucks for the PDF, 10 bucks for the Print copy and 15 for Print plus PDF. I love the art...\"--From Tenkar's Tavern\n\"It is a really cool and interesting adventure, I am really looking forward to what C. Aaron Kreader does in the future ...I highly recommend it [Reckoning of the Gods] if you are a fan of the DCC.\" --From Nick Baran BPG Review \nAdd-On\nYou can add-on the 20-page PRINT or PDF edition of: Greenwood of the Fey Sovereign module to your order:\nPDF edition:           add +$7 USD to any pledge\nPRINT edition:       add +$10 USD to a PRINT pledge.\nPRINT & PDF:         add +$15 USD to a PRINT pledge. \nYou can add-on this 32-page double adventure in PRINT or PDF format: Reckoning of the Gods-Into the Shadow Realm module to your order:\nPDF edition:           add +$9 USD to any pledge\nPRINT edition:       add +$15 USD to a PRINT pledge.\nPRINT & PDF:         add +$20 USD to a PRINT pledge. \nWhat is DCC RPG?\nThe funnest, most amazing, new (yet classic) role-playing game out there. If you want to jump into the old school RPG feel, if you played AD&D and want to get your kids into the games that had the snap you remember, this is the system.\nIt is easy to pick up for people new to RPG games, and a blast for those of us who played the original AD&D classics and games like Gamma World. It has the feel of the Gary Gygax vision for the genre, yet it is a system that improves a lot of the holes in the original systems without getting too complex. Read more here. Best of all you really only need 1 book (to rule them all, and in the darkness bind them). They even have a $5 quickstart rulebook, but i highly recommend the full book since it has all the lovely details, art, and charts you will want.\nThis product is based on the Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game, published by Goodman Games.

Herein you will encounter nobles, priests, guilders, aliens, psychics, cyborgs, and more.\nThe Character Book (272 pages) presents the game system and player characters for Fading Suns. This book includes character creation rules for all the major factions, as well as technological equipment, starships, psychic powers, and theurgic rites.\nThe Gamemaster Book (96 pages) presents people, places, and plots for Fading Suns. Herein are guidelines for creating dramas for the player troupe and how to populate them with all manner of non-player-character allies, rivals, and foils. An example drama is included, as well as a roll-by-roll description of play.\nIn addition, we have a variety of books and accessories to help you fill in whatever you need at your table:\nThe Faction Book (96 page hardcover) presents the minor houses (from Eldrid to Xanthippe), minor sects (from Chorali to Preceptors), and minor guilds (Apothecaries to Wranglers) of the Fading Suns universe. Herein also are the pagans (Zuranists and Gjartins), the sentient alien species of the Known Worlds (from ascorbites to shantor), and the Changed, the genetically altered mutants scorned by the superstitious populace for their wondrous endowments.\n Intrigues & Escapades (112 page hardcover) unveils the conspiracy customs among nobles, priests, and merchants, showing how some are raised from birth to scheme while others learn from hard knocks. Presented are two detailed dramas involving troupes in such dirty dealings, along with a host of drama hooks that gamemasters can develop with their own twists.\n The GM Screen & Token Set includes the most useful rules and charts: sequence of play, VP costs, Resistance ratings, environmental conditions, weapon traits, and more. Also included are punch sheets with a plethora of victory-point and wyrd-point tokens, making it easy to gain and spend these action resources during play.\nThe Imperial Dossiers for the House Hawkwood, Reeves Guild, and Urth Orthodox factions (64 page softcover) examine in-depth the main factions of the Fading Suns universe. Each book serves as a primer on a single faction, commissioned by the empire for its diplomats, bureaucrats, soldiers, star-sailors, Questing Knights, and their Cohorts, with commentary from the Imperial Eye. Each book also includes a \u201cfactbook\u201d about a topic closely related to the dossier\u2019s faction, and a rules section that includes new callings, perks, equipment, and even alien creatures.\nIf you're returning to Fading Suns as a veteran player, make sure you head to our website to catch up on all of Bill's designer diaries!\nIf you're brand new to Fading Suns, check out our Introduction document or the Ulisses International YouTube Channel for our current actual play series.

Like a CGI remake of a Disney Animation, a new version of an old thing you already like! \nYes we have finally reached the level of penury and moral decay required to try to sell you all something that many of you have already bought, but now with EXTRA STUFF!\nWait! What is this \"Deep Carbon Observatory\"?\nGo down to the bottom and I will explain.\nFor the rest of you; \"what extra stuff ?\" I hear you say.\nHere is a video!\nMaps!\nAbsolutely everyone complained about the maps in the original version. Well now we have all-new semi-isometric maps by Dirk Leichty of Silent Titans, Super Blood Harvest and probably soon to be many other projects!\nA new map of the Drowned Lands! \nA new map of the Dam! \nA new map of the Observatory itself! \nOLD ART -  BUT BIGGER\nIts the old art you enjoyed when it was small, but now HUGE! \nWith an A4 format we have been able to put in all the previous images, except now instead of being tiny and grey on PoD paper, they are HUGE and BLACK with the finest of inks!\nNEW ART!!\nEach Turbine Golem now gets an individual, full-page, illustration!\nThis guy is in there!\nAnd this guy!\nIn fact in this 104 page book there are only 33 pages without some image or illustration! \nWe have hot, fresh art all over this thing!\nNew Material!\nRemember all that extra stuff you asked for? Well at least some of it has been included!\nSpreads on how to run The Crows\nA spread of thirty hooks to kick off your adventure.\nRe-written background so things make (slightly) more sense.\nA 'Race to the Observatory' section to make the trip slightly less static and to add in moving elements to the Observatory at the end, should you desire them.\nLogistics, travel and mechanical bits and pieces now make (proportionately more) sense!\nAnd at least some playtesting! Not all of which was ignored!\n\nNew Layout!\nEverything is now arranged in numbered two-page spreads. If you open the book to any spread, all the information you need to run everything there should be visible to you. \nFinding Stuff - Every time you need to find something there should be a title and a Spread Number indicating where to go and what to look for. Just turn to the spread indicated and see the large, bolded and centred title of the thing you seek.\nFor a handful of things where this wouldn't work, there are also Element Numbers, and even page numbers.\nEvery numbering system is a different colour. Large black Spread Numbers, Red Element Numbers and Blue Page Numbers. Never be confused (hopefully) again!\nA Contents Page\nand an Index at the back!\n\nWhat About the PDF?\n We don't really know yet!\nThe standard PDF should be really easy to produce. My intention as we go through stretch goals is to keep adding functionality and desired things to the PDF as we go.\nI've been asking questions online about what you want, so my intention is to add;\nBookmarks\nHyperlinks and return Hyperlinks\nLayers you can turn off for easy printing and cut and pasting\nNo DRM\nMaps on their own pages.\nAvailable through DTRPG\n\nHow Are We Making It?\nThe book should be printed by Biddles in the U.K., then shipped to me. \nThe PDF should be available via DTRPG, everyone who backed for that gets a code to make it free.\nThe book will be put on sale on my BigCartel store, anyone who backed for it will be send a code to make the purchase free.\nYou will still need to pay postage for the book.  It will be send Royal Mail International Standard. I am hoping it will count as a 'large letter', which will hopefully keep UK to US postage under \u00a310. If it is too think it will be a 'small parcel', meaning UK to US postage will be about \u00a313.\nI am doing all the post myself - this keeps it super simple and reduces admin and costs, unfortunately it also guarantees that it will take AGES to send all the books. Think maybe at least a month after they are received.\n\nSimple Kickstarter\nTwo Options;\nThe PDF on its own.\nThe book, including the PDF.\nThat's it. Everyone who goes for the book option also gets the PDF. Everyone who gets the PDF gets it with whatever extra functionality we could jam in via the Kickstarter levels.\n\nWhat is \"Deep Carbon Observatory\"\nAn adventure for Dungeons and Dragons with stats and play assumptions based around an Old-School mindset, with stats, challenges and treasure based around the LotFP and BX Rulesets.\nThis was one of the first things I ever published. In fact Zzarchov Kowalski hired me to make it and then let me keep all the rights. It did surprisingly well back in the day (around 2014 I think).\nSince then everything I've made has gotten fancier and this old but popular adventure was sitting on Lulu and DriveThru RPG in a not that great PoD format.\nPlans to produce a new, better, version staggered along for a long time and with a wide variety  of different potential publishers until I eventually had a total breakdown and decided to do the whole thing myself. \n(And by myself I mean with Scrap.)\nThat has taken about a year, and here we are. Hovering on the edge of Final Doom.\nFrom the book itself; \"DCO is an adventure for Dungeons and Dragons that should work with any Old School system. It would best suit a low fantasy world where magic is difficult and rare and monsters frightening and \u2018other\u2019.\nDCO is theoretically survivable for a level 1 party if its players are extremely cunning and crafty. For most systems a party level between 3-5 would give the best experience. High levels of magic will empower the party and potentially make the adventure a lot easier.\"\nIts an adventure which begins in the wreckage of a great flood, takes the PCs through the ruination caused by that flood and puts them against a super-nasty 'rival party'; The Crows. Then takes them to the Deep Carbon Observatory itself, an ancient Treasure Palace and outpost of a forgotten underground empire built into a giant stalactite hanging over an abyssal sea.\n\nSTRETCH GOALS CHRIST HELP US ALL - [EDIT - we smashed this goal, no idea what to do next]\nFrom deep within the guts of greed, \"Kapital\" our pet marketing beast, has spoken.\nThe time for decency and dignity is at an end, now is the time for a great hunger which swallows all like a consuming maw!!\nBUISNESS!!\n Yes Trump may be about to be possibly flensed from the earth by Bernie Sanders wielding the Coronavirus like the Pharonic flail of an avenging God, but for those of us ensconced safely with our glittering towers there is still some chance at true LUXURY in this dying world.\nIf we hit a funding level of \u00a330,000.00 we will institute;\nSMASHED IT! (also check out my design chops)\n\nDeep Carbon Observatory - BLOATED OVERREACH EDITION!!! [YOU ARE GETTING IT!!!]\nTHICKER PAPER! - Now a luxurious 150gsm silk!\nSECTION SEWN HARDBACK - It already was though!\nTHREE RIBBON MARKERS  - You really seemed to want these so now you get classic DCO White, Black and RED. NEVER LOSE YOUR PLACE AGAIN.\nSPOT UV COVER - A translucent tactile shimmering image within an image. What will it be? No idea yet!\nPRINTED ENDPAPERS - All the maps to be included in the endpapers as well as inside the book!\nSOCIALLY CONSCIOUS TRILOBITE - After massive demand your old familiar friend from previous False Machine products will be making an appearence to introduce you to the book!\nFREE MAP FILES WITH THE PDF - Anyone downloading the PDF will have the option to download files of the maps. Print em' out and use them however you like!\nI THINK THATS IT??\nOH WAIT - A SHELF FOR ELGIN SCOTT SO HE HAS ROOM TO PLACE THE BOOK - I am only doing this once in my life and only because it is funny so don't ask me for stuff again, but YES, if we reach our goal we will buy this guy and Ikea Shelving Unit and have it shipped to his home.\n\nBEHOLD THE LARGESSE\nOk, with only six days left on the Kickstarter we have developed another, completely ridiculous stretch goal!\nNamed of course, for the long-loved and world famous stories of Bukako, the spell-consuming monkey and his partner and mount, the magical Pleasing Fish.\n\"Patrick what is the Feast of Bukako?\" I hear you cry.\nSome of you may be familiar with venerable-but-still-fresh calmpunk luminary and OSR blogger, Brendan Strejcek. Famed far and wide for his blog;\nNECROPRAXIS\nHere is Brendan, photographed earlier today;\nBack in 2015, Brendan did a book called 'Wonder and Wickedness'. (Just google Wonder and Wickedness for reviews).\nThis was a book of original spells notable for their mixture of poetry, clarity and especially the fact that they were LEVEL-LESS. \nAny Magic-User could learn any spell and the power and potential blowback of the spell, increased with the level of the Magic-User. So every spell was useful to every wizard.\nWouldn't it be great (I thought), if we could pay Brendan to do that for every spell in the D&D SRD and so change spellcasTing in D&D forever, for everyone, by totally altering the way they act with levels, and we could make the finished spellbook free for all.\nAnd that's very slightly, at a much smaller scale, what we propose to start doing now.\nThere are just over thirty spells in Deep Carbon Observatory. A handful new, but the rest standard D&D spells;\n- Avoid Notice \n- Bookspeak \n- Change Self \n- Control Weather\n- Earthquake\n- Ease Grief \n- Enlarge\n- ESP \n- Fear \n- Fly \n- Hide Sorrow \n- Identify \n- Invisibility \n- Lessen Pain \n- Locate Object \n- Magic Jar  \n- Magic Missile \n- Mending \n- Message \n- Mind Blank\n- Minimise Thirst \n- Mirror Image \n- Part Water\n- Permanency\n- Phantasmal Force\n- Polymorph Any Object\n- Reduce Scars \n- Shape Change\n- Shield\n- Shrink \n- Sleep \n- Speak With Animals \n- Suggestion \n- Trap the Soul\n- Wall of Fog\n- Water Breathing\nSo at our stretch goal, Scrap and I will institute the FEAST OF BUKAKO.\nThat goal is; \u00a335,000.00 \nIf we hit that we have agreed with Brendan that he will produce level-less rules for all of these spells. \nThose spells will then be made available to all in a BASIC (i.e. Just the Text, bookmarks etc) PDF that anyone can access.\nThis means first, that anyone who needs to find a spell while running or playing DCO can just grab this document.\nBut secondly, the long term (very long term) goal is to, every time False Machine produces a D&D adventure with spells, we hope to add new level-less versions by Brendan to the stretch goals, and then add the completed spells to the giant list.\nAnd, (I repeat), this will be free and accessible and usable by all.\nSo, if things go well, (in the future, which definitely will exist ha ha ha) ultimately, we should be able to produce a new old-school master-list of level-less spells which can go into the giant OSR/BX/D&D commons for any future project or game by anyone who wants them.\n(And then feed them to a Magic Monkey called Bukako obviously).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nStandard risks for a project involving me. \n\n- I go insane.\n- I screw up some minor detail that ends up crashing everything.\n- Its too popular and I get overwhelmed.\n- Its too unpopular because I can't be bothered doing marketing and doesn't happen.\n- Damp gets into the cargo container I am renting (am buying desiccants to try to avoid this).\n\nI managed to just about pull of the Gawain Kickstarter.

The Greatest Thieves in Lankhmar is a level 3 Dungeon Crawl Classics boxed set that sends characters into the hot cellars beneath Thieves\u2019 House, across the sooty rooftops of the City of Sevenscore Thousand Smokes, and on to a mad dash through the palace of the Overlord. Featuring design leads Harley Stroh and Marc Bruner with cover art by Doug Kovacs, this boxed set comes with everything you need to run an epic adventure over several sessions, whether you run it as a tournament or as part of an ongoing campaign.\nWhen you open the box, you\u2019ll be in the company of legends. The Greatest Thieves in Lankhmar was first run as a tournament at Gen Con 2019, where 20 nationally competitive teams competed over four fantastic days and three hard-fought rounds. Characters died alone, as they were lost beneath Thieves\u2019 House, flung from rooftops to die upon the hard cobbles, or felled by mind-bending puzzles deep within the Rainbow Palace.\nNo character has ever survived to the end of this adventure in tournament play. Could yours be the first? After 44% of tables experienced TPKs, and nearly 6 in 10 PCs were killed, one team triumphed to win the tournament. They had the high score under the tournament rules, but were still TPK'd in the end. Every player character to advance to round three has died on that level! \nThis Kickstarter brings a tournament adventure to players worldwide. One of the stretch goals is a global organized play of the tournament module. The International Tournament of Thieves could be your home group\u2019s chance to see their photograph and scores in print!\nLankhmar: The City of Seven-Thousand Score Smokes and twice as many thieves. But after tonight, one band will rule over all the others.\nIs your canting crew daring, cunning, and lucky enough to be crowned the Greatest Thieves in Lankhmar? Grab your dirk, a drink, and your tools. Lankhmar awaits.\nThe Greatest Thieves in Lankhmar will be published in a boxed format, with all the materials necessary to run it as it was first seen at Gen Con 2019. The box will include all three rounds of the original adventure, plus player handouts, maps, scoring sheets, a judge\u2019s pack, a player\u2019s pack, and more. You can also run the adventure as part of an ongoing campaign. Regardless of how your players experience it, you\u2019ll be able to score them using the adventure\u2019s scoring system, and compare their scores to the Gen Con contenders.\nMockup of what the boxed set will look like (image not final)\nIs this adventure only for thieves? The Greatest Thieves in Lankhmar uses the term \u201cthieves\u201d in a broad sense. Anyone who steals is a thief, regardless of character class! The tournament pregenerated characters include warriors and wizards, as well as thieves. You can play this adventure with any set of characters.\nDo I need to own the DCC Lankhmar boxed set? The adventure includes a primer on DCC Lankhmar rules, so you can play it with simply the DCC RPG core rulebook. Of course, if you have the DCC Lankhmar boxed set, that will make the experience even more rich.\nWhat is DCC RPG? The Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game is a modern RPG that reflects D&D\u2019s origin-point concepts with decades-later rules editions. From the company that was publishing old-school modules before the OSR ever existed, DCC RPG is not an old-school clone, but a re-imagining of what D&D could have been, utilizing the game\u2019s primary sources of inspiration. To quote from the back cover:\nYou\u2019re no hero.\nYou're an adventurer: a reaver, a cutpurse, a heathen-slayer, a tight-lipped warlock guarding long-dead secrets. You seek gold and glory, winning it with sword and spell, caked in the blood and filth of the weak, the dark, the demons, and the vanquished. There are treasures to be won deep underneath, and you shall have them.\nReturn to the glory days of fantasy with the Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game. Adventure as 1974 intended you to, with modern rules grounded in the origins of sword & sorcery. Fast play, cryptic secrets, and a mysterious past await you: turn the page\u2026 \nYou can learn more from this prior Kickstarter for the game's 4th printing. You can buy the 7th printing here. \nDoes your home group think they\u2019re great dungeon crawlers? This adventure will make them think again.\nBecause our tournament modules are played at Gen Con over a large sample of tables and judges, we are able to quantify their danger level. Based on this quantification we have a rating system to assess each tournament adventure\u2019s lethality. At Goodman Games, we call this the Count Dante rating.\nThe Greatest Thieves in Lankhmar receives a Count Dante rating of III (on a scale of I to VI). In tournament play, the adventure killed 74 of the 129 PCs who participated, or an average of 0.57 fatalities for every PC in the game. Over the course of three rounds, 44% of the tables to run this adventure suffered TPKs. (TPK stands for Total Party Kill.)\nThe published adventure module will include complete statistics from the Gen Con tournament, including judge and team stats, most popular pre-gens, and even deadliest rooms. For example: 70% of PCs to reach area 2-5 died in that room.\nIn other words, if your players think they\u2019re hot stuff, this adventure will put that to the test. Competitive dungeon crawlers at America\u2019s largest tabletop gaming convention suffered 57% fatality rates and a 44% TPK rate. But one team did triumph, and they were crowned The Greatest Thieves in Lankhmar. How will your home group fare?\nLankhmar is the most famous fantasy city of all time. It was created in 1937 by Fritz Leiber, who went on to coin the phrase \u201csword-and-sorcery\u201d to describe the genre of which it is part. Lankhmar\u2019s most famous residents are Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser. If you have not read the many wonderful stories of their adventures, you should start immediately! They are among the greatest fantasy stories ever written.\nLankhmar has a special place in tabletop role playing history. Its mythology appears in the original AD&D Deities & Demigods supplement, and TSR published a licensed Lankhmar setting many years ago. Goodman Games continued that heritage by publishing our own DCC Lankhmar setting in 2019. The Greatest Thieves in Lankhmar is part of the DCC Lankhmar line of products, officially licensed by the estate of Fritz Leiber.\nThe Greatest Thieves in Lankhmar was first run as our Gen Con 2019 tournament adventure. Goodman Games has been running RPG tournaments at Gen Con for more than a decade, and this year we are expanding even further to accommodate more than 500 players at Gen Con 2020. We are proud to continue a Gen Con tournament tradition that traces its heritage to the earliest days of TSR D&D tournaments.\nThe tournament is a true test of skill, for both judges and players alike. Under Gen Con conditions, each round is timed. At home you can play without a time limit, should you choose. But even without a time limit, the puzzles are challenging and the encounters are deadly!\nThe DCC RPG horde gathers for the tournament awards ceremony at last year's Gen Con!\nAt Gen Con, the Gong of Doom is used to sound the start of each tournament round. As PCs die, their players must make the Walk of Shame to sound the gong. This symbolizes the crack of thunder as their gods call home the souls of the fallen. The Gong of Doom is adorned with plaques to commemorate the winners of each annual tournament. When it is unveiled at Gen Con 2020, it will feature a new plaque with the names of the 2019 winners: Team Oh, God! with players Jim Batka, Mathew Batka, Joe Batke and Jason Cefaratti. If you\u2019ll be at Gen Con, make sure to visit our game area to see the Gong of Doom! And if you play at home, you may even want to get a gong of your own.\nThe Gong of Doom!\nOne of the most exciting parts of this publication is that everyone in the world can play the same adventure at the same time, and then compare their scores! At a certain stretch goal level (see below), we will add the International Tournament of Thieves.\nWhat is the International Tournament of Thieves? It is your chance to immortalize your home group!\nAt this stretch goal, we will work overtime to distribute a beta PDF of The Greatest Thieves in Lankhmar to backers. Once you have the beta, you will have several weeks to review it and schedule your home game. We will then set up a format where you can report your scores and submit a photo of your home group. The finished print product will then be updated to include your home group\u2019s names, score, and possibly their photograph (space permitting). This is your chance to be part of an international tournament, and see your home group in print!\nThe Gen Con 2019 Tournament Champions and the greatest thieves in all Lankhmar. When you play the adventure at home, can you out-score them?\nThe Greatest Thieves in Lankhmar is available in print and PDF formats. There is a consolidated pledge level containing the Lankhmar printed items and Lankhmar-specific add-ons. This is available for $250, a $20 savings on the individual purchase price. \nA similar PDF edition, featuring all the electronic Lankhmar items, is available for $130, a $12 savings. The PDF edition has the same content as the print edition, but of course no physical box. \nShipping costs are not included in the initial pledge levels. These will be assessed after the Kickstarter. Please note that this will be a weighty boxed set. USA shipments can go via affordable media mail, but international shipments may be expensive. If you'd like an estimated shipping cost, please message us. \nThese add-on items are included in several of the pledge levels, at a discount when purchased as a bundle. Check the pledge levels first!\nDCC RPG Core Rulebook ($40). Don\u2019t own DCC RPG yet? You can add on your own copy here!\nLuck Tokens ($40). Since first launching DCC Lankhmar, we have had constant requests for Luck tokens. These are used for the Fleeting Luck mechanic in DCC Lankhmar, which allows luck to be given \u2013 and taken away \u2013 live at the tabletop. For the first time outside of a convention, we will be offering Luck tokens for sale! There are a number of new designs, which you can see in this update. As an add-on to this Kickstarter, you can add a tube of 40 Luck tokens for $40.\nTournament Supplies ($20). At Gen Con, all judges receive a printed scoring sheet for each round, and each player receives a printed player pack. The boxed set includes a player pack and judge\u2019s scoring sheets, designed to be photocopied for home use. If you would like to run a larger tournament (or just have fancier materials for your home group), you can add on a set of tournament supplies. This includes five printed player packs and three extra sets of printed scoring sheets. (You can add on multiple sets if you'd like to run a lot of tournaments.)\nDCC Lankhmar Boxed Set ($60). You can add on the DCC Lankhmar boxed set for $60.\nDCC Lankhmar adventure modules ($10 each). There are 11 DCC Lankhmar adventures. You can add them on at $10 each. These are:\nDCCL#1: Gang Lords of Lankhmar\nDCCL#2: The Fence\u2019s Fortuitous Folly\nDCCL#3: Acting Up in Lankhmar\nDCCL#4: Violence for Votishal\nDCCL#5: Blasphemy and Larceny in Lankhmar\nDCCL#6: Cheating Death\nDCCL#7: A Dozen Lankhmar Locations\nDCCL#8: The Land of Eight Cities\nDCCL#9: Grave Matters\nDCCL#10: Unholy Nights\nDCCL#11: Rats of Ilthmar\nOther tournament modules. You can add on our previous Gen Con tournament modules. Riders on the Phlogiston ($30) was our 2018 Gen Con tournament, and The Black Heart of Thakulon The Undying ($20) was our 2017 Gen Con tournament.\nThe great thing about a boxed set is you can fill it with lots of stuff! We have big plans to expand this project if the fates and our fans support it. These include a bonus adventure Dicing With Death (which lets PCs keep playing as shades after their death in the tournament), upgrades to handouts and the poster maps, more encounters, and the International Tournament of Thieves! Join us on our flight through Thieves' House and let's make it happen! \nOur Gen Con tournament would not be possible without a dedicated team of incredible judges. Here is our shout-out and thanks. These judges will make your game a blast. They will also probably kill you. If you get the chance to game with them at Gen Con, do so!\nMike Bolam\nMarc Bruner\nEric Daum\nTim Deschene \nJeff Goad\nAaron Koelman\nTerry Olson\nHaley Skach\nJim Skach\nHarley Stroh\nJames Walls\nThe Greatest Thieves in Lankhmar adventure was originally conceived by Harley Stroh. Harley and Marc Bruner were lead designers on the project. \nOur design process for tournament adventures is centered around an overarching plot design, supported by a hyper-focus on making each encounter unique and special. Each person in the dungeon design team focuses their energies on just a few encounters, which gives each and every encounter in the adventure its own extraordinary feel. \nThe final dungeon design included contributions from writers Julian Bernick, Michael Bolam, Bob Brinkman, Alasdair Cunningham, Eric Daum, Tim Deschene, Marzio Muscedere, Terry Olson, and Thorin Thompson.\nHarley Stroh first ran Keep on the Borderlands for his brother and their parents at the age of eight. Since then he has published nearly 50 adventure modules, short stories, campaign settings, and gaming supplements, and has written for Goodman Games, Wizards of the Coast, Dave Arneson\u2019s Blackmoor, and the Hobonomicon. He eagerly awaits the release of Dungeon Crawl Classics #100: The Music of Spheres (is Chaos) and is hard at work writing adventures for Goodman Games\u2019 Dying Earth and Empire of the East lines, as well as contributing to David Baity\u2019s Dark Trails RPG. But, in his heart of hearts, he really just wants to write an adventure worthy of a Doug Kovacs cover. When not missing deadlines for Goodman Games, Harley is falling down on concrete at the nearest skatepark, or is broken down in the desert in a VW bus, with his family and their dog.\nMarc Bruner first contributed to Goodman Games as author of the 2016 Holiday DCC module Twilight of the Winter Solstice, and since then has gone on to pen adventures for DCC RPG, MCC RPG, and Dinosaur Crawl Classics along with the occasional web site article. He has also served as the co-designer for the DCC Open tournament held at Gen Con since 2017, helping to guide hundreds of players to their doom within the dark tombs of the multi-verse. He is currently lead designer on DCC Dying Earth, a setting for DCC RPG based on the works of Jack Vance and licensed from the estate of the author. When Marc isn\u2019t gaming or writing, he runs amok with his four kids and paramour in lovely Austin, TX.\nJulian Bernick cut his teeth on AD&D at the tender age of 13 and spent the next ten years balancing obsessions with D&D and comic books.  He lives in South Minneapolis, where he co-founded the Minneapolis DCC RPG Society with Judge Gary Fortuin. In addition to freelance writing for DCC, MCC and Umerican Survival Guide, he is the annoying voice on the Spellburn podcast, dedicated to DCC and old-school gaming. He\u2019s also a poetry editor for Whistling Shade magazine and has published poems in journals and anthologies, with his first book-length publication, Castle Bash, scheduled for 2020.\nMike Bolam first discovered D&D by playing a neighbor's copy of the Dungeon! board game in the early 80s. After playing RPGs occasionally through high school, Mike really jumped back into gaming in the mid-2000s, just in time for the resurgence of old school style play. He has been regularly running DCC RPG games since the Road Crew kicked off in 2013, and has been a DCC RPG Open Tournament Judge at Gen Con from the start. When he isn\u2019t gaming, Mike can usually be found watching pro-wrestling or playing with his death metal band, Abysme.\nBob Brinkman is the author of Blasphemy and Larceny in Lankhmar, and has written for DCC, DCC Lankhmar, DCC Dying Earth, MCC, and Fifth Edition Fantasy. He is the husband of ENnie award winning podcaster Jen Brinkman, and a tax professional, but he\u2019s also been a stable hand, swordsman, bouncer, fire-breather, and professional pirate. Having played RPGs since the days when everything was digest-sized and beige, Bob delights in writing adventures where a shadow of the past darkens the present. In his spare time Bob does things like record the G.G. Joe theme song and run the annual Cyborg Commando tournament at Gary Con. He and his wife live with their four cats: Asimov, Etta, Harlan, and Vance.\nAlasdair Cunningham has been playing role-playing games and their ilk for more than thirty years. Alasdair is a longtime writer for GCT Studios and has written for Chaosium and several other role-playing game publishers over the years. Born in Scotland but raised in South Africa, he resides in majestic Cape Town with his family where he spends his days surrounded by books, hordes of unpainted miniatures, and mounds of dice. He writes in a garden shed with a view of Table Mountain.\nEric Daum has been involved in gaming as a major part of his life since older cousins sat him down at age ten with the D&D Red Box. His deep connection to role playing continues to fuel his creative passions including art, writing, worldbuilding, and music-making. His guiding principle for adventure design is this: it\u2019s the game that brings people together but it\u2019s the story that keeps them there.\nTim Deschene got his start in gaming in 1983 when his dad bought him Strongheart and Warduke figures. Since then he has shown a proclivity for wearing armor exclusively on one side of his body. He is publishing zines for DCC and other old school games, as well as writing conversions of OSR adventures to DCC. He lives in Rhode Island with his wife, two daughters, and their pets Lulu and Prismo.\nMarzio Muscedere began gaming in the fourth grade when his best friend landed the D&D red box. And yet, despite many a year spent gaming, things that should not have been forgotten were lost. And for time uncounted the hobby passed from his knowledge. Until, as chance would have it, DCC emerged, and like the poisonous gleam of a forbidden jewel enticed him back into the hobby. Since then he has been the honored recipient of the Rodneys Design Award and has authored adventures for Goodman Games and Purple Duck Games. When Marzio is not locked away in his scriptorium he can be found shuttling his children to sporting events or in the ring training and coaching boxing.\nTerry Olson had his first foray into the arcane with Holmes the Blue. For two-score years after those studies, he\u2019s practiced skullduggery, alley-bashing, and patron-pleasing in various librams, labyrinths, and unmentionable libido\u2026but still hasn\u2019t found the right blend of white and black magic. As an agent for Goodman Games, he\u2019s traveled to the Purple Planet, Trapsylvania, Nehwon, Barako, and places where even Ningauble is forbidden. When he isn\u2019t mercilessly slaying PCs who dare to challenge his tournament encounters, Terry designs spinning magnetic disks that reside in clouds and act as storage for memories, grimoires, and things beyond his ken. He enjoys wining, dining, and watching movies with his wife and discusses adventure design with his canine and feline familiars, Dixie and Venki.\nThorin \u201cSonOvThrain\u201d Thompson is a Bibliophile, Cat-Lord, Word-smith, and Wizard! He has always and forever shall be a big ol\u2019 nerd! Growing up in his father\u2019s comic shop, he was molded at a young age by the arcane energy found within all tabletop RPGs, but it was the discovery of DCC RPG that allowed that magic to blossom! Now as the owner/writer of Owl Knight Publishing he seeks to make his mark! When not slaying demons upon the rim of the multi-verse, Thorin can be found on set, working on a multitude of television shows/movies, or enjoying a quite night of reading with a fine bourbon and a sleepy cat companion.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGoodman Games has run dozens of Kickstarters and fulfilled them all.

This year we are aiming at converting our Gamers & Grognards Octhorrorfest material into an Old-School Essentials compatible zine! This will include several of the classic articles and a few new ones, cleaned up and in line with OSE! Along with that, we will be bringing back our previous stable of artists to give you new and ghoulishly delightful art, as well as some new faces! So, what are we including in the material at the get go?\nThe Witch - New OSE Class\nNew spells for the Witch\nRitual Magic Rules for the Witch and existing spell casters\nThe Witch Hunter - New OSE Class\nBlobs - New Monster\nHorla - New Monster (featured in Hidden Hand of the Horla)\nThe Elder Sign: Turning the Outer Dark\nPossession, Obsession and Exorcism Rules\nCuring Vampirism\nIn addition to these, if we fund, stretch goals will be added for new material. Further more, you will notice we have a limited number of spots open for the \"I Dig Monster Movies\" tier. At this level, you can request a full write up of your favorite movie monster. This can be a horror/monster movie monster, or any creature from an appropriate B-rated flick. If you back at the \"I Dig Monster Movies\" tier, you will be able to suggest exactly what you think the creature should be able to do, based upon the film it is featured in. Each monster will be illustrated as well. What you pay for at this level is the writing, editing and art for the creature you would like to see brought to OSE. Obviously we cannot violate IP, so if you want \"Michael Myers\" we might be able to settle on creating a \"Masked Eternal Killer.\"\nZines will be printed on the same high quality paper as our previous zines, with an orange cardstock cover.\nOur Artists:\nDiogo Nogueira\nDiogo Nogueira is the owner of Old Skull Publishing, Diogo has published Sharp Swords & Sinister Spells, Solar Blades & Cosmic Spells and Dark Streets & Darker Secrets, amongst other games.

It will be an 8.5x11\" format delivered in PDF. The expected page count is 25-32. Printed rewards for Real-Life Swabbie and Real-Life Pirate Player rewards will be 8.5x11\" printed format with notes by the game runner and signatures of the 2 Old Guys and the players if they so choose to sign it. OK, on to the fun!\nCompatible with DCC RPG\n We're on a Boat!\nCaptain Guido: \"Ain't never met a paying customer I didn't like. So what if their faces were hidden in the cowls of purple robes with weird gold lettering around the cuffs and hem. Sure, maybe a tentacle slithered out of one of those cowls...but their coin passed the bite test, so I took it, and their smelly, slimy crates.\"\nMr. Skubagai, First Mate: \"If the Cap'n had asked, me, I'd have told him that taking on cargo of an illicit nature with a ship full of landlubbers was a bad idea, but when's he ever consult his first mate? And, why are all those crates leaking some sort of ichor?\"\nQuartermaser Warklaw: \"You even sail, bro?\"\nCaptain: \"Yes. I mean, I did just win this ship in a card game from a guy in a cape...\"\nBig Booty Boat by Domille's Wondrous Works. Used with permission.\n We've sailed! Well, not a project via Kickstarter...\nA Barnacle-Laden Salty Funnel is a twist on nautical adventure themes. We'll forego all the Aye Mateys and Avast Ye Scurvy Dogs! This is the first in what we hope becomes a series of funnels we produce that have a multi-theme angle to them. We filled 3 Occupations tables (Christophor said that's a pain in the @ss but he's now a master of medieval jobs), took three standard nautical themes and then twisted them into a single product. This gives better replayability as well as some options in each play through. Choose from a cargo hold full of soon-to-be-slaves, a brig full of criminals, or a ballroom full of pompous a... elites.\n The Themes\nPrison Transport\nAfter a rather hurried and unpleasant trial, you were jailed, trussed up like a pig going to slaughter and then carted off to the docks.\nYes, you can guess the rest. Stripped of gear, slapped in a cage, deprived of food and drink... blah, blah, blah.\nSlave Trader\nAs soon as you wake, you wish you hadn\u2019t. There's crusted blood on your face and a knot on the side of your head. On top of that, the ground keeps moving to and fro making you want to heave up anything that might remain in your stomach.\nThe really unfortunately thing is, they're chained to the floorboards!\nHigh Society\n\"A gilded invitation to take a jaunty three-hour tour with the rest of society's elite? It's all about hobnobbing with the snobbiest so I piled on my finest finery and my excessively ornate accoutrements...\" \nYeah, that was always going to end badly. Three-hour tour? Just asking for trouble!\nThen, of course, the ship sinks. Unfortunately, for them, there's a band of armed growling guards/savage slavers/recalcitrant retainers in their way.\nQuartermaster Warklaw: \u201cBut little did they know escaping the frigid waters of the sinking ship was the least of their problems...\u201d\nIndeed. Because, it's Worse. Something Just Moved Past My Leg...\nWhen Tentacles Attack!\nSure, more Star Wars references than you can throw a belaying pin at along with some other pop culture riffs. Reading an adventure as the Judge shouldn't be a mindless, dry thing.\nIf players survive thus far, then they get to...\nFloat Away with the Rest of the Garbage!\nBut we didn't stop there. In scene 3 we included another crazy plot twist that we think everyone will enjoy as it embraces the weirdness of the DCC RPG mindset... pirates! Oh? Not weird you say? Pirates from the Aether! \nThat enormous, unknown space between the orbs of reality... is traveled by pirates. Pirates who have literally decimated an island when their massive Aethership crashed into it making it a hellscape crater, but what other choice have the PCs got? Plus, these squid-faced creatures have probably taken over some of their friends and are using them as new crew members. The question then becomes? Save them, or loot their corpses for wondrous, shiny, magical contraptions?\nFirst Mate: \"Wait, is this like in Aliens where their stomachs explode?\"\nCaptain: \"No, more like Scanners, where it's their heads that explode...\"\nQuartermaster: \"Gross, I'm going to have to clean that up, aren't I?\"\nFirst Mate: \"Not it!\"\nCaptain: \"Have one of the other crew do it.\"\nQuartermaster: \"There is no other crew.\"\nCaptain: \"Oh, well... Not it!\"\nQuartermaster: \"Dammit.\"\nUntil, finally, they're washed ashore. \nCommissioned art by Rachel Maduro. The Aether Raider.\n Unknown: \"I'm not saying it was aliens... but it was ALIENS!\"\nWhy Kickstarter\nWe are using this Kickstarter as a way to generate some \"seed capital\" so that we can create bigger, better products in the future. A Barnacle-Laden Salty Funnel is already written and we're taking the campaign time to fine tune, playtest, and get art in place. We're not skimping on the details, but we are aiming for a low cost point for backers yet have to ensure we can cover the expenses in the end. If things go extremely well we've got some simple, yet interesting stretch goals in the works to thank our backers for getting 2OG off the ground. The goal is a nearly all-digital campaign, but there are some tiers with a few slots for physical rewards, especially if you're heading to Gary Con XII\nCombined, Christophor & Michael have over 50 years of tabletop gaming experience. Christophor is teaching the next generation of gamers already via his Kids' D&D sessions in Milwaukee and some of the adventures we will release were first played by them. See our other events at Gary Con XII, and Gen Con 2020. Plus, Christophor is Judging for Goodman Games tournament at Gen Con this year, so he might kill your characters a few times by 2021.\nThe Stats\n4 New Occupation Tables\n3 New Weapons\n4 New Creatures\n24 new items\nNautical themed character sheets\nDozens of witty computer interjections\nHigh resolution maps for VTT or personal printing\nThe Team\nArt\nWarklaw - Maps, character sheets, other\nRachel Maduro - Aether Raiders, other\nDomille - Ship maps\nAstralArts - judge's screen\nWriting\n Christophor Rick\nMichael Spredemann\nStretch Goals for The Salty Funnel\n $750 - UNLOCKED - Nautical themed character sheets (2 variants!) We already started working on these and have some options in the works. These will include a full-page character sheet and a traditional 4-per-sheet DCC 0-level character sheet.\nCharacter sheet preview.\nUNLOCKED $900 - NEW THEME - A new Pirate crew! Play beside, or as, Captain Guido, 1st Mate Skubagai and Quartermaster Warklaw. The theme will include a new occupation table, new story content and pre-generated characters for the three top officers which can be used as PCs, or as noteworthy NPCs for the other themes.\nWe couldn't actually do a nautical adventure with multiple themes and NOT have actual pirates, could we? I mean, we were going to try, but well... the outpouring of support and backing changed that. \nUNLOCKED $1000 - New Handcrafted Character Sheet - Warklaw is a master of the visual arts whereas I am a master of the written word...or at least a really experienced journeyman. When we started discussing character sheets he whipped up some amazing art and we decided that his version would be its own goal...because it's pretty damned amazing. \nWarklaw's Fabulous Handcrafted Character Sheet (rough sketch sneak peek)\nUNLOCKED $1100 - Two New sea creatures Sometimes, adventures focus on adversity and obstacles. After all,  struggle is the essence of drama and adventure. However, there are also  super cool things that could show up or happen that are good for the  players. With this stretch goal we are doing both. We'll add in two new  sea creatures, one that is potentially helpful and one that is  potentially deadly. \nUNLOCKED $1200 OR 100 FOLLOWERS ON TWITTER OR FACEBOOK - Print on Demand After much discussion, and hand wringing and research we have decided that Print on Demand is something that we are prepared to offer. Well, not exactly prepared, but we can't learn if we don't do it. Therefore, at $1200 (or the new social media goal) we will open up ways to join the POD... you know, like a group of whales? ARRR! \nUNLOCKED $1300 - High Resolution Maps for VTT or Personal Printing While some play in person, others play online. We're trying to cater to  as many as we can. That said, we will include high resolution maps so  they can be dropped into popular online TTRPG platforms and still look  good and remain usable. This also means they'll be good for printing on  your own if you so choose. These will be packaged in a separate PDF and  come with all PDF tiers. There will not be a POD option for these maps.  We have a large stack of DCC modules and most of them just offer inline  maps. We wanted to make sure they we gave more options in this area as  recreating the maps and making them look good can be time consuming for  already busy Judges.\nUNLOCKED $1500 A Collection of Sea Shanties for Backers We previously mentioned something about sea shanties. Well, we have a musically talented friend who is whipping up some bawdy sea shanties. We don't have tons of information as of yet, but we are striving to nail down some details before we cross the next stretch goal. This unlocks at $1500.\nUNLOCKED $1750 Item & Creature Cards The items and creatures in the Salty Funnel will be broken out into easy to manage reference cards. These can be used to better organize while running the game. \nUNLOCKED $2000 Judge's Screen This screen will display an epic scene painted by a Milwaukee area artist specifically for The Salty Funnel and 2 OG Games. The judge's side will feature useful tables, and information as one would expect. We are looking into POD options for this which might just be an early access, discount price thing instead of a new reward tier.\nUNLOCKED $2250 Two New Player Classes Two new classes that tie directly into the story, items and creatures in the Salty Funnel. Totally unique and aimed at continuing the fun beyond Level 0.\nUNLOCKED $2500 Additional Mini Adventure Speaking of beyond Level 0! A mini Level 1 adventure that picks up right where your group might have left off at the end of the Salty Funnel. Just as a way to get your campaign moving from the end of the Funnel out into the wide open world around you.\nYou overachiever!\nHoly cats! You're still reading? Did you get repetitive stress syndrome of your mouse finger scrolling this far down? Well, there's nothing to see down here... OK, there is!\nCollectively, Christophor and Michael have backed over 350 projects on Kickstarter and help support the community as much as they can. It helps create a diverse ecosystem of game-expanding content and drives the hobby they both love toward an ever-brighter future.\nThe Small Print\nRules Set: DCC RPG, an OGL system that cross-breeds Appendix N with a streamlined version of 3E.\nSupport: Goodman Games supports DCC RPG with an extensive line of adventure modules and select other materials.\nThis product is based upon the Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game, published by Goodman Games.

They don\u2019t use that name much anymore, preferring to talk lazily, and skip letters. In strange accents, often misheard and little understood by those outside of the central region - they call it \u2018The Midderlands\u2019, and themselves \u2018Midfolk\u2019 or \u2018Midderlanders\u2019.\nEverywhere though, the Midderlands is tainted by a green-tinged menace that rises from \u2018Middergloom\u2019, the deep and mysterious realms beneath the surface. It affects nature and order. Sometimes subtly and sometimes catastrophically. Middergloom is often described as hell bathed in green fire and flames. Green-tinged, viscid slime; noxious, acrid vapours, and miasmas of hopelessness creep upwards from below. Amongst them, viridian-coloured demons, lime-green tentacles and other malachite horrors claw their way to the surface to wreak havoc. The Lords of the land are always working to keep things at bay. They fight endlessly as if holding back a torrent of despair.\nThings stir in this viridian-hued landscape. Evil eyes blink and watch. Teeth and claws scratch and sharpen. Gaping maws slobber and drool.\nAll is not content in the Midderlands.\nFinal design subject to change.\nTHE MIDDERLANDS 5E BOOK INCLUDES:\nCreatures\n25 Fully-detailed creatures\nEach creature provided with an NPC version.\nSome creatures include rules for using as playable races.\nA large poster hex map of The Midderlands\nDetailed geographic setting information\n29 Fixed hex descriptions\n3 Random hex descriptions\n16 Hamlets (5 mapped)\n11 Small towns (3 mapped)\n8 Large towns (5 mapped)\n25 Points of interest\nInformation on currency, effects of gloomium, gods, and the dialect.\nNew layout and many pieces of new artwork\nNew cartography from ENnie Award-winning cartographer, Glynn Seal.\nAdventure\n1 Short introductory adventure\n6 Adventure ideas\nLoads of \u2018game-juice\u2019 to get your ideas flowing.\nOddities\n4 Flora\n13 Fauna (including birds, fish, bugs, and more.)\n5 Spells\n13 Items\nAppendices\nTables of names\nTables of \u2018Crap You Find On Midfolk\u2019\n Free Midderlands Taster <-- click here for 8 pages of the Midderlands\nThe Midderlands 5e\nThe Midderlands is an award-winning, weird world-setting for fifth edition (D&D). It\u2019s late middle ages/Tudor England seen through a looking glass, filled with strange creatures, insidious threats, and the color green. It\u2019s edgy, it\u2019s twisted, and the first thing you should expect is the last thing you\u2019d expect. Looking for a 5e setting completely different from anything you\u2019ve seen before? You\u2019ve found it \u2013 now let\u2019s see if you can survive it\u2026\nSample image of The Midderlands 5e cover\nWords from the Author\nThe Midderlands exists because of a series of fortunate thoughts.\nIt was mid-late 2016 and often I would go around to my partner\u2019s house on the evenings and whilst she sat on the sofa watching the television, I doodled the heads of strange creatures in side profile.\nI had no plan for these doodles, but I had a sketchbook and I wanted to fill quite a lot of it. As I doodled, I imagined that these creatures might live in the surrounding lands where I lived. That gave them much more life. I then thought I could create a book of creatures with a little about where they live and what they do.\nThen I figured that rather than living in the land where I do now, why not an alternate version of where I live. It would be a bit weirder, darker, gloomier. I wanted something that made the land the way it did. That\u2019s when Gloomium became a thing.\nThe locations would be inspired by the real world, but twisted and green-tinged, so I needed a map. I made an alternative version and that\u2019s when I decided this was a game setting.\nMap of the Midderlands\nThe creation of the initial setting book for old school games \u2013 the 5E version of which is being crowdfunded here \u2013 spawned another book which covered the rest of the United Kingdom, and then a further book which focused on the setting\u2019s version of London, Great Lunden.\nSample page from The Midderlands 5e\nI have been amazed with its success and wanted to bring a version of the original to the 5E audience, so they too could enjoy wandering its twisted locales and encounter its unusual creatures. I just wasn\u2019t sure how to achieve it.\nLuckily, the kindly amphibians at Necromancer Games came to the rescue and we are now in a great position to bring a new version of the setting to you. My hands will be heavily involved in new and updated artwork and maps and a new layout.\nThis is going to be exciting and you won\u2019t want to miss out.\n\u2014Glynn \nNote: See even more of Glynn's work or purchase a copy of the Original Swords & Wizardry Midderlands titles by going to the MonkeyBlood Design & Publishing website at the link below.\nhttps://monkeyblooddesign.co.uk/\n\n\nMouselings will scurry home with a PDF copy of the Midderlands and its fabulous map.\nShort-horned Ratdogs get a nice chew toy for their lair\u2014a hardcover copy of the 5e version of the Midderlands and a folded poster map\u2014as well as a PDF copy of both.

It will be charged right before the rewards are shipped on our web page.\nSome changes from our previous Kickstarter projects\n1. We will NOT be using a pledge manager (like Backerkit) for this project. All pledges are locked when the project ends; we will not have a method to change your pledge reward after the project closes. You will however be able to purchase additional add-ons when you pay shipping (see below). The collector's book will not be available as an add-on.\n2. We will not be charging shipping until your rewards are packed. This leaves out guesswork and allows for maximum flexibility in selecting the carrier and packaging material for your reward.\n3. This project\u2019s rewards will all be shipped priority mail (or equivalent) to domestic and international backers.\nNote to international backers\nWe continue to see cost increases and damage increases on overseas shipping. We cannot do anything about this. Likewise, some countries charge VAT tax or other fees to our customers on receipt. We cannot fraudulently lie about the value of materials we mail out. We have considered not selling books and games overseas due to the complaints about postage. That being said, we have a number of long term customers that we want to be able to receive our books if they do not mind paying the associated costs. However, we cannot give an honest shipping quote until we charge shipping because we just do not know the costs for future deliveries in every country. Be aware the overseas postage costs are not for the faint of heart!\nRefunds and replacements\nWe will happily ship your game anywhere you indicate on your Kickstarter survey provided that regular service is available from the USA (e.g., not to nations subject to trade embargoes or to other planets). If your rewards are damaged or missing after shipment we will replace the damaged or missing items.  However, we will NOT process refunds for unshipped items.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNecromancer Games is financially backed and owned by Frog God Games. Frog God staff will get this done.

A descriptor-based game prioritizes the descriptor over the effects. An effect-based game prioritizes the effects over the descriptor.\nAscendant strives to be neither a descriptor-based nor effect-based game. It is, rather, a physics-based game. The game mechanics are intended to be the physics engine of the game world. Powers have both descriptors and effects. Some effects are precluded by the logic of the descriptor, and some descriptors inevitably entail certain effects. The mechanics are elaborate and detailed (as in an effect-based game) but they are also broad and universalized (as in a descriptor-based game). Players are expected and encouraged to use their powers in whatever manner makes sense within the physics of a comic-book world, but not in ways that don\u2019t make sense.\nIf a descriptor-based system aims to let players experience a comic-book story, and an effect-based system aims to let players play a superhero game, our physics-based system aims to let players simulate a comic book world. To do so, we have created logarithmic chart-based universal mechanics, a style of design that has not been widely used in the last two decades, but which will be instantly familiar to fans of the classic FASERIP and MEGS RPGs from the 1980s.  \nLearning the Game  \nThe easiest way to learn about Ascendant is to get walked through a character stat block. Below is the stat block for Aurora. Previously a D-grade celebrity from a TV  reality show, her ambition to be a dazzling star in the spotlight was granted\u2026sort of\u2026 when she manifested the ability to control and generate light. Now she is one of the most famous ascendants in the world, with brand sponsorships from beauty and fashion companies, her own press team, and a prestigious membership in the Star-Spangled Squadron, America\u2019s premier team of crimefighting ascendants.   \nUp at the top you can see Aurora's Character Points, Power Limit, and Challenge Rating. Character Points (CP) are used to construct characters. An average human has 200 CP. A trained soldier has 240 CP. An exceptionally impressive, formidable and renowned human in the real world has 400 CP.  Every 80 CP represents an approximate doubling of the character\u2019s competency across all capabilities. With 940 Character Points, Aurora is one of the 20 most powerful superhumans in the world. Power Limit constrains how  characters can allocate their CP and is analogous to class level in a D20 RPG. Challenge Rating shows how powerful a character is relative to a trained soldier. Aurora can defeat 500 US infantry simultaneously - she's a tough woman.  \nOver on the right, below her image, you'll see Aurora's Primary Attributes: Might (MIG), Agility (AGI), Valor (VAL), Resolve (RES), Insight (INS), and Charisma (CHA). Each of these Primary Attributes are rated in Supermetric Points (SP). SP are logarithmic; each additional one SP has a value equal to double the amount of the previous SP.  Ordinary people have 3 SPs in each of their Primary Attributes, and the most impressive humans typically have no more than 5 SP in any Primary Attribute. With 7 SPs of Agility, Aurora is four times more agile than an Olympic athlete. With 12 SPs of Charisma, Aurora is 500 times more magnetic and alluring than any ordinary person.\nTo the left of the Primary Attributes are Aurora's Secondary Attributes, which rate factors like Initiative, Passive Spotting Range, Height, Income, and more. With a Flight Speed of 14 SPs, Aurora can fly at Mach 24!\nBelow the Variable Attributes we list Aurora's Powers. Her most important Power is Agile Light Control. Light Control is a pre-defined Power Set that allows her to emulate many other powers.  (The rules let you build your own power sets if you want, yes!)   \nThe word Agile in front of Light Control is a modifier that changes how the power works. In this case, it means that Aurora uses her Light Control in conjunction with her Agility rather than her Insight. Between Powers, Power Sets, and Modifiers, there are infinite possibilities available to make virtually any character you can imagine.\nBelow Powers we've listed Aurora's Skills. Skills can be substituted for Primary Attributes for specific purposes. For instance, Aurora has 14 SPs of Aerial Combat. If she's the target of a ranged attack while she's flying, she can substitute her Aerial Combat score for her Agility score, making her much harder to hit. \nBelow the Primary Attributes, you can see Aurora's Perks and Drawbacks. Perks function similarly to Feats in a D20 RPG. Some of the most important Perks are the Combat Maneuvers, which allow you to trade damage for accuracy and vice versa. Aurora's got two Combat Maneuvers as well as a host of other Perks related to her status as a celebrity member of the elite Star-Spangled Squadron.\nAurora has a number of minor Drawbacks such as her Code of Honor (\"always be fabulous\") as well as one very serious Drawback called a Vulnerable State. A Vulnerable State models all the situations that can result in heroes becoming weaker or losing their powers. Exposed to meteorites from your homeworld? Caught out of your powered armor? Forgot to recharge your power ring? Not angry enough to turn green? All modeled with Vulnerable State. Aurora's Vulnerable State is that all of her powers are based on her egoistic desire to be a star; if she's ever reduced to 0 Determination, she gets depressed, loses her superpowers, and acquires a host of flaws. \nSpeaking of Determination, that's one of the game's Variable Attributes. The other one is Health, and both are listed near the top of the sheet. These are like Hit Points in a D20 Game. Unlike the other Attributes, Variable Attributes aren't rated in SP, just in raw numbers, so that when you deal and take damage it's all scaled correctly.\nAs for how the game itself works, it's so easy even a 200-CP ordinary human can play it! Anytime you want to make an Action, you choose your Action Value (AV) and then subtract the Difficulty Value (DV) to yield a Resolution Value (RV). You then roll 1d100 on the Challenge Action Resolution Table, or CHART, to see your Color Result. The CHART is carefully structured so that the expected values for any AV versus any RV are exactly what they ought to be, given the logarithmic nature of the Attributes.  (It's pretty slick if you like math and we'll update on this in more detail later.)   \nLet's simulate Aurora shooting a Thermal Blast at the blindsighted assassin Helen Killer. Down at the bottom of her sheet, we've listed Aurora's Attacks. Each Attack has an Action Value and a Base Damage. If Aurora fires a Thermal Blast at Helen Killer, her AV for the Attack is 14 SPs and her Base Damage is 256. Her DV for the Attack is Helen's Combat Sense, which happens to be 13 SPs. That gives Aurora an RV of 14 - 13 = +1 on the CHART. Let's say her player rolls a 32. Scanning across the \"1\" row of the RV (Attack) column, we see that 32 falls into the Yellow range, so Aurora has scored a Yellow result on her Attack. \nWhen you score a Green result when making an Attack, you deal Base Damage, while Yellow, Orange, and Red results increase damage by a factor of 2, 4, or 8. Since Aurora scored a Yellow result she deals 512 points of Damage to Helen Killer. Helen now gets to  apply Protection like Forcefield or Invulnerability, then Roll With the Attack to reduce Damage in exchange for taking on various Conditions like \"Dazed\" or \"Staggered\".\nWe'll discuss the rules more in future updates but if you want more details, be sure to check out the sneak preview of the game\u2019s first two chapters at the link below!   \nWhat if Superhumans Had Just Emerged?\nEnough about rules. Let's talk about setting! Ascendant includes an optional campaign setting inspired by comics like Watchmen, The Boys, Squadron Supreme, The Authority, and Invincible. The world of Ascendant  doesn't begin to diverge from that of our real world until 2012, and the first superheroes don't go public until the Battle of Atlanta in 2018, meaning your player characters will be among the first superhumans to ever don tights and fight crime.  The setting is presented as an epistolary novel made up of leaked documents, transcripts, newspaper clippings, and emails that you can print out and give to your players - like this one.   \nOf course, we also include statistics for all of the major characters and organizations presented in the backstory, too. If you're intrigued, be sure to download the sneak preview of the campaign setting by clicking on the image below.  (Art and layout not yet final!)   \nThe Art of Ascendant  \nComics are a visual medium and no comic book game should be without amazing illustrations. We\u2019ve secured a team of top comic book artists to bring the world of Ascendant to life. Here's some samples of the artwork we've already commissioned. With your support, there'll be lots more!   \nAIRBORNE faces STILETTO in a rooftop battle between hero and anti-hero\nHyperkinetic teleporter WARP confronts blindsighted assassin HELEN KILLER\nThe world's first (and only) ascended manatee, LEVITEE, visits NYC on his Goodwill Tour\nAURORA of the Star-Spangled Squadron is greeted by adoring fans\nPledge Levels  \nAre you ready to pledge?

However, in our last Kickstarter, we suffered a six-month delay. The causes of the delay were twofold. First, we added some additional material via stretch goals that took time to write. Second, we committed to full color art but only had one artist.

You run a game really well.\nWhat's the difference between a room and a chamber? What's the difference between a mausoleum, a sepulcher, and a crypt? Would disarming traps be more exciting if you understood how those complex mechanisms worked? What does a magic trap look like? What does a solar room look like and what's usually inside?\nDo you think it would be exciting if a classic group of fantasy artists got together and drew pictures of all these artifices, deceptions, and dilemmas for you to use as reference at your table with your group?\nI did.\nWhat's in it?\nCurious about the content? Check out the table of contents from the book. Want to see what's written? Back the project and read the art-free PDF that is available in the second backer update.\n In those sections there's information on different ways to describe dangers to the player characters, along with twists and turns, inspiring you to create your own rube goldberg mechanisms that the players can escape from. You already know how to make it fair and fun. \nThe book is written and an art-free version will be available to backers now. But I'd like to get a book like this illustrated.\nWhat are the details\nThis will be an approximately 200-page paperback. It will be lavishly illustrated. Behold.\n\nWho's involved?\nI reached out to Skullfungs, Karl Stjernberg who did the Beautiful cover to my first kickstarter, which delivered on time and to acclaim (over 1000 copies sold and a review score of 4.8) and he agreed to do the cover for this. I also need an editor, and the talented Sandor Gebei also agreed to come back and turn my text into something professional-like. \nKarl's Previous Cover\n\nThat's what the funding level of the Kickstarter covers. But I reached out to other people.\nMarcin S (Perdition, Against the Darkmaster), James Shields, Russ Nicholson (A Warlock on Firetop Mountain, Fiend Folio), and Steve Crompton (Grimtooth's Traps) have all agreed to do illustrations for this project. I'm chuffed, right? I'm not the only person who thinks getting art from these artists would be amazing.\nStretch Goals\nNow we have a chance to get more art from wonderful artists. This book is extensively illustrated\u2014nearly every single one of the page spreads of the book is illustrated.  Take a look at the draft copy in backer update 2, and check out the space devoted to art in the layout. With the work of the people below, Artifices, Deceptions, and Dilemmas will be a portal to an ink-carved realm of fantasy and mystery!\nWho am I?\nI'm an independent writer and artist, who's been producing gaming and gaming-\nrelated products for years. You've likely already read stuff I've written. My last kickstarter, On Downtime and Demesnes, funded on Kickstarter in hours and was released on time. People like it. My blog Hack & Slash has been popular for years; and since I've gone full time, my high-level module Eyrie of the Dread Eye has nothing but five-star reviews.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my second Kickstarter, but the draft of the book is written, the layout is complete. I have finished products like this dozens of times, and consistently receive astounding 4.5+ star ratings on my products.\n\nI've given myself more of a window this time, but I've worked with every single one of the artists (except Steve) before, and they've all turned in amazing work promptly. My expectation is that they will continue to be professional and produce on time. That said, Russ is very busy, which is why he requested a generous window. It is worth. \n\nI have a lot of experience working with DriveThruRPG to produce printed copies. I completed my last kickstarter on time. People received their copies on time.\nI don't suffer from depression, and I am a productive person who is online frequently. I'm here to work.

It always rains. Rain beats against the walls. It seeps through the shutters. It pours off the mossy backs of the gargoyles. It turns streets into streams and rivers.\nTeetering, damp towers lean against rotting townhouses thrown together in the ruins of a once gleaming city. Servants dash through storms on petty errands. Fireplaces sputter weakly, and spellbooks filled with moldy spells rot in spite of the protections lavished on them for their precious contents.\nA VISITOR'S GUIDE TO THE RAINY CITY is a system-agnostic RPG zine offering a complete setting playset and toolkit for GMs and players alike to mine for your own games and campaign settings or drop into a campaign as is. Spice up your roleplaying with the weirdness, whimsy, and wickedness of the Rainy City - a doomed fantasy metropolis at the end of the world - where the wizards jealously guard their rotting magical tomes, the gargoyles are always watching, the thieves are on the prowl, and the rains never stop.\nAs a GM Playset & Toolkit\nThe VISITOR'S GUIDE is designed for busy GMs to mine for your own games and campaigns. Need a flavorful but dour neighborhood to drop into a city you're prepping? Then use the paranoid and cult-infested Levee Town. Need a strange NPC wizard for players to sell their ill-gotten loot to? Oculam the Oracular is your wizard; he already saw you coming! Need a weird urban location to toss in front of your players? Then look no further because Vengus Ult's Mushroom Library has just sprouted up in Old Town. Need a colorful folktale to flesh out your local village? Then Ware the Winder Man, who comes every Mid-Winder Night to enter your home and steal your breath. \nBreak the VISITOR'S GUIDE down, mine it for gems, and use them as your own.  \nAs a Whole Setting\nGMs can also use the VISITOR\u2019S GUIDE as a complete, interconnected setting. The Rainy City can be dropped into the oceans of nearly any fantasy world, be found on the edges of the Elemental Plane of Water, or used as we use it -- as the last city left, where everyone and everything eventually washes up as world after world is destroyed by flood. Maybe it\u2019s a place your regular characters pass through on their adventures. Maybe it\u2019s a sort of Bermuda Triangle where they get stuck, for a while. Maybe it\u2019s a pocket universe, maybe a dream, or even some sort of hell. If you can think of a use for a magic rich, rain-soaked city with an Age of Sail flavor that could house any sort of fantasy, you can drop the Rainy City into your campaign.\nTake it, pair it with your favorite game, and make it your own. \nThe Wizards of the Rainy City - sometimes mysterious, often menacing, but always weird!\nInfluences and Look\nThe Rainy City is the brainchild of Rich Forest, who has been thinking about, developing, and running game sessions in the Rainy City for more than fifteen years now. This is a passion project for Rich, and it shows in the vibrant and evocative details inherent in the Rainy City as a setting and playset.\nThe setting's influences are varied. The influence of Jack Vance\u2019s Dying Earth books is obvious in the wizards, and we hope some of Pratchett\u2019s warmth and good humor can be found as well. Many touches inspired by folklore (especially folklore of the sea), the history of great cities (especially London, which has a lot written about it in English), and history and fiction about piracy and the Age of Sail have informed the place. Every game system it has been used with has left its mark, from Big Eyes, Small Mouth, to classic D&D, The Fantasy Trip, Castle Falkenstein, Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay, Mythras, and 5th edition.  \nThe look of the zine evokes the style of an early modern European pamphlet. As such, we're using Fell Type fonts throughout, and the interior art by Bill Spytma is in a style he's developed that emulates the kind of woodcut art you can see in those old pamphlets. \nFor a doomed city at the end of the world, the Rainy City is a vibrant, alive, and, well, weird place.\nWhat's in the Zine?\nWhat\u2019s included in the zine? Detailed descriptions, notable NPCs, evocative locations, and capsule adventure hooks for:\n The Eight Main Districts of the City: Vagabond Bay, Old Town, Levee Town, The Sump, The Mids, Embassy Row, The Headlands, and The Tower Cliffs (with Maps!)\n   The Peoples of the Rainy City, detailing some of the more exotic denizens of the city, such as Gargoyles, Ghouls, Gulls, Larvae, Mine Goblins, Mermaids, Ratkins, and Sump Boggies\n   The Pirates of the Rainy City, including their floating pirate haven of Rickety\n   The Guilds of the Rainy City, including spotlight focus on The Alchemists Guild, The Society of Thatch, and The Molten Men\n   The Four Seasons of the Rainy City: The Rainy Season, The Windy Season, The Quiet, and Firelight, plus the traditions, customs, and holidays associated with each.\n   The Wizards & Witches of the Rainy City, spotlighting such notables as Iambic Pentacular, whose watery double haunts the city; Antigone Graves, the VVitch of VVending Street; Hyperion the Hated; Oculam the Oracular; the Kandive, Agar Yaminnu; and the ever-changing and unchanging Sandestin.\n   The Patrons of the Rainy City, powerful and notable people in the city who need something and need divers, adventurers, and renovator to get it for them\n   The Gangs of the Rainy City, who prowl the flooded streets of the city carousing and causing trouble\nAnd much more! \nBonus Stretch Goal \u2014 Reached!!\nThe campaign also now includes a single stretch goal (the only one we will have). Upon reaching the $2000 funding level (which we did!), we will include for free a 11x17, quarter-folded poster of the Rainy City map for all backers at the Citizen reward tier! So not only will you get a map in the center of the zine, but if we reach this goal, we'll give you another one double the size to gaze at lovingly and plot out your Rainy City fun.\nMap of the Rainy City - which will be the centerfold of the zine!\nThe finished zine will be a 56-page, 5 \u00bd x 8 \u00bd, saddle-stitched booklet, printed w/ black ink. Interior pages will be on a beautiful ivory color (Cougar Natural), while the cover will be a heavyweight stock (in Haviland Blue). As writing and layout finishes up, the final page count could change. \nHaviland Blue Print Test - Not Final, but getting there\nCougar Natural Print Test - Not Final\nCougar Natural Print Test - Not Final\nIf you'd like to see a sample of the zine's content, we have posted sample previews on our website of Vagabond Bay and Tower Cliffs. Go check them out!\nPhysical copies will be mailed in a sufficiently-rigid cardboard mailer through the USPS for US residents only (shipping is free). Digital fulfillment will be through DriveThruRPG. If there is sufficient international interest, we can certainly explore print on demand through DriveThruRPG as well. \nBack Cover Mock Up - Not Final\nOnce we have successfully funded, we will push forward with completing the project on the following schedule:\n March/April: Finish Writing & Development, Final Art Pieces\n   May/June: Finish Editing, Proofreading, and Layout\n   July: Printing & Shipping\n  The Writer\nRich Forest really likes roleplaying games. He likes other things, too (stouts and porters, whisky, grilling, trail running, very snowy winters, and very rainy days), but, come on, roleplaying games! He spent much of his twenties and early thirties living outside the US (Germany, Japan, Hong Kong, and England), but he\u2019s settled in back home in mid-Michigan now with the love of his life and four children, a dog, and a rabbit. In his spare time, he\u2019s an English professor at Central Michigan University, where he mostly teaches linguistics. This one time, he wrote a whole book just about nouns.\nThe Artist\nBill Spytma is an illustrator, writer, painter, sculpter, carver and crafter. He\u2019s also an amateur folklorist chasing after Black Dogs and an armchair historian staying up late at night gazing into Odin\u2019s one good eye. He enjoys roleplaying games, funny costumes, sword fighting, and cold, snowy weather.\nThe Mapmaker and Editor\nAndrew Devenney\u2019s first exposure to roleplaying games was the Moldvay Basic D&D set, which he used to make an elf named Luke (after Skywalker, of course) when he was the ripe old age of six years old. To say he was hooked after that is a bit of an understatement. Married with spawn that looks eerily just like him at their ages, he currently resides in scintillating Mount Pleasant, Michigan, where he occasionally teaches students about stuff at Central Michigan University. Because he doesn\u2019t have enough to do, Andrew also co-writes and produces historical documentaries through his company, Stratigraphic Productions. He wears many hats. What\u2019s one more?\nThe Company\nWe founded Superhero Necromancer Games so that we could produce the kinds of games and settings we enjoy playing.

A few years ago I discovered the glory that is Dungeon Crawl Classics, and I immediately felt at home. DCC is dark and comical, and remains rooted in early D&D. It shows clear reverence to the metal that was the background for many of my gaming sessions in the 80's, and was the soundtrack to hours spent buried in RPG tomes or drawing dungeons. DCC speaks to me with the sweet lure of nostalgia while being something new and exciting at the same time.\nRabid Dogs is a collection of my home brew rules and encounters that exemplify the DIY spirit of DCC and my personal vision of a grim and dangerous fantasy setting. Each section of the zine is named after a punk song or album title that I connect with. The project was originally going to be called a variety of \"in game\" titles like The Outlier, or Dungeon Dogs of Stennard, but the passing of the drummer of Corrosion of Conformity, Reed Mullen, last month followed by original DRI bass player, Josh Pappe had me really thinking about my youth. Those two bands changed me in my teens as much as discovering B/X and AD&D did in third grade. I wanted to honor that impact, even it is just by mere acknowledgement.\nThe Contents:\nI'm an Outsider... The Outlier Character Class - The ranger concept just doesn't fit with the \"you're no hero\" ethos of DCC, and admittedly, I had a middle school obsession with the bandit character class for AD&D re-published in Best of Dragon Vol. 4. The Outlier mashes up these two concepts into something uniquely DCC.\nI Wanna Be Your Dog... The Canine Character Class - What happens when the party's shepherd dies and their herding dog becomes the heart of the party? Well, you probably should just let them be the fuzzy anti hero they were destined to be.\nEqual People... Demihumans and Mixed Race Player Characters - Unrestricted by traditions put forth by authors of the past, you should be the class and race you most connect with, and will have the most fun playing. Here's how to do that with DCC.\nRoad to Ruin... Three Roadside Encounters - A mysterious roadside statue, a philosophical wanderer, and a curious hilltop glade. Three encounters to test the wits of your band of adventurers.\nSewer Rat artwork copyright Richard Sampson (NerdGore), used with permission.\nWriting and Art Credits:\nAll of the writing was done by myself, Nick Baran.

Additional money will fund additional copies and possibly add some fun Stretch Goals. Anything above and beyond that will be funneled into future projects.\nStretch Goals:\n$850 Additional Four Pages: This will be an additional encounter, an additional piece of art, and if there\u2019s space, a new Occupation Table that takes race based occupations out of the mix, and adds canine occupations (because there are more working dogs out there than just herding dogs!)\n$1200 Cover Upgrade: Details to follow!\n$1800 Rabid Dogs Vinyl Sticker: Image to follow. \nDungeon dog art by Rich Sampson.

And those heroes who back at the $100 level will also receive not one, but two Roll20 sessions for them and their friends! That's about eight hours of entertainment for five people, coming to $2.50 per hour, per person -- and that's not counting all the lower rewards on top of that. \nAt $7000, I will create a dozen new fantasy ancestries and cultures! Each new ancestry and culture will be based on a mythological creature that you will want to play! We're still working on ideas, but right now we are considering bird folk, giantkin, goblins, lizard folk, cat folk, snake folk, shapeshifters, constructs, minotaurs, centaurs, satyrs, medusae, rat folk, mer folk, dryads, dhampir, werefolk, and more! Once we've created them, we'll release it to backers as a separate PDF released to all backers at the $5 and up level.\n Have you ever wondered why there are half-elves and half-orcs in your favorite fantasy roleplaying game, but not half-tieflings, half-dwarves, or half-gnomes? And why only allow orcs and elves to mate with humans and not others? Why can't we play the child of an elf and an orc or a gnome and a halfling? \nWhat's more, what if we want to play a human raised by elves, like Tolkien's Aragorn, or a halfling who grew up among orcs? Wouldn't such characters be different than a halfling who grew up among her own people, for example? It would be a delight to be able play such a diverse cast of characters, with such a wide range of ancestries and cultures. \nWell, now we can! This 32-page zine of rules and original fantasy art allows for the easy creation of a variety of new ancestral and cultural combinations and types, without having to make big changes to the core game rules. What's more, they replace the problematic concept of race as it is traditionally used in character creation. Ancestry provides those heritable traits a character might receive from their parents, such as height, average lifespan, and darkvision, and culture provides such teachable features as weapon training and ability. This frees us up to play the characters we want to play and provides us many more options, just dripping with role-play potential.\nIn addition to the new character creation rules, Ancestry and Culture also features original art by Talon Dunning and layout and art direction by Aaron Acevedo. Talon's art has featured in such games and properties as Legend of the Five Rings, Mage: The Awakening, Mummy: The Resurrection, Scarred Lands, Ravenloft, Kingdoms of Kalamar, Thieves' World, and Mutants & Masterminds, among others. Aaron's layout and art direction work can be found in almost every Savage Worlds product, including Savage Rifts and Deadlands, as well as in TORG, Unknown Armies, World of Darkness, The Yellow Sign, and more. \nHumans and their adopted orc brother\n Why replace the rules for Race in character creation for the world\u2019s most popular tabletop roleplaying game, you might ask? First of all, because it makes even greater characters, more interesting story, and richer role-play possible. Think of the possibilities of playing an orc-elf, or a gnome raised among dwarves, for example. And imagine what diverse communities might be like, where dwarven and elven culture, art, architecture mingle! What would their buildings look like? Their weapons? In short, we want to replace race with ancestry and culture because replacing it is easy and makes for more fun!\nBeyond that, there is a more serious reason to replace the concept of race in your games with ancestry and culture: simply put, because the very concept of Race in this game we love is problematic.\nFirst of all, the concept of race used in roleplaying games comes from the analogous concept used in the real world. Biologists, evolutionary theorists, anthropologists, and race theorists have long since shown that the concept as it was used at least from the Enlightenment forward to the 20th Century is, frankly, bogus. This is not to say there is no such thing as ancestry, heritage, and genetic difference, of course. But those differences simply do not map cleanly onto anything in our biology as simplistic as the concept of race, as it is often used. After all, none but the most flagrant racist in the real world nowadays would say that one\u2019s ethnic ancestry, or race, causes a person to have a lower intelligence or gives them a tendency toward extreme violence or evil, yet our fantasy games employ exactly this concept of race. In other words, race itself is a tainted concept, but the way it is employed in fantasy gaming is an exceptionally bad example. Thus I would prefer not to use it, if I can.\nA tiefling-gnome prepares for battle\nFortunately, it is not difficult to replace Race in character creation in our favorite roleplaying game. As I show in this zine, we can acknowledge that gnomes and elves and humans and dwarves might in general have certain biological markers that distinguish them, such as height and lifespan and darkvision, without also ascribing intelligence or weapon mastery or good and evil to their biology. Obviously, those features are more a result of upbringing than genetics. Why not therefore separate out biological ancestry from cultural heritage? That is exactly what I have done here!\nSome advantages of this are as follows: this separates the value-laden concepts of ability bonuses and alignment from biology; it locates skills, weapon proficiencies, languages, and other behavioral differences where they belong, in one\u2019s upbringing; and these rules do so in a way that leaves the rest of the game mechanics largely intact. Indeed, one should be able to swap out the Race options from character creation for these rules without much change elsewhere at all, though it may change the way the fantasy world is depicted (hopefully for the better). Further, using these rules also allows for a lot of fun new roleplaying opportunities, as you can now have mechanics to account for someone of one ancestry growing up among different cultures, such as a human raised by elves or a gnome raised among dwarves.\nAnd as we suggested, these rules even include ways to create characters of mixed ancestry and unique upbringing. In the original rules, one could create only half-elves and half-orcs (themselves problematic and human-centric \u2013 why not call them half-humans? And why only those two combinations?). With these rules, one can create characters with one human and one elf parent, to be sure, but also human-halfling, dwarf-elf, orc-tiefling, or gnome-dragonborn offspring if you like. Surely a fantasy world with magic and dragons, and one that already contains offspring of humans and elves and orcs, has room for halfling-dwarf children as well!  \nAn elf-tiefling\nHi!

Built for OSR Systems. Bonus compatibility for Dungeon World, 5E, and SS&SS!\nSpellsword is now on YouTube! Subscribe now to get sneak previews of the creation and progress of The Evils of Illmire.\nMy favorite types of adventure modules have always been the ones that provide not just a central plot, but also robust peripheral content to surround it. Adventurers will probably get involved in the main quest, but there are a lot of other things to keep them busy in the nearby areas too. Interesting creatures, locales, dungeons, and treasures abound in these types of modules. PCs are free to explore and meddle in a sandbox environment with many interactive parts. This is an attempt to capture that and mash it down into a digestible zine format that is actually useful and inspires the Game Master.\nProject Roots: The core concept and bulk of the ideas come from a classic 2nd Edition campaign I ran in the summer of 1997. I've since then revisited the content and added a number of other points of interest to create an adventure region stocked with dungeons, monsters, and treasures, all with an underlying sandbox plot that doesn't railroad. Traps are vicious and brutal. Adventurers will find classic +1 swords alongside a myriad of weird and interesting artifacts hidden in dangerous spots around the map. They'll clash with and flee from familiar monsters and a bunch of new creepy things.\nArt \u00a9 Stinky Goblin Emporium 2020\nAdventure Synopsis: A cult has begun to infiltrate to town of Illmire, spreading paranoia and terrorizing the locals with fear-mongering in order to feed their demonic idol. The cult worships an extra dimensional demon they found in some ruins in the nearby swamp. Lured by mysterious rumors of treasure out in the wilds, adventurers face an uphill battle against organized and fanatical zealots lead by vile, sorcerous clerics. They'll stop at nothing to further their diabolical schemes, and the people of Illmire will be crushed beneath their boot as they launch a campaign of torment and terror that will spread far beyond Illmire unless put to a stop.\nArt \u00a9 Stinky Goblin Emporium 2020\nProduct Features: This will be a 64-page zine, A5 format (5.5x8.5). It will contain a small hexcrawl with 19 distinct hexes, each with details and a wandering monster table. There is a map of the town of Illmire, as well as 15 detailed, one-page locations/dungeons. In addition, there is a bestiary for the adventure featuring some new monsters for adventurers to fight or run from. There is a simple weather system (so easy you'll actually want to use it!) to determine which hexes are experiencing rain, thunderstorms, floods, mudslides, blizzards, etc. There's awesome black & white artwork to help inspire terror. It's laid out in professional, clear, concise format meant to be quick and easy to use on game night.\nArtwork: The pages are graced with evocative artwork from Jack Badashski and Heather Shinn (Stinky Goblin Emporium). There is wicked cover art and a custom hex map that will be provided by Patrik Olsson. The dungeon cartography is by legendary mapper Dyson Logos. We've also brought on the illustrator known as HodagRPG as a spot artist for the character sheet, player handouts, and other neat little visual things that come with all pledge levels.\nCover art not finalized and may change\nShipping\nShipping is not included. You'll pay for shipping separately later. When the zine is ready to start shipping (estimated mid-April), we'll provide a coupon code for 100% off when you place your order, so you'll only pay for the shipping at that time. \nEstimated shipping costs:\nUS: $4.00\nCanada: $12.00\nEverywhere Else: $16.00+\n\nSTRETCH GOALS\nWe've hit our funding goal and went right on past it! Let's make this thing even more awesome! \n We hit $1000 in funding! We will have the hex map re-drawn by a talented artist to give it even more life and personality.\n We hit $1200 in funding! The booklet will gain a high quality, heavy stock cover with some truly wicked artwork that will make it look great in your zine stack.\n We hit $1400 in funding! The product will include a printable, hand-drawn OSR character sheet PDF to use with your Evils of Illmire campaign.\n We hit $1600 in funding! Evils of Illmire now includes a digital PDF guidebook you can print out to hand to your players as an introduction to Illmire. This'll be great for on-boarding adventurers and getting them in the right mindset (excited and terrified at the same time). \n We hit $1800! I'll add an optional second set of 4-panels to go inside of the Adventure's Guide, making it a total of 8 panels.\n We hit $2000! I'll add Module Reference GM Screen panels! The digital package will contain PDF files to print for use as inserts in the DriveThruRPG customizable GM screen. If you don't have one of these screens, no worries; just paper-clip the printed panels to an existing GM screen. \n We hit $2200! I'll add a second side to the custom character sheet to include extra space for notes and tracking conditions for your poor, poor adventurers.\n We hit $2500! I'll now add 4 additional pages to the 64-page zine; this means it'll be a 68-page zine. Three of these pages will be added to the Gazeteer of Illmire and will cover unique flora and fauna of the region; a few may be dangerous enough to warrant combat stats, but most will be either interesting to encounter or useful in some way. The final page will be a guide to crafting items using ingredients harvested from said flora and fauna.\n We hit $3000! Amazing! We'll now include pre-made characters so you can hop right into a game or hand them out as quick replacements for fallen adventurers. Prefer to make your own characters? Me too; use these guys as possible hirelings or a rival adventuring party!\n We $3500! The module will gain a separate expansion PDF that adds an Underdark area, including another dungeon! \n We hit $4000! I'll keep adding more art to make this zine gorgeous!\nNEW STRETCH GOAL!

This roughly 32 page A5 zine has everything you need to generate natural formations, forgotten ruins, enemies, wyrd magics, and ancient monstrosities. It has a simple turn-based combat system, rules for building your hold, and tips on how to implement your hold into your RPG world.\nInspired by games like Dwarf Fortress and Dungeon Keeper, DELVE aims to capture that feeling of building and protecting a fortress in an unforgiving subterranean world.\nAll you need to play is, a pencil, paper (preferably 1\" grid), and a deck of playing cards. \nThe Under-King has put out a bounty to all the holds demanding a Void Crystal, a rare and powerful gem found only in the deepest caverns. \nEach round your dwarves will mine another square of the grid, you draw a card from your deck of playing cards and see what they found. Hearts \u2665 and Diamonds \u2666 are resources and trade goods that you'll use for building and hiring units while Clubs \u2663 and Spades \u2660 are natural formations and forgotten ruins. From ancient libraries to goblin lairs, these subterranean locales will become part of your hold's unique layout and may provide unexpected benefits. Or you might just unleash a horde of ravenous insects in which case, you'll need to fight.\nCombat in DELVE is designed to allow for forward planning and strategic thinking without weighing you down with book-keeping. Essentially, all enemies follow the same goal of trying to reach the surface by killing their way through your hold. They can move one grid space per turn, as can all of your units. Once they get into combat, check the rock-paper-scissors style chart to see which group has the advantage and reduce each side by the STR of the other. \nOnce combat is over, it's time to build! As long as a room has access to the hold via a mineshaft or another room, it's good to go. Just pay the cost, and draw it in an available grid (empty or repurpose an old \u2663 or \u2660 grid space). At this stage, you'll also have the opportunity to build traps, reinforce, and hire units to defend your hold.\nJust, be careful as you get deeper though as the black joker is waiting. Drawing this card releases an ancient monstrosity, a randomly generated beast that needs a well stocked army and hold to defeat. \nThe Story of Blood Fate Hold\nThe hold was off to a rough start as their chosen site led straight into the lair of the mud goblin clan, Rushk. The initial group of soldiers sent with the expedition where wiped out in this surprise attack.\nDeciding that bad luck doesn't just strike once, they built a spike wall to defend their stairwell. A good choice as the next pick strike revealed a hive of cave wasps. Some miners perished but the overzealous wasps dashed themselves upon the spike wall.\nFinally, Blood Fate was started, a barracks built just beyond the hive. It's honey would sustain the expedition and our new soldiers would have somewhere to stay while the miners delved deeper.\nA string of good luck found trade goods and resources by the plenty and so they built a stewpot kitchen to hearten the fighting spirits of the soldiers, a shrine to bless their good luck, and finally, a stairwell to descend deeper.\nThe old adage of \"fool me once\" had become mantra for Blood Fate as they focused their efforts on defence. Rock fall traps on the stairwell, and a dead dwarf alarm that would warn of any approaching threat.\nTheir militaristic efforts where rewarded as after ignoring a buried temple (who knows what god it was built to), they broke through to a structure. A cavernous mansion filled with chandeliers, suits of armour, and a blood stained altar. A vampire queen's coterie. Her thralls poured from the shadows, overwhelming the miners and marching through the hold at their dark mistresses behest.\nThe boulder trap dashed the first zealous few on the stairs, weakening their numbers. The stew heartened soldiers fought bravely, managing to strike down all but one. The vampire queen herself. One soldier swore an oath to the gods and launched himself in a frenzy of spinning axes, injuring her before having his head torn from his shoulders. His sacrifice was not in vain however as his bravery bought the reinforcements called by the dead dwarf alarm time to arrive. \nBlood Fate Hold reeks of death and garlic, they say a fool is someone who doesn't learn from past mistakes and these dwarves are no fools. Every room is decorated in holy symbols to gods old and new and once a year the dwarves let blood in a rememberance ritual called Vampik.\nUNCOVERED - For passing \u00a31200 I'll pay an artist to make a better quality cover for DELVE. I'll also be creating a printable Unit Token sheet for use during combat and have upped the paper quality of the zine.\nUNCOVERED- At \u00a32000, pledges will also get a copy of RISE: A Solo Game of Spreading Evil (PDFS for all pledges, Print for \u00a37 and higher)\nRISE takes the DELVE engine and flips it on its head, putting you in the blood encrusted boots of a dungeon keeper as you build your dungeon, summon/grow/hire minions, and dig your way to the surface and your inevitable domination. Along the way you'll be challenged by powerful adventurers, other dungeons, and more. Will you be strong enough to keep your treacherous minions under control and defeat the forces of good? Or will you be overthrown and forgotten?\nYou will not have to pay increased postage for a physical copy of RISE\nUNCOVERED - At \u00a32600, pledges will get a copy of UMBRA: A Solo Game of Planet Colonisation (PDFS for all pledges, Print for \u00a37 and higher)\nAs a galactic war rages on, your government has tasked you with leading an expedition into the depths of an alien planet to find the source of a mysterious signal.

While we focus on DCC, the material produced can be easily translated into any Old School Renaissance (OSR) system.\nAfter playing in a session of DCC at Gary Con X in 2018, Brian and Trevor tossed around a few ideas to fix what they saw as some gaps in the rules; this was the germ of the idea that, almost two years later, led to the creation of Tales from the Smoking Wyrm. Contained herein are the stories and bits of knowledge that adventurers have shared around the hearth of the titular inn, and we hope that there will be many such tales for years to come! John and Joel decided they could lend their pens to the project, and so we had a writing team and one artist on time fully. After that Caitlin decided she could help out with the layout and design elements, so we had a cool looking product.\nThis latest kickstarter project picks up where we left off with issue #1 of our zine (currently shipping), with a whole new set of cool articles. Issue #2 goes deeper, explores further, and adds a lot for both players and judges!\n What's Inside?\nThe second issue will contain seven features, usable by both players and judges! Each article will be featured in greater detail in future Kickstarter updates so you have a good sense of what you will be getting, but here is a short list:\n King of Beasts as Patron\u2014Bonding with the wild side gives you distinct advantages!\n Dwarven J\u00e4ger\u2014A subclass of dwarf with a very useful skillset.\n Ritual Magic, Part II\u2014A close-up look at several rituals aimed at those of religious bent. Want to know why unholy creatures burst into flames when they cross the threshold into holy ground\u2014this will tell you, along with other mysteries.\n Culpepper\u2019s Herbal\u2014More herbs for your game. We continue building out an herbal catalog that all adventurers can take advantage of, even in the darkest of times.\n The Shoggoth\u2014A classic monster from deep in our adventuring subconscious finally flexes its full muscles! Also includes a Find Familiar spell for Cthulhu cultists to gain Shoggoth familiars!\n Wyrm Words\u2014A crossword puzzle of all the Gygaxian words in the second issue\u2014this way, a definition is never in doubt!\n Onward Retainer\u2014Starring the Legion\u2014The second installment of an adventuring comic in the old school style\n\nWhat You Will Get\nA tabletop RPG fanzine usable by players and judges\nDigest size (approximately 5 \u00bc by 8 \u00bc )\n40\u201344 pages (layout dependent; subject to increase with stretch goals)\nTwo-color interior\nArticles by: Brian Gilkison, Trevor Stamper, John Olszewski, and Jake Harmon\nArt by: Joel Phillips, Carmin Vance, Brian Maikisch, Alex Mayo, Bradley McDevitt, Caitlin Stamper, and Trevor Stamper\nPDF and Print on Demand (POD) versions of the second issue available (as per backing level\u2014not every level gets these items; POD must still be purchased at cost by those who support at that level)\nLimited Print Edition for Backers\u2014cover stock almost identical to the early 70s era supplements for Original Dungeons & Dragons (Eldritch Wizardry; Gods, Demi-Gods & Heroes; Swords & Spells), heavy paper interior meant to last for a long time; hand numbered for print backers (as per backing level\u2014not every level gets this item)\nSupport Levels\nShipping Costs\nWe will be using media mail for shipping. Each order will ship in a sturdy cardboard envelope via media mail. Per Kickstarter recommendations, shipping and handling costs ARE NOT INCLUDED IN PLEDGE LEVELS. At the time of launch, shipping and handling is planned to be an economical $5 per book shipped. Backers pledging over the tip jar level have the option to add that $5 per book to an existing pledge level.\nAll shipping for this Kickstarter is to the USA ONLY. We looked long and hard at shipping internationally, but the current prices for shipping outside the USA are just outrageous. It isn't that we don't want to ship to everyone, but the prices make it hard to justify (and would, in fact, be more than price of the product itself). Further, we cannot guarantee the booklet will arrive in good order once it leaves USPS hands. For these reasons, we simply cannot offer the limited edition product outside the United States.\nSTRETCH GOAL OVERVIEW\n$2,500 - UNLOCKED!

These also work great as ammunition counters for those players who won\u2019t tick off arrows! These were a hit with our last issue, and we will provide 5 more unique luck options on the back of this set!\nThese are the beautiful tokens from our first Kickstarter, as way of example for what the next set will likely resemble.\n$3,000\u2014Shoggoth Familiar bookmarks UNLOCKED!\nEveryone needs a lovable Shoggoth sidekick! Usable for those who patron Cthulhu, this bookmark will allow you to track your familiar's stats and abilities with ease. Laminated in a sturdy 5 mil lamination for extra durability. \nWho could resist a baby shoggoth as a familiar for your wizard patroness to Cthulhu?\n \n $3,500\u2014Four More Pages of Art UNLOCKED!\nAt this level, we can add 4 additional pages to the zine! We have so much we want to  share that those extra pages will give us the room to flesh out the articles even more with bold full page art. The extra pages will be available in all versions of the final product\u2014the limited-edition Riso print version, PDF,  and print-on-demand.\n$4,000\u2014Gatefold Cullpepper's Herbal pages UNLOCKED!\nAt this level, we will modify the Cullpepper's Herbal into a gatefold, continuing a trend we started in the Riso version of the first issue. This will provide us with additional space to expand the herbal article, adding rules for different ways to prepare herbal remedies in the game.\n$4,500\u2014Even More Art UNLOCKED!\nAt this level, we will add even more art to the zine!  We will find every crevice and add new art to the zine, cramming it full of wonderful illustrations in the DCC tradition! The extra art will be available in all versions of the final product\u2014the limited-edition print version, PDF,  and print-on-demand.\n$5,000\u2014Telepathic Rat 3D-printable miniature UNLOCKED!\nRemember what we said about everyone needing a telepathic sidekick back in issue 1? We reached out to our friends at Mudpuppy Games and Fat Dragon Games, and they agreed to design a 3D-printable version of our little buddy. The file to print your own will be available for free to all backers above the $1 pledge level. \nMudpuppy Games Telepathic Rats could be yours!\nWhy a Kickstarter?\nThis Kickstarter funds the limited-edition printing for the high-quality Riso print run, and reimburses the artists and design team who have helped bring this issue to life.\nWhere does the project come from?\nFor forty years we have been playing games, and building campaign worlds across all editions of D&D, as well as many other games. During that time, we have created a lot of content that our own players have loved. We have recently come into the DCC community, and the torrent of third-party products is truly amazing! It has inspired us to try our hand at putting together a fanzine of our own, and this is the second issue!\nWhat is the plan?\n1) The Kickstarter ends and we wait for transfer of funds! After that, we will post the pdf of issue 2 for backer review.\n2) We Stomp the Typos! We have supported hundreds of Kickstarters (literally!), and we notice that the very best ones allow for some crowdsourcing of stomping out typos. So, we will allow for two weeks to stomp out the typos! You can report typos on our own website, and we will work these into the editing process for fixing! In the end, we all get a better product.  After all, who wants a wonderful Riso printed limited edition book when it has typos in it?\n3) Final corrections!  We will update the PDF on DriveThruRPG.com, and prep the POD version, which will also need a test print ordered. This is the part where we get the file for the Riso print ready as well!\n4) Review the test prints!  Once we are happy with the physical and POD test prints, we will release them for printing! For some of you, this will be the fulfillment of the Kickstarter, but for many of you, there is one more step!\n5) SHIPPING! We will securely package issue 2\u2014along with any stretch goals\u2014and ship them out to all of you.\n6) Issue 3 is just around the corner! We are deep into writing the next four issues already, with lots of awesome content to drive some seriously crazy roleplaying sessions! For those who back at the \u201cThat third course looks great!\u201d level, as soon as the Kickstarter ends we will give you access to the behind the scenes facebook page where we are deep at work on articles and art for issue 3 and beyond. Come share in the crazy process, and let us hear your voice!\n What is Dungeon Crawl Classics? \nDungeon Crawl Classics is a tabletop role-playing game published by Goodman Games. DCC uses modern mechanics to allow players to experience adventures in line with the heroes described throughout the sword-and-sorcery genre that inspired Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson to create the first role-playing game. Find out more about Dungeon Crawl Classics at www.Goodman-Games.com.\n About the Wyrm's Creators \n Trevor Stamper\u2014Trevor has had aspirations of being a Not-Quite-As-Dark Master for numerous years, tormenting players in home campaigns on at least two continents. At the age of 10, Trevor was launched into an AD&D game with his friends on Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. But once he moved to England, he lost touch with the game and explored other classics\u2014Indiana Jones, Twilight 2000, Gangbusters, Traveller 2300\u2014 until Joel Phillips reintroduced him to D&D BECMI style when he was 15. From the start, tinkering with the rules was just common sense to him\u2014in fact, one of the items featured in Issue #1\u2014The Silver Ball\u2014originated in games from this time period run for a game at the infamous Golden Dragons Gaming Club on Woodbridge AFB, and has been stewing there for almost 30 years! From there it has been a life-long passion for gaming and creating things other players can enjoy. Trevor has published before in minor ways\u2014a few articles in the now defunct ENWorld Journal, and some really minor contributions when Kobold Press was doing Open Design. He has also extensively playtested material for almost thirty years\u2014starting with Werewolf first edition for White Wolf, to most recently a plethora of Fantasy Flight Games' offerings in the Warhammer 40K and Star Wars ranges. After 183 Kickstarters as a backer, this is his second one as a creator!\n John Olszewski\u2014John is a scientist, Marine, amateur woodworker, and of course, gamer. Born in a small town on the shores of Lake Erie in Western New York, he is also a lifelong Buffalo Bills and Sabres fan, traveled the world (four continents and counting) and played or ran games everywhere he\u2019s gone. Starting out in junior high school, back in the 1980s with 1st edition D&D, he has been playing ever since. Of the many systems, his favorites include D&D/Pathfinder, World of Darkness, Shadowrun, Warhammer 40K, and now DCC. John met Trevor back in 1997 in New Mexico when they were both in grad school and have been working together since then on world development and game rules for various campaigns, including Nearn\u2014a fantasy ringworld that the Wyrm will touch upon from time to time. In that time, he's playtested extensively for Fantasy Flight Games on their Warhammer 40K and Star Wars games, as well as Ulisses Spiele\u2019s 40K game, and products from Paradigm Concepts and Eden Studios, and been a member of the RPGA and the University of Buffalo\u2019s Strategists and Role Players Association (UB SARPA).\n Brian Gilkison\u2014Nowhere near as evil as Trevor or John (more of a clueless minion, really), Brian first came to gaming through the Holmes box set for D&D; in that same summer, Star Wars was released, and he first read The Hobbit\u2014so he feels like he comes by his geekdom honestly. He was an administrator, writer, and DM for the Ohio region of the RPGA\u2019s Living Greyhawk campaign, and a writer and DM for the followup 4th edition campaign, Living Forgotten Realms. Like Trevor and John, he was also a playtester on the 40K and Star Wars lines from Fantasy Flight Games. It is possible that he may secretly be in charge of his local chapter of the Esoteric Order of Dagon.\n Joel Phillips\u2014Just can\u2019t keep a dude down! Joel was introduced to the world of gaming in 1985 (5th grade) by playing the BECMI edition of D&D, and through the Endless Quest and Fighting Fantasy books. The Fighting Fantasy books inspired Joel to do art. His efforts redoubled when Joel moved to Woodbridge AFB in 1988 and he met Trevor\u2014and the two have been gaming together ever since! Joel went on to the Joe Kubert School for Cartoon Graphic Design to learn more about the trade, but had since fallen away from doing art until reinvigorated by Trevor and Brian's incessant pestering. A lover of all things Warhammer, Joel believes that the Games Workshop brand of games has consumed his life for almost 30 years. Beyond that, Joel has run very successful D&D, Warhammer Fantasy, and Dark Heresy games over the years. Producing the \"Onward Retainer\" comic for the Smoking Wyrm has been a fun revisit to the world of art\u2014and he is now hard at work drafting up the next few episodes. Joel is also an avid blogger, running the Neverness Hobby Chronicles, where he reviews gaming fiction, and paints lots of Orky goodness!\n Caitlin Stamper\u2014Caitlin grew up in a gaming household. Whether it was playing a precocious intelligent mouse at the age of 5 (squeak!), or a groovy witch at the age of 20, she has never known a life where there is something other than a bi-weekly game table (or better yet\u2014weekly\u2014those were the days!) to beckon you to adventure. A Purdue graduate in professional writing and graphic design, Caitlin has the built-in skill set to enable our ideas to bloom on the printed page! She is now seeking the adventure of adult life\u2014editing and designing things to make the world a better place. Caitlin has now gone on to her first professional job as a designer for a major book publisher--so the Smoking Wyrm is something she does out of love of the game.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks and challenges\n\nTales from the Smoking Wyrm issue 2 is completely written, with over 75% of the artwork finished already or in commission.
