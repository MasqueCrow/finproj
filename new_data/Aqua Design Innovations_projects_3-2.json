While this is our first Kickstarter campaign, we have an amazing team behind us to ensure the success of this campaign from conception to fulfillment. We are proud to have partnered with an industry leader, Aqua Design Innovations (ADI), who have launched over 8 successful Kickstarters! ADI shares our values of quality and innovation, and this collaboration has resulted in a promising campaign that seeks to bring joy and beauty to countless homes and offices. \nAs plant lovers, it wasn\u2019t long before we were running out of places to keep our plants. We wanted to find a way to bring more plants into our lives in a new and innovative way. There are an abundance of stunning species of plants, and countless ways to create arrangements. However, there are limited options for the housing of indoor plants. BloomingTables was born out of the idea that beautiful plants deserve beautiful homes. We have created a product that has brought character and joy into our home, and we want to share this experience with others. \nBloomingTables was not created overnight. We have gone through 3 rounds of prototyping, dozens of tweaks, and assured that we selected a trusted manufacturer that would bring the highest level of quality. We are excited to finally be able to bring this product to you. Thank you for your support in our mission to beautify homes and offices everywhere \u2013 one BloomingTable at a time. \nTimeline:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOnce our campaign is completed and funded, we are ready to go place our order with our manufacturer.

Invented by Ruth Grace Wong, the Leave Me Alone Sweater went viral, and now we need to put together an order of 300 sweaters to be able to have them manufactured.\nFeatures\nMade from 55% hemp and 45% recycled fiber fleece, each charcoal-colored, cowl-neck Leave Me Alone Sweater features cozy thumbholes, side seam pockets, and a high-quality, California-made zipper.\nWe've been working hard sourcing the perfect fabric, perfecting the pattern and fit, and visiting local factories. We came up with a fantastically comfy sweater made to last many years, and our entire supply chain is something we can be proud of.\nPlayful | Sustainable | Manufactured Locally | High Quality\nSizing Chart\nFollow us!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nUnderstanding manufacturing means being empowered to support jobs within my local community and to create something new and share it with the world. I hope to be able to use my success to do just that. This will be my first experience doing sourcing and working with factories, and I've been preparing by taking garment industry classes (http://garmentindustry411.com/) and attending a production sewing boot camp (http://abqfashionincubator.com/wp/).\n\nHere are what I think the biggest risks are, and how we are addressing them:\n\nRunning out of money\nWe've costed the fabric and the cutting and sewing for the sweater, and left in wiggle room for other expenses like shipping the fabric, care labels, packaging, and fulfillment. If everything goes perfectly we will be able to invest 40% of the money from Kickstarter into making extra sweaters, but if something goes wrong or costs more than expected, we will have money to fix the issue and maintain our high quality standards.\n\nNot being able to fulfill on time\nIf our fabric supplier does not have enough fabric in stock in their warehouse, the lead time to have fabric manufactured is 8 weeks. For cutting and sewing the sweaters, it takes about 6 weeks. Plus it will take extra time for shipping the parts to their destinations, and packaging and shipping the completed sweaters to backers. Based on these numbers we think we will be able to ship in October, but if we run into unexpected problems, we can be up to 2 months late and still ship by Christmas.\n\nPoor quality\nAs the amount of American garment manufacturing decreases, the availability of highly skilled workers also goes down. The sweater is designed with a simple construction so that it can be sewn consistently well by any factory. I have also taken steps to educate myself by taking courses and attending a production sewing bootcamp, with the intention of visiting the factory regularly during production to catch and remediate any manufacturing issues early on.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Ruth Grace Wong\nFirst created \u00b7 11 backed\nmanufacturing engineerSee more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Virtual High-Five!", "descp": "Thank you for supporting the project!

Not in The Good Life! This game is made for you!\nPlay as Naomi, a journalist from New York who moves to a backwoods British town called Rainy Woods in order to pay off her massive debt.\nThe only way for her to escape from debt hell is to take pictures of happenings in the town and report on them. Of course, 'the happiest town in the world' is not your average town...  \nThe inhabitants of the happiest town in the world are some of the most bizarre people you'll ever come across. You'll live alongside them as you solve mysteries and experience a hearty helping of craziness. We're sure that you'll eventually come to love all the mystery, horror, and good old charm that this town has to offer.\n\nDownload from the link below\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1wkbB1bNsht-EVkiyvfxdYumbZGIwmuTW/view?usp=sharing\n\nThe Good Life Prototype Demo, Available Now!\nRead Update 24 for all the instructions\nThe main character of this game is a female New Yorker named Naomi. In order to pay off her debt, she took a job from a newspaper company in NY and moved to the 'happiest town in the world.' This game chronicles all the bizarre things she experiences during her time in the town.\n A completely new 'daily life action-adventure game' with a slow life that isn't actually slow!\n In this game, the player has two main goals: \n1. Pay off your debt with money you earn from doing photography jobs in the town.\n\n2. Solve the mystery of the murder that took place in the 'happiest town in the world.'\nThe townspeople are also hiding a big secret...\n In the moonlight, all the townspeople suddenly transform... And suddenly, the town is filled with cats and dogs!\nOnce a month, everyone who lives there transforms into either a cat or a dog.\nNaturally, Naomi and the player will also turn into a cat or a dog.\nYou'll be able to select whether you want to transform into a cat or a dog at the very beginning. But if you get far enough in the story, you may reach a point where you can freely switch between them...?\nWhat happens in the town depends entirely on you!\nHow the townspeople behave, how their lives play out, and how the story ends... It'll all change based on your decisions.\n(How you interact with the townspeople and make friends with them will change how they think and behave.)\nThe townspeople's relationships will change based on how you play. In one town, you may see a surprising couple start dating... Or a normal character in your town may become the mayor of your friend's town...\nYou may even be able to influence how the story in your town plays out!\nThe story will eventually lead its main character (you) to a shocking truth...\nAs a journalist, your job is to take photographs as you live out your life in the town.\nYou can take photos of anyone, anywhere, then later post those photos on a photo app or sell them to a newspaper company for money.\nAll you need to do is frame your subjects! The abilities of your equipment will determine the overall quality.\nThis means that in order to take good pictures, you'll need to acquire a lot of different tools!\nBut first, you'll need to make a lot of money...  \nIn order to pay off your debt, in order to buy good equipment, in order to enjoy yourself, in order to quench your thirst for fashion...\nIn order to enjoy your life in Rainy Woods to the fullest, you'll need to take every chance you can to earn some extra cash!\nMake money with your photos!\n There are two ways for you to turn your photographs into money.\nThe first is to use the in-game SNS photo app \"Flamingo.\"\nUnlike Instagram, you can earn advertising profits for each \"Like\" your photos get.\nAll you need to do is upload them!\nChoose photos that best capture the seasons, add fun filters to your animal shots, or create a charming portrait.\nChoose photos that you think will get the most buzz on Flamingo and rack up the Likes!\nThe other way is to sell your photos to Morningvale, a newspaper company.\nPhotographs connected to the town's secrets will yield great rewards. What are the townspeople hiding...?\nSince Naomi's debt is connected to Morningvale, all the money you earn through them will only be used to pay it off.\nMake even more money with various part-time jobs!\n What do you think of when you hear the word 'countryside?' Gathering bugs and fruit? No, we're tired of all that! Shear sheep, deliver milk, make jam and hay, do some gardening, or work as a bartender, a casino dealer, a miner, or even mine for cryptocurrency if you want to! Enjoy some part-time jobs that are really 'out there' and give your country life a little mature flavor!\nBlow all the money you've earned on whatever you want!\n You can use the money you earn to pay off your debt and buy new camera equipment, but sometimes, it's good just to blow it on something fun!\nGo out for a drink, buy an expensive brand item, enjoy some afternoon tea, start an antique furniture collection...\nDon't forget to reward yourself for working hard!\nEnjoy the changes in time and season!\nThis is an open-world game centered around a rural English town. Naturally, the time and seasons will run on their own in-game clock. There will be special photos that you can only take in certain seasons which can be sold for lots of money, and we want traditional English events to appear in their proper seasons. Of course, classic events such as Halloween, Christmas, Valentine's Day, and Easter are also being considered! Aside from events, you can test your luck in other ways such as journeying into mines to discover valuable ore veins, fishing your heart out, or harvesting a field of crops.\nEnjoy fashion!\n You can use money to give Naomi some style! Try on different outfits and pick the look you like best. Some clothes might even boost Naomi's parameters...\nYou need to take good care of yourself!\nThis game contains various parameters. For example, life, stamina, hunger, sleepiness, inebriation, beauty care... And for Naomi, a native to one of the world's most cutting edge cities, beauty care is super important!\nMake sure you don't forget to give yourself some special care every morning and every evening. Otherwise, you'll lose your feminine charm and end up as a filthy flytrap!\nOnce per month, you can enjoy the limitless freedom that only cats and dogs get to experience.\nTurn into a cat and climb up to high places, scratch walls, and steal fish and chips from kitchens... Or turn into a dog and dig holes, follow scents, and swim in rivers and lakes... It only happens once a month, so make sure you enjoy it to your heart's content!\nCat/dog mystery solving image\nUse your telescope lens to snap shots of targets in areas you can reach as a cat, or get up close to them as a dog and try to acquire the perfect scoop for a scandal photograph. There are some mysteries that only animals can solve! When you turn into one, you'll be able to do new things and adventure into new places.\nFrom the very beginning, we have been very careful about focusing on the one goal that really matters, and that\u2019s getting the campaign funded.\nWe had made plans for Stretch Goals, though. We put together two plans, one in case the campaign was incredibly successful very fast, and another plan in case the campaign got funded a few weeks in. We also knew there was a chance the campaign would only get funded at the last minute, which ended up the case. We didn\u2019t talk about the other alternative, because we believe in the campaign.\nAnyhow, we want to address Stretch Goals in case we do get funded and you want to know what the extra funds will go towards.\nWe had a long meeting today about this, and we kept coming back to the one thing that we have been asked the most throughout the campaign: bringing The Good Life to the Nintendo Switch.\n\nEven though, as you know, our lead programmer has started to play with the console devkit, we know that this will be a costly endeavour and we don\u2019t want to mess up our budget.\n\nWe have set a unique Stretch Goal at JPY 88,000,000 - bringing The Good Life to the Nintendo Switch\n\nOf course, we know this is a very high Stretch Goal, and considering the way the campaign is going, it is very much possible we are not going to reach it, so let me explain our reasoning.\nWe could have set up more stretch goals, adding content to the game, and help them build up towards the Switch Stretch Goal. However, as each of this smaller goal comes with a cost, they would have set the Switch Stretch Goal even further, making it meaningless, and upsetting the numerous fans who have been asking for the Switch port.\nWe could have set up those smaller game content stretch goals, and not mention the Switch Stretch Goal, but as I mentioned, this is by far the number one request I have received during the campaign, and not addressing it seems bad.\n\nSo, we decided to aim high - go for one single ambitious stretch goal, the most requested addition to the campaign.\n\nBUT.\n\nIf we do get funded and we miss the Stretch Goal, we will use the extra funds towards additional content for the game and we will share what these are with you in a post campaign update. To give you an idea, we are considering things like adding more music tracks, adding more seasonal events to Rainy Woods, creating more part time jobs/revenue generating activities for Naomi to repay her crippling debt, more outfits for our intrepid photographer, and so on.\nThis way you know that whatever happens, you are building towards a better game.\n\nWhat happens to the Nintendo Switch version if we miss the Stretch Goal?\nWe really, really want to make a Switch version. Any game developer these days is excited about this console. I would love to see fans playing The Good Life on the go, on the train. However, I also want to make The Good Life, and for this, we need to be very careful with our budget, and have a clear focus.\nIf we miss the Stretch Goal, I will work very hard to find an alternative way to get the Nintendo Switch version to happen, but we are not making it a promise to you. And the moment we know we can make it, you will be the first to be informed.\n\nWhat about collecting funds after the campaign to go toward the Switch Stretch Goal?\n\nWe discussed this, and as you will see in the next part of the update, we are planning for a way to collect some extra funds after the campaign. However, I know other Kickstarter campaigns have run late backers campaigns in a way where they have set those extra funds to complete more Stretch Goals.\nI think this is admirable and brave, but for The Good Life, we want to be able to really focus on our initial game, and work really hard towards it as soon as possible. The idea of having Stretch Goals indefinitely opened after the end of the campaign is quite scary, it gives us a moving target, harder to hit.\nFor this reason, we are only looking at the funds gathered during the campaign for the Stretch Goals. I believe it will lead to a better focus on our part, and a better game in the end for you all, and I hope you can support that decision and that philosophy.\n \u201cDEADLY PREMONITION DEVELOPER ANNOUNCES NEW GAME, THE GOOD LIFE \u201d\n- IGN  \n \u201cDeadly Premonition creator\u2019s next game is a cat RPG\u201d\n- Polygon  \n \u201cDeadly Premonition director Swery announces RPG about people who turn into cats\u201d\n- Eurogamer\nShipping Information\nIn order to keep costs as fair as possible and to avoid those costs to count towards our goals, we are planning to use a pledge manager (like BackerKit) to handle the shipping costs. Shipping costs will reflect the actual cost to ship your pledge. They will be charged to you when the items are ready to be sent, after the game has launched.\nBackerKit confirmed for our pledge manager\nWe are very happy to be able to confirm that we will use BackerKit to manage the pledges after the campaign. If you are not familiar with BackerKit, they are a company specialised in supporting the logistical side of crowdfunding campaigns.\nIt will allow us to more efficiently manage the surveys, and make sure we collect the right amount for the shipping costs if you have a physical reward that needs to be sent to you.\nNow, BackerKit also allows us to do a few extra things that are interesting. We can run a late backers campaign with them - we are still figuring things out about this and we might do one. But more importantly, we do know that we will allow our Kickstarter backers to purchase additional items from the campaign. In order for you to be able to plan which tier is best to pledge for, we want to let you know now about items that we have confirmed will be accessible to our backers on BackerKit, and their prices.\nPlease note that the listed prices (just like the campaign rewards) do not include the shipping costs:\n\u30fbThe Good Life T-Shirt. $40\n\u30fbThe Good Life Hoodie. $95\n\u30fbThe Good Life Mug. $20\n\u30fbDigital Copy of the game on PC. $30\n\u30fbDigital Copy of the game on PS4. $40\nWe haven\u2019t confirmed the other items - especially the Collector\u2019s Edition box. The current CE box has an exclusive design for the Kickstarter campaign, but we know that there will be a Limited Run version available at some point as well, and it might mean we won\u2019t offer the Kickstarter exclusive box on BackerKit.\nIf you have already backed The Good Life and put money beyond the reward tier that you have selected, please note that you will be able to use those extra funds towards these extra items.\nAnd if you already know you want one those items, of course, you can increase your pledge accordingly, just make sure you stay at the reward tier that you want. For instance, if you want the Joyful Life Tier (about $50), but are interested in getting the T-Shirt, you can pledge $90, and keep your pledge at the Joyful Life Tier.\nThe Good Life - Physical Collector's Edition\nHere are the contents of the Physical Collector's Edition.\nIt's going to be filled with a lot of high quality items produced by Limited Run, a company known for its great work on countless physical editions so far! Here is a list of everything that will be a part of the set!\nThe Good Life Physical Collector's Edition Contents:\n- Kickstarter Exclusive Box (Embossed, with a completely unique design)\n- Physical Game Disc (your choice of a PS4 or a PC version; PC version comes with a Steam key)\n- Post Card (Scenery of Rainy Woods)\n- Post Card (Letter from Team With SWERY's & Mr. Futatsugi's Signatures)\n- Rainy Woods Tourist Guide Leaflet (A4 size, tri-fold)\n- Artbook (A bit smaller than A5)\n- Trading Cards (Characters / Dogs / Cats)\n- Soundtrack CD\n\nRewards description and USD prices\nBelow you can find a summary of all the rewards, along an estimate of their price in US Dollars. The campaign is in Japanese Yen, those prices below are purely a guideline for the price range. As currency exchange rates can vary, we recommend you check on a dedicated website to have an up-to-date price of the rewards.\n I'm SWERY, the director of The Good Life.\nThe Good Life is my \"dream game\". I've been thinking about it for a very long time, and was finally blessed with a chance to develop it thanks to my powerful partners - and you, of course. Please join in on our project and help us make my dream game into EVERYONE'S dream game! I Love You All!\n I'm Futatsugi, from G-rounding. A long time ago, I used to believe that games had magic in them. A new game always brought me a brand new experience, and excitement as to what would happen next. Crazy things would happen, and it felt really like I had fallen under some sort of spell. But lately, the risks involved in creating new games have gotten more and more extreme, and it's becoming harder and harder to make magic games. SWERY and I want to bring that magic back - but we need to borrow a little mana from you in order to summon it. We want to show the world a kind of magic it's never seen.\n I'm Hotta, the art director. When I first heard about The Good Life, I was deeply drawn in by atmosphere (a personal favorite style of mine) and the direction its art style was heading in. I'm so excited to start working on it. After working hard on the art direction, we've finally arrived at the style that I always hoped we would eventually reach! I'm going to put 120% of all I've got into this, while enjoying the chemical reactions that ensue between the art style, the atmosphere, and SWERY!\nI first met Swery in 2013, I think. We immediately hit it off, and always met up whenever I went to Japan and whenever he came to America. We quickly became good enough friends to have long, deep talks about the future together. When he released the amazing D4, we collaborated with him and performed the soundtrack live, but this time with The Good Life, we've received the chance to work with him on an even deeper level - actually creating the music itself. Orchestral music, band rock, and excellent singing are all important elements of the VGO, so we intend to supply you all with some Sweryism music that only we can create. We'll be posting some demos later, so please check them out!\nUnity\nWhite Owls has an idea for a fun game. G-rounding has the skill and the experience to create it. However, we don't possess the funds to push this project forward.\nSince 2010, the methods by which games are created have been changing rapidly. Through the proliferation of various game engines, virtually anyone can make their own game now as long as they set up the proper environment for it. Indie games have risen, multiple digital distribution platforms have become well-established, and new platforms such as VR have entered the fray. Due to these reasons and more, we game creators must adapt to many changes in order to survive. \nThis is especially true when it comes to gathering funds. The method to gather funds known as crowdfunding is now available to us. We no longer have to narrow in on our target and pitch an idea to a single investor in the hopes of possibly receiving a large amount of funds. Instead, it's becoming more and more common for game creators to pitch their ideas directly to their audience and gather funds that way.\nThe truth is that even in this day and age, most Japanese game creators still gather funds using the traditional method. But this method will never allow a creator to truly own their work and let it be their identity while also knowing that it will be able to support them their future -- two things that Western creators adopting newer methods have managed to achieve. In Japan, copyrights always belong to the investors, which includes not only the profits from those rights, but also the rights to create continuations using the same IPs.\nThat's why we want to take the awesome concept behind The Good Life and use our skill to build it on equal footing with our investors. After thinking long and hard about what our best course of action would be, we decided to adopt a hybrid model that allows us to push forth the project with both funds from partners and crowdfunding together.\nOur plan is to gather a portion of the necessary funds for our project from this campaign. Currently, we're already negotiating with several partners about this project, and we hope that successfully completing this campaign will bring The Good Life closer to perfection in the end.\nMany game creators narrow in on their target, alter their project scope and change their game ideas in order to gain a large amount of funds from a single investor. But what if all those game creators could take their awesome ideas as-is and simply propose them straight to their players?\nCrowdfunding makes this possible.We think The Good Life is an amazing idea, and will lead to a game that will be wholeheartedly accepted once it's completed. We want to prove this, with help from our supporters.\n*We created a pie chart that exhibits the funding ratio between crowdfunding and partners.\nUNTIES\n Limited Run\n Video Game Orchestra\nMEGA64 \nWe may add more allies in the future, so keep your eyes peeled in the updates!\nLast Autumn, we learned a lot thanks to our first campaign. We feel our biggest shortcoming was our inability to provide to our supporters a solid guarantee that we would complete the game no matter what.\nTherefore, we decided to reboot our project only after finding a powerful partner and getting proper guarantees in order to ensure that we would be able to deliver The Good Life to you all.\nBy teaming up with UNTIES, the new indie game label from Sony Music Entertainment, we will now be able to plan everything from the very beginning. The schedule up to the delivery of the product, localization, quality control, and making sure everyone around the world gets to join in.\nWe believe that this partnership guarantees that The Good Life project will reach completion.\nWhile The Good Life now has strong partners associated with it, the project still has a long way to go and has to prove itself in many ways.\nIn the same manner, White Owls is a young company, even though I, SWERY, have been making games for a while. The crowdfunding campaign is a good way for us to start relationships with our partners on a strong foot, where they feel confident that the game will be great, and my team and I have a strong understanding of what will make the game amazing for our fans.\nG-rounding has the history and more than enough power to develop the game, and partners have the marketing networks and the funds to release our game on a worldwide scale, but White Owls only has SWERY and the original idea for the project.\nThat's why I (SWERY) want to invite all our supporters to help us show the world the value of White Owls and The Good Life. If we can gather a part of the funds through crowdfunding and prove that White Owls and The Good Life has a strong appeal, we feel we will truly be able to push this project forward with far more power than we'd otherwise have on our own.\nIn other words, in order to create the best project centered around SWERY, we need much more than funds from a partner - we need to gather support (financial but also moral) through a crowdfunding campaign as well.\n\"But White Owls has SWERY. Isn't that enough?\" To all my fans and supporters out there who may be thinking something like this, I'm truly grateful. But the hard truth is that those feelings alone are not enough to create an entire game. We want to prove that White Owls is a development studio worth supporting, so please, lend us your help!\nWe want all our supporters to join this project from the very beginning so that everyone can carry an equal voice and equal responsibility. Let's work together to build The Good Life into the best game it can possibly be!!\nI Love You All!!  \nSWERY \n SWERY/WhiteOwls.inc                                     Twitter - Facebook - Instagrm - Webpage\nG-rounding.inc                                                                        Twitter - Facebook - Webpage\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 White Owls Inc. All rights reserved.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n\u25bcHigh volume\nSince this game is based around a rural town in England, we\u2019re going to need to make different environments and build events into them. With games like The Good Life, the fun factor is proportionate to the number of different events, so we need to try and put in as many events as we can and also create a variety of areas for them to happen in. This will cost us, and depending on how things go, we may not be able to include all the events we want to.\n\n[Solution]\nWe\u2019ve decided to create multiple plans for the game volume based on how much funding we end up getting. With the lowest volume plan, players will still be able to enjoy a mysterious story, take pictures and earn money, communicate with villagers, and enjoy life in a rural town. On top of that, we\u2019ll also create a schedule for building peripheral elements such as decorations so that the game development will never come to a standstill due to monetary problems. Our staff members have been in the game industry for over 20 years, so we know how to strictly control our schedules.\n\n\u25bcControlling a large number of characters is difficult\nIn this game, we\u2019ll turn characters\u2019 desires, habits, goals, preferences, and invitations to one another into parameters for an autonomous system that controls their actions within the game. This is the first time we\u2019ve tried something like this, but if we manage to complete it, we\u2019ll be able to freely add a ton of variety to the game. The risk is that we won\u2019t know whether or not we can really pull this off until we give it a try.\n\n[Solution]\nIn the end, if we can\u2019t figure out a way to pull it off, we\u2019ll control the NPCs using the same method we used in Deadly Premonition. We can create an enhanced version of that system, which has already been successful once, in order to greatly lower our risk of failure.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a5100 or more", "title": "Moral Support Tier", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nFollow THE GOOD LIFE campaign and receive updates!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}], "stat": ["388 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a51,500 or more", "title": "The Good Music Tier", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nFollow THE GOOD LIFE campaign and receive updates!\nDigital OST (lossless format)\n4 Digital Desktop Wallpapers of various resolutions", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}], "stat": ["167 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a53,000 or more", "title": "The Good Life on PC Tier", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nFollow THE GOOD LIFE campaign and receive updates!\nThe game on PC (digital version).\nNamed in the credits in the \u201cGood Person\u201d list.\n4 Digital Desktop Wallpapers of various resolutions\nNaomi alternative outfit (Good Life outfit)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}], "stat": ["4,157 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a53,500 or more", "title": "EARLY BIRD The Good Life on PS4 Tier", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nFollow THE GOOD LIFE campaign and receive updates!\nThe game on PS4 (digital version).\nNamed in the credits in the \u201cGood Person\u201d list.\n4 Digital Desktop Wallpapers of various resolutions\nNaomi alternative outfit (Good Life outfit)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}], "stat": ["799 backers", "Limited (1 left of 800)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a54,000 or more", "title": "The Good Life on PS4 Tier", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nFollow THE GOOD LIFE campaign and receive updates!\nThe game on PS4 (digital version).\nNamed in the credits in the \u201cGood Person\u201d list.\n4 Digital Desktop Wallpapers of various resolutions\nNaomi alternative outfit (Good Life outfit)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}], "stat": ["1,307 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a55,000 or more", "title": "The Joyful Life Tier", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nFollow THE GOOD LIFE campaign and receive updates!\nThe game on PC or PS4 (digital version)\nNamed in the credits in the \u201cJoyful Person\u201d list\nDigital OST (lossless format)\nDigital Storyline Overview (PDF)\nDigital concept art portfolio (PDF)\n4 Digital Desktop Wallpapers of various resolutions\nNaomi alternative outfit (Good Life outfit)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}], "stat": ["1,783 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a58,000 or more", "title": "The Double Life Tier", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nFollow THE GOOD LIFE campaign and receive updates!\nTwo copies of the game (PC or PS4; digital versions)\nNamed in the credits in the \u201cJoyful Person\u201d list\nDigital OST (lossless format)\nDigital Storyline Overview (PDF)\nDigital concept art portfolio (PDF)\n4 Digital Desktop Wallpapers of various resolutions\nNaomi alternative outfit (Good Life outfit)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}], "stat": ["240 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a513,000 or more", "title": "The Awesome Life Tier", "descp": "Shipping not included.

Wouldn\u00b4t it be cool to have a solid glass sphere with the structure of the Universe inside it? The success of our previous campaign \"The Universe in a Sphere\" showed us: Yes! But not only that, we got many requests if we continue making these spheres and if we plan to add more variants. We realized quite fast, that the Milky Way is a must have, especially if you already own the Universe in a Sphere. \nIn this sphere, every one of the 300,000 tiny dots represents an entire Galaxy. Due to the Milky Way being represented by only a single dot within the Universe Sphere, the vast amount of stars per Galaxy is hard to understand.\nNever mind, human can try do understand, so we decided to create a collection of Spheres. We want to go from huge to small, with the Universe in a Sphere as our our big bang, continuing with the Milky Way in a Sphere and only stop if you say: Please stop it, we don\u00b4t need more beautiful glass Spheres. \nHoping, that this will never happen, we already worked on many Ideas like The Sun in a Sphere, The Solar System in a Sphere, Elon Musk\u00b4s Tesla in a Sphere, The Earth in a Sphere, Bacteria/Virus/Molecules in a Sphere, DNA in a Sphere, Atom in a Sphere. So stay tuned and now:\nLet\u00b4s start with \"The Milky Way in a Sphere\"...\nHexgrid Base, LED Set, Round Base\nIf you google the Milky Way, you will find many beautiful pictures, fantastic animations and pretty decent maps. But after some research, you realize, a lot of it is artwork. \nTo make it short, it\u00b4s because a Galaxy is so stupendously huge, that it would take approximately 1,000 years with the speed of light, alone to reach a point from where you might see the other end of our Galaxy. If you stay inside it, you can\u00b4t see the forest for the trees. Especially the center is so crowded and bright, that you have no chance to see through...\nThis sun, our sun, seems to have around 200,000,000,000 brothers and sisters. Two hundred billion stars that rotate with a speed between 20 and 200 kilometers per second in the shape of a giant disk. There are 1 million times more stars in our Galaxy, than dots in one Milky Way Sphere.\nThe diameter of the disk is\n150,000 light years (1,400,000,000,000,000,000 km) and it is\n2,000 light years thin (190,000,000,000,000,000 km). Our closest neighbor is the star Proxima Centauri, which is apProximately 4 light years away (37,000,000,000,000 km). In these dimensions, movement is hard to notice and you can easily forget, that it\u00b4s only a matter of perspective and time .The sun circles the Milky Way every 220 mio years...\nPLAY\n\nVideo:(http://beltoforion.de/article.php?a=spiral_galaxy_renderer, music: Unicorn Heads)\nHow do we know, what our Galaxy looks like?\nWe will answer this question, right after the break, in which we show you, what you get if you support this campaign and why we need you.\nWhat do you get?\nIf you support this campaign, you can choose between \"The Milky Way in a Sphere\", \"The Universe in a Sphere\", different bundles, 3D printed bases and an LED Base plate. You can get the LED Base plate by simply adding 10 \u20ac to your pledge. It has different changeable color sets, but does not rotate the sphere. \"The Milky Way in a Sphere\" is still in progress, but the first prototypes and the previous Spheres are already convincingly beautiful. \nThe Milky Way in a Sphere V1, The Universe in a Sphere, Gift Box and Flyer.\nWe will offer the most favored bases of our previous campaign in order to prevent having 300 different variants to pack, like last campaign. If you want a special material or color we do not offer, you can visit our shop at\nhttps://www.shapeways.com/shops/cinks-labs  \nwhere you can order our bases (you will not be able, to buy the LED base plate there). Shapeways is a 3D printing company with its seat in Europe and the US.\nRound Base, Hex Grid Base, LED Base plate, LED Fitting Base + LED Base plate\nLED Base Plate + LED Fitting Base, The Universe Sphere on the LED Base Plate, different colors and materials of 3D printed bases.\nNow we want to lay the groundwork for future campaigns and designs, as well as we want to finish our second Sphere, \"The Milky Way in a Sphere\". We asked a friend, who leads a company for movie post-production, to help us and he has done some awesome work. Together, we designed the second prototype, which looked so impressive, that we are super hyped for the next projects. \nThe two prototype stages\nHow is the Milky Way measured and how much can we see?\nWe wanted to get the data for the Milky Way in a Sphere as detailed and true as possible, so we looked up, how the Galaxy was measured and who did it.\nWe found out, that the ESA (European Space Agency) sent the satellite Hipparcos into space, to map out the stars between 1989 and 1993.\nThat\u00b4s a while back, we thought, there must be more recent data...\nThe ESA sent another satellite in 2013, the Gaia mission, which revealed first data in 2016. We downloaded the data, opened it in excel and wondered, why there are no x-y-z coordinates? After some research, we noticed we have to transpose the data. Longitude (l), Latitude (b), Parallax, geometry, we had to remember the good old school days, learn something new and voil\u00e0, after several hours we were able to calculate our x,y,z.\n\nDistance = d=1/Parallax\nX = d*cos(b)*cos(l)\nY = d*cos(b)*sin(l)\nZ = d*sin(b)\nDoes not look like the Milky Way that much\nWhat do we see here? After some research and a phone call with a professor of the University of Astrophysics in Potsdam, our guess became true, it\u00b4s only a fraction of the whole. That fraction is pretty good measured, but again, the forest for the trees. With that knowledge, we found visualizations of the Gaia data and we became sure, we need more data to design the Milky Way.\nCredits: X. Luri & the DPAC-CU2. Simulations based on an adaptation for Gaia of the Besan\u00e7on galaxy model (A. Robin et al.) https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/iow_20110810\nSo we looked up more data. We found different infrared data, stellar density data, data catalogues like tgas and hyparcos, pictures, photos and we built the first prototype. It looked good, but not awesome. Every dot had the same size and the arms were hard to mention.\nWe hired Ronald and his company \u201cBASIS KG\u201d from Vienna, Austria and together we took our images, datasets and 3D models to create the second prototype. \n\"First, we concentrated on the stars in the arms and made them more visible and highlighted. After that, we selected the data from the bright star clusters and gave them more volume by adding stars. Next was to bring the stardust and all the asteroids into the Sphere and we decided to phase them out from the center to the edge\"\nAfter several hours of work we finally got the result and were so impressed, that we instantly ordered our prototypes...This is the first footage of our new Sphere, but we might improve it and its production  during the two month of our campaign.\nStretch goals\n100.000 \u20ac - The Milky Way in a pocket cube At 100.000 \u20ac we want to add the option for tiny glass cubes containing the Milky Way, that cost only 10\u20ac. \n200.000 \u20ac - The big sphere At 200.000 \u20ac we want to add the big 15 cm sphere, which still needs more development\n306.970 \u20ac - Designed product packing \nAt 306.970 \u20ac, the finish line of our previous campaign, we want to hire a company for professional packing, so the bases and spheres fit inside one designed box.\nThe prototype of the big sphere vs. the regular sphere. We will make another campaign for the big sphere, because it needs more development.\nHow is it made?\nTo show the laser etching process, we made a video of a cube, because it is better to see.\nThe Pocket Milky Way\n   The Pocket Milky Way 3x3x1 cm\nTestimonials", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLike in the past campaigns, it\u00b4s still necessary for us to produce a larger amount of spheres, to lower the production costs and make it affordable for many people. We have learned, that there will always be costs you can\u00b4t predict and we were really happy, that the initial campaign was such a huge success. \n\nWe also had some trouble with our shipping service provider, who messed up 3000 tracking codes, falsely rejected 200 packages because of the batteries. At the end, we delivered all these Spheres, but this cost us quite some time and nerves.

You should move fast to be one of the first to get their hands on CAMEO360, and join the community! \nOur team\u2019s effort on our development started in October 2015, we broke down our process to two stages to build both our app and our 360\u00b0 camera. First, our global collaboration with top engineers coming from top Fortune 500 companies such as Microsoft and Texas Instrument to develop a product that is durable, high-quality, energy efficient, and easy to use.\nMost small cameras in the market practically use the same type of schematics and offer limited capabilities. We created an active camera with 4K quality and dual lenses to give you more access to capture your moments in many different ways. \n Second, our team created the Flicksee App to be the perfect pair with the versatile CAMEO360 for you to easily access all the advance features to capture your moments. The Flicksee app gives you access to a new social media platform welcoming you to a new community, and allow you to easily share your moments with other popular social media channel. We streamlined the process of content creation to sharing so you can concentrate on what you do best and have fun. \n  Coming from California we believe design does matters. Our prototype offers a simple portable design, but our final production design will give the CAMEO360 a premium, sleek, and portable design you will be proud to carry and take out of your pocket anytime. \n      We teamed up with our manufacturing partner almost over a year ago. This is one of the two leading core manufacturers for action cameras in the market. Their vast experience in Original Design Manufacturing(ODM) gives our team an edge to be close to both design and manufacturing to have an advantage in both efficiency and cost effectiveness.\n                  We aligned ourselves with one of the top manufacturing of action cameras in the world, and we guarantee our product will be of top quality.

Making it possible for everyone to produce locally at home. The in-house developed LED technology and hydroponic system allow for optimal growth of your plants all year around. This way you can harvest up to 40% more.\nIndoor farming has never been that simple, clean and beautiful. Create your own living and colorful picture on any wall. It is completely leak proof. Choose between a beechwood or poplar finish. \n Featured in\nPresskit or news@ponix-systems.at\n Watch Co-Founder Alex Penzias TEDx Talk:\n  Herbert is a hydroponic vertical garden, which means that plants grow directly in water and no soil has to be used. This technology is also used by e.g. NASA for producing food crops on space exploration missions. This way planting needs less space, is clean and much more efficient. \nStep 1: Put a seed into one of our biodegradable sponges, which are also used by NASA, and place the sponge in a little pot.\nStep 2: Place the pot in Herbert, put one of our special seed caps on it until you can see a little seedling sprouting. Up to 15 plants can grow at the same time. \nStep 3: Add water and organic fertilizer.\nStep 4: Watch your delicious salads, herbs and fruits grow.\n     We've tested and analyzed various systems that are available on the market. There are many low cost countertop solutions but all of them lack the energy and size to be really productive.\nTherefore, we created a true vertical farm with a strong LED light to save you space and let you grow, even in the coldest of winters. You can easily set the time when the light should be switched on and off. \nOur specialized designers and prototype engineers put a lot of effort into designing a unique system, that saves you space while producing tasty and colorful vegetables, herbs, and fruits like strawberries faster compared to anything else available. \n40% faster compared to traditional farming methods. You can grow a fresh head of lettuce within 4-5 weeks compared to 2-3 months. Making it possible to harvest 80-90 lettuce heads each year \u2013 every 4 to 5 days one!\n  Growing at home gives you full transparency of your food. You know what is in it: no GMO, no pesticides, no herbicides, all fresh and organic. Harvest it when you need it. This way you can reduce your food waste too. \nThese are some examples of greens that we offer to grow in Herbert. Herbert comes with a starter kit which includes 30 sponges, seeds and fertilizer. More sponges and seeds can be easily delivered to your home. \n           Our free app for Android and iOS will guide you through the growing process and will allow you to adjust the light settings to suit your needs. \n                     Herbert: \nMaterials: Front: beechwood or poplar wood finish; Frame: white powder coated aluminium plate; Growing Modules: food safe Polypropylen (PP) \nSpace for up to 15 plants \nTotal weight (including light, water and plants): 12 kg/ 26,5 lbs \nMeasurement: 820 x 560 x 115 mm/ 32.3 x 22.0 x 4.5 inches \nPatent pending \nIncluded Power adapter: 110Volt/230Volt \nLED Light \n28 high quality LEDs \n60 Watt \nspecial developed light concepts enable best growth \nMeasurement: 200 x 300 x 500 mm/ 2.8 x 11.8 x 19.7 inches \nApp\nAvailable for iOS and Android for free\nLow energy Bluetooth connection \n             The Team\nSince 2014 Alexander Penzias and Alvaro Lobato-Jimenez are working on combining modern, smart technology with hydroponics to minimize the land, water and energy used in farming. Our ultimate goal is to make indoor farming simple, clean and enable everyone to do it at home. For three years we have been installing and optimizing hydroponic systems for restaurants and offices. Now we want to turn everyone\u2019s thumb green with Herbert!\nTestimonial\nIn 2016 we installed this 10m\u00b2 beautiful customized hydroponic system at top chef Leo Wrenkh's restaurant and cooking class studio. The Wrenkh family well known as vegetarian food pioneers, have their restaurant hearted in the city center of Vienna. \n     The Development\nWe have been working on Herbert for almost two years to make this product as easy to use and as clean and safe to work with, as possible. With our team of experts in their respective fields we have developed something new and beautiful, a product that will change your food consumption tremendously. \nWe have our suppliers and production partners ready to produce in the required quality and quantity. To guarantee quality and shorten communication channels we decided to fully rely on European partners, mainly in Austria and Hungary. After the last adjustments for mass production after the campaign has finished, we are looking forward to start production in July 2017. \nWe are here not just to pre-sell Herbert, but rather to expand our passionate community of urban farmers. We believe that you play an integral role in the development of Herbert. By supporting us you help to build the basis for the next generation of food production. Because we want to engrain food farming into our everyday lives. \nIf you are ready to join this exciting journey with us, please support our campaign and spread the word! A few clicks for you make a big difference for us.\n                                     Dein ganz pers\u00f6nlicher, vertikaler Garten f\u00fcr frisches, biologisches Essen. Chilis, Minze, Basilikum, Erdbeeren und vieles mehr. Du bestimmst was in Herbert w\u00e4chst.\nHerbert ver\u00e4ndert wie unsere Lebensmittel angebaut werden. Er macht es jedem m\u00f6glich, Zuhause an den eigenen vier W\u00e4nden Essen zu produzieren. Durch die eigens entwickelte LED Technologie und das hydroponische System, bei der die Pflanzenwurzeln direkt in Wasser, ganz ohne Erde, wachsen, k\u00f6nnen die Pflanzen unter optimalen Bedingungen gedeihen. Dies erm\u00f6glicht bis zu 40% mehr Ertrag im Vergleich zum traditionellen Anbau auf gleicher Fl\u00e4che.\nGem\u00fcseanbau war noch nie so einfach, sauber und sch\u00f6n, und dabei komplett auslaufsicher. Kreiere dein eigenes, lebendiges und farbenfrohes Bild. Die Frontplatte aus Holz ist wahlweise in Buche oder Pappel verf\u00fcgbar.\nGesehen in\n  Herbert ist ein hydroponischer vertikaler Garten, der mit LEDs beleuchtet wird. Die Pflanzen wurzeln direkt in Wasser, auf den Einsatz von Erde haben wir verzichtet. Auch die NASA vertraut auf dieses Prinzip, damit sie auf Raumfahrtmissionen Lebensmittel produzieren k\u00f6nnen. So braucht der Anbau deutlich weniger Platz, ist absolut sauber und viel effizienter.\nSchritt 1: Lege einen Samen in einen unserer biologisch abbaubaren Schw\u00e4mmen, welche auch von der NASA verwendet werden, und gib den Schwamm in den kleinen Netztopf.\nSchritt 2: Lege den Netztopf in eine der \u00d6ffnungen von Herbert ein und setzte eine unserer speziellen Anzuchtkapseln darauf, solange bis der Samen sprie\u00dft und du einen Keimling sehen kannst. So k\u00f6nnen bis zu 15 Pflanzen gleichzeitig angebaut werden.\nSchritt 3: F\u00fclle Wasser und den fl\u00fcssigen, bio mineralischen D\u00fcnger in den Tank.\nSchritt 4: Schau deinen k\u00f6stlichen Salaten, Kr\u00e4utern und Fr\u00fcchten beim Wachsen zu.\n     Wir haben zahlreiche, am Markt erh\u00e4ltliche Systeme getestet und analysiert. Es gibt einige g\u00fcnstigere L\u00f6sungen f\u00fcr die K\u00fcchenarbeitsplatte, aber allen fehlt die notwendige Energie und Gr\u00f6\u00dfe um wirklich produktiv bei gr\u00f6\u00dftm\u00f6glicher Platzersparnis zu sein.\nAus diesem Grund haben wir eine echte, vertikale Farm mit einer eigenen LED Beleuchtung entwickelt um dir Platz zu sparen und den Anbau auch im k\u00e4ltesten Winter zu erm\u00f6glichen. Stelle die Beleuchtungszeit und -intensit\u00e4t so ein, wie es dir und deinen Pflanzen am besten passt.\nUnsere Designer und Techniker haben hart daran gearbeitet, ein einzigartiges Design zu entwickeln, das gleichzeitig Platz spart und k\u00f6stliche frische Salate, Kr\u00e4uter und Fr\u00fcchte in einem f\u00fcr daheim noch nie da gewesenen Tempo heranwachsen l\u00e4sst.\n\nIm Vergleich zum traditionellen Anbau erm\u00f6glicht Herbert bis zu 40% mehr Ernte auf gleicher Fl\u00e4che. So ist ein Salatkopf bereits nach 4-5 Wochen, anstatt 2-3 Monaten, essreif. J\u00e4hrlich k\u00f6nnen so 80-90 Salatk\u00f6pfe geerntet werden: alle 4-5 Tage einer!\nDer eigene Anbau erm\u00f6glicht dir die volle Transparenz \u00fcber dein Essen. Du wei\u00dft was du isst: keine genmanipulierten Pflanzen, keine Pestizide, keine Herbizide, alles frisch und biologisch. Produziere und ernte nach deinem eigenen Bedarf und verringere so deine Lebensmittelabf\u00e4lle.\nHier ist eine Auflistung unseres Sortiments, das wir bereits mehrfach getestet haben. Zu deinem Herbert bekommst du ein Starter-Kit: dieses inkludiert 30 Schw\u00e4mme, Samen und Fl\u00fcssigd\u00fcnger. F\u00fcr einen gr\u00f6\u00dferen Komfort liefern wir dir weitere Schw\u00e4mme, Samen und D\u00fcnger direkt nach Hause.\n          Unsere gratis App f\u00fcr Android und iOS begleitet dich beim Anbauprozess und erlaubt dir die Lichteinstellungen so zu ver\u00e4ndern, dass sie dich und deine Pflanzen gl\u00fccklich macht.\n    Herbert:\nMaterialien: Frontplatte: Buchenholz und Pappelholz; Rahmen: pulverbeschichtete Aluminiumplatte; Anzuchtmodule: lebensmittelechtes Polypropylen (PP)\nPlatz f\u00fcr bis zu 15 Pflanzen\nGesamtgewicht (inkl.

Sie kombinieren die eigens entwickelte LED Technologie mit modernen hydroponischen Systemen, um so Land-, Wasser- und Energieverbrauch effizienter zu gestalten. Seit drei Jahren bauen und optimieren sie hydroponische Anlagen f\u00fcr Restaurants und B\u00fcros. Sie wollen indoor farming einfach, sauber und f\u00fcr jeden daheim zug\u00e4nglich machen. Mit Herbert kann jeder, auch ohne gr\u00fcnen Daumen, sein eigenes Gem\u00fcse z\u00fcchten.\n Testimonial\n2016 haben wir eine 10m\u00b2 gro\u00dfe, ma\u00dfgeschneiderte hydroponische Anlage im Szene Restaurant und Kochsalon Wrenkh installiert. Das Restaurant der Familie Wrenkh, bekannt als vegetarische Pioniere, hat ihr Lokal im Herzen Wiens.\n  \u00dcber die Entwicklung\nSeit  zwei Jahren arbeiten wir daran Herbert so einfach, sauber, bedienungsfreundlich und sicher zu machen, wie m\u00f6glich. Mit unserem Team von Experten aus unterschiedlichen Fachgebieten haben wir etwas neues und wundersch\u00f6nes entwickelt. Ein Produkt, dass den Zugang zu Lebensmitteln ver\u00e4ndert.\nUnsere Zulieferer und Fertigungspartner k\u00f6nnen in der von uns gew\u00fcnschten Qualit\u00e4t und Quantit\u00e4t liefern. Um diese Qualit\u00e4t garantieren zu k\u00f6nnen und um Kommunikationskan\u00e4le m\u00f6glichst kurz zu halten setzen wir auf europ\u00e4ische Partner, haupts\u00e4chlich aus \u00d6sterreich und Ungarn. Nach den letzten Optimierungen vor der Massenproduktion und nach Ende der Kampagne wird die Produktion im Juli 2017 starten.\n Wir sind hier um unsere leidenschaftliche indoor farming Gemeinschaft zu erweitern. Wir glauben daran, dass du einen wesentlichen Beitrag zur Entwicklung von Herbert liefern kannst. Mit deiner Unterst\u00fctzung legen wir gemeinsam den Grundstein f\u00fcr eine neue Art derNahversorgung.

There may be additional duties, fees or taxes raised by the authorities in your country. You may need to take care of them yourself when receiving the shipment.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis product is designed from the bottom up taking into account scalability in production quantities, simple manufacturing steps, aesthetics, as well as functionality while also producing as locally as we can. We have conducted various plant growing tests to optimize growing conditions in Herbert.\n\nUnforeseen events may occur and cannot always be completely mitigated. However, we are working together with a large network of experts, as well as other hardware startups who have launched successful campaigns in the past and who are happy to share their experiences with us. \n\nThe challenges that we face are:\n\nCertification Process\nHerbert will be sold in North America, Europe, and other selected countries. This means that Herbert has to adhere to, e.g., CE and UL certifications, among others. Out of its inherent complexity, the certification process can potentially require more time than expected.\n\nSoftware Development\nWe have developed an application that allows you to control the light settings of Herbert via your smartphone. However, developing software and testing can take time. Therefore, we are working together with experienced developers only.\n\nManufacturing and Supply Chain\nTo be able to produce Herbert in the highest possible quality whilst keeping scalability and affordability in mind, we require various production tools for injection molding, deep drawing, and extrusion processes. The level of complexity and interdependendcy of some parts may lead to unforeseen delays during supply chain and production optimization.\n\nPlant Harvest\nGrowing plants means you are dealing with living organisms that cannot be fully controlled.

Unfortunately, since Ponix did not offer blind covers for one or even two rows, this meant that not all holes could be covered. And even out of those that could be covered in a fashion that would guarantee that the holes would be covered and light kept out, are a brittle solution. These \"lids\" fall off at the slightest disturbance. Anyway, long story short: ALGAE are blossoming. I meant for other plants to grow ... and they do, but algae are also blossoming thanks to the inability to cover all unused holes and keep the light out. So apparently the whole Herbert will now have to undergo the maintenance cycle described in the manual. Personally I consider it kind of a negligence that the use case of using only one or two of the three rows is so badly supported, but there's nothing I can do other than attempting to find a 3D scanner and a 3D printer to create such a cover myself.

With healthy foods grown right on your windowsill, you can enjoy a higher quality of life 24/7.\nMost people don\u2019t have a backyard or the time to garden. But does this mean they should have to forgo quality for the spray-covered, \u201cfresh\u201d food supermarkets offer? We don't think so (and neither, we\u2019re betting, do you!) \nThe Smart Garden comes in three colours.\n    Our system is the easiest indoor gardening solution on the market, and it involves far less noise than the hydroponic systems. All you have to do is fill the water tank, plug the garden in and boom! - the Smart Garden 9 takes it from there.\nUsing the garden is as easy as 1-2-3\nWith more than 7 years of R&D under our belts, we've spent a long time developing the backbone of our gardens: The Smart Soil. This 100% safe, nanotech material supplies plant roots with the right amount of oxygen, water and nutrients at all times. It's no regular soil, but a material that breathes with the plant and evenly disperses air and water mixture based on the plant's needs.  Made of natural materials, the Smart Soil is biodegradable.\nThe Click & Grow Smart Soil\n  Our Smart Gardens are neither hydroponic nor aeroponic, but use a completely unique technology that grows food without using pesticides, herbicides or any other harmful substances.\nFaster growth without any harmful substances\n    \u201cThe single greatest lesson the garden teaches is that our relationship to the planet need not be zero-sum \u2026 [we can] provide for ourselves without diminishing the world.\u201d -Michael Pollan\nThis quote by the renowned journalist Michael Pollan hints at why so many things are wrong with today\u2019s food industry. Increasing urbanization has distanced us from nature and the knowledge of how to grow food sustainably. We at Click & Grow want to change this.\nPart of the Click & Grow team\nWith our Smart Gardens, you can easily get back to growing your own food and stop buying into the waste (of energy, resources, harvests, and more) that defines corporate farming.\n  The Smart Garden 9 is small enough to perfectly fit any apartment, yet big enough to transform the way you eat.\nGrow anything from tomatoes and parsley to trees and flowers with your Smart Garden 9. Mix and match the wide variety of plants we offer to find the combination that\u2019s right for you.\nJust a few of the available refills for the Smart Garden 9\n  Click & Grow is the only technology that reduces the moisture level in the root zone in a very controlled manner, and thereby uses water stress to increase bioactive compounds (antioxidants) in plants. By doing this, we've been able to raise the percentage of antioxidants in some of our plants by almost 600% that of store-bought alternatives. Keep in mind - this is done without using any chemicals or fertilisers! Our system is completely safe and clean.\nThe Smart Garden 9 in Grey\nThe antioxidants found in our plants, such as vitamin C, vitamin A and rosmarinic acid, are widely used in dietary supplements and have been shown to help prevent cancer, coronary heart disease, and even altitude sickness. Basically, the more antioxidants of different natural sources you consume, the better your health. \n      The Smart Garden 9 in Grey\nOur technology is not only more sustainable than the current food production practices, but it also grows plants faster and helps them attain superior antioxidant levels. Instead of using the messy pumps, mixers, filters, nutrient applicators, etc. of other indoor gardening systems, we use simple materials and nanotechnology to help you get better results effortlessly.  \n  Get better results sustainably\n    Drawing upon material and plant science, our technology optimizes plant's growth cycles by carefully monitoring the factors that affect their growth on a micro level. This means we can keep pH, aeration, moisture, and nutrition right where the plants need them to be without relying on the expensive mechanical control systems of hydroponics.\nTHE SOIL. We've worked long and hard to create our Smart Soil, and thanks to this unique, patented nanomaterial, our Smart Gardens don\u2019t need expensive sensors, pumps and filtering systems.\nThe Smart Soil\nTHE WATERING. Our advanced watering system uses safe sensors to continually distribute the perfect amount of water to each plant. This keeps your seedlings happy and healthy at all times. All you need to do is fill your Smart Garden\u2019s water tank once every two months.\nThe lamps offer perfect hues to support photosynthesis\n THE LIGHTING. The lights used in the Smart Garden 9 reduce light pollution through the use of highly transparent optics. The garden\u2019s lamp mimics nature\u2019s most efficient photosynthesis peaks and maintains a healthy and natural environment for the plants. Better yet, the Smart Garden 9 features new OSRAM LEDs that offer maximal efficiency and the perfect spectra for photosynthesis. This means faster growth, a bigger yield, and less waste.\nAre Smart Gardens connected to the internet or cloud?  \nThere's a specific reason we didn't make this a connected product. Do you really need a 500$ garden kit with an app that allows you to turn the lights on and off? We didn't think so. We don't want to offer you a fun gadget, but a garden that will grow you fresh food. And this is exactly what the Smart Garden 9 is. The lights will be on, plants watered and nutritious even when the AI's finally take over the internet.\nThe Smart Garden 9 in white\n                                      After successfully launching our second generation product on Kickstarter three years ago, we\u2019re thrilled to present this new creation to the community that first helped us take off. \nToday, more than 350 000 people have Click & Grow gardens, and in 2015 we asked these folks what they\u2019d like to see from us next. More than 80% of respondents said they wanted to be able to grow more food, and more than 60% said nine plants would be the ideal size. Since we had so much support and love from the Kickstarter community when launching our previous product - the Smart Herb Garden -, we wanted to give you the first opportunity to get the Smart Garden 9!\n        Measurements: 23in x 5.5in x 11in / 59cm x 14cm x 28cm\nWeight: 5,3 lb / 2,4kg\nGrowing capacities: 9 plants\nWarranty: 1 year\nAutomatic watering\nWatering tank: 1,45 gallons/ 5,5 liters\n10 LEDs; 10 000 lux\nOver 35 different pre-seeded plant capsules with fruits, herbs, salads and flowers + plant your own seeds in the experimental seedless capsules\nSubscriptions available (get up to 30% off retail price)\nFruits: Mini Tomato, Wild Strawberry, Chili Pepper, Sweet Paprika, Chillies, Physalis \nHerbs: Basil, Thai Basil, Red Basil, Dwarf Basil, Parsley, Peppermint, Lemon Balm, Stevia, Thyme, Chives, Oregano, Sage, Catnip, Hyssop, Dill, Garlic Chives, Coriander, Garden Cress\nSalad Greens: Leaf Mustard, Bloody Sorrel, Red Oak Leaf Lettuce, Green Lettuce, Frillice, Butterhead Salad, Bok Choy, Leaf-Beet, Kale, Komatsuna\nFlowers: Mimosa, Petunia, French Marigold, Moss Rose, Lavender, Sweet Alyssum, Busy Lizzie, Cockscomb, Painted Nettle \nGrow Anything refill: Seedless smart soil, grow any plant you want\nThe Smart Garden 9 is available for US and all EU countries, Canada, Iceland, Norway, Andorra, San Marino, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan and Macau. \nShipping is free for US, a shipping fee of 10 $ applies to Europe and Canada and 15$ for Hong Kong, Malaysia, Taiwan, Macau and Singapore.\nWe can't offer shipping to other regions due to strict seed and soil import laws many countries have, but we're definitely working our hardest towards making this product available for everyone. \n  Please find high-resolution images HERE.\nContact press@clickandgrow.com for additional information.\nThere's still a chance to get a good price!\n  Refer to a friend and get a discount!\n   ", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "WE'LL PLANT A TREE!", "descp": "We'll plant a SPRUCE pre-grown in the Smart Garden to help fight de-forestation.

It relieves energy blockages, eases muscle tension, and promotes blood circulation.\nThe energy flow in your body affects everything \u2014 how you feel, how you think, and how you breathe. Pressing into the healing points stimulate your body\u2019s innate way of healing itself and improves your overall health. \nUsing an acupressure mat is one of the most effective ways to relax, deal with muscle tension, and improve sleep. Instead of fingers, the mat uses pressure knobs to press the same healing points on your body.\n    Our acupressure points are firm enough to provide effective acupressure therapy, but soft enough for even your most complex flows.\nThe points also give extra grip surface, decreasing any chance of slipping during your practice.\nEnhance your performance, reduce slipping and injuries, and enjoy the health benefits of acupressure and reflexology.\n    Grippz Mats are closed-cell. The mats won\u2019t absorb water or sweat and won\u2019t develop odors over time.\n    Eco-friendly. Non-toxic. High durability results in fewer yoga mats in the landfill dumps, making Grippz Mats a safe choice for the environment overall. This is a yoga mat that will last you for years.\n        Grippz Mats was formed from a passion for eastern medicine and a desire to spread holistic healing to the world. Katrina, founder and CEO of Grippz Mats, is a trained acupuncturist and former yoga instructor.\nOne day, Katrina woke up with her face sagging and frozen in place. The doctors eventually diagnosed her with Lyme Disease and said half of her body would be paralyzed for the rest of her life. But she refused to give in. She used her training and knowledge to self-heal her body.\nThrough natural and holistic processes, Katrina was healed. It was then that she knew she had to spread the knowledge and capability of Eastern medicine to our western society. An idea came to her to combine her yoga practices with acupressure, and so Grippz Mats was born!\n    We've been working on Grippz Mats for the past year. It's been a long road and we\u2019re extremely excited to introduce this revolutionary acupressure yoga mat to the world.\nIn order to get the costs to a price we believe creates value for our customers, we need to have a large initial production run.

I think kickstarter makes it great for companies to get money, but it's got to be rife with unexpected snags, which leads to disgruntled backers, etc. Lots of people were upset having to pay extra shipping, but I just figured that was one of those unexpected things that happens when a new company is trying to meet the demands of an unprecedented number of backers/customers. Anyway, so I get it, and I believe I've been pretty patient. Anyway, this morning, I received the two mats that I ordered, but did not receive the travel bag. No worries. I'm sure the bag will come later. But I was very disappointed in the mats themselves. They look nothing like the ones in the video. The ones shown in the video looked to be nearly 1/2 an inch thick, with acupressure points that looked at least 1/4 inch in diameter at their bases. The mat on the video looked squishy and comfortable. This mat is a little more than 1/16 of in inch thick, and the acupressure points are 1/8 of an inch at their bases. The bottom surface of my mat has been on a just-vacuumed wool rug in my living room for about 5 minutes and has now picked up every fiber, random dog hair, lint, etc. A little gross, but maybe I just need to vacuum more. Though the pressure points are comfortable, the thickness of the mat was one of the reasons I ordered it, hoping it to be an improvement over my other yoga mats. I still feel the same strain on my hands as I do with other mats. Anyway, I don't know much about acupressure--I'm hoping the size of of the pressure points don't matter. And, I figure if I can put my mat on a really thick carpet, it will help.

It uses a new method of irrigation called aeroponics that waters your herbs through fertilizer-infused mist.\nAeroponics saves water and grows your plants much faster than conventional methods. It\u2019s the most sustainable and efficient way to grow herbs and plants in your home.\nNot all of us have the time, energy, or space to grow and maintain an in-soil garden, but with FogBox anyone can have an effortless and efficient aeroponic garden right in their homes.\nHow to get it\nBecome a backer of this project and pick a reward. You will essentially be pre-ordering a Fog Box. You'll get a special backer discount, and you'll receive your stuff before it is available in stores. Want to buy more than one? Check out All Rewards. Still confused? Check out How to Back this Project.\n            FogBox is easy to use, extremely affordable, and can sustain up to 5 herbs at once. Give your plants the moisture that they need without over-watering them.\nGrowing your own herbs can save you hundreds of dollars per year and growing them with aeroponics can help you save even more.\nNo matter the season, you can grow all your favorite plants indoors and add healthy air to your living space with the FogBox. This is the future of agriculture, home-grown foods, gardening, and much more.\n    FogBox uses only 12 watts of energy - about the same as a small lightbulb. The nutrients dissolve in the water, the water turns to mist in the fogger, then the roots can immediately absorb the nutrients right out of the air. This helps your plants grow twice as fast!\nThe roots hang in the air, so they can breathe as much carbon dioxide and oxygen as needed. This reduces mold and fungus and prevents \u201croot-rot,\u201d a common problem that happens when the roots can\u2019t breathe.\nLess Water Used and Wasted\nEnergy Efficient\nReduces Molds/Fungus\nAccelerated Growth\nPrevents Root-Rot\nSoilless System\nGrow Your Plants Anywhere\nWe designed a hand made, flame-polished acrylic LED light so you can grow your garden in your bedroom, office, bathroom, or sex dungeon.\n  FogBox is the FIRST aeroponics system specifically created for the beginner gardener. It's simple to set-up and use, at an affordable price.\nTake the first step towards leading a greener, more sustainable lifestyle and switch to organic foods without hurting your wallet. Have fun gardening with your kids while educating them on sustainable practices. Have access to super fresh herbs just an arm\u2019s reach away and know exactly where your food comes from.\n       1. Light : Turn On / Turn Off                                       \n2. Water Capacity: 1 Liter\nWattage: 12 watts max\nAC Adapter: Output - 24 volts ; Input - 120 to 240 volts (Wide range intl. voltage)\nThe FogBox has two functional settings: half power and full power. While on full power, the FogBox will need to be filled approximately 2-3 times a week while half power runs around 1-2. However, you should check on your FogBox daily to be safe.\n        Our mission is to empower people to make the first step towards making healthier food choices and leading a sustainable and healthy lifestyle. FogBox makes it easier for people to grow their own food, even if they don\u2019t have the time and energy to invest in a garden, even during winter time, and even in small apartments.\nIn recent years, we\u2019ve seen amazing new products bring aquaponics and hydroponics to the forefront. These advancements in gardening and living decor have shaped the way we grow our plants, made our living spaces healthier, and are the first steps in creating a more livable, sustainable world. Now, we\u2019re taking it to the next level with aeroponics.\nThe FogBox is complete. We\u2019ve partnered with an experienced manufacturer. We need your help to bring this into every home and make this dream a reality.\nJoin us and bring awareness to aeroponics, The future of agriculture isn\u2019t in the ground. It\u2019s in the air.\n     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've spent most of the last 2 years working with our partners to mitigate as many risks as possible, yet we know there will still be hurdles along the way.

Chef Torsten has also been involved in commercial horticulture since 2002 and has gained extensive knowledge on using, growing, and distributing.

As a result, he developed Grow.Bar for everyone interested in eating a healthy balanced diet.\nChef Torsten Schulz\nChef Adam Kenworthy is a Chef, culinary consultant and health coach based in New York City. Chef Adam emphasizes nutritious foods, light cooking and a healthy lifestyle. He works with clients to understand their nutritional needs and creates custom menus with organically grown foods and the freshest local market ingredients.

To carry out the project, Flo undertook a Master in Entrepreneurship.\nSo it is with our technical and business skills, combined with our love of good food that we decided to embark on the adventure and to develop our first product Calla. For the good development of the project, we also work in parallel with various key partners. Thank you to them for their support.\n  With a growing population and decreasing arable land area, we aim to provide creative and sustainable solutions to install green, sustainable and cultivable spaces in our cities. Our global vision is about world of food and especially the urban agriculture.\n    Dimensions: 13\u201d x 13\u201d x 16.5\u201d for a complete Calla\nWeight: 5.5 lbs\nPower: 12 W for the LED Light and 3 W for the pump\nFinish: PS plastic with UV protection and soft touch\nIn the box:\n(1) Central structure composed of\n- Controlled LED light\n- Self-watering system (pump included)\n- Water supplier\n- LED light cover\n(2) From 2 up to 6 lower pots according to your order\n(3) From 2 up to 6 upper pots according to your order\n(4) Nutrients pack\n(5) Filters pack\n(6) Power supply\n(7) User Manual\nTimeline\nHere follows the timeline of our project. This timeline is of course theoretical but, based on competent advice and background knowledge, we aim to deliver you Calla in February 2017, right in time to prepare for spring !\nIn order to give you the perfect product, we need to invest in special molds allowing us to replicate plastic pieces at a high rate. So before to manufacture, we have to invest. Funds from this crowdfunding campaign will be mainly used to finance a first stock and the resulting profit will be allocated to the molds financing. To pay them, other funding parts are necessary and the success of this crowdfunding campaign is of high importance as it will enhance the funding leverage effect among investors. Funds from the campaign will be allocated as shown on the graph below. \nThe other funding part will come from private and public investors. It may reassure you to know that if we fail to finance the molds, you will get your money back.\nHelp us to reach 75.000\u20ac and to offer a free one-year of nutrient sticks for all of our backers!\n   You want to keep informed or simply discover Calla on the social networks?

A gauche, c\u2019est Flo, le gourmand qui a toujours r\u00eav\u00e9 d\u2019entreprendre. A droite, c\u2019est Rom, le passionn\u00e9 de cuisine \u00e0 la recherche des meilleures saveurs qui a toujours eu pour ambition de cr\u00e9er un projet autour de l\u2019univers culinaire. Nous nous sommes rencontr\u00e9s sur les bancs d\u2019une \u00e9cole d\u2019ing\u00e9nieurs et c\u2019est l\u00e0 que nous avons d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de nous attaquer ensemble \u00e0 la probl\u00e9matique de l\u2019entretien des herbes aromatiques. Afin de mener le projet \u00e0 bien, Flo entreprend ensuite un master en entrepreneuriat.\nC\u2019est donc avec nos comp\u00e9tences techniques et entrepreneuriales, combin\u00e9es \u00e0 notre amour pour la bonne cuisine, que nous avons d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de nous lancer dans l\u2019aventure 4Senses et son premier produit Calla. Pour le bon d\u00e9veloppement du projet, nous travaillons \u00e9galement en parall\u00e8le avec diff\u00e9rents partenaires cl\u00e9s. Merci \u00e0 eux pour leur soutien.\n  Notre vision globale tourne autour du monde de la nourriture, et plus sp\u00e9cialement de l\u2019agriculture urbaine. Avec une population grandissante et des terres cultivables qui diminuent, nous avons pour ambition de proposer des solutions cr\u00e9atives et durables pour installer petit \u00e0 petit des espaces verts et cultivables dans nos villes.\n    Dimensions: 33 cm x 33 cm x 42 cm pour un Calla complet\nPoids: 2.5 kg\nPuissance: 12 W pour la lampe LED et 3 W pour la pompe\nMati\u00e8re: Plastique PS haute qualit\u00e9 avec protection UV et \"soft touch\"\nDans la bo\u00eete:\n(1) Structure centrale compos\u00e9e de :\n- Lampe LED contr\u00f4l\u00e9e\n- Syst\u00e8me d'arrosage automatique (pompe inclue)\n- Pi\u00e8ce de distribution d'eau\n- Cache-LED\n(2) De 2 \u00e0 6 pots inf\u00e9rieurs selon votre commande\n(3) De 2 \u00e0 6 pots sup\u00e9rieurs selon votre commande\n(4) Pack de nutriments \n(5) Filtres\n(6) Alimentation \u00e9lectrique\n(7) Mode d'emploi et informations\nCalendrier des \u00e9tapes\nVoici le calendrier de notre projet Calla. Ce dernier est bien s\u00fbr th\u00e9orique mais, sur base de notre exp\u00e9rience ainsi que des devis et des conseils comp\u00e9tents re\u00e7us, nous esp\u00e9rons livrer Calla chez vous en f\u00e9vrier 2017, juste \u00e0 temps pour se pr\u00e9parer pour le printemps!\nLa production n\u00e9cessite un investissement cons\u00e9quent dans des moules permettant de r\u00e9pliquer les pi\u00e8ces plastiques servant \u00e0 assembler le produit final. Avant de pouvoir produire, nous devons donc investir. Les fonds obtenus gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 cette campagne serviront essentiellement \u00e0 financer du stock et la marge d\u00e9gag\u00e9e sera allou\u00e9e au financement des moules. Afin de pouvoir acqu\u00e9rir ceux-ci, d\u2019autres sources de financement sont n\u00e9cessaires et la r\u00e9ussite de cette campagne de pr\u00e9-commandes est d\u2019une grande importance car elle permettra d\u2019am\u00e9liorer l\u2019effet de levier chez nos investisseurs. Les fonds r\u00e9colt\u00e9s gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la campagne seront donc distribu\u00e9s comme le montre le graphique suivant. \nL'autre partie du financement proviendra principalement d\u2019investisseurs priv\u00e9s et publics mais rassurez-vous, si nous ne parvenons pas \u00e0 financer les moules, votre argent vous sera restitu\u00e9.\nMerci beaucoup! Nous avons atteint la barre des 50.000\u20ac mais ne nous arr\u00eatons pas l\u00e0. Aidez-nous \u00e0 atteindre 75.000\u20ac et d\u00e9bloquons ensemble un an de nutriments gratuits pour tous nos contributeurs!\n  Vous souhaitez rester inform\u00e9 ou bien simplement d\u00e9couvrir Calla sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux?

See how simpli press is French press without the mess!\n  For an extra clean brew, just add a paper filter.\n    All the grounds lift up in the grounds container, along with the filter! You can then just take the grounds container to your compost bin, your plants, or your trash and easily chuck out the grounds! (Note: Disposing all the coffee grounds in the sink is a plumbing no-no so don\u2019t do it!)\nBy not having to scrape and tamp out your glass carafe to get the grounds out, save not only time but hopefully money by less chances of breaking your carafe!\nWoah, show me that cleanup again!\n    Get more out of your coffee by being able to use fine to medium grounds. With our special filter, you get a richer, smoother taste!\n      So what does choosing your grind size and an optional paper filter mean to you?\nYou can tailor your brew to fit your roast and preference *or* just keep it simple by using any available grounds that you have! \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af  \n  When using fine-medium grinds, you not only get more LOVE and FLAVOR from your coffee but you also get a FASTER BREWING TIME because of the higher extraction rate! \n    We\u2019ve brewed thousands of cups for coffee lovers, roasters, baristas, and coffee events across the country (NY Coffee Festival, Portland Coffee Fest, Coffee Con LA, SCAA Atlanta, etc), and here\u2019s what they had to say about simpli press:\nPLAY\n\nWe even won a New Product Award at Portland, coffee capital in America and judged by top coffee industry experts (note: Seattle was full in attendance at this event too)!\n    Finally, a coffee press that consumers and coffee professionals both love and can use easily!\n         simpli press is perfect for sharing or just have it all to yourself - you deserve it!\n    simpli press is eco-friendly, leaving only compostable grinds after your morning brew.\n  We\u2019re redefining the way people press coffee. We\u2019ve come this far with an incredibly small team and a boot-strapped budget, and we are committed to making simpli press a success. We talked to various manufacturers and created our first prototype in February 2015. We got the second prototype September 2015, where we put it through arduous testing brewing thousands of cups at coffee events, asked other coffee lovers for feedback, and further improved the design. Then in March this year, we ordered our third simpli press prototype from our manufacturing partner and are almost ready for production.\nManufacturing Costs\nThis is the most capital intensive part of our next phase. We have finalized our design, chosen our manufacturer and created a budget breaking down the costs for producing the initial molds, purchasing supplies, meeting the minimum quantity order, and shipping to consumers. We need your support to get simpli press to the next step.\nCreating the 21st Century, Third Wave French press\nOur goal is to not only develop a product, but to make great coffee accessible to all in today\u2019s time. To do this, we need your support from this initial campaign to not only fund our production, but also get the word out about what we\u2019re developing around the world.\n        Simpli Press Mission\nTo make your coffee ritual more beautiful and easy in every way possible.\nWe want to make your coffee ritual easy from brewing to cleanup, while giving you the most delicious coffee.\nWe also want to make it easy and fun for you to try out different ways to make your brew to bring out the best in the roasts and according to your taste. We, as a company, will also incorporate giving back to education and coffee farming communities into our long-term plans.\nThe Team\nJenni Morse & Scott Morse (Co-Founders)\n\u201cThis journey started over two years ago as a literal dream January 2014. I woke up and started sketching simpli press. With my dad being an inventor, it's just in my genes. The passion project became an obsession. By May 2015, I quit my job as an Executive Recruiter (Manufacturing & Engineering specialties) to focus on developing simpli press full-time. In the last year, Scott and I have been traveling the country showcasing the simpli press at coffee trade shows in New York, Portland, Los Angeles, and Atlanta. So far, the response has been more than encouraging to keep pursuing this crazy dream, this calling.\u201d Jenni Morse\nIt all started with wanting to drink French press every morning, but between brewing and cleanup time, it just wasn't possible.\nWe also thought \"There has to be a way to get all of those great coffee characteristics: the richness of an espresso, the flavor clarity and smoothness of a pour-over, and the body of a French press from one device and without a messy cleanup.\" With simpli press, one can develop an optimized brew in 2-3 minutes (by being able to use fine to medium grinds) plus an easier cleanup makes a difference in our hurried lives.\nThen the taste factor came shortly after as our new favorite by being able to get more flavor out of the coffee beans with the fine to medium grinds (40% more according to the coffee scientist) and brew different roasts (light and medium). The smoothness of the brew is one that everyone always first notice.\nWe loved brewing at the live coffee events all over the country (see our Kickstarter video and more below) to just see people's reactions and feedback on the difference! We even won a New Product Award (3rd Place) at Portland amongst the established brands and judged by the industry experts (not to mention ultimate coffee snobs)! :)\nMore than two years, countless hours, personal sacrifice, and three prototypes later, we are introducing the simpli press: a coffee brewer that does just that!\nManufacturing Team\nAfter six months of research and multiple referrals, we found the perfect manufacturer. Platform 88 has not only worked with major coffee/kitchenware brands, but has also worked with several successful Kickstarter campaigns in the coffee and beverage industry (which have delivered to backers and are a few are now for sale in retail stores).\nWe have met the owner in person and are in constant communication with the team. We plan to visit the factory and team in person, once the Kickstarter campaign commences.\nBehind Our Team\n  Special Thanks To\nThank you so much for checking out simpli press, French press without the mess and oh so much more. We can\u2019t wait for you to make your coffee ritual more beautiful, in every way possible.\n     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAfter two years of developing and testing the simpli press prototype we are confident that we have the best design possible made with the best materials.

Give\u2019r provides a tangible reminder to ourselves and those around us to seize opportunities in the everyday and to give life our all. Give'r promotes a lifestyle fueled by passion, purpose, challenge and adventure.\nWe aim to inspire the unrelenting pursuit of dreams, the confidence to take the road less traveled, and the desire to share the wonders of life with others.\nWe promote these beliefs by designing and creating straightforward, fun, comfortable apparel and accessories, made for the Give\u2019r that lives within us all.\n Choosing to Give\u2019r doesn\u2019t solely pertain to outdoor adventures, it\u2019s about giving it your all in everything you do. If you\u2019re trying a completely new hobby, starting a company, or even moving halfway across the world to discover new experiences, the 4-Season Gloves are here to put adventure back in your hands.\nThese gloves are designed and built to get the job done so you can Give\u2019r however you choose! Whether you\u2019re a man or woman, parent or child, student or teacher, professional or amateur, these gloves were designed for YOU!  Get out there and live it up!\nDesigned for your day-to-day adventures, the 4-Season Gloves are perfect for travelers, adventurers, athletes, and everyone in-between. They\u2019re more than just great-looking comfortable gloves, they\u2019re a daily reminder to seize opportunities in the everyday and live your life to the fullest.\nThe new 4-Season Gloves\u2019 leather exterior provides superior dexterity, durability, and insulation for your hands. The gloves are waterproof and designed to handle colder temperatures and intense winter weather, while at the same time tough enough to literally hold a burning log. \nThe 4-Season Gloves keep you warm and comfortable whether you\u2019re gardening, skiing, chopping wood, climbing a mountain, or even dog-sledding. They make the cut for essential everyday gear that looks good, feels good and gets the job done.\nUse the 4-Season Gloves for any cold-weather sport, work, or recreational activities. These gloves are as multifunctional as you are.\n                                                                           Sizing (you will choose once the campaign is over):\nIf you have longer fingers and are on the line between sizes then go with the larger size of the two. If you are in between sizes on the chart, and like a tighter fit, then go with the smaller size; if you like a roomier relaxed fit, then go with the larger size.\nComparison to sizing on Classic Give\u2019r Gloves: The 4-Season Gloves are designed to be more form fitting when compared to the Classic Give\u2019r Gloves. While most customers wear the same size in both styles, if you are between sizes, or find your Classic Gloves to fit snugly, we recommend you select the larger size of options.\nInitial Branding: \n  Each glove is as unique as their owner, and we take great pride in the workmanship and attention to detail needed to make a pair of glove truly YOURS. Limit of three letters if you choose to have your gloves branded, branded on both the left and right hand.\nWax \u201cBomb-Proof\u201d Coating:\nWe will hand-treat and bake your gloves with bee\u2019s wax, saturating the all-leather shell, resulting in a look that is as tough as the gloves themselves.\nWe set out to design a timeless and stylish pair of gloves that is utilitarian through and through. Any day, any situation...this one glove does it all.\n  Durable Shell\nThe outermost layer features top grade cow leather that is tanned and treated to be waterproof. While cheaper alternatives exist, this leather was selected because it is the toughest available/on the market, yet soft and quick to break in. Leather shell has been reinforced for wear and tear on palms and fingertips.\n Hipora Membrane\nThe second layer of the 4-Season Glove features a membrane that is wind-proof and waterproof, protecting your hands and keeping them warm and dry. This membrane features tiny microscopic perforations that enables water vapor to escape, keeping your hands ready for action.\nThinsulate Insulation\nThe third and innermost layer utilizes material that is breathable and moisture-resistant to keep you warm and comfortable. Thinsulate insulation works by trapping heated air molecules between you and the outside thereby keeping your hands warm and isolated from the cold.\nLeather Skirt\nLeather skirt keeps snow, moisture and other material out of the gloves when putting them on and while wearing them. The inner cuff of skirt provides the perfect canvas for the Give\u2019r Crew to hand brand your initials.\nLeather Strap On Cuff\nPull straps make it easy and non-damaging to put on or remove your gloves as quickly as as you like.\nElastic Cuff\nThe compact design of the elastic cuff provides a snug fit, yet flexible fit around your wrist. Keeps heat in and and everything else out while remaining comfortable enough to wear all day.\nEvolved from our best selling Classic Give\u2019r Glove, coined \u201cThe Glove of 100 Uses\u201d. The demanding terrain and temperature extremes encountered by the Give\u2019r community resulted in countless requests for a glove that retained the core of the Classic, but incorporated additional features and enhanced performance.\nOver the past year and a half, we have designed and tested more than two dozen glove prototypes in our pursuit of this glove.\nGive\u2019r was founded in March 2012 in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Our product line began with two t-shirts, two hats and a commitment to our customers that we\u2019d stop at nothing to ensure they were happy with their Give\u2019r Gear. Our dream has come to life through 4 years of working multiple jobs, taking challenges head-on, continuously learning, receiving a tremendous amount of help, and our belief that the world is a better place with Give\u2019r in it.\n The road for a lifestyle apparel start-up company in Wyoming is not paved or easy-going, but we have been living by our motto, and have given our all to shape this vision into reality. We are beyond psyched with this opportunity made possible by Kickstarter and you, our backers, to write the next chapter of the Give\u2019r story. Without your help, we wouldn\u2019t exist. We are eager to set our roots and charge forward as a company that exemplifies what can be possible when you follow your heart. We take this step with confidence in our products and wholehearted gratitude for all those in our corner, cheering us on. \n We strongly believe in giving back through service and financial support, and have worked with dozens of local, regional, national and international non-profits since our inception. We believe in forming community by working with local businesses and connecting our customers from across the globe. We are proud members of 1% for the Planet and 1% for the Tetons, and are committed to playing an active role in making the world a better place for generations to come.\nOur goal is to bring to life the Give\u2019r that lives within us all. Straightforward, fun, comfortable apparel and accessories were at our core on day one, and we have built upon this foundation over the last 4 years. Your support enables our team to be fully dedicated to Give\u2019r while maintaining control of our mission and the ability to take risks that may not be possible through traditional fundraising means. \n While the 4-Season Gloves were merely an idea 2 years ago, the opportunity to share a final product in the flesh is something we are extremely proud of. We have completed the initial short-run of production and are as psyched as our videos and pictures show. They are freakin\u2019 awesome. We are a young company, and putting the 4-Season Gloves into full production takes a lot of work and capital. We are 110% committed to the work in front of us, but need your help in bringing the 4-Season Gloves to life at large-scale production. Take advantage of the big time discounts from retail pricing and join in the effort to support a company who is giving it their all to bring you the best damn gloves ever.\nIt all began in 2011 with the design and creation of custom hats commemorating an epic annual kayaking expedition in Ontario, Canada. These hats, featuring the skyline of the Tetons and the colloquial phrase \u201cgive\u2019r\u201d, were the seed from which Give\u2019r was born. This team, with help from an awesome and ever-growing community, gave life to a philosophy and lifestyle that is perfectly embodied by these 4-Season Gloves...our greatest creation to date!\nPLAY\n\n                                        ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe know there can always be curve balls along the way during production. Our initial short-run production and experience in manufacturing and eCommerce over the last 4 years has allowed us to mitigate much of the risk, but it still exists. We will always be honest and communicative with our community about challenges, including these:\n\nShip Date: We are confident we will ship by the projected dates, as we have manufacturers standing by for final order quantities. While there is always a chance things will take longer than planned, we feel strongly that our experience will mitigate this, and that all pieces are in place to Give'r.\n\nProduct Changes: As we receive community feedback and continue our product testing, slight changes may be made. Rest assured, we'll only make changes that enhance the product experience.\n\nJust as we felt 4 years ago when Give'r was formed, we commit to you that we\u2019ll do everything possible to ensure you\u2019re happy with your gloves.

Magpul makes an enhanced trigger guard if you have an AR-15; cheap fix. If you have a lever action there are large loops for lever actions; a bit pricey but doable. You might be able to find a winter trigger like they made for the M14/M1a; cheap fix. It just depends on the rifle platform. As for pistols...I have no clue. I suppose the glove would work best with a single action revolver or a double action revolver with the hammer cocked. I have never liked using a glove, let alone a heavy glove on my shooting hand. I cannot feel the trigger and the small space in the trigger is not ideal for a glove (just personal preference).

Conventional resources are limited and the grid is overburdened and unreliable. Renewable energy sources like wind and solar are a critical part of the solution, but they\u2019re also intermittent: limited to times when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing. And large amounts of intermittent energy simply can\u2019t be accommodated our current energy grid.\nFortunately, there\u2019s a fix. One that reduces your energy costs and contributes to a self-healing, ultra-efficient energy grid. This single, elegant solution is Orison.\nOrison gives you power over energy like never before. Whether you get your energy from the grid, a solar array, or some other source, you can now control when to store it and when to use it. Orison will automatically store energy when utility rates are low, and then use that energy to power your home or business when rates are high. During a power outage, it will automatically power your home or business and make sure none of your stored energy is sent back to the grid. By localizing your energy distribution, you save money and reduce peak demand on the grid.\nIf you have a rooftop solar array, you\u2019re producing zero energy at night, and not enough during peak hours in the morning and afternoon. And that excess energy you generate during the middle of the day and sell back to the grid? It\u2019ll soon be sold at a loss (or in some cases not at all) when new changes to metering rates take effect. What you need is a way to store the solar energy you produce so you can use it whenever you need it. Orison gives you the power to do just that.\nOrison is highly intelligent and fully networked. Each unit is linked via the Orison Cloud. This integrated network uses data including utility rates, peak demand charges, weather, blackout alerts, your usage profile, and more to determine the optimal operating schedule for your device. The Orison Cloud also works collectively to make the energy grid as a whole exponentially more efficient\u2014capable of handling the growing influx of intermittent renewable energy, without the high cost of infrastructure entailed by other solutions.\n Watch Eric give a demo of our prototype\nPLAY\n\n                   When we say Orison is plug-and-play, we mean it. The future of sustainable energy depends on mass adoption. And the mass adoption of any technology begins with ease of use. That\u2019s why we designed Orison to be as effortless to install and operate as possible. Simply plug it in like you would any other appliance, and you\u2019re done. Orison automatically begins working. No permits, construction, or wiring required.\nOrison\u2019s mobile app gives you control over your system and access to its insights, wherever you are. In the event of a power outage, you\u2019ll know exactly when it happens and when the grid is restored. And you can rest assured that Orison is powering your home in the interim. The app also lets you clearly see the money your system saves you on energy. You can easily program times for charging and discharging, and seamlessly add and manage multiple Orison devices for scaled power and savings.\nOrison is expertly engineered to scale to your home or business\u2019s growing energy needs. If and when your needs exceed the capacity of your Orison configuration, simply add one or more Orison Panel+ for a fraction of the cost. Increased storage comes at a decreased price.\n     Other home energy storage systems sound like a marvel\u2014until you realize just how much installation will cost you. At Orison, our goal is to make the next generation of energy available to everyone, not just those who can afford to vacation in space.\n           The revolutionary power of Orison comes complete with a 10-year/5,000 lifecycle warranty. Orison\u2019s performance is monitored in real time by the Orison Cloud. The moment a problem is detected with any system, the Orison team is notified. We alert you of the issue, immediately ship a replacement unit to your door, complete with a return package for the defective unit. Your power storage needs will barely miss a beat.\n                   Who Can Use Orison?\nImagine a system that fits in with your space and lifestyle, saves you money today and helps build a secure energy world. Orison is a solution for any energy consumer, including homes with solar and businesses of all kinds and sizes.\nAny Energy Consumer\nOrison is the only plug-and-play energy storage system that allows every energy consumer, whether you own or rent a home, townhome, condo or apartment; have solar; or own a business, to be an active member of the energy revolution.\nIt\u2019s only natural for you to want to minimize your energy bill. Orison allows you to reduce the effects of increased charges for electricity during peak demand.\nWhen you use Orison, energy is always available to you. That means that anytime a blackout occurs and the electricity grid goes down you won't. Imagine not having to worry about whether you will maintain power in your home or business every time a storm comes through!\nEvery Orison owner also becomes a contributor to a clean, reliable energy future. Renewables are currently limited by the lack of available storage. The more people that use Orison, the more renewable energy that can be added to the grid. In addition, because energy storage can now be everywhere the grid then becomes more resilient and stable, which is the exact outcome that utilities and electricity producers are actively seeking.\nHomes With Solar\nA common theme for rooftop solar owners in many states and countries is the impending reduction of Net Metering Feed-In-Tariffs, the amount of money you receive when you sell the electricity you produce to the grid. The choice faced by rooftop solar owners is simple: either continue to sell the energy you produce at a considerable loss, or stop selling and use the energy you produce yourself.\nOrison offers the ability to store rooftop solar energy locally, which is equivalent to buying and selling at the same price. Now you can access all the benefits of having solar along with those associated with Orison energy storage!\nBusinesses of All Kinds and Sizes\nWhether you operate a shop, restaurant, hotel or an office, as a business owner you have to worry about many things. With Orison, electricity doesn't have to be one of them. Your bottom line can be improved by taking advantage of existing Time of Use rates and minimizing peak Demand Charges. You can also guarantee continuity of service to your customers during a blackout.\nIn addition to reducing costs and ensuring continuity, the Orison Panel is customizable. You can choose whether to apply your brand and look, or place them behind the fixtures and equipment you already have. Orison is your plug-and-play, smart energy business solution.\n                   We believe a bright new future is possible. We\u2019re innovative, visionary, and a little bit nuts. But when your goal is to spearhead a revolutionary movement in energy, a dash of crazy doesn\u2019t hurt. We\u2019re in this for the future of our planet. Because our vision is audacious, we count on one another to make it happen. We inspire each other to dream more, learn more, do more, and become more.\nHelming the Orison ship are three leaders with proven successes in renewable energy, consumer electronics, advanced aerospace systems, commercial land development, and more. Their combined industry experience has given them critical insight into effective energy storage distribution and networking on a massive scale.\nOrison was borne of a shared realization: a future powered by renewable energy is only possible through the mass adoption of stored energy systems to alleviate strain on the grid.\nWith this revolutionary understanding in tow, our founders leveraged their decades of expertise in examining energy efficient buildings, alternative energy sources, and the power of networked systems. Combining these technologies, they sought to create small yet fully integrated energy storage systems linked together by a massive network we call the \u201cOrison Cloud.\u201d The Orison Cloud is engineered both to save consumers money and stabilize the grid against the rapid increase of intermittent renewable energy.\nAfter refining the technical concept, developing a primary business model, interviewing loads of potential customers, and creating a business plan to finance the growth of the company, we can finally announce that Orison is poised to lead an energy storage revolution.\nWe\u2019re currently developing fully functional prototypes that will enter beta testing in Q1 FY16. With your support, we\u2019ll initiate limited production and UL certification in Q2 FY16, followed by manufacturing for commercialization!\nIt\u2019s time to rethink the power of energy. Thank you for being part of the revolution.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe believe we have most of the regulatory hurdles covered and have started working with third party compliance authorities. However, there is still a certain amount of risk to be overcome. Our technology works as described and has already overcome some difficult hurdles. We recognize that innovations frequently bump into regulatory hurdles that must be adjudicated, which is why we are participating in this rapidly changing regulatory space. We will acquire UL certification before shipping. It is important to all of our customers and the future success of Orison.\n\nWe know there can always be hurdles along the way during product development. Our experience has allowed us to mitigate much of the risk, but it still exists. We will always be transparent with our community about challenges, including these:\n\nShip Date: We are confident we will ship by the projected dates, as we have already begun the conversation with manufacturers. While there is always a chance that things will take longer than planned, we believe our experience will mitigate this.\n\nProduct Changes: As we refine Orison based on additional community feedback and more product testing, slight changes may be made. We'll only make changes that enhance the product experience.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comments": [{"username": "Simon Glover", "content": "Q2 soon to finish.

During our missions, we would camo up, travel to our hide site, and execute our orders. However, by the time we made it there, we\u2019d already sweated off most of the paint. \n What\u2019s worse, I\u2019d return with burnt and blistered skin from having been out in the sun all day. We never thought to apply sunscreen. We thought we were protected, but we weren't.\n\nPredator Warpaint was born out of a glaring need to make a better product in an industry that has failed to innovate. Current camo products leaves you exposed to the sun. They do nothing to protect your skin from harmful UV rays. You get burned which can lead to skin cancer down the line. The problem was obvious, camo face paint should do more than just conceal.\nThe answer was simple. We leveraged the latest in sunscreen technology to provide a superior product that protects the user from the sun and doesn\u2019t need to be reapplied during high perspiration activities.\nWe created Predator Warpaint.\nCreated by a Navy SEAL, Predator Warpaint is the most effective camo face paint, period. Once you put it on, it stays on and doesn\u2019t come off until you take it off.\nThe high quality formula is water resistant, sweat resistant, non-migrating, and durable during high perspiration activities. Made with SPF 50, Predator Warpaint protects your skin from harmful UV rays and helps prevent burns and skin cancer.\n\nWe have two different colors packages.\nMil-Spec Camo For Military\nWoodland Camo For Hunters and Survivalists\nIn effort to produce a military-grade camouflage face paint that also protected the skin beneath it, we worked with Navy SEALs in San Diego, California to produce a product that met their standards of performance. \nPredator Warpaint is formulated to perform in the environments where our modern warriors operate. Whether you\u2019re in the military or  hunter. Predator Warpaint is for you. Military-grade face paint designed by Warriors for Warriors.\nBy Warriors, For Warriors isn\u2019t just something we say; some of our nation\u2019s most elite warriors will be preparing for battle using our product.\nOur number one goal is to get Predator Warpaint into the hands of every active duty service member. Though we have made some significant progress exposing our new product to the military, we know that it is still going to take time to get it into every service member\u2019s hands. We are providing the option for backers to purchase Predator Warpaint and we will donate it on their behalf to Active Duty military personnel. This option will not only reassure our Kickstarter backers that their money is directly benefiting our military, but it will also expedite the adoption of a new camo product that will keep members of our military healthier. The 'Predator Protects' packages enable everyone to get behind our brand to support those men and women serving this great nation.\nMeet the Co-founder Nick Norris\nNick served in varied combat leadership roles in both Iraq and Afghanistan, fought alongside US Army Infantry and USMC Infantry, and ultimately concluded his Active Duty service as the Officer In Charge of SQT. Nick used camo face paint during his training and deployment but rarely thought about the need to apply sunscreen in conjunction with the camo. The result was often burnt and blistered skin that had been hidden under layers of traditional camo face paint which he falsely assumed would provide protection from the sun. He identified a problem, formulated a solution, and vetted the demand for a better product through his relationships in the SEAL Teams, which resulted in the creation of Predator Warpaint.\nCreated by a Navy SEAL, We, understand the need to protect and conceal and what it takes to perform at your best.\n      Designed for an outdoors lifestyle, Predator Warpaint is completely odorless, helping you get closer to game without being detected. Be a more effective hunter by concealing yourself with the highest quality grade camo face paint.\n                  We have built a product that clearly solves a problem, we see the opportunity to innovate in this space, and we intend to continue to improve our product to deliver a superior camo face paint option to our customers.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe know there can always be hurdles along the way during product development.

This is unnatural and has significant implications to our sleep, mood, immune system, weight management, and overall well-being.\nArio is a WiFi-connected lamp and lighting system that mimics the light of the sun to keep your body clock in sync and improve your health.\nArio throughout the day\nArio uses advanced LED technology and cloud connectivity to make your life healthier and easier.\n                                                Light Matters!\nHumans evolved to live according to rhythms of the sun. We respond physically and mentally to the light around us. Today, we live in a world in which our sleep/wake cycles are easily disrupted. We often feel groggy in the morning, lethargic during the day, and restless at night.\nOur bodies respond to light direction, color, intensity, and time, releasing hormones that control our body processes - physiology, sleep, metabolism, behavior, and mood. \nBased on over 15 years of scientific research from Harvard Medical School, NASA, and the NIH, Ario delivers lighting optimized for your health. \nWe created Ario to help you -\nWake up naturally with sunrise-like lighting\nIncrease focus and productivity with energizing blue-rich light \nRelax in the evening with sunset-like amber lighting\nSleep better at night\nImprove health: manage weight, reduce stress, increase antioxidant levels, and boost immune system\n                                     Imagine Your Life with Ario\nArio provides a more natural way to wake up when you want to, with gently increasing light.\nBlue-rich light energizes like a sunny day.\nArio's calming amber light creates a relaxing atmosphere.\nArio's downward-directed light prepares you for sleep. Ario can turn itself off or act as a nightlight that won't disturb sleep.\n                                             How Ario Works\nSo, how does Ario actually work? We believe technology should make our lives simpler, not more complicated as many connected home devices currently do. Ario is easy to set up and use. Just plug it in.\nSetup:\nPlug your Ario lamp into the wall.\nConnect Ario to your WiFi via a simple phone app.\nSit back and enjoy, while Ario figures out where you are and comes up with a lighting schedule that evolves with you over time.\nArio works automatically. If you unplug your lamp for days or weeks and plug it back in, Ario knows what to do, even if your WiFi is down.\nPhysical Control: User buttons (on/off, bright/dim, color) on the lamp or wall switch you already have.\nMobile and Web Access: Everything the physical controls do and more! You are in control of how to start and live your day.\nSunrise alarm\nTime zone\nSchedule update\nRemote control\nColor temperature range\nWhat about data? At Ario, we believe the data Ario learns about you are yours! You can safely and securely access your data via your personal account to see how you are living and make daily adjustments to live healthier. \nOther cool stuff: Ario can help you prepare and recover from jet lag naturally. Ario is also compatible with other connected home devices and wearables. We would love to hear your thoughts on what you might want to connect with Ario, and the data it collects.\n                                          Science Behind Ario\nDecades of research from Harvard Medical School, NASA, and leading institutions around the world have revealed a great deal of information about how light impacts and regulates our health. We designed Ario based on this large body of knowledge and on recommendations of the National Institute of Health and American Medical Association. Here is a summary.\nOur body learns what time it is from light in our environment. Non-visual photoreceptors in our eyes, discovered fairly recently, are sensitive to changing levels of blue light from above. These receptors provide signals to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a tiny region located in the hypothalamus responsible for controlling our circadian rhythm, or body clock. This in turn influences the production of hormones regulating bodily process.\nToday\u2019s static artificial lights throw off our body clock by as much as three hours. While we don\u2019t perceive this directly, this changes the balance of our endocrine system, generally reducing levels of body process regulating hormones both day and night. These changes to our basic physiology affect our metabolism which in turn impacts our sleep, behavior, mood, and general health.\nMedical and lighting professionals recommend the following to promote healthy circadian rhythm, restful sleep, and overall well-being. Ario is designed to deliver what is recommended:  \nBlue-rich light from above stimulates cortisol production in the morning to synchronize circadian rhythm and awaken, and during the day to maintain alertness.\nAmber-toned light with very little blue and a relatively dark ceiling, at the end of the day. This makes it easier to relax and prepare the body for sleep by facilitating the release of the hormone melatonin which is inhibited by typical light exposure at night.\nExamples of Those Who Have Seen the Light\nNASA  Astronauts experience extreme light conditions in space, which result in circadian rhythm disruption. Over many years, NASA has learned how to use proper lighting to help astronauts compensate for significant changes in their sleep/wake cycles.\nSeattle Mariners  Recently, the Seattle Mariners redesigned their clubhouse, introducing a state-of-the-art lighting system. Players now use blue light to recover from jet lag and prepare for games and amber light to help them wind down and recover afterwards.\n                                                Our Innovation\nWe built Ario\u2019s patent-pending combination of features specifically and uniquely to support your body clock while providing beautiful light. We\u2019ve improved upon technology that has previously been complicated and expensive, making it available for personal use. By cloud-connecting Ario via WiFi, we enable a wide array of features that can grow over time.\nLight delivery: We provide a bright, 2400 lumens, wide color range for Ario, from 6500K blue-rich white light (mid-day sun), to 1800K amber white light (candle/fire light). We selected high-performance LEDs used in large volumes by the general lighting industry to keep costs low and use custom light sources for the low end of the color range.\nDirectional control: Ario has two light engines, a purpose-built and highly-integrated LED controller, and Particle P1 WiFi module which together provide Ario\u2019s lighting power and control. To get the most brightness while maintaining comfort, we\u2019ve carefully engineered efficient large diffusers and properly shaded them to reduce glare.\nAutonomous, easy control: Ario is equipped with a battery-backed real-time clock and program storage so it operates properly, and awakes after power-down knowing what color and direction are called for, even if your router or internet is down. Ario responds to buttons on the lamp, the switch on the wall, or remotely with your mobile phone, tablet, or computer.\nLearning algorithms: Over time, Ario safely and securely identifies patterns in how you use the lamp through machine learning and refines its schedule to deliver lighting specific to your needs. It does this using cloud computing as part of the Ario web service available from anywhere.\nEnergy-efficient and long-lasting: Since Ario is solid-state, it uses only 1/5 of the energy of equivalent incandescent lighting. Our LEDs are properly driven and heatsinked to deliver more than 35,000 hours of life. The power supply is sized for minimum quiescent power draw and maximum overall efficiency. To save power further, Ario may be turned off completely like any lamp and still delivers light color and direction appropriate to your saved schedule.\n                                                Ario Spec Sheet\n                                                     Team Ario\n                                                    Our Story\nWe started with a simple concept of improving people's health through lighting. We worked through countless research papers, development projects, prototypes, tests, and early marketing activities. We've received amazing encouragement and support along the way. Now we're ready to go to market and are asking for your help to gear up for manufacturing and development.\n                                                     Timeline\n                                                     Rewards\nRewards are explained on the right above.\nShipping cost will vary depending upon the location. Shipments within the US will be $25 and will vary anywhere else in the world. If we are not able to arrange shipping, we will reimburse contributors. VAT will need to be covered by the recipient.\nArio comes with a one-year limited liability warranty that protects you against manufacturing defects.\n                                                    Resources\nWe did a lot of research in the development of Ario.

That's how we are committing to change the future of food, and we're proud to start with the Grove Ecosystem. \nWe want to hear from you!\nIf you have questions, please give us a call (1-844-457-8500) or email us at kickstarter@grovelabs.io. We're available from 9a-9p EST and will do our best to respond to all email inquiries within a few hours. Thanks so much!\n    We have two more stops in our nationwide Ecosystem demo tour! Register for SF and Brooklyn here using the code \"friendofgrove\" for free admission!\nIf you're not able to join us on the road, you can register for a personal video demo over Skype here. \nAs Seen In...\nThe Grove Ecosystem is an intelligent, indoor garden that makes it possible to grow fresh, flavorful, and nutrient-rich food year round.\nA Grove Ecosystem provides you with fresh, healthy produce, brings light and fresh air into your home, and empowers you to understand how to grow your own food.\nThe Ecosystem uses fish, plants, and beneficial microbes to reliably grow delicious produce - including vegetables, herbs, and small fruits - in a space the size of a bookshelf. Through the mobile app, Grove OS, you'll not only be able to control and automate the Ecosystem, but access decades of indoor growing knowledge which will in turn allow you to grow the healthiest, freshest produce for you and your family. \nThe Ecosystem is a living system.\nAt the intersection of hardware, software, and ecology, the Ecosystem is a thoughtfully crafted fun, educational, and rewarding experience.\nGetting started is easy. The Ecosystem ships with everything you need to get up and running immediately. Grove OS walks you through the entire process - from planting your first seeds, to adding fish to your tank, to harvesting your first crops. As your seeds turn into sprouts and your plants become ready to harvest, Grove OS measures the health of your system and lets you know when to step in. In just a month and a half you can expect to be harvesting fresh, organic produce!\nThere are thousands of unique edible plants you can grow. Typical grocery stores carry about 50-60. \nThe Grove Ecosystem will expand your palette, helping you grow a wide variety of plants from herbs to leafy greens to fruiting crops. Here's a shortlist of crops our early customers have been successfully growing in Ecosystem prototypes! \nPlease refer to the FAQ section for a full list of what can be grown in the Ecosystem.\nOur ecology team has been extensively researching the growing best practices which have been integrated into the Grove OS mobile app. Simply tell Grove OS what you have planted, and the Ecosystem automates lighting, watering, and fans to optimize the growth of your crops.\nTrust the food you eat, because you grew it.\nGrowing Technical Specifications\nGrow Area: MGB - 25.25 x 11.5 in / SGB - 20 x 10.5 inches \nCanopy Clearance: MGB - 28 in / SGB - 8 in\nRoot Zone Depth: MGB - 8 in / SGB - 3 in\nGrow Medium: Clay Pebbles\n MGB = Main Grow Bed / SGB = Seedling and Greens Bed\nAquaponics in Action\nThe Ecosystem utilizes a natural process called aquaponics, which harnesses the relationships between beneficial bacteria, fish, and plants to reliably grow fresh, delicious produce. \nThe fish process the food they are fed and produce ammonia-rich waste. Beneficial microbes convert the ammonia to nitrates (organic plant fertilizer), simultaneously supplying the plants with nutrients and the fish with clean water!\nAs a result of this natural process, you don't have to clean the tank, wash your greens, or worry about the freshness of your food! \nIntelligent and ecologically sound, the Grove Ecosystem, is designed to look beautiful in the home, grow fresh and flavorful food, and engage and inspire you, your family, and your friends. Over time, the system learns with you by collecting data and helping you optimize for flavor, freshness, and yield.\nA Connected, Intelligent Device\nThe Ecosystem creates an ideal environment for your fish and plants by controlling lights, fans, and pumps based on readings from air temperature, humidity, water temperature, and water level sensors. All the tools and training you need to become an aquaponics expert are wrapped up into a fun experience on your phone. Visualize your progress, track plant growth, and diagnose problems instantly.\nSmart sensors and Wi-Fi connectivity help you cultivate a healthy Ecosystem 24/7.\nFull Spectrum, Adjustable LED Lights\nCustom-engineered by our electrical engineering team, the Ecosystem's LEDs are full spectrum (2000K \u2013 5000K), fully dimmable, and automated to mimic the sun to power optimal photosynthesis. The lights can also be vertically adjusted to the height of your plants to maximize their growing efficiency.\nThe Ecosystem contains white LED panels that not only look great in the home, but are best-in-class grow lights.\nA Large Main Growing Area\nThe Ecosystem boasts a grow bed with 305 sq inches of grow area and a depth of 8 inches for plenty of healthy root space. With a constant supply of water, nutrients and quality light you can expect a higher level of production than typically seen in an outdoor garden. Additionally, you can plant your crops much denser than in outdoor soil. \nWhen planted with heirloom lettuce and starting seeds in the dedicated seedling area, you'll harvest the freshest greens every night (about the equivalent of about 2-3 bags of salad greens every week or 8 - 10 heads of lettuce every 20 days).\nTomatoes to cilantro. Peppers to arugula. Harvest a bounty with plenty of grow space.\nMicrogreens and Seedling Bed\nThe Ecosystem's seedlings and greens bed (SGB) is 230 square inches and perfect for seedlings and microgreens. Once your seedlings are ready, move them to the upper grow bed and watch them reach maturity. \nIncrease your productivity with dedicated seedling grow space.\nSelf-Filtering Aquarium\nThe Ecosystem's 25 gallon fish tank is where the aquaponic cycle starts. Incorporating integrated aeration and lighting, the 3/8 inch thick acrylic housing is the home for your fish, shrimp, and snails as they create the waste that eventually becomes the fertilizer that is cycled throughout the system. \nNaturally balanced as part of the larger ecosystem, this stunning aquatic habitat will replace your flat screen TV.\nIntegrated Storage Space\nDesigned into the front panel of the Ecosystem is an inconspicuous storage area and workbench for many of the tools you need - seed packets, fish food, nutrient supplements, scissors, and an aquaponics test kit (for testing pH, ammonia, nitrite, and nitrates). See the FAQ for everything that is included in your Ecosystem purchase. \nIntegrated storage and work surface for everything you need to tend to your ecosystem.\nHardware Technical Specifications\nDimensions: 34\" W x 16\" D x 54-75\" T\nWeight: 115lbs Empty / 400lbs Full\nEnergy Use: 112 kWh / month*  \nWood: Amber bamboo\nGrove OS is designed so you can keep it simple with default settings, or delve in and finely tune all aspects or your Ecosystem. We've programmed the app with decades of growing knowledge to intelligently control your Ecosystem and serve as a handy gardening guide.\nPlant Presets\nEcosystem Controls\nOur custom LED lights are controlled right from your phone. Presets make harvesting in the dark or Instagramming your luscious greens as easy as opening your phone. \nGrove Almanac\nEverything you need to be an expert. Our knowledge base on smart indoor gardening, aquaponics, and ecology is constantly growing, including hacks and DIY projects to help you explore! \nPush Notifications\nNature is at work in your Ecosystem, and Grove OS is your translator. Plant and fish tracking combine with sensor data to give you timely notifications about what your system needs.\nVacation Mode\nGrove OS puts your lights in low-energy mode and conserves water, making it safe to leave an Ecosystem unattended for over a week. \nGrove OS Technical Specifications\nControl: Watering, Light cycles, Light spectrum, Light intensity, Airflow sensor readings, System status warnings\nCompatibility: iOS (March 2016), Android (April 2016)\nWhether you're planting your first seed or you live in the soil for half the year, feel at home in our thriving community! We're ready and excited to support you every step of the way.\nGrove Community\nGrove Community is an online platform to connect with other Grove growers, fresh food enthusiasts, and passionate aquaponic growers.

No question is too small (or too complex). We're here for emotional and technical support!\nOur support team loves assisting and empowering our Grove growers with all the resources and tips they need to be successful!\nRight Now, 50 Early Adopters in Boston Love Their (prototype) Grove Ecosystems \nThese prototypes (which look a bit different from the Grove Ecosystem we're excited to share with you today) have been used and loved by 50 Early Adopters in Boston for the past six months. See what they have to say about their Grove growing experience:\nWe've iterated on our design based on feedback from our Boston Early Adopters. The new Ecosystem has improved Wi-Fi connectivity, a 1.5x larger gardening bed, and a 3x larger aquarium (for healthier, happier fish). Additionally, we've optimized the LEDs for better growing, added a dedicated grow space for seedlings and microgreens, and have refined Grove OS. \nLike you saw above with our Boston Early Adopter program, this isn't our first rodeo. We already have an assembly line in place, fully built out hardware, software, and ecology teams, and have already delivered 50 prototype units. We have the same hardware vendors, 9+ months of ecology testing, and a new mobile app far into development. This is our month-by-month plan from now until delivery: \nThe Ecosystem runs on the Photon microcontroller and the Particle platform. This open-source, cloud platform made it quick to get started, and gives us a straightforward path to production and scale. With the Photon, setting up the Ecosystem on wifi and pushing out firmware updates over-the-air are simple, well-tested processes. We\u2019ve been working with the Particle team for the past year and are significant contributors to their software projects.\nYou're Supporting a Passionate, Dedicated, Experienced, and Revolutionary Team\nWe\u2019re a passionate team of MIT engineers, entrepreneurs and inventors, modern farmers, Harvard biologists, designers, food lovers, and impact-driven problem solvers dedicated to developing technology, products, and experiences that enable more people to grow their own food in productive home ecosystems. We're united by our desire to positively change our world, and we believe that starts with food and sustainability. \nOur core team brings wisdom and experience from SpaceX, Apple, the United States Air Force, the Australian Army, NOLS, GrabCAD, and an ecosystem research farm in West Virginia. Our backgrounds are diverse, but we\u2019re united by a common mission. We're also fortunate to have a group of advisors, partners, and investors who are contributing their wisdom, capabilities, and networks to help us maximize our positive impact.\nFrom Our Founders: It's time we learn to live with nature, not against it.\nOur reason for starting this project is simple: food production is unsustainable and unhealthy. Co-founders Gabe and Jamie lived together in an MIT fraternity in winter of 2013 when Jamie, frustrated with the current state of food and agriculture, took matters into his own hands and built an aquaponics system in their shared room. After loving that first system, Gabe and Jamie decided to build a beautiful, fun solution to this problem by combining an indoor garden and a Farmville-like mobile app.\nFollow us on this adventure!\n* Based on typical monthly usage. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe plan on being transparent with our process and challenges. \n\nSimilar to many Kickstarter projects, we face several risks and challenges in sparking this growing revolution. Unlike many Kickstarter projects, we have raised outside venture capital and, as a team, we already have built and shipped over 50 of our beta prototypes.\n\nTo further de-risk our project, our fantastic investors have offered Grove an additional capital immediately following the campaign if we are successful in reaching a certain Kickstarter funding goal. This capital will accelerate us towards a company that can deliver on the Grove Ecosystem, and also begin development on future products and services that can help educate and inspire even more people on healthy food, indoor growing, and aquaponics.\n\nPrimary risks for us include:\n\nENGINEERING\n\nTo achieve the level of simplicity in user experience that we aspire to, we have to finalize design and engineering on a complex system. We have taken two key steps to ensure our engineering success. 1) We have formed an amazing, experienced team of engineers and designers, and 2) we have tested our prototypes for over a year. We've built seven generations of prototypes culminating in a prototype \"Early Adopter\" production run (50 Grove EA Ecosystems are growing in homes around the Boston area). We've already ironed out all the kinks and we're harnessing enormous amounts of data (both qualitative and quantitative) to guide our future work.\n\nSUPPLY CHAIN AND LOGISTICS\n\nMany Kickstarter campaigns encounter problems when taking their prototypes to production, often stemming from issues finding suppliers and engineering products for mass-production. Smooth execution is essential to overcoming supply chain and logistics risks. Enough capital is also critical. We take this lesson seriously and have been working for months negotiating with suppliers, testing component quality, and building a team that can execute on our plan. We have already done a small scale assembly run of 50+ EA Ecosystems, and although our design has improved significantly with all the feedback, we will be using mostly the same manufacturing partners, processes, and logistics. Our plans are in place, and we now mainly require the resources, backing, and support to execute them!\n\nTEAM\n\nFinding the right people is a challenge for any endeavor. Success in such a complex and multi-disciplinary field as indoor growing requires a team of talented, passionate, and motivated designers, engineers, ecologists and entrepreneurs. We have formed a talented, passionate, fun team, but we will have to recruit more Grovers to realize our vision :) We're excited about that as we believe our team is our strongest asset.

This patent-pending design utilizes a piezoelectric atomizer, which converts water into vapor, instead of using a high-powered mister. \nWhat Makes It Different Than Any Other Aeroponic or Hydroponic System? \nAeroPro was intentionally designed to be a compact grow system. Most hydroponic and aeroponic systems need a lot of space and power to function, and not everyone has that space. We challenged ourselves to create something that was small enough to fit in an apartment kitchen, and efficient enough to produce and sustain extremely healthy plants. Here are just a few benefits to gardening with AeroPro:\nDesigned With The Environment In Mind.\nAeroPro is environmentally friendly and energy efficient. The system works on only 4 watts of energy, and can be plugged into any USB port or electrical outlet. Its automatic shut off, will eliminate any worry about it overheating or shorting out if you accidentally leave it on.\nPower It With The Sun.\nAeroPro runs on solar!\nUse Less Water!\nAeroPro uses \u00bc cup of water for every 4 hours of run time, eliminating the need for large reservoirs which produce significant water waste. Plants will only absorb what they need, and the excess moisture will evaporate. \nWe\u2019ve made it simple. \nWith AeroPro, you no longer have to worry about overwatering your plants. Just transplant them into a soilless substrate such as coconut bark or sphagnum moss and turn on the system. It\u2019s that simple.\nThe system has successfully grown and sustained a variety of plants. We have tested herbs, vegetables, fruit and florals. It has germinated tomato seeds in as few as 2 days, and has even extended the bloom time of an orchid up to 8 months. \nWe\u2019re planting a seed starting with the Kickstarter community, and would like to offer you an opportunity to support this project. We have some great rewards available only to our Kickstarter backers, so make sure to select a pledge and let\u2019s grow something together.\nProduction Timeline\nWe have spent the last 3 years designing, and testing several iterations of this product, and are finally ready to go to market.

Plants and fish - thriving together in a stylish, simple-to-maintain aquaponics system. Keep a piece of nature wherever you are.\nUnlike other systems on the market, Vita has no mechanical filters to change because it uses a natural aquaponic system to clean itself. The plant naturally filters your water creating a clean habitat for your fish. Every element works together for easy maintenance without any of the hassle.\nIt's minimalistic aesthetic brings out the best in your plants brightening up any room. The elegant design brings tranquility into your home or work space. Scientific studies have shown that a plant-rich environment can boost creativity and productivity while aquarium keeping has a significant effect in reducing levels of stress and anxiety.\n                                              Staying true to nature, we\u2019ve designed the Vita to work without using electricity. Zero electricity means no wires, meaning you can place your Vita wherever you want. It's compact, portable, and blends into any space anywhere.\n                                              The sleek, elegant design complements any room the Vita is placed in. Vita uses high quality SuperBright\u2122 5mm glass making it extremely durable and provides excellent viewing properties to see the fish. Each tank is different with hand selected natural stones included in each individual Aquascaping kit. The sustainable plant media retains moisture and provides the perfect ventilation for plant roots.\nAn optional touch LED lighting system is available to be included with your order. The plant light allows you to grow your Vita in locations that doesn\u2019t have sunlight available allowing you to truly grow your Vita anywhere. The underwater light allows you to view your compact ecosystem at night. It even has a built in 10 hr timer! The RGB backlight allows you to customize your tank further and enjoy color therapy too.\nSee the Touch LED Light and remote (stretch goal) in action!\nPLAY\n\nThe Vita is a low-maintenance aquarium that uses aquaponics to keep the plant and fish happy and healthy. Vita is simple to maintain because there are no working parts. You don\u2019t need to maintain or change a filter.\nSimply pour water into the aquarium, grow your plant, and watch it clean itself! It\u2019s so easy anybody can do it!\nOver-watering and under-watering are two of the biggest problems that result in poor plant growth. With the Vita, the plants naturally take water from the tank as needed so that you don\u2019t have to water them yourself reducing the amount of water used up to 90%. This allows your houseplants to grow healthy and happy.\n                                              Looking to get Vita international?\nPlease message us directly and we can discuss shipping rates!\nWant to \"add-on\" to your pledge? Here's how it works.\n1. Choose a reward level. \nEverybody must choose one (and only one) reward level to back this project. You cannot choose 2 reward levels. Just one. You will get all items in that reward. \n2. Increase your pledge amount to match the cost of the Add-On item you'd like.\nFor example, if you pledged $30 for the \"VITA VIP SPECIAL\" and you also want a Betta Fish ($7) and a LED Light and Transformer ($24), you would simply add $31 to your $30 pledge. So your pledge would be $61 total plus shipping.\n3. Relax, you're all done!\nAt the end of the campaign we will send a survey to confirm everything like shipping information & add-on specifics.

However, once I got a shipment e-mail, I was checking the tracking every day! I started setting it up last night and I'm very impressed with some aspects and a little disappointed with others. I hope there will be a survey to fill out so that you all will be able to combine and analyze all of this feedback. The glass aquarium is beautiful! I have no issues with it not being square or having messy glue. There was a little bit of glue remnants on one side but they wiped away easily. I love the mesh bag that was included. This solves the problem I always have with worrying about tiny rocks going down the drain. I love the look the LED light gives the tank but did expect it to be cordless. I am disappointed with the heater. The campaign showed a flat heater that would hide under the rocks. Now, it's taking up space inside and doesn't look so elegant. In addition, the heater has no on/off option. If it's plugged in, it's on. This tells me that it will continually heat the water so now I have to go purchase a thermometer to add to the set-up. No matter what type I get, this will degrade the look of the tank even more. Additionally, I'm going to have to continually monitor the temperature and unplug the heater when it gets to the top limit of the acceptable temperature and then plug it back in when the water starts to cool too much. I'm going to have to do this over and over. Hopefully, it doesn't get too hot too fast. I think my fish would appreciate stable temperatures. As others have mentioned, the planting instructions are not included with the tank instructions. I'm not sure why especially when the LED light instructions ARE included. Seeing as the plant is a major aspect of the Vita, it doesn't make much sense that the customer is asked to research the plant instructions. Lastly, from what I can figure out, it seems the Pachypodium and Desert Rose need a warm environment. Since this is not the case with my house, I'm not sure how they will do. I'm going to try them but, I feel like they will not do well. I expect to go through the wheatgrass pretty quickly as I believe it's a fast growing plant. Once I have to pull it out, I'm going to have to go on the hunt for a plant that will grow in the tray and be appropriate for my home. My betta seems to love his new home.

He followed my finger and always waited to be fed in the morning. My sister's was a bit more cranky and got agitated quickly. If you're ordering a Betta with your Vita, it will be a surprise as to which color Betta you will get and what kind of personality they will have.

The first month, you\u2019ll get the GoPiGo robot car, and every month after that you will be assigned a mission to accomplish! Each month, your GoBox will include a new sensor and step-by-step instructions on how to accomplish a mission -- complete with illustrations and links to helpful videos.\nWe believe that the more someone knows about the way technology works, the more effective and successful they will be in any career they choose. However, the way that technology - like engineering and computer science - is taught, caters to those with a specific style of learning, and can often be boring and frustrating for many of us because it requires so much background knowledge.\nTo solve this, we\u2019re making an easy-to-use robot kit that will enable and excite anyone with any background to learn about coding and technology.\nWith the GoBox, you and your child can explore robotics and programming together, from the beginning. If your skills are more advanced, your monthly GoBox still gives you a fun way to connect, create, and explore new concepts alongside your child, niece or grandchild.\nStretch Goals!\nWe've reached our initial funding goals rather quickly so we are laying out some stretch goals!\nStretch Goal 1 ($60,000): We heart Python.  If we reach this stretch goal, we will create parallel materials for each lesson in Python.\nStretch Goal 2 ($100,000): Where do robots come from?  We'll develop a feature video that explains how we design and manufacture our robot.\nWhat is the GoPiGo? \nThe GoPiGo is the foundation of GoBox. GoPiGo is a robot car we designed, built, and launched last year. With the awesome feedback we received from thousands of users and our thriving, creative community, we have learned how to make it easier to assemble, more durable, and a lot more fun to use! All of these improvements will be included in the GoPiGo2, as a part of this GoBox Kickstarter! \nProgramming \nThe GoPiGo is built around a really neat $35 single board computer called the Raspberry Pi (the green board in the picture below). It was developed by a UK foundation a few years back and has taken the education world by storm -- making it easier than ever for young people to get their hands on electronics and learn to program. It's easy to use, and we think it's the best platform for beginners because it doesn't require any prior knowledge. \nRead more about the Raspberry Pi and the Non-Profit Foundation that supports it here.\nThe GoBox and the GoPiGo Raspberry Pi Robot Car are part of the Open Source Hardware Community.\nProgramming Languages\nYou can program the GoPiGo in many languages including Python, Scratch, Node.js, and Go. Our awesome community has even developed Windows10 for the GoPiGo! Don't know what any of these languages are?  Don't worry, GoPiGo helps you learn the basic coding languages.\nWhen we looked at how to make GoBox accessible and engaging for all skills levels, we decided that developing the missions for the GoPiGo in Scratch was the best option. \nProgramming the GoPiGo in Scratch\nScratch is an easy drag and drop language developed at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for teaching new programmers how to code. Rather than typical lines of code, you\u2019ll use simple shapes and graphics to program your robot.\nWhy a monthly subscription? \nIt\u2019s the gift that keeps on giving. Your monthly GoBox comes with a new sensor for your robot to help you accomplish a mission. Each mission builds on the next, so you are learning new skills and staying engaged over a period of time -- which we believe is the key to success! \nWhat\u2019s a Mission? \nWhat\u2019s more exciting than going on a mission? Our team of illustrators, animators, teachers, engineers and designers are crafting beautiful and easy to understand materials that lead you through a story that helps you accomplish something cool with your GoPiGo and each new sensor. \nCheck out this sample robot Mission, which not only teaches concepts about biomimicry but does so in a way that explains programming concepts like if and else statements, how robots read sensor data, concepts like thresholds, and math concepts like averages and how they apply to coding.\nClick This Picture to View a Sample Mission (PDF)\nEach Mission will be accompanied with helpful videos to get you started and walk you through certain parts of the Mission.\nEngineering Concepts  \nEach mission has fundamental engineering principles woven into the mission. The GoBox teaches new ways to think about how to approach and solve problems.\nEach mission presents a problem and provides the tools to approach and solve the problem in your own unique way. Our missions encourage the design theory approach: state the problem, design, build, code, test, and iterate.\nThis allows students to find their own answers, and encourages them to come up with their own missions!\nProgramming Concepts: Making them real.\nWith GoBox, you\u2019re not just playing with a robot, you\u2019re actually learning programming concepts without it ever feeling like a computer science class. A robot makes the whole coding and programming experience tangible and real.\nSome of the concepts that are taught in the 12 GoBox missions include: program structure, if then statements, forever until control structures, variables, loops, nesting loops, waits, sequencing, state machine, inputs and outputs, broadcasting, conditional statements, iteration, variables, random numbers, event handling, parallel execution, and boolean logic.  \nAren't sure of what all of these terms mean? No problem - that is exactly what GoBox is meant to help teach.\nNot just a toy.\u2026\nSince GoPiGo can also be programmed in Python, Go, Node.js and a growing list of other languages supported by our community, when you or your child outgrows Scratch, a whole world of powerful programming languages awaits! Also, because the GoPiGo is open source, our active community is constantly adding new examples, languages, and features. \nOur Favorite Reward - GoBox - The Basic Package. \nThe full package. You get the upgraded GoPiGo2 full robot kit delivered to your door before the Holidays. Then, over the next 11 months, we\u2019ll send you a fun new mission for your robot to accomplish with a sensor. The missions are in a story form of step-by-step instructions that take you through the whole experience. You\u2019ll have full access to our video library and support forums as well. The monthly sensors include the light sensor, sound sensor, ultrasonic sensor, buzzer, LED, motion sensor, button sensor, infrared sensor, and the brand new GoPiGo Line Follower.\nRewards\nGoBox Hardware and Rewards\nGoPiGo2 - the new and improved version of the GoPiGo! You\u2019ll get the brand new version of the GoPiGo robot for the Raspberry Pi. The robot is easy to assemble and turns your Raspberry Pi into a robot car! (works with all versions of the Raspberry Pi)\nPrinted Missions - Each mission comes as a full color printed booklet. For those that already own a GoPiGo, these missions, the software, and the sensors will work with the older version of the GoPiGo as well as the GoPiGo2.\nAdditional Supplies - Each mission will come with additional supplies to help you add more functions to your GoPiGo in order to accomplish the missions.\nGoPiGo Line Follower - The GoPiGo Line Follower sensor helps you program the GoPiGo to find and follow lines written on a surface.  \nCamera - The Raspberry Pi camera is a 5 megapixel camera that connects directly to the Raspberry Pi on the GoPiGo. The camera can be used to take pictures, stream video, and track objects. \nServo Kit - The Servo Kit mounts to the front of the GoPiGo, and enables things to rotate on the GoPiGo. You can connect an ultrasonic sensor, Raspberry Pi camera or other sensor to the servo to get it rotating independently from the GoPiGo.\nLight Sensor - The light sensor detects different levels of light around the GoPiGo, and enables you to program the robot to react to those readings in whatever way you choose!\nSound Sensor - The sound sensor reads the level of noise around the GoPiGo and enables you to use that data to make the GoPiGo react to changes in noise.\nUltrasonic Sensor - The ultrasonic sensor tells how far the GoPiGo is from a solid object. It can be used to measure distance from a wall, person, or another object.\nBuzzer - The buzzer adds sound and alerts to the GoPiGo. Make a sound with the GoPiGo to send alerts or scare your cats! \nLED - The LED adds lights to your GoPiGo. This LED can be attached to the GoPiGo to add a little personalization, help debug programs, and light up the room.\nMotion Sensor - The motion sensor detects moving objects around the GoPiGo.\nButton - Add a button to your GoPiGo. You can plug the button sensor into the GoPiGo to command the robot to move different ways, and do different things.\nInfrared Sensor - Send commands to your GoPiGo with your TV remote or other infrared based remote controller.\nReward Tiers\nThe GoPiGo2 - Get just the robot. You already have a Pi.  GoPiGo2 is our latest version of the GoPiGo Raspberry Pi robot car. Easier to assemble, more durable, and more fun! \nSix Month Mission - If you already own a GoPiGo, you can test the waters with six months worth of missions (1/2 of the sensors).\nTwelve Month Mission - If you already own a GoPiGo, you can get 12 robot missions -- with the full set of sensors. A GoBox will be delivered to your doorstep every month for a full year!\nThe Early Bird GoBox - Get the robot and all the missions! You'll get a box every month for a year with a mission and a sensor. We'll ship you the new GoPiGo2 in time for the Holidays!\nThe Six Month Mission + GoPiGo2 - If you want to test the waters with six months of missions and still need the GoPiGo.

You\u2019ll arrive in Shenzhen, China where you will get a full factory tour, a visit to Huaqiangbei, the world\u2019s premier electronics market, and we'll treat you to the best cuisine Southern China has to offer!  We'll throw in a free personal translator as well!\nCustom GoBox Colors\nWant a color other than clear?  If you choose the The Custom GoBox Backer Level, you will be able to choose the color for your GoPiGo2 robot body.  We will offer the following custom colors:  \nBlue body.\nWooden body.\nPurple Body\nNeon Frame\nWhere we\u2019ve been.  \nWhen the Raspberry Pi first came out, we realized the power of this little $35 computer -- not only in getting people interested in technology, but learning about robotics! We saw the robot trapped inside each Raspberry Pi that we believe has mass appeal to all kinds of learners.\nWe tested the idea through a Kickstarter campaign for the GoPiGo 1, and were overwhelmed by the response. \nSince then, we have been doing everything we can to gather feedback and build a better robot that is easier and even more fun to use!\nFulfilling our Previous Kickstarter\nWe\u2019ve shipped thousands of GoPiGos and received fantastic feedback from our engaged and creative community. We still weren\u2019t getting where we wanted to be though: a robot that anyone, with any background, can use.\nGoBox Testing with Parents\nWe wanted to make it even easier to get started with coding and robotics, so we assembled a team to make a system that could help anyone, with any background learn robotics. And, after redesigning our hardware, software, and now developing missions that pull it all together, we think we\u2019ve done it -- GoBox!\nFor the past few months we\u2019ve been designing, redesigning, and testing our new materials with groups of parent-child teams, and transforming our lessons into missions that teach robotics in a fun way.\nTeam\nWe\u2019re devoted to robotics education. Our company has been around for five years, and we are passionate about designing and making robots that people enjoy using.\nJohn - All around nice guy. When not answering questions on our forum or thinking up new robots, John is helping Karan keep our code fresh. John founded Dexter Industries.\nTaryn - Customer experience wizard. Taryn has many hats at Dexter Industries, but the most important one is keeping customers happy and making sure we\u2019re all learning.\nBridget - Bridget is an engineer, a teacher, and mom. She\u2019s the fantastic writer that designed our missions, brought them to life, and even did some early testing with them on her own kids!\nKaran - Code and Hardware Ninja. Karan is always either writing new code or helping others write their own. He\u2019s constantly answering questions, improving the code for our projects, and making things better, easier, faster.\nDrake - Illustrator extraordinaire. Drakes work speaks for itself: he designed all the beautiful pictures on this page! He is also our lead designer for the GoBox.\nAmanda - Key Account Queen. Amanda makes sure we deliver on our promises by making sure every product makes it to the customer. She's managed our Kickstarter rewards before, so we got this.\nAmber - Customer Success Angel. Amber is on the front lines listening to customers and helping them find what they need. She's a positive force of nature that gets us all organized and operating smoothly.\nOur Community and Support\nBy far the biggest accomplishment with the GoPiGo has been establishing an open, supportive and growing community. Our inspiration, the source of our feedback, and our wellspring of ideas has been the Dexter Industries community. \nBy backing our project, you become part of that community, and with it, get access to a wide breadth of knowledge and support that is shared on our forums, newsletters, Facebook, and Github.\nWe take immense pride in having three successful Kickstarters under our belt! We\u2019re getting pretty good at figuring out the manufacturing side of a successful Kickstarter project, and making sure we deliver what we promise.\nHow we\u2019re using backer contributions.\nWe\u2019re developing curriculum. GoBox is a sequence of missions designed to take you step-by-step through your journey of learning programming and robotics. In order to do this well, we have illustrators, designers and artists, working alongside engineers and professional educators that have developed curriculums and learning programs for decades. Everyone on our team is passionate about developing the most effective and engaging program that\u2019s out there!\nManufacturing robots!\nWe\u2019re setting up the tooling, designing beautiful packaging, and building systems for testing the GoPiGo2, the Line Follower, and other sensors included in your GoBox.\nHow\u2019d we come up with these goals?\nBased on our past experience of what it takes to do these types of projects, we\u2019ve set our goal at $30,000. We\u2019ll be able to deliver a high quality program that will thrill any adult-child team. However, surpassing that goal will allow us to develop even cooler missions \u2014 so if you want to see how crazy things could get, share with your friends, family and school.\nTimeline\nDelivery by the Holidays!\nDelivery by the Holiday Season! We\u2019re committing to getting the first GoBox to our backers in time for the 2015 Holiday Season (latest delivery of Dec 20th).\nEvery month after...\nWhat\u2019s better than getting a robot for Christmas? Well, GoBox is even better because it\u2019s the gift that keeps on giving \u2014 with a new mission and equipment delivered every month for the rest of the year!\nWhere we\u2019re at right now...\nAs of our launch, we have the hardware and software designed and prototyped. We have a manufacturing plan in place as well as agreements setup with our suppliers. All that\u2019s waiting on the hardware end is for us to give the signal!\nGoPiGo Raspberry Pi Line Follower Prototype\nWe have the first few lessons written (see our example lesson here!), tested, and graphically illustrated. We\u2019re working on the next eight, with most of the content developed. Over the next three months we will have these final lessons tested, iterated on, illustrated, and polished.\nGoPiGo Robot\nShare\nPlease share this with friends, family, and colleagues to help us bring this to life!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with all hardware projects, the risk of delays is possible.

Pars or better are shown in white, while bogeys or worse are shown in red. This way you can see what strategy works the best for you. You can also compare the performance and outcomes of using different clubs on the tee. In the end, you can make better decisions based on the real data from your own rounds.\nQuick and easy setup\nSimply screw a tag into the back of each club. 15 tags are included.\nWhen you scan a tag with your phone for the first time, Golf Pad prompts you to select the club. Club pairings are saved under your account, so that you never need to repeat that step again.\nStretch goal - GOLF TAGS in BLACK\nWe are excited to announce that GOLF TAGS will be available in STEALTH BLACK if we can reach $50,000 in funding! Please rally your friends, shout out on social networks and let's make this happen! \nThere is no separate reward for the black version. If the goal is met, all backers will have the option to select their preferred color at the end of the project. Note, the black version will ship 2-3 weeks later than the blue one. \nHow does it work?\nGOLF TAGS rely on Near Field Communication (NFC) technology. Each tag has a small, unique radio token inside. When you tap the tag to the phone, it records current location and club choice. Since it knows where each shot started and ended, it can compute every shot\u2019s distance and statistics. You can see, edit and share the results in real time, right on your phone.\nThe tags inside are passive radios, so you never need to replace or recharge the batteries. \nSystem requirements and technical details\nGOLF TAGS work on phones running Android 4.0 or higher equipped with NFC radio. Most modern phones have one, see the complete list here.\nNFC radio is only active while the phone screen is on. So Golf Pad introduced the innovative 'SmartLock' mode. It keeps the screen on, reduces brightness to save energy, and blocks on-screen controls to prevent accidental inputs. More information about using SmartLock during the round is available here.\nContinuous GPS and NFC usage increase battery drain. Most users can finish a 4 hour round with 25-50% of battery left. If you have an older phone or tend to run out of juice before the end of the day, we recommend turning off account sync and Wi-Fi while playing. And if you plan to play two rounds on the same day, be sure to bring a portable charger - you can get one under $20 on Amazon.\niPhone user? Unfortunately Golf Tags are only compatible with Android at this time. While iPhone 6 has NFC radio built-in, it is currently restricted to Apple Pay. The good news is you can still use the Golf Pad app on iPhone as a rangefinder and scorecard. We hope to be able to make Golf Tags available for the iPhone in the future.\nOur team and story\nSeattle team\nEngineering team in Novosibirsk, Russia\nGolf Pad started in 2011 with a golf app for Android and then expanded to iPhone. Over the years it became a top-rated choice for golfers, praised for ease of use, yet loaded with features. \nWe were one of the pioneers of tee-to-green shot tracking. Our users loved the insights that gave them, but said it takes a lot of work to track every shot by pulling out and unlocking the phone. That's how we came up with GOLF TAGS.\nAt the PGA Merchandise Show in Orlando\nWe announced GOLF TAGS at the PGA Merchandise Show in Orlando, built the initial batch and used it to validate the design and functionality. We received tons of user feedback that helped us further improve the product. The first batch is almost sold out. \nNow we need your help to build the next iteration of the hardware and expand the software. The tags design is getting improved with slicker profile and extended holding surface. Packaging is greatly improved too. The money we raise on Kickstarter will be used to fund the new injection molds, scale the production, build the new packaging, and add more game analysis features within the app and on the web. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGolf Tags are nearly complete. We've had a chance to validate the product in various environments, on multiple Android devices, and in different countries. \n\nSupply Chain Risk\nWe partnered with CMF Industries, a well-established manufacturing company headquartered in Washington state to manage manufacturing and supply. CMF has over 25 years of experience manufacturing parts and products of various complexity, both domestically and in China. We expect a smooth ride. However, component delays and unexpected shortages can occur. If this happens, we\u2019ll be sure to keep you informed and work to quickly solve the problem.\n\nSoftware Risk\nSome of the features listed above are currently under development. This includes the intelligent club recommendations and the Tournament Edition of the Golf Pad app. We have many years of software expertise and we believe the features are on track for June delivery. However, unexpected delays may occur. If this happens we will communicate our progress and work on adding the features as quickly as possible while maintaining high quality.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #10", "update_userinfo": "Magellan Echo Fit shipping update", "update_content": "The wait is over!

Coffee drinkers receive excellent quality green coffee beans and can roast them how they want, and coffee producers get reinvestment to help improve coffee quality which will generate more income.\nIKAWA will re-invest 10% of profits into coffee quality improvement projects led by the Caf\u00e9direct Producers' Foundation (CPF) in Africa and Latin America. CPF will also distribute micro-roasters funded via our \u00a320 reward scheme. Roasters will be used to support smallholder farmers test and learn more about the quality of their own coffee \u2013 something they very rarely have the opportunity to do. CPF works with a network of 280,000 smallholder farmers globally, which makes them an ideal partner to achieve a greater impact, rather than setting up our own distribution scheme. This also means we can focus our energy on delivering the first batch of Home Roasters to our backers!\nOur Story\nIKAWA inventor Andrew grew up in developing countries where his dad worked with coffee farmers. It was this experience that gave him the idea for the micro-roaster, which he designed while studying at the Royal College of Art in London 6 years ago. IKAWA has gone on to be a finalist for Best New Product at Speciality Coffee Association of Europe (SCAE) 2012 for the first Professional Roaster and was finalist in Business Global Social Venture Competition of Berkeley University in 2011.  \nAndrew, together with co-founder Rombout Frieling, made hundreds working prototypes before launching the IKAWA Pro Roaster, which is now used every day by leading coffee professionals all over the world.  \nSome of the hundreds of prototypes we've created\nThe real challenge was to build a machine that could reproduce a roast accurately, regardless of the environment.\nIKAWA has unique patented roasting technology and uses top quality components. During the roast process a papery skin comes off the coffee \u2013 called chaff. Over time this would block a normal filter \u2013 so we included a cyclone that will never get blocked. Our roasting system is patented with support from James Dyson. \nIKAWA has built a strong team fuelled by constant supply of freshly roasted coffee who are super excited to be launching the Home Roaster.\nMore Technical Detail\nWe thought you might like to know a bit more depth about the design process, and how some of the key features work so made this short video.\n Below are some of the aspects of the roaster we're most proud of: \nThere is only one moving part in the whole roaster which is the fan. It is part of our patented roasting technology. The fan can reach a max speed of 22,500 RPM and achieves a number of critical features: \nFan delivers heat from heating element to the roast chamber where coffee roasting happens \nThe fan removes the chaff that\u2019s released during roasting and sends it to the collection jar. The chaff will never block the roaster and affect air pressure and does not need external venting. \nAfter the roast, the fan blows the roasted coffee beans from the roast chamber into the collection jar. (see above video)\nThe case is super strong. It will be made from extruded Aluminium 6060-T6 and is 3.5mm think. Internal parts or the roaster are thermally isolated from the roasting components which can reach 240 degrees Centigrade. This means the roaster is safe to touch, even after a long roast. \nThe roaster is able to very accurately follow the roast recipe \u2013 so if you program the same recipe, you will achieve the exact same results. This is due to accurate closed circuit temperature control and small quanity of coffee. We use a PT1000 (grade A) temperature sensor made from platinum which is ultra sensitive and stable. A PID Controller controls the amount of heat that the heating element produces using a PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) technique. So when you follow the app during a roast, you\u2019ll see how closely the actual temperature matches the roast recipe. \nThe Home Roaster is small and compact. It will not take over your kitchen and will not produce loads of smoke.\nThe Doser is on top of the roaster and is used to measure the perfect amount of coffee. Each roast takes 60g of green coffee which translates to around 50g of roasted coffee. It\u2019s super simple to use and made from investment cast stainless steel. (see above video)\nThe lid is attached using sanarium-cobalt magnets which eliminates the need for screwing and makes it easy to clean. The lid is made from toughened safety glass similar to an oven door, it's transparent so can see the coffee as it roasts. \n\nStrength, Safety and Durability  \nIt will take 8 months from a successful Kickstarter project to deliver the Home Roasters. A considerable amount of time will be spent on testing the machine to ensure it is safe and works perfectly. \nAll roasters are CE marked. Roasters sold to North America will also be UL Certified.  \nBelow are the 15 tests we undertake.\nRepeatable Roast Test  \nAir-flow programming test \nHot Electronics Test \n1200 roast cycle durability test \nExternal Safety Assessment \nSurface Temperature Test\nBlow-over test \nExtreme Roast test \nSingle Fault Analysis \nHeating Element Failure Test  \nFirmware / Software function test \nConsistent roast test \nPackaging drop-test \nBluetooth communication test \nElectromagnetic compatibility test\nStretch Goals\nWe're delighted to meet our goal and want to give something back through our stretch goals, without complicating the project delivery. \nRewards\nThrough this Kickstarter project we aim to raise enough money to pay for our first production run of the IKAWA Home Roasters. You can help us achieve this through backing our campaign.\nProject Scope and Timeline \nWe\u2019ve taken this idea a long way already; built a network of suppliers, and created an award winning professional roaster. We know what it takes to deliver projects successfully and have well developed plans in place for the Home Roaster we\u2019re launching on Kickstarter.\nBacking from Kickstarter will enable us to: \nFinalise the new Home Roaster design. We need create a new simplified design that is straight forward to assemble at scale with a lower cost price\nInvest in production tooling to reduce the manufacturing costs of the components. \nDevelop an Apple and Android App for the Home Roaster. \nThe Money we raise through Kickstarter will be spent on the following: \nBuying the stock to make the rewards. \nElectronic design work to re-package the electronics onto a single printed circuit board. \nPrototyping and testing to make sure the Home Roaster works perfectly every time. \nApp programming to develop the new Home Roaster App. \nTravel costs to see our suppliers and Engineering partners. \nUL and CE Certification Testing to ensure that the Home Roaster is completely safe to use.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIn order to make the Home Roaster more affordable than the Professional Roaster we are having to evolve our designs and produce the roasters in larger production runs. There is always some degree of uncertainty when creating any new product, but we have taken every precaution to avoid this causing disruption and have extremely advanced plans already. \n\nWe have the benefit of a strong network of manufacturing partners and the experience of several production runs of the Pro Roaster so have learnt a lot about the best ways to plan and produce IKAWA Roasters. Similarly, we have a global warehouse network set-up already which will help us to deliver the roasters to your door. \n\nWe have been realistic with our timings, allowing a reasonable amount of time for each step of the production process. \n\nPlease see Q&A section for any questions you may have, or if they\u2019re not covered, drop us a line through Kickstarter or to info@ikawacoffee.com and we\u2019ll be happy to help.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #31", "update_userinfo": "Shipping Update", "update_content": "First up, we\u2019re pleased to report that we\u2019ve been making steady progress dispatching Home Coffee Roasters and packs of coffee to Kickstarter backers, and it\u2019s been rewarding to hear your feedback.

The faster the fan is the more the roaster is in the realm of convective heat. The lower the fan speed the more the beans are being roasted in conductive heat.

I shot for 13% but am still hitting around 14-15%. Ending color and roast degree are two different things. Like two eyes trying to focus on the same image. They need to meet in the middle so the beans are roasted enough on the inside and look like the roasted from the outside. Outside and inside color need to match(usually) without internal scourging or a \"smoked brisket\" ring on the inside. After a roast take a bean or two and a sharp knife and cut through the bean on your cutting board, and look at the inside vs outside in a good light, use a sharp knife and be consistent with the light you use. Nothing is better than sunlight. For the nature of the air roaster and given that 2mins are allowed in the range of combustion, one can achieve virtually as dark as you like. No offense: if you are drinking your coffee with additives either the beans aren't good or your roast isn't. If you get an upset stomach or the taste is too strong (astringent) then your are roasting way too far killing off any flavors by turning them bitter or astringent or \"roasty/ashy are also notes of overdevelopment. Excluding health problems or you just like that.

Sorry for not responding, but I am in the middle of a large project at work .. so just work and a little bit of sleep with no time for anything else. So .... Not much roasting on my side lately. Regarding me not being able to enjoy dark roasts, its very much connected to that taste and smell that happens when you caramelize sugar and overdo and \"burn\" it a little bit. I am very sensitive to that and I do not like it at all ... and for me the start of this is way before you get anywhere near second crack. To me, this particular flavor obscures those floral and fruity and other light notes .. It might be quite different in blends, but I do not do blends, as I want to see the bean very cleanly and sharply how it is. I do not mind the gaps in the taste profiles, or high spikes at some places ... I enjoy it because of those differences. So that is very different from making a rich and ballanced blends where you most probably will try to have it all sort of covered and filled as a smooth hill of tastes. I am quite crazy about doing the exact opposite - using high quality grinders and precise sieves to make as straight and sharply defined extraction as I can - to have all those spikes and valleys sharply defined. :D", "time": "almost 4 years ago"}, {"username": "Deven", "content": "Maybe IKAWA can chime in and say what the differences are.

However, I believe because the ROR was too steep it was vastly thin in body with no chocolate or a \"Sumatra\" flavor after resting and pulled as an espresso and V60, throughout a week. I am sure the right profile is there but it will take some time for me to find it. My theory really revolves around that sustaining a constant high temp will \"evaporate\" the flavor away.

Today we tried my 5 different test roasts of Ethiopia Guji sundried natural, with a friend that is a skilled barista and professional roaster. I will post pictures and profiles and all a bit later for @Christo and all others .. but for now I can say this - the best roast of all was the one I based from one of the Ikawa Ethiopian profiles ... and the first one I stopped just by looking at the beans and smelling what comes out of the exhaust. It had crack starting at cca 4minutes and I ended the roast at 7 minutes, 1 and someting minutes after the crack ended. I made another one minute longer roast, and some other profiles that I wanted to see what effect they would have, all stopping by feel and look. All the other roasts were also good but though somehow not having the same great ballance in the cup. And even the worst one that did not crack audibly though I waited to 9th minute was quite drinkable, though not any close to best one. AND ... there is more. He said about the best roast, that he does not remember he had any coffee while at Budapest WOC that was as good as this one (which I can confirm too, because it was sooo aromatic and fruity and all ... really amazing coffee). Which means at least one thing - that Ikawa Home with really great quality beans, can produce a taste profile that can compete with professionally roasted SO coffee. I dont say a professional with professional equipment would not make it better (but I think it would not be and order of magnitude better, just a bit better ...because it was really great espresso), but - the tool we have now is not a toy, its a really good tool :D and that is what I expected but yet am delighted to be able to confirm.

I am definitely not looking for a definitive guide from Ikawa or anyone else. Coffee is a very complex subject, from growing the beans, treatment of the beans, roasting to grinding and brewing. There is no fixed rule for anything and so many variables. My point was absolutely NOT about getting detailed guidelines or instruction before experimentation. After all as I told you, I am already experimenting anyway. And it is not about wasting 50g of beans if some experiment goes wrong either. It is simply that, it would help us to understand how different parameters may affect the final roasting result if we have a basic guide. No one can tell you exactly how to alter a roasting profile to achieve a certain definitive result, but at least they can point you in the right direction. Of course you can always learn to do anything yourself without any help from anyone, just do a lot of experimentation and fail many times to learn. I have nothing against that at all. If you are a pioneer in something. Say you are the first surgeon in the world, you probably would have cut up many dead bodies to learn about anatomy and then probably perform surgery on 100 patients before you save the first one. But we are not in stone age anymore, and doctors are taught by experience teachers on surgery, so they don't need to blindly do experiment anymore.

All the rest should be covered: highly repeatable roast profile due to PID, less noisy, great cooling and chaff collection, ability to do lots of experimenting without wasting time or coffee (small batch size), clean, low smoke, good roast uniformity.

So my question is: will a roast profile that is optimized for a particular variety or blend on your roaster translate to a prosumer (or small pro) drum roaster and achieve the same (or very similar) result in the cup? Although I can understand how a temp profile should translate (as long as both machines are PID controlled) I don't understand how fan speed would translate. It would be pretty exciting if roast profiles did translate (read: if you helped make sure they translated) because I think it would help you sell a lot more roasters to coffee geeks.

When I look at the roaster in all it's roasting glory what it says to me is that the cord \"should\" be coming out of the back of the machine opposite the glass bean container.

Regardless, IF it were possible to reposition the cord to come out the back, I would vote for that!", "time": "about 6 years ago"}, {"username": "Jerry", "content": "Thanks!", "time": "about 6 years ago"}, {"username": "Pavel Dru\u017eba", "content": "@Jerry @Ronnie - looking a bit more, it seems that switch is sort of magick :) its there but its not.

For me it is a better feeling than some modern touch and hold or so. So from my point of view having a physical toggle switch is fine, as long and it is feeling solid, metal, as long as its a good feeling to turn it on ( :) ) .

These men and women go into battle better prepared than any generation before them, with equipment allowing them to go further into fires and survive impossible conditions.  However, the technological leaps in the fire industry used to fight fires have left behind the most basic operations of any fire attack: Accountability and Communication.  Outdated ID tag systems exist across the country today to account for firefighters' locations while on-scene.  70% of fire departments we've surveyed stated that the tag systems are unreliable and problematic.  PROBEE Safety was created to address the need to bring firefighter accountability into the age of big data and big solutions.  More importantly, our goal is to do this in a simple, accessible, and affordable manner that does not interfere with the working firefighter.\nAdditionally, once a firefighter enters a structure, the sole means of communication with operations outside is with a portable radio, and due to the cost of these, many firefighters have to do without. This means that incident command has a limited exterior perspective of the fire scene. This also forces command to rely heavily on their tag system and communication with a firefighter who is likely unaware of their actual position within a structure.\nOur field-tested prototype assists First Responders with situational awareness, risk management, and most importantly, firefighter safety.  Our system blends rugged hardware with advanced software to deliver a functional product that we hope will become standard equipment for every firefighter.\nHow does our system work?\nWhen a firefighter arrives on a fire scene, they go about their normal operations of fire suppression while being monitored by our POLO radio beacon. This device powers itself on and begins monitoring the firefighter for movement, their air supply, and live fire conditions around them. Upon recognizing a life-threatening situation, the POLO transmits an emergency broadcast out of the structure to one of four MARCO routers, which calculate the firefighter's location to within a quadrant and floor level.\nThis is how MARCOs are deployed around a building\nI am sure you're wondering how these MARCO devices got into position, right? Well, this is the piece that requires a user interaction: placing one MARCO on each side of the structure based on the device\u2019s alphabetic designation (A, B, C, or D), which corresponds to the fire industry\u2019s best practices. The MARCOs can be placed at any time during the fire attack, to ensure that the fire operation is not interrupted.  In most cases, these can be placed during the initial walk around of the structure.\nMARCO routers deployed on the A side of the fire structure\nTo close the loop from data to rescue, in the event of an alarm, a fire officer equipped with a tablet will be made aware of the developing situation by an alert on the PROBEE application. When not being used, the application runs passively in the background and maintains communication with the deployed MARCOs and POLOs, available for use as needed.  Let's face it, our fire officers have other things to worry about, but when they really need that crucial information, the PROBEE Safety system will be within reach to facilitate a rescue.\nCurrent State of Product Development & Limitations\nOur team designs and manufactures communication tools for use in rugged environments.  Our system is designed for wood and masonry residential structures, which account for a majority of the structures in the United States.  Between 2001 and 2010, 57% of firefighter deaths and 80% of firefighter injuries occurred in single or twin family structures.  We intentionally avoided the high-rise and commercial structure market because we felt that a simple, cost effective solution could be developed to address a significant portion of the market, as 80% of structural fires in the US are in residential structures.  Our research indicates that the PROBEE Safety system provides the most accurate elevation information in the industry.\nPROBEE has been deployed in three live burn tests at a local fire academy to verify functionality in an Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health (IDLH) environment.  These tests have provided valuable information to our team at a prototype stage, namely system functionality at temperature, data transmission capability, elevation algorithm adequacy, and ease of use.  We\u2019ve also deployed our system multiple times in non-burning structures to check our quadrant algorithms and horizontal location functionality, and have been pleased with the results.\nPROBEEs innovative elevation detection technique\nWe\u2019ve been able to achieve everything we\u2019ve set out to do thus far using commercially available off-the-shelf components and injection molded/3D printed cases, greatly reducing development costs and issues.  We\u2019ve reached a point where further development will require formal testing to show that our system meets the relevant NFPA consensus standards, an important seal of approval needed for acceptance in the industry.\nHow will we use the Kickstarter funds?\nWe need your help to get us through the testing recommended for all equipment worn by emergency responders today.  This includes burning, drowning, dropping, dusting, and exploding our poor system to find its weak spots.  We also need to take our development-friendly software and package it into a nice tablet GUI before the product is ready to hit the fire station.\nWe are at a point where we will be procuring molds, downsizing the power supply, and conducting formal bench and field testing for our product certifications.  Our minimum quantity for production runs is about 20 units (one system), so we can focus on quality rather than worrying about funding for a large minimum order.\nTo get this fully deployed, our budgeted need is approximately $30,000, which will provide us with enough funding to go through the remaining development steps to get us to the first production run.\nWith your help we can provide firefighters with the information necessary to detect dangerous situations and facilitate proactive responses.\nOur timeline for the coming months\nREWARDS!!!\nThe Limited Edition PROBEE Safety Supporter T-shirt!\nAll womens' sizes available in Sunset Orange or Navy and Mens' in Kiwi Green or Navy\nThe PROBEE Safety Chamois Cloth, what more can be said?\n\nYOUR help will make PROBEE possible!\n Any pledge amount brings us one step closer to our goal of improving fire scene communication and accountability.

THANK YOU for your help!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOne of the hardest parts of deploying equipment in the fire industry is offering a useful product at a great value. What has given us the upper hand is a deep understanding of firefighting techniques, and the engineering expertise to put a product together at an affordable price. PROBEE was born from the fire industry and has a strong base of enthusiastic supporters eagerly awaiting the word that our system is ready to be deployed in their station.\n\nOur functioning Polo units need some minor refinement to facilitate mass production and interoperability with existing industry equipment.\n\nOur team of engineers and firefighters, in coordination with our local ISO 9001:2008 contract manufacturer, have experience successfully delivering projects. Products regularly in use within the fire industry have successfully passed the same tests we are faced with. We're confident that the development, testing, and manufacturing challenges that we will likely face can be overcome by pulling from our collective experiences and applying a bit of ingenuity to solve the issues as they arise.\n\nNo one wants to see a great product executed poorly. We have worked extremely hard to ready the PROBEE Safety system for Kickstarter, product testing, and fulfillment, but here are what we see as the risks:\n\nMANUFACTURING: Creating the tooling to manufacture a product of this level of intricate detail is expensive and requires expert knowledge to get it right. There is typically a 6-week lead time to create the tooling for a product of this complexity and this is where delays could occur. To minimize that possibility, we're working with tooling manufacturing partners with a track record for prompt quality.\n\nPRODUCT ADJUSTMENTS: As the PROBEE Safety system gets geared up for production, there will likely be some minor adjustments to improve the final product. Pre-production prototypes are made to test and refine the product and allow us to incorporate our adjustments and those suggested by experienced manufacturing partners, along with making any changes required for compliance certifications (such as UL 913 requirements). Changes will always be made for the benefit of our firefighters, and we will let you know exactly how and why any are made.\n\nFULFILLMENT: Sometimes things go awry that simply can't be planned for: a supplier misses a deadline, a machine breaks down, or a shipment gets lost. Those things could cause a delay. To minimize the possibility of delays, we've built our manufacturing team and coordinated our production and fulfillment schedules.\n\nTHE FINE PRINT (PLEASE READ THIS!)\n\n-- Our system is a tool and not a life saving device. The system provides information and what users do with that information is up to them. Common sense, experience, and good judgment should be used when relying on the information provided by our system during the decision making process. Tools don't save people; firefighters do.\n\n-- Our system is designed to supplement, not replace, existing PPE, PASS devices, radios, and tools currently used in the fire industry during a response.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "PROBEE Safety\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nPROBEE Safety was started as a Senior Design project at Drexel University in Philadelphia, PA.

Although the circuit is made in China, the special fabric of the expandable bladder which is the light disfusing element, is made in Connecticut. \nIt is specifically engineered to withstand extreme outdoor environments. This product is revolutionizing the way we light our world. It is a formidable champion of beautiful, mobile, modern, and sustainable lighting, simply using the limitless renewable awesomeness of our sun.\nAWARDS + PRESS\nA Little History\nBackground\nThis light was first developed by Alice Min Soo Chun for emergency relief after the Haiti earthquake. In 2010, while teaching at Columbia University, Alice returned from Haiti and converted her architecture lab into an innovation center for disaster relief. Alice shared her years of research on integrating thin film substrates with photo voltaics and the idea of an inflatable solar light with the goal of creating sustainable solutions for disaster relief. The first prototype for the SolarPuff, along with all other inflatable solar lanterns currently on the market, were born in her lab.  Alice holds four patents for the inflatable solar lantern and solar light assembly.\nWhere we are Today \nIt took quite a few prototypes to find the right fabric, best components and the unparalleled design.  We wanted to make sure the fabric was non-toxic (PVC free) to the environment and full recyclable. We finally produced the perfect combination this past summer (2014). \nIn September 2014, we signed a licensing agreement with a distributor in Japan who received their first order for SolarPuffs in December 2014. All have sold and they are awaiting their next shipment.\nIn March 2015, we signed a distribution agreement with a Caribbean distributor and we are currently speaking with other distributors in India, Belgium, UK, Korea, Thailand, Tunisia, Nairobi, Singapore and Hong Kong for starters.\nWho \"WANTS\" A SolarPuff?\nThis superior solar inflatable light is great for the home, gardens, pools, boating enthusiasts, camping, hiking, corporate premiums and military applications. It is also the most ideal lantern for emergency and disaster relief, due to its light weight and it's the most hygienic since there is no need to use your mouth to inflate.The light weight design makes for lower shipping costs and its foldability allows for dense packing of 80+ units per box. The high tech fabric creates a delightful dispersion of light. Every household on the earth would benefit from owning a SolarPuff. It's the perfect gift for everyone.\nWho \"NEEDS\" A SolarPuff?\nThe IFC (International Finance Corporation) estimates that globally, over 1.6 billion people \u2013 possibly as high as 3 billion \u2013 are living without access to reliable electricity. \n According to figures from the International Energy Agency, at least 20% of the planet's inhabitants are still without the simple luxury of a light switch.\nSo how do they light their homes and cook their food? They are using kerosene, wood, crop waste, charcoal, coal and dung. Worldwide, over 500 million households use kerosene, for lighting.\nAccording to studies conducted by Dr. Evan Mills, founder of the Lumina Project, an initiative that promotes low-carbon alternatives to fuel-based lighting, \"kerosene (or as he refers to it, \"dirty lighting\") consumes 77 billion liters of fuel worldwide, costing its predominantly impoverished end-users a total of $36 billion annually.\"Kerosene costs 25 to 30 percent of a family\u2019s income \u2014 globally. The poor do not use kerosene because it is cheap \u2014 they are kept poor in significant part because they must rely on expensive, dirty kerosene. .\nWhat We Want to Do  \nWith your help, we can revolutionize how people are lighting their homes. We want people to be prepared with a SolarPuff in their home for when the next Hurricane Katrina or Sandy hits and we want to provide clean sustainable lighting to those that need it most. \nCalculated from research, if everyone in the United States used a SolarPuff for one hour a day instead of a regular light bulb, it would save over 11 BILLION tons of CO2 emissions from going into the air each year!! \nIn the United States 75% of the air pollution in urban areas is due to energy consumption from buildings. Solight Design wants to design and manufacture beautifully architected solar solutions that people will want in their homes and, at the same time, help eradicate pollution, poverty and excessive energy consumption!  \nWe don't want to stop there! We want to change the reliance on dirty fuels to light the homes of people living off the grid. Globally there are at least 1.6 billion people without reliable access to electricity. This lack of access to efficient energy becomes even more apparent in rural areas of developing countries where most lighting is fueled by kerosene, which is not only toxic but extremely expensive, creating a vicious cycle of poverty.\nThe HELIX vs PUFF:\nMany of our supporters have been asking how the Helix and Puff are different. Well the Helix is a Twist and a little more compact than the SolarPuff. It is made from recyclable TPU, a thermoplastic that has a unique memory for shape retention. you can see in the video here that a slight push will start the deflation process in motion and it will remember to flat pack back to a square. Also the light is more uniform than the SolarPuff since the SolarPuff has more a a spectrum of light. The SolarPuff has a ziplock pouch for packaging and the Helix has a paper packaging. The SolarPuff  light diffuser is made from a Sail Cloth Fabric that is made in the USA and the Helix light diffuser material (TPU)is made in China. Hope this helps!\nPLAY\n\nHelix\nHelix\nSolarPuff packs into a Polygon\nSolarPuff\nWho Are We?\nAlice Min Soo Chun and Stacy Kelly, Co-Founders\nAlice Min Soo Chun is a Co-Founder and CEO of Solight Design and the inventor of the Solar Inflatable Light: SolarPuff.

Whereas the SolarPuff, has a spectrum of light dispersion and is prism-like as the light transfers through the high tech fabric material. \nFolding technology - Both use origami principles yet the Helix is a twist fold and pack motion. The SolarPuff has a pinch and fold motion. \nCosts  - TPU is less expensive and allows us to produce a economical version of the SolarPuff.\nIn all other components and functions, they are the same. They both float as the solar circuit is completely protected in a vacuumed sealed bladder. They both recycle. They charge the same and have the same lumenosity. They have equal lighting and will last just as long. And, finally, both have three settings, low, high and flash.\nCheck out the video at the top of the page to see how we demo the SoalrPuff vs the Helix,\nPledge $5 or more \nThank you\nYou get a \"Thank You\" note and our immense gratitude!!

And they would have been SO PERFECT for the trip, too. Charity should be voluntary, you shouldn't be forced to do it. You told us about the 4000 you already had in stock and you promised it to us as soon as the project ended. The way I see it, as soon as the project ended, we Kickstarter backers owned those units you had in stock, you were just holding them for us until you could ship them. Now, you have decided to donate OUR units, and COMPLETELY go back on your delivery promises without even asking us how we felt about it. So, we are being forced to donate our units to charities (in exchange for later deliveries) instead of giving us the option to do it willingly (and from the comments, A LOT of people would have done it willingly). The LEAST you could have done is have a poll to see if your backers would agree to do this before you just decided to do it on your own. I'm sure it's true that the people in Nepal need it now more than any of us, but that will still be true months from now when the next shipments come in. So if we are going to make sure that the needy get it first before the backers, we will NEVER get our pledges because there will ALWAYS be someone more needy (Nepal, the orphanage, the next natural disaster, etc.).

She is ingenious, generous and humble as a practitioner and as an educator. Unfortunately, in our culture, kindness and humility may be mistaken for weakness and preyed upon. I also know Andrea Sureshta and Anna Stork as they were students in a first year design studio that I taught at the Graduate School of Architecture at Columbia, and, I sat on the review of the Haiti studio when they presented large scale umbrella lights before Alice shifted the scale of the studio projects to smaller realizable designs. I am very disappointed in the way success has been sought at the expense of others and at the vindictiveness of Anna's campaign against Alice Chun. Andrea and Anna fit the model of the start-up and the focus on youth and ingenuity in design fields and the culture at large. Alice has been reluctant to tell her story as a single mother, as inventor, as designer at multiple scales, as an educator... Unfortunately, in the United States, the general populace seems to believe the \"those who can't teach\" ethos. As someone with a successful practice sustained simultaneously while a dedicated educator, I write to refute this. Architecture design problems require craft and uniquely reflect their creators. A well-crafted problem or program contains inherent possible solutions. Without the well-crafted problem and the nurturing of the instructor the design project as such would not be conceived. For a student to claim sole authorship of a design work in the contemporary design studio is not accurate in most cases. Further, instructors run the risk of having their ideas co-opted without credit should they share their work too freely. The situation in design studios is more complex and cooperative than is admitted. I am so happy to see Alice clarified the facts regarding her relationship as a patent holder of LuminAid and posted the patents. As a self-inflating structure, \"SolarPuff & SolarHelix are a unique little lights\" that were designed with a mission to help those in need and they are also beautiful well made objects.

The amount of light seems similar to what I get from my high-end Koncept LED lamp; the Koncept lamp is rated for 14,000 hours of use and costs around $150-300 plus shipping. The Solarpuff is much cheaper, doesn't use electricity, and has a cool design (though in a different way from the Koncept); I understand Solarpuff has only a one-year warranty.

We believe greener living is better living, and we think everyone should be growing herbs, crops, and beautiful plants everywhere. That's why we started Pikaplant, and that's why we created Tableau.\nAre you away from home a lot for work and travels? Are you forgetful when it comes to watering your plants? Do you know anyone who is? Tableau is an automatic house plant watering tray. It waters your plants so you don't have to.\nIt's hard to keep house plants healthy and happy. Over-watering and under-watering are two of the biggest problems faced by aspiring home gardeners. That's because most plants like to be watered in a steady rhythm. \nWhen we designed Tableau's irrigation system, we looked to an obvious source for inspiration, nature. In nature a plant gets its water in a wet-dry cycle. The wet allows roots to absorb water. The dry lets them air out and breathe. This is good for a plant's roots, making it grow strong and healthy. \nTableau mimics this natural cycle to automatically water your plants. Tableau makes growing leafy greens, bright florals, and tasty herbs super easy. Grow plants for food. Grow plants that clean the air. Grow plants for fun. They'll brighten up any room.\nDesigned in the Netherlands, its simple minimalist aesthetic brings out the best in your plants. We've used basic materials like glass, steel, and ceramics because we believe in making quality products. Tableau's sleek design brings a simple tranquility into your home or work space.      \nWatering your plants with Tableau is easy. Just make sure there's water in the reservoir and Tableau does the rest. The reservoir is easy to lift off of the base for refilling, so you can place your plants away from a water source. By watering your plants from below, your plants decide how much to drink. The reservoir contains enough to water three plants for around a month.  \nOur unique ebb-and-flow technology mimics one of the key water cycles found in nature: ground water. Rather than slow-releasing water from the reservoir, Tableau provides water in a wet-dry cycle for strong roots and healthy plants. Once your plants have absorbed all of the water in the base, it stays dry for a few days before refilling with water.    \nStaying true to nature, we've designed Tableau to work using zero electricity. The bi-valve system that controls the water flow from the reservoir to the base is sensitive to humidity and pressure. Zero electricity also means zero wires, meaning you can place your plants and Tableau wherever you want. \nScientific studies have shown that a plant-rich environment boosts creativity and productivity. Plants reduce stress and clean the air. Use Tableau in your kitchen, living room, or work space. Grow crops, grow herbs, grow beautiful plants. It's easy. \nJoost is a lifelong inventor and tech head. He built a gaming console at age six using parts salvaged from a tape deck and a dot matrix printer. He makes Tableau work and he\u2019s the caring owner of a multitude of healthy house plants.\nDanny comes from a horticultural background. His great aunt and uncle have run an award winning orchid nursery in Java for over 60 years. After a recent visit he imported 100 orchid seedlings to the Netherlands, only to see them all die within a year.\nNynke is the ultimate multi-tasker. She represents the larger team dedicated to making Tableau a reality: the Pikapeeps. Every day she reaches out to others and shares our story because she knows this unique product needs to get made.\nMake sure the reservoir contains water and Tableau will automatically water your plants. It\u2019s easy to lift the reservoir off of the base, so you can fill it at any watering station. Then simply place it on the base to connect. Water will flow down into the base. The top of the base is covered in a capillary fabric that acts as a wick. The bottoms of the pots have holes through which the soil makes contact with the fabric, so your house plants can drink. After they\u2019ve finished the water, the base stays dry for a few days before fresh water flows down from the reservoir and the cycle continues.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProduct Development\nThe Tableau design is finished, but there are some technical details to tweak. We always do this in collaboration with production partners and suppliers. We've kept the design of Tableau as simple as possible, and we're speaking with multiple production partners. With a product of this complexity this phase shouldn't take more than a month. \n\nProduction\nWe've spoken to our production partners and production between August and November is both feasible and realistic. From our previous experience in designing and product managing new consumer products, we're confident we'll get Tableau produced in these numbers within three months. We've planned with contingencies but there is always a chance that multiple unexpected setbacks will stack. By keeping channels open with multiple partners, we're keeping this risk to a minimum.\n\nDistribution\nWe've been warned that this might become a significant challenge. Tableau works using zero electricity, so getting certifications and clearing import regulations shouldn't pose any extra problems. At any rate EU pledgers, you're all clear. We're also in touch with distributors in the US, Australia, and Asia. If you're pledging from outside these regions, we'd like to invite you to help us make sure we hit our delivery dates.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #28", "update_userinfo": "Survey Feedback Update", "update_content": "Hi everyone,\nFirst things first: thank you to everyone who provided feedback through the survey, we\u2019re grateful you took the time to provide your input!

With FLYTE, we've set the lightbulb free.\n                                                                                         The world moves so fast, so take a break from gravity and experience something surreal that appears suspended in time. FLYTE requires no batteries and powers light through the air via induction. \n \nMAKER KIT: Create your own levitating thingy. The FLYTE Maker Kit includes a base and a magnet with 4 ultra bright LEDs powered wirelessly via induction. Share it with your friends, or combine them to make multiple levitating light sculptures. Light will rotate slowly around the room. We can't wait to see what you'll come up with.\nDesigned in Sweden, the FLYTE base is made of sustainable sourced oak, ash and walnut. We want your FLYTE to look good, feel good and last a long time. We use energy efficient LEDs rated at about 50,000 hours. That's 12 hours a day for 11 years! \nNikola Tesla's Wireless Power System\nWireless power transfer transmission has been around since the days of Nikola Tesla. With FLYTE we've packed some of Tesla's tech and combined it with magnetic levitation, opening up a magical world of possibilities. Our wireless power module transmits about 5V and is completely safe and harmless. Edison and Tesla can finally be friends.\n Power is transferred wirelessly from the base to the bulb.\n\nHow do I levitate FLYTE?\nGently lower the bulb over the center of the magnetic base. The LEDs will start to light up and you will start to feel an upward resistance. When the bulb is positioned exactly at the center of the base, you will feel a gentle release. The electro-magnets will automatically center the bulb in position. Slowly let go of the bulb and it willl lock in position, light up and rotate slowly. \n\nFLYTE custom series features a handmade diamond-cut wooden base. Each unit is unique and numbered, and is made in Sweden from elm wood. Get your limited edition piece crafted from designer and woodworker Dan Henriksson.\nTurning on & off your FLYTE is as simple as touching the surface of the base. Light will turn on & off while the levitation will remain intact.\nOur capactive touch sensor is where the magic happens. Our FLYTE switch feels effortless and smooth, just like touching wood.\nCharge your smartphone...through the air.\nPlace your phone over the base and the built-in induction coil will transform your FLYTE into a wireless charging base station.*\n\n *Requires third parties accessory.\n\n FLYTE is the result of years of research using magnetic levitation and induction technologies.  Here are just some of the designs and iterations leading up to FLYTE.\nWe have secured our relations with our manufactures and ready to start the production process but in order to make this a reality, we need your help. We have moved out of the prototyping phase and are now ready to bring FLYTE to you.

If you missed our campaign, you can still get your SnapPower Chargers at www.snappower.com\nSnapPower Charger Overview\nPowerful 1-amp USB charger built into an outlet cover plate.\nCharges any USB device (phones, phablets, tablets, hotspots, etc.) and eliminates the need for bulky wall warts. \nInstalls in seconds over any standard outlet in your home. \nThere\u2019s no wiring to mess with, and no batteries to sort out. Just bring a screwdriver and a good attitude. \nFor renters, this solution provides convenient wall charging that can be taken with you when you move.  If you move out, just pop the old cover back on.\nMake any standard outlet in your home USB compatible...in seconds\n* Not compatible with GFCI outlets\n Installation is drop-dead simple. For real. Seriously.\n Wiring is a buzzkill. The SnapPower Charger installs in literally seconds, and requires no wiring whatsoever. Here\u2019s the play-by-play:\nSimplicity makes all the difference\nPLAY\n\nTake back your outlets!\nEven when charging your devices, both outlets remain open and available for other uses at all times.\nDesign\nWith custom-built components engineered to fit entirely inside the cover plate, it's the sleekest, most low profile charger around.\nIts slim design allows furniture to be positioned snug against the wall. The side access to the charging port enables you to plug your USB cables in with no hassle.\nNo more searching for lost adapters\nUnlike plug-in adapters that get shuffled around from room to room (and eventually lost), the SnapPower Charger is securely screwed to the outlet and always there when you need it.\n Charges any device from any manufacturer\nBlends in with any home decor\nHow it works (or, the science behind the magic)\nWhat type of outlets can be used with the SnapPower Charger?\nThe SnapPower Charger comes in a variety of styles and colors. The Chargers are compatible with standard duplex and decor outlets that have exposed screw terminals, regardless of the manufacturer or year. The SnapPower charger is not compatible with Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) outlets that are sometimes found in bathrooms. GFCI outlets do not have the required screw terminals and can be identified by the \u201ctest\u201d and \u201creset\u201d buttons located on the face of the outlet.\nCompatible Outlets:\nIf you\u2019re picking up what we\u2019re putting down, help us by sharing SnapPower with your friends and family!\nFor the Press\nIf you're looking for hi-res pictures, you've come to the right spot! Just click HERE.  If you need to get in contact, feel free to email us at kickstarter@snappower.com.  \n\nRewards\nTimeline\nCan you install the SnapPower Charger upside down (with the USB port above the outlet)?  \nThe SnapPower Charger is designed to work in only one orientation. The USB port is designed to be installed on the same side as the ground prongs on the outlet. For example: If the ground prongs on the outlet are facing down, the Charger will need to be installed with the USB port beneath the outlet.  If the ground prongs on the outlet are facing up, then the Charger will need to be installed with the USB port above the outlet (pictured below).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nForecast Risk\nWe've spent a lot of time engineering a product that meets the highest standards of performance, durability and convenience.

It's been an amazing 45 days and we're looking forward to getting production started.\nTo order some SilverAir Socks & Shirts, head on over to yathletics.com\nWhy you'll love the SilverAir Sock:\nOur Story\nY Athletics was born on Kickstarter with the help and support of thousands of backers from over 70 countries. Our mission is to design and manufacture the highest quality products in each activewear category, using the best materials and technologies on the market. Simply put, we create products that are engineered for performance and insanely comfortable\u2014you\u2019ll never want to take them off.\nWe leverage cutting edge technologies like seamless knitting, which eliminates the need for stitches and ensures minimal irritation. Our fabrics are sourced from unique locations around the world, wherever innovation is occurring most rapidly. This includes yarns knitted with pure silver, which prevents odor from accumulating on your gear.\nA year ago, we launched our first product - the SilverAir Shirt - and our fans helped us raise more than $250,000 to kickstart our dream. We\u2019re frequently asked what\u2019s next and now have an answer: \nAfter many months and hundreds of hours in development, we got the formula right and our next product is ready. We are proud to introduce the SilverAir Sock - It's beautiful. It's comfortable. It's odorless. It just works.\n\nDevelopment\nThis is a brand new fabric. We sourced the finest merino wool from Australia, known for its natural performance and odor-resistant qualities. But wool by itself is not soft enough, so we added acrylic for superior comfort, nylon for durability, and spandex for stretch recoverability. Finally, we blended pure silver on the areas that accumulate the most sweat, which takes the odor-fighting capability of this sock to a whole new level, unlike anything you\u2019ve experienced.\nAfter fabrication comes construction and we iterated until it was just right. We used seamless knitting to create a sock without any stitches and added vent panels that allow airflow to keep your feet cool and comfortable. The sock is beautiful inside and out. After you've worn it a few times, you won\u2019t be able to go back to anything else.\nTesting\nWe've been testing our socks rigorously over the last 9 months. A backer from our first campaign cycled 800 miles for two weeks wearing the same pair of SilverAir socks. A decathlon athlete wore them through his entire race and the socks stayed fresh. And, of course, we wear them every day ourselves. Every test led to improvement until we got them just right. \nProduction\nThis is where you come in. We're still a young brand that's self-funded, and to bring these socks to market, we need to manufacture them at a moderate scale. Help us fund our first production batch of the SilverAir Sock and be the first to receive a pair... your support would mean the world to us.\n\nHow It Works\nWhere It's Made\nWe're proud to work with the best manufacturers in the industry. Here's where our socks and our shirts are made:\n\nSOCKS:\nSHIRTS:\nColors & Styles\nSOCKS:\nThanks to you, we will now be offering our socks in six colors. Check them out: \nThe Jet Black and Electric Blue are exact colors. The other 4 colors were unlocked as stretch goals and the colors shown are mock-ups. We'll show the actual socks in a future update.\n\nSHIRTS:\nFor this campaign, our shirts will be available in the short sleeve crew and V neck styles in six colors - Carbon Black, Jet Grey, Surf Blue, Alpine White, Alloro Green and Marino Blue.\nMeasurement Guide\nSOCKS: Our socks are unisex and will come in two sizes*:\n*Due to a small number of our backers having a shoe size of 14 and above, we are going to be producing an XL size for shoe sizes 14-16. This size will only be available in our most popular color - Jet Black.\n\nSHIRTS: Our shirt sizes are men-only for the time being. The shirts are fitted. We recommend sizing up if you prefer a loose fit.\n*Carbon Black color may not available in the XXL size\n**Please check our web-store for the latest measurements\nShipping / Delivery Schedule\nKickstarter backers will be receiving their shirts and their socks together. We estimate the following timeline:\nMAY 2015 - Campaign closes. Backers' selections finalized.\nJUNE 2015 - Raw materials are sourced and shipped to our factory.\nJULY 2015 - Production period.\nAUGUST 2015 - Finished products are shipped to our distribution center and on to your doorstep.\nWhere We Are\nSOCKS - We've been working with our sock manufacturer for almost a year now. We've made and tested dozens of prototypes and feel confident in bringing them to you. The socks you see in pictures are production-ready and we'll start manufacturing them as soon as we are able to raise the funds for production.\n\nSHIRTS - We have delivered thousands of shirts to the backers from our first Kickstarter campaign and continue to deliver shirts to customers every day. The production of our next batch of shirts will start soon and we want you to be the first to get your hands on them, at a deal exclusive to this Kickstarter campaign.\n\nHelp Us Spread The Word\nWe need your help to get the word out, so please help us by telling your friends and family about us. We also give away prototypes to our fans on facebook and twitter from time to time so keep an eye out...\nInternational Backers\nCarrier - We ship to most international countries via FedEx, to ensure the package is delivered to you safely in the shortest amount of time. If you would like to opt-in for another shipping method, please email us at hello@yathletics.com\nDuties & Taxes - Please be aware that all international shipments are subject to duties and taxes by your government and you are responsible for paying that. All Kickstarter rewards will be declared 'gift', however, most countries will still assess a value and in certain cases FedEx will pre-pay the duties and taxes and bill you later. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our second Kickstarter project and we have done our best to make realistic projections of the amount of raw materials we need, the time we need to receive them, and the time we need to manufacture the socks. However, manufacturing at the standards of Y Athletics has its own complications. Every single detail is scrutinized and we don't settle for anything less than perfection. The risk with that is that it if unavoidable production issues come up, the delivery of your rewards will be delayed.\n\nWith that said, we will make two promises:\n\n1. We will deliver the highest quality product to each and every single backer. We take extreme pride in making some of the best products in the world and will never compromise on quality.\n\n2.

We got a ton of great feedback and we're using it to develop even more awesome projects and kits.\nYou can join the conversation and check on our progress on our Facebook page or our website at pocketuniverses.com.\nWe set our goal based on the amount that we needed to develop and produce a first run of the circuit boards for these kits. We're going to use your feedback to regroup and see what we can do to make these cubes even better! Stay tuned because we've got a lot more yet to come!\nBuild a portal to your own world\nWhat if you found a cube that is larger on the inside than the outside? What if you could create a portal to another universe and breathe life into it with beautiful, custom animations? \nPocket Universes are worlds that you create. You can build a forest and control the weather, create a galaxy and control the starlight, or make glowing scenes of crystals and planets. We want to give you the tools to create fascinating scenes that grow and evolve over time.\nHow to create an infinite space\nAssuming you don't want to go through the hassle of breaking the laws of physics, how can you create an infinite space? We use high-quality two-way mirrored acrylic to create the optical illusion of a space that goes on forever. The two-way mirrors reflect about 70% of the light that hits them; the rest passes through to the outside. The reflections bounce around inside the cube and create the illusion of infinite space.\nBreathing life into your Universe\nOur open-source LED animations allow you to design your own beautiful spaces inside your cube. They can pulse with energy, crackle with lighting, simulate the weather at home, and much, much more! The kits are Arduino-compatible, so you can even write new code to create totally unique and inspiring scenes.\nWe have created four kits to get you started on your journey of world-building. \nThe Key and The Portal\nThe Key - A small 2in cube made from two-way mirrors\nThe Key is a small 2x2x2 inch cube and features a battery-powered LED that slowly cycles through the rainbow, illuminating the cube with vibrant color. It comes with a triangular base and your choice of one insert to add to the cube.\nThe Portal - a 4in cube with a programmable LED. The Key is shown on the left for comparison.\nThe Portal is a medium cube that measures 4x4x4 inches and includes a USB-powered LED that can run custom programming. The larger cube appears \"deeper\" because there is a larger space in each reflection.\nIt can pulse and glow, slowly change through custom color combinations, and much more! The board is Arduino-compatible. You can modify the open source code to take the animations in whatever direction you like! This cube also comes with a triangular base and your choice of insert.\nEach cube comes with an insert of your choice to diffuse the LEDs and distribute patterns into the cube\nThere are six inserts to choose from for these cubes\nThe Forest and The Starlight\nWe're offering these kits so that you can build whatever universe you want!\nThe 6in Forest Kit includes the basic components to build a miniature world: trees, clouds, LED diffuser, and an additional mirrored top and bottom. LEDs mounted in the top can simulate the sky, or flip the cube over and light your scene from below. The kit also includes acrylic to diffuse the light, creating a more natural look.\nThese kits come with everything you need to get started. We built the circuit boards and the grid separately in our prototypes, but part of the funds for this campaign will go toward rolling them together into one custom board.\nThe 8 inch Starlight Kit allows you to create abstract galaxies using the effect of a cube within a cube. Because of the angles of the inner cube, the light seems to appear from a space beyond.\nThis kit contains everything you need to create both the outer 8 inch cube and the inner 4 inch Medium Cube.\nWe're desiging a custom circuit board\nWe want you to take these in your own direction. Our boards are open-source and Arduino-compatible. You can write new code, modify the board, or build your own remixes! \nWe use individually-addressable LEDs that animate and change independently. The final boards will be powered over USB and easily reprogrammed for custom animations.\nOur prototype circuit boards. We moved from the early boards on the left to drive the LEDs on to more feature-rich and specialized custom boards.\n We started with rough, handmade prototypes to test out custom animations. As we developed the kits, we also upgraded the boards, allowing us to add several additional features, like powering and programming the LEDs over USB and listening to an IR remote.\nHere are some example projects\nThese kits are perfect for -  \nDo-it-yourself maker and craft projects \nBuilding your own art pieces or furniture \nShowing off collectibles, scale models, or 3D prints \nCustom signs, logos, or nameplates\nEducational projects to teach about optics and illusions\nand much more!\nStretch Goals!\nAs we reach new fundraising goals, we'll be able to add new features.\n$35,000 - Cube inserts! Pick 2 of the 6 inserts for the Small, Medium, and Starlight cubes.\n$??? - We'll add an ambient light sensor to the Medium, Forest, and Starlight cubes so that it can become a night light.\n$??? - More cube inserts! Pick 3 of the 6 inserts for the Small, Medium, and Starlight cubes.\n$??? - New bases! Flat bases are now included with the Medium and Starlight cubes in addition to the triangular bases! Also, special white versions of the triangle bases will become available for the Small Cubes.\n$??? - Audio input! We'll add an audio input jack to the circuit board and modify the animations to interact with the audio signal. If music is your passion, then put it in your universe!\n$??? - A rainbow of bases! We'll introduce limited edition base colors so that you can have all the color combinations you love!\n$??? - Wi-Fi - Control the cube kits from anywhere! Share and upload custom programs! Simulate the weather at home! More details on this coming soon...\nLighting and Care\nBecause of how the two-way mirrors work, the inside of the cube needs to be brighter than the outside for the mirror to be transparent, so the effect looks the best in low light. \nThe acrylic, especially the coated side, cannot be cleaned with tissues, paper products, window cleaners, or other harsh chemicals. The cubes should be cleaned with the included microfiber cloth, which can be used dry or with a small amount of soapy water.\nOur Story\nThe Road Cube - Part of our original series of cubes\nPocket Universes started as a collaborative project between Kat Moenk and Steven Sutton. Mixing art and science to create interactive art pieces, we are able to challenge each other to learn and develop new skills. \nWe are also collaborating with Jan-willem De Bleser, an Electrical and Systems Engineer working in radar and aerospace. A hobbyist and tinkerer, he consulted on the Pocket Universe hardware in order to add more interactivity, flexibility, and features.\nWe also had huge help from Eric Deren of Dzignlight Studios, who did the amazing motion control shots in our video.\nAs requested, here is a dinosaur in the cube. For science.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur team at Pocket Universes has already iterated through almost a dozen prototypes as we worked on the production process, animations, circuit design for these cubes. We've worked with expert Industrial Designers, Electrical Engineers, Entrepreneurs, and Manufacturers to ensure that our produce is designed for high-quality yet customizable manufacturing processes.\n\nWe consider the majors risks of the project to be:\n\nCircuit Board Sourcing - For the circuit boards, we've selected components that are easily available from multiple sources, board designs with simple and clear tolerances, and we're working with professional service organizations to pick and place the board. We'll be using bed-of-nails testing to test power and program each and every board and we have plans in place for different scales of production.\n\nFabrication - We plan to do the fabrication ourselves on a small scale, but we will hire one of two fabrication services that we've talked with based on just how much we'll need to get done. We've worked through this project so that it can flex and expand to any scale we need.\n\nFulfillment - For fulfillment, we're working with a really great third party provider to ensure that our deliveries go out on time and stay cost-effective at any scale.\n\nSetbacks do happen, so we plan to keep communication humble and open. If unplanned delays do happen, we'll communicate that out in updates with specific details and do our best to stay ahead of them.\n\nWe will have more information and updates available on our website at www.pocketuniverses.com\n\nThank you all so much for your support!

High quality and precession craftsmanship. It\u2019s everything that was promised.\u201d \u2013 Anthony Mendez\n\u201cThis is one of the best things I\u2019ve received from Kickstarter. Really impressed with the quality and well worth the wait.\u201d \u2013 Victor\n\u201cToday I experienced the unexpected and I am glad that mininch was in my bag (^_^) \u201c \u2013 Ibnu Salim\n\u201cExcellent service and what an incredible tool this is! Thank you for making this tool.\u201d - Hans van Gent\n\u201cThe only thing wrong is that I should have got one for my wife, I can see it going \u201cmissing\u201d before to long.\u201d \u2013 Steve Buddell\nThank you very much for supporting our Tool Pen project in 2014. We couldn\u2019t make it a reality without you. We are sincerely grateful and highly proud that you love your Tool Pen as much as we do. It motivates us to work harder for making more good designs unremittingly.\nIn prior amazing Tool Pen journey, many backers fed back that they desired the smaller or jeweler sized bits for fixing some electronics, intricate equipment, mobile devices, glasses, and wristwatch, to name just a few. We heard all your voices, and we obviously loved these ideas. Since then, we have begun studying how to shape the mini-sized version Tool Pen, and we\u2019ve been tirelessly working away on developing it after the last project was finished.\nAs you imagine, these new mini bits are smaller and thinner than original ones which need the different type of mechanical & product design. Aside from that, lots of recessed screws on small electronics or some equipment are hard to be reached, thus a slender tip of the pen is quite necessary as well. After a rigorous assessment, we decide to create another sturdy, but svelte pen to handle all precision bits in the best way.\nAnd definitely, we still stay the smartest \u201cPop-A-Point\u201d design of Tool Pen. Rather than carrying many screwdrivers or a box full of bits, now you can flexibly collect and interchange all demanding bits like replacing refills of a pen. The bits will be compactly stacked within the barrel, and cycling them through is pretty fast & simple. It\u2019s lightweight & portable that you\u2019ll easily carry around and use it on the go.\nOne of the best things is all great features are retained. The bits sizes & icons are printed on all sides, and the window shows which ones are inside. The cap is going with a strong magnet built-in as well, to prevent leads getting damage and protect you from accidentally stabbed. What\u2019s more, we add a pocket \u201cClip\u201d on cap for Tool Pen mini. Hooray!\nTrust us, everyone will agree again it\u2019s a very polished pen in your hand.\nThis is the kind of mighty yet stylish multi-tool that makes your works more impeccable. Each Tool Pen mini holds up to 5 bits. The pen body is machined by aluminum with sand-blasting finish, and there are still three beautiful colors \u2013 Snow Silver, Gunmetal, & Champagne Gold for your choices. They will be absolutely the perfect companions with your EDCs.\nOn the other hand, we upgrade the material of these precision bits to high-quality \u201cS2 TOOL STEEL\u201d, which they are harder, stronger, and super durable for frequent use. There\u2019re 21 types of bits that applied to Slotted (Flat), Phillips, Star (Torx), Torx Security, Hexagon (Hex), Square, and Pentalobe screws. You can flexibly work on fixing multiple devices including small electronics, game console, laptop, tablet PC, mobile phone, toys, Meccano, music equipment, glasses, wristwatch, appliances, remote controller, as well as many household gadgets & personal ornaments etc. with a single \u201call-in-one\u201d pen anytime & anywhere.\nBits\n  Material: S2 TOOL STEEL\n  Length: 35.6 mm  /  Diameter: 7.1 mm  /  Weight: 4.5 g\n  Spec: 21 types are offered in first phase\nSlotted Bits (Flat): SL1.5, SL2, SL2.5, SL3\nPhillips Bits: PH00, PH0, PH1\nHexagon Bits (Hex): H0.9, H1.3, H1.5, H2 \nTorx Bits (Star): T6, T7\nTorx Security Bits: TR8, TR9, TR10\nSquare Bits: S1\nSIM Eject Tool: 0.8\nPentalobe Bits: P2, P5, P6\nPen\n  Material: 6061 aluminum, sand-blasting finish.\n  Length: 133.5 mm  /  Diameter: 12.8 mm  /  Weight: 46 g (with 5 bits inside)\n  Colors: Snow Silver, Gunmetal, Champagne Gold\nThe product you see here is actually the 3rd-run prototype we did. Developing this mini version was more difficult than what we originally assumed. The major challenge we met was the complexity of mechanical design for applying Pop-A-Point mechanism to this smaller pen & jeweler bits, not to mention that the tooling & CNC process for making precision items were also much tougher. So, we worked with our manufacturing partner (the same one who supported Tool Pen project) and attended to every detail over the past months. In the meanwhile, we were also knee-deep in executing on mass production of Tool Pen (and it was successfully fulfilled by last November). Frankly, we were almost burned out during that overlap period!\nFortunately, all efforts we paid were fairly worthy, this Tool Pen mini was finally come up. As mentioned, the material of bits has been upgraded to higher class \"S2 TOOL STEEL\". Besides, we change the shape of pen body being cylindrical, and mill additional flatten surfaces to enhance the frictional force and bring a close grip feeling. And the most important is our new design will make your Tool Pen mini dapper, lighter, and super-smooth for Pop-A-Point operation as well. We love it, and we believe you\u2019ll fall in love with it, too!\nOur products are designed and manufactured in Taiwan. We partner with a high-quality & 30-year-experience manufacturer who is professional in making wide-range screwdrivers & tools. With utmost efficiency and stringent quality gates along each step of the way, we are confident to fulfill this project and deliver your rewards on September, 2015. Here is our schedule & execution plan \u2013\nWe are a small team named \u201cmininch\u201d (pronounced by \u201cmini-inch\u201d), and all key members have great credentials with complimentary expertise in design, manufacturing, marketing, & project management. Some have also won numerous awards including iF product design award & Red Dot design concept award etc. Converging everyone\u2019s profession & experience, we aim to create good designs for improved lifestyles, moving from concept to production.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAlthough Tool Pen mini is the 2nd version of prior greatly-made Tool Pen, it\u2019s still a brand new product that will be constructed and manufactured from scratch.

We were the first students in the world to design, print, and test a 3D printed rocket engine, and now we are going bigger! The Vulcan-1 will be placed into the rocket body and launched in June making us both the first student organization to do so as well as the record holders for highest flight of a rocket powered by a 3D printed engine.\nTODAY IS THE LAST DAY OF OUR CAMPAIGN!!!!! We thank all our generous backers, but we still believe WE CAN DO MORE!!! Time is running out to make yourself a part of history!!!\nAbove are the design specifications for the Vulcan-1 Rocket Body. We believe that with this design we can achieve an altitude of 10,000 feet!\nVulcan-I brings with it new and exciting technologies to the aerospace industry, which have the potential to challenge the field's landscape. It\u2019s not only because we are a group of undergraduate students designing a liquid fueled rocket engine with 750lbs of thrust that makes this project unique; it\u2019s how we are building it. \nLike its predecessor, Tri-D, Vulcan-I is one out of a handful of 3D printed engines in the world. The very fact that students can design, print, and test a 3D printed rocket engine at a professional level is revolutionary. And why is that so exciting? Because it proves that students are capable of so much more than we realize! We are on our way to being the first organization to successfully launch a 3D printed rocket engine, and it would all be thanks to your support.\nOur accomplishments have the potential to revolutionize how space is reached. 3D printing dramatically lowers the cost of the most expensive part of rocketry, the engine. It also could prove to the world that we are more ready to be an interplanetary species than ever before. The possibilities are only limited by our imagination, but we need your help to get off the ground!\nAny level of funding can put YOU as a part of scientific history. Your contributions will go entirely toward our building of Vulcan-1 and helping us students show what humanity can do!\n \nFrom the entire SEDS team, we would like to thank you for your contributions. Your support will not only help us build a rocket body, it will help us shape how humanity gets into space!

My job as a product designer requires me to travel frequently, meeting clients all over the globe.\nLike many of you, I do my best to live a healthy lifestyle and a large part of health is proper hydration. I am also committed to minimizing the impact my family makes on the planet, and strive to set a positive example for my children.\nBut I found that without a superior alternative, resisting the temptation to buy bottled water while on-the-go was very challenging.\nWhether it\u2019s in the airport jumping between connecting flights, or taking a day trip with the kids in tow, I needed a water bottle that could fit my active lifestyle.\nALTERNATIVES TO BOTTLED WATER\nWhat are the alternatives to disposable bottled water that are eco-conscious, reusable, simple to use, convenient to carry, and easy to clean?\nMetal water bottles are sustainable since metal is recyclable, and most are labeled as BPA-free, but they are heavy, loud, and their bulkiness make them difficult to carry and pack away.\nPlastic reusable water bottles are mostly BPA-free these days, but are also bulky and inconvenient to store.\nFoldable, hand-held bladders seemed to be the most convenient alternative to the bulkiness of a bottle, but they tip over easily and when it came to cleaning them, it was an absolute nightmare.\nAs you can imagine, when I thought about \u201csuperior alternatives,\u201d none of these options seemed superior to me! \nTHE VISION\nTraveling on yet another flight home from a long business trip, I had a vision of a water bottle that was ergonomic like a traditional bottle, and would fold up to fit into my pants pocket or messenger bag. \nI knew this bottle design could be 100% BPA-free, taste and odor-free, easy to clean, and best of all, would fold up into a thin compact disc that could be stored virtually anywhere while on the go.\nMy mind was spinning with the possibilities!\nTHE BREAKTHROUGH\nAfter two years of racking my brain considering how I could help to change the way we think about disposable bottled water, I finally had an honest, fully-functional water bottle design worth sharing: The HYDAWAY. \nNow my passion in life (besides my family) is to share this product with you, and the world. Won\u2019t you please join me? \nAs a backer of this campaign, you are making a commitment to: \nDrinking more water and fewer sugary drinks to live a healthier lifestyle! \nReducing the amount of plastic we add to our landfills and oceans, by cutting down on the 50 billion disposable bottles we throw out each year!\nReducing our dependency on oil, by cutting down on the 17 million barrels of crude oil that go into making plastic bottles each year!\nTogether we can give everyone a convenient, safe, and environmentally-friendly way to drink more water!

Juice team. They truly are a business that is leaving an impact on people\u2019s lives and we love sharing their story and illuminating the greatness of OH! Juice for the world to see.\"\nCBGW: \"The ownership and management of Carlsbad Gateway Center is excited to welcome OH! Juice and Hanna Gregor as the newest member of our high-end specialty food community here at our business park. Hanna's enthusiasm and dedication to her exceptional product line truly enhances our vision to grow a local collection of entrepreneurs offering top quality, wholesome food product.\"\nThe Dailey Method: \"We couldn't ask for a better partner than OH! Juice. The combination of their knowledge in nutrition and their premium juices with our variety of fitness classes offers our collective client base a one stop shop for all of their health and wellness needs.\"\n The vision of OH! Juice was clear from the start, we knew if our core values shaped our decision making we would end up with a product people loved and truly needed. OH! Juice is off to a great start with a popular product line, loyal following and dedicated team, but now it's time to continue our success by expanding and reaching a larger demographic with a stable infrastructure! \nStarting off in the local farmer's markets we only hoped that people were going to love our nutritionally designed organic juices and the education to go along with them. It turns out that people in San Diego were looking for just that; a product that didn't cut any corners with educators to assist through all of the confusing \"claims\" of other products.\nIn the beginning when there were limited staff there were nights when we didn't think we were going to get out of the kitchen alive. We said things out loud we didn't mean, we tripped, fell, and dropped many juices due to exhaustion. This journey has certainly tested our physical demand as well as our mental toughness. \nWith the little to no money in our pockets you can imagine the stress, to keep everyone on payroll and to keep the customer's juice flowing. Doubts and worry try to trump our thoughts constantly, but we have to push that all aside to keep going. Being vulnerable and asking for help is a very difficult thing but we've had no other choice but to be resourceful and find what OH! Juice needs to thrive.\nThis happened at 4 a.m. before deliveries, GOOD MORNING!\nMeet Hanna: At the start of this campaign Hanna turned 26 years old and has already accomplished a lot so early by starting OH! Juice and leading the juice industry in San Diego. She is determined to keep growing by helping those around her accomplish their goals too. Graduating from The Pennsylvania State University in 2012 with a B.S in Nutritional Sciences gave Hanna the education the juice industry so desperately needed. Her taste for quality and competitive edge insures that each bottle is the best it can be. Hanna's vision is fueled by the results and testimonials she receives from her clients and can't wait to distribute her juices into as many new hands as possible.\nMeet Anna: Anna is actively pursuing a personal state of Chidananda, a state of blissful consciousness, through the incorporation of organic diet, yoga, meditation, and continuous education. Earning her B.S. in Nutritional Science from The Pennsylvania State University expanded her understanding of what it takes to make the finest juice on the planet. OH! Juice has allowed Anna to share her knowledge with others so that they might attain their ideal self. Her extensive experience with a clean lifestyle, along with world travel and culinary arts allow her to provide a unique perspective and help shape the vision of the OH! Juice team.\nHPP (high pressure pasteurization) is a new technology that bigger companies looking to grow fast through higher profits are using to extend their shelf life. Investors say plastic bottles equal more immediate profits but we say glass bottles are what the consumer appreciates and demands. They say HPP will make our juices last longer, meaning more profits but we say HPP is misleading; our customers want juices that are truly raw, vibrant, and freshly made within hours of their purchase. \nWe are trying to create a business that will survive the marketing trend of juicing with all of the misleading propaganda and provide a product that provides consumers with what they need, with juice that yields the results that they expect.\n\"The longer the shelf life, the shorter yours!\"\nMany investors approach us because they fall in love with the branding, the creators behind it, or they see the trend in juicing and health on the rise. This puts us in a tight spot; causing us to contemplate our mission, values and the burning energy inside. In the end we know we have to respectfully decline these offers with confidence, knowing we'll find the right type of support that will take OH! Juice in the direction that is best for the health of our clients, the environment, and our souls. \nCover of Discover SD as the \"Leading Ladies of Juice\"\nNow that we've stuck to our plan and created a truly amazing product we have clients who can't get enough juice and want it on a more regular basis. With school loans over our heads, and a small chance for a business loan this early in the game we naturally can't afford a storefront with the high overhead and initial costs, but that's okay because this financial roadblock has lead us to be innovative and distribute our juices in other ways then the traditional storefront model. \nWe teamed up with The Dailey Method San Diego who turned out to be a crucial partnership to OH! Juice. They allowed us to house our refrigerator full of juice and serve as a micro-storefront so our clients could have a pick up option for juices outside of the weekend farmer's markets.\nAs far as we've come, we've only just scratched the surface of what's possible with OH! Juice. We plan to expand our product line and cater to a larger demographic and range of health needs. We need your help to take it further, and make our vision a reality. Pledge money will go towards the following:\nPrivate Production Facility\nFirst things first, we need to lease our own private production facility! This will allow the freedom to produce during the hours most humans like to work. We currently work late at night, in the freezing cold (winter) or the blazing heat (summer). We've faced theft and damage in our current shared kitchen and it's time for us to have our own space to thrive. \nA couples months ago an opportunity for a wonderful space was presented to us. At first we restricted ourselves and the company by saying it wasn't in OH!'s near future and worried about the money that would go into the buildout of the kitchen. But then the gears started turning and we realized that timing will always be an excuse and that we had to make a leap and rise to the challenges ahead. Carlsbad Gateway Center believes in our vision because they signed a lease with us after patiently waiting 3 long months to save up everything we had for the down payment (school loans will just have to wait!)  We signed knowing it was time to take it to the next level, we signed because we want to make 10x more juice, we signed because we can't wait to show you what we have in store.. \nThankfully a talented and local architect generously scrambled to help us design plans for the new space and now we're off to the races! We have pulled together all the resources we could in order to get this project started and now we need your help to finish it by furnishing it! \nNEW FACILITY DESIGN, please OH! please!\nInside we will need the following to be compliant and up to health code:\n 2, 3-compartment sinks- $3-5,000, Craigslist or Webstaurant \n2 hand washing sink- $400, Webstaurant\nWalk-in cooler- $12,000 \n96 ft of commercial grade racks w/ wheels- $2,000, Webstaurant\n50 ft of stainless steel prepping tables- $3,000, Craigslist & Webstaurant   \nFRP (type of wall layering for easy wiping)- $1,500 + Installation, $500, Home Depot \nMop sink- $250\nSecret piece of machinery that we would not like to expose to competitors- $4,000\nBottling equipment- $3,500\nWater Heater- $1,800\nOffice furniture, Employee lockers, etc.- $1,100\nDisplay Cases for the Juices - $4,300\nTransportation\nSecondly, we will need a reliable source of transportation. We currently deliver in an old astro van that isn't insulated, we use coolers and lots of ice to keep the juices cold as we make the deliveries. This makes for a very physically demanding day as well as an inefficient system due to the heavy loading coolers and the lapsed time of preparing deliveries out of the back of the van. The van is old and gives us problems every month creating unnecessary money issues. We will find a dependable insulated van that keeps the juices cold and dry without ice, more room so we don't have to bungee cord strap everything down and better gas mileage to reach all of San Diego.\nPotential options below:\nChevrolet Express, 2009, 15,876 miles, $20,995\nChevrolet Express, 2013, 16,316 miles, $35,850 \nGMC Savana, 2014, 254 miles, $34,550\nFord E250, 2013, 7,500 miles, $33,500\nLocal Delivery\nWe want to be San Diego's New Age Milkman and deliver weekly six packs and cleanses right to your door in insulated carriers so you have FRESH, ORGANIC, COLD-PRESSED, RAW juice all week long!  Do you remember getting fresh milk in glass bottles delivered right to your doorstep? Well its 2015 and it's time we bring back a little old school convenience with some new age health involved. Leave your empties and get fresh refills, sounds like you have no more excuses to not take care of yourself! \nShipping\nWith the completion of the new production facility we will roll out shipping to our clients on a regional level and then sooner after nationally once we meet a consistent amount of orders to keep the rates low. With custom insulated boxes, dividers and ice packs we've found a way to get cold-pressed juice in glass shipped in a speedy transition right to your door. That means whether you desire a monthly cleanse or a weekly fulfillment, you will receive it fresh and in an efficient cost effective way.\nTransparent Production Facility & Tasting Room\nWe want to share the experience of juicing with you through our one of a kind tasting room! Instead of going to a brewery or wine cellar to detect the notes of different spirits, make a healthy decision to visits the Country's first interactive kitchen. Imagine sitting down to the bar where all you find are healthy tonic shots, green juice and healthy happy hour appetizers while watching everything made right in front of you.  We want to create a space where people can come take care of themselves while learning more about the process of juicing and the benefits of incorporating more organic whole foods. This visually stimulating experience will be energizing and eventful for all ages. \nIn It To Win It!\nWe've saved up over the last 8 months at the markets and with our own personal savings to buy the following: \n3 double door fridges- $8,000, Craigslist & Webstaurant online store \nJuicers- $35,000, Ebay & GoodNature \nKitchen small ware- $8,500, SD Restaurant Supply \nCoolers- $1,050 Lowes, Home Depot\nMarketing Material- EZ Up tents, tables, banners, decor etc. - $4,800\n2003 Astro Van- $4,000, Good Ol' Craigslist \nThe truth of the matter is that we save and save, we keep putting money back into the company, almost 80k has come out of pocket to attend the markets and get the machinery needed to simply provide juice for the community, but it took us month after month to do so. We've deferred school loans and made many personal sacrifices and now we've hit a roadblock that can't wait another year for us to save. This is why we really need everyone to help us reach economies of scale so we aren't forced to give up on how far we've come ourselves.\nEducation is very important to us at OH! Juice. We want our clients to make informed decisions around their purchases and be in the know about what they are putting into their bodies. Nutrition and health are often ignored and given very little attention in our country. Sadly this has lead to a sick, tired over weight population who feels defeated.  We know this can all be reduced by a good diet and regular exercise. Learning and knowing about the benefits of cold-pressed juicing and the healing capabilities of all the different nutrients that come in our juices motivates our clients more than if they were to buy it off a shelf. \n Help us by sharing OH! Juice with any and everyone!\nKnow someone who would be just as stoked as you are about OH! Juice? Share our campaign with them through the \"Share this project\" button at the top or below. Sharing is caring!\nAside from the mental and physical demands, there's something deep down that tells us it's not over, with our expertise we believe it's our jobs to provide what the people need. We couldn't imagine our clients lives without our products and services, waking up to check our emails and not reading the messages that say we've changed their lives, we couldn't imagine saying good-bye to OH! Juice and everyone who is a part of it. Please help us reach our goals and spread the benefits of a genuine product that won't compromise it's core values for dollar signs! Anything you can do to help us stay afloat and thrive is greatly appreciated! \nSold out, but we want to make more!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nObstacle 1: We've always have had to throttle sales because people fell in love so quickly with the product and what it did for them that we gained immediate traction. Since then we've been solely focused on building the infrastructure around the model to sustain our current level of demand. After the infrastructure is built (kitchen, machinery and van) we will then need to switch gears into sales! We've been reworking our current sales manuals, but we will need to use our leadership and coaching skills to pass down the knowledge we carry to our employees. Honestly sales come very natural for both Anna and I because we believe in the product, know it inside in out, are great with people, and only sell the right thing to the buyer. \n\nThe challenge will be hiring and training the right people for our team. We've employed 2-3 sales reps in the last 8 months but there was never a tight watch on them because again sales kind of just walked through the door for us, now we will need to refine everyones techniques and lead by example for our current and new employees. We're confident that the strong infrastructure will free up time in the kitchen and will allow us to concentrate more heavily then we already do on current customer out reach and acquiring new clients-can't wait!!!! \n\nWe currently work with a PR agency, Olive PR Solutions. They have been one of the best things that has happened to us since we've started, they had an interest in our juice and were willing to do TRADE to develop a relationship. I know they will be excited to hear that they can do what they do best and let the floodgates open, where as before we had them helping with branding holding back not on exposure to throttle the sales to a level at which we could handle. \n\nObstacle 2: I can see ourselves facing expansion in 3 quarters after we fund our project and seeing the opportunity to open our 2nd location. This first project's model is so tight and has a lot of traction already that once the infrastructure is there our model will look even better to expand. As young entrepreneurs we will need to face the legalities, juggling, and managing our first business AND opening our second OH! Juice!\n\nWe are very resourceful and believe that we will be able to do this simply because we are in it to win it, we are not the type of entrepreneurs who want to hit a hockey puck model and go lay on a beach somewhere, we know for the next 10 plus years it's going to be hard work day in and day out. This mindset is the foundation to multitask with high spirits and start sharing our knowledge and recipes around juicing and healthy food to other parts of the country! We have strict core values and by no means plan to compromise those for a franchise or to just open as many as we can, we have a clear vision and each of its own will be just as local and meet the high standards of quality as our first OH!

We DOUBLED the capacity to 6000mAh and added a SECOND USB port but most importantly, MORE THAN DOUBLED the output to 2.4A.

Why carry around anything else when you can have a wall charger AND battery backup in one compact device? Whether you\u2019re charging your device on the wall or on the go, BOLT\u00b2 seamlessly integrates into your everyday life ensuring that you\u2019ll never run out of battery again.\n BOLT\u00b2 currently only supports US plugs, but it can be used internationally with a simple plug adapter for your region.

The additional funding will give us the budget we need to film time-lapse of mycelium, giving the perspective of lifting up the forest floor to reveal the mysteries of this underground network. \nAn all-star team of artists, scientists, doctors and explorers are joining forces to create a life-affirming, mind-bending film about the mushroom and its mysterious root-like structure: mycelium. What they reveal will blow your mind, and possibly save the planet. Join us in this Year of Soils (as declared by the United Nations) to learn more about this critical solution for climate change.\nHere's Louie Schwartzberg and Paul Stamets discussing the film:\nFantastic Fungi is an important scientific exploration and visual journey through the exotic, little-known realm of fungi, directed by Louie Schwartzberg, an award-winning master of nature imagery, special-effects cinematography and storytelling that is both informative and inspiring.\nWe begin with our cameras exploring a vast and startling realm. We discover fungi\u2019s enormity; the largest organism on the planet is a 2,200+ acre mycelium fungal mat more than two thousand years old! We experience their beauty; our cameras capture jewel-like mushrooms in countless shapes and in brilliant colors, from pink and yellow to turquoise. And, ultimately, we realize fungi\u2019s potential; the film takes us on a journey that reveals mycelium as the key to the regeneration of our living planet.\nMesmerizing time-lapse imagery reveals their remarkable toughness, as mushrooms power up through dead wood and stone-hard asphalt. As we watch fungi turn solid rock into soil, we grasp a key mechanism of life on Earth: fungi are not just decomposers, but composers continually producing the ingredients of new life, sustaining our ecosystem.\nBut these small, mighty miracles don\u2019t stop there. The complex chemistry of mycelium produces antibiotics powerful enough to prevent many diseases and to stop pandemics, even an E.coli or smallpox attack by terrorists. Legendary researcher Paul Stamets explains, \u201cOur strongest existing antibiotics come from fungi. They fight off the same microbes we do with defenses we can use.\u201d\nPaul goes on to explain that expanding fungi-generated soils around the world could absorb vast amounts of carbon dioxide and help control climate change. These organisms can be fantastic allies in our efforts to protect ourselves and to rejuvenate our entire ecosphere.\nYES! An artistically-shot, scientifically-sound, life-affirming film about mycelium: the incredible, intelligent network under our feet that has the proven ability to restore our ecosystem, repair our health, and resurrect our symbiotic relationship to nature. Fantastic Fungi aspires to be an educational, inspirational, and ultimately critical film that explores the uses and benefits of fungi in three critical areas.\nFirst, we uncover the research that shows mycelium as a viable alternative to western pharmacology, including treatment for breast cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and PTSD. Second, we reveal studies that point to mycelium as a solution to our gravest environmental challenges, such as toxic oil spills and colony collapse disorder. Finally, we marvel at mycelium's proven benefit on shifting consciousness and aiding in deep personal transformation. The research, discoveries, and anecdotal evidence we've gathered is astounding, particularly when shared through Louie\u2019s visual storytelling.\nHere's a sneak peak of our movie poster. Special thank you to Marianna Armata's photography. (Ooohhhh and aaaaahs are totally appropriate):\nYou\u2019re a filmmaker and you have a Hollywood producer? Why are you doing a Kickstarter campaign?\nSimply put, big studios won\u2019t make the film that needs to be made, can\u2019t tell the story that needs to be told and aren't bold enough to create the change necessary to shift our climate and consciousness. Through Kickstarter, we can reach engaged citizens like you who are motivated to create meaningful change and who want to be a part of this revolution. When you vote with your dollar, you send a message about what you value. This is how we ignite meaningful change.\nMushrooms are mighty miracles that deserve a mighty film - a film that can only be told from the front lines, from the doctors, scientists, and artists who have learned the language of nature. Together we can create the shift in consciousness needed to restore our planet.\nLouie Schwartzberg (Director, Cinematographer), brought you Wings of Life, a Disneynature film about pollination narrated by Meryl Streep, the 3D IMAX Mysteries of the Unseen World currently playing worldwide in collaboration with National Geographic and narrated by Forest Whitaker, and the ground-breaking Ultra HD nature series, Moving Art, on Netflix. Louie is a master at making the invisible visible, unveiling the mysteries that are beyond human vision. He\u2019s the recipient of two Clio Awards for Environmental PSA, an Emmy Nomination for Best Cinematography, The NAACP Pollinator Protector Award, the Jackson Hole Media Science Award for Best Immersive Cinema for Mysteries of the Unseen World, Best Theatrical Film for Wings of Life at the Jackson Hole Science Media Awards, Best Moving Picture Award from the Heartland Film Festival for America\u2019s Heart & Soul, and Best Film Inspiration at the Ocean Film Festival for Gratitude. He was recognized as one of the \"Top 70 Cinematographers\" for the Kodak On Film Salute Series. He has wowed audiences on stages across the globe including TED, Bioneers, NASA and Oprah\u2019s Super Soul Sunday. Louie directed and Lyn Lear produced What\u2019s Possible to open the UN Climate Summit in New York, and A World of Solutions for the UN climate Summit in Lima. His three TED talks have been viewed over 45MM times worldwide.\nPaul Stamets (Authority), the leading mycologist in his field, has discovered and coauthored several new species of mushrooms and pioneered countless techniques in the field of mushroom cultivation. Recipient of the Bioneers Award, the Founder of a New Northwest Award and National Geographic Adventure Magazine's Green-Novator and the Argosy Foundation's E-chievement Awards. He was also named one of Utne Reader's \"50 Visionaries Who Are Changing Your World\u201d. In 2014, Paul was chosen to be an \"Invention Ambassador\" by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the largest and most prestigious scientific organization in the world.\nHere's Paul talking about his hat, made 100% from mushrooms:\nPLAY\n\nLyn Davis Lear (Producer) is an activist, philanthropist and president of L&L Media.\nMs. Lear co-founded the Environmental Media Association (EMA) in 1989 to bring awareness to the public about global environmental issues through multimedia platforms. She is on the board of The Sundance Institute, the Los Angeles County Museum of the Arts and The Norman Lear Center at USC, among others. Ms. Lear has been given many awards, most recently, along with the honorable Al Gore, the UCLA IoES recognition for Environmental Excellence.\nMs. Lear has produced and executive produced several documentaries, including Cesar's Last Fast, which was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival. Working with director Louie Schwartzberg, she produced What's Possible, the opening film for the 2014 UN Climate Summit in NYC for Secretary General Ban Ki Moon. Together they created a second film, A World of Solutions, shown at the Lima, Peru climate summit in December. Both were simulcast around the world in six languages. Ms. Lear has a Ph.D in Clinical Psychology, is married to producer Norman Lear and has three children.\nDr. Andrew Weil (Contributor) is a doctor, teacher, best selling author and pioneer in alternative medicine. He is founder, professor, and director of the Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of Arizona and is widely credited for establishing the field of integrative medicine.\nOur Tribe also includes best-selling author and activist Michael Pollan, food author Eugenia Bone, permaculturist Michael Judd, educator Christine Fischer, Philosoforager Alan Muskat, Professor of Ecology Suzanne Simard, and others.\nWe are asking for $100K to push us towards the finish line for this film. $100K is only a fraction of what it takes to make a film, but we have incredible angel investors who have committed to matching our Kickstarter fundraiser up to $1MM! Your investment will be doubled by committed eco-warriors who believe in this film as much as you do.\nKickstarter is all or nothing. If we raise our minimum amount of $100K, we promise to make an incredible film that will change the way we view nature.\n*We\u2019re offering a special reward for the first 100 backers of $100 or more. Help us spread this message and build awareness about the power of nature to restore our planet.\nEvery penny (minus the fees paid to Kickstarter) will go directly to the \u201cFantastic Fungi\u201dmovie budget - i.e. your money goes directly to the making of this film.\nWant to read more about our cast or simply learn more about the mighty miracle that is the mushroom?

Fittingly, he started it off with a Kickstarter campaign. The campaign achieved its $135,000 fundraising goal on Tuesday, and by Thursday morning Ries had more than $170,000 in pledges.\"\u2013\u2013Vox\n\"Ries turned to Kickstarter as an experiment in research, writing, and marketing. He didn't want to write in a vacuum.\" \u2013\u2013Fast Company\nHi, my name is Eric Ries. I\u2019m an entrepreneur and the author of The Lean Startup. \nSince writing The Lean Startup, I\u2019ve traveled around the world, helping companies of every size adopt the Lean Startup approach. In just five years, the Lean Startup movement has grown and transformed in ways I never could have imagined. I\u2019ve worked with founders developing new apps, entrepreneurs at hypergrowth pre-IPO tech startups, and managers at the largest, slowest, most heavily-regulated and bureaucratic organizations in the world. \nThat's me!\nFor all of the enthusiasm I\u2019ve witnessed, though, I\u2019ve seen a lot of people who immediately \u201cgot\u201d it then struggle after experiencing the challenges that come when trying to build a new company or transform an existing one using this methodology. My work lately has revolved around helping people overcome those obstacles and set up systems, team structures and ways of working that support continuous innovation and sustainable growth.\nAnd now, I want to share what I've learned with you.\nThe Leader\u2019s Guide will be a 4-color, 250-page, hardcover and digital book offered exclusively through Kickstarter. In fact, I made an agreement with Crown (my publisher) that it will only be offered to Kickstarter backers and only for the length of this campaign. It cannot be sold in bookstores. \nThe Leader\u2019s Guide is aimed at entrepreneurs, executives, or anyone leading a project or team. It will be full of stories about how companies both large and small are adopting Lean Startup methods to scale successfully and operate in conditions of extreme uncertainy.\nThe Leader\u2019s Guide is for both those who are new to Lean Startup as well as those who love the methodology in principle, but want to know more about how to put it into practice. It will include lots of real-world examples about how entrepreneurs are tackling questions like:\nHow can I convince my team that testing our early ideas with customers does not mean they should sacrifice quality or forget about our vision?\nHow can I convince senior leadership that innovation projects require a different system of accounting? \nHow can I do Lean Startup-style experimentation in a highly-regulated industry? \nHow can I incentivize and reward my team for working in a cross-functional way?\nHow can we turn functional specialists in areas like IT, HR and finance into allies when it comes to supporting new ideas?\nI think of The Leader\u2019s Guide as a kind of master class in applying the Lean Startup methodology. I can\u2019t possibly work with all the companies who ask for help, but I can do my best to translate the work I do into book form. The Leader's Guide will also answer some of the most frequently-asked questions and dispel the myths surrounding the Lean Startup, as well as include tips and tricks from people who've been using the method successfully.\nSo if you\u2019re just discovered The Lean Startup, you're a practitioner who wants a deeper dive, or you\u2019re at a company trying to incorporate it at scale, this is a great next step. \nThe Leader\u2019s Guide in both its hardcover and digital formats will ship to backers in late 2015.\nThe Leader\u2019s Guide will give you the tools you need to execute Lean Startup principles in a wide range of environments\u2014but I have another goal in sharing it with you.\nThis campaign is also an experiment designed to see how I can collaborate with all of you as part of the research process for my next book (working title: The Startup Way). I want to capture the experiences, stories, and learnings of those who support this campaign as they put these ideas to use. \nI want to see what happens when these ideas escape into the wild. \nWe live in a highly-connected world that allows authors like me to get and give instant feedback to and from their readers. I have benefitted from this collaborative landscape at every stage in my career as an author. I tested the concepts at the foundation of The Lean Startup in talks and workshops and on my blog. And as I was writing that book, I had a trusted team of advisors who shared their feedback with me at every step of the editorial process. \nI want my new book to be researched, written and published in a way that is consistent with the methodology I believe in\u2014and Kickstarter provides a platform for an even deeper level of collaboration with my readers. This will be an entirely new kind of publishing process for me, and one that I hope delivers a great deal of learning about how to publish a book successfully in the 21st Century.\nFor someone who loves the experimentation process as much as I do, this is a thrilling proposition. I know how many of you share my love of the Lean Startup, who believe deeply in its potential to create stronger, leaner companies full of people who know that their work has value and their time is not being wasted. And so it's my hope (and my hypothesis) that you'll want to come along for the ride.\nI think of The Leader\u2019s Guide as a kind of roadmap\u2014but maps can only take us so far. \nOne of the things I love about Kickstarter is that it allows backers to engage not only with creators, but also with other supporters and community members. It's an ideal platform for continual learning\u2013an idea at the heart of the Lean Startup methodology. \nAs part of this campaign, I will develop a backer-only community where you can share your experiences, meet and learn from other backers, and interact with me and our entire team during the writing and research process of my next book. \nThis online discussion community will be 100% private to backers of the campaign. Our team will share early drafts and ask for feedback, participate in discussions, and ask for advice about which tools and material have been useful and which haven't. We'll ask backers about their own stories and experiences, and how they align and diverge from those in The Leader's Guide.\nThis will make sure that the learning will continue after the campaign ends.\nThe Lean Startup counts among its fans and supporters some of today's smartest entrepreneurs, investors, and business thinkers\u2014and they're kicking in some incredible rewards.\nThose of you who have followed me for a while know that when I launch something, I love to go big\u2014ridiculous even\u2014in offering extras to the early adopters who support my work.\nBeyond making The Leader's Guide available exclusively as part of this campaign, I've asked my friends to donate what I think you\u2019ll agree are spectacular rewards, once-in-a-lifetime experiences, and invaluable mentorship opportunities.\nOur mentors.\nWe\u2019ve created several different backer reward levels. \nAt the first level are a number of packages aimed at individuals who are new to the Lean Startup or want a deeper dive: these packages include books, videos, tools for developing your startup, and more. \nAt the second level are rewards aimed at leaders and their teams: here, you\u2019ll find some cool mentorship opportunities, tickets to The Lean Startup Conference and other events (both virtual and live) and more. \nAt the third level are experiential rewards\u2014opportunities to meet with leading VCs, thought leaders and entrepreneurs who are having a huge impact on the startup landscape. \nAnd finally, we\u2019ve also included some high-level mentorship and workshop opportunities aimed at leaders who are ready to start implementing Lean Startup throughout their organizations. \nI\u2019m going to spend 100% of the money I receive on the research, writing and production of The Leader's Guide, and on the cost of the campaign itself (including the new private online community just for backers). \nI have assembled an all-star team to help me with the huge undertaking of producing and self-publishing a book based on five years of material with a very tight editorial deadline. \nIf I meet my funding goal of $135,000, I\u2019ll set stretch goals and add cool bonus rewards for all backers at different funding levels to help share the campaign wider. The more people we can get to back the campaign, the more valuable the experiment becomes to everyone who backs it. \nAnd thanks to the support of Crown, everyone who pledges for The Leader\u2019s Guide will get my next book, too.\nAs the Lean Startup movement moves into new sectors and industries, I get constant requests for more stories about how people are using these ideas in new and unexpected ways. And so I\u2019m very excited to share these stories with those of you who want to play a role in my experimentation process. I can\u2019t wait to discover what I might learn from the process of writing and publishing a book in this new way.\nA project like this is a massive undertaking. To make it happen, I haven enlisted a world-class team to help make it a reality on an aggressive schedule. \nChristy Fletcher is the owner of Fletcher & Company, one of the leading management firms working with writers/creators for publishing & business/media strategies.\n\nAlex Daly is a crowdfunding consultant, and the founder of Vann Alexandra.\n\nSarah Rainone is a writer and editor who works with Eric to develop content for his consulting practice. \n\nDavid Cirilli is a communications consultant with an expertise in implementing full-scale marketing and messaging campaigns.\n\nSylvie Greenberg works at Fletcher & Company helping authors strategize & execute marketing, publicity, and speaking opportunities. \n\nHeather McGough and Melissa Z. Moore are co-founders of Lean Startup Co. and executive producers of The Lean Startup Conference.\n\nThe Lean Startup Conference\nThe Leader\u2019s Guide is based on many of my private notes and case studies, but we still have a lot of work ahead. We have a massive pile of material that needs to be organized and edited. And we still have more research to be done: dozens of interviews both with people I\u2019ve worked with and\u2014more importantly\u2014people I haven\u2019t.\nWe also want to stay true to the Lean Startup methodology by testing the material in workshops and getting your feedback. We want to deliver a book to you that\u2019s comprehensive, user-friendly, and beautifully designed. \nI cannot wait to share this material. I'm consistently moved and humbled by the hard work and dedication of the Lean Startup community. Anyone who tells you that building a startup or driving a lean transformation is glamorous has not experienced how much of the work is about measurement, accountability, and being brutally honest with yourselves and your colleagues. And yet that hasn't stopped you from learning from your failures and from taking Lean Startup practices into industries and segments where no one believed it would work.\nI hope you share my excitement about this experiment. I look forward to hearing about your experiences and sharing the stories and tools that are helping others work in this new way.\nThank you.\nEric\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're working hard on mapping out our editorial timelines to ensure that we will deliver rewards to you on time.\n\nMy team and I have decades of book publishing between us and we are comfortable working with each other and with demanding editorial deadlines. However, there can always be delays during an editorial and printing process that could result in pushing a ship date.\n\nSince the nature of this project is collaborative, we will keep you informed throughout the editorial process of our progress and major milestones, as well as any delays.\n\nMuch of the preliminary research of The Leader's Guide has been completed, but I will plan to spend 3-4 months writing and researching the remainder of the book in order to have a manuscript ready for design and copyediting at the end of July. \n\nThe copyediting and design process will begin in mid-July and end in the beginning of September. As soon as there is a designed final file, it will ship it to you as an eBook immediately\u2014sometime in early-mid September. The printing and shipping process will take another 1-2 months, approximately, and that final hardcover books will ship to you in December 2015.\n\nWe plan on working closely with the design team and printer to ensure the smoothest production possible and, if funded, will update backers regularly on each step of the process.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #50", "update_userinfo": "The Leader\u2019s Guide Audiobook", "update_content": "I'm excited to announce that we\u2019ve partnered with Audible to release The Leader\u2019s Guide as an audiobook.

I wanted to create a tool that could produce a Cartesian graph with the push of a button, as an alternative to redrawing it over and over again.\n My motivation to create such a tool came not only from my experience as a math student, but also from seeing my fellow classmates doing their work. I began to carefully study my classmates homework and taking note of what characteristics they have in common. What type of paper do they use to do their math home work on? What size graph do they draw? How important are aesthetics to my fellow classmates? Would such a tool be useful to them? Would they use it? After conducting some data collection I felt confident that there was indeed a need for such a tool. \nAfter my calculus Professor, Mr. Don Murray, took five minutes out of lecture time to give a speech on the importance of accuracy while doing graphing problems, my decision to bring this tool to life was solidified.\nWhat I thought would be a fairly simple tool to create quickly turned out to be anything but. I wanted it to be neat looking, reliable, user friendly and most importantly, functional. I quickly realized I would have to team up with the right people in order to bring my vision to life.\nI contacted a good childhood friend, Chen, who had recently graduated college as an industrial designer and we soon began to bring our product to life. We called it \"CoordiMate\" (a fusion of the word \"Coordinate\" and \"Mate\"). Soon after embarking on our project we teamed up with another good friend, Barak, who brought years of product development and marketing experience to the table. \nAfter developing five Prototype iterations of CoordiMate, we finally had a product in our hands which met our desired quality and reliability standards. We have already sourced a reliable manufacturer and are now ready to share CoordiMate with the world. \nBacker Rewards\u2026", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any production venture, challenges may arise from time to time.

That's why we set out to create a secure, wallet solution with a slim and streamline design to fit all walks of life. By focusing on every detail, such as fit, finish, functionality, and aesthetics, we\u2019ve created a protective wallet solution in a class of its own. From the audible click-closure access drawer to our patent pending push and slide release system, we have gone above and beyond to transform the iPhone wallet into a secure, discreet, and stylish everyday solution.\nPush doesn't use elastic bands, pull-tabs, or bulky hinges. Other smartphone-wallets loudly display your cash & cards on the back of your phone-where over time they can even fall out. Shake it as hard as you can or drop it, Push can handle it. Push's front-facing wallet offers unrivaled security because your cards cannot fall out given any situation. This gives you the confidence that your essentials are completely concealed, safe, and secure no matter where you go and for your eyes only.\nPush is treated with a high-quality easy grip surface, giving it an elegant and fashionable finish with a smooth touch feel. The White Glacier, Pink Passion and all Artist series models come glossy with artwork professionally printed by an industrial sublimation service (the identical method & quality used by the highest end cases sold in Best Buy and Apple stores)\nGet in the fast lane and gain the rewards of saving time and space.\nYou see it more and more everyday. Smartphone wallets are on the rise, and for obvious reasons. Just like the way of the camera, calculator, notepad, calendar, and even our mailbox. Smartphones continue to absorb the most useful parts of our day and pack them all into your phone, keeping all those things right at your fingertips. Shift your paradigm to a simplified lifestyle and upgrade to Push for your iPhone 5S, 5C and iPhone 5. Never leave home without it, and never lose track of your wallet again because the next time you leave it in the car, or at home on the nightstand, there's no need for panic, now-a-days you just call it & GPS track it.\nOn the back, there is a button. Press and slide the button up (toward the top of your iPhone) to instantly access your cash, credit cards, business cards, ID.\nPlace whichever contents you wish into Push\u2019s front-facing wallet compartment and simply slide it back in. When the storage tray reaches its final position, an Automatic Locking mechanism is activated, letting you flow through your day knowing that all of your essentials are locked inside, safe and secure.\nPush tags along wherever you go. For work, a workout, at school, on vacation, or another night out. Leave your wallet or clutch behind.\nPush is versatile and fits any occasion\nPush fits 3 cards or 2 cards + cash\nPush makes an impression on everyone as it's the ONLY protective case that offers a premium look with a unique user experience\nEasy Access to all ports\nBoth the headset port lightning connector are easily accessible\nWe are technology entrepreneurs and prototyping enthusiast who care about what we design and build, especially the relationships that come along with building something as user-friendly as Push. We started building Push for fun about year ago. It began as a quest to make the ultimate wallet which quickly led to a the ultimate smartphone wallet because using one allows you the freedom of carrying one less thing--and that fits into everyone's schedule. We set out to design a wallet that would carry us through the entire day without ever reaching into an extra pocket or purse. We knew it had to look slim and feel great. We were tired of awful wallet solution (i.e. bulky or a pain to use). Many prototypes and iterations later, we've arrived at the ultimate grab-n-go wallet solution that we know you're going to love. As backers ourselves, we look forward to sharing Push with you and hope you join us in spreading the word to make Push, a reality.\nDurable & Dependable\nPush is made tough. An injected molded polycarbonate housing gives you the drop-worthy protection you need to go about your daily activities with ease. Push uses an auto-locking mechanism with stainless steel springs to project the hidden wallet drawer open. Push is engineered with the highest level of precision and successfully tested @ over 30,000 uses per month with a 100% success rate. How many times will you open your wallet per month?\n3D Printers can make great test-prototypes\nWe contracted Absurd Realities in Orange, Ca. for final mechanical design of our prototype\nAfter many months of hard work Push is ready to for prime time! We have finalized our design and have multiple manufacturers lined up. The prototypes that we have been using for the past several months work exactly how the final product is going to work and we just need the green light to start production.\nThe Kickstarter community has the amazing ability to turn ideas into reality. Push is the result of a year of research + feedback and we\u2019re excited to see it through. We need your support to create the most convenient and simple wallet solution. With your pledge, you\u2019ll help get production started as well as help fund the manufacturing process and quality control required to create a premium protective wallet innovation like Push.\nWe're honored to offer you Push limited edition Artists Series cases designed by DabsMyla, Tyke Witnes and eBoy with more artists soon to be announced. These Limited Edition cases will only be available here on Kickstarter. These will NOT be reprinted or reproduced, so get them while you can.\nOur Pledge\nFrom product conception to delivery our pledge is to design and deliver innovative useful products. While upholding our integrity by exercising the true meaning of personable and caring customer support. This is our motto, and we live it everyday.\nWe look forward to serving and communicating with every backer. We see all of you as a very big part of our team. Without you this wouldn't be possible. So come along with us as we show you piece by piece through every update, where we show you precisely what it's like to design, develop, and deliver a quality product, every step of the way.

As a result, this will bring increased business revenue and investments to San Jose. Our proposal has sound fiscal management and is self-sustainable as a community snow park. I believe Bay Area Snow Park has tremendous growth potential because of the social media attention is has already received. For instance, the Facebook fan page has over 29,000 unique visitors.   \nWe anticipate $1 million to $18 million to complete this project, which will include retail and restaurants on site. The project is sized based on the amount of funding it receives from this crowd-source campaign. With the support of the millions of snow sport enthusiasts and by the City of San Jose, we will bring this project to life. As a nonprofit we plan to give back a percentage of profits to local high schools who participate in our after school ski programs. The high schools will use the money for college scholarships. This plan demonstrates how Bay Area Snow Park is committed to being partnered with the local schools.\nTHE SURFACE:\nGOAL: Raise funding through the community to show support for building a Snow School in San Jose. \nHow big will the slope be?\nAbout two football fields. The size of the park will be dictated by the amount money we raise! We can build a small park or larger and set the standard for the nation. \nVOTES: Over the next year, while you wait for the City's planning process to take place, you will be able to VOTE each month on current aspects of the design of the ski slope and features of the building.\nEach month you will have 3 options:\n1. Choose one out of 3-8 options Snow School comes up with each month.\n2. Submit YOUR idea, special request, slope feature, OR design your own mountain on our website and vote on it. Or \"Sponsor Vote\" your Friend's design.\n3. VOTE on the TOP COMMUNITY IDEAS!!! These are designs, ideas, features, and special requests that your community has voted on as must have.\nVoting starts on Valentines Day Feb. 14th 2014. So come show your love. At the end of this campaign you will receive an email confirmation and further instructions.\nTICKETS & PASSES:\nLive outside the area and love this idea?\n$10 pledges are important to us. Once voting begins you will be able to vote on which City and State we build our next parks. So with a small pledge you'll be able to vote on bringing this to your backyard.\nAfter we're open:\nDaily lift tickets: $37\nWe will never offer season passes so pledge today to get yours, instead we will offer a monthly membership.\nMemberships: $60 per month + $200 one time initiation fee ($920 annually) or get your discounted pass here.\nFast Pass: Once we open there will be two lines one for regular lift tickets and the other line will be for ski patrol, ski school, and fast pass. You'll be able to get up the hill faster and enjoy more runs! This pledge will get you access to the to the slopes for the first year. However you'll still need a day pass or a membership to ride. The fast pass is an extra perk added to your general admission.  \nUse of proceeds:\n All of the funds raised for Snow School will be invested into the development of this park in the Bay Area. No money will go towards salaries. \nThe money will go towards the environmental studies, blue prints, and other initial costs towards getting a permit. \nWhat happens if we raise all the money but the City of San Jose still says no? This is unlikely. We are confident that this will go through at this location, however if that does happen, the money will go towards building this park in another location. Still in the Bay Area, just not in San Jose. There are many locations in the Bay Area that a park like this could work. This money will go towards one of those locations if this one doesn't pan out. Our first priority is to our pledgers and ensuring that your faith is not misplaced. If this project does not work out anywhere in the Bay Area in the next 5 years, there will be a partial if not a full refund.\nWhere will the rest of the money come from?\nSnow School started this Kickstarter campaign to do two things.\n1. Give the people that plan to come here the opportunity to save a lot of money by getting lift tickets now.\n2. Give us the power to show the City that the community wants this park and the best way to do that is right here, raising the money through the community will make a powerful statement when this goes to a council vote. \nDirt brokering is a way we plan to make 2-4MM after permits have been issued. How? Most people do not know that the 3 most expensive things to dump at local landfills is concrete, tires, and DIRT. So we will give contractors, or anybody with a dirty problem on their hands a place to dump their clean soils (all dirt brought into this site will have a \"clean soils\" certification ensuring no toxic soil are present). \nSnow School is a pending CA nonprofit, however there is a for-profit business that will also be at this facility running the Bar, Retail and Restaurant that falls outside of the non-profit school area. So there will be room for investor at that level. \nWho are we and why are we doing this?\nWe are a group of investors, entrepreneurs, and experienced business professionals who have been skiers, or riders their entire lives. We decided to take on the challenge of making skiing more available. There are so many people we know that could never afford the cost associated with learning the sport. We want to change that. Make access to the slopes more convenient and affordable. Fueling the Snow Sports Industry by giving more people the opportunity to learn the sport.\nLOCATION:\nCapital Expy and Hwy 101\nPOTENTIAL PARK DESIGNS:\nAfter school sports:\nOne of our main goals is to create an afterschool skiing and snowboarding program. Where students from each high school will assemble teams and those teams will compete against each other for annual grand prize and scholarships that are divided amongst the team that wins. Also any students that enroll in the after school skiing and snowboarding program, will receive free skiing and snowboarding rental equipment, including helmets. This is just a few ways that we are showing our commitment to giving back to the community.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main challenge is getting a permit.

Its because of the unpack.  \nWe brainstormed a new way to pack - a way where you will never have to unpack again.\nMeet Rolo\nRolo seperates your clothing into clear transparent mesh sections. Your clothing will stay where you left it, wherever you go.\nThe attached hanging hook allows you to hang it up at your destination.  Rolo becomes a portable wardrobe, giving immediate access to exactly what you want. \nNo more digging in bags, no more pulling everything out to find something.  Its all right here in front of you.  When you want to leave you can simply roll it up and go.\nRolo was engineered to keep your clothing flat maximizing storage space, and minimizing wrinkled garments.\nWhen it is rolled up Rolo is the exact same size as a bedroll, allowing you to store your clothing on the outside of your backpack.  This frees up the inside of the backpack for other things.  \nWe wanted to make it versatile.  Hang it, attach it to backpack, or put it inside a rolling suitcase; Rolo will keep everything organized wherever you go.\nThe Story of Rolo\nWe were backpacking in Europe and we stumbled upon this really neat toiletry organizer for keeping your soaps and toothpaste together. \nThis little organizer soon helped us organize our phone cords, medicines, and all of the little junk that used to be all over our backpack.  There had to be something like this for clothing - right? \nAfter searching everywhere, and even running a patent search we turned up nothing.  Nope, not one. \nCheryl made our first prototype with materials from the local fabric store. With some hard work and a little time we had a real working design.   \nWe found a local manufacturer right here in San Francisco, they want to help us, but to meet the minimum order requirements we need your help.\nYour pledge will help us create the first official production run of Rolo travel bags.  You can help make this dream a reality. Be the first to have this new travel accessory and have more time to experience the pleasures of travel.\nMade in America\nWe found an awesome manufacturer based right here in San Francisco. \nThis picture was taken 10 minutes from the manufacturers office.  We know we can produce the best quality when we make it locally and we won't settle for anything but the best.\nRolo is going to be made out of high quality ballistic nylon or Cordura brand fabric.  It is lightweight and strong.  The mesh is high quality nylon hex mesh and we are working closely with the manufacturer to ensure durability.  The zippers are YKK brand and everything is manufactured in America.\nOur Production Plan\nRolo is following the common business plan as laid out in South Park:\nStep 1. Collect Underpants!\nStep 2. ?\nStep 3. Profit!\nWell, its actually a little bit more complicated than that -\nYour donations will help us purchase our first production batch of travel bags from a manufacturer here in San Francisco.  They have informed us that they can begin manufacturer as early as January or February 2014.  The manufacture process will take 4 to 6 weeks, and then we will rent a warehouse and have the product shipped there. We will then visit the warehouse for a quality inspection.  If everything is good, we will give them to a shipping company who will send them all over the world. \nInternational shipping is a challenge.  Even though Rolo weighs 1 pound, and has dimensions of 17 inches by 3 inches by 3 inches it will still cost around $30 to send it to Europe.  We are searching for creative solutions to curb this cost - there might even be a way to send a large shipment there first and then distribute locally.  If anyone has any neat ideas please send them along! \nYour donation is the spark that will ignite this dream.  We really hope you join us.  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have developed a thorough plan for fulfillment. Our manufacturer is local and will source the materials. We have a price quote, materials selected and their continual support. We have a shipping company standing by ready to ship the finished product out to everyone. We are still working out a RMA strategy, and will be available via email to answer any questions or concerns.\n\nRisks that we can foresee are possible material shortages, incorrect sample specifications, or other manufacturing setbacks. Shipping is also a complicated hurtle. There is Value Added Tax (VAT), customs duty fees, shipping costs, warehousing costs, and shipping costs - but a combination of quality research and an experienced shipping company will help us navigate this treacherous landscape. If there are shortages or shipping issues the worst thing that will happen is it will add additional time to the fulfillment period. We are committed to this, even if we have to eat additional cost to get it out the door.\n\nWe have a real working prototype, a company, a provisional patent, a trademark, and have taken all the necessary steps to ensure smooth execution of our plan.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "Rolo II is a reality, and wouldn't be possible without your help!", "update_content": "Rolo II\nIt has been more than four years since we embarked on this glorious journey to create the first Rolo Travel Bag.
