Money really helps, and every bit will be on screen for you.\nMarc Zicree here.  As a kid I loved STAR TREK, TWILIGHT ZONE, OUTER LIMITS, FORBIDDEN PLANET and grew up to write for such great shows as STAR TREK \u2013 THE NEXT GENERATION, DEEP SPACE NINE, BABYLON 5, SLIDERS and more.\nI often hear fans say, \u201cWhy are there so few good sci-fi shows on TV, and why do so many go south?\u201d  I can tell you \u2013 frankly, most of the network suits just don\u2019t get it.\nBut you and I do.\nSo when I recently got the idea of creating a new show inspired by the sense of wonder and possibility science fiction gave me as a kid, I realized I didn\u2019t need a network or studio to make my dream come true -- just Kickstarter and you. \nWe have a great show we\u2019re chomping at the bit to make \u2013 our video and website will tell you all about \u2013 and rewards that the geek in all of us would die for (especially the $250K rocket set).\nThanks for making it happen.

He has been nominated for the American Book Award, Hugo Award, Nebula Award, Humanitas Prize and Diane Thomas A ward, and won the Saturn Award, TV Guide Award, Rondo Award and prestigious Hamptons Prize.\nDoug Drexler is an Oscar and Emmy award winner. His credits include Star Trek -- The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager, Enterprise, four Star Trek feature films, Battlestar Galactica, and currently Defiance. He has also won the British Academy Award, a Saturn Award, a Visual Effects Society Award and is also a Peabody Award recipient.\nNeil Johnson\u2019s credits include eight Sci-Fi films including Alien Armageddon, Battlespace and Humanity's End. He has directed over 500 music videos for such bands as U2 and Manowar. Neil's feature film debut in 1997 is reputed to be the first digital film ever made.\nVisions of the future and space travel have long been with us, from the novels of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, to such landmark films as Fritz Lang\u2019s THE WOMAN IN THE MOON and METROPOLIS and William Cameron Menzies\u2019 THINGS TO COME.  But science fiction really hit its stride in the 1950s \u2013 there was a hopeful spirit of adventure, exploration and excitement, a feeling that the writers, actors, directors and producers were creating a future that we would all live to see.  \nStarting in 1950 and \u201851 with such great live TV shows as SPACE PATROL and TOM CORBETT, SPACE CADET, the film THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL and Ray Bradbury\u2019s terrific novel THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES, the decade continued to build on its strengths, each year adding to a shared universe of man\u2019s journey to the outer reaches of the solar system and beyond.  Robert A. Heinlein penned such visionary works as FARMER IN THE SKY, CITIZEN OF THE GALAXY, STARMAN JONES and HAVE SPACESUIT \u2013 WILL TRAVEL.  Isaac Asimov chimed in with the FOUNDATION TRILOGY, CAVES OF STEEL and I, ROBOT.  Arthur C. Clarke provided remarkable flights of fancy including CHILDHOOD\u2019S END, EARTHLIGHT and the short story \u201cThe Sentinel,\u201d which proved the basis for 2001:  A SPACE ODYSSEY.\nGALAXY, WORLDS OF IF, ASTOUNDING and THE MAGAZINE OF FANTASY AND SCIENCE FICTION provided top science fiction stories each month by the best writers working in the field.  Even the medium of radio produced classic science fiction tales on such series as DIMENSION X, X MINUS ONE and ESCAPE \u2013 and Charles Chilton provided the BBC with the wonderful JOURNEY INTO SPACE, whose three storylines \u2013 OPERATION LUNA, THE RED PLANET and THE WORLD IN PERIL projected Man\u2019s first trips to the Moon and Mars in marvelous, realistic and imaginative ways.\nHaving  grown up immersed in and beguiled by these extraordinary dreams of the future, I was determined to write, produce and direct cutting-edge science fiction for film, TV and books.  Over the last few decades on such shows as STAR TREK \u2013 THE NEXT GENERATION, DEEP SPACE NINE, BABYLON 5 and SLIDERS my dreams came true -- now we\u2019re committed to creating a thrilling new vision of the future inspired by those magic makers who first set us on this grand galaxy-spanning journey.\nTo answer two questions posed by our wonderful backers:\n1.  The $150,000 goal is not to do any exploratory research or for marketing -- it will actually allow us to MAKE the first of our four initial SPACE COMMAND films. A bigger budget will give you more effects, sets, actors, live music.\n2.  As amazing as it seems, we actually can make a high-quality, high-effect science fiction film precisely because of who's on our team.  We wouldn't try it any way else; most folks have no idea how to pull something like this off.  We do because of the work we've done and what we've learned. \nFor a demonstration of exactly what we're talking about: \nMarc's award-winning STAR TREK NEW VOYAGES episode -- it was made for under $100,000 and boasts over 700 effects shots.\nClick here to watch: World Enough And Time\nIf you love Science Fiction movies this is your chance to bring one to life.\nTell all your friends!\nThis Kickstarter Page Designed By JAM Studios\nOur Stellar Cast Talk About Space Command\nSketches from 21st century genius Andrew Probert, of our Space Command spacesuits.

Give me Wasteland 2 already.\" - Chris Avellone - RPG designer extraordinaire\n\"Brian was one of the pioneers for the computer RPG with games like Bard's Tale and Wasteland.  I would be very excited to see what Brian could achieve with a sequel to such a classic like the first Wasteland.\"         - Rob Pardo - ExecutiveVice President of Game Design, Blizzard Entertainment\n\"WASTELAND is the game that made me a gamer.  It's still my favourite game of all time, simply because of how influential and mind-blowing it was at the time.\" - Rock Paper Shotgun reader Zerosociety\n\"Shut up and take my money!\" - Eurogamer reader Arcam (amongst many others)\nWasteland 2 is the direct sequel to the first ever post-apocalyptic computer RPG. The original Wasteland was the inspiration for the FALLOUT series of games, and the first RPG to allow players to split parties for tactical considerations, to face players with moral choices, and to make them deal with the consequences of their actions. It was the first to provide far more than the one-key-for-one-lock style of puzzle solving. It was groundbreaking, which is why IGN named it one of the top 25 PC games of all time, Computer Gaming World named it the Adventure Game of the year in 1988, and it was short-listed for inclusion in the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s current \u201cArt of the Computer Game\u201d exhibition.\nWasteland was set in a dangerous, post-apocalyptic world in the American Southwest. Over the course of adventures rangers would receive promotions, acquire new skills and equipment, then face new challenges with outcomes that changed depending on the strategy used to defeat them. The game featured a strong storyline which required painful decisions by players; and a storyline that allowed for maximum re-playability. Wasteland 2, with your participation and insights, will recapture all that and provide more.  It'll finally be the game worthy to be a Wasteland sequel, as challenging and rewarding as the original, with all added capacity and dazzle of games today.\nFor Wasteland 2, we\u2019re getting the band back together again!. Brian Fargo who Executive Produced both Wasteland and Fallout will be heading the team. Alan Pavlish and Mike Stackpole\u2014the original game\u2019s primary designers\u2014are coming back to put the project together, and we\u2019re rounding up as many of the other designers, like Ken St. Andre, as we can. On top of that, we\u2019ll have music by Mark Morgan of Fallout 1 and 2 fame. The storyline for Wasteland 2 was written by Jason Anderson who was the co-creator of Fallout. We have also enlisted the help of the amazing concept artist, Andree Wallin to help craft the Wasteland 2 world.\nA sample of Andree's other work can be seen below.\nBrian Fargo founded Interplay Productions (By Gamers, For Gamers) in 1983 where he went on to produce and finance some of the biggest RPG's made like Bard's Tale, Fallout 1 and 2, Stonekeep, Dragon Wars, Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, and more. Creating a new Wasteland will be a point of pride in the long history of games.\nNot a month goes by when an email doesn\u2019t come in asking if we\u2019ve ever considered doing a sequel. Emails from gamers who remember Wasteland fondly and want, just as badly as we do, to return to that gritty world where burning through clips might be the only thing that keeps you alive; and where running out of ammo will certainly get you killed. The fact that you, the folks who know and love and play games, keep asking for Wasteland 2 told us that there is a demand for it.\n\nSo, we\u2019re coming to you for support.\n\nFinancial.\n\nAnd creative.\n\nAfter all, since you\u2019re the driving force behind this game, we want to make sure that we\u2019ll be delivering the game you want. Wasteland is ready for a sequel, and with your help, it\u2019s going to happen. As for why you should want to participate, we\u2019ll let Kotaku point out why making Wasteland 2 happen is very important:  FanFundWasteland!\nWith your collective vision, the game that was the godfather to the popular Fallout series will become a reality.  Not only will you fund the development, but you\u2019ll have a voice in how the game goes together. We will have forums up for design discussion and soliciting your ideas for what will make Wasteland 2 rock.\nThis is your chance to influence the kind of game you want to see. With fan funding, you drive the direction of game design and development. If it is important to you, it is important to us. \nThis is probably the last chance for a Wasteland sequel.  We have tried to pitch this game multiple times to game publishers, but they\u2019ve balked. They don\u2019t think there\u2019s any interest in a solid, old school type of game.  This is our shot at proving them wrong. And more importantly this could help bring back an entire genre of RPGs. The power of the Indie scene continues and we see this as all part of a bigger trend of bringing control back to the developers.\nSupporting Wasteland 2 is nothing more radical than pre-ordering a game from your favorite brick-and-mortar store. We believe strongly enough in this project and in your desire to see it become a reality, that we decided to go ahead with this Kickstarter drive to fund it.\nNuts and bolts time.\nWe\u2019re going back to the original and building from there. No first person shooter, we\u2019re going top down so you get a tactical feel for the situation. And we\u2019re not ditching the party play to turn it into some hack-and-slash bloodfest. It\u2019s turn based, tactical, with a storyline that will be deeper and broader.\nWe\u2019re determined to keep the gritty, grim and satirical writing. We\u2019re going to pitch those moral dilemmas at you. You\u2019re going to be faced with the consequences of your actions.\nWe\u2019re planning on an initial 6 months of pre-production. We\u2019ll nail down every important element that you, our creative partners, want.  Once we have all that figured out, we buckle down for 12 month development cycle. During that time, players can get a sneak peek on a private closed beta through Steam.  In addition, we will be giving you constant updates and showing you our progress along the way.\nTo do this game right, we need to raise $1 million, but you'll notice our funding request is $900,000 and that is because Brian Fargo has offered to fund the last $100,000 if need be. That\u2019s a lot of money needed, but not when compared with the budgets of most full scale RPGs made today. The original game sold over 100,000 copies\u2014on the Apple ][ and Commodore 64 platforms back in the day. If everyone who played it then backs the project at the most basic level, the game is on.\n\nBut we\u2019re looking ahead to what we can do if you all back this project in force. At $1.25 million, the money will go primarily into making the world bigger, adding more maps, more divergent stories and even more music. \n\nAt $1.5 million, the world gets even bigger. You\u2019ll have more adventures to play, more challenges to deal with, and a greater level of complexity to the entire storyline.  We\u2019ll add more environments, story elements, and characters to make the rich world come alive even more.  We will even be able to bring Wasteland 2 to OS X and Linux! And after $1.5 million the sky is the limit.\nEveryone on the team is incredibly excited about the possibilities this Kickstarter will unlock. Like you, we\u2019ve long dreamed of being able to bring Wasteland back.  If you share that dream, if you\u2019ve always wanted to watch and influence the game design process from start to finish, this is your chance. If you\u2019ve wanted to change the world and get the games you really deserve, then do it by funding this Kickstarter.  The road to Wasteland 2 is there. \nJoin us on what\u2019s going to be a wild ride.\n***A big thank you to our (already) loyal forum users for their help in crafting the Kickstarter rewards.

This is my third attempt to get funding it. Being Three is my lucky number and serendipity and irony seem to be close friends of mine, Well i take as a good omen. \n                                        ^^^Cover Design^^^\nSavage Tattoo Magazine recently published an article on this project news stand date is Feb 14th 2012. if you found this project through that welcome. If not, try to pick a copy up!!!\nThis project was born on the fugues of coma dreams while i was healing from a near death experience  in early 2009.\nHere is that story...  i suffered a traumatic head injury in a home invasion in San Francisco this resulted in my being an a coma state for several. days While i was in that coma i had very real tactile yet surreal dreams, thing being in purgatory , on lsd with Salvatore  Dali ... some of those dreams i had EXACT visions of images like this one. i do mean exact imagine my surprise when i saw her on a stage in Portland Or.  \nIn this one dream (in the coma) was myself standing in a art gallery surrounded by photographs that were edited and made into art just you see here in this project i knew what i wanted to create but ,I wondered how i would do it for a long time because as a result of my injury i lost most of the use of my right hand (i was prominently right handed) and was worried. wandering a camera store asked was there anything for lefty's camera wise ? never has there been a left handed camera made , but i discovered a combination made by Sony a pro dslr that allowed me to take photos , left handed .... was off and running. \nSo i am publishing a coffee table photography book that will raise positive awareness of tattooing and women, showing them not as objects, but as powerful, intelligent & equal. This is an amazing project, it's helped me heal and grow and evolve as a an artist. After that experience  taking inventory life i realized that all my best friends are women, always have been, my mom and i were close , my grandma surely a huge influence in my world and i wanted to do something honored the women in my life, something that portrayed women as powerful , commanding of respect and dignity, that portrays just that. \nWhile tattoos are more and more a part of the mainstream culture and widely accepted heavily tattooed women still looked viewed as outside of the norm, stupid right ??? So i decide to put together a gallery shows and a coffee table book project of the power of a woman making the free will choice adorning their temples that is the human body. this project is going to about women with art on their bodies , women of every size shape and ethnicity.using skills and types of editing that i have learned and am honing to highlight the ink that is under their skin to present them to world \nEach \"Goddess\" will have 2 pages in the book. As well as a few paragraphs of what ever they want to write in their words about tattooing. No q&a bs questions see every where else.\nThanks again total amount i am collecting is is $3750.00-.  I have 60 days to make that amount.  Please also remember that if I don\u2019t raise this amount in the given time, I will get none of the proceeds. \nAs for what i need the money for , mostly the rewards. Studio space to rent of weekends to finish the project and a small amount for distribution to publishers. At the beginning I am self publishing. i just want to this out the world and people that appreciate it. In the hopes some day gain popularity and fame in a humbling fashion.\nIf i exceed $3750-, I will use that money to buy additional tools and materials to create more books and start an the next project called \" Tattooed God's\" The mens version of this concept.  As well as put the extra to a studio space to shoot in thats also a permanent classroom to teach kids how to do photography... \nOne more thing. When you contribute, you help more than my efforts to continue my work and to make this dream a reality.\nIf you have any questions at all (or you just want to confirm that I'm a real person) you can email me at chazz @ chazzarazzi com\nMy site www.chazzarazzi.com has a section dedicated to this. (working updating galleries) \nwww.facebook.com/thetattooedgoddess Honestly though , the book has a \"book\" page on Facebook that gets updated regualrly as i shoot more.
