[{"backer": "Brian Berg", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "What is Dungeon Alchemist?\nDungeon Alchemist is an AI-powered mapmaking tool for both players and dungeon masters. Simply pick a theme, start drawing, and Dungeon Alchemist creates high-quality maps you can print, share, or use in your favourite Virtual Tabletop Application.\nDungeon Alchemist is a standalone software app for Windows, Mac (including ARM) and Linux, which will be distributed through the Steam platform. We plan to release Dungeon Alchemist near the end of 2021, but the exact timeline depends on how much money is pledged in this campaign. If you choose to opt for an Adventurer (\u20ac45) or higher pledge, you'll get access to the beta program a few months before release.\nWe will unveil new features as we progress further in the campaign. If we surpass our funding goal, we will add even more content and features to Dungeon Alchemist for everyone to enjoy! Check out the stretch goals below.  \nDungeon Alchemist was created by Wim De Hert and Karel Crombecq, both longtime roleplayers. This project came from a personal need for an easy-to-use, convenient tool for making dungeon maps. Both working a fulltime job, we just don\u2019t have the time to design each map in excruciating detail, but we still want cool-looking tailor-made encounters for our campaigns. That\u2019s why we believe Dungeon Alchemist can really make a difference, and we are incredibly passionate about making it.\nWe would love to make Dungeon Alchemist available to everyone at a low price and with amazing content from the start. But the reality is that we have bills to pay, and to make this project as good as we want it to be, we need money to fund development. We truly believe it has the potential to be a game-changer, and we created this Kickstarter because we simply cannot build it without your help.\nWim De Hert is owner and founder of BlueJay Design Consultancy, and has over 20 years of experience in illustration and graphic design. While being an avid Pathfinder and Dungeon&Dragons player for as long as he can remember, creating Dungeon Alchemist has been an ambition ever since getting a fantasy game at the age of 7. Wim will be working on Dungeon Alchemist\u2019s lead visuals, concept design and modelling.\nKarel is an experienced game developer and senior graphics programmer. Karel has been in the game industry for over 10 years and has released games on mobile platforms and consoles. Before that, he earned a PhD at the University of Antwerp on machine learning and computer simulation. With a passion for video games and RPG\u2019s in particular and lots of experience programming games and AI algorithms, Karel is the perfect person to tackle this job! \nWe are a two-man team and we do everything ourselves. This means that we can use all the help we can get to spread the love! The more money we collect in this Kickstarter, the more time we can spend on developing Dungeon Alchemist and adding cool new features, and the quicker our app will be finished. Everybody wins!\nIf you want to help us fulfil our dream, you can do so in several ways:\nJoin our Discord Server and engage with the community.\nTell everyone about us on Facebook.\nFollow, retweet and engage with Dungeon Alchemist on Twitter.\nTalk about us on your favourite subreddit:  /r/battlemaps, /r/dnd, /r/dndmaps, /r/Pathfinder_RPG, /r/Roll20, /r/FoundryVTT,  /r/FantasyGrounds, ...\nThis campaign is promoted by Backercamp.

These unique dice supplement your standard polyhedral set with defined damage in each roll during battle. Available in Metal and Acrylic. Plus, uniquely functional and stylish dice for spells, saves, sneak attacks and class features.\nTins for the metal dice sets\nWhy We Want This\nOne thing was clear after the completion of our original Damage Dice campaign for magical damage types; folks wanted to get physical. With these dice you can roll a war hammer smite with a bludgeoning die and radiant die at once and know which damage is what. Different colorways for each design allow for rolling multi-attacks all at once and knowing which attack roll goes with which damage roll. Why should only casters get the fun of rolling big hand fulls of dice!  Mostly, this is about style. D&D is a game of color and theme after all, so it's nice to have a special set of metal piercing dice for your favorite rogue.\nMetal?! Yes metal. We want our damage dice to embody each type to the fullest so  metal seemed the obvious choice. The material allows for each design to further represent slashing, piercing and bludgeoning. Additionally, we\u2019ve created acrylic sets for a more accessible cost option (and we know metal isn\u2019t for everyone).\n Damage Dice Sets are special: \nJust like our magic sets, these sets are specifically designed for damage rolls.\nSets include what you need for attacks with standard D&D weapons \u2013 1d4, 2d6, 1d8, 1d10, 1d12 and a 1d20 (dice quantity doubled in acrylic sets). \nD10s are d10s, not half of a percentile set. You roll 1\u201310 damage, not 0\u20139 or 00\u201399.\nStylish custom molds with damage type in the design and edge\nTins for metal and embroidered bags for acrylic with the damage type.\nWhat else?\nSome of the stretch goals in our last campaign were dice that could have been their own campaigns, such as the bardic inspiration set. This time, we considered going a more traditional route; keeping the stretch goals to simple accessories \u2026 but seeing as a ultra-specific purpose-built, surprise dice sets are kind of our brand now, we figured why not! This is about bringing as many dice into the world as we can.\nHow We\u2019re going to do this\nWe\u2019re using everything we learned from our first project creating the magical damage types to make these even better. We\u2019ve already created some prototype molds and we\u2019ll need to make so many more molds. Each design requires a unique mold, and minimum order, so we need the community\u2019s help to bring these dice into the world, and onto our tables.\nWho is doing this?\nGyld is a small company in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Gordie, Al and James have pooled their free-time and free-cash into this and a few other projects in the name of creating items for table-top that we want to exist (and use).\nShipping Rates & VAT\nShipping and VAT costs are not included in your pledge. We\u2019ll be using Pledge Manager after the campaign which will calculate shipping based on your location. Estimated shipping costs are below, and may change based on location, rates and whatever weird stuff happens between now and the ship date (2020, as you may remember, was a little bananas).\nWe have arranged for UK, EU and Australian distribution this time so VAT will be handled in Pledge Manager as well so you won\u2019t have to worry about paying on delivery. NOTE: EU and UK are changing VAT rules for 2021 so we\u2019ll update this section once we know specifics.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe designs and prototypes are complete for this campaign which reduces our risk further from the last campaign. However, as we learned in 2020, anything can happen. The delivery estimate here is what we were able to deliver within even with a global-pandemic shutdown so we\u2019re very confident that we can make it happen, but then again \u2013 who knows.\n\nOne of the things we learned from the last campaign is that the best part of Kickstarter is working with the community to create something that doesn\u2019t exist, and that we wouldn\u2019t be able to make by ourselves, or at a big company. We can make weird, ultra-specific, dice that only work for one spell, like Chaos Bolt. We can take input from the community during the campaign and include it in the final designs \u2013 y\u2019all really got behind matte finish so we pushed it up - and that\u2019s what we love. So please remember that this is a pledge not a pre-order. We may change designs, finishes, ink colors or details based on the campaign and community input.

After having sold more that 4 million copies of the base game and over 8 million copies including DLCs, the time has come for Darkest Dungeon to move from the screens to your table.

Although brave and determined, adventurers are only human! They are prone to the madness and pain the twisted dwellers of the dungeons will inflict upon them. Death can occur, but is not the worst fate: heroes can be driven mad and beyond help!\nPlease note minis come unpainted.\nThe game is played in campaigns of 11 missions. To reach the Darkest Dungeon itself, players will undertake 3 missions per threat level and vanquish the boss. Then, they will be strong enough to face the horrors of the Darkest Dungeon! They may emerge victorious... if they dispatch the source of evil that plagues the land.\nPlease note minis come unpainted.\nFor each hero, select 3 skills out of 7 before heading into your mission (and level the heroes up to gain access to more skills). In each room, pick the most suitable stance to best resolve the conflict! Then, on each turn, a player chooses two of the available actions of moving, interacting with the environment, changing their stance or using a skill (if eligible for their current stance). Triumph over encounters, resist rampant madness and emerge victorious before throwing yourself into another battle. Between missions, spend your time in the hamlet, visiting various buildings to find relief from the physical and mental trauma you\u2019ve just endured. Restore the hamlet to its former glory and it will reward you and help you to fulfill the ultimate goal.\nRPG-like heroes  \u2013 A robust level up system with a ton of customization for unique playable characters.\nStressful Affliction System \u2013 Heroes' personalities are paramount!

Backers from these countries will not pay import taxes.\nShipping is not charged as part of this Kickstarter campaign but is instead done so on the pledge manager after the campaign ends. The shipping price you will pay is based on the weight of your pledge and the country to which it is to be shipped.\nThe above is a list of rough estimates for shipping. These estimates are based on the costs for our previous campaigns and an estimated final weight of the Core pledge at 5kg. Keep in mind that adding optional buys or additional pledge levels will raise the weight of your pledge and may also then raise the final shipping price.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGeneral\n\nThis is our tenth Kickstarter and we\u2019ve learned a lot from our previous nine. Producing thousands of products and coordinating their delivery to homes across the planet is a complex business, and there are many things which could go wrong. This is why we build in as much time for the unforeseen as possible. We want to ensure that we have the space to deal with any unexpected setbacks and still get your game to you before the estimated delivery date.\n\nTo give you a frame of reference for exactly when you will get your game, Mythic Battles: Pantheon, Time of Legends: Joan of Arc season 1 and Reichbusters: Projekt Vril have been delivered. Super Fantasy Brawl is going to complete fulfillment by the end of the month. Solomon Kane, a big scope project, is at the printer and will be delivered in two waves. In specific wave 1 is in mass production now and the wave 2 moulds are also now being produced. Time of Legends: Joan of Arc season 1.5 is on track and the first elements will be soon sent to production. Enchanters: East Quest has been printed and is going to ship this month. Steamwatchers is on track and will go to production soon, to make the March fulfilment. HEL: The Last Saga is currently in development.\n\nFor all our games, we communicate with our backers with regular updates on Kickstarter and on Gamefound (for our late pledgers) You can also find us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Discord, learn our news and project updates through our weekly Newscast and ask all your questions in our Q&A with Leo on YouTube every Wednesday evening.\n\nPlease note that the components, component counts, quality and rules, are all work in progress and subject to change.\n\nDelivery\n\nOur experience in our previous KS has shown us that there can be variances in terms of timing and remaining in schedule when it comes to anything produced in China, such as:\nProduction delays\nShipping delays\nCustoms delays\nAt the same time there are also the unpredictable factors; recently it was the Coronavirus outbreak, but there can be others such as weather conditions, strikes and others.\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is October 2021, but please bear in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nShipping\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials, and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented in this Kickstarter project.\nIf you do not finalise your pledge and pay for shipping by the closing date of the pledge manager, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the pledge manager has closed.\nIf you confirm your pledge by the closing date of the pledge manager, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and that outside of countries specifically listed as being \u201cfriendly\u201d (above) you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes or APO addresses.\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. All \u201cNo Reward\u201d pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed.\n\nKSE\n\nAs KSE, or Kickstarter Exclusives, are marked the products that will not be available to retail. Mythic Games retains the right to continue to sell those in the Pledge Manager, the Mythic Games website, as well as conventions.\n\nRefunds\n\nWe have a no-questions-asked refund policy.\nAll pledges can be refunded in full up to 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign. In addition, if any part of your order cannot be delivered, then we will reimburse you the full cost of this component regardless of the date.\nIf you apply for a refund more than 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter then we will only be able to refund 85% of it. The difference is the amount of the unrecoverable fees paid to process your order.\nOnce we have started to process and pack your order, refunds will no longer be available.\nRefunds within the first 14 days are reversed via Stripe to the credit card you used to pledge originally. Any refunds requested after the 14 day period may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe or your credit card.

You can find out more about our artists, including links to their portfolios, in the team section at the end!\nThe border of the old empire\nWithin the Age of Antiquity campaign setting you will find: \n\nEight Ancient Cultures: From across the east and west.\n\n Rome - Currently the most powerful single state, Rome has risen to great heights at a blistering pace. Though still a Republic in name, the powers of the Senate and Consuls have begun to wane in recent decades with the position of Dictator having become a permanent one. Though wary of slipping back into tyranny, the Senate is cautious in moving against the Dictator, who, as with Rome's former leaders, was personally blessed by Jupiter himself.\n\n The Greek States - A land of myth and legend, the Greek cities are still favored by the Olympic Gods even as Rome eclipses them. Though nominally under the protection of Rome their close religious ties have allowed them to avoid full annexation and enjoy relative autonomy. Outsiders (the Romans included) consider the Greeks one people, though they seldom see themselves this way. The artistic and fashionable southern cities often reject the notion that they are one people with the more martial northern states who in turn are loathe to be compared to their less militaristic cousins. \n\n Greco-Occupied Egypt - When Ra stood down from the mantle of the Egyptian Pantheon a power struggle broke out among the gods. Rome and her Greek allies saw this as an opportunity to permanently weaken a rival Pantheon. With their Gods warring among themselves, the Pharaoh and his armies were caught unprepared by the Greek invasion. Today the north of Egypt is ruled by a Greek-born Queen who finds herself playing a delicate game of balance between her ruling Hellenistic and far more populous Egyptian subjects.\n\n The Kushite Kingdom - Loyal sons and daughters to the Egyptian Pantheon, the Kushite Kingdom, led by the sorcerer Queen Amanirenas, continues the fight against the Greco-Roman conquerors that control much of what had historically been the domain of Ra.\n\n The Parthian Empire - The crossroads of civilization. Made rich by wealth and trade flowing across the known world, yet ever wary of being caught between a once more united China and a quickly rising Rome, the Parthians' unique position has allowed multiple disparate religions to coexist and flourish within their boundaries.\n\n The Warring States of China - Formerly the pre-eminent power of the world, China was recently thrown into chaos by the death of the last Emperor. Two dozen warlords with armies of varying strength and size now fight for control of this vast and ancient territory.\n\nStretch Goal - Unlocked\n\n The Celtic Tribes - Considered mysterious and primitive by the Mediterranean powers, the Celtic tribes, united under the warrior Queen of the Iceni, fight to repel the Roman advance through the isles. Dark rumors swirl about the Druidic rituals they perform deep within the untamed forests. More than one Legatus, finding his soldiers impaled and sacrificed, has declared the isles a cursed place. The Celts view the Romans with equal contempt, seeing them as heralds of foreign gods bringing only death and thralldom.\n\n The Illyrian Kingdom: The Illyrians of Dalmatae find  themselves in a precarious position. Placed between Rome and the Greek states they have long caught the eye of Jupiter who sees them as obstacle between his two domains. This was not helped by the Illyrian deity Deipaturos declaring himself the true Sky Father, a title Jupiter sees reserved only for himself. The Greeks, though openly supportive of Rome, often view the Illyrians as a buffer state preventing a land border that many fear would lead to full annexation by Rome. Some even say they've even helped the Illyrians against Rome with supplies and information, though these are still just rumors. The Illyrian King for his part has tries to foster this and keeps friendly relations with several of the northern Greek rulers.\n\n\n\n 12 New Archetypes: One for each of the base classes. \n\n\n\n\n 15 New Backgrounds: To give your characters more specific connections to the world. \n\n\n  52 Gods: From five ancient pantheons. \n\n\n 150 Magic Items: Drawn from and inspired by the ancient world.\n\n\nDozens of feats, spells and mythical creatures. \n\n\n We are aware that sometimes projects go overboard with stretch goal creep which can impact the release schedule. This is our first project and we want to make sure we don't take on more than we can deliver in a reasonable time frame, as such should we reach all of our stretch goals we do not intend to include anymore that add additional content to the book.\n\nCreated by: Stephen Delucchi & Marcus Lundin\nArtists - \nNikita Cherkasov - Artist Artstation \nSarah Delucchi - Graphic Design IMDB \nKurt Ian Ferrer - Environment Artist Artstation \nGaston Garcia - Artist Artstation \nTadas Sidlauskas - Artist, Cover Art Artstation \nRen Tu - Artist Artstation \nRachael Wong - Concept Artist, Logo Design Deviant Art \nShipping\nShipping will be collected after the campaign through Backerkit. \nShipping estimates are as follows.\nUS - $7.50\nCanada and Mexico - $22.50\nRest of the world - $27.50 ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe don't see any significant risks outside a slight delay if all of the art is not finished on time, but we have given ourselves enough padding with the release date that we don't see this as being an issue.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Centurion", "descp": "Get the full-color PDF of Age of Antiquity!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}], "stat": ["806 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "Primus Pilus", "descp": "A full-color hardcover copy of Age of Antiquity!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}], "stat": ["1,302 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 75 or more", "title": "Legatus", "descp": "The Limited Edition hardcover & PDF of Age of Antiquity.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}], "stat": ["1,037 backers", "Limited (63 left of 1100)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 250 or more", "title": "Pontif Maximus", "descp": "We will have a character named and modeled for you or your OC with a full color portrait included in the book.\nA full-color hardcover copy of Age of Antiquity!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "20 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #30", "update_userinfo": "Update - Address changes, Maps and Gods!", "update_content": "Hello everyone!\n\nHope you're all doing well and that you enjoyed the preview PDF 2 from last months update.

An event called \"The Reckoning\" awakened an ancient evil, and you'd best hope the howls you hear on the High Plains are just a pack of ravenous wolves...\n \"The Year is 1876, but the history is not our own...\"\nThese words introduced Deadlands to the world back in 1996, spawning decades of amazing tales and memorable monsters. Now the granddaddy of Horror Western games is back with a brand new edition. \nThe cover that started it all, the original Deadlands, by Brom!\nIt's now 1884 in the official timeline. The Civil War ended in 1871 at the Battle of Washington, an epic conflagration of steam and steel. The Great Rail Wars are over as well, finishing not with a whimper but the bang of  Dr. Darius Hellstromme's ghostfire bombs at the gates of Lost Angels.\nEven the Servitors, the Reckoners' chosen champions on Earth, have been defeated\u2014at least for a while. Reverend Grimme vanished in a massive flood that destroyed his city, Raven's Last Sons were defeated by the Great Summoning, Stone was foiled in the barren expanse of Death Valley, and Dr. Hellstromme's latest scheme to open the gates of Hell proved fruitless.\nWe told the tale of the Servitors in four Plot Point Campaigns, still available and ready to play with just a little tinkering for this edition on our website!\nIn response, the Reckoners have turned their blasphemous gaze back to the grassroots of evil. They've given life to dark desires and horrible abominations that live in the shadows of the isolated frontier, far away from the attention garnered by the overt plans of their Servitors.\nThe heroes of the Weird West join with the secretive Twilight Legion in the distant outposts, chaotic boomtowns, and lonely settlements of the West to fight evil and quell the fear that gives the Reckoners their power.\nSo gather your posse of heroes and hit the trail, from the frozen north to the arid deserts of the Southwest, from the industrial East to the fractured canyons of California's \"Great Maze.\" \nThe Weird West awaits with adventure, mystery, and more monsters than you can shake a Peacemaker at.\nThink these Mojave rattlers look nasty? You should see the rest of it!\nDeadlands is the long-awaited return to Pinnacle's oldest and most popular setting. First published in 1996, the original \"Deadlands Classic\" system won countless awards and its bold, bright orange books are still a striking and valuable addition to gaming shelves the world over. \nFor those who want the whole experience, Deadlands has a rich and varied history to explore!\nDeadlands has told some epic tales since it first burst onto the scene in 1996, but you don't need to be steeped in its storied past to join in the hootin' and hollerin'. If you're an old hand, we think you'll find it both familiar and refreshing.  If you're new to the world or setting, this is the perfect time to join the wagon train (and if you've lapsed, we forgive you for that, partner). We've recapped and summarized the monumental events of the last 24 years so you can catch up.\nThis new edition is the biggest revamp of the game's background and rules since the Reloaded edition from 2005. It's been revised, rewritten, and refocused by both Deadlands Line Editor Matthew Cutter and original creator Shane Hensley.\nBack in the Saddle, by Aaron Riley!\nAll the rules have been updated and adapted to the latest version of the Savage Worlds Adventure Edition. You'll need that book to play. You can add it to your pledge as an Add On if you don't already have it, or you can check out the PDF now.\nArcane Backgrounds are tightened up. Those nasty Harrowed had the same overhaul we gave them in Lost Colony (including letting the Devil out!). There are new and streamlined rules for dueling. And of course a passel of new Edges, gear, infernal devices, and powers to blast the tarnation out of the creepy crawlies coming to do your party in.\nFor you Marshals (that's what we call our Game Masters), there's a comprehensive overview of the Weird West after the events of the Servitor Plot Point Campaigns, including new plots, perils, and intrigue for cowtowns, boomtowns, and old favorites like Lost Angels, Tombstone, Deadwood, Dodge, the City o\u2019 Gloom, and a few new locales we might surprise you with! And of course this handsome tome also includes enough rascals, varmints, and critters to keep a posse busy 'til doomsday.\nThis is more than just a rules update--it's a world update! And check out that gorgeous new graphic design by Karl Keesler, with art by some of the best in the business!\nNow that the tales of the Servitors have been told in their individual Plot Point Campaigns, Deadlands is returning to its roots with more local yarns of dread, terror, and violent action. The new edition and supplements to follow turn their baleful eyes from the world-shaking events of the Reckoning to isolated frontier towns or sinister machinations in the few larger settlements. The Twilight Legion must root out the evil that lurks in all-too-human souls, the lonesome hills nearby, or the dark woods at the edge of town.\nTo showcase the return to more personal tales of horror and adventure, we've created the Horror at Headstone Hill campaign set!\nThe campaign features a single county in Wyoming and the terrors that lurk in a booming mining town and environs. Your heroes roam about the map, interacting with the locals, solving mysteries, fighting abominations, and\u2014with luck and a steady shootin' iron\u2014eventually lower the \"Fear Level.\" That's how you defeat the Reckoners' terrorforming, amigos, and Horror at Headstone Hill showcases it front and center.\nThe Horror at Headstone Hill Campaign Boxed Set!\nThe Deadlands: Horror at Headstone Hill Boxed Set contains an introductory booklet on the region for the players with notes from Tombstone Epitaph reporter Lacy O'Malley and the Twilight Legion, a Marshal's guide detailing all the locations on the map and a full sandbox-oriented Plot Point Campaign, a poster-sized map of the county, and a selection of player handouts to drive this incredible tale of six-guns and sorcery to its bloodstained conclusion!\n Something happened at Devil's Tower recently. Something terrible. A being called the Cackler raised a powerful sorceress of legend, Morgan Le Fay, sending ripples through the many worlds of Deadlands. From the Dark Ages to the far future planet of Banshee in Lost Colony, the \"Morgana Effect\" has caused subtle changes from the world we knew before.\nThe Cackler and his unholy posse ride the range in this world-changing graphic novel by Shane Lacy Hensley!\n The Morgana Effect is a big story that ripples (quietly for now) through all the settings of Deadlands\u2014including the upcoming Deadlands: Dark Ages, the Weird West, Noir, Hell on Earth, and already released Lost Colony. It's also a story-based reason to change the rules and some parts of the setting we've been hankerin' to adjust for a while. You can read more about the latter here, but we think even those of you who have been with us since '96 will welcome the changes once you take 'er for a test ride.\nOver the years we've seen some amazing gaming setups, but collecting and painting a comprehensive collection of cowpokes and critters can be both time consuming and expensive. That's where the Deadlands Pawns come in. \nThe Deadlands Pawns Boxed Set contains over 100 Deadlands characters and critters printed on thick punchboard!\nWe've created a selection of heroes, villains, and monsters in thick punchboard (the sturdy stuff board game tokens are made from) to represent some of the most common and iconic encounters in the Weird West. These figures are even die-cut to the contour of the character image to make each pose as dynamic and striking as possible.\nThe Deadlands Pawns Boxed Set contains 8 sheets of thick punchboard, containing over 100 pawns to bring the Weird West alive on your tabletop. If the set does well, we will expand the line to include additional Deadlands sets and pawn sets for our other lines. \nThat's enough jawin'. Now let's talk about what's really important...what you get for helping us bring the Weird West to life!\nWe've set up the reward tiers to be as simple as possible while still covering the most popular combinations you sidewinders always ask for. We've done 21 of these Kickstarters now, so we have a pretty good handle on things. But if you don't see the particular combination you want, just pledge for the book and add on anything else in the pledge manager we'll launch sometime after the campaign closes.\nRead full details for Retailers in our Savage Retailer newsletter here!\nThe core book for Deadlands: The Weird West is a 192-page hardcover book, in our usual \"graphic novel\" size, and glorious, bloody, full-color throughout. That amazing cover is by Aaron Riley, a fan favorite of the entire Savage Worlds line!\nDeadlands Boxed Set contains the hardcover core rulebook, brand new poster map of the Weird West, GM Screen + Adventure, Set of 25 Bennies, Set of 7 dice, and a set of 12 Archetype Cards, along with Power Cards, Adventure Cards, and Infernal Device Cards\u2014all housed in a sturdy and attractive box to match your Deadlands: Lost Colony Boxed Set!\nThe Deadlands the Weird West Core Boxed Set includes a copy of the hardcover rules as well as a brand new poster map of the Weird West by the phenomenal Cheyenne Wright, a set of 25 Bennies, a set of custom-colored dice and Wild Die, and a Game Master's screen and introductory adventure, Double Down at Sundown, by Rob Wieland!\nWant to see the new screen? Here it is, partner! The tri-fold screen is our usual landscape format with gorgeous art on one side and all the charts and tables the Marshal needs on the other!\nThe new GM Screen for Deadlands: the Weird West! Click here to view Federico Musetti's gorgeous art as a larger image.\nHorror at Headstone Hill Boxed Set contains a Player's Guide booklet, a Marshal's book with a full Plot Point Campaign, a poster map or Uinta County, and several pages of player aids and handouts. Art not final.\nDeadlands Pawns Boxed Set contains 8 sheets of thick punchboard containing stunning full color miniatures die-cut to give you over 100 miniatures for use in your Deadlands games. Art not final.\nAfter the Kickstarter is over you'll be invited to a pledge manager so you can add any additional Pinnacle products you want to your order. Want the Rippers Resurrected Expedition Amazon supplement or Deadlands: Lost Colony or Rifts\u00ae for Savage Worlds Boxed Set? These will all be available to ship with your order.\nIf you want those existing items right now, partner, just head over to www.peginc.com and order, but please realize you'll have to pay shipping on that separately.\nIf you want to order everything at once in the pledge manager (to combine shipping with your Deadlands rewards) everything will be delivered toward the end of 2020. \nAdd-Ons require pledging for a physical reward level. \nAnd if you want to budget or add Deadlands-specific Add-Ons to your Kickstarter pledge now, here are the prices. Thanks as always for your support of our little company!\nWe always like to sweeten the pot. Help us reach our funding goals and we'll add a passel of digital and physical rewards. The first is a set of the cool new Harrowed \"Dominion Cards\" by Cheyenne Wright! If we reach that Stretch Goal, a set of cards will be added to every Deadlands Core Boxed Set. (You can order them as an Add-On as well.)\nWant to hear more from Sounds Like Crowes?

Here's where you can find us on social media:\nDeadlands and Horror at Headstone Hill are both written and in layout. Your help allows us to create all the extras we want to make and get the word out to other fans (by far the hardest challenge for a small company like ours).\nWe plan to deliver the PDF of the core rules a few weeks after the project funds and we get the final backer list from Kickstarter.  This means delivery of the main PDFs about a month after funding and the physical products about 5 months later depending on the printer and shipping, and barring unforeseen mishaps...y'know, like world-wide pandemics and all!\nDigital Rewards\nWe deliver PDF materials through the Pinnacle website and DriveThruRPG.\nPhysical Rewards\nAfter the Kickstarter ends we'll use a pledge manager to collate the physical pledges and allow you the opportunity to include additional Pinnacle products with your pledge. You will pay for shipping after the Kickstarter using the pledge manager. \nClick here to view larger image\nAll prices in USD and based on estimates calculated April 2020.\nCustoms and Taxes for EU, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand\nWe know that international shipping is an expensive part of buying games and we're constantly looking for ways to reduce those costs.\nThe above rates are postage only. Depending on your location, additional VAT/GST will be added to your order in the pledge manager. For example, current VAT for books in the UK is 0%, while Denmark is 25%. After collecting these fees in the pledge manager, our regional partners pay the taxes and file paperwork for you during shipping!\nTo save on international shipping, consider having one of your amigos pledge for your whole posse, then \"Add-On\" additional books to a single package. You should also encourage your local retailer to sign up as a Savage Retailer so they can order directly from us (before it hits regular distribution). Then you can buy the physical product from your favorite local game store, while you pledge at a digital reward level so you don't miss out on the digital Stretch Goals.\nWe Ship Anywhere in the World\nEmail site.admin@peginc.com for an estimate to ship to your location if you don't see it above.  You can also use the handy calculator at USPS.com (most rewards ship in a 12x12x12 inch box).\nDelivery for Merchants\nRead full details for Retailers in our Savage Retailer newsletter here!\nAll retailers located in the contiguous United States receive free shipping.

Kobold Press is wrangling a new horde of wildly original, often lethal, and highly entertaining 5E-compatible monsters to challenge new players and veterans alike.\nThe Tome of Beasts II will bring 400 new monsters to 5th edition, from angelic enforcers, sasquatch and shriekbats, to psychic vampires, zombie dragons, and so much more. All Tome of Beasts II  Kickstarter backers at the $25 level and up can submit an original monster design for possible publication. \nIn addition to the Tome of Beasts II hardcover volume and PDFs, this Kickstarter will fund the creation of monster pawns, VTT versions, monster lairs with beautiful maps, and more!\nWe Kobolds love to make bestiaries and monster books! However, it takes time and funds to create a high-quality, art-heavy, playtest-honed, rules-crunchy volume of 5th edition monsters\u2014and printing a product of this size calls for some financial clout. We're Kickstarting it to make sure we have the funding necessary for a small, medium, large, huge, or even gargantuan print run, as required.\nWith your support, we expect to deliver a big hardcover book, a juicy and useful PDF, and plenty of extras! Thanks to our prior outings with the original Tome of Beasts and the Creature Codex, we have a seasoned team of skilled 5E monster designers and testers, so you can expect even more innovation and fresh ideas to challenge your players, no matter their level.\nThe Tome of Beasts II Lairs book provides quick, one-map encounters with creatures from the Tome of Beasts 2! Playable as standalones, each lair describes a mini-adventure with hazards, terrain maps, adventure hooks, and more to showcase the Kobold Press creatures (and some standard ones too). For a similar book from a prior project, see Creature Codex Lairs. \nThis Kickstarter is focused on doing what we do best: making great monsters. Once that's accomplished, we'll partner with other companies and use their digital expertise to deliver these monsters to you in other formats.\nWe will provide in-depth digital support for this book with Roll20 and Fantasy Grounds.\nThe kobolds are offering both preview and playtest material for those who want it--and skipping that extra layer of material for those who just want it when it is done.\nWhat's the difference between the two?\nA playtest involves running at least one encounter (ideally several) and sending in a short report about the results. Playtesters are acknowledged in the book's credits, and have a real say in the difficulty, balance, and playability of the final creatures. We'll send backers information on how to sign up.\nA preview just means an early look at a few monsters, without providing any formal feedback and without a listing in the credits. No signup or reports required.\nWe're offering a limited edition run of the Tome of Beasts II with a leatherette cover, foil title and spine stamps, ribbon bookmarks, and as much soul-shredding, monstrous style as we can muster--far more than any mere mockup can contain! (Ok, you got us, we have not yet commissioned the cover art for this edition yet.) \nThis edition will be produced to order based on interest; we estimate only 400 to 500 copies will ever be printed. We will not accept pledges for this edition after the Kickstarter ends.\n A handbound leather edition will also be created for TOB2, in an edition of roughly 25 copies. The last TOB handbound book featured a wyvern hide cover; we hope for something equally striking this time around, plus possibly a strap closure or black leather corner treatment.  We will not accept pledges for the handbound edition after the Kickstarter ends. \nPlease allow up to 30 days additional time for the handbound leather edition; the work is performed by a small pair of bookbinder kobolds and they can only create so many volumes per day. \n Here's the short and sweet version of the reward levels.\nThe one item that you might not recognize are the monster pawns, AKA the Tome of Beasts II Pawn Set. These are cardboard standups for use on a battlemat, like the ones we created for Tome of Beasts (see those here) and for Creature Codex. You can see a mockup of what the new ones will look like in the Add-Ons & Extras section.\nWe want to do ALL THE GOODIES, and with your help, we shall have them! First and foremost, we're adding more and more monsters to the book; that's the majority of our stretch goals, and those goals make the hardcover and PDF bigger and better.\nWe ALSO will deliver a set of encounter maps paired with short lairs featuring monsters from the Tome of Beasts II, and several of our goals expand that collection of encounters! Here's our current locked and unlocked goals in all their glory! More will follow once we unlock the current one, of course.\n\nThe kobolds will offer add-ons using BackerKit, a survey sent out after the Kickstarter itself. You can add to your rewards with a Tome of Beasts hardcover or Pocket Edition, extra copies of the Creature Codex or similar items. Please note that add-ons will ship at the same time as the main book, not separately. \nAdding a VTT  License\nAll the TOB2 VTT material is licensed and sold by other companies. However it is easy to add either a Roll20 or a Fantasy Grounds license to any other pledge using the pledge manager during the survey stage.\n Of course, you must provide accurate information about your accounts with them to get the license added to your account.\nAdding a Pawn Set\nFor the Tome of Beasts II Pawn Set, you can add a set to your existing pledge either now or in the survey phase. The MSRP will be $34.99 for 300+ pawns; you save because it is a flat $30 add-on for backers. \nTo Add Now: Go to your pledge for this project and bump the amount by $30. You're all set! Note that this addition may increase the postage required for your pledge (especially if you have a digital-only pledge!)\nTo Add in Survey Phase: Just hang tight until we send out the backer survey. You'll see the full range of add-ons then, including the pawns.\nAny book this size has a lot of hands working on it. Here is a list of the major contributors for TOB2, focusing on those writing dozen of monsters, illustrating scads of them, and pulling it all together. We could double the size of this list, but we're trying to keep it under the Kickstarter page cap.\nWolfgang Baur, Designer and Publisher: The chief kobold will design a dozen monsters, but he also works madly behind the scenes keeping chaos at bay. As publisher, he'll coordinate, budget, and track the project from start to finish.\nDan Dillon, Designer: Known for both deep rules mastery and original, deadly designs, Dan is a veteran of the Kobold text mines who has joined the Wizards of the Coast. He's delivering two special creatures of Shadow.\nDarrin Drader, Designer: A writer whose career has just reached the two decade mark, Darrin loves making new things to enhance your games. He says it was a pleasure to work on this with the Kobolds, and sincerely hopes his contributions harass your players to no end.\nPhillip Larwood, Designer: A long-time Kobold Press stalwart, Larwood excels at aberrations, fiends, and horrors. He brings wild mechanics as well as strong dungeon vibes to his designs.\nJeff Lee, Designer: Blood-stained, infernal, and lurking from lair to lair, Jeff Lee has acquired deep design knowledge of cults, eldritch horrors, and hideous gibbering things at some personal cost. We are delighted he is again gracing us with his dark visions.\nShawn Merwin, Designer: Known for his Adventurer's League work, Merwin also does excellent undead and humanoids of various kinds. He will contribute Lairs as well as monsters.\nKelly Pawlik, Designer: No stranger to supporters of the 5E Warlock Patreon, Kelly Pawlik also designed a large chunk of Empire of the Ghouls and excels at undead and other monstrosities.\nBrian Suskind, Designer: With cinematic flair, Brian Suskind is delivering monsters with Asian roots as well as dungeon horrors and monsters with a twist.\nMike Welham, Designer: Mike is covering a swathe of terrain-based monsters, with a focus on desert, arctic, and dungeon beasts. He's also expert at intriguing drakes and humanoids.\nMarc Radle, Art Director: The maestro who makes all the art trains run on time. (There are art trains, right?)\nBryan Syme, Artist: A Kobold Press regular with a great eye for humans and kobolds. And spiky bits, undead, and much more.\nFlorian Stitz, Artist: A fan favorite for both his cover work and monsters, Florian Stitz excels at giants, humanoids, and creatures in motion.\nRoberto Pitturru, Artist: With a wide range of ability and fluid sketches, as well as exceptional details, Roberto Pitturru is a regular contributor to both Kobold Press monster books and the 5E Warlock Patreon.\nWilliam O'Brien, Artist: A powerhouse artist for Kobold Press, whose talent with monstrous animals and fiends wowed us in Creature Codex. Expect some great monster art here!\nMarcel Mercado, Artist: Familiar from Tome of Beasts, Mercado is back with an eye for great poses, great concepts, and lush armor and glistening hides.\nMeagan Maricle, Editor: Meagan keeps the rest of this crew honest. Keen-eyed and ruthless in defense of clear, sharp, and correct text.\nBen McFarland, Playtest Coordinator: Organizing, shipping, and compiling the data that turns good monsters into great ones. Ben is an unsung hero of Tome of Beasts, and he stepped up for the Creature Codex and Tales of the Old Margreve as well. Someday, a bard will craft a saga of his triumphs.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nKobold Press has shipped over 35 crowdfunded titles since 2006, both small and large, with 14 of them on Kickstarter (this is #15). The Kobolds have won Gold and Silver ENnie Awards for this work, most recently an ENnie for the Creature Codex for 5th Edition in 2019 as Best Monster/Adversary book. The creative team is experienced, and we keep leveling up!\n\nFor Tome of Beasts II, much of the monster design is already done; we worked hard in 2019 designing, compiling, honing, and expanding. The creatures are ready to be further tested and edited. Likewise, we already have the cover and a good deal of interior art commissioned because of our confidence in this book.\n\nThe main challenges are in gathering, developing, and editing the additional monsters text from backers. We'll move ahead on deadline so long as we have a sufficient number of good choices; backer material has exceeded expectations for our prior monster books and we hope for the same this time around!\n\nOther risks include the usual ones: the health of the core team of kobolds (editor, art director, and publisher), as well as business-related risks from tariffs and printer delays. We'll keep you informed on any delays if they arise. \n\nAnd if a lich-king dragoons us all into serving as his minions in a scheme for total world conquest... Well, at least we'll surely be on the winning side?\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Encounters PDF", "descp": "The TOB2 Lairs PDF provides a set of quick encounters, using monsters from TOB2 combined with rich maps.\nINCLUDES:\nTOB2 Lairs PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}], "stat": ["67 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 22 or more", "title": "Encounters Softcover & PDF", "descp": "Get both the softcover TOB2 Lairs book and the PDF for quick encounters!\nSHIPPING NOT INCLUDED.

We may make a future shirt with no back text, but for the Kickstarter, you get the exclusive Tour Shirt.\nAlso available as a $25 add-on in the pledge manager.\nAnd it comes in a red variant!\n Kingdoms, duchies, baronies, earldoms, any territory with people living on it can be your Domain. Domains can be a small province with a single town, or a sprawling kingdom with many cities. This book contains rules for starting with a single province and growing your domain, or starting the game at 1st level by inheriting an entire kingdom!\nThe system assumes that, regardless of how many different domains your campaign world might have, we\u2019re only worried about one Enemy Domain, one Allied Domain, and one Neutral Domain who could go either way. This constrains the number of things the GM needs to worry about so we don\u2019t need a computer to track all the different actors in our play. Of course, an ambitious GM could track more Kingdoms!\nDomain actions allow you to muster new units for your army, develop your land to get more resources out of it, build roads to make it easier to get around for people and armies, spy on your enemies, and ally with your neighbors.\nThe book includes rules and advice for running campaigns where only one player is a regent, all players are regents, or even how to use these rules to track the high-level politics in a game where no players are regents, and you just want the feel of large-scale political powers maneuvering against each other.\nNot every player wants to run a duchy or an earldom, but these rules give you many more kinds of Domains! Existing within, alongside, and sometimes at odds with a Kingdom, are Organizations like Churches, Thieves\u2019 Guilds, Wizard Orders, Bardic Colleges and more. All of them get special Domain Actions that affect the outcome of The Great Game.\nPaladin Order: The Green\nWizard's Order: The Arcanum Camerata\nAssassins College: Nine Silver\nOne player might run a thieves\u2019 guild, but sometimes the entire group wishes they could play a thieves\u2019 guild! Or an order of Monks! But while \u201clet\u2019s all play monks!\u201d sounds cool, once you sit down and think about it you realize that would mean no healing, no tank, no tracker, no one to pick locks or disarm traps or read arcane scrolls unless someone multiclasses, and was not as good at being a monk as everyone else, or played a different class and pretty soon you\u2019re back to playing a normal adventuring partzzzz\u2026..\nMaybe there\u2019s a better way.\nKingdoms and Warfare expands on the rules presented in the Chain of Acheron livestream with Titles for several different organizations.\nTitles give your characters new, limited abilities and proficiencies that let them shore up the deficiencies of a limited-class party.\nA thieves\u2019 guild might have a Godbotherer, a thief who gains proficiency with Religion and limited healing and possibly limited access to prayers. Not as powerful or useful or versatile as a cleric, but it gets the job done.\nAn order of Monks might have an Acolyte of Mystery, who gains proficiency with Arcana and access to limited spells. Or an Acolyte of Stone with increased AC and HP!\nOf course, some titles cannot be conferred during character creation, and must be earned like the Master of Ravens, the Master of Locusts, and the rest of the Monk Masters.\nExpanded rules for Warfare allowing faster, more balanced battles, more and different kinds of units. Pikemen who thwart Cavalry charges! Sappers who undermine fortifications! And more and better rules for Battle Magic; spells that affect units and the entire battlefield.\nNew Maneuvers allow characters to directly command their units, executing daring ploys that can change the course of war!\nNew rules for the Tide of Battle create a connection between the Encounter your characters are fighting and the Battle your units are waging. Doing well in the Encounter gives your army a boost! Doing well in Battle gives your characters an advantage! Of course, doing poorly has similarly predictable results\u2026.\nNew rules for using PCs and monsters as units, as well as more advice for building an army and waging war. The rules for Warfare in Strongholds & Followers are only the beginning of a more robust system.\nStrongholds & Followers  does not require the use of Kingdoms and Warfare; both strongholds and followers give players cool new abilities and allies all by themselves. But combining the two products produces a deeper system for running a world where characters can become Dukes or start their own Church, or run their own Thieves\u2019 Guild.\nWe listened to folks who bought Strongholds & Followers and made sure to put more of what they liked into Kingdoms & Warfare.\nNew Gemstone dragons! New servitors from each of the Courts presented in S&F and three new courts! The Court of Seven Cities (Devils), the Court of Blood (Demons) and the Court of Rot (Undead!) More better things to augment your concordance roll!\nThe monster design from S&F was pretty popular and we\u2019re super excited to do more. \nPLAY\n\nPeople loved the codicies from the first book, so we\u2019re doing more! The Codex Granatine! The Codex Adamant! The Codex Tempestatus! These legendary artifacts will change, or break, your game. Use at your peril!\nIncluding the legendary Codex Bellorum...the BOOK OF WAR.\nAny book of new rules as big as this requires an adventure to show you how to use it. The Regent of Bedegar acts as a sequel to the Siege of Castle Rend and introduces players to Domain Level play. The heroes manage their new domain, putting out fires in Gravesford and other local towns while encountering various organizations in Aendrim, some friendly, some not so much.\nOf course, there will be a battle at the end! Lord Saxton must pay for what he\u2019s done!\nLike Strongholds & Followers, this book uses my setting\u2019s background and lore, so you\u2019ll learn more about the Timescape, the lore of demons, devils, and undead, and more fiction featuring the young adventurers from the first book.\nAnd a Dragon!\nFolks really liked the gemstone dragons from the first kickstarter, so we're doing another one. The Ancient Onyx Dragon Cthrion Uroniziir!\nThis mini is BIG and only available to folks who back this Kickstarter. It will be available as an add-on in our Pledge Manager, but only to folks who pledge!\nIt\u2019s not \u201cCiv.\u201d It doesn\u2019t simulate an elaborate 4X game, it doesn\u2019t worry about stuff like...how much Iron you produce vs how much Wheat you need. Provinces produce \u201cresources.\u201d Alliances just boost those resources.\nIn general these rules focus on high-level play, heavily abstracted, married to crunchy rules that give your characters real mechanical benefits. If you\u2019re looking for a simulation this is not it.\nThe goal is; you\u2019re still playing Fifth Edition, but now your campaign has an extra dimension.\nIf we manage to reach our funding goal, we have a whole bunch of stretch goals planned. The book stays the same, but we unlock new play aids like a GM's Screen and a deck of unique unit cards for your fantasy warfare needs. \n The MCDM Screen\nA 4-panel screen for the discerning game master to fudge die rolls behind. Without a screen, you\u2019re just another random person at the table. With the screen, you become THE MASTER!\nOur screen gives you easy access to tables from Strongholds, Followers, Kingdoms, and Warfare including the list of Domain Actions, Random Domain Events, as well as the full list of actions that adjust your Concordance, making it easier to track.\nThe Unit Deck\nDozens of unique units with custom special abilities to use in your epic battles! Centaur shock troops! Goblin sappers! Beholder units! Dragon units! All printed on high-quality cards ready to be used immediately at your table.\n Dope Minis\nWe have a bunch of new monsters planned for Kingdoms & Warfare and we'd love to make minis out of all of them! Each stretch goal pays for the 3D model and the manufacturing mold. As we unlock new ones...IF we unlock new ones...you'll get to see the art and lore and how big the mini will be an how much it will cost. You'll be able to upgrade your pledge in our pledge manager to add any of the minis you like to your pledge.\nCheck back to see what (if anything!) gets unlocked!\n\nWe\u2019ll charge for shipping after the Kickstarter is over. We will collect this in the pledge manager.\nWe\u2019ll ship your rewards from one of the four Blackbox warehouses we work with. This project is US, Canada, and Australia friendly. Under current trade agreements, we are EU friendly. This may change pending future Brexit negotiations.\nBelow is a list of estimated shipping costs for the K&W Hardcover, PDF + Sticker pledge. Keep in mind that these are estimates and that the accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager according to your address, pledge level, and potential add-ons.\nWe don\u2019t ship to the following countries:\nAfghanistan, Brazil, Congo, Cote d\u2019Ivoire (Ivory Coast), Cuba, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Guam, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Liberia, Libya, Myanmar (Burma), North Korea, Russia, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine :(", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are many fewer risks associated with this product compared to Strongholds & Followers. We no longer print our books in China, so there\u2019s no danger of tariffs or trade interfering with our production. We have been through the Import Duty gauntlet so we have all the paperwork you need to ship your product around the world. We have good partners now, we know great artists, we have a great relationship with Trenchworx the folks who make our minis. \n\nLike Strongholds & Followers, these rules are based on rules I\u2019ve already designed before, so we\u2019re not creating an entire ruleset from whole cloth.\n\nI think probably the biggest risk is the fact that all of this revolves around me and my writing and design. Something happens to me, there could be a delay. But one of our goals with this project and the Player\u2019s Guide To Capital is finding other freelance writers and designers to work with under my direction so the product isn\u2019t wholly reliant on my labor.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Kingdoms & Warfare PDF", "descp": "Kingdoms & Warfare in an indexed, searchable PDF.

In PunkApocalyptic: The Roleplaying Game, based on the wild and irreverent miniatures game of the same name by Bad Roll Games, you and your friends assume the roles of mercenaries who roam the Wasteland. In this bleak and radioactive land, you fight to survive, explore the ruins of what came before, and trade blood, sweat, and tears for the precious bullets that have become the land's currency. Explore the radioactive ruins, fight battle-crazed mutants, negotiate with bizarre cultists, bargain with junkers and scavengers, and unearth fantastic relics from the past. Brutal and filthy, PunkApocalyptic: The RPG offers thrilling adventures steeped in the carnage of a bleak and devastated future.    \n\n As a huge thank you to everyone who has supported so far, all backers of Scavenger and higher get FOUR bonus missions!     \nArt by Matteo Spirito\nPunkApocalyptic: The RPG uses a variant of the Demon Lord Engine, introduced first in the horror-fantasy roleplaying game, Shadow of the Demon Lord. Designed for a short-burst campaign of eleven adventures, with flexible character development, and no-nonsense, streamlined rules, you can bang out a character in no time and get down to the business of kicking ass.\nYou start the game as a fragile survivor, choosing from a list of eight backgrounds such as Muscle or Face. Once you complete your first mission, you assemble a team, and choose a novice path to guide your character's development. Novice paths include the mutated freaks, killers, and scum. The more missions you complete, the more choices you make, picking up an expert path and eventually a master path.\nPunkApocalyptic: The RPG includes some variations on the Demon Lord Engine, such as using eight attributes instead of four, with Grit as a healing resource, along with a few other changes. If you know how to play Shadow of the Demon Lord, you'll have no trouble playing this game. And if you don't yet know Shadow of the Demon Lord, well, it's easy, using familiar dice rolling conventions to make it easier for folks familiar with some of the other well-known roleplaying games currently being played today. \nArt by Matteo Spirito; This could be you!\nWant to learn more?

Perched on his massive throne, the Sea King dreams of his massive jaws bathing in runnels of fresh land-dweller blood. He dreams of the ecstasy of rending air-breather flesh. His hate-filled dreams suffuse him with visions of presiding over a glorious and bloody feast where his despised enemies, those both above and below the waves, drown in a tide of their own blood, torn apart by his fierce warriors. In this sprawling adventure the characters will come face to face with this terrible menace.\nSea King\u2019s Malice is a full color and lavishly illustrated 5e adventure for the world\u2019s most popular role-playing game that takes characters on a sweeping adventure across the ocean, to previously uncharted lands, and finally down under the waves to the very depths of the sea. It is also available for the 0E Swords & Wizardry system for those preferring old-school rulesets.\nOn the East Coast of the Crescent Sea sits the vital city of Bridgeport, where the merchant company of Zephyr Assimilated has mysteriously lost a ship. Not just any ship, either, but  their flagship, a well-outfitted, well-provisioned merchant vessel with a veteran captain \u2014 who also happens to be the eldest child of Zephyr Assimilated\u2019s owner, Jaxon Brand.\nBrand is now assembling an expedition to search for and rescue the lost ship... \nOnly the most stalwart and bravest of heroes will have any chance of surviving the hazards of the open sea and the perils of other strange and yet unknown lands, both above and below the waves, as they search for clues surrounding the disappearance of the missing ship.  For in the sea-green depths a brooding menace awaits them, filled with  inhuman hatred of all things of the surface world. The adventurers\u2019 journey will end, one way or the other, in the Court of the terrifying Sea King. This edge-of-your seat 5e adventure takes characters to level 10, and is also available for Swords & Wizardry (0e) The Swords & Wizardry version will begin at higher level and cover fewer level advancements.\n\n Do you have the courage, fortitude, and lack of self-preservation to challenge the terror of the seas \u2013 the terrible and brooding menace of the Sea King? Surely only the foolhardy or the truly desperate would actually seek out this horror in the abyssal depths and confront him in his court, his very seat of power!  For the sea is an unforgiving place, the natural realm of the Sea King, and the characters are merely intruders in his realm. And yet \u2026 perhaps they will turn out to be very deadly intruders indeed\u2026 \n\nThe Treasure from Beadle & Grimm's Pandemonium Warehouse.\nFrog God Games is very proud to announce our partnership with Beadle & Grimm\u2019s Pandemonium Warehouse. They are the premier creator of high-end tools for tabletop game masters and players worldwide. The Map Vault: Sea King's Malice is the first of a planned series of limited edition maps for gamers everywhere.\nDear friends,\nAs grizzled veterans of the original AD&D, Alex\u2019s tale of the Sea King really spoke to us here at Beadle & Grimm\u2019s. The rules may be 5th Edition, but the vibe is old school in the best possible way \u2013 it strikes the perfect balance between heady role-playing, tense dungeon-crawling  and visceral, gory combat. We\u2019ve been looking for an opportunity to try something new, so we\u2019re very grateful to Alex and Frog God for inviting us to create a special enhancement for the Sea King\u2019s Malice adventure \u2013 our first-ever selection from the B&G Map Vault.\n\nThe Sea King\u2019s Edition of the Map Vault focuses on one of the most exciting and unique elements of Alex\u2019s story \u2013 the sailing ships. Three different ships are presented here, each on its own two-sided 24x30 map with art created exclusively for Beadle & Grimm\u2019s. One side has the full-color detail of a ship from the adventure, while the other has blank interiors and a dry erase surface so that you, the Dungeon Master, can use it to create future adventures from your own imagination. All six battle maps are scaled and gridded for your minis, and they come rolled in a custom cartographer\u2019s tube to keep them protected for years of future use.\nPrototype of the Map Vault: Sea King's Malice Cartographer's case.\nBeadle & Grimm\u2019s Pandemonium Warehouse was founded in 2018 by five old friends with more decades of gaming between them than they\u2019d like to admit. Our first two products, the Platinum Edition of Waterdeep: Dragon Heist and the Sinister Silver Edition of Ghosts of Saltmarsh, have established us as a premier creator of high-end tools for Dungeon Masters. Now with our new Map Vault, we get to reach out to the vibrant extended community of 5th Edition gamers.\nOne last thing \u2013 like our Platinum boxes, the Sea King\u2019s maps are a limited edition only \u2013 once they\u2019re sold out, they\u2019re gone forever. So jump on board!\nAnchors aweigh!\nSet sail!\n(Seriously, we can keep this up all day. Don\u2019t tempt us.)\nSincerely,\nBill, Charlie, Jon, Matt and Paul\nThese items may be added to any pledge in any quantity.

First of all: All shipping costs are included with this pledge level.The Temple of the Shark God Pledge gets you an invite you to join the Froggies at North Texas RPG Con 2020 in June or at Gamehole Con in November 2019 (your choice of 1). At this event, we will pay for your:\nConvention badge \nHotel room \nMeals and beverages\nAll you pay is your transportation to and from the convention! Shipping is also FREE, anywhere in the world! This is where you get to hang out with us behind the scenes, eat dinners with us, play in our games during the day, and generally stay up late without your parents telling you that it's bedtime. Ask any of our fans that have bought this pledge before, it\u2019s truly a wonderful experience! This reward also includes automatic entry into a game game run by Alex Kammer at North Texas RPG Con or at Gamehole Con in 2019 or 2020! Plus a VIP invitation to Bill Webb's Tegel Manor Halloween Game at Gamehole Con (2019 Only)!\nBook Quality\nAll Frog God Games hardcovers are stitched into 16-page packets, the packets are sewn together, and then all the packets are sewn to a cloth backing, creating a book block that is glued to its cover. This is what we mean when we say \"library binding.\"  That being said, after a myriad of book-binding issues both recently and dating back to 2nd Edition, there is nothing we hate to see more than someone investing in an expensive game book and having it fall apart on them after only a short period of regular use.  After all, you guys spend a lot of money on your books! Second, if a Frog God hardcover book ever falls apart (we have tested this with baseball bats and very rough use, by the way), we will replace it at no cost assuming we still have one in stock. Yes, that means if you call me in ten years, and your book binding has failed you (failed us really) through regular use (please no bulldozer roll overs), just email me and if the book is still in stock, we will mail you a new copy for free. Nothing I can do for you if they are all sold out though (but email me anyway and I'll hook you up in some way).  PLEASE NOTE! The POD option for this books is a softcover book and is NOT library bound. That being said, it is significantly less expensive to ship if you live in the UK, EU or Australia.\nBackerKit\nBackerkit enables us to get you the rewards you want both faster and more reliably than we could otherwise. No reward is eligible for shipment without Backerkit checkout. You will be asked to create a Backerkit account to select your reward. This process verifies both reward selection and your correct shipping address. PLEASE complete the Backerkit process in a timely fashion so we can deliver your pledge reward! \nDigital Reward Shipping\nWe will email the instructions to groups of eligible backers with instructions on how to access PDF pledge rewards. This is a three-step process that is completed using our web store. You will have to create a customer account on the Frog God Games website to get your PDF; it's how we keep track of everything. The Kickstarter PDF files are 'purchased' at zero cost by backers (as they are paid for after the Kickstarter) at the Frog God Games web store using a coupon code. That code will be sent via email to backers or will be provided through BackerKit. This process gets you your correct reward, ensures your future access to your reward files, and allows us to track project fulfillment. If you are missing something from your account, and see all over Facebook that everyone else has it, please email Mike at mike@froggodgames.com, and he will set things right for you. Be patient for a few days after it is first released though, as we do release these in batches to prevent crashing our server.\nPhysical Reward Shipping\nWhen the BackerKit site for this project is ready, you will receive an email. This is a separate communication than the Kickstarter survey. In that email you will receive the link to the site where you will be asked to verify your shipping information, your pledge rewards, and checkout through their system. Your Kickstarter pledge amount does not include shipping. It is during BackerKit checkout that your shipping cost is calculated and charged.\nShipping Damage or other Related Issues\nNo matter what we do, the post office seems to have a desire to drop, kick, throw or even drive over some packages with trucks (yes, it has happened). In the unlikely event that you are one of the lucky folks that have this happen to you, we will of course send you a new book. All you need to do is send photos of the damage in an email to Mike at mike@froggodgames.com. He will set you up with a new book. Please do not send multiple emails to multiple sources as it confuses the process and may cause delay. That being said, we have a 100% delivery promise on our books. You are the reason we are able to make cool products, and your satisfaction matters to us.\nRefunds\nIf for some reason you need a refund post-Kickstarter, we are happy to oblige, less a 13% charge that we pay to Kickstarter, Backerkit and Paypal. \nOverseas Shipping\nThis hardcover book likely will cost around $60 to $80 to ship to non-US customers. We continue to see cost increases and damage increases on overseas shipping. We cannot do anything about this. Likewise, some countries charge VAT tax or other fees to our customers on receipt. We cannot fraudulently lie about the value of materials we mail out.We actually have considered not even selling books overseas due to the complaints about postage. That being said, we have a number of long term customers that we want to be able to get our stuff. But this postage stuff is not for the faint of heart. Due to the handling of our products when we mail them tens of thousands of miles, we have noted a significant increase in damage as well. One package sent overseas can cost $50, $70 or even $100 to reship. We discussed this internally, after spending several thousand dollars in excess postage over the past year. While we take great care in packing, we still have about 2% of our shipments get damaged en-route. What we decided was that we would start double boxing overseas shipments, and also that we needed to charge insurance costs on the postal service. We will continue to honor our policy of 100% resend on damaged books--and after much deliberation, we will be adding a $15 USD insurance and handling charge on all overseas shipments. T We hate to do this--but conditions have simply become untenable for us to continue to lose large amounts of money shipping books overseas. We are happy to ship you anything regardless of where you live, but we have to stay in business at the same time.

Inside you'll find new allies, armaments, and abilities to aid Tomorrow Legionnaires in their fight against the evils of the Megaverse\u00ae.\n Arcana & Mysticism:  Explores the Federation of Magic, Psyscape, and Techno-Wizard enclaves throughout North America, and the dire threats hiding within. \n Blood & Banes: Details the struggle of dark heroes against the alien Xiticix Hivelands, encroaching Vampire Kingdoms, mysterious Dinosaur Swamp, and insanity of Madhaven. \n Empires of Humanity:  Brings to life the wonders of human civilization from the Coalition States to the New West, and uncovers the secrets of the east coast.\nAll three books are 192 pages, hardback, and full-color throughout!\nPrevious Rifts\u00ae backers also get updated core PDFs automatically...see below!\nThese three, brand new 192-page books use the latest version of the rules found in the Savage Worlds Adventure Edition! \nPrevious Rifts\u00ae for Savage Worlds Backers\nBest of all, not only can you get these three NEW Worldbooks for Rifts\u00ae, we're printing revised and updated versions of the original core Rifts\u00ae for Savage Worlds books (The Tomorrow Legion Player's Guide, Game Master's Handbook, and Savage Foes of North America) and making it easy for you to upgrade as well!\nThese deals are only available during this Kickstarter and pledge manager (as reward levels). After that individual book titles will be listed at their full retail price.\nHere's what we're doing to help everyone upgrade to the latest version of the rules:\n1) Previous PDFs of the three core Savage Rifts\u00ae books, whether purchased through Kickstarter, DriveThru, or our site, will be updated automatically. (If you want to keep the older files, save them off and rename them, or contact us at site.admin at peginc.com.)\n2) Print copies (now all in hardback) are bundled below at the lowest price we ever plan to offer them. Once the Kickstarter and pledge manager are closed, they'll be listed at their full retail price.\n3) Our primary Stretch Goal is The Tomorrow Legion Field Guide. Within, we'll be updating original Savage Rifts\u00ae supplements AND adding new material as well (see Stretch Goals, below). Every backer at the Digital Core level and above gets this collected PDF for FREE. It will be available for general sale to others afterwards, and since we hit the Stretch Goal it will be given to every physical backer in print too!\nAny Questions? Email Pinnacle customer service at site.admin@peginc.com\nJust Want Individual Books?\nIndividual titles will be available as Add-Ons to physical reward levels in the pledge manager after the campaign ends. You may also pledge at a digital reward level and upgrade to a physical reward level in the pledge manager. These books will be priced at their regular retail prices, however. If you want the best deal, the reward tiers listed above offer the best savings.\nIf you only want one of the books in this line, we recommend you preorder from a retailer and pledge here for a digital reward level. You may also wait to order from the PEGinc.com website after the pledge manager closes. \nAny Questions? Email Pinnacle customer service at site.admin@peginc.com\nThe three new Worldbooks allow you to extend the Tomorrow Legion's adventures beyond the locales presented in the Tomorrow Legion Player's Guide, Game Master's Handbook, Savage Foes of North America, GM Screen, and Garnet Town Gambit adventure.\nThese books are compatible with the new Adventure Edition of the Savage Worlds  core rules and contain...\nThree new epic Plot Point Campaigns\nOver a dozen new stand-alone Savage Tales\nGazetteers covering every major settlement in North America\nOver two dozen new heroic archetypes to play\nAnd hordes of new foes!\n\nRifts\u00ae North America: Blood & Banes\nWhere darkness looms, the light shines brightest!\nThough the Coalition States and the True Federation of Magic threaten the Tomorrow Legion from either side, the greatest dangers to Castle Refuge come from far afield. In the south, the Vampire Kingdoms plot. In the east, mutant tribes stalk Dinosaur Swamp and ghost-haunted Madhaven. In the north, the alien Xiticix and the demonic Kingdom of Monsters threaten all life on Rifts\u00ae Earth!\nExtensive faction descriptions, new Savage Tales, and over 40 new creatures help Game Masters bring these other new threats to life, while the Plot Point Campaign Into the Desert Night plunges the Legionnaires into a deadly duel with the Vampire Kingdoms!\nHope blooms anew!\nRifts\u00ae North America: Blood & Banes contains options for players to bring new allies to life as auxiliary Legionnaires. Reid\u2019s Rangers, the Knights of the White Rose, the Deathbringer Tribe, and the Tundra Rangers stand ready to fight against these banes.\nInside you will find new Iconic Frameworks such as the ethical Necromancer and Secondary Vampire, M.A.R.S. packages like the Barbarian and Dinosaur Hunter, new races including the Centaur and Werecat, and plenty of gear and vehicles to help your heroes take the fight to the worst North America offers.\nRifts\u00ae North America: Arcana & Mysticism\nTranscend your limits!\nAll Legionnaires know of the vile Federation of Magic and its vendetta against the Coalition States, but few comprehend the eldritch powers found further abroad\u2026\nWhat do your Legionnaires know of the Spirit West\u2014the Techno-Wizards of Arzno, the Native American Preserves, or the glory of Tryth-Sal? What do they understand of Lazlo and the territories it defends? What do they truly know about the political machinations splitting the Magic Zone apart?\nUnleash your power.\nRifts\u00ae North America: Arcana & Mysticism gives players the tools to dive deep into the magical side of Rifts\u00ae. New Iconic Frameworks and M.A.R.S. Packages\u2014such as the Dragon Juicer, Psi-Warrior, and Zapper\u2014and new gear and vehicles\u2014like the Arzno Jackrabbit and the Dweomer Colossus\u2014provide players access to new realms of mystical might.\nFor Game Masters, new Savage Tales and over 30 new creatures flesh out the threats found in these far-flung magical realms. The Plot Point Campaign Souls of Darkness integrates mysterious Psyscape into Castle Refuge\u2019s alliances and rivalries. This epic adventure reshapes the Tomorrow Legion\u2019s role on Rifts\u00ae Earth!\nRifts\u00ae North America: Empires of Humanity\nFight for the future of humanity!\nThe Rifts\u00ae shattered the golden age of technology.\nThe Coalition\u2019s Emperor prosecutes his Crusade for Humanity\u2014seeking to absorb non-arcane human societies and purge all others\u2014encroaching on both the Tomorrow Legion\u2019s potential allies and enemies, accelerating the pace of events set in motion by the Fall of Tolkeen. Corporate states, despotisms, and wild barter towns all employ unbelievably high-tech might.\nThreats such as the Coalition States, Free Quebec, and Pecos Empire abound as do potential allies in places like the New West, Great Lakes Kingdoms, and Texas Free Lands; then there are the enigmatic forces of Archie Three, the Shemarrian Nation, and the Republicans to contend with.\nNow humanity strikes back!\nRifts\u00ae North America: Empires of Humanity shines the spotlight on the sci-fi aspects of Rifts\u00ae. New Mutant Animal races expand beyond Dog Boys while a new Iconic Framework allows players to design their own robot characters from scratch. Treatment Edges offer state-of-the-art possibilities for Juicers while expanded Combat and Professional Edges give gunfighters and mercenaries their day in the sun.\nExtensive new gear options and rules\u2014for power armor, vehicles, guns, explosives, cybernetics, bots, and more\u2014give players and Game Masters more toys than they can handle. The intrigue-laden Plot Point Campaign Ex Machina reveals the hidden history of the Great Cataclysm to the players, while new Savage Tales and over 20 new foes give Game Masters more technological threats to unleash on the Tomorrow Legion.\n Any Questions? Email Pinnacle customer service at site.admin@peginc.com\nWe love Rifts\u00ae here at Pinnacle, and hope to continue exploring the Megaverse\u00ae for many years to come. With YOUR continued support and enthusiasm, future Worldbooks will allow the heroes of Rifts\u00ae Earth to explore the returned dark continent of Atlantis, the Thousand Islands of sundered South America, the high-tech New German Republic besieged on all sides by demonic armies, and the mysteries of the Millennium Druids and New Camelot of the British Isles!\nCovers courtesy of Palladium Books, Inc.

After every campaign, we get a ton of emails from people who didn't know it was happening, so we greatly appreciate your help spreading the word!\n As with the original Rifts\u00ae for Savage Worlds Kickstarter, the Stretch Goals we unlock will be additional material in PDF form, compiled together to form The Tomorrow Legion Field Manual. This collection will be provided free to all backers who pledge at the Digital Core level or higher. Some of this material will be new versions of existing PDFs, revised and updated for the new edition of Savage Worlds, and some will be all-new information and adventures created specifically for this campaign. \n\n\nSocial Media Goals\nHelp us spread the word to Rifters far and wide. In return, we'll unlock additional Social Media Goals: like bonus stretch goals but unlocked by activity on social media. The more we spread the word, the more goals we unlock.\nEvery share and reaction moves toward the next Social Media Goal. Please help us reach as many Rifts\u00ae players as possible by following us on Twitter and/or Facebook and boost the signal.\nNote: Add-Ons may incur additional shipping. Only physical reward backers may pledge for Add-Ons. Shipping will be collected after the Kickstarter during the survey (see below).\nThe pledge manager survey is sent after the Kickstarter ends. You may either pledge for Add-On items *now* or during the *survey*. There is no preference given to those who pledge during the Kickstarter on limited items. You will need to watch your email for Kickstarter Updates to know when the pledge manager survey is sent.\nTo Add-On items now, click on the pledge level you want. It should show you the total reward level. Add funds equal to the Add-On item price to your total pledge. There is no special button or function for this--Add-Ons are not part of the Kickstarter website software. Just a tradition. :)\nPlease note you may be charged additional shipping for those Add-On items during the pledge manager (it's the same shipping price whether you Add-On now or later). You will likely pay *something* during the pledge manager\u2014even if you Add-On the shipping estimates shown below\u2014or be left with a credit which cannot be refunded or used. While we appreciate that you want to pay for everything now, it's really best to wait until the pledge manager to pay for shipping. \nTo Add-On items during the survey, do nothing now. When we open the pledge manager, you can choose what Add-Ons you want and your total including shipping will be calculated for you.  You will pay via credit card.\nIf you have any questions, email site.admin@peginc.com.\nAdd-On items will include...\nRevised and Updated Core Books\nSince the original Rifts\u00ae for Savage Worlds Kickstarter, we have revised and updated the core Savage Worlds rules with the Adventure Edition. We took the opportunity to clean up and update the three books from the original Kickstarter and provide them as optional add-ons for this campaign.\nThese books are revised to bring them into line with the new Savage Worlds Adventure Edition rules. We will be providing a conversion guide that covers the changes and additions, but if you prefer to have the latest version, you can add the books to your pledge. \nLimited Kickstarter Exclusive Offer\nFor the duration of this Kickstarter campaign only, we are offering substantial savings on both the new and revised books. Once the Kickstarter ends, these books will again be returned to their regular prices. \nThe new Worldbooks will retail at $39.99 each, or $20 each in pdf format.

SINGLE. MONTH. In fact...\nIt's not a \"magazine\"... it's a monthly expansion BOOK!\nIf you never experience the old RPG mags, they were more than just a collection of articles. The old magazines were expansion sets and rules supplements and they were PACKED with content.\nEach issue is like getting a NEW jam-packed full-sized Fifth Edition supplement in the mail.\n Full-length adventures. Never run out of campaign material with playtested, full-length adventures for all levels.\n Sub-classes. Add variety to your game with brand new sub-classes for all class levels.\n Monsters. Need more challenges? Look no further than brand new monsters with full stats and ecological notes.\n Spells, Magic Items, Rules Supplement and more! There's so much content that all of it could exist in a book by itself.\nDigital mockup of what the first issue will look like.\nEach dynamic issue of BroadSword Magazine includes four NEW and ORIGINAL Fifth-Edition compatible adventures, plus new monsters, races, subclasses, magic items, and more every month in both print and digital PDF formats.\nBroadsword operates under the Fifth Edition Open License Agreement, meaning that the game is FULLY compatible with modern Fifth Edition rules of \"the world's most popular roleplaying game.\"\nSo expect to see plenty of ancient dragons while you're exploring lots of dungeons!\nHere is the tentative table of contents for BroadSword magazine #1.\nAdventures \nThe Secret of Forsaken Peak Cross Section\nFeature - The Secret of Forsaken Peak Part 1 (The Goblin Mine) by Dave Hamrick and Justin David Russell. The goblins of Forsaken Peak have been acting up lately. You're tasked by your patron (five different options with five different goals) to investigate what they're up to. This is the first part of The Secret of Forsaken Peak megadelve adventure path, set for a group of 5th-level characters.\nBonus - The Secret of Forsaken Peak Castle of Chaos Detail by Dave Hamrick and Justin David Russell. Need a place for your characters to rest in between delves? The Castle of Chaos is the perfect spot. Well, if you ignore the fact that it's managed by a bunch of insane people, that is.\nThe Battle of Dragard Mine by Dave Hamrick and Justin David Russell. The residents of Dragard Mine discovered something important in the old mountain. Whatever it is, the Beastmen of Kalibar want to get their claws on it.  Dragard Mine is an adventure for a group of 11th-level characters and uses Dave Hamrick's original mass combat rules system.\nComes with a double-sided fold out map of Dragard Mine.\nEvadimus's School for Gifted Spellcasters by Dave Hamrick and Justin David Russell. How do wizards learn their first spells? At wizardry school, of course! One of the most famous of these schools is Evadimus' School for Gifted Spellcasters. This adventure is for 0-level characters that takes wizards-to-be from commoner to 1st-level caster over the course of a school year.\nTrial of Heroes by Dave Hamrick. Every year, the lords of South Castle come together to test adventurers all over the land; not for their sheer might and power, but for their ability to think and work as a team. The Trial of Heroes follows the tradition of RPG magazines of offering up level-agnostic challenges for characters of any level.\nOne-Shot Adventure by Dave Hamrick. A one-shot adventure in the vein of the old \"Side Treks\" articles that'll work as a nice little side quest. Theme and plot too-be-determined, although it will be centered around 2nd-level characters.\nArticles\nHow to Keep Your Players Engaged by Dave Hamrick. You know the situation: you're explaining an awesome landscape or a tense battle and for whatever reason you can't seem to get your players' attention. Either they're looking at their phones, chatting it up, or just off in la-la-land. Dave Hamrick explains how he keeps his characters engaged in his games and shares some tips on how you can get your players engaged, too.\nRules Supplements\n10 New Cantrips by Dave Hamrick. Everyone has that one or two favorite cantrip that they love to use frequently. But in the end, there isn't a whole lot of variety when it comes to cantrip. Dave Hamrick offers up 10 more cantrips for characters to use.\nMass Combat Basics by Dave Hamrick. To accompany the Battle of Draggard Mine adventure, Dave Hamrick's crafted a full set of easy-to-use mass combat rules that capture the feel of Fifth Edition and lets characters be heroes on wider level.\nNew Playable Race: Laicosts (Mousefolk) by Dave Hamrick. A DMDave classic, laicosts are scallywag mouselike humanoids that stay in tight knit communities. The article will expand on their world and introduce the playable mousefolk.\nTraps & Puzzles Featurette by Dave Hamrick. Need some non-combat challenges for your dungeon encounters? The Traps & Puzzles featurette helps you do just that. \n3 New Arcane Subclasses by Dave Hamrick. The first stretch goal hit for the project was opening up three new subclasses. These subclasses are Wizard Teacher Arcane Tradition, Madness Sorcererous Origin, and Warlock Patron of Forbidden Lore.\n2 New Subclasses by Dave Hamrick. Another stretch goal opened up two new subclasses. These are as-of-yet undetermined, but will probably be related to Forsaken Peak.\n3 Mass Combat Feats by Dave Hamrick. The second stretch goal hit opens up new feats for mass combat campaigns. These will coincide with the mass combat rules.\nMonsters by Jack by Jack Hamrick & TBD. My son Jack draws a monster and artists bring it to life.\n7 New Uncommon Magic Items by Dave Hamrick. This was a bonus stretch goal--I'll be creating 7 uncommon magic items for you to put into your campaign.\n10 New Monsters by Dave Hamrick. More monsters! Already, I have a library of hundreds of monsters on DMDave. What's 10 more?\nRandom Wilderness Tables by Dave Hamrick. Need some ideas for wilderness dressing? This chart of 100 random wilderness encounter will help spice up your adventures.\nDouble-Sided Poster by Justin David Russell. The front cover art and the map for Dragard Mine will be featured on this amazing, high-quality double-sided poster.\nAnd more...\nWith each stretch goal, more content will be added to this already-awesome list. Keep an eye out here on the Kickstarter page as well as communications to see what's coming down the pipe for the first issue of BroadSword Magazine. \nThe best part? The first adventure is already penned and ready to go and the other three adventures are in final draft stages. You can read the original draft on DMDave's website.\nThe Goblin Mine, the first part of The Secret of Forsaken Peak.\nThat means that as soon as you sign on to this Kickstarter, you can get a digital copy of the first adventure, The Secret of Forsaken Peak: The Goblin Mine by Dave Hamrick and Justin David Russell. It's the first part of a HUGE megadelve adventure path that will be included in the magazine.\nWe're nuts for the classic RPG 'zines of the '80s and '90s. \nHowever,  it costs quite a bit to create a high-quality magazine, thick with original art and solid, playtested rules, all compatible with 5th edition. \nPrinting a magazine like this takes some serious capital. That's why we're Kickstarting it. We want to make sure we have the funding necessary for print runs tiny to gargantuan.\nAnd we don't want to cheapen it. While the magazine will intentionally have an old-school-vibe to it (black-and-white interior, pen/ink illustrations, etc.) it will still be printed on the highest quality paper available with perfect binding. \n\"So what's up with BroadSword magazine beyond the first issue? And why should I be excited about it (aka, why should I pay for 12-months of issues?)\"\nGreat question! Here's what you should look forward to with the magazine:\n1) Issues #2 - #6 are already mostly planned out. While we've still got a few nitty gritty details to plan on, here is the \"themes\" for the issues following #1:\n Issue #2 - Horror. To coincide with Halloween, BroadSword will have adventures, articles, and supplements geared around horror stories and monsters.\n Issue #3 - Science fiction. New rules for science fiction along with an accompanying adventure.\n Issue #4 - Winter. Winter based adventures, holidays, and more.\n Issue #5 - Downtime+. Downtime is a cool feature of Fifth Edition, but kinda falls apart at higher levels. The adventures and articles in this issue will address this problem.\n Issue #6 - Gear. Looking for cool, new items for your characters or NPCs? This issue will feature cool weapons, magic items, and more and adventures to compliment them.\n2) We're taking submissions for issues #2 and up. As much as I love creating content, to ensure that we can work on a tight schedule, we will be taking submissions from other creators in the community. This includes artists, adventure-crafted, article-writers, and even homebrewers. And we're paying for the content!\n3) DMDave has 500,000+ words worth of content to fall back on. Worst case scenario (somehow, no one on earth submits anything), we still have 7 months worth of content to fall back on with DMDave.com. That's nearly 600 articles and 500,000+ words worth of original Fifth Edition content.\n4) Multiple Printer Sources. We have three different printers ready to go (include, two of which are associated directly with the business) to print issues in advance. There will be no logistical snafus to slow down printing. And even if there are, we'll be sure to communicate.\n5) Total transparency. Subscribers of the magazine will have full transparency of all the forthcoming content. You'll be able to see what's going on and even offer input either on DMDave.com, our social media accounts, the official BroadSword discord channel and more.\n6) Experience & Research. I have been in ecommerce for nearly a decade. In addition to experience serving customers online, I have done plenty of research and worked closely with other publishers to ensure that any issue that could come up is addressed ahead of time.\nWe're 100% invested in this project and want to make sure that it succeeds.  \nNow it wouldn't be a fun Kickstarter if we didn't have a whole mess of Stretch Goals to offer, too, now would it?\nHere is what you can expect to get along with the magazine should we match these goals: \nMore to come!\nWe know that not everyone is a \"grognard\" like JD and I. That's why this book is not only available in Print format, but Digital format (PDF) as well.\nAs we noted above, the adventure is already completed and ready as both a FREE \"blog\" version which you can read now and a \"preview\" version which you'll receive after the Kickstarter ends. However, the finalized PDF for the magazine will have all new art, get a thorough playtesting analysis, and come with a lot more bonus content. \nPlus we'll partner with other companies and use their experience in digital production to make sure that the finished products are 100% perfecto.\nOne of the most exciting things about BroadSword magazine is that it features the outstanding art of world-class old-school artist Justin David Russell (Epic Werkes Studio). JD is a traditional illustrator, using pen/ink and oil paints to make his creations. \nCheck out some of his art below:\nThe cover art to BroadSword #1/The Secret of Forsaken Peak\nDid I mention that there might be some DRAGONS in DUNGEONS? ;)\n\"Sorry, laddie, but yeh won't be a-tossin' THIS dwarf!\"\nA recent image by JDR, a warrior stumbles upon something... scaly.\nWhat's this pigman? That's how JDR draws goblins!\nThis time, we're offering both preview and playtest material for those who want to try the content out before its official launch.\n What's the difference between the two? \nA playtest involves running at least one of the adventures. Playtesters are acknowledged in the magazine's credits, and have a real say in the difficulty, balance, and playability of the final creation. We'll send backers information on how to sign up.\nA preview just means an early look, without providing any formal feedback and without a listing in the credits. No signup or reports required.\nEveryone who pledges at the $10 level or more gets a FREE copy of Broadsword Magazine preview.\nHere is what you can expect from each of the pledge levels.\n Supporter - You just love us and want to show your support. Awwwww, thanks! :)\n Broadsword #1 PDF only - You just want to read it and print the magazine at your leisure. This pledge level is only $10 and includes all the cool DMDave/JDRussell content.\n Broadsword #1 Print and PDF - You want to get the first issue of Broadsword in a print-ready PDF format as well as the printed collector's copy. This pledge level is only $15 and will include all stretch goals.\n Broadsword 3-Month Subscription (Print & PDF) - You want to see what's up with the first three issues of Broadsword magazine in both printed and PDF format. This pledge level is only $42 (you save $1 per issue) and includes all stretch goals.\n Broadsword 6-Month Subscription (Print & PDF) - You're down with Broadsword and want to see the first six issues of this milestone series in both printed and PDF format. This pledge level is only $84 and includes all stretch goals (you save $1 per issue).\n Broadsword 12-Month Subscription (Print & PDF) - You're so enthusiastic about Broadsword, you want the first twelve issues of the mag coming straight to your inbox and mailbox. This pledge level is $144 and includes all stretch goals (you save $3 per issue).\nWe're launching Broadsword Magazine with options for advertisers, too!\nJust like the old RPG magazines, we plan on doing some throwback ads both on the rear and interior covers, as well as four pages at the rear of the magazine, and a center insert with smaller ads (kinda like a \"trading post\").\nWhat's a throwback ad?\nBlack-and-white, artwork of questionable integrity, etc. You may even reference your fancy, new fangled world-wide-web webpage on the interwebs. \nEven though these \"website\" things sound like a fad. Obviously.\nWhat do ads cost?\nAd prices are fixed right now, meaning no matter how many people jump on this Kickstarter, we're going to keep the rate the same for the first issue. \nThat means your ad could be seen by thousands of qualified shoppers for an extremely low rate (cheaper than newspaper ads, but with a more targeted marketing).\nFor those who are worried about too many ads, don't worry. These ads are mostly for fun to add to the old school vibe. The kitschier, the better! Plus, we're only giving up 5% of the entire magazine for this ad space.\nHere are the current ad tiers:\n Full-page/full-color advertisement (only 3 available). These advertisements will be printed on the back of the magazine cover and on the interior covers just like in the old school magazines. Starts at $300. Plus, you get one month of advertising on DMDave.com (100,000 impressions per month), newsletter mentions, plus Instagram and Facebook shoutouts.\n Full-page/black-and-white advertisement (only 4 available). These advertisements will appear in the back of the magazine on the last 4 pages. Starts at $225. Plus, you get one month of advertising on DMDave.com (100,000 impressions per month), newsletter mentions, plus Instagram and Facebook shoutouts.\n 2.5\" by 4.75\" advertisement (Black/White) (only 40 available). These small ads will appear throughout the magazine, again adding to the \"old school vibe\" of Broadsword. Starts at $40. Plus, you get 8,000 impressions on DMDave.com.\n\nPlus, all advertisers get a PDF copy and physical of Broadsword #1!\nEven if you don't have a business, you can use the ad to say thanks! Or give a shoutout to somebody you love, or even propose to JD Russell.\nAd-Ons for Additional Issues\nSome of you have expressed interest in getting both an add and the full subscription plan. Here's how you can do it:\n1) Select the advertising plan that you want to do.\n2) Adjust your pledge amount up by one of the following subscription plans (it already includes the first issue):\n3-month subscription: +$36 (includes shipping, US only)\n6-month subscription: +$87 (includes shipping, US only)\n12-month subscription: +$165 (includes shipping, US only)\n3) Email me at hamrickbrands@gmail.com or contact me via Instagram to confirm your intention.\nFor details on how to do all this, here's a guide for add-ons: How to Do Add-Ons\nSo who are the creative nut jobs behind this incredible project? Here are the folks involved in the creation of Broadsword Magazine: \nJustin David Russell (Epic Werkes Studios), Artist and Creator is also a grognard roleplayer, having played just as long (if not longer). He's the creator of the The Forsaken Peak adventure path's setting, the illustrator of all the maps, interior artwork, and cover illustrations for Broadsword magazine. He's one of the hardest working illustrators in the roleplaying world today.  You can see his artwork above.\nDave Hamrick, Designer and Publisher has been a roleplayer and GM for nearly 28 years. He's also a full time writer and author, business owner, and game designer. He's the guy that maintains DMDave.com and writes most of the material for it (over 500 articles with nearly 1,000,000 words of original Fifth Edition content), including all adventures in the first issue of Broadsword magazine. This isn't his first rodeo, either. He's owned an Amazon business for four years as well as multiple digital media sites and has countless contacts in both the game and product fulfillment industry.\nStill not sold? Check out what folks have to say about our content:\n\"Amazing content and takes into careful consideration all mechanics and lore surrounding not just 5e but prior editions.\" - Facebook fan\n\"Great Content. Good ideas and monster creation.\" - Facebook fan\n\"Keep up the great work, DMDave, really enjoy all your creations!\" - Patreon fan\nRegarding the launch of BroadSword magazine:\n\"Cool! This sounds awesome and I\u2019m looking forward to checking it out when it goes live. Always looking for 5e adventures done in the vein of old Dungeon Magazine.\" - Kickstarter Follower\n\"Yes, and yes. Did I say yes? Yes I did.\" - Kickstarter Follower\n\"I\u2019m super pumped for this can\u2019t wait I\u2019ll definitely be get the year subscription on launch.\" - Kickstarter Follower\nFrom Kickstarter Backers:\n\"I have a 0% chance to be able to write/edit/make something like this happen but for the last year or so I have been hoping that SOMEONE would make a magazine similar to Dungeon. I am just a print kind of guy, PDFs don't do it for me.\" - Kickstarter Backer\n\"Thank you and I'm excited about this. I was a very long-time subscriber to Dragon, Dungeon, and Kobold Quarterly so this is exactly what I've been waiting for!\" - Kickstarter Backer\n20,500 + Followers on Instagam (with a 20%+ engagement rate)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe entire magazine is drafted and ready. We've sourced the costs with manufacturers and they're just waiting for our final art. The only thing missing are the commissions and backer elements as well as any necessary adjustments from playtesting. All of the interior cartography is completed as well as is the cover art and most of the interior art. However, there's still a little work to do in art, adding in any extra details, playtesting, editing, and development, not to mention layouts and final designs.\n\nHowever, Dave Hamrick, the lead designer has been a professional game and product designer and fulfillment specialist for four years. He already owns his own Amazon business and has an extremely popular website with 150,000+ monthly viewers. Plus, he has multiple contacts in the book industry and China and a printer is already lined up with deposits pre-placed. In addition, he's working closely with veterans of Kickstarter projects, with over 5 projects between them. Finally, he writes for a company that specializes in product development and design with over 100 employees. All of these experts are assisting in consultation on the product to ensure success of the Kickstarter itself and its subsequent fulfillment.\n\nFor future issues, submissions will be accepted to ensure regular content and DMDave has nearly 600+ original articles on his site to pull from if need be (including a ton of previously unreleased articles). \n\nPlus, we're giving ourselves 4-5 months before the first issue to create the first six issues' worth of content. Our printers are already prepared for monthly editions and will have proofs/artwork/etc in their hands 2-3 months in advance of printing. Any hiccups in transport, content creation, etc. will be communicated to all subscribers in advance so if there are any problems subscribers will have plenty of advance notice. If the magazine ends for any reason, any outstanding fees will be returned to subscribers in a pro-rated format.\n\nThere are no additional projects on the table. This is it. Nothing to get in the way or screw up logistics.\n\nWe require no external review or approval from other companies to make this magazine happen, and we've been working on it long enough to see it is coming together well.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Support the Project", "descp": "You get the project news and updates, and your name gets mentioned in our acknowledgements section.

Prior to using the material contained within please be sure to discuss with your group what you plan to include in your game. \nLamp\u2019s Light was written for mature audiences. It is designed to portray a gritty, unsettling, and evocative setting so you and your players can delve into aspects of the game that are not typically explored. Our intent is not to shock, offend, or demean anyone. That said, this supplement explores many behaviors and situations that may not be suitable for all audiences. \nThe classic tropes and creatures of horror are widely used within the 5th edition of the world\u2019s most famous roleplaying game and yet few would consider it a \u201chorror\u201d game. Why is that? The heroes are larger than life, their actions do not generally have long-term consequences, and a horde of flesh-eating ghouls is little more than a momentary distraction. Clearly copious amounts of blood, violence, and gore do not make a game a horror game. To instill a sense of horror \u2014 or more accurately, dread \u2014 in a 5th edition game, other modalities should be explored.\nLamp\u2019s Light Sanitarium\nLamp\u2019s Light as a setting focuses primarily on two things: the horrors that are inflicted upon others, in particular the mentally ill, disadvantaged, and forgotten; and the slow loss of control of oneself as psychic, intellectual, and emotional scars accumulate over a lifetime of conflict. \nWithin the walls of Lamp\u2019s Light Sanitarium, you will find all manner of medical marvels. The sick will be healed, the lame made to walk again, the mute will regain their voices, and miracles are seemingly an everyday occurrence. The facility\u2019s reputation amongst the wealthy is spotless. The staff is educated, knows their place, and most importantly are discreet. The academic elite view Lucien Prosper\u2019s legacy as the pinnacle of research and cutting-edge treatments for maladies that cannot be cured by other means. The poor know that Lamp\u2019s Light helps them when it is able, taking in ailing children and afflicted adults who have nowhere else to turn. The religious orders of the city publicly praise Lamp\u2019s Light for their philanthropy, while privately condemning them for their reliance on the arcane arts of science and technology. \nThese wonders come at a price, one that Dr. Orson Renwick has paid countless times over his tenure. Dr. Renwick has been experimenting on his patients since shortly after the asylum opened its doors. All in the name of science, progress, and the greater good. With each success, and failure, his perception of acceptable evolved, twisted, and expanded to until no depredation was too taboo. The horrors he\u2019s inflicted upon countless patients all began with the best intentions.  \nIn the course of a lifetime of adventure, intrigue, and exploration our heroes face challenges that would break a normal man or woman. Luckily, they are made of sterner stuff and weather the storm to fight another day. The heroes have been a part of countless battles, exposed to effects that cause direct injury to their mind, met creatures whose very presence instills primal terror, and are targets of mind-affecting magic. Like anything exposed to the elements the small chips, cracks, and erosion wears away the outer shell until all that\u2019s left is the exposed, raw core. The psychic scars left behind change a character. \nThe Book\nLamp\u2019s Light is a fully realized horror sourcebook for the 5th edition of the world\u2019s most famous roleplaying game. This black and white campaign guide has an expected page count of 130+ pages. As stretch goals are met additional content will be added and the book expanded to accommodate. \nLamp\u2019s Light Sanitarium is a sprawling estate beautifully detailed in hand drawn maps by Toby Lancaster of Dark Realm Maps. The asylum is charted with six individual maps each of which has dozens of fully described rooms. The asylum is equally at home as an oasis in an urban environment or as an idyllic country estate. The characters, themes, and setting are distinctly Victorian with Gothic and steampunk elements.\nMap excerpt from Dark Realm Maps\nLamp\u2019s Light Sanitarium is, above all else, a framework that can generate dozens of adventures, full campaigns, and countless hours of roleplaying. Adventure hooks are included throughout the book to fire the imagination of DMs and players. Sections include:\n Lamp's Light in Your Campaign: How to incorporate Lamp's Light into an existing campaign such as those available Wizards of the Coast, Kobold Press, and other publishers.\n New adventures: Discordant Scriptures (a Lamp's Light adventure for mid-level PCs). An alien intelligence has been drawn to the confluence of dissonant minds contained within Lamp\u2019s Light. Administrator Rose, at the behest of her patron, has urged the residents of the facility to record their mad dreams within the pages of a dream journal. Rose believes that the collected journals contain within them the knowledge needed to release her patron from its imprisonment on another plane. Tabula Rosa (a Lamp's Light adventure for low level PCs) begins with the players as unwilling patients and subjects of test experiments. They are quickly drawn into the intrigues of the asylum and must make difficult decisions if they are to escape.\n Story frameworks: In additional to Discordant Scriptures there will be half a dozen 2-3 page story frameworks ready for you to customize and build upon for your individual campaigns. \nPatient 11 and Dr. Orson Renwick by Matt Ray\nKey staff, patients and other inhabitants of Lamp\u2019s Light are detailed with statblocks, backgrounds, illustrations, and everything needed to incorporate them into your sessions. Dr. Renwick, Administrator Rose, and the man known as Patient 11 are but a few of the NPCs walking the halls of Lamp\u2019s Light. Orderlies, Patients, and other creatures are covered in the same level of detail.  \n New Rules for Managing Sanity \nart by Samantha Darcy\nThe sanity and madness rules presented enhance role-playing, create challenges for the players, and bring more color to your game. 5th edition characters are, above all else, exceptional. They are capable of winning virtually any fight, overcoming epic challenges, and creating miracles. These rules keep that spirit in mind. \nThe 20 pages of new rules build upon the framework provided by the DMG. There are expansive tables for transient, short-term, long-term, and indefinite madness, with nearly 50 different entries describing the narrative and mechanical effects on the character. \nFor DMs looking for more color without the added mechanical crunch the narrative descriptions provide ample fodder for you and your players to role-play.\nLast, but not least, there will be a custom form-fillable PDF character sheet fully compatible with the sanity rules. \nThe Pledge Levels\n$1 \u2013 Visitor\u2019s Pass: Thank you and access to backer only updates\nDM Screen Insert of New Sanity Rules (PDF)\n$5 \u2013 Curious Observer: You get a copy of the Sanity Rules written for Lamp\u2019s Light and a custom form-fillable PDF character sheet for 5e\nLamp\u2019s Light Custom Character Sheet\nSanity and Madness Rules\n DM Screen Insert of New Sanity Rules (PDF)\n$15 \u2013 Frenetic Patient: as above, you also get a PDF of Lamp\u2019s Light Sanitarium, and your name in the book\nDM Screen Insert of New Sanity Rules (PDF)\nYour name will appear in the book\nLamp\u2019s Light PDF; DRM-free and indexed\nLamp\u2019s Light Custom Character Sheet\nSanity and Madness Rules\n DM Screen Insert of New Sanity Rules (PDF)\n$21 \u2013 Devoted Alienist: as above, and POD (backer pays for print cost + shipping) through DriveThruRPG\nPhysical book (POD, backer pays print and shipping costs)\nYour name will appear in the book\nLamp\u2019s Light PDF; DRM-free and indexed\nLamp\u2019s Light Custom Character Sheet\nSanity and Madness Rules\n DM Screen Insert of New Sanity Rules (PDF)\n$40 \u2013 Faculty Consultation:  As above, and Dr. Renwick will write a psychiatric evaluation for you on one of your characters or one of your player's character.

My goal is a timely and efficient turn-around after successful funding. To accomplish this contracts and collaborations with other creators have already been initiated and in many cases completed. This is where we\u2019re at now:\nThe manuscript is in editing. \nThe cover is complete. \nCartography for the three main floors of the asylum is complete. \nStory art is completed. \nPortraits and NPC art are 50% complete.\nAll artists have been identified and are ready to begin their commissions.\nLayout has been contracted and is ready to go.\nShipping: Print Book Fulfilled by DTRPG\nThe backer tier price is low for the print version because you will be paying DTRPG directly for base print cost and shipping. DriveThru RPG can ship to you from a nearby distribution center, which equals better shipping costs for you, especially outside of the United States.\nWhen you back the print version of Lamp\u2019s Light Sanitarium you will receive a redemption code that gets you the complete book; you only pay the cost of printing and shipping through DriveThru RPG.\nHow Much Will the Print Book Cost?\nWe won't know until the final version is submitted to DriveThru RPG for approval, but their cost calculator says a 130 page softcover (large, black & white) comes to ~$4.50 USD. https://www.drivethrurpg.com/pub_pod_cost.php\nHow Much Will Shipping Cost?\nThis will vary by country, the final page count, and the final weight of the book.

Alessia casts off the traditional fantasy assumptions and introduces players to a wider world with a host of new species, technology, powers, and places to explore - for both Starfinder and 5e.\nA terran monk and his allies battle a summoned servant of the Cult of Galgar\u00e6. ~Illustration by Septimius Ferdian\nThe World of Alessia is a high-fantasy campaign setting that combines Wuxia, science fiction, and magic-driven technology. It is a massive world where magic and technology coexist peacefully, impacting every aspect of life, from the Healing Houses of Sillias to the Great Towers of Xin. It is a land where Fyrean Genies meet with Asrian Wardens and The Gangs of Khatu push their Drifters across the desert sands, seeking resources and victims of every kind.\nMockup image of the Campaign Primer\nThe World of Alessia Campaign Primer is a comprehensive introduction to Alessia. The primer includes details on the world of Alessia, its threats, the factions that drive its politics, and the many people who walk Alessia's streets.\nA host of new familiars grace the pages of the primer.\nBeautifully illustrated with full-color art, the World of Alessia Campaign Primer will inspire GMs while providing players with a host of new options to take their 5e or Starfinder game to the next level.\nThe World of Alessia Campaign Primer brings you:\n11 new races (and more with each stretch goal we achieve).\n4 new classes - the Marauder, the Psion, the Seer, and the Tecker.\nA system of Stunts and Resolve (for 5e play).\nA garage full of new gear, vehicles, armor, and weapons for your 5e and Starfinder games.\nNew rules for attaining unique familiars.\nAnd lots more awesome options for your game!\nTake a peek at the four new classes.\nMarauders are trained to bring the pain.\nA modern-day gunslinger with a penchant for heavy weapons, the marauder specializes in energy and kinetic missile weapons of all sorts; whether using energy rifles or high-powered ballistics, these individuals bring the pain - often from far away.\nTeckers make it happen!\n A step above mere \u201ctinkerers,\u201d teckers represent the inquisitive mind turned outward, specifically toward some of Alessia\u2019s dangerous elements; at 3rd level, most teckers choose a specialty, becoming breachers (magical hackers and intrusion specialists), devs (device hackers and magitech specialists), or speeders (vehicle experts).\n\nA gnole psion enhances his weapons.\nFairly common among the Elathi, the psion is a master of the mind. Psions spend their lives navigating the inner spaces; as a class, psions focus on making excellent use of their natural psychic abilities to solve problems and defend their allies.\n\nAn elven seer plays with the local kaima.\n Seers operate on the other end of the spectrum, working in tandem with Alessia\u2019s spirits, specifically the Kaima. Common among the Celestia, as well as the Elath, Seers spend their days whispering the unseen, either to help or to harm.\n\nAre you ready to learn more about Alessia?\nZhang Wei, Imperial Peacekeeper\nTake a look at Alessia through the eyes of Seirye Qin, Captain of the Skyship Amethyst Myst. When you're done learning about her, take a look at Xei, Dragonsworn Ghost Monk, the honorable Zhang Wei, Human Peacekeeper, or even one of the mysterious Elathi.\nWho are the Ish'ra?\nWhile many of the traditional fantasy races exist in Alessia, some do not. Moreover, the humans of Alessia are not the dominant species on the planet. The humans share that position with their cousins, the Djinnkin, and Terrans. Compared to the Y\u00f6kai and all their lines, the humans are a small line indeed.\nThe Treah are one of Alessia's core races.\n Creatures born to defend the Trees of Life, the Treah are a race of bipedal, humanoids with bark-like skin and fibrous frames. Because of their natural connection to the Trees of Life, Treah frequently become druids and rangers. The Treah have traditions, as well. These traditions encourage the Treah to take up several Sacred Paths, eventually turning these seedlings into Dream Wardens and Envoys of the Green.\nVelestrian elves work hand in hand with the Treah to protect the fabled Trees of Life\n The dominant people of the continent of Velestra, elves have a complex, sometimes confusing social hierarchy that many outsiders find off-putting. Although elves see themselves as a single people, much of Alessia classifies them according to their homeland; Fyreani (widely known as desert elves) roam much of Alessia\u2019s eastern lands, while the Velestrians (also known as green or wood elves) stand sentry for the fabled Trees of Life. The Un\u2019Seeliaha (commonly known as dark elves) are the final group of elves. Rejected by the Trees of Life for reasons known only to the elves, this group of outcasts \u2013 their skins marked with arcane sigils for their crimes \u2013 wanders the southern coasts of Galgar\u00e6, living along the coastlines.\nThe Celestia first appeared after the Old Gods disappeared.\n Beings infused with The Light, the very first Celestia rose from the ashes of the War of Sovereigns like saints among men, taking on the holy charge of The Light and helping to carve out what would later become the Holy Kingdom of Asrai. Naturally biased toward the light, the Celestia resemble Humans or Terrans, often with soft and symmetrical features. Naturally beautiful, these beings have no problem attuning to the Light. Some Celestia (although not all) are born with large, angel-like wings.\nAfter several millennia on Alessia, the Ish'ra now call this pale blue dot home.\n One of Alessia\u2019s oldest races, the Ish\u2019ra were refugees when the Y\u00f6kai were still young; fleeing from the dark spaces beyond the void, the Ish\u2019ra voidship The Enduring Dream breached Alessia\u2019s atmosphere when the Y\u00f6kai Warlords were still in power, crashing into central Elysia and depositing her survivors all along Elysian coasts. Having naturalized to Alessia over their millennia-long stay, the Ish\u2019ra now proudly identify as natives to their new home. Natural psychics with several technical aptitudes, the Ish\u2019ra have contributed to much of Alessia\u2019s progress.\nXei, like all Ghost Blade Monks, stands guard against evil Kaima\n A people torn between two times, the Dragonsworn of ancient Alessia have a developed and evolved culture that betrays all of the outside stereotypes with glee. From their colorful festivals to their colorful scales, Truescales can trace their clutches back to the very first celestial dragons. Their lesser brethren, which shallow individuals call Dullscales, bear no patterns of lineage, nor \u201cany true history of scale or struggle.\u201d Instead, these persons have transformed themselves through alchemy, magic, or science; sometimes all three.\nAn Elathi seer prepares a spell.\nOne of Alessia\u2019s evolved peoples, the Elathi enjoy some of the visual markers of their elven ancestry, though they are not elves. Today, the Elathi divide themselves into two ancestral lines. The Telathians regard themselves as the natural evolution of elves and have crystalized horns through which they focus their psionic powers. The Illathi lack crystalized horns, but instead enjoy a natural aptitude for \u201clight-shaping\u201d and celestial skills.\nA Terran Cleric of the Light\nStanding slightly taller than your average human, Terrans evolved beside side-by-side with their human and Djinnkin cousins in the heart of Fyrea. Expanding rapidly beside their human cousins and enjoying a slight evolutionary advantage, the Terrans of Alessia now occupy every corner of the planet. Slightly stronger than humans on average, Terrans are also adept climbers, as well as wrestlers \u2013 easy tasks for individuals with an extra set of arms!\nA Fengu Ninja draws her blade.\n Native to the lands that existed before The Great Beast Galgar\u00e6 crashed into cold, dark earth, the Fengu are a broken people. Denied flight by evolution, the Fengu have become a wandering people, traveling the broken coastline of their former homeland, battling for resources while actively engaging the Spawn of Galgar\u00e6.\nA Pandren monk readies his weapon.\n One of the few races that might consider being called Onikuma a compliment, Pandrens are large, muscular warriors evolved from Alessia\u2019s native pandas. Prominent members of the Council of Yerwin, the Pandrens sought sanctuary in Pyrrin Isles and remained there until embracing the Empire of Xian.\nThe Weaslings are exceptionally talented, especially when it comes to tech.\nHaving evolved on the eastern plains of Yerwin, the Weaslings are a race of hyper-intelligent polecats whose agility and charm makes them popular entertainers throughout the Empire of Xian. Talented pilots with a natural affinity for technology, the quickest way to encourage violence is to mention its pelt.\nA Djinnkinn warrior leaps into battle.\nThe offspring of the great Lords of Brass and their human servants, the Djinnkin are also known as Djinnkinn or simply \u2018Kin (and informal, casual greeting shared between aligned houses). Born with all the heat, sun, and motivation someone traveling the deserts of Fyrea could want, the Djinnkin are a resourceful people whose magical gifts and love of transforming cultures and places adds guides their slow expansion throughout Alessia.\nThe World of Alessia is a Wuxia-inspired campaign setting with over two-dozen intelligent, bipedal species united together against the encroaching darkness - which Alessia now faces on multiple fronts. On the planet itself, heroes battle extremists, cultists, and stand watch against incursions from the Spawn of Galgar\u00e6.\n In the skies above Alessia, brave Skyship Captains and Imperial Marines work in tandem to keep the Ring of Heaven functioning, so that Alessia remains shielded from the void beyond.\nA terran seer and her Ish'ra ally look down on the gates of the Holy City of Asrai. ~Illustration by Le Minh Hoai Quoc\nWith more advanced magic and technology, the people of Alessia must confront old problems in new ways.\nWhen the last of the Sovereigns departed, they left Alessia with two gifts - the Ring of Heaven and The Light. The ring is a celestial artifact that works in tandem with the light, defending Alessia against her external threats. \nThe Light is a story. \nIn the wake of the War of the Sovereigns, the people of Alessia looked upward and found, for a time, only silence. When the surviving Sovereigns announced their departure from Alessia, they an entity is known only as The Light.\nIn Alessia, the light manifests through younger adults, manifesting in their early teens and empowering them each in unique ways. Deep in the Holy Kingdom of Asrai, the Holy Prophet of Light watches over world events, considering how best to act for her people.\nKickstarter continues to provide us with the best platform for funding and delivering great projects to gamers the world over. This year, we're launching our most ambitious project to date, one we've been working on for nearly a year now. While we've purchased enough art to make this our most beautiful book yet, we're also bringing back some of our favorite game designers to expand the primer, so we can pack it with all the awesome you'd demand from a great gaming book.\nXei, monk of the Ghost Blade leads a team against a Spawn of Galgar\u00e6 in the caverns below the Fields of Neph in eastern Shiran. ~Illustration by Septimius Ferdian.\nFor this Kickstarter, Storm Bunny Studios will be working directly with DriveThru RPG to deliver a print-on-demand version of the World of Alessia Campaign Primer to ensure delivery to our European backers is as affordable as possible by allowing us to print in the U.K. and ship to you directly.

That force, comprised of the best-of-the-best from all over the globe, is Freedom Squadron!  \nPlayers take on the role of those who've heeded the call to action. They are new Recruits who must first earn their stripes to become Commandos. Eventually, if they live up to the expectations of trainers like Sandbar, Corporal Carnage, Preedatore, and Blindsight, they may earn their Code Names and carry the fight to VENOM anywhere in the world... and beyond!  \n\"Savage Worlds was created to handle the kinds of games I often like to play and run, where you can be a badass fighter or wizard or whatever, but you can also be a leader. A planner. I'm proud of how the game accommodates that, and my friend Sean Patrick Fannon has added even more to it in Freedom Squadron.\nI had a blast in the Plans & Operations phase riffing off the other players, figuring out how best to use our individual characters' skills, and then watching it all come together in the adventures that followed. Sean isn't afraid of big games and big ideas, and this may be his best yet. I can't wait to back, buy, and run it myself!\"\n-Shane Lacy Hensley (Code Name: BUBBLES), veteran author and game designer, creator of Savage Worlds\u00ae, CEO Pinnacle Entertainment Group\nFreedom Squadron has many new features for Savage Worlds\u00ae fans. Written and designed by Sean Patrick Fannon (Shaintar, Savage Rifts\u00ae), these are special rules both inspired by his previous work and brand new for this setting. These include:  \nPlans & Operations: A unique combination of core Savage Worlds\u00ae game play elements that allows players to engage in multiple missions and actions in an \"action cinema montage\" style. Intelligence gathering, tactical positioning, investigations, covert insertions, computer hacking\u2014anything and everything special ops Commandos might do between their epic battles with VENOM and other enemies. Fast-paced, inclusive, and designed to feature all of a hero's skills, the Plans & Operations rules are sure to enhance any Savage Worlds\u00ae game.\n\nVocation Frameworks and Specializations: Inspired and adapted from the character creation rules of Savage Rifts\u00ae, these allow the player to choose a starting package of skills and abilities that reflect their primary role in the team, while also gaining cool extra abilities rolled randomly from various interesting charts. This is all on top of the usual core Savage Worlds\u00ae character building process.\nNew Edges: like Fighting Style, Operational Planning, Qi Focus, Strange DNA, and the innovative Zone Specialist (allowing heroes to truly shine in various environments like Arctic, Mountain, or Sea Zones). \nSkill Focuses, Gear Points, and much, much more!\nPsi War Big Epic Game at Ghengis Con\nFreedom Squadron for Savage Worlds\u00ae, is based on VENOM Assault\u00ae, the board game created by SpyGlass Games. Evil Beagle Games has worked with World Designer Michael Knight to not only bring the world to life, but to expand on it as well.\nSupplemental gaming accessories not included. Final design subject to change.\n While VENOM Assault\u00ae is not required at all in order to immerse yourself in the world of Freedom Squadron, you can check out SpyGlass Games' website to view many character bios and even purchase the game!\nPinnacle Entertainment Group has created one of the most popular game systems in the world with Savage Worlds\u00ae, specifically oriented towards pulp and cinema action experiences. Sean Patrick Fannon of Evil Beagle Games has worked with them for years, and is the mastermind behind Savage Rifts\u00ae. Creating Freedom Squadron for Savage Worlds\u00ae was never a question.\nWith Pinnacle's new release of Flash Gordon\u2122 the Roleplaying Game, featuring many new rules updates, Freedom Squadron\u00ae is completely up-to-date and represents the state-of-the-art for Savage Worlds\u00ae fans.\nNew To Savage Worlds?\nIf you're new to the Savage Worlds\u00ae rules system, Freedom Squadron\u00ae does require the core rulebook to play. You can get it in print and PDF from Pinnacle's website. Pinnacle Entertainment Group publishes and manufactures the Savage Worlds\u00ae rules book, and maintains this website.\n\"Freedom Squadron offers an RPG experience like no other. This game is bursting with nostalgic tropes and themes, added to the rock-solid gameplay of the Savage Worlds system. The Plans & Operations rules are an innovative mechanic that focuses the action right where it belongs: on your characters facing down VENOM. Freedom Squadron is the perfect way to take on the roles of an elite, highly-trained special mission force and go on exciting adventures in this fully-realized setting!\" - Ross Watson (Code Name: SKIPPER), Product Line Manager Warhammer 40,000 Roleplay: Wrath & Glory; Lead Developer, Savage Rifts; Lead Writer/Designer, Accursed\n\u2022 The Freedom Squadron Commando's Manual:\nThis essential manual is used to create characters in the Freedom Squadron world that will be tough enough and strong enough to pit themselves against VENOM's evil forces. Freedom Squadron brings only the very best into its ranks, which means that every Recruit comes from a background of extensive education, training, and practical field experience. Many are veterans of World War III, other military conflicts, or are otherwise noted experts in their fields.\nPlayers will choose from a large list of Vocation Frameworks, make rolls on one or more Hero's Journey: Freedom Squadron Specialization charts, and either choose or randomly determine a Narrative Hook to design a robust character.\nSimilar to the Iconic Frameworks of Savage Rifts\u00ae, Vocation Frameworks represent a package of Edges, Skills, and special abilities that reflect the training and experience of a Recruit before they joined Freedom Squadron. Expect to find Frameworks such as Driver, Medic, Sailor, Soldier, Tech Specialist, and whole lot more!\nThe Hero's Journey tables are reminiscent of those found in other Savage Worlds\u00ae settings, such as Savage Rifts\u00ae. Each character will gain a number of rolls on select charts based on the player's choice of Vocation Framework. You can gain even more rolls by taking the Squadron Branch Training Edge later during character development. Example charts include Black Ops, Close Quarters Combat, Combat Medicine, Infantry, Logistics, and more.\nThe Narrative Hooks allow a possible connection with other players, as well as the establishing reasons for the hero to become part of Freedom Squadron.\nNew Edges, such as Operational Planning and Zone Specialist, bring new diversity and strengths into Savage Worlds\u00ae. The former enhances the leadership role for any hero who goes that route, while the latter lets characters that are adept at operating within a particular type of terrain really shine in those circumstances.\nBeyond character creation, the Commando's Manual contains essential background history of the world, it's current geo-political status, and the full structure of the Freedom Squadron: Global Operations Force. There's also an arsenal of weapons, equipment, and vehicles (and a Gear Points system for managing who can carry what into the field, and how they can customize their gear). Armed with everything within this book, a well rounded character will be ready to bring down VENOM's plans once and for all!\nFinal design subject to change.\n\u2022 The Freedom Squadron Plans & Operations Manual:\nMore than just a Game Master's handbook, this revolutionary manual contains the tools necessary to run the Plans & Operations phases for campaigns that will make Freedom Squadron\u00ae such a powerful and player-driven experience for fans. As well, the information in this book can easily be adapted to run P&O style sessions in any Savage Worlds\u00ae setting\u2014high fantasy adventurers trying to solve a royal murder; investigators into eldritch horrors tracking down cult activities and ancient artifacts; modern-day mission specialists breaking into enemy strongholds; cyberpunk-style data stealing runs; and much more!\nThis special set of rules is designed to integrate the planning stage of a mission with actual game play. What often used to be a tedious, drawn-out part of many games has now been transformed into something fun and playable as a series of \"mini-games\".\nThis system also brings out the skills and talents of heroes that aren't always as combat-intensive in nature, such as technical abilities and social skills.\nEntire intelligence gathering missions, preemptive battles, social interactions, data hacks, and more quickly become a part of the game session with detailed stories that do not sacrifice hours of game-play.\nSupplimental gaming accessories not included. Final design subject to change.\nThe Plans & Operations Manual works in conjunction with a special set of cards, known as The Plans & Operations Deck. This deck allows for the randomization of mission parameters to be set forth, while still leaving the specifics of the mission vague enough to be able to be integrated into any situation. The result is immersive, fun, and fast.\nFinal design subject to change.\nCheck out this tutorial video where the designer himself, Sean Patrick Fannon, tells you how it works and shows you a sample round of game play with some of his friends.\nThe Freedom Squadron Plans & Operations Manual also contains valuable Game Master information, including a Random Mission Generator system; GM-specific information about VENOM and other antagonists; basic stats for VENOM and other likely foes; and more!\nAdd-On's are optional, additional items that can be added to any Backer Level by increasing your Pledge Level, or by using JetBacker after the Kickstarter ends. As Add-on's are unlocked via Stretch Goals, we will list them here for an easy-view list!\n\u2022 The Freedom Squadron Commando Manual: $25.00\n\u2022 The Freedom Squadron Plans & Operations Manual: $25.00\n\u2022 The Plans & Operations Deck: $15.00\nNote: Additional Shipping may apply.\nAfter multiple requests and great suggestions, we at Evil Beagle Games and SpyGlass Games realize we are best served paying attention to our great fans and backers. Thus, we're announcing a few Backer Goals that will unlock a little differently than standard Stretch Goals. On the Stretch Goal list, we've carefully crafted everything to reflect amazing additions that will unlock as fast as we can, while making sure that we can confidently bring them to you within the budget we've strategically worked out. With that careful balance in mind, we chose to add a separate list of great ideas that unlocks as we attain a total quantity of backers. In this way, we hope you will then be encouraged to go out and bring in more folks to back at whatever level they might choose. Should you have any other ideas that you want to see come to life in this Kickstarter, leave us a comment, and we may just have to look into what it would take to make your concept a reality!\n\"I hear the booted footsteps of VENOM commandos rushing up from behind me. I tighten my bandanna as a smirk curls my lips. The moment is right, and my grenade lands perfectly next to the fuel tanks. They didn't have a chance. Without looking back, I stride away from the explosion as the guitar riff crescendos. That's Freedom Squadron!\" - Wendelyn Reischl (Code Name: ROOK), Contributing Writer & Game Designer, Warhammer 40,000 Roleplay: Wrath & Glory; author for Gnome Stew; founder of Denver RPG Meetup (one of the world's largest RPG meetups); Board of Directors, Gamers Giving\n\"The first time I sat down for Freedom Squadron I was enthralled.

You need to play this!\u201d - Robert Dorf (Code Name: KIAI), RPG reviewer, longtime Champions fan and beloved GM, renowned scholar of luchador history and other artifacts of popular culture obscura\n\"The perfect blend of techno-thriller action and Saturday Morning Cartoon awesomeness. The Plans & Operations system is a player driven system that not only rewards clever thinking, careful planning, and teamwork, but makes these things fun and the seed for great roleplaying opportunities.\" - John Atkinson (Code Name: IRON), early supporter, military historian, and instructor in military tactics and planning.\n\"The Planning & Operations deck really brings the game to life! Everybody in the group gets to participate, regardless of their skills and focuses. The cards truly make you feel like a team actively working together to achieve the mission; no one gets left behind. And that is a Freedom fact!\" - Nestor Rodriguez (Code Name: DANCER), longtime Champions fan and highly respected GM and player.\nEvil Beagle Games has worked very closely with a number of FLGS locations in order to offer an amazing Kickstarter experience!\nPlease visit the Retail Backer Level website for terms and conditions: Retail Backers.\nPlease remember to check back often to see if new Retail-only Stretch Goals have been unlocked for you to benefit from!\nFor Retail Backers Only\nAll shipping will be charged after the campaign via JetBacker, our Pledge Manager.

No matter who you are... \nRPG DESIGN CAMP is here for you! \nThis time we are taking an older adventure, the Silver Box, and letting you adapt, change and add to it to make it awesome! \nIn the Silver Box a thrilling encounter with highwaymen uncovers a missing artifact that hurls the PCs into an amazing adventure. The chase leads them on a woodland pursuit into a cave complex where the mystery only increases with the discovery of a pile of dead highwaymen. Who killed the thieves? And where is the Silver Box? From there the PCs follow clues to a nearby city and a series of thrilling urban encounters. Finally, in the conclusion, the heroes face off against the real thieves of the Silver Box in a dramatic shipboard battle in the city harbor. \nOr does it? Your decisions can and probably will alter the adventure toward new directions. \nPerhaps the whole adventure will take place in the cave complex\nPerhaps the city will turn out to be under siege by a vampire hoard\nPerhaps the conclusion will be atop a floating tower rather than a ship? \nThe options are limitless and the deciding factor is you! Don\u2019t just run the adventure be part of the design process and choose the adventure! \nWhat is Design Camp?\nDesign Camp is a collaborative experience where game designers and interested individuals share the process of RPG content creation-- sometimes that means writing a supplement, or an adventure, or setting material, or, like this project, converting a manuscript from one game system to another.\nThe adventure we're planning to convert is The Silver Box, formerly placed in the Iron Kingdoms setting, and covering a number of urban and wilderness locations with a variety of NPCs. We'll discuss it more in updates.\nHow does Design Camp work?\nWe interact with backers through a Basecamp site on the internet (basecamp.com), using that site's infrastructure to chat, email, host files and communicate. We also post here on Kickstarter to provide redundant communication for the project. \nYou'll have a chance to pitch your own design elements during the process, and vote on submitted elements. If your element wins, you can work with designers to implement it, if you want, or you can leave it to us to make those proverbial donuts.\n\nWe work hard to make sure our process is fairly transparent and responsive to backers and their questions. In the end, we want you to understand and feel comfortable with the process of RPG design.\nOur philosophy?\nYou can do this. We know, because we got our start sitting where you're sitting, and ten years later, we're still designing, publishing, and winning awards. RPGs are for everyone. Designing them can be, too. Hold my dice, I got this. ;)\nFirst, we get together.\nThe brainstorming and discussion portions can be very active, as backers all add their thoughts and ideas to the start of a project. But they're just the beginning. We want you to ride this out to the end, and that means participating as we continue...\nThen, we plan out some stuff...\nOnce the outline is created, the base idea is decided, we start pitching specific ideas-- \"What about a cult? How should we present this material? What do we need to make this as useful as possible at the table? Do you need more detail? Less detail? Some weird details?\" This process is also pretty intense, and a lot of fun. Learning how to pitch and formulate ideas can be very rewarding.\nThen we light the fire and get to work!\nOur roots...\nWe all met and began working together as patrons of Kobold Press' Open Design projects, way back in 2007 and the Empire of the Ghouls. It's been gangbusters ever since, closing down Indianapolis bars and burning down orc encampments while cracking open planar portals to Yggdrasil.\n\nWe've written for Ars Magica, Pathfinder, and Dungeons & Dragons from Third Edition all the way to Fifth. We're familiar with a wide variety of systems and games.\nPledges....\nSo what are the levels you can choose to support? I'm glad you asked...\n  We appreciate everyone's support!\nYour name in glorious, glorious text. Well, maybe just one \"glorious.\"\nNow that's a smart move.\nThese are the goods-- maybe you don't have the time for all that interaction, but you want the final result. This is how you make that happen.\nIf you've got the time, taking a 20 is always the safest bet!\nYou like your games and your options. This is how you can compare the adventure in two systems while crushing the bad guys and looting their stuff.\nThis is the full experience.\nJoin us at basecamp, participate in the experience and get a PDF! This is the primary option, and we're going to work hard to make sure you get your money's worth.\nCohorts; letting GMs play the game since 1974!\nYou want to leave a little bit more of a mark on the project and this is how you're going to do it. At this level, you'll work with us to revise an NPC in the adventure to meet your descriptions. Or you can bring us your iconic player character and we'll include it as a pregen! This can be as hands-on intensive as you want, from saying \"I want a human fighter,\" to having a whole backstory to help us craft the details.\nSo, you want to call the shots?\nChallenge us! We're professionals! We can take it! At this level, you can challenge the designers with your encounter design idea. Bring us your combination of elements such as monster, terrain, location type...etc. and we will make it work! Conversely, you can throw in your idea as one of the Pitch Rounds to challenge all of the backers!\nLet's take a peek behind the screen, shall we?\nWe're always happy to lend our thoughts and considerations about a personal project, or to run an online game for you, and at this level, you'll get that benefit along with your Design Camp experience.\nWhat happens if the community is super generous and we get the opportunity to work with a bunch of you? Stretch goals, that's what!\n  Goals!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've run Design Camp before, and Ben, Brian, and Jaye are veterans of nearly a dozen other patron-based RPG projects. This is all about the experience, and so the risks here are minimal. \n\nWe're going to walk you through this process and get you that PDF at the end of things; hopefully, you're going to learn a bit about converting an adventure from one system to another along the way.\n\nWhat could happen? Well, one of us could get hit by the milk truck. Unlikely, but possible. Space debris could impact us. Again, might happen. With three of us working on this conversion, it should be able to handle events even as catastrophic as either of these. This manuscript is written and prepared for conversion. As long as one of us survives, you'll get your adventure, it just might take us a little longer. Seeing as this is all about learning the process, a slightly longer time spent on that process is actually a good thing for you.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Aid Another", "descp": "Thanks for the +2 bonus to hit (or AC)!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2018"}], "stat": ["4 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Gain Advantage!", "descp": "We list you as backer and you get a single PDF of your choice (5e).\nINCLUDES:\nThe Silver Box PDF (5e)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2018"}], "stat": ["23 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Take 10!", "descp": "We list you as backer and you get a PDF copy of the Pathfinder compatible adventure....\nINCLUDES:\nThe Silver Box PDF (Pathfinder)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2018"}], "stat": ["16 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Take 20!", "descp": "We list you as a backer and you get both PDFs (one for 5e and one for Pathfinder).\nINCLUDES:\nThe Silver Box PDF (5e)\nThe Silver Box PDF (Pathfinder)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2018"}], "stat": ["5 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "Skill Focus (game design)", "descp": "Join the rest of the Design Camp as we dive into our second project!

Check out the sample magical item, Abhorrent Naginata, available for free only during this KS campaign.  It's 10 pages of lavishly-detailed goodness, all dedicated to a single, nifty magic weapon.  It's a good example of what to expect... times dozens of items!\nIllustration credit Kim van Deun\nThis product is a massive, 200+ page full-color PDF and hardcover roleplaying supplement that will enhance any Pathfinder or 5E campaign in any setting.\nArtifacts & Artifice will be a richly detailed hardcover gaming sourcebook, and companion to one of the most ambitious and massive indie RPG adventures in recent memory.  \nAA2 Unlocked!\nAs of 16-May, we've unlocked the Stretch Goal of a second book: Artifacts & Artifice 2.  This will be \"more of the same\" goodness that is in AA1, plus more focus on integration with the mythology of Dark Obelisk and the campaign setting of the Realm of Aquilae.\nBackground & Overview  \nDark Obelisk 1 was planned to be a 64-page softcover urban adventure. After a successful Kickstarter campaign, and months of development, it evolved into a 1,000-page mega adventure with more than 50 NPCs, delivered in the form of two massive hardcover books.  \nDark Obelisk 2 was planned to be a modest continuation of the adventure path. In the course of its KS campaign, it saw a tenfold increase in funding, and more than a dozen Stretch Goals.\nOne of these Stretch Goals was \"Artifacts & Artifice\", initially intended as a 32-64-page softcover, that introduces some rare and exceedingly cool and unique magical items from the Realm of Aquilae, the campaign setting of Dark Obelisk.  \nIt was offered as an add-on for backers of Dark Obelisk 2.  In all honesty, it was created mainly as an excuse to collaborate with another successful and insanely creative indie RPG author.\nThis campaign seeks to make it more awesome, and to offer it to folks who didn't get a chance to get on board with it initially.\nIllustration credit Jack Kaiser\nContext & Project Goals\nThe world of Dark Obelisk is rich and deep, and yet the products published thus far have only scratched the surface of what will be an enormous mythology, spanning countless worlds.  Although products like the Extended Pregenerated Characters and Dark Obelisk 1 have enormous amounts of useful crunch and NPC / monster content, the world of Aquilae has not yet added a great deal of content to your campaign in the way of magical items, weapons, arms and armor.\nArtifacts & Artifice is a book intended to achieve many goals:\nAdd unique, interesting, and useful magical items (weapons, armor, spells, artifacts, wands, rods, rings, potions, and much more) to any RPG campaign.\nServe as a sourcebook of quick and easy-to-insert Quests and NPCs featuring the new items, that can be used in any RPG campaign or adventure.\nBe more than simply a \"list of items and stats\", making it easy for any GM to integrate the items into any campaign.\nIntegration\nThat second goal above, to make it easy for GMs to integrate items into a campaign, is important.  Most GMs have seen PDF after PDF, or book after book, of compendiums or sourcebooks that list out or include magical items.  Though many of these are high quality, most of them amount to \"here's the item, here's what it does\", and maybe if you're lucky there's a sentence or two of description.\nThat's not what Artifacts & Artifice is about.\nEach and every magical item will have a feel, a weight to it, imbued by 2-10 pages of dedicated content that supports more than just the ho-hum stats.  Each item will have the following:\nDescription and crunch effect, cost, etc. with example statblock(s) \nHistory and background \nRumors and lore \nOne or more quad-statted NPCs, who uses the item as part of their gear\nHooks to integrate the item into any campaign or adventure \nAt least one Quest featuring the item, its effects, its history, or the NPC example.\nIntegration With Dark Obelisk\nEvery item will not only be fleshed out and ready to easily insert into any RPG campaign, but will become part of the broader mythology introduced in Dark Obelisk, and the campaign setting of Aquilae.\nFuture books may reference these items, NPCs may wield or recognize them, or they may have a pivotal or minor plot role in a Quest or main storyline.\nIn Summary...\nThis is far, far beyond a simple list of magical items!\nCurrent Contents\nAs of this writing, Artifacts & Artifice will contain the following content.  Each item listed will have ~10 pages of lavishly-detailed content dedicated to it, as well as full-color artwork.  Some items, such as powerful Artifacts, may even end up having mini adventure modules dedicated to them in the book!\nNote that since we have unlocked a SECOND book, the counts below will be spread across the two books.  Which ones go where, and whether one or both books have a theme as such, is dependent upon what we end up with in terms of Stretch Goals and overall counts.\n56 Total Items:\n6x Magic Armor\n3x Amulets\n15x Magic Weapons\n8x Potions\n4x Magic Rings\n4x Magic Rod / Device\n2x Runes\n4x Magic Shields\n4x Wondrous Items\n6x Spells\nStretch Goals\nHuzzah, we're funded!  Time to reach for the stars and make everyone's end result even better.\nIn the list below, \"Standalone Adventures\" are just that: a chapter in the book that is dedicated to a one-off adventure, easily insertable into any campaign setting or context, that involves one or more magic items and/or NPCs from the book's content.  Some of these may be published or available outside of the Artifacts & Artifice book, but some will be exclusive to the book only.  Some of these could merely be slightly-more-elaborate Quests, and others might be 20+ page multiple-gaming-session behemoths.  (Titles subject to finalization.)\n\"+X items\" means the books grow: more items, more artwork, more Quests, more NPCs, more adventure hooks... more content!  Additional Stretch Goals that add items will do so to the \"pool\" of all items (see above), which will be spread across both books.\nAs with other Infinium Game Studio Kickstarters, each time one Stretch Goal falls, another will be announced!\nBacker Count Stretch Goal:\nUNLOCKED!  114th Backer: If (seemingly WHEN!) this project's backer count surpasses my previously-most-successful Kickstarter campaign, I will award a free NPC design and/or magic item design to the backer whose pledge brings us over that threshold.  This is a $75 value, and comes with a full-color illustration assigned to the character or item that that backer helps design.\nFinancial Stretch Goals:\nUNLOCKED!  $1,750: Unlock additional Master Artificer pledge level slot; +4 items.\nUNLOCKED! $2,000: Standalone Adventure: \"Twilight Durance\".\nUNLOCKED! $2,250: Unlock additional Master Artificer pledge level slot; +4 items.\nUNLOCKED!  $2,500: Second Book: A second Artifacts & Artifice tome will be produced, with new pledge levels to take advantage of this opportunity!\nUNLOCKED!  $3,000: AA1 will have at least 25 items.  AA2 will also have at least 25 items.  50 items total if you pledge to get both.  At least 400 pages of richly-detailed arcane content.\nUNLOCKED!  $3,250: +4 items, all of which will be in a single Set of gear with synergy bonuses.  With kick-butt dedicated art.\nUNLOCKED! $3,500: Standalone Adventure: \"Side Jobs and Second Chances\".\nUNLOCKED!  $3,750: +1 Artifact with several associated NPCs and Quests.\nUNLOCKED! $4,000: Standalone Adventure: \"Crucible of Shadow\".\nUNLOCKED! $4,250: Free Map Pack for all non-Lurker pledges!  Every pledge will receive a free Map Pack, containing ultra-hi-resolution images for each and every Quest-related map in BOTH AA books.  These map files are great for DMs who want to print their own battlemaps, or for those wishing to integrate them into a VTT kind of gaming approach.\nUNLOCKED! $4,500: Dedicated chapter for Clothing, including new clothing types such as Badges and Cravats.  Also includes a number of new magical items for whichever book ends up \"getting\" the chapter.\nUNLOCKED! $5,000: Dedicated chapter for Jewelry, including new types such as Torcs, Diadems, and Earrings.  Also includes a number of new magical items for whichever book ends up \"getting\" the chapter.\nUNLOCKED! $5,500: Dedicated chapter for Spells, including new magical items that are related to them.  Includes a number of new magical items for whichever book ends up \"getting\" the chapter.\nUNLOCKED!  $6,000: Dedicated chapter for Cursed Items.  Includes a number of new magical items for whichever book ends up \"getting\" the chapter.\nUNLOCKED!  $6,500: Dedicated chapter for alchemical items and concoctions related to Obelisk materials.\nUNLOCKED!  $7,000: Dedicated chapter for a themed set of items.  Exact theme TBD, but one example is Courtesan's Gear, comprised of items for beguiling, enchanting, illusion, and escape.\nUNLOCKED! $7,500: KS Exclusive Versions: If we hit this goal, both volumes will be delivered in a Kickstarter Exclusive version.  These versions will only be released to Kickstarter backers of this campaign, and will not be available through normal publication afterwards or as part of subsequent KS campaigns.  In addition to an exclusive KS-only cover, these editions will feature an introduction by the authors and a KS-exclusive magical item that will not be available in the published AA1 and AA2 books.\nUNLOCKED! $8,000: Additional Themed Set.  Could be a set of coordinated items crafted by a renowned Healer, for example, complete with Lore, Quests, and detailed NPC breakdowns for the legendary alchemist in question...\nUNLOCKED! $8,500: Additional Themed Set.  Fortune-Teller's Tricks?  Farm-Hand's Prize?  The trough of ideas runs deep...\nUNLOCKED! $9,000: Additional Themed Set, with dedicated chapter.  Blacksmith's Forgeworks?  Mise en Place of Manna: Food-Crafting Tools of the Eateries of the Gods?  \nUNLOCKED! $9,500: Additional Themed Set.  Spells and tools from the Direcaster's Journal.\nUNLOCKED! $10,000: Additional Themed Set, with dedicated chapter: Enchantments from the Brothel Regalia.\n$10,500: Crowdsourced Artifact.  Backers get to vote on the direction of a powerful magical artifact during development!\nAdd-Ons\nAdd-ons will be available in BackerKit shortly following the conclusion of the Kickstarter campaign.\nIf you are interested in any Add-Ons, the best thing to do is to increase your pledge amount accordingly; that way, the total gets considered against Stretch Goal milestones.\n$5: Multiformat PDF: Most pledge levels include the book in your choice of rules system formats: Pathfinder or 5E.  This add-on grants you the PDF in the other rules system format.\n~$25: Upgrade to Premium Color: This release will feature full-color artwork.  Although the standard print used by RPGnow is perfectly fine, some backers may wish to upgrade to premium color for even crisper colors.  Perhaps obviously, this Add-On only applies to pledge levels that already include a hardcover.\n$75: Item Design: Help design an item (weapon, armor, rod, staff, spell, etc.) in the collection.  Includes a full-color artwork dedicated to the item you help design.  Note that this capability is included in some of the elite pledge levels; this add-on can be used to add another custom item if you wish.\n$75: NPC Design: Help design an NPC in the collection who is associated with an item, and/or a Quest related to the stories herein. Includes a full-color artwork dedicated to the NPC you help design and/or name.  Note that this capability is included in some of the elite pledge levels; this add-on can be used to add another custom item if you wish.\nThis Campaign\nThis Kickstarter campaign is an opportunity to enhance the content of Artifacts & Artifice, making it more useful and interesting.  \nInstead of a 32-64 page softcover, the resulting sourcebook will be a 150+ page, full-color hardcover, with dedicated full-color artwork for each item.  \nThe Product  \nIt's a magical-items sourcebook that describes several dozen magical items intended for a broad range of character levels. \nIt's intended as a companion to the Dark Obelisk Adventure Path.  But it easily, and seamlessly, integrates with any roleplaying campaign.\nAll Infinium Game Studio products feature the following:\nGM- and Player-Friendly Formats: Every single map comes in a GM version with full annotation, and a \"redacted\" Players version that hides secrets and references and is just more of a battlemap. In addition, each version of each map is included as a separate, ultra-high-resolution image file, for use with DTT/VTT gaming tools or just to print out at larger size. \nPrint, Mobile, and Print Friendly: Every PDF comes in a print-friendly version with a full-color parchment watermark background, and a smaller-filesize mobile-friendly version with a white background. Check out some examples below.\n  Who Gets What  \nSome DO2 project backers will already automatically receive the results based on their existing pledge commitments. \nBecause they're all awesome, and believed in me early on. In other words, those backers currently set to receive the Artifacts & Artifice PDF and/or softcover will instead receive the expanded Artifacts & Artifice PDF and/or hardcover book at no extra cost. (Conversely, if you've backed a project of mine, but for whatever reason don't qualify for a copy of AA, then you won't automatically get a copy of the expanded book. Don't remember for sure if you do or do not get AA? Just PM me and I'll be happy to look it up.)\nFulfillment Timing & Hardcopy Shipping  \nShipping for hardcopy and PDF fulfillment will take place immediately upon completion and publication of the finished book.\nIGS products are typically developed in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game rules system.  Following completion, the content is converted to the 5E system; this usually takes a few weeks to a month depending on the size and nature of the conversion required.  It's anticipated that with this project, we may be in a position to develop content for both rules systems simultaneously; that's the ideal because then 5E backers won't have to wait to get their results. \nAll product fulfillment will take place via DriveThruRPG / RPGnow; if you're backing and don't already have an account, I recommend creating one. It's free.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNone, really. Man, I hope that doesn't jinx anything. I guess more accurately, time. I can guarantee that it'll be completed, and worth the wait and worth your pledge dollar; I cannot in any way guarantee *when* it will be delivered!\n\nArtifacts & Artifice is already in development, and about 25% of the content is already created. This campaign, if successful, will add a good amount of additional content beyond that.\n\nExtending things will, as I've said, take a bit of extra time, but it's using an established process that I'm quite comfortable with and that has next to zero risk implementing.\n\nSo barring a natural disaster, I can pretty much guarantee this will happen. It's just a matter of how long it takes me to finish!\n\nAs with everything else I do, how long it takes is a function of the competing elements of my life: three kids, a family, a full-time day job, stupid bodily requirement to get more than 3 hours of sleep a night... that sort of thing.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Lurker", "descp": "Get updates from the project as they are made throughout the campaign and product development.

It is unlocked as of now.\nThe Stretch goals are to add additional free dice as of now. I checked the budget and found room to include a die with every physical order. All backers, including Digital backers, who want more custom dice are encouraged to add dice onto their order. Adding them to your order now will help us finish funding and start crashing stretch goals.\nThe new dice will be unveiled in a few days.\nThe City of Talos is an adventure for three to seven characters between levels eight and ten. It is designed for use with the Fifth Edition version of Gary and Dave\u2019s RPG. It can be adapted to any fantasy RPG.\nThe Premise\nAfter the events of The Buried Zikurat, the characters return to the city of Meawold to report to the Minister of Interior Affairs Edmur and enjoy the fruits of their labor. After tiring of the delights of Meawold, and possibly running a bit low on coin, they decide the time has come to accept the invitation from Sherin Po-thole and enter Talos as honored guests, something no surface dweller has ever done. \nWith the characters attuned to the necessary magic items, the party returns to the nexus and follows the signs to Talos. There it discovers a wondrous land of adventure and opportunity: \nFrom the exploration of the nexus, the party saw hints and rumors of lost treasures. \nNegotiation with the Formene Elves will be a challenge. They are skilled orators, and most of them have been practicing negotiation longer than the party has been alive. \nThe dangers of the Formene are many, powerful, and unforgiving. \nThe riches are nearly beyond imagination. For example, the Formene is the only source of mithril weapons and armor. \nSomewhere in the Talos libraries lie the secrets to why Hastur wants the elves for his master plan. \nThe Duchy of Meawold would relish the opportunity to restore trade, or perhaps even reopen the nexus. \nThe first heroes to enter Talos will be known throughout the lands and become the stuff of legend. \nThe Formene Elves welcome an opportunity to sample the delights they know only through legends, cuts of beef, lamb, pork and chicken, not tasted for nearly two millennia. \nPotential Cover for The City of Talos\n  Who is Dark Naga Adventures? Why should you trust me? \nI am Kevin Watson, and Dark Naga Adventures is my company. It exists to create and publish adventures that are a combination of the classic sandbox adventures of the early days of the hobby combined with modern features. I have probably written 30 adventures and designed about a dozen fantasy worlds in my life as a Game Master. \nThis project is the third adventure for commercial release and my third Kickstarter Project. Several others are planned, including two more sequels to complete the Haunting of Hastur series. As a young company, I am motivated to produce quality products and intend to leverage the experience gained from several Kickstarter campaigns to mitigate potential complications in production.\nPrevious Kickstarter Projects from Dark Naga:\nThe Lost Temple of Forgotten Evil\nThe Buried Zikurat\nAs a one person shop, the buck stops with me.

Only the shipping cost will be invoiced. Transparency is important to me. We have opted to charge separately for shipping as part of our effort to provide individual backers with the best value. Every package WILL have the final postage fee printed on the label for verification. A tracking number will be provided when the reward ships. Estimated shipping costs are exactly that--estimates. The final weight of the product is undetermined, but most rewards are expected to weigh less than 1 lb. \nUsing this method, you pay for actual shipping costs only. I pay for materials and labor. If I included shipping in the project, I would have to estimate shipping for each country, and cannot factor in shipping to Chicago is cheaper than shipping to LA from where I live. Additionally, I would need to pad that shipping to account for project fees. By moving the shipping to a separate transaction, I lower my costs, not eliminate them, can offer more shipping options, and the project funding reflects the goods, not the goods plus shipping. \nInternational: International orders will be invoiced at actual postage cost as well. International postage requires customs forms. We are required by law to disclose the pledge amount on these forms. If you are unsure how expensive international shipping can be, please ask us for an estimate. \nOn the previous projects, the domestic shipping averaged about $5.50, and the International Shipping averaged about $18. I am going to collect shipping via Backerkit when I am ready to ship and will invoice for the actual shipping costs. Parcels will be sent once the shipping invoice is settled. BackerKit makes fulfillment more organized and consistent. \n$4000 - Funded! \nThe project is a go. \n$5000 - Custom Talos Dice, d6  \nFor The City of Talos, I made a new custom d6. This one will have a color/ink combination that represents the Formene Elves and Talos. The logo will be updated to include the website. Due to this change, the d10 is discontinued.  \nThe original color/ink combination dice, Blue Scarab Blood with Gold Ink or the Hastur dice, are available as an add-on.  \nAll backers at the Physical Naga level, or higher, will now receive two custom Talos d6 with the naga head logo on the '6' side. Additional dice can be added to the pledge for $2 per die, as listed in the Add-ons section.\n$6000 - More Art\nWe'll add another page of art. One full page or 2 half pages or 4 quarter pages, probably a full page. \n$7000 - OSR and Pathfinder Digital Editions of The City of Talos\nAn OSR and Pathfinder version will be made in PDF.\n$8000 - More Talos Dice\n All backers at the Physical Naga level, or higher, will receive a total of three custom d6 with the naga head logo on the '6' side in addtion to any added on. \n$9000 - More Art \nWe'll add another page of art. One full page or 2 half pages or 4 quarter pages, probably some mixture. \n$10000 - OSR and Pathfinder Old School Print of The City of Talos\nAs a $30 per copy add-on, you can add an OSR print, a Pathfinder print, or both--same as the 5e version, detached cover, color maps on the interior of the cover. This version is only available via Kickstarter. \nHastur Dice\nTalos Die\n Other goals will be detailed later, including more art, additional adventures in and near Talos, etc. \nFrequently Asked Questions  \nI am here to answer your questions. There are no dumb questions. If you don't know and can't find the answer, please ask. I'll respond as fast as my sleep and meeting cycles allow. Always within a day. \nQ: Why should I buy the PDF as part of the Kickstarter when they are a little cheaper on DriveThruRPG/RPG Now?  \nA: What is sold on the OneBookShelf (DriveThru and RPGNow are storefronts for OBS), are the individual versions for 5e, OSR, and PathFinder. And they are $1.5 cheaper there.  \n The add-on or the PDF rewards through this project include all versions. So are a greater value, assuming you have an interest the PDF versions for 5e, OSR, and PathFinder. One might be a better choice for you than the other. Pick the one that works for you. Dark Naga Adventures strives for flexibility in the adventures and in their delivery.\nQ: You say 13 adventures in one part of the video and 12 in another. What gives? \nA: The adventure book has 13 adventures. One of them is a quest aimed at those who are new to the Haunting of Hastur series and want to jump right it. This quest replaces the party playing through DNH2 \u2013 The Buried Zikurat. However, the GM is welcome to use this little adventure in any way they can imagine. \nQ: Can I add a copy of the first two adventures, The Lost Temple of Forgotten Evil and/or The Buried Zikurat, print or pdf? \nA: Yes, you can. Please see the Add-on\u2019s section \nQ: Will there be an OSR Edition, a Pathfinder Edition, and what about insert system here Edition? \nA: I am committed to an OSR Edition in PDF and Print on Demand. A detached cover print will be a stretch goal. I am on the fence about a Pathfinder edition in PDF/PoD; that will be a stretch goal. I am open to an edition compatible with other systems if there is enough of a customer base to justify the work. Options would extend to language editions beyond English. I am looking for feedback on what people want to see regarding systems and languages. These editions might miss the current estimate for delivery.

My work commitments are largely confined to 8 am to 5 pm, leaving nights and weekends to manage Dark Naga. I take projects seriously and respect my backers. Any delay will be disclosed in a status update with a revised estimate for all remaining steps.\n\nThis is my third Kickstarter. To mitigate typical risks, I am continuing the practice of starting this campaign with the adventure fully written. With the adventure fully written, and in a final round of playtesting at launch, most of the risks associated with me as a single point of failure are mitigated, specifically, the risk that I could fail to get the adventure written in the published time frame.\n\nI have advanced the funds for the cover, maps, and most of the interior art (except for the stretch goals). I have some of the art in hand and will be showing some of the art and the maps off as we progress through the campaign. The cartography is done. As stretch goals are unlocked, I will get them underway and update the master schedule. My goals are to control the risks, minimize the delays, and deliver ahead of schedule.\n\nTo provide an additional layer of confidence, I will provide backers a project status update weekly until fulfillment is completed. Additionally, I pledge not to work on the next project until fulfillment exceeds 90% Proof of Delivery. I want to earn your trust and plan to do so by delivering a quality product with solid communication and a high level of open dialog.\n\nI am glad you are taking a look at the project and hope you become one of my backers.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Support Naga", "descp": "Support Naga\nYou want to keep an eye on things, and you want to be in the loop.

It's being released as a series of story arcs providing players with thrilling narratives and opportunities to have a deep impact on the world.\nThe first installment, Crashing Chaos, was launched last year, as a very successful Kickstarter project. \nCrashing Chaos Story Arc - Campaign Guide, Player's Guide & 8 Adventures\nNow, we're back, with the second installment of the campaign - Darkness Surges. \nUnder orders from their liege-lord, the King of the Windsome Chain, players must make the treacherous journey west. They will travel through lands thrown into turmoil, to the great dwarven capital of Hammermuir. \nThey are to negotiate a treaty with the dwarves to safeguard both kingdoms from the army of brutal savages which has invaded from across the sea.\nIt won't be easy - war is raging in the land that they must traverse - and all is not what it seems. Ancient secrets will be exposed, hidden powers revealed, and new mysteries unveiled.\nThe always busy Hammermuir Bazaar. War has increased prices and tensions.\nLike Crashing Chaos, this story arc features high quality writing, original art, complex NPCs, and themes for mature gamers to really sink their teeth into. There's combat aplenty, but players are expected to have more than just a hammer in their bag of tricks. Negotiating, creative problem solving, and sometimes just living to fight another day - all are going to be needed to survive the challenges of Darkness Surges.\nAt the end of Crashing Chaos, characters should have achieved level 6. Darkness Surges will see them through the start of level 8.\n$20 - Darkness Surges PDF\nDownloadable PDF copy of the Darkness Surges adventures.\n$35 - PDF Catch Up \nDownloadable PDF copy of the Darkness Surges adventures.\nDownloadable PDF copy of the 182 page Crashing Chaos Complete Edition.\n$40 - Darkness Surges Soft Cover Book + PDF\nPrinted full-color softcover of Darkness Surges. \nDownloadable PDF copy of the Darkness Surges adventures.\n$60 - Printed Catch Up \nPrinted full-color softcover of Darkness Surges. \nPrinted full-color softcover of the 182 page Crashing Chaos Complete Edition. \nDownloadable PDF copy of the Darkness Surges adventures.\nDownloadable PDF copy of the 182 page Crashing Chaos Complete Edition.\n$80 - Printed Party Adventure Pack\nPrinted full-color softcover of Darkness Surges. \n4 printed full-color softcover copies of the Asatania Player's Guide.

We use DriveThruRPG/RPGNow book printing and fulfillment service and printed books will ship from their distributors located around the world.   \n  We love stretch goals - they are a great way for us to give added value to backers. In our first Kickstarter project for Crashing Chaos, backers picked up an additional 3 adventures, a player's guide, and more artwork at no additional cost.  \nStretch goals for Darkness Surges will unlock one at a time. Each time we pass a stretch goal, we'll unlock another one. Backers at all levels receive all stretch goals.\n$2,000 - Artwork Completion - REACHED\nDarkness Surges has been funded out of my own pocket, which means I've had to be clever about art. I've commissioned mostly concept art sketches and partially completed pieces to show our vision for the adventures and the Asatania campaign world. At $2000, we can commission artists to complete two of the partially done works.\nBackers will vote on their favorite pieces and we'll commission the top 2.\n\"Argenta's Discovery\" - One of many pieces we'd love to finish, with your help.\n$3,500 - Additional Artwork - REACHED\nLet's continue to bring Asatania and Darkness Surges to life! I will commission an additional piece of artwork from one of the artists that's been working on the project. \n$5,000 - Expansion of the Old #7 Mine - REACHED\nThe Old #7 Mine, located outside the town of Ostholme, has more than its share of problems. The war is close by and traders have stopped bringing in much needed supplies. Refugees are coming in though, in droves, and that's putting more pressure on the already limited resources.\n\nA recent discovery at the mine was going to fix all the town's problems, but now, demons are pouring out of the old mine and the few miners that have escaped are telling horrific tales of what's hiding down in the depths. Our adventurers must find out where the demons are coming from and cleanse the mine. \n\nI originally designed the mine to be a short mini-adventure about halfway through the Darkness Surges arc, but, I realized that it could be expanded to be much more than that. If we hit the $5,000 stretch goal, it will be. I'll be able to hire a talented writer to work with me on expanding the area and the depth of its story. \n\nPlayers will need their wits about them to overcome the demonic presence lurking at the bottom of the Old #7.\n$7,500 - Description Unlocks at $5,000 level\n$10000 - Description Unlocks at $7,500 level\n  Darkness Surges is about more than just great storytelling and writing. It is also about great art, great maps, great layout, great editing, and great attention to detail.\nTo launch this project, I commissioned five remarkable fantasy artists: Harito Costas, Tiziana Ruiu, Tenda Spencer, Samuel Amar, and Lada Shustova. Some of them are well known names in the fantasy space, and some of them are just getting their start in the industry.\nDesign sketches from Samuel Amar that we'd love to turn into a complete piece.\nI want them to be able to finish the numerous sketches and partially complete artworks that they've created. I want to commission additional pieces and maps for the book. I want each person working on it to be able to give it their full attention. For all of us, this is a labor of love - but even love can be expensive.\nWe're story tellers and world builders. We believe that the best role playing games are immersive. Worlds should feel vibrant, alive, and real. They should be fantastic, and magical, and unique, but the actors that players will meet and the situations that they encounter should never feel random.  \nWe never want players to feel like the game master is just rolling dice on tables of encounters (even if he is). Every encounter and situation should feel organically like a part of a living world. The more the game master understands about the nature of the world, the more effective he or she will be at guiding the game. \nWe aspire to create layers in our games that will appeal to different types of players. Hack and slash types can go a long way just hacking and slashing their way through conflict. But, we also want to provide clues to the \"whys\" and \"hows\" of events. \nInsightful and curious players will discover backstory and motivational elements which may not be completely obvious. Those insights may help them more cleanly navigate the challenges in front of them.\nFundamentally, our worlds and adventures are about pitting a group of players against their environment. We love nothing more than seeing a random group of players set aside their differences and forge an alliance toward a common goal.  \nIf you share our vision of immersive game play in living fantasy worlds, then please show your passion for table-top roleplaying games by supporting this Kickstarter campaign.  \nHappy Adventuring!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery Kickstarter project comes with risks. We've tried to reduce those as much as possible by developing as much content as possible prior to launching the project.\n\nPlotting is done, playtesting is done, and we've even paid artists and cartographers to get started now rather than waiting for the Kickstarter to complete.\n\nThis is our second Kickstarter project - both set in Asatania - and we've got a veteran group who have been working on it since the beginning.\n\nBut, even with all that, sometimes things go wrong or get delayed.

DiPesa, Erik Frankhouse, Ben McFarland, Jaye Sonia, and Brian Suskind, Bloodlines & Black Magic is a Pathfinder Roleplaying Game compatible supernatural campaign setting that takes place in our modern world. Bloodlines & Black Magic pits rich political elites, desperate cultists, supernatural horrors, celestial powers, secret magical orders, G\u00f6etic spirits, and ancient bloodlines in a deadly war against one another over a reality that nearly all of humanity can neither see nor comprehend.\nBloodlines & Black Magic is Pathfinder compatible!\nHidden from the mundane world, only a rare few individuals ever gain a glimpse of this dimension of supernatural horrors, this realm of human tragedy and desperation, learning secrets that - if spoken in public - would mark them as broken. Aligned with secret organizations or working as individual agents, Bloodlines & Black Magic gives these modern heroes a dark universe to explore, a canvas that is even dimmer, painted in a darker, decayed grey than the colors already coating it.\nEnter a world where seven distinct magical bloodlines - each with its own ties to the supernatural world, positioning themselves in places of power, working from behind the scenes to shape the world in their image. These bloodlines dominate certain hereditary lines, but might otherwise manifest in secret within any area, or any unaware individual. Although these bloodlines only make up a very small part of the global population, they dominate nearly 72% of the globe, secretly running everything from global trade routes to entire countries.\nAn infernal blooded cultist prepares for a ritual...\nThese bloodlines maneuver the shadows of the secret parts of the world:\nFey blooded Delicate and lively, individuals who carry the blood of the fey display strange insights; some even claim to suffer from otherworldly visions of both the future and past. Prominent throughout the Old World, fey blooded individuals often display interests in nature, environmentalism, and history - especially history related to Ireland, Scotland, Gaul, and even some of the Nordic lands.\nInfernal Blooded Cunning and strong, individuals with ties to this bloodline rarely discover the power of their blood until late into their teens, although some don\u2019t manifest their abilities until their mid-twenties. Naturally intelligent, these individuals combine their wit with their strength, outwitting or strong-arming others into following their directions, regardless of their will.\nDragon Blooded Born cold, calculating, and prone to dreams of conquest others can barely comprehend, the dragon blooded are a supremely confident line. Some whisper their heritage is as old as the serpent that encircles the cosmic egg, and although many chuckle at the idea of sleeping dragons, these individuals know all too well their blood is as cold as it is ancient.\nJinn Blooded As passionate and dedicated as any modern dervish, jinn blooded humans have ties that predate the modern Middle East. Their heritage rises from the Assyrian, Sumerian, and Babylonian conquerors who, under a bright, burning sun, worked ancient magic in the earliest dawn of man. Wise and tenacious, these individuals display a resilience rarely found in the modern world.\nSeraphic Blooded Nearly as famous as their infernal siblings, seraphic blooded humans are wise and comely. Many of these seraphic blooded descendants display a natural charisma that reveals their angelic roots, attracting others who simply want to bask in the presence. Attractive to a fault, these individuals display their bloodline in a number of physical ways: bright eyes, angular features, and silky hair that range from the dark of a raven\u2019s feathers to the golden hues of the Valkyries themselves.\nShadow Blooded Of all the bloodlines, those who carry shadow-touched blood are perhaps the strangest. These rare individuals openly display a love of the dark, and many take great pains to avoid the daylight; some of these shadow-blooded suffer from minor medical conditions that discourage daytime activities.\nSpirit Blooded Attuned to a world visited almost exclusively by dreamers, spirit blooded humans have a heritage older than that of any other bloodline. Many claim that their very bodies are the world\u2019s ancient spirits made flesh, while others believe they are the children of the dreaming realms, readily pointing to the Astral Plane as their original home.\nA spirit blooded investigator calls on a favor...\nBloodlines & Black Magic draws liberally from the lore of our day-to-day world, weaving historical facts, modern myths, urban legends, and popular conspiracies into a supernatural world that could be our own \u2013 but only if we had the eyes and patience to pierce the neon-stained billboards which so carefully hides it from our view. Steeped in esoteric lore, popular culture, current events, and empowered by a connected, global community, Bloodlines & Black Magic pushes the boundaries of what we think we know, crashing through the mirror and diving into the deeper parts of the human abyss...\n            A modification of the unofficial Pathfinder E6 system championed by the eccentric and odd minds of Clinton Boomer and Jaye Sonia (with a lot of help from their friends), Occult 7 (or O7 for short) is a new adaptation of that system that combines elements from Occult Adventures, the Advanced Class Guide, Pathfinder Unchained, and dD20 Modern (with a proper nod to White Wolf's original World of Darkness and the games it inspired), combining everything into a simple, streamlined system that eases play and focuses on that gritty, dark modern feel.\nUsing O7 as its base, Bloodlines & Black Magic introduces Pathfinder Roleplaying Game (and 3.5) fans to a darker world heavily influenced by some of the genre's best fiction and media. Mechanically, it gives players a whole new set of tools to play with, including new and updated skills for the modern world, unique character abilities, seven updated character classes (based on classes from Occult Adventures and The Advanced Class Guide), new feats and traits, an expanded library of modern magical items, and a host of new NPCs and locations for GMs to adapt to the world they already know. \nA boy and his dog? Or a Jinn-bound street magician and its familiar?\nBloodlines & Black Magic also introduces players and GMs to several new mechanics, including:\n\n\u2022 Encounter Arcana: Each character begins play with a single trait aligned to an Arcana (a concept). Every encounter in Bloodlines & Black Magic is ruled by an Arcana of its own. When a player's character aligns with that Arcana, they gain a significant boost during that encounter. Bloodlines & Black Magic will introduce 40 Arcana for players and GMs to pick from.\n\n\u2022 Breaking Point: Bloodlines & Black Magic uses a new, unique tracking system to track mental fatigue and stress caused from exposure to the supernatural\u2026 and to unlock new, hidden inner abilities!\n\n\u2022 Bloodlines: Instead of using static racial builds, Bloodlines & Black Magic uses a fully modular point-buy system, allowing players to build individual characters who - even when they share the same lineage - are entirely unique.\n\n\nWhile Bloodlines & Black Magic will be familiar to fans of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, it changes the way adventures are played, and how each play session is executed.\n\nThese differences can be summarized below:\n\u2022 Whispers & Rumors: Bloodlines & Black Magic will introduce a season full of shorter companion PDFs (each between 7 and 11 pages in length), each of which includes new NPCs, new monsters, new locations, new secrets, and new encounters. These will launch in October of 2017 and will last a full year. Each new season will begin the following October (more info below).\n\u2022 O7 Episodes: Each season of Bloodlines & Black Magic will introduce a full season of short, 4-5 hour long adventures designed to feel like episodes of your favorite supernatural or horror television show. Designed to complement Whispers & Rumors, each of these episodes will slowly peel back the veil, giving both players and GMs a better look at the world beyond.\n\u2022 Player Impact! If we do well enough on this Kickstarter, we may implementing a player feedback/support metric, which allows individual groups to slowly change the way the world unfolds between each season!\nAn occultist works his dark magic...\nBloodlines & Black Magic is not for the faint of heart: encounters in Bloodlines & Black Magic are designed to be challenging, making situations that do turn violent that much more deadly - but also making each victory so much sweeter. Your enemies may look familiar, but they\u2019ve been drastically altered, shaped to fit the myths of this new world\u2026 a world that is eerily similar to the one you know right now!\n                                       Whispers & Rumors will be a new, unique way in which participants in the world can influence it (and later on, even shape it)! Designed as a cooperative online/offline play experience, each issue will include the designers\u2019 notes and insights, and will include new monsters, NPCs, locations, gear, haunts, spells, and more! Every other month, one of the designers will dispatch a new O7 Episode (a mini-adventure with 7-11 pages of content), tailored to suit the current Season. Every other month, designers will send out clues, stories, codes, cyphers, and other material intended to help players unlock the first year's major villain. Players can champion one of the seven bloodlines, or if it suits them, align to a particular organization or even specific kingdoms!\nThis is a production mock up of the new book!\nBloodlines & Black Magic is nearing completion. Although we're not completely finished with the manuscript for Bloodlines & Black Magic, we've written nearly 70% of the main book and expect to be going into layout by the end of this summer. We're running this Kickstarter to help add more art to the book, as well as to potentially add more content to it. If we hit some of our stretch goals, we'd like to move it from a B&W project to a full color, comic-style hardcover - with more great art from some of the industry's best names. If you've followed our other projects, you already know Storm Bunny Studios prides itself on its production quality - this project will be no different.\n  Matt Banach has been a freelance writer and game designer ever since he entered the fray by making the Top 16 in Paizo's RPG Superstar 2009, realizing the possibilities of contributing to the gaming hobbies he'd enjoyed all his life. Working extensively with Rite Publishing for most of the last eight years, Matt has authored several serial RPG projects which have become big beautiful compilations, including the high-octane Faces of the Tarnished Souk: An NPC Collection for Rite Publishing's Coliseum Morpheuon, and the Gossamer Worlds Compendium \u2013 a series of alternate realities for use in the mind-bending multiverse of Lords of Gossamer & Shadow (Diceless). Matt especially loves writing prose and fiction; he authored his first full-length novel, Lost in Dream, for Rite Publishing, and is hoping he can do something similar for Bloodlines & Black Magic. Over the years Matt has also contributed to Darkness Without Form: Secrets of the Mimic, Kobold Ecologies, Adventure Quarterly, multiple short works of fiction, and some soon-to-be-released stuff for Rogue Genius Games. Matt's wide-ranging roleplaying experience and inspirations include D&D's Planescape, White Wolf's World of Darkness and Mind's Eye Theater, Unknown Armies, d20 Modern, and Pathfinder. Matt is extremely interested in the O7 system and the Bloodlines & Black Magic setting because they will combine deliciously dark noir, gritty street-level action, and both post-modern and traditional supernatural horror. This is Matt's chance to join old friends and new to help design the game he has always wanted to play.\nClinton J.

He\u2019s excited to be working on Bloodlines and Black Magic \u2013 in no small part because it lets him finally get back to doing something with that collection of books on the occult, world religions, mythology, history, and conspiracy theories that\u2019s otherwise been gathering dust on his shelves for a while \u2013 and looking forward to exploring a new vision of a world touched by ancient secrets and eldritch forces.\nErik Frankhouse has been a freelance game designer since 2003.

I failed miserably, so I formed an alliance with my artist friend Aage and turned my efforts to what I do know - designing and programming applications.\nWe've been slowly developing the application in our free time for years, but now that Dungeon Builder is nearing its completion, we hope that you will help us find the funds needed to take time off from our day jobs, in order to finally finish our map maker.\nDungeon Builder lets anyone, regardless of their art skills, make beautiful, isometric, high resolution maps that look hand drawn.\nAdditionally, if you want to add your own drawings to your maps, all you have to do is drop your drawing and a file with a bit of extra information into Dungeon Builder's Custom folder and you're good to go.\n See it in Action\nIf you're curious, we really recommend downloading our demo and giving it a try. Even though all the features are not in yet, we think you'll be able to see just how amazing Dungeon Builder could be with just a few months of further work.\nIf you don't feel like downloading the demo, you can check out the the video below for a demonstration of Dungeon Builder.\n Project Goal\nIf you back this project, your pledge will go towards doubling the number of art assets available in Dungeon Builder (compared to the demo), as well as completing the all basic functionality in the application.\nIn terms of functionality, that covers:\nSaving and loading maps\nExporting maps as images\nText placement and editing for notes and descriptions on your maps\nChanging map size and orientation\nChanging map background textures\nAdditional selection modes for better editing\nDragging map items to re-position them\nAs for doubling the amount of art available in Dungeon Builder, here's what we intend to add:\nCaves\nCage walls & doors\nBeds and other furniture \nMore building features\nLoads of smaller items to make your dungeons look inhabited and unique\nA look at what's available in Dungeon Builder's demo\n Please note: The floor symbol below the tables in the image above is a reference to the brilliant game series The Longest Journey. To avoid any potential copyright issues, this symbol will be replaced by another similar asset as soon as possible.\n Stretch Goals\nOur vision goes far beyond the initial funding goal. We want to add much more art, make the editor even better, and add a Play mode to Dungeon Builder as well.\nTo make all that possible, we have a lot of stretch goals. For each goal met, your map maker will become even better.\nWe want you to be able to build many different looking dungeons, so when we reach our first stretch goal, we'll add an additional wall type, an additional floor type, and three new door types.\nOur current walls are cool, but wouldn't it be great if you could stack walls to create multi storey buildings? If we reach this goal, we'll add at least two wall types that can be stacked.\nWe'd love to have really cool options for water on our maps, so if we reach this goal, we'll find a way to add \"watercolour\" rivers and streams to Dungeon Builder's palette. The watercolour effect will be reminiscent of the coloured portals available in the demo.\nMaybe we're biased from playing too much Baldur's Gate, but we think it would be awesome to be able to add train tracks, mine carts and large rock faces to Dungeon Builder's art collection.\nWhen we reach this goal, we're going to have a lot of art in Dungeon Builder, so it makes a lot of sense to start adding features that make it easier to find exactly what you want. Adding a way to specify precisely what colour map you want is also a priority, along with adding more background textures.\nThere are certain dangers in placing all our art in its original form right there in the application folder, for everyone to view and edit. However, if we reach this goal, we'll do just that. In order to give anyone who wants to add their own art to Dungeon Builder as good a foundation as possible, we'll include all the art made for this campaign as \"mods\" instead of \"baking\" it into the application.\nDungeons are cool, but dungeons with neat entrances are even better. At this level, we'll add trees, grass, and building roofs to the art collection. \nHaving a map centrepiece, where the big boss or the amazing treasure is, sounds pretty good. So at this level, we'll add three huge \"watercolour\" set pieces, including a waterfall for use with our rivers and streams.\nWhat if we could play our games right there in the application? That would be amazing! At this level we'll add a feature to reveal areas as your players explore them. We'll also add ten adventurer tokens and ten monster tokens to the art collection, add a dice rolling function, and allow the game master to hide certain map notes while printing or playing.\nIf we make it to this level, we'll implement some kind of \"fog of war\" feature, so only revealed tiles within your adventurer tokens' range of view is visible during Play mode. We'll also add 20 more monster tokens and make token movement more fluent by adding a sliding animation.\nAt this level, the simple adventurer and monster tokens are replaced by actual drawings. Do you prefer tokens? We'll find a way to add a configurable token that can be used with your own images. Finally, we'll add multi screen support, so players see a completely different screen than the DM. This will effectively allow the DM to change the map mid-game.\nFor those groups that can't meet in person to play, we really want to add a network multiplayer mode, enabling all the unlocked Play Mode features to be used over the internet.\nYou spoke and we listened: if we reach 750.000 DKK, we'll add a feature to export your maps to a Top Down View, allowing you to print battle ready top down maps for use with miniatures or tokens. Please note that this stretch goal was added after delivery was estimated, so to ensure that we do not delay the entire project if we reach this goal, work on the top down view will not start until we have delivered everything else from the Kickstarter campaign. If unlocked, the Top Down View feature will be added gradually during the two to three months after the release of version 1.0.\nProject Rewards\nCredit\nWe like to give credit where it's due, so if you help us in any way, we'd like to include you in our application credits. If you're the Batman of Kickstarter and would prefer to remain anonymous, you can opt to have an alias listed instead of your full name (or to not be listed at all).\nDungeon Builder\nAll pledge levels apart from \"A helping hand\" include Dungeon Builder, available from our website in May 2017. Dungeon Builder will include everything described in the Project Goal section above, and for every stretch goal we reach, Dungeon Builder will be improved for everyone.\nBeta Access\nCan't wait to start building Dungeons? All pledges from the Beta Builder level and up includes Beta Access. Backers at these levels will get a login to a special page on our website where they'll be able to download the latest Dungeon Builder releases throughout the development process. \nTechnically speaking, the beta phase starts when an application is feature complete, so by that definition you'll also get Alpha Access.\nThe first build available after the demo is planned to release two weeks after the Kickstarter campaign ends.\nSpecify a Map Item\nIf you have a great idea for an art asset, and want to make sure it makes it into Dungeon Builder, the Dungeon Carpenter, Stonemason, Planner, Engineer and Architect levels are for you. At these levels you get to specify a map decoration, piece of furniture, building piece or similar. Items made in this way adds to everyone's art collection, so we'll give you credit in the item's tool tip and in the status bar when the item is selected.\nTool tip and status bar credits for backer items\n  The size of the item depends on the pledge level. To give you an idea of the item sizes, we've made a little illustration.\nAn illustration of the different sizes of map items\nCarpenter (Small): 1 tile\nStonemason (Medium): 2x2 tiles or similar\nEngineer (Large): 3x3 tiles or similar\nPlanner (Huge): 4x4 tiles or similar\nArchitect (Gigantic): 5x5 tiles or similar\nSpecify a Creature\nHeroes, villains and monsters are similar to ordinary map items, but require a lot more work and attention to detail. Therefore, the pledge amount to size ratio is a bit higher for these types of drawings. As with Map Items, the size of the item depends on the pledge level.\nGuard (Small): 1 tile\nCommander (Medium): 2x2 tiles or similar\nLady/Lord (Large): 3x3 tiles or similar\nIndie and Pro Licences\nIndie and Pro versions of Dungeon Builder are identical in to Personal versions in terms of functionality and art. But with these versions, you are allowed to use maps exported from Dungeon Builder in published (print/e-book) material, royalty and attribution free.\nMultiple Rewards\nIf you would like multiple Dungeon Builder licenses, just add the amount listed at the reward level to your pledge amount, and we'll make sure you get your extra copies on release.\nTo ensure that one rich backer doesn't completely dictate the art direction, the \"Specify-rewards\" are limited to one per person.\n About the currency...\nBecause we're based in Denmark, we have to define our goals and pledge levels in Danish krone (DKK).This can get a little bit confusing if you're not up to date on conversion rates, so to make things a little easier for you, we've included the price of things in US Dollars, Euro, and British Pounds in our stretch goals and pledge descriptions. Note that the pledge amount in dollars is automatically converted by Kickstarter (and is therefore not included in the descriptions like euro and pound prices are). Also note that stretch goal amounts have been rounded to the nearest hundred.\nThe converted amounts were all updated right before going live with this campaign, but please note that they may not be accurate at the end of the campaign.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs visible from our demo, the core of Dungeon Builder is already implemented, so the risk of the project failing altogether is virtually non-existent - as long as none of us get hit by a bus, that is. Having a team of two, makes the project vulnerable to unexpected deaths. \n\nAnother risk is missing the deadline. As any developer will tell you, estimating a programming task is difficult, so after estimating the programming completion date (including all stretch goals), we've added two months for pledge extras and stretch goal art, just to be sure we're not underestimating.\n\nHowever, if we reach many of our ambitious stretch goals and then run into unexpected and very time consuming challenges e.g. with networking, there is risk that everything will not be finished by the end of May 2017. In that case, we'll give all backers beta access from the 1st of June until the beta closes and we release Dungeon Builder version 1.0.\n\nFinally, if we reach all art related stretch goals and have a lot of Specify-rewards to fulfil, there is a risk that the art side of the project will not be completely done by the end of May 2017. Should this be the case, Dungeon Builder will release as scheduled, and the remaining art will be included in updates as soon as it is ready.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge DKK 25 or more", "title": "A Helping Hand (\u20ac3 / \u00a33)", "descp": "Our thanks for helping Dungeon Builder become a reality.

Each of the backers will actually receive a slight discount off MSRP for backing this project. We have accounted for this discount in our totals and costs. This pricing also allows us to introduce wholesale and distribution pricing to ensure the terrain can get into as many hands as possible after successful fulfillment of this project.\nWe want to continue bringing our products to the world, not just part of it and in support of that, our Kickstarter is open to all those that would want to back us. We have figured out the weights associated with our products ahead of time and you will be charged shipping accordingly. Due to prior experiences where shipping can hurt a Kickstarter, we will err on the side of caution and round shipping costs up; however, we will refund any shipping overages via Paypal when the actual costs are calculated. We do not want to make any money on the shipping costs, nor do we want to be buried in the costs of shipping. For US residence (any state), we will include any applicable sales tax; however, countries outside the US, please keep in mind any tariffs or VATs you may need to pay on inbound products.\nFor this project, we put special consideration into the timing and have come up with a plan that we hope to be sufficient to meet or exceed expectations. With the exception of circumstances outside outside our control, the molding, manufacturing, production, painting, packaging, and shipping are within our control. All of the pieces are made within the US with US material sources and labor within our own manufacturing facility under our supervision. That being said, we have estimated the amount of time we need based on ramp up and labor capacity, which scales with the project final numbers. Therefore our project will be broken into two distinct parts, initial ramp up and production fulfillment.  \nThe initial ramp up will begin immediately following the conclusion of the Kickstarter where we will create the molds necessary to begin production on the first wave of the Kickstarter. This will be 15 weeks, during which time, we will be creating the molds, securing labor, production, and storage facilities and purchasing the raw materials necessary to fulfill the pledges. \nThe production fulfillment will begin immediately following the ramp up period and will continue until all pledges have been fulfilled. The pledges will be fulfilled based on the wave in which you pledged. As the project progresses, we will post updates along with approximate dates associated with each wave so you will understand where your pledge falls in the timeline.\nDuring production, we will continue to create molds necessary for additional fulfillments and duplicates to speed production, in other words we may actually get faster as we go, just don\u2019t quote us on that. We are; however, about 80% confident on our scheduling, which means ramp up can be anywhere from 13 weeks on the low end to 18 weeks on the high end. As we get comfortable with all the arrangements, we will be able to raise the confidence level. \nThis is our project, simply stated, and we are asking you to help support our process of expanding and growing Legendary Realms Terrain from where we are today to a terrain company that can continue to provide new and exciting terrain to better your gaming experience. We want to bring you new terrain and we have a long list of terrain that we want to create. The Ice Cavern project is the first of what we hope will be many more to come. As with all our endeavors, our success can only be realized through your support and I want to thank you in advance for backing and confidence in us.\nIce Cavern Project Description Over the past few years we, as a company, have been working on learning the intricacies of our processes and what it takes to bring our products to life from the beginnings of an idea to the detail painting and packaging. Now that we have a better understanding of each aspect of our process and we are comfortable with our ability to produce and fulfill, we are ready to move forward to bring more accessories and terrain pieces to your game. We have been cautious and tentative, moving forward slowly, to ensure that our processes are in place and now we are ready to introduce our new line of terrain accessories and Ice Terrain for our first new venture as we look to expand our product line and bring your games to life!\nOur new project is looking to introduce two new lines of terrain to our existing product list, Accessories and Ice Terrain. As always, our main focus is to bring new accessories to the market to allow you to bring your game to life, regardless of your tabletop. Our accessories can be used with your existing 3D terrain or even with your current graph paper and markers to give your game depth and enhance game play. Who knows what your players will think of when they \u201csee\u201d the fountain or statue in the room. In addition to our accessories, we have a long list of new terrain lines to bring to market, the first of which is our Ice Terrain. Our Ice Terrain will bring your imagination to a new world and set your players into the cold reaches that have only been spoken about with awe in passing. Now you can go. This project will also introduce accessories to be cast in Ice to enhance the terrain.\nThis project will help us acquire the start up costs associated with bringing these new terrain pieces to the market efficiently. The accessories are completely new and custom sculpted specifically for Legendary Realms Terrain by our sculptor friend Colin Wessel. The new Ice Terrain will be a combination of custom sculpts and Hirst Arts pieces, as we continue to expand our partnership with Hirst Arts.\nThe initial products being offered in this project will include the first Ice Terrain themed room, a set of five Ice Accessories, and a set of five non-ice accessories. Having learned from past experiences, we are limiting our initial offerings to focus on the goal of bringing product to the market for you. However, this does not mean we did not think ahead. Instead, we have lined up many more accessory add-ons that can be purchased and will be revealed at every $25k mark. If you help us hit those marks, we will bring more accessories to market. Oh and don\u2019t worry, it will be very difficult to make us run out of new accessories, we have been accumulating potential new products for the last two years\u2026\nThe design of this project has put us in a position to be efficient without putting a strain on the individuals involved or undue stress on you, the backers of this project. We have carefully considered our pricing, costs, shipping, and timing for this project to ensure that we will be successful in delivering our promises to you.\nCosts: The costs involved with this project include the costs of material and labor so that we, as a company, can continue to produce our existing terrain accessories without compromising fulfillment of this Kickstarter. Our costs also include the one-time fees associated with creating molds, storage facility of molds, expanding our current workspace to accommodate the larger line of products. Finally, we have accounted for and calculated the costs so that the costs will scale with the hopeful success of the project. This means if we need to maintain a larger workforce, create more molds, move to a larger production facility, secure more material, or order more header tags, we will not be caught off guard with the additional expense. We have even included a catch all miscellaneous expense that also scales with the project, just in case we missed something. We are not perfect but we did try to account for whatever we may need.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n1) Success\nSuccess is a risk and a challenge. Although we want this to be as successful as possible, our planning is not unlimited and it is possible that an overly successful project will challenge our preparedness. We have thought of this possibility and would readily accept this challenge. However, this challenge poses risks in the form of shipping delays. Since Kickstarter is generally an open ended success model, we have done our best at determining the time frame of delivery based on reaching our goal projection. In addition, we have planned for success up to 10x our goal projection. Anything beyond that we will attempt to make up time with additional labor but there is a limit we can increase labor within the physical constraints of our facility. Due to physical constraints as well as the unknown factor of each individual\u2019s pledge level, upon successful conclusion of this Kickstarter, we will re-project all timelines and communicate to everyone. We will attempt to hold to our original promise if we can meet the demand with labor, if not, we will communicate an updated timeline of deliveries for everyone. We may even give some people options of splitting up an order, where feasible.\n\n2) Materials\nAs soon as the Kickstarter ends, we will place our order for materials; however, due to the relatively short shelf-life of some of our materials, we cannot take delivery until we are very close to using the material. This can lead to potential out of stock situations when we need material, which can cause delays. Since raw materials are not directly within our control, the only way to mitigate this risk is to ensure we order on time and communicate to you of any delays.\n\n3) Labor\nDepending on the success of the Kickstarter, we have budgeted for additional labor. We cannot begin hiring this additional labor until after the Kickstarter ends, which leaves us about eight weeks to post ads, interview, and train new employees. We feel confident that the allotted time is sufficient; however, any delays in hiring or training employees may lead to delivery delays. \n\nIn addition, there is a risk that employees may quit in the middle of production. This may also cause delays in production and delivery times.\n\nTo address these risks, we do have some time for unexpected occurrences within our schedule but not so much that we could go without employees. In either case, we will communicate any such issues to you immediately, along with an assessment on potential issues due to the issues.\n\n4) Communication\nCommunication is always a challenge. Everyone goes into a project like this with the expectation that they will communicate appropriately and timely to all the backers but sometimes expectations, intentions, and hopes fall short. We recognize this as a potential risk due to the timeline necessary to produce and ship our product. To help mitigate this risk we want to take two approaches. First, we will assign a project manager after the project is successful. This project manager will be responsible to communicate statuses on a weekly and/or frequent basis as necessary, even if it is to say that we are currently on schedule. The other approach to maintaining communication is you. We want to state it here so you understand that communication does not have to come from us to you. Instead, you have the power at any time to reach out to us and ask us what is going on. Our project manager, along with all of us have the ability to monitor the message board and the emails associated with this project and we have set up weekly status meetings to capture these call outs.\n\n5) Shipping Costs\nThe ability to track shipping costs accurately, separate from pledges will be a challenge. Shipping costs are a necessary evil of our product and, due to the weight, shipping can become expensive. So as to not repeat mistakes of the past and lose money on shipping, we have attempted to calculate the most accurate shipping costs for the pledges and the add-ons. We want to make it clear, we are not looking to make any money on your shipping costs and we will track pledge money separate from shipping money. If we can ship your package cheaper, without compromising the integrity of your package, we will refund your over payment of shipping charges back to you, via Paypal.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Richard Parla\n2 created \u00b7 6 backed\nWe are Legendary Realms Terrain but we did not start there.

Ultimate Bestiary: Revenge of the Horde is not another A-Z of monsters. Instead, we have focused on some of the commonly encountered monstrous races like goblins, gnolls, and orcs, detailing their cultures, environments, and attitudes, as well as introducing a wide variety of stat blocks to suit a range of challenge levels, each with their own unique artwork.     \nBugbears - Ruled by augury and ritual superstition, bugbears are lead by a mixture of mystics and warriors. They excel at silently hunting their quarry, be it deer, troll, or man.  \n\"Tell a tale enough times and the details are sure to change. Somewhere in the thousands of years of telling children not to wander past sundown, or play with fire, or suck their thumbs, folk took to threatening them with bugaboos, or boogiemen, and forgot altogether that the original terror of the night was the, sadly very real, bugbear.\" -Ansel Greer, linguist \nGnolls - Scavengers or hunters, whatever niche gnolls fill, they undertake their role with remorseless savagery. The 3 most common types are the powerful and aggressive plains gnoll, the cowardly and opportunistic gutter gnoll, and the cunning and elusive rock gnoll. \n \"If you see one gutter gnoll, there are two. If you see two, pack your bags and find a new town.\" -Urban words of wisdom \nGoblins - Cowardly and sadistic bullies, goblins are divided into 3 distinct subgroups; forest goblins, stealthy guerrilla hunters and trappers; hill goblins, the most organized and martial variety; and cave goblins, a degenerate and twisted breed living deep underground. \n \u201c\u2018Goblin ambush?\u2019 What next? You may as well tell me to fear an ambush of rabbits!\u201d -Last recorded words of Alric Anaut VI \nHobgoblins - Utterly focused on waging war with other races, hobgoblins are not to be trifled with. Like a plague of insects, their great hosts will consume all a land has to offer, and march its former occupants off in chains. \n \"We shall triumph because we are strong, you shall fail because you are weak. While you idle, we train. While you drink, we drill. While you sleep, we march. You are a rabble, we are a legion. You are flesh, we are steel.\u201d -Warlord Koskar\u2019s speech at the gates of Borselle \nKobolds - Kobolds divide neatly into 2 distinct subtypes. Warren kobolds are kobolds left to their own devices; simple miners and trap builders. When a colony discovers, or seeks out a dragon egg or wyrmling, their society entirely changes to that of the more grandiose and self-important dragon kobolds. ***Content contributor Wolfgang Baur of Kobold Press!*** \n \"So they're dragons, right? But they can't fly, they can't breathe fire, they're not that clever, and they're tiny. By that logic, my terrier's a direwolf.\" -Overheard in the Drake and Griffin tavern \nOgres - Ogres are defined by their violent cruelty, immense strength, and monumental stupidity. They are inordinately proud of all these things. \n \"If you's so smart, how come you's dead and I's not?!\" -Longest ogre sentence ever recorded \nOkiti - Usually a mischievous nuisance in port towns, okiti can prove deadly if pushed, with huge numbers at their disposal and a knowledge of deadly poisons.\n \u201cHuman say okiti stupid, because okiti speak nonsense in circles. Okiti say it is the human who stops to listen, no? So who is the fool?\u201d -\u2018Fights-with-tongue\u2019, okiti ringleader \nOrcs - Orcs revel in chaos and destruction, and their violent warrior culture allows for no weakness. \n \"The trick to fighting orcs is to remember they don't expect to make a second blow. Of course, surviving the first blow is easier said than done.\" -Jana, mercenary, former hobgoblin slave \nTrolls - Immensely adaptable, trolls are shaped by their environment into perfect ambush predators. \n \u201cSay what you will, I liked The Grumpy Old Stone. He gave us something to talk about, a sense of identity, you know? And he kept orcs away. As for him eating that old lady, well, that was never proved.\u201d - Brogdan, miller \n  All stretch goals unlocked from the 5th Edition Revenge of the Horde Kickstarter campaign. Here is what's been added to the book: \nBeasts of the Horde - Two legs good, four legs better! We will add an appendix of beasts associated with the races of the book presented at a challenge ratings, such as worgs, hyaenids. reptilian mounts, and more, including artwork. \nFull Color Artwork - The book looks good, but we can make it even prettier! Every piece of sketch artwork in the book will be revisited and turned into a full colour piece. \nTribes - Need a group of foes in a hurry?

We've got you covered. We will include the necessary information to build a playable character as the races in the book, roleplaying information to suggest why you may have chosen the adventuring life, and sketch artwork. \nEncounter Tables - We know you all like your tables. Each chapter will contain a selection of encounter groups for a variety of challenge ratings. \nLair Tables - Let's talk home decor. Each chapter will include a table to determine culturally appropriate details to add flavor to a settlement controlled by the race. \nLoot Drop Tables - Tasty, tasty loot! Each chapter will include tables for challenge appropriate loot which would logically be carried by the monsters. \nAdditional Artwork - Even more pretty pictures! We will add extra pieces of accent artwork highlighting particular items and objects of importance. \nTrinket Tables - What's it got in its pocketses? Each chapter will include a table with trinkets and intriguing but worthless treasures a creature might have on their person. \nTools of the Horde - What foul craft is this?! We will add a variety of items including weapons, armor, and potions (which do not exactly adhere to manufacturer's specifications. Drinking said potions may result in side effects. You've been warned).  \nLair Maps - Which way leads out of this accursed place?! We will add maps of various lairs for the appropriate monstrous races like cave goblins, rock gnolls, trolls, kobolds, etc. These maps will be in the book, PLUS you'll receive a digital version of every map no matter what your pledge level!\nDIGITAL (these add ons require a pledge of at least $15) \n$5 Ultimate Bestiary: Revenge of the Horde PDF \n$15 Ultimate Bestiary: Revenge of the Horde (d20pro) \n$15 Ultimate Bestiary: Revenge of the Horde (Fantasy Grounds)\nPHYSICAL (these add ons require a pledge of at least $40)\n$40 Ultimate Bestiary: Revenge of the Horde HARDCOVER \n$25 Revenge of the Horde PAWNS - This pack of solid cardstock pawns contains 258 monsters featured in Revenge of the Horde.

It's as simple as that. \n$12 Encounter Deck #1 - Goblins! 52 cards including all three goblin sub races as well as the goblin king! \n$12 Encounter Deck #2 - Orcs & Hobgoblins! 52 cards including a huge variety of orcs and hobgoblins to fill your battlefields! \n$12 Encounter Deck #3 - Gnolls! 52 Cards Including all three gnoll sub races to terrorize the countrysides and city sewers! \n$12 Encounter Deck #4 - Bugbears, Trolls & Ogres! 52 Cards Including some of the most monstrous creatures of all! \n$12 Encounter Deck #5 - Kobolds & Okiti! 52 Cards Including the smallest and most numerous of the hordish races! \nAs shipping fees continue to climb it's becoming more and more difficult to fulfil physical products. Underestimations of shipping fees can seriously impact projects like this, so we are waiting until we are closer to the delivery date to collect those fees.

The kingdom can have but one ruler \u2014 the king of storms. Which child of heaven shall take their place upon the throne?\nAnd who will be consumed by the storm?\nKing of Storms is filled with rules and advice. And godlike beings...\n  King of Storms utilizes an innovative game system called Praxis. In Praxis, players take on the roles of characters and authors of the story, but with one twist. Praxis characters want what's best for them, allowing for semi-competitive play in a GMless game.\nPlayers creates scenes for the characters to push their own agendas. The core mechanics revolve around three things: dice, milestones, and trepidation. Dice determine the outcome of dramatic conflict, in a way that may surprise everyone. Milestones and goals shape the story. Trepidation is all the bad things that can happen when a character fails. Each character has a list of five milestones and trepidations that are specific enough to provide flavor, but vague enough to not pigeon-hole play.\nCharacters are the heart of Praxis. Every piece of the story grows from the successes and failures of the players\u2019 actions. Unlike traditional roleplaying games, where characters are insular until they interact with the environment, Praxis characters are are the environment, protagonists, and story, all wrapped into one. Everything needed to write a story is on the character sheets.\nPraxis comes with six character roles and each role has a unique combination of objectives, quirks, powers, milestones, and so on. These combinations make Praxis stories different every time.\nEach Praxis game is 80 pages long, complete with all the rules, advice, and character sheets needed to play.\nThere are three completed games, with art, ready to print. There is no risk.\nAll Praxis games use the same core mechanic. Players takes turns being director, framing scenes based on their goals and milestones. While game play is semi-competitive, there's also the cooperative need to write coherent stories.\nSo in some ways, Praxis is easier to play than other GMless games. And in some cases it's more complicated. The scene framing rules are the most straight-forward and clearly defined out there. But the character goals and milestones mean that the players need to be creative and think on their feet. In the end, the game experience is familiar, dramatic, and a perfect evolutionary step in the GMless game parade.\nBecause of the nature of the system, new plots and stories can be explored that can't be under other systems. Praxis allows for more stories that point inward in a meaningful way, as well as outward, against the world.\nCharacters, not setting, are the heart of Praxis. Nearly everything you need to play can be found on the character sheet. Role. Powers. Objectives. Relationships. Quirks. World Building. Milestones. Trepidation. No two sheets are the same.\nEach sheet guides you to an unknown finish line, as more and more finale options dwindle away. But only one player can write the finale.\n70 pages of rules and advice guide you through every step of play.\nThree games are done. Art. Editing. Everything. As soon as the project ends, I hit the print book button and ship your game. Don't expect any long-winded updates about the project being delayed. Because it's done. The day the project ends, I hit send and your book gets printed and shipped.\nYou are buying a finished game. A progressive step in GMless games. A project that I'm really proud of.\nI love playing these games.\nDisclaimer: Praxis games contain some mature subject matter. While most Post World Games products aren\u2019t for kids, the material contained in these pages is for adult readers and gamers. No attempt has been made to be overtly offensive, but these games tackle themes requiring a deeper sense of the world.\nThe Lambs is available only through kickstarter. Never to be offered again. It is only available as a book.\n  King of Storms comes with a unique cover for backers. There is no other way to get this image for your copy of the game.\nUnique characters make each game highly replayable.\nAll softcover and hardcover rewards come with PDFs, except for the Lambs.\nEach game will be explained in greater detail in the updates.\nThe Lambs. This game is only available through this kickstarter and only as a print book. A PDF will never exist. Though, PDFs of the character sheets are available. I reserve the right to keep one copy of the game for myself. See below for more on this game.\nYou read that correctly. The Lambs will never be available again.\nFor every $2500, backers will receive one free PDF (of my choice) from my online store. Most likely a Protocol game. But if we go far enough with this, who knows what I'll give away.\nIn addition, backers will receive a backer-only pdf character for King of Storms \u2014 the Guardian \u2014 unavailable anywhere else. So. Unless someone sends them all over the internet, only you will have this character.\nAt $5000, I release a third Praxis game, Odin's Eye \u2014 a scifi search and rescue story. This game will not be kickstarter only, though backers can purchase it early through this kickstarter (ensuring it has top-notch art). It is complete now and will not delay the project.\nThe Odin's Eye Search and Rescue Vessel\nIn addition, backers will receive a backer-only pdf character for Lambs \u2014 Homeless \u2014 unavailable anywhere else.\nAt $7500, I release a fourth Praxis game, Of the Flesh \u2014 a game of zombies trying to become human once more. This game will not be kickstarter only, though backers can purchase it early through this kickstarter. It is complete now and will not delay the project.\nIn addition, backers will receive a backer-only pdf character for Odin's Eye \u2014 The Biologist \u2014 unavailable anywhere else.\nAt $10,000, I release a fifth Praxis game, The Black Monk \u2014 a strange fantasy game about immortality.\nThe Belltower Watcher awaits signs of the Black Monk's return\nIn addition, backers will receive a backer-only pdf character for Of the Flesh \u2014 The Pariah \u2014 unavailable anywhere else.\nPlayers vote for the next game in the series, chosen from a list of 5 possible titles. I will write and kickstart this game at another time.\nIn addition, backers will receive a backer-only pdf character for The Black Monk \u2014 The Lamplighter \u2014 unavailable anywhere else.\nTBD.\nIn The Lambs, the characters are people who believe their god speaks to them through signs and portents. Everything around them is a message telling them to \u201cdo his bidding.\u201d And each Lamb has the power and hunger to make change, if only until they are released.\nThe Lambs are passionate and see the world\u2019s sickness for what it is \u2014 humankind slipping into the hands of evil forces. The only road to salvation is in god\u2019s work and making the world over in a new image.\nPlayers take on the roles of these Lambs, working to reshape the world, while avoiding the corruptive influences of power. As the story inches closer to its inevitable conclusion, one must ask, \u201cwas it worth it?\u201d\nWas the kingdom worth all this?\nThis is just one of many games in the line.\nIn Odin\u2019s Eye, the characters are search and rescue specialists aboard a galaxy-spanning spaceship. They\u2019re dedicated, highly-trained, and often sent into impossibly hostile places. Their motto \u2014 No Star Unturned \u2014 serves as a reminder that they never give up, even when that could spell their doom.\nOrbiting an alien planet, the crew of Odin\u2019s Eye intercepts a distress beacon of unknown origin, squawking from the planet\u2019s surface. Geological instability and fluctuating weather patterns make it difficult to pinpoint the origin. One thing is certain, the beacon\u2019s rhythmic signature is unlike any in the Federation.\nSomething down there is either alien\u2026 or confused.\nIt\u2019s only a matter of time before the planet\u2019s toxicity kills whoever is sending the signal\u2026\nI intend for Praxis to be a 10-game series. Maybe more. But, I won't force it. Two more games are in development. I will only release new Praxis games when I have an idea for one that works. I won't rush these.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThese games are done and ready to print. As soon as the project ends, I tell the printer to make your books and send them off.

As awakened, the men and women of Grimaton are possessed of magic in the form of a special bond with an animal or a knack for manipulating the underlying energies of the land. They throw rainbow fire, swim beside alligators, or shape the blood of their enemies into weapons.\nJoin us for a second time as book, RPG, and game publisher Samurai Sheepdog works independently to bring together seventeen amazing authors. In our latest anthology you'll find tales of triumph, failure, fear, and acceptance set once again in the fantasy world of Grimaton. Enjoy new stories with the heroes and villains from Book I.

After years of hard work, we\u2019ve created a supplementary system for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game that allows anyone to quickly and easily create balanced monsters from the ground up! While rigorously play-testing the system, we\u2019ve produced hundreds of new monsters inspired by all the Bestiary classics and are excited to share both the system and our creations with our fans!\nThe book and 230 monsters are already written and nearly ready to publish, but we want to see this project given the finishing touches it deserves. That means paying for beautiful original artwork, careful editing, and expanded content galore. We can\u2019t do that without your help!\n Want to know how we do it? We've created a \"pay what you want\" PDF that includes  an example of monster creation, and five sample monsters!\nBalanced monster creation can be a challenging and convoluted process for even experienced designers. In the theme of the popular Rogue Genius GamesTalented series, the Talented Bestiary presents new rules for monster construction\u2014taking it out of the realm of guess and check, and making every monster easily customizable. The simple streamlined process allows virtually anyone to produce full monster stat-blocks completely compatible with the Pathfinder system.\n The Talented Bestiary divorces creature type from basic statistics, so you can make a barbaric bloodthirsty fey as easily as an arcane spellcasting ooze. In addition, we\u2019ve broken down every universal monster ability and unique monster ability found in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Bestiary to create an intuitive point-buy system based on challenge rating. With this system, you can quickly and easily create any monster you dream of; from Fine-size CR \u00bd to a Colossal-sized CR 34. \n \u201cI once read a piece of advice that completely altered how I run games. It was in a horror setting, and the idea was simple. Players are a jaded lot that have seen it all. The idea of fighting a troll isn\u2019t scary anymore. As soon as the word troll comes out of your mouth, they roll their eyes and ask who has fire and acid handy. The same goes for hundreds of other monsters from aboleths to yeti. So, do you just throw them away and always look for the next book? \n Of course not!\n If you rebrand the troll, give it a different description and appearance, you can use the exact same statistics. Don\u2019t say \u201ctroll\u201d; say \u201cit\u2019s a hulking reptile monster with bloody saliva oozing from a gaping maw\u201d. The players are now confronted with something completely new, to them. They have no idea that behind the screen you are rolling for a troll. When their weapons can\u2019t kill the beast, they have to rediscover the troll\u2019s weakness all over again. They get the thrill, and the fear, of the unknown. They experience the feeling they had the first time they ever fought a troll. \nYou could even take it a step further! Instead of fire and acid, the mysterious beast can only be killed by cold and electricity. Or as an alternative to rending with claws, it has the ability to swallow whole. Replace scent with tremorsense and it senses vibrations in the water. Throw a template on there! A red half-dragon troll is pretty terrifying. Now we have a completely new monster slapped onto the troll chassis. And the best part is, no one has to know! A monster is a tool used to tell your story. You should never feel limited by the creatures you have at your disposal or be required to scour through multiple source books to find the perfect stat-block. Antagonists should be as mutable and custom-crafted as player characters. If you don\u2019t like something about a monster, you should be able to change it. If you have an amazing idea for a creature, it should only take a few minutes to throw something together from scratch. \nThe Talented Bestiary was created with these principles in mind, and we are proud of the result! We hope that this book lets you scare the pants off your players, and that no two trolls are ever the same again.\u201d -Stephen Rowe\nInstead of having base statistics determined by creature type, we have monster creation based on role (similar to player character classes). So, you can make a sneaky skilled ooze or arcane caster construct. There is one referenced table containing all base statistics (ability scores, base saves, recommended attacks, etc.) for a Medium-sized creature of any given CR.    \nThese values are all based on the Bestiary Monster Statistics by CR table, so everything balances out with minimal book work. Then there is a second table with adjustments to those statistics if you want to alter the creature's size. We've also created a spreadsheet tool that basically does all the calculations for you!\nAll creature types, subtypes, universal monster rules, and Bestiary 1 unique monster abilities are broken down into a point-buy system. The higher the creature's CR, the more points they receive, and the more points they can spend on an individual ability (monsters with combat roles get better base statistics but less ability points). Each ability is modular with enhancements and flaws, so any can be custom-crafted to suit the monster. Creature types/subtypes then offer ability suites for a lump-sum cost, and also serve as prerequisites for creature-type specific abilities. - Stephen Rowe\n Naturally, a system like this required a lot of playtesting\u2026 to the tune of 230 Bestiary variant monsters created by the Four Horsemen (Steven Helt, Dan Dillon, Stephen Rowe, and Tim Hitchcock) and guest designers including Victoria Jaczko, Clay Clouser, and Daniel Marshall. Each and every one of those monsters is included as a part of the Talented Bestiary!\nEvery single backer gets access to the google document with the book's first chapter, a summary of every monster featured in the book, and a free downloadable spreadsheet tool for making monsters lightning fast! While each of these monsters is nearly ready for publication, we are so proud of these crazy critters that we want to give them all the appropriate artwork and presentation they deserve!\n The Four Horsemen are Steven T. Helt (Famine), Stephen Rowe (Pestilence), Dan Dillon (Death), and Tim Hitchcock (War). We believe in providing fun crunch and engaging fluff for players and GMs alike. We are all veterans in the industry, having produced content for Paizo, Kobold Press, and many other top names in the industry. \nThe Four Horsemen Presents line has produced dozens of weekly products and blog posts with our partners, Rogue Genius Games and d20pfsrd.com.

Our creative team is experienced. We've produced dozens of books in the last year as well as played a part in nearly every successful Pathfinder Kickstarter project. \n\nThe primary risk for the Talented Bestiary is one of our key partners being struck by some major illness or injury that prevents them from completing editing, layout, or art in a timely manner. Fortunately, we have access to numerous individuals available for each of those categories should such an event occur. \n\nThe bulk of the writing is complete for the Talented Bestiary. It is currently in editing, and getting ready for layout. We simply want to make sure we get the best artists we can commission, to fill this book with beautiful illustrations and give YOU the best book we can! \n\nThe only outside challenge may be in gathering, developing, and editing monster text from a few backers. Backers who pledge at those levels must deliver text promptly, and it will be developed and edited as quickly as possible.

The tribal leader is dead, the community in tatters, and the future a mystery. What will become of you in this barren wasteland? Who will emerge as both savior and tyrant?\nThis is not a safe game. Characters will die.\nLet's be honest. No one is going anywhere. The world is a shitty place. The sunset over the horizon doesn't make it any less shitty. We can't just pick up and leave here and hope the world is better on the other side.\nIt's still the world.\nIn other words, \"How could Hell get any worse?\"\nThe 'Exodus' is everywhere. Every tribe is on the verge of collapse. Every part of the world is about to fall. But why?\nHow did the worst conditions of human existence get worse?\nAnd what is next?\nThis version of The Carcass cleans up the previous edition. All of the expansion notes and classes are in one place. While the core principles are there, the rules, advice, and structure are stronger. In addition, the rules are being updated to the 5-10-20 in-house game system of Post World Games, including rules for play with and without a game master.\nIn the first edition of The Carcass, the game used a 2d6 system, with charts that reflected the powerlessness of people at the end of the world.\nThe powerlessness remains, but the system is adapting to the 5-10-20 game system, because I personally like it better. It's vastly more dangerous for everyone involved. The Carcass: Exodus takes a second look at the ways we prop up this dying world through powerful effects (and side-effects) of the things we do when we defy the odds. This is best highlighted by the powers in the 5-10-20 system, first designed here for Exodus.\nDisfigurements, mutations, and experience are also more concrete in this edition. You can play with or without them, but the rules for each can have a bigger impact on play. The character questions are better organized and I've added relationship mapping that will look familiar to Protocol players.\nThis edition deals more closely with the Exodus, the Fall of humanity in what might be the final age of mankind. In the previous edition, the Fall is hinted at. No longer. The Fall plays a major role in this edition. Do we try to rebuild? Or do we cut and run?\nThe Fall is not coming\u2026 its here!\nSample Page Spread from The Carcass: Exodus\nSample Page Spreads from The Carcass: Exodus\nThis game is 75% finished. It needs art, editing, and time to put some finishing touches on the writing. It is around 120 pages at the moment, but that's without pagination and all that.\nThere\u2019s something wrong with the world. Not the obvious wrong. We\u2019ve all heard our grandparents talk about the \u2018before time,\u2019 when food was plentiful, people didn\u2019t fight everyday, and there were permanent structures to live under. And there was fuel, too.\nNo. It\u2019s something else.\nI\u2019ve heard rumors from the other tribes. Some suffer from a lack of reliable food and clean water. In some places of the world fewer children are born. Radiation is so thick that people get sick and die within a matter of hours once exposed. Mutations are rampant.\nHope is a distant memory.\nI\u2019ve heard of tribes rising up against their own kind and killing their leaders. And then what? Without a plan, the tribe is cast into chaos almost immediately. Power vacuums create wars. And wars lead to more chaos and death. Some are calling it \u2018the Fall,\u2019 that definable moment in a tribe when everything turns sideways and upside down.\nEveryone is suffering from some kind of Fall. Every tribe, in every corner of the world. At least, as far as anyone can tell. Not that we were ever peaceful beings, but the fall has brought out the worst in us. And it\u2019s growing.\nSome blame the mutants, psychics, and witches. Others speak of outsiders who bring curses with them. Some think there are haunts living among them that brought the fall. None can say for sure what the real cause is, only that nothing is the same.\nIt's only a matter of time before we pack up and leave. Who knows what the exodus holds?\n$10. Scavenger.

See the sidebar for details.\nInformation about all the character classes (called roles) stretch goals will be revealed in the upcoming project updates. At the moment, there are over 20 classes designed. But the roles that make the final cut are contingent upon how well the kickstarter does.\nThe Carcass: Exodus uses a simplified version of the 5-10-20 system that is coming later this year. In this system, players roll between 1 and 5 dice (depending on proficiency and drama points expended) and tabulate the results. Each chart has a value listed for rolling a 0 (below 5), 5, 10, or 20. For each value, an effect is listed. That effect has a result on another chart, explaining how the foil (or GM) will interpret the result. Like so:\nSome results are concrete, and others are grey. The more common the result, the less swing-y the result. Rolling low can result in some really bad stuff with lasting impact for the tribe. In this instance, the Hatchet who rolls less than a 5 is in some deep shit.\nObviously you can't roll a '20' on 3d6, so there must be rules in the game for rolling more dice.\nAnd there are.\nIn addition to their own problems, players need to keep track of their fatigue, wounds, trepidation \u2014 which is a measure of how the community feels about the characters \u2014 and even the community's fear level. Some characters even start with trepidation.\nAdd $25 to your order. This includes shipping. Only available in the US.\nA fistful of dice. I won't count them. I'm just going to cram my hand into a bag and stuff the dice in the mail. Dice come in five colors, with a stylized X for the '6.'\nI can't guarantee you'll get all five colors, but I can fit about 15-20 dice in my hand. So your odds are good.\nIf you want me to take a hammer and spray paint to them to make them ever more \"post-apoc\" looking, I will. But you'll get fewer dice out of it. Just because.\nAs stretch goals, I would like to do the following four decks for the Carcass. These would not be free, but would be available as print-on-demand.\nWorld Building Deck\nA quick-start deck of 30 cards, with random world setup information, including community names, character names, NPCs, conflicts, and even some starting projects. This deck would cut setup time by about 30 minutes. Art forthcoming.\nToolcards: The Carcass\nToolcards are a powerful tool for gamemasters to generate quick encounters and scenarios, in addition to making fast NPCs and effects (like sights and sounds). The deck comes with 30 double-sided cards for nearly endless game options.\nFor more information on Toolcards, see this page.\nCondition/Result Cards\nPerhaps the most important deck of the three, this deck includes all the game effects and conditions for ease of play. The back of the cards will have the game result term in BIG BOLD LETTERS, so it's easy to find. And the other side will have the condition and description for that effect, so players can hold onto it.\nThe deck isn't designed yet, but this is an example of how easy the cards will be to read. This is NOT a final design of the card.\nCarcass Poker Deck\nUsing the art from the game, I will make a poker deck with the carcass logo on the back. Very post-apocalyptic. This will be a print on demand deck of cards, so the material won't be the waxy bicycle plastic cards people are used to.\nAnyone who knows my work, knows that I make games because I love making games. I do not make a living doing this. I do this out of love. Even when those games are about hate.\nThis project is a lite version of the 5-10-20 rules and the beginning of an era of new roleplaying games from Post World Games. This rule system has been brewing in my mind for years. No counting modifiers and arguing about whether or not traits apply to your bonuses. No memorizing \"forward-moving threads\" or working from a spreadsheet to know everything your character can do.\nRoll dice. Look at chart.

Weirder? We've got that covered too, with beasts like the lich hound (AKA \"What the heck are we fighting, and why are its eyes on fire?!\").\nMany of the monsters included in the Tome of Beasts originally appeared in the Midgard and Southlands Bestiaries. These have been re-envisioned to be suitable for all traditional fantasy worlds\nWhat's a monster without a lair filled with danger and loot? Dens of thieves and alchemists' guildhalls, necromancer's chambers, and deep forests of numinous mystery and bloodstained altars.? Ancient tombs beneath desert sands, and warped underworlds damp and foul? \nOnce the core Tome of Beasts is funded, we'll add more monsters and more battle maps via the accompanying Book of Lairs. In it you'll find dungeons, forest lairs, desert lairs, perhaps even eldritch and Mythos lairs. How many lairs can we deliver? That's up to you!\nEach entry in the Book of Lairs delivers a short, playable encounter area focused on a few monsters from the Tome of Beasts or from standard monster sources--and each lair comes with a large, playable encounter map for use with a VTT or projector! \nWe start with 10 detailed lairs, including an Alchemist's Guildhall, Bloodstone Grove, the Umbral Tower, and the Lost Halls of Everforge--including many by well-known lair designers such as Shawn Merwin, Wolfgang Baur, Mike \"SlyFlourish\" Shea, Jon Sawatsky (known for the Prepared! series), and Steve Winter.\nEach battle map is 24 inches by 36 inches for use in virtual table tops, projectors, or printing out full-color and ready for play--the high resolution means great visuals and a rich depth of detail. The cartographers involved are some of the best we know: Todd Gamble, Jason Engle, Alyssa Faden, Tommi Salama, Jon Pintar, and others. We are confident you will love encounters played on them.\nTo make the Tome of Beasts as amazing as we envision, we need to reach a big audience, That's why we've tied several of our biggest goals to expanding the number of backers rather than any particular dollar amount. \nWant to see the Kickstarter rewards without scrolling? Here's a simple chart showing what's what.\n We also have three new options for those looking to use the Tome of Beasts or Book of Lairs with the Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop.

Click on your pledge on the right column and add to your pledge to receive these rewards.\n We have a few stretch goals planned, and we've already hit a LOT of them. Here's what's already added to the pile, plus what's coming up.\nWe want to commission more art than we've ever had in a single book before, and we want to print a large enough print run that we can offer it to some important new bookstores and hobby distributors. \nBoth of those goals require a large financial outlay, more than a small press can handle without significant risk of a huge loss.

We call this new series \"SMArt\" Playing Cards... which is short for \"SIMPLY MINIMALIST ART\" playing cards.\nWe have always loved the look of the Minimalist art style and what you can convey with simple lines, black and whites and solid bold coloring.\nSo what is SMArt Series Playing Cards?\nTo put it simply... it is an ongoing series of \"Themed\" playing card poker decks that will always have that minimalist art style. We plan on releasing approximately 4 decks (or series) a year and each of these decks could have a different theme, but will always have brand new exciting artwork.\nThis campaign (Mighty Super(b) Heroes) is our first release in this SMArt series and it is based on one of our favorite topics here in the office... Super(b) Heroes. From comic books to graphic novels to all the recent great films, there is no denying that super heroes are here in a big way and everyone loves them.\nWe hope you enjoy our vision of super(b) heroes with... \n                                                   Concept by: Steven Fields\nDesign & Art by: Steven Fields & Greg \"Jazzy Bear\" Brown\nReleased by: TwoGeeksGaming\nPrinting & Distribution by: Legends Playing Card Company (LPCC)\n100% custom face cards, aces, pips, jokers, and coloring\nAll 54 cards have their own individual artwork\nEach deck has 2 distinct art styles, Figures & Elements\nCards designed for both right and left handed game play\nCustom Tuck Box\n310 GSM (Black Core) card stock with Linen Finish\nLimited production run\nThe first deck in a continuing series of themed minimalist playing cards\nMighty Super(b) Heroes - Series 1.1 will be produced and fulfilled by Legends Playing Card Company (LPCC), using casino grade black core imported paper stock. \nLPCC produces the highest class of playing cards due to their innovation and attention to detail with exceptional durability, and the \u2018glass like\u2019 edges of their signature \u2018Diamond Cut\u2019 process.\nTwo new decks, Bicycle (left), Legends (right)\nThere have been some great Super(b) Heroes (& Villains), both past and present, that have inspired us along the way in making this deck.\nSo... special thanks goes out to both Marvel & DC... and to all the other companies out there for giving us all these awesome characters over the years. It has been an honor and a privilege to have them in our lives. \nThis campaign is just our small tribute to them for giving us the inspirations you see here.\nOur face cards are the 10's, Jacks, Queens, Kings, Aces, and Jokers. These have what we refer to as \"Figure Art\". \n Our pip cards are the 2-9 and have what we refer to as \"Element Art\". \n We spent a lot of time and went through several versions when developing the card back. This ultimately was the one we decided to use. It works on several visual levels. \nOne of our all time favorite tuck boxes is the Heretic set by Stockholm 17. It is a thing of beauty in its nearly all black design.\nRight from the start, we knew we wanted to keep that minimalist look throughout everything and it made sense to make our tuck box very stark. Bits of color, mostly blacks and greys, and with just enough information on it so you knew what deck you had in your hands.\nTuck Box Prototype v1\nTuck Box Prototype v2\nAll the above pictures are near final conceptual images and represent what the final product may possibly look like. Every effort will be made to ensure that the final produced product matches the conceptual images as close as possible. The art placement onto specific numbers/suits will change for a better overall design. All images/designs are subject to change though.\n Uncut Sheet\nMighty Super(b) Heroes T-Shirt\nAdd-On Pricing List\nPrices include S&H costs. If you have any questions or special requests, please Private Message us.\nWhat do you mean \u201cSMArt Series\u201d theme decks?\nOur goal is to try and release a new deck of themed playing cards every 3 months or so\u2026 as long as there is demand for it. The first one out of the gate is based on Super(b) Heroes. The next one could be something like Sci Fi Movies or even Action Heroes. The skies the limit on these. We might even ask what you, the backers, would like to see in a new deck.\nI noticed that Mighty Super(b) Heroes has a Series 1.1. What does that 1.1 mean?\nQuite simply it means that this is Series 1/Deck 1. So, series 1 will always be the Mighty Super(b) Heroes. In the future, when we do a second deck of all new super(b) heroes, it would be Mighty Super(b) Heroes \u2013 Series 1.2 or Series 1/Deck 2. That way you always know what you have in your hands.\nWhat are Figures and Elements that you refer to on the cards?\nOn the 10\u2019s, Jacks, Queens, Kings, Aces, and Jokers\u2026 we have Figure art. These are super heroes that sort of have the look of mini detailed stick figures. Now on the 2-9 cards\u2026 we have Element art. These are cards that have various elements & attributes of a super hero or the overall feel and look of a super hero.\nWhen there is more than one deck in a series, can I mix the decks together?\nYes. The card backs in a particular series will always have the same back. So you could take Mighty Super(b) Heroes 1.1 and 1.2 and mix them all together. You could even build your own style deck of super(b) heroes that could \u201cAvenge\u201d the planet if needed\u2026 or have a \u201cLeague\u201d of super(b) heroes that deal out \u201cJustice\u201d.\nWhat does Limited Production Run mean?\nWe will only make Mighty Super(b) Heroes - Series 1.1 this one time. It will NEVER be re-printed. The final amount of decks we make will be determined by this campaign. Once they are gone, that is it. \nI see there is a $75.00 tier that has a \u201cLimited Edition\u201d Mighty Super(b) Heroes 1.1 LE deck. What is that?\nIt is truly a unique deck of cards. It uses MPC\u2019s new High Gloss technique for printing. So far there have been about 5 or so decks on the market that use it. But, when you see them, you will be blown away. I was stunned on how beautiful and different they are than anything else out there. Check out this video to see what we are talking about.\nPLAY\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWlwOhTWQ9g\nThe art in the two decks (standard edition vs. limited edition) are the same, but in the limited edition version the High Gloss makes the deck totally different looking. The LE version almost looks like water pooled on the cards. Very cool, very different, very unique.\nWhy is Mighty Super(b) Heroes \u2013 Series 1.2 a whole new campaign and not just an add-on? \nThat is a great question and there are several reasons why we did it this way.\n1. Currently we only have roughly 70% of the art done for this next deck. The extra month or so will give us enough time to finish all the art without being rushed.\n2. If it were an add-on and we were going to ship both together, it would have pushed the delivery time to get it all to you. We felt everyone would like to get things as quickly as possible. You would get the first deck in November and the second in December.\n3. Since were running two separate campaigns, the production houses are giving us a slight discount for repeat business. We are able to pass along those savings to you.\n4. Since it is its own campaign, it gives us another 30 days for funding. The more funds we get, the more cool things we can offer for the cards and deck.\n5. Gives you something to look forward to in the future. When the 2nd deck does arrive in the mail\u2026 you will be like Gollum and the new deck is your Precious.\nHere is what 2GG has scheduled for the remainder of 2015.\n TwoGeeksGaming01@gmail.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe artwork, design, planning, and budgeting has already been completed. Both MPC and LPCC have given their preliminary thumbs up for most everything. We just need to give them the final designs and the funds for production. \n\nThe only risk now is Natural disasters or acts of God... or possibly an unexpected issue with our manufacturer/distributor. Which I honestly don't see happening, as we are only using reputable companies in the card industry. We also padded in an extra month just to make sure we would meet our deadline.\n\nI will post regular updates, so you can keep track of every stage of Mighty Super Heroes and see it come to life.\n\nOnce again, thanks for all the support Kickstarter!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "TwoGeeksGaming\n8 created \u00b7 68 backed\nTwoGeeksGaming was formed several years ago with the idea that all games can be fun.

In time, the Sixth Gun, the most dangerous of the weapons, vanished. \nThe First of the Six strikes with ungodly force. The Second spreads Perdition's flames. The Third kills with a flesh-rotting disease. The Fourth calls up the spirits of those it has slain. The Fifth can heal the wielder from even a fatal wound. And the Sixth is the key to rewriting the world.\nBoth Deadlands and The Sixth Gun fans will find a passel of fantastic new characters, creatures, artifacts, locales, and story ideas for their game in this new take on the Weird West, and all the material in one is completely compatible with the other!

Eventually they will be faced with choices that could reshape the West itself, maybe even the entire world.  \nFor the curious, The Winding Way is effectively a prequel to the events presented in the main comic book series.\nThe Sixth Gun RPG Game Master screen is a tri-fold, landscape screen featuring gorgeous full-color artwork on one side and all the important charts and tables for the game on the other.\n\"More mystery and wonder and adventure in the first six pages than some comics have in their whole lives.

We offer a versatile broad array of alternatives and options for players and Game Masters. The setting focuses on defeating ancient evils, rediscovering of the world of Exodus and geopolitical intrigue based in a magical setting. NeoExodus brings to players and GMs new races and with unique alternative racial options and highly advanced magics that are almost impossible to differentiate from advanced technologies.\nNeoExodus has been described by its creator, Louis Porter Jr, as his fantasy love letter to the science fiction masterpiece, Babylon 5. Others have compared the mixture of fantasy and science fiction elements to be similar to those found in cult classic cartoon series like He-Man and the Master of the Universe to Thundercats and CrossGen comic books Scion and Sojourn. Some of the realistic aspects and feelings of the setting of NeoExodus are based off of real world events while embracing the possibilities for fantasy.\nLouis Porter Jr. Design\nNeoExodus was created, implemented, expanded and developed by many of the most well know Pathfinder Role Playing Game developers including Neal Bailey, Thomas Baumbach, JP Chapleau, Joshua Cole, Richard Farrese, Lee Hammock, Jeff Lee, Jonathan Palmer, David Ross, Amber Scott, Owen K.C. Stephens, Adam Wells, Benjamin Wenham, Linda Weygant-Robison and myself, Louis Porter, Jr.\nWhat is your money going to?\nWhat we have created, at the most basic of levels, is an update and revision of our NeoExodus Campaign setting. This new book will be at least 175 pages in length for this unique setting. The money that we raise will go for the additional cost of generating art, new written material and editing, and the general updated quality of production of the product. Louis Porter Jr. Design\u2019s goal is to present you with a complete and unique world for NeoExodus in the similar tradition of TSR and Wizard of the Coast's fan favorite campaign settings like Dragonlance, Forgotten Realms and even the more unique setting of Ebberon. As we reach our currently planned stretch goals, we will be attaching all new ones to this project to bring on even more excitement and prestige.\nAs we reach our currently planned stretch goals we will be attaching all new ones to this project to bring on even more excitement and prestige to this project.

And then the Empire goes silent. Unlocks when funding reaches $200,000.\nShadow of the Demon Lord is a roleplaying game of dark fantasy\u2014a genre that weaves elements of horror into a fantasy world. In the game, you create and play characters struggling to survive in a land sliding toward oblivion, a place infested by demons, roaming mobs of undead, strange magic, unhinged cultists, and all in the ruins of the last great empire of mankind. If you love Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay, the Ravenloft and Midnight settings, Joe Abercrombie\u2019s The First Law series, Glen Cook\u2019s Black Company books, or heavy metal music, then this is the game is for you.\nThe game takes place in a world standing on the brink of the apocalypse.  What is the cause? Who is responsible? The Demon Lord, of course! This being of staggering power and boundless evil authors the catastrophes blighting the landscape. Each new horror released reflects the Demon Lord's approach, the touch of its shadow, and its growing hunger for not only the planet but the entirety of all things. Although near, the Demon Lord remains outside the cosmos, rattling the cage of its prison as it strains to escape the Void to visit catastrophic destruction to your world.\nThe apocalyptic tone is on a dial. If you don\u2019t want to blow everything up right away, tune it down low and the game plays fine as a less perilous, dark fantasy roleplaying game. But if you are inclined to crank up the volume, the game provides several catastrophic templates you can use to model how the world is falling apart. These templates represent the Shadow of the Demon Lord; wherever the Shadow falls, chaos and upheaval are born. The Shadow might loose global pandemics, famines, droughts, earthquakes, demon princes to stomp across the countryside, the living dead, and other world-spanning disasters and threats.\nThe game system helps you tell interesting and exciting stories. To make this happen, the game system is easy to learn, plays fast, and requires little preparation to play. All these ensure both novice and veteran players can enjoy the game together. Here are a few ways the game met its goals:\nEasy to Learn: The GM decides if a character\u2019s action happens, doesn\u2019t happen, or might happen. If it might happen, a roll of the die determines the outcome. You use the core mechanic to resolve any task, whether you're punching a demon in the face, trying to kick down a door to get away from that demon, or dodge the vomit it spews from its mouth.\nYour character develops with the story. Each time your group completes an adventure, the group's level increases. Each increase adds cool stuff to your character. You might learn spells, a trick with a weapon, or some thing else that might help you survive. All benefits you gain come from the paths your character follows. The first adventure you play through helps you decide the first path you will choose. If you spend a lot of time fighting, you might become a warrior. If you cast a spell from a tome bound in human skin and barbwire, you might become a magician. At higher group levels, you choose additional paths that might extend previous choices or take your character in all new directions. You can choose any path you like so you can play the character you want to play.\nPlays Fast: Stories (adventures) are playable in one game session lasting from 3 to 5 hours. Stories are short, covering about one page per hour of expected play. You can also complete a typical campaign (a string of 11 connected adventures) in 11 game sessions. The core book has rules for playing characters up to level 10. This means that if you meet once a week for a 4-hour session each time, you can complete your campaign in about two months. That\u2019s six campaigns a year!\nThe benefit of short campaigns is that the game lets you tell more stories, create more characters, and experience more of the game's options. As a player, you\u2019re not locked into one character for one year or longer. You can have several. And, as a Game Master, it is possible to run a complete campaign in a compressed time span. Best of all, the campaign brevity gives other interested members of the group a chance to become the  Game Master.\nLittle Preparation: You can make a starting character in about 5 minutes. You make one big choice, note the information on your character sheet, and you\u2019re ready to go. And a Game Master can prepare for a game in the time it takes to read a couple of pages of text. \nIf you'd like more information about the game design, please visit schwalbentertainment.com. There, you\u2019ll find news about the game, design diaries, and much more! \nThe game\u2019s complete and ready to move into production. I spent most of 2014 writing, designing, testing, developing, and putting the game in front of hundreds of people. Now I need your help getting Shadow of the Demon Lord into the hands of my editors and then into layout, through printing, and onto your gaming table. It\u2019s ready, but I need your help to make it happen. Backing this campaign will make Shadow of the Demon Lord a reality. Here's a fun graphic that shows you the backer levels:\nOnce we hit the funding goal, unlocking stretch goals add value to your pledge.

Make sure you tag your contributions with #SOTDLKS!\nFollowing Monte Cook Games' lead, we\u2019re not locking you into a single shipping method. Instead, we're offering you some options. All print books include a shipping allowance. This amount covers basic shipping in the United States. So if you\u2019re good with basic shipping, you shouldn\u2019t have to pay a penny more.\nYou can, however, choose a different option. When it\u2019s time to ship your rewards, we\u2019ll ask you how you want your book(s) shipped. You\u2019ll be able to choose a faster or more trackable method, though it will likely cost more. If your shipping allowance doesn\u2019t cover it, you can pay the difference at that time.\nInternational backers have the same options, but the final cost of even basic shipping will require additional payment. As with domestic backers, you choose your shipping method, apply the credit, and cover the difference.\nI'm using Backerkit to manage fulfillment. So if you choose print options, you will get information from them about selecting your rewards when the Kickstarter wraps.\nIf you have surplus bucks from your shipping credit, you\u2019ll be able to apply the remainder to anything else you\u2019d like from the Demon Lord store.\nLast, the estimated delivery date is for the Shadow of the Demon Lord game. Some rewards might come earlier, and some will arrive later.\nAVATARS!\nYou can also help spread the word by grabbing one of these awesome images and using it as your profile pic (and driver's license pic)!\nSpecial thanks to Matt Marson and Larry Howe for filming and assembling the video, Trey Call of Dirty Proper for the music, Dan Heinrich and Andrew Follett for the character sheet, Elizabeth Peterson for the logo, Patrick Parker and Chris Sims for graphics, Hal Mangold for layout, Jared von Hindman for the achievements art, Ivan Dixon and Svetoslav Petrov for the amazing art, and everyone else who helped get this campaign up and running!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI waited to launch this Kickstarter until the game was written for a reason. I am cautious. I didn\u2019t want tragedy, writer\u2019s block, being hit by an asteroid impact, madness, or corruption to interfere with the design. Since I'm here and giving you a chance to pre-order this sexy game, this means the game is written, tested, and ready to go into the final stages of production. These stages include editing, layout, art acquisition, printing, and shipping the printed products into distribution. Though I am using the very best people in the business and I am confident we'll sail through these stages laughing all the way, things happen. To mitigate the risks, I have backup people in place just in case an editor gets sucked into a black hole or an artist decides to change careers mid-way through the project.\n\nThe biggest challenge is fulfillment. The difficulty fulfilling the Kickstarter rewards increases with its size. I will handle shipping the rulebooks to backers with the help of my dear friends and family. Digital products will be available as soon as they\u2019re done. And if we unlock additional print products via stretch goals, they\u2019ll be out as soon as we get them done. \n\nBefore launching this Kickstarter campaign, I received a physical and discovered that I am in fine health and in no danger of succumbing to natural causes between now and the end of the year.

Players take turns drawing cards until someone draws an exploding kitten and loses the game. The deck is made up of cards that let you avoid exploding by peeking at cards before you draw, forcing your opponent to draw multiple cards, or shuffling the deck.\n\nThe game gets more and more intense with each card you draw because fewer cards left in the deck means a greater chance of drawing the kitten and exploding in a fiery ball of feline hyperbole.\nThe game was created by Elan Lee (Xbox, ARGs), Matthew Inman (The Oatmeal), and Shane Small (Xbox, Marvel).  We think this game combines all the things we're best at creating, and and put together this Kickstarter campaign because we can't build this without you.\nSo if you're into card games or laser beams or weaponized enchiladas, please help us make this game a reality.  We think you'll love it as much as we do.\nHugs and enchilada kisses, \n-Elan, Matt, and Shane.\nThe Origin Story\nExploding Kittens started when Shane Small proposed a game to Elan Lee where a joker was inserted into a deck of cards and they took turns picking cards until the joker came up. It was called \u201cBomb Squad\u201d and it wasn\u2019t any fun at all.\nOver the next few weeks, two important things happened: First, after neglecting work, family, and a social life, Shane and Elan developed a rule-set that started working and brought the game to life. Second, Matt Inman saw the game, thought it was super fun, and asked to join the team. (btw, if Matthew Inman ever asks you if he can join your team, the answer is \u201cHELL YES\u201d.)\nWe changed the name to \"Exploding Kittens\" and our little team was born.\nBUT YOU'RE BLOWING UP KITTENS! NOT COOL, BUDDY.\nWe struggled with this a lot. We love the name Exploding Kittens, but we don't want to hurt kittens. We also don't want the kittens to be hurt by anyone else. Eventually we decided to explore the concept of the kittens blowing themselves up.\nFirst, Matt tried drawing the kittens as the actual bombs:\nBut that felt too Angry Birds\u2019ish.\nNext, we tried making the kittens suicidal, but that felt terrible.\nIn the end, we realized that everyone understands feline shenanigans, and that could be our solution.  Our kitties would not blow up out of malicious intent or negligence, but by doing the things that kittens do, like running across keyboards or chewing on things they shouldn't be chewing on.\nFrom there, the rest of the cards fell into place, and the cards used to defuse the exploding kittens were items you'd use to defuse regular kittens.\nHELP US BUILD THIS GAME\nWe wanted to put this project on Kickstarter because it's the fastest way for us to get the game into your hands and make improvements as a community.  We think this game is great, but we need your help making it even better.\nSo, if a world full of weaponized pork missiles is a world you want to live in, please back this project and help us build this game. \n\nWith love and pork missiles,\n-The Exploding Kittens Team  (Matt, Elan, and Shane)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor more information about the game: http://www.explodingkittens.com\n\nFollow us:  Facebook  Twitter\n\nMusic: Royalty-free music from Bensound.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProduction of the game is simple: it's just a card game, so other than building the box it's a relatively straightforward product to make.

Want your name? Done. Want your favorite pic? Send it over!\nDesktop CNC Machine\n History:\nWhile I was at GenCon this year, I noticed there were a lot of people...duh. What I also noticed that VERY OFTEN people would take any space available to play a game and most of the time those games involved dice. \nVersion 1.0\nWhen you're talking about dice in a cramped environment, it can get pretty difficult to keep your dice under control and on the board. Not to mention keeping them separate from the rest of the players in the game. Of course, then there's also the inevitable dice-rolling-off-the-table-and-awkwardly-rolling-under-someone's-seat-where-you-have-to-climb-under-and-look-like-a-perv-whilst-retrieving-them moments of which no one is a fan.\nEnter the KBOX short (very short) for Kobold Company Dice Box. My idea was to take advantage of that limited space by essentially making a small table you could both carry your dice IN and roll your dice ON in order to avoid those embarrassing, dice-dropping moments. \nMy first version of the KBOX KBOXwas an open-topped box with a whiteboard in it. Players simply roll the dice inside the box, no fuss, no muss...with the SUPER CONVENIENT whiteboard backing, players can also keep track of variables in the game they are playing.\nNo more of this write and erase on a single sheet of paper...NO, NO! The KBOX allows you keep all of this in a compact location. But what happens when you're done with the game? Version 1 of the KBOX essentially becomes another (albeit very light) obstruction in your backpack. Dice couldn't actually be stored in there, because of its open top.\nEnter Version 2.0!!\nVer 2.0 adds a slide-out top to the box! Which, incidentally, adds a SECOND whiteboard to the box as well. Keep track of stats, maps, notes, anything you want without wasting paper. When you're done with your game, slide the lid back into the box and keep your dice stored when you're on the go!!\nTwo of the possible color schemes for the K-Box\nThe events leading up to designing this box have been memorable to say the least. Travelling out to GenCon was freaking awesome! I do some freelance writing for Total Party Kill Games and was out visiting with those guys when the idea struck me. Also, I chopped up my thumb pretty good on the tablesaw - you can probably catch a glimpse of my bandage in the video - My wife has been very supportive up to this point, but in order to move forward, this Kickstarter has to be successful or it'll most likely be a no-go for her!\nSo there you have it! Thank you again for checking out this Kickstarter and I really look forward to chatting with you as this project moves forward!\nSTRETCH GOAL!\n$2000 - We'll upgrade the CNC mill to a Laser CNC for extreme precision and cuts!\nLaser Engraver at the $2000 stretch goal!\n$4000 - A larger, faster production mill is available at this backer level! We'll be able to construct KBOX extremely fast (and accurate)\nCan we even THINK about making it to $4000?\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenge I have right now is repeatability on the individual boxes. While each product is professionally cut and assembled, I do not have a very good method of mass production which is where this project comes into play! \n\nI am looking to YOU, the awesome Kickstarter base to help me surmount that hurdle with a few new pieces of equipment in my shop. \n\nOnce I have some of these pieces, I'll be in a much better position to crank out the K-Box on a larger scale and get them to you much faster!\n\nA successful Kickstarter Campaign here means that production output becomes a reality!\n\nAs with many KS campaigns, what would really be the biggest problem would be too much funding - As it stands now, I would be unable, for example, to meet the demand in my little shop if I were to sell 1,000 k-boxes. I would have to outsource the idea and that would add to the delivery timeline. \n\nI don't anticipate that being problem, but you never know.

Simplicity.  Morningstar.\nWe live in a magical age.  The technology to build Morningstar didn't exist two years ago.  Now, we can integrate all the components of a complex role-playing game into a single application that can be run on your tablet, laptop or phone. \nEverything about the game is at your fingertips from rulebooks, adventures, characters, and maps to the most specific character customization - even a hard-earned badge from an epic homebrew campaign.  Tracking campaigns and compiling logbooks are no longer chores, but an integrated, shareable experience. And game night is streamlined.  Rules lookups are instantaneous - the right information is at your fingertips.  Sharing of content, maps and secret notes is a single tap away.  Spend more time role-playing and less time rules-playing.\nWe firmly believe that the best adventures are sitting on the shelves and in the minds of passionate players and game masters like you.  We are publishers by trade.  Morningstar is designed to allow writers to publish and get paid for their creativity and imagination.\nSince the beginning, our design has been fueled by your feedback.  Morningstar will continue to grow and evolve based on what our community most desires.  Our commitment is to integration, simplicity and creativity.  To accomplish this, the initial release of Morningstar includes 7 closely-integrated modules as described below.\nThe First Six Modules.\nThe first release of Morningstar, launching in April 2015, will feature six modules that unlock the potential of tabletop roleplaying by immersing players in the storytelling aspects rather than in bookkeeping and rules checking.\nPlayers will be able to quickly create and manage characters, track the progress of their adventures, send secret messages, roll virtual dice and more.  GM\u2019s will be able to manage adventures, track encounters, share maps and notes as well as organize large scale campaigns all through a cleverly designed mobile interface.\nMost importantly, our Library will be packed full of purchasable content written and submitted by homebrew and indie authors.\nThe Seventh Module.\nBut this only scratches the surface of what we have planned for Codename Morningstar.  In July 2015, we will release our seventh module, which we call \u201cThe Forge\u201d.

While this change is exciting, it is also challenging. The most significant risks to the project are delays brought about by our commitment to an open design policy. During the initial 12 months of development, our alpha and beta users proved invaluable in improving the game play features of Morningstar. This process produces the highest-quality product. However, it also introduces the possibilities of delays as we incorporate new features for a better overall experience.

It takes a world you think you\u2019ve read about before and turns it into something new and totally different.\nThis is the finest time to be a tabletop roleplayer since the dawn of the industry. With so many great choices on the market, your imagination has nearly infinite paths for which to choose and expand upon. With the recent release of the newest version of Dungeons & Dragons, players are chomping at the bit to exercise their imaginations and spread their ideas wide. With the Seventh Crown roleplaying game setting and future sourcebook line, you can do just that. Seventh Crown is a narrative setting and sourcebook that can be used with the rules found within many popular roleplaying game systems.\nCover of Seventh Crown Setting Book\nWelcome to Seventh Crown\nBased initially within the heavily populated continent of Kanis, Seventh Crown is a setting that places the players in the middle of an epic time of change in a world controlled by a select few. What was once a powerful dwarven empire now stands as broken racial kingdoms not defined by borders or territories, but by the ironclad magical control bestowed upon them by the crowns upon their brow.\nIn Seventh Crown, six golden artifacts of unfathomable power \u2013 the Crowns of Leadership \u2013 give almost ultimate and untested influence over those of the same race. While wearing the Crown, they cannot help but be king or queen of their people. This has led to a world of kingdoms that are not defined on maps or in war rooms, but instead by the blood that runs in a people\u2019s veins. Authority enforced by magic across countless miles creates alliances, enemies and conflicts unlike those found anywhere else. When the reason for going to war is as simple as the will of who wears the Crown and the battlefield could be as complex as anywhere its people tread, life is a complex thing.\nThese six Crowns are the most powerful and important pieces of antiquity found anywhere in this world, and are watched and sought after by most of the people in Kanis. The dealings of the Crowns and the choices made by those who wear them are the talk of every town and city, and entire lifetimes have been spent trying to place a Crown on someone\u2019s head \u2013 or remove the head currently wearing one. Territorial governments, the constabulary, organized crime and other local powerhouses rule their corners of civilization for the most part, but everyone feels the pull of the Crown bearers\u2019 schemes and machinations.\nIt is the rumored existence of a seventh Crown of Leadership, the namesake of the game setting itself, which drives some people to scour the world for the mythic artifact. There have been six ruling forces on Kanis for thousands of years, many of which changing hands (heads?) over and over again, but the fact that there have always been six has been a constant for as long as the Crowns have existed. The discovery and donning of a seventh Crown of Leadership would change the world in an instant\u2026 or the discovery that it has already been found, and by what.\nThe continent of Kanis is large and varied in respect to the peoples that inhabit it, the history they have survived, and all of the interactions in between. Depending on the where someone is from, which King or Queen they serve willingly or otherwise, and how they plan to fill their purses or bellies day to day \u2013 that is where adventure will spring from in Seventh Crown.\nThe Surface of Kanis\nWhat is Different?\nAnyone can read through the newest game system and see what each creature, species or deity means to a \u201cnormal\u201d campaign setting. Seventh Crown takes a lot of these standard ideas found in several rulebooks and turns them into brand new ideas that come together to create a new and unique world where players can portray characters like they never have before. There are plotlines and narrative hooks found within Seventh Crown that will put players in unique new roles as well as give them interactions with the world not commonly possible in other settings.\nJust to give a number of good examples, the following are all samples of what makes Seventh Crown unique, interesting and a great deal of fun in which to roleplay.\nThe current King of the Elves is a sadistic dark elf warlock with the long term plan of breeding out the surface elves by forcing hospitality between the Surface World and the Great Beneath. Over the centuries dark elves have become a much more accepted sight on the surface, and travel to the depths of the Great Beneath is more commonplace despite its inherent dangers.\nThe halfling people suffered massive losses during a horrible war that forced their people into nomadic, extended families that travel Kanis in search of joy, profit and adventure. Their stories and culinary crafts are welcomed almost universally in Kanisi civilization.\nIcon of Vimbre Po; Laughing God of Halfling Nomads\nThe dragonborn of Kanis are primarily mercenaries and seafarers, with those of chromatic heritage leaning toward life as sell swords or pirates; metallic dragonborn finding more favor as professional soldiers and trading corsairs. The two sects of dragonborn are constantly at odds, and many conflicts have begun based solely on \u201cscale color.\u201d\nOne corner of the continent is currently dealing with a large scale guerilla war between the goblinoids and the kobolds, putting some local civilizations in strange circumstances for unlikely social situations and alliances.\nThere is a militant sect within the dwarves that harken to the days when their bloodlines ruled the entire continent as a royal Dynasty. These dwarves are old-minded, somewhat racist toward certain peoples, and belligerently aimed at returning the dwarves to former glory.\nThe gnomes of Kanis are willingly subservient to dwarves and have been for thousands of years. Their acceptance of a lower station in life is a key element to a larger meta-mathematical equation that their ancient scholars believe will finalize with the gnomish people ruling the entire world. Effectively, the gnomes believe they have discovered the formula for complete domination of Kanis; it only requires a few more centuries of servitude to come to fruition.\nAnd much, much more!\nSymbol of Foeslen, God of Thieves and Muggers\nWhat will be in the Seventh Crown core book?\nThe Seventh Crown core book, the goal of this Kickstarter, when published will be a hardcover tome of roughly 150 pages written, designed, illustrated and laid out by industry professionals to create a complete sourcebook for the continent of Kanis and the Seventh Crown roleplaying game setting. While it will contain some rules information specific to the Seventh Crown setting, it will NOT include a core system of rules. Instead it relies upon the player(s) to use it alongside obviously compatible rules systems.\nThe Seventh Crown Core Setting Book will include:\nA detailed History of the continent of Kanis, its many Cultures and its current Rulers\nA detailed Pantheon of Kanisi deities, including their effect upon Clerics, Paladins and Druids in Seventh Crown\nA detailed look at the Geography and Civilizations of Kanis\nNew Kanisi Backgrounds, Feats and Spells\nFull Color Unique Illustrations throughout\nFull Color Maps of the Kanis surface world and the subterranean Great Beneath\nNarrative Stories set in the world of Seventh Crown (some starring characters from higher-level Backers!)\nPlot Hooks and Adventure Ideas; including two detailed 1st-level Campaign Starters\nA Glossary of Seventh Crown terms to help with pronunciation and explanation\nWhat do you get for your backing?\nAside from being a part of the launch of a great new game setting, hopefully giving it enough fan backing to begin a full Seventh Crown line of sourcebooks and such in the near future, you faithful backers can get some really awesome rewards for helping us get off the ground!\nThe Copper Piece Level \u2013 For just $2 or more you throw in your attentions to the campaign and help keep the Kickstarter \u201cHot Picks\u201d eyes peeled on our little project here.

During these events we will be taking charitable food donations (Canned and sealed-boxed items only) from the players AND bystanders to be given to the local Food Finders Food Bank (http://food-finders.org/) to serve as points of Inspiration to modify the game in progress. The catch is that while the players can donate their food products to play as Inspiration for their own characters during the game, bystanders can donate food products to either help out the Player Characters OR give Inspiration for the rolls made by the DM! No matter who is getting the Inspiration played for them, Food Finders will be the true winners in the event.\nThe Platinum Piece Level \u2013 If you are one of the limited backers at the $100 level, you receive an electronic PDF copy of the Seventh Crown Core Setting Book, special thanks in the final product, access to Add-ons, all unlocked Stretch Goal Bonus Products, and a printed hardcopy of the Seventh Crown Core Setting Book signed and personalized by the author and lead artiste.

Perfect for map-based encounters or simply to show off to your fellow gamers, you will work with Bryan to describe the character well enough to have it professionally sculpted and take its place as one of the first products in the Seventh Crown RPG Miniatures line! (Expect some slight delay after regular products ship for the miniatures to be released due to time, talent and resources needed.)\nIMPORTANT NOTE: All shipping costs within the continental USA are included with the backer levels, with additional US shipping showing under each Add-on. For backers/purchasers outside the continental USA, there is an additional $15 shipping charge to handle international postage.\nPre-Miniature \"Green\" for Shrevak, Copper Dragonborn Bosun\nThe Future of Seventh Crown\nOur hopes with this Kickstarter are not just to create a single publication to release Seventh Crown \u2013 we have much, much more in the works for this setting. Should this campaign go well enough to show us a solid fan base in the works, we plan on getting Seventh Crown print runs into common distribution and hopefully into game stores all over the world.\nAdditionally, we have plans to write a series of Seventh Crown setting products that will better flesh out the world, its many plotlines and some major events that take place in the overarching story and expanding world setting.\nSome of the products we have planned are as follows:\nvarious Adventure Modules that cover specific plot arcs important to the Seventh Crown storyline\nBestiary of Kanis Sourcebook; introducing numerous native species of creatures to encounter\nFarsteader\u2019s Atlas Sourcebook; a guide to the lands beyond the primary continent of Kanis\nSeventh Crown novellas surrounding epic events within the world\nEssentially, we want this Kickstarter campaign to go well enough to warrant making Seventh Crown into a larger roleplaying setting capable of launching more products through future Kickstarters and eventually on their own merit. We need your help, support and some good old fashioned word-of-mouth advertising for that to happen!\nAdd-Ons\nThe following are all Add-on products that Seventh Crown backers may purchase using the Campaign Manager Backer Kit.\nSeventh Crown Tee Shirt ($15 and $5 shipping) \u2013 A simple, high quality black tee shirt with the Seventh Crown logo printed upon it.

In a randomly generated world, players assume the role of Microbes and attempt to achieve victory either by proliferation (first to 5 Units) or by eradication (first to eliminate an opposing species).  To do so, every turn  players will make strategic decisions including:\nHunting & Gathering (moving, eating, and/or attacking),\nEvolving (selecting abilities),\nMutating (increasing attributes), and\nSubdividing (cloning for additional lives, options, and as a path to victory). \nMost of the abilities and concepts were derived straight from a microbiology text book, so the game is educational and intuitive, as well as entertaining.\nPLAY\n\nExtra Miniatures:\n1x Miniature*: Add $6.00 each. (Choice - Message Me)\n4x (or more) Miniatures*: Add $5.50 each. (Choice - Message Me)\n*Includes U.S. Shipping if you also pledge for at least one Collectors Edition or Standard Edition copy of Microvores, and you want them shipped together.  Otherwise, if you just want Extra Miniatures, or want them to ship separately (Estimated Delivery is June 2015), please add an additional $6 for U.S. shipping and handling of the Miniatures. \nNote: The Miniatures are too big to use with the Micro-Edition Game Board, but they will work with the Print and Play versions.\n10 Inch Tall Collectible Virus Model Kit:\nAdd $65.00 each.(Includes US Shipping - Ships Separately from other rewards). Estimated Delivery is Feb. 2015. \nThis is for an unpainted and unassembled Virus Model Kit (with Instructions) cast with Smooth Cast 300.\nSculptor's Recommendations: Soapy wash to remove casting release spray, dry, assemble with super glue (or epoxy), let dry, grey prime, let dry, and then paint with enamel or acrylic paints.\n www.facebook.com/WendigoPublishing (\"LIKE\" it STRETCH GOAL)\nhttp://www.microvores.com/Microvores.html\nA PDF of the Rules can be downloaded at the link above. \nWhy only a $3,500 Goal?\nWhy Limited Quantities?\nWhy quick Estimated Delivery Times?\nUnlike many games on Kickstarter, we will actually be \"self-manufacturing\" copies of Microvores in the United States rather than overseas.\nWe will be using the patented system, Insert Imagination (TM), in order to do our self-manufacturing.Insert Imagination allows us to essentially \"print on demand,\" so there is no huge minimum order required (1,500 to 2,500 copies), which is usually the reason other games on Kickstarter have much higher funding goals (usually in the $15,000 to $40,000 range).As such, we are able to set our funding goal at only $3,500 which will allow us to take advantage of economics of scale in acquiring our materials.\nRemember, as you start acquiring your Insert Imagination (TM) components, they will be re-usable towards other Insert Imagination compatible games.  Ideally, you will be able to purchase print and play versions of such games, print the media, and then insert such media into your Insert Imagination components to quickly and easily assemble a physical copy of the game. \nPlease check out www.InsertImagination.net for more information and additional components available for purchase.\nTraditional overseas manufacturing usually takes at least 90 days to turn around a production order before the product is even ready to begin distribution to backers.However, since we are self-manufacturing domestically in the United States, we will be able to deliver our games much sooner.\nThat said, our games will be produced in smaller batches and distributed as they are completed.To be conservative and not to over-extended our production capabilities, we have limited the quantity for each production batch to 50 copies per edition for a particular Estimated Delivery Time.As reward level quantities are exhausted, we will simply add another identical reward level, and merely adjust the Estimated Delivery Time.For example, once the Standard Edition 50 Quantity is exhausted for Estimated Delivery of January 2015, we would add another Standard Edition 50 Quantity Reward Level with an Estimated Delivery of February 2015, and so on.Of course we don't want to overpromise, but we will make every effort to deliver our first batch of Standard Edition in December 2014.\nEssentially, the earlier you order, the sooner you will receive your copy of Microvores.\nOne exception though is for our Collectors Edition of Microvores.Since it contains miniatures produced by a third party, we have to allow for their production time.\nAS Seen on Fox35 Orlando's News:\nhttp://www.myfoxorlando.com/clip/10899500/microvores-a-game-of-parasites\nAs seen on the Dice Tower 2014 Convention Coverage:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZApNogJWcBA\nAs seen on The Meeple Mechanic's Foxhole Fiver by Daniel Zayas:\nhttp://meeplemechanic.com/foxhole-fiver/brian-fiore/\nAs seen on The Vacuous Grimoire blog by Brian Berg:\nhttp://www.vacuous-grimoire.com/2014/11/why-kickstarter-is-so-important-and.html\nAs seen on the Table for Two Show:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDGk2RO3Yqs\nAs seen on the King One Eye Blog:\nhttp://king1eye.blogspot.com/2014/07/dice-tower-game-on.html", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our second Kickstarter which means we have already successfully navigated the Kickstarter process and met our funding goal once before.

As such, this project is more involved and has different risks and challenges than our first. The most probable risk involves delays in distribution of the reward levels due to suppliers delivering their products in an untimely fashion. Additionally, there is the ever present risk of market price fluctuation between now and fulfillment. Much of the market risk, however, will be mitigated by our limiting reward level quantities to 50 at a time. Close monitoring of market prices will allow us to make adjustments as necessary to avoid disruption in reward fulfillment. \n\nMoreover, there are also the normal boiler plate risks which include, but are not limited to: Acts of God, Natural Disasters, Acts of Terrorism, War, Political Revolution, and injury or death of key persons (Me - Yikes) associated with this project.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #13", "update_userinfo": "(New Game Launch) Christmas Tree: The Decorating", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #12", "update_userinfo": "Collector Editions Have Shipped!", "update_content": "The minis have arrived!We are putting together the Collector Edition copies now!I will be sending out the last backer survey to get your latest address too, so stay tuned!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #11", "update_userinfo": "Production of Collector Editions is Underway!", "update_content": "Hello Everyone.I have been busy producing and shipping out the Micro-Edition Copies of Microvores.If you backed for Micro-Edition copies of Microvores, please check your email for USPS tracking numbers (and your mail boxes this week).Also check out our production album on our FB page:https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1587687564778006.1073741832.1428792127334218&type=1\nNow, we are working on producing the Collector Editions, and of course waiting on the Miniatures.Will keep you updated.Thanks!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #10", "update_userinfo": "Micro Editions: Produced and Shipping Out.", "update_content": " https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1570405219839574.1073741831.1428792127334218&type=1\nSee the process; click the link above.

We get two new materials, Umbristine and Waterwood, with the former being a shadow-related metal mined via both alchemy and conventional techniques by the Umbral and the latter being wood that is infused with the power of elemental water. \nOn the conventional side of weapons, a new monk weapon is introduced that actually doubles as a music instrument, while alchemists get their own pouch and everyone who loves throwing daggers gets a cool harness that works as a substitute for the quick draw-feat for the 6 throwing daggers it can hold. Nice idea.\n After that, we get a plethora of alchemical mixtures for the new combat alchemist class \u2013 dusts, grenades, oils, potions, salves and vapors. At least one of a kind for each level is provided.\n Clerics also get some love in the form of 7 new domains: Endurance, Ice, Pain, Pestilence, Shadowborn, Spirit and Undead.

For more than a decade the small village of Kuras has survived on the borders of the Trackless Jungle. They grew their crops and tended their livestock in peace, trusting that their annual sacrifice to the jungle deity, Pelazin, would protect them from the dangers that inhabit the wilds so near to their homes. But something has changed. Citizens are dying, murdered in the darkness. Is it the wrath of a jungle god, unsatisfied with their recent sacrifice or a sadistic murderer praying on the residents of this small village? Perhaps the source is something else entirely. The characters must delve into the depths of this mystery and determine the truth before more innocent blood is shed upon the farmlands of Kuras.  See a review here!\nLycan's Bane (Print & PDF)\nAn adventure designed for four to six characters of 5th-7th level.  The tensions between the Illurian Empire and the nature worshipping nation of Valin are high, and growing with every cycle of the moons. The lycanthropes of Valin grow stronger as the red moon Alhara begins to rise and an attack is eminent, Illurian commanders are certain of it. Now, the mages of the Empire have created a weapon to rob the Valinites of the their strength. This weapon, the Lycan's Bane, must be couriered to the border, but Valinite spies are everywhere. Its power prevents it from being transported by the arts of magic, and all military action is being watched. This responsibility now falls on the player characters, to do with as they will.\nCustom Adventure\nA special few backers will garner the right for Silver Crescent Publishing to craft a custom adventure for YOUR OWN gaming group!

SCP team as only the Twilight Dragon deserves for your generous contribution\nRibbon Dancer and Shadow Weaver Archetypes ($13,000) Locked The performer twirled and leapt, her lithe form intertwining with two flaming streamers in a sensual dance of unity. Blazing ribbons teasingly caressed her bronzed flesh, drawing gasps of amazement from the audience before her. The flames embraced her frame, yet did not burn, for the element came from within. Toned muscles in calves and thighs rippled and tightened as she moved to the intricate steps of her own design. A complete blending of element and woman, fire and flesh in perfect harmony with one another.\nImagine this being you, conquering the elements of fire or ice, earth or wind, taming them in an artistic and beautiful dance of the elements, understanding them so completely that they can also be deadly and dangerous to your foes. This is the Elemental Ribbon Dancer\u2026  \nThe Elemental Dancer is a series of four archetypes for the bard core class that focus on performances centering around intricate dance skills as well as the art of infusing those routines with the power of the elements, creating a beautiful and dangerous fighting style. Each archetype will focus on one particular element, and the abilities and spells will be drawn from its nature.\nNow clear your mind, wiping away all but the black field of your mind\u2019s vision and the scarce hint of light illuminating just enough for your imagination to play tricks with your sight and senses. From that darkness, wisps of iridescent shadow begin to slowly glide in your direction and you can feel the arcane power rising as the dusky tendrils come together and coalesce into a dim figure. It is a man, a mage cloaked in the shadows of his art. They are his weapons, and his armor. He calls upon the night and creatures from the plane between mortal realms answer to his whim. Suddenly, with a grim smile, he pulls the very fabric of shadows around himself and is gone once more leaving you cold, shaken, and battling with your own dark imaginings\u2026  \nThe Shadow Weaver is an archetype for the Wizard core class that focuses on the use and manipulation of darkness and shadows as both tools and weapons. It includes many of the shadow-related illusion spells in the Pathfinder Core Rulebook, but is far from limited to such incantations. Among other things the weaver can reach into the Plane of Shadow, and pull upon its very essence to fuel his spells and call forth aid.\nHero Lab Data File Locked\nAnyone contributing at the Respected Peasant level or higher will receive a Hero Lab data file for the campaign setting, including all of the character options, monsters, deities and spells from the book.\nShadow Magic Locked\nIt began with the Shadow Weaver, and now the shadow's reach will continue to encompass ever more with a new chapter dedicated to Shadow Magic! New shadow spells will be added to the Campaign Setting, as well as character options, to include optional character abilities, feats and more!\nTournament of Souls PDF Locked\nThe annual Tournament of Souls is a contest in which creators from across the Illurian Empire craft undead creatures and constucts in order to pit them against one another in single combat, until only one remains.  This year's competition was fierce!  For this stretch goal we will assemble a PDF of the terrain maps in which the combatants fought, statistics for the creatures (and perhaps some of the Creators as well) and the transcripts of each incredible battle!  We may even throw in a few additional surprises just for fun!\nPrint edition of Winter's Queen Locked  \nFor those of you who have achieved the rank of Illurian City Mage or higher, you are already able to experience the prequel adventure and exclusive forum access; reaching this stretch goal allows us to expand that experience significantly. Those who would normally receive only a PDF copy of the prequel to our upcoming adventure path will instead receive a full-color print of the adventure. Additionally, the PDF will be provided to anyone that has joined the church of Steelight (as a Cleric of Steelight) or attained a higher rank in Illurian Society. All of those in this group will now receive exclusive access to a section of our forums specifically set up to allow us to hear about your groups\u2019 trials and experiences as you fight through this adventure, and use that information to shape the adventure path itself as we look forward.\nWarm Fuzzy!: A feeling of warmth and good cheer for supporting fellow gamers in pursuit of something incredible.\nInclusion on the Backer List: There will be various sections on our list of gracious backers.

(go ahead, BE the Twilight Dragon, your ego is calling!)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery publishing project risks delays as deadlines approach. Writers are scrambling to ensure they have all of their tasks completed even as the editors are being overwhelmed by what they've accomplished already. Artists paint amazing tapestries of color\u2026 that can sometimes turn out to be not at all what they were intended to be, while the layout guy is begging everyone to get everything in order so they can begin the final design of the book. We have already tried to address as many of these potential issues as possible, even before the Kickstarter began, by starting early. This isn't just a concept, or a rough idea, the ground work is already there, established by coordination and team work, and the rest is in process as we type. Here is what we have accomplished so far:\n\nOur artists began the daunting task of re-imagining the world and showing it to the rest of us more than 8 months ago. This should give them a good head start on deadlines, and compensate for snags that may occur when we get closer to final production.\n\nNow we turn to the literary aspects, including game mechanics and player options as well as flavor, legends and locations. Some of the writer\u2019s new content has already been completed and is in the hands of our editor. Though there is more yet to be done, this too should give us some breathing room if the writing falls behind schedule.\n\nFinally we address the polishing steps, namely editing and layout. As we mentioned previously, much of the editing work is already underway and the author and editor are working closely to hammer out language inconsistencies and the flow of the text. Our layout specialist is very nearly done creating templates that will make pulling all of the additional content together, and blending it with the newly edited revision of what previously existed, a much faster process.\n\nWe have tried to examine each aspect of production, and set each specialist on the path to completion well before the Kickstarter began. By doing this, we hope to ensure that we meet our deadlines despite any unforeseen complications we may encounter, and get the Realms completed and in the hands of our backers in a timely manner.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Silver Crescent Publishing\n2 created \u00b7 56 backed"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #10", "update_userinfo": "With stalwart perseverance...

The Cross of Fire Saga adventure path is the first adventure path for Obsidian Apocalypse, which was released in 2013, as the premiere setting for the post-apocalyptic survival horror genre for Pathfinder. The reason that we are having this Kickstarter project is to generate the funds we need to pay for the cost of development, writing, artwork and printing this adventure path and getting it out to the premiere retail gaming stores.\nThe Cross of Fire Saga Adventure Path Contributors:\nSteven T.

He\u2019s produced material for backers of the Obsidian Apocalypse setting\nWhat is the next threshold goals with this kickstarter:\nThe Cross of Fire Saga adventure path consists of the following adventures:\nPart 0: Long Way Home - Estimated Page Count: 8 Pages\nHURLED INTO ENDLESS NIGHT\nSeeking potent magic in the hands of an insane entity, accomplished adventurers find themselves transported to the bleak wasteland of Abaddon. As they explore their new surroundings, they must encounter a host of new terrors and determine whether to save a desperate caravan of nomads. Can adventurers save them, and can their weary new allies help them find a reliable way home?\nThe Long Way Home is an adventure for use with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. The story and encounters are the first episode of the Cross of Fire Saga, but can also be played as a stand\u00adalone adventure with light modification. The module includes a brief history of the Cross of Fire, an introduction to the world of Abaddon, and a powerful new curse. Characters should take up the adventure approximately half\u00adway through 8th level. If they survive their first nights on Abaddon, they should reach 9th level by the adventure\u2019s conclusion.\nWho is Cassandra Papacis? More importantly....can she be trusted?\nPart 1: Havoc of the Mind\u2019s Eye  - Estimated Page Count: 32 Pages\nBLOOD AND TERROR AWAIT\nNothing is as it seems in the blasted countryside surrounding the insular fortress\u00adtown of Lockgate. For weeks, the people there \u00ad\u00adlocals and outsiders alike\u00ad \u00adhave been terrorized by a creature they only know as the Beast. It strikes fast and vanishes, leaving behind mutilated corpses to find. The town\u2019s lord has issued a reward for the death of the beast and a band of monster hunters have answered. The seer traveling with the PCs leads them straight into the heart of this mystery where it becomes quickly evident there is more at work than a simple ravaging monster. Can the PCs unearth the true source of Lockgate\u2019s horror?\n\nHavoc of the Mind\u2019s Eye is an investigative horror adventure for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. The scenario is designed for four 9th level PCs, and is suitable as a single horror tale or as the second episode of the Cross of Fire Saga. By the end of the adventure, the PCs will either die screaming or reach 10th level.\n\nPart 2: Ravagers of the Shadow Black - Estimated Page Count: 32 Pages \nFALL TO SHADOWS\nTwo lost Osirian civilizations fell deep within the earth during the Cataclysm. They struggle to survive at the expense of fey calling the subterranean tunnels home. When a strange plague of poisoned light corrupts the land, the desperate people starve and turn upon one another. Can a small group of heroes return the peace and cleanse the blight, or are they doomed to die in the lands of endless shadow?\nRavagers of the Shadowfall is an adventure for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. It can be played as a unique scenario for 10th level characters, or as the third episode of the Cross of Fire Saga. The adventure includes 32 action\u00adpacked pages filled with dark artifacts, gremlins, survivalist adventuring, and a challenging new underground setting! Players can expect to reach 12th level or a shallow grave by the time they complete this adventure. \nWill the PCs be pawns in Baltazar's deadly game?\nPart 3: Raiders of the Cataclysm - Estimated Page Count: 32 Pages \nAS BELOW, SO ABOVE  \n\nHigh atop the Amaranth Glacier lie the ruins of long\u00ad abandoned Qhazlor . A band of sorely tested travelers seeks a unique path home, away from the strange mountains and salted valleys of Abaddon. Equipped with half of the ancient tools they need to escape this hell on earth, they encounter another party much like themselves. The adventurers must survive on the harsh plateau long enough to overcome a wrecked band of crosstraders who also seek a way home, or convince them to share the power that they themselves are only beginning to understand.\n\nRaiders of the Cataclysm is a scenario for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, and the penultimate adventure in the Cross of Fire Saga. It includes several dangerous encounters, a description of the mutinous crew of the Endurance, and a pair of climactic battles that will test the PCs\u2019 outer limits. Those who survive are likely to reach 14th level.\n\nIs this kaylethon mercenary friend? or foe?\nPart 4: Crusaders of the Cross of Fire - Estimated Page Count: 32 Pages\nLEAVE ALL HOPE OUTSIDE\n\nArmed with four mighty relics, a beleaguered band of adventurers arrives at the doors to a place known only as the Crucible\u2014an abandoned adamantine mine once worked by disciplined, benevolent monks. None doubt that terror and death wait within, but the path home requires the PCs to take up sword and spell once more and face the dark truth concealed within an ancient monastery. Who can withstand the shocking truth, or the vessels of evil that lay it bare?\n\nCrusaders of the Cross of Fire concludes the disturbing story of the Cross of Fire Saga. Within its pages are more than a dozen traps, haunts, and monstrous encounters devised with the express intent of keeping the PCs\u2019 corpses trapped within the Crucible forever. Though the depraved powers will more than likely claim their souls, characters who survive should reach 15th level before the final encounters.\n\nThis man saved the world from a tyrant once. Will you pay the price he requires to return home?\nThe Cross of Fire itself!\nBackground: Since 2000, the d20 System gaming license and the Open Game License (OGL) have allowed publishers to share a common framework for creating roleplaying games using the System Reference Document (SRD), which contains the same core mechanics as those found in Wizards of the Coast's Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition. Under the OGL, third-party publishers use the SRD as the basis of many different games. Paizo Publishing expanded the concept of the OGL with their creation and development of the Pathfinder Resource Document (PRD), and in turn made a successful open gaming system.\nPatronage and Funding: Our project initially funds at the $8,000 level. We intend to achieve this goal in a little over 40 days\u2014from 25 September to 4 November. This amount covers the costs to write and produce the product for the backers, and gives us a head start on backing the retail level. Of course, the project is impossible without our backers, so backer levels allow an impressive amount of retail product for much less than the expected retail cost for the adventures and their support product.\n\nProcesses: Louis Porter Jr has produced fantasy roleplaying games and support for those games for 15 years. Our commitment to our backers, in addition to high quality and impressive value, is to have the materials we publish to you finished and shipped on time. We are grateful for our backers and will continue our commitment to timely delivery of a unique professional product.\n\nThe Pathfinder community has loyal fans and creative designers. Backers at certain levels earn the right to also submit professional designs for publication in an advanced stretch goal. Becoming a patron on this project is a great way to gain a design credit on the book, which in turn is a great way to gain experience and build a resume for those interested in pursuing a career in game publishing!\n\nWhat are you backing?The funds form the kickstarter campaign allow us to produce high-quality professional products, including materials to provide to retail vendors. At the successful funding level of $8,000, each backer receives the product their backer level implies, but the funds only pay for the printing of the first adventure. Beyond that point, the addition of several exciting stretch goals allow us to finance the retail expense for the remaining products.\n\nWhere is the money going?\n Back it for a Buck (B4$) Challenge\nAre you a fan of LPJ Design and want to see this kickstarter succeed?

And I need to deal my dice. \nI make dice. Dice of awesome.  \nDice are the gateway for reality and our imagination. So isn't it high time that you own a set that inspires you? A set that you love to marvel at? A set that your friends would say, \"Holy sh&tballs, those dice are epic!\" The Wizard's Gambit dice set is just that set.  \nThe Wizard's Gambit is my interpretation and embodiment of the Wizard's tutelage and intelligence. It is the representation of a wizards spell working on dice for greater luck. A wizard's Arcana Fortuna if you will. And who knows, perhaps these dice are really magically enhanced to help you slay your foes, swindle the unsuspecting and perform feats of awesomeness.  \nMy goal is simple, to bring dice into the world that bridges the gap between your gameplay and the stories unfolding in your mind. That and to make your friends wickedly jealous of your sweet shwag. Just saying.\n The Dice \nCreating dice is a lot of fun. I start by drafting designs on my Nexus 7. Surprisingly the drafting process can be somewhat difficult. You have to create a design that can scale down to less than 15 mm while still looking good and having the numbers easily legible. Not an easy feat especially when you are trying to create ridonkulous designs.\nFrom there I import the designs into Photoshop (or Illustrator if I have a lot of touch ups) and size the designs to fit a die facet. The real fun begins here. Once the design is sized and set I take a blank die and place it in a laser engraver. Then I hit print in PS and watch the magic begin. In case you don't know, a laser engraver shoots a high wattage laser beam and burns images directly onto an object. It's literally like printing with ink except this printer can kill you. #Ilovetechnology. \nOnce the die is created it's back to the drawing board, er, drawing tablet. I examine what's flawed in the design and make tweaks. Then I burn several new sets and the dice and the final prototype is made.\nADD-ONS\n1) 6xD6 Add-on.

Double posting is the standard in the pin game and we always offer this with our pieces.

I'm floored. \nThank you so much for all your support. With your help, we've shown that fantasy rpgs can thrive outside the realm of European legends, in lands both wondrous and filled with high adventure.\nBacker Reward Levels: This project has grown quite large for an RPG project, and some stretch goals expanded well beyond the original plan, especially the Ten Arabian Nights (which was previously 7, 8, or 9 Nights!). Because Kickstarter doesn't allow us to edit the rewards listed on the right hand side, we recommend scrolling down to the pledge table instead, which lists rewards for each level.\nIf you missed the Kickstarter, it's not too late--you can still get the books! Use the preorder links below to reserve your copy.\nSouthlands Hardcover in Full Color\nSouthlands Bestiary in Full Color \nSouthlands 7-Dice Set\nNothing says adventure quite like lost cities, tombs buried deep beneath the desert sands, and pirate ships sailing along a serpent-infested jungle coast. And nothing makes fantasy heroics quite as great as the graves of lost gods, mighty viziers commanding the charge of camel-riding cavalry, or enormous elemental lords trampling entire cities into ruin.\nKobold Press is bringing high adventure back to the tabletop, with a full-color book of ancient hieroglyphic magic, powerful genie lords, and monsters that would give Sindbad nightmares\u2014all compatible with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game (and a great sourcebook for any fantasy RPG).\nWith your support, we've already added more than 40 extras from art to bonus PDFs to big expansions to the core book. Explore the ruins and reap the rewards in the Southlands!\nThe Southlands takes you to the great empires and wealthy kingdoms of the hotter climates, drawing on fantasy traditions from the Arabian Nights to Egyptian mythology. Imagine the Scorpion King, Conan, and Sindbad joining forces to find a lost treasure, and fighting genies and were-hyenas along the way\u2014not to mention six-armed demon lords!\nPlayers will find many new character options for Pathfinder RPG. GMs will find kingdoms, treasures, monsters and adventure hooks for desert, jungle, and tropical mountain adventures. There\u2019s also vast reams of esoteric lore for those who seek the knowledge found only within the most ancient papyrus scrolls.\nSouthlands Core Book: People, Places, & Monsters\nLost cities, deadly ruins, and a wealth of new character options\u2014from werelions to insect folk to jinnborn heroes, as well as black lotus magic, incantations, and demonic cults. \nThe Southlands offers tools for better games, such as the flavor and character of the City of Cats, as well as a heavily playtested Bestiary stuffed with creatures written by Paizo staff, professional freelancers, and project backers. Join the tradition of Conan, Aladdin, and Sindbad, and bring a touch of wild adventure into your game!\nThe Southlands core book uses the Midgard Campaign Setting; but its cities, lore, peculiar creatures, and characters are easily portable to any campaign with Southlands themes and climate.\nDesign and Publish \nThe current draft of the Southlands book includes 20 new fantasy monsters, suitable for populating wide deserts, mountain shrines, and lost temples. These monsters include giant abominations, tropical lycanthropes, and even subtly malevolent undead. It will offer everything from highly magical creatures to natural horrors, and far beyond, because of the wide net we're casting for monster designers.\nBackers at the Beast Master level and above can submit their own monsters. Creatures that make the cut will be included in the Bestiary section of the book, with full-color illustrations that bring all their wonder and menace to snarling life.\nNew Player Character Options\nSouthlands also includes new races like the tosculi insectfolk, expanded material for aasimar and detailed gnoll PCs, plus additional options for humans, dwarves, and others. It expands the options for fighters, clerics, wizards, and many others with a dozen archetypes, including the sword dancer fighter archetype, the face of Bastet for clerics, an aeromancer wizard, and deep explorer rogues. \nOriginal racial archetypes for dwarves and gnolls are also included, as is new gear, new magical items, and new spells and magic, such as the 2 new domains for Bastet, the goddess of cats.\nSouthlands Bestiary (UNLOCKED!)\nThe project has unlocked a separate Southlands Bestiary volume, so we will be publishing many monsters designed by backers. After seeing the range and quality of the backer spells for Deep Magic, we\u2019re confident that some amazing monsters will find their way into the book.\nMonster books are always art-intensive and require careful development, so we know this is going to be a big addition to the project. Thank you to everyone who gave us the chance to add this treat to the project!\nBackers, for more details on submitting your monster for design review, check the FAQ. We'll also be posting about the design submissions process in a locked post for backers.\nEXCLUSIVE: Ten Arabian Nights\nKobold Press published a volume of six adventures set in and around the free city of Siwal in 2008 for 3rd Edition D&D under the OGL. These adventures have been revised, expanded, and updated to Pathfinder RPG rules by Paizo freelance designer and developer Jim Groves, who is also adding a new adventure to the book--and we've added three more all-new adventures thanks to your support.\nIt includes:\nDivided Hearts, by Jim Groves: Nothing is as it seems when the PCs are hired to recover the Sultan's talking monkey. The divs make their debut in Midgard in a plot to destroy true love and the Free City itself!\nThe Gravebinder\u2019s Daughter, by Wolfgang Baur:A local gravebinder's daughter has gone missing in Siwal's necropolis, a graveyard precinct that neither sleeps or rests quietly.\nThe Sand Pirates, by Clay Fleischer: The Sultan requests the heroes wrest a legendary and magical sandship from a crew of nefarious pirates who contest his dominion over the desert sands.\nOasis of the Blood Moon, by Jeff Grubb: The heroes are drawn by chance into a kidnapping by undead fiends with the power to masquerade as the living.\nCult of the Howling God, by Wolfgang Baur: A assassin-acolyte of a profane cult strikes at the righteous and the pious for revenge, and to unleash an unimaginable horror upon the citizens of the Free City.\nWishbound, by Joshua Stevens: The laws which govern djinn nobility are strict and unforgiving, and the best of intentions lead to damnation. The PCs are hired for a mission of reconciliation\u2014and if they're lucky, redemption.\nBottled Desire, by David \u201cZeb\u201d Cook:When the 3rd son of wealthy merchant falls in love with a janni, the bride-to-be elects to assume the identity of a fictional ship's captain from far away. The PCs discover the hard way, the only thing worse than evil spirits and hyena men are your future in-laws.\nTomb of the Elephant God, by Mike Shel (FUNDED Stretch Goal): Long ago, the tomb of the Elephant God was built, and the god's son interred there--and all who know its location died. Now, though, the tomb is rediscovered. What remains within?\nTomb-Palace of Nakresh the Many-Handed, by Amber Scott (FUNDED Stretch Goal): The patron god of thieves and wizards has a sacred tomb-palace, and many wonder what plundered treasures lie within. Surely no one is foolish enough to steal from the demon-lord of thieves?\nAgainst the Serpent King, by Mike Welham (FUNDED Stretch Goal): The characters must stop an insidious plot to convert an entire city's populace to serpentine slaves, just the first step in the master villain's plot for world domination!\nThis adventure collection is exclusive to the Southlands Kickstarter, and it is not available anywhere else. \nSpecial Editions\nThe leatherette and leatherbound editions of Southlands are available at some reward tiers. Each of these versions has a heavier, higher-quality cover, foil stamping, bookmarks, endpapers, and improved bindery and care. These premium editions are only available through Kobold Press and this Kickstarter (some retailer tiers also gain access to these editions).\nThe special editions will be limited in quantity.\nCoins of the Southlands\nBladesmith Todd Gdula will be minting some ancient-looking coins for Southlands. The process is labor-intensive, but it\u2019s worth it for coins that are not machine-made. These bronze coins look and feel ancient, and we\u2019re very happy to offer a touch of another world with these coins. \nThese coins make perfect props, like the ones common in the markets of Siwal and the distant oases and jungles, and in the fists of caravan masters. More details to come on these.\nThrough the Red Portal\nThis Grimoire of Nuria Natal is a lorebook that addresses the history and lost magic of the first wizards and god-kings, describe some of their peculiar talents, and offers a glimpse behind the masks of the gods of Midgard. It makes great reading for anyone looking for an undead necromancer-king, a mummy struck by divine madness, or the curse of the eldest theurge.\nThe text and illustrations are done in an archaic style, and Through the Red Portal will be printed as a letterpress book, from cast metal type on a hand press. Also in the old style, there will be no PDF version of this book.\nStretch Goals\nGiven the chance to expand the project, of course, we\u2019ll do so. Some of the stretch goals are hidden but we have unlocked more than a dozen stretch goals since hitting our primary funding goal (an up-to-date list is present in the FAQ). These include additional books, more art, new PC races, extra adventures, demonic cults, and other rewards for adventuring under a pitiless sun!\nAnd just a hint of what is to come...\nSupporter Goals: We reached ALL of our supporter goals, which were unlocked by the number of backers, not the number of dollars pledged. Thank you for your continued support!\nWe\u2019ll ship your Southlands core book together with the Ten Arabian Nights adventure collection and Southlands Bestiary. The special Through the Red Portal booklet will most likely ship separately, as will the Southlands dice and coins.\nFor international backers, we\u2019re working with a European partner. This means that the costs are somewhat better than shipping from the US directly, so we have lowered the overall cost to you. \nCanadian backers, your shipping works out slightly higher than listed (at the expected weight). However, we're absorbing that cost rather than adding more expensive Canadian-only reward tiers.\nThe various stretch goals include some that unlock certain add-ons that will appeal to some but not all backers. These include extra books, maps, Hero Lab data files, and other items. \nPlease note that some add-ons will be delivered separately (in some cases, months earlier). These have separate shipping costs.\nSouthlands Core Book $30: Add a second copy of the core book shipped in the US for just $30 (you save by combining shipping). For international backers, an extra book is $40, including combined shipping with existing print rewards. Note that this add-on is $39 if you are a US backer with all-digital rewards, or $49 if you are an international backer with all-digital rewards. Ships July 2015.\nSouthlands Hero Lab Data Files $9: Add the Hero Lab files for all the archetypes, monsters, feats, spells, and more from the Southlands to your pledge. \nSouthlands Bronze Coin $19: A hand-forged, hefty bronze coin from the Southlands, added to your pledge. Includes shipping.\nSouthlands Bestiary PDF $12: Add the Bestiary PDF to your rewards.\nSouthland Bestiary Print $29: Add the full-color, printed Bestiary to your rewards. Includes shipping to the US for print backers. International shipping is a bit complex, but it will be available for combined shipping with other print books.\nSouthlands Bestiary Print+PDF $39: Add both the print and PDF Southlands Bestiary to your rewards, and get a break on the price of getting them separately. Includes US shipping for print backers; international shipping still in flux, but this title will be available for combined shipping with other print books.\nSouthlands 7-Dice Set: Add-on available for $14 for the US (includes shipping), and $28 internationally (includes international shipping--we're working on a solution to bring that down for European backers).\nDeep Magic Book+PDF $55: Our most recent Kickstarter book. For international backers, Deep Magic is $76 (including separate shipping). Ships November 2014.\nDeep Magic Special Runebound Edition + PDF $130: Leatherette cover with foil stamp. Only 6 copies available (our reserve against missing/late backers from Deep Magic). Separate shipping is included for 2014 delivery. First come, first served.\nMidgard Hardcover, Autographed, +PDF $50: Get a signed copy of the Midgard Campaign Setting. For international backers, Midgard Campaign Setting add-on comes to $69. Ships in November 2014.\nNew Paths Compendium, Exclusive Color Edition, and PDF, $40: New classes, feats, and magic for the Theurge, Shaman, Spell-Less Ranger, White Necromancer, Savant, Battle Scion, and more. This exclusive color edition is available only directly from Kobold Press. For international backers, this add-on comes to $54 with shipping. Ships in November 2014.\nKobold Press Patch, $6: Get the newest version of our iron-on, embroidered patch, featuring the Kobold mascot and \"Small but Fierce\" motto. Ships in November 2014.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nKobold Press has crowdfunded and shipped over 30 tabletop game titles since 2006, and it has won Gold and Silver ENnie Awards for this work. The creative team is experienced, so the primary risk on this project is that one or more of the key creative partners will fall ill or suffer some injury that prevents their completing their portion of the work in a timely way.\n\nFortunately, much of the Southlands setting, race, class, and adventure design, development, and editing work is already done; we worked hard in spring and summer. Right now, the majority of the book is in editing and some is ready to be laid out. Likewise, we already have cover, maps, and interior art commissioned because of our confidence in this book.\n\nThe other challenge will be in gathering, choosing, developing, and editing monster text from backers, and in doing the same for new design work from stretch goals. Backers who pledge at those levels must deliver text promptly and it will be developed and edited fairly quickly. While theoretically one backer could hold up the project, in practice if a backer fails to deliver a monster for inclusion in a timely way, we'll move ahead on deadline rather than hold up the entire project.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #54", "update_userinfo": "Southlands Archetypes and Magic in New Paths Compendium", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #53", "update_userinfo": "Yggdrasil Fanzine and Midgard Revised", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #52", "update_userinfo": "Expanded Demon Cults Ends Monday", "update_content": "It's true!

These will be emailed to those 308 backers within one week of the campaign's successful closing.\nROGUES. ASSASSINS. MERCENARIES. \nCoin is their master, and their trade, more often than not, is blood. Something about these nefarious types appeals to the fantasy reader. Perhaps it is that they have abandoned the moral set that dictates what is socially acceptable in our world. In these tales, we live vicariously, intrepidly, and by our blades or our wits or a culmination of both to some degree. These are BLACKGUARDS.\nWhat we at RAGNAROK PUBLICATIONS want to do is offer a premium collection of 20+ short stories by popular writers set in the worlds of their own making. The authors we've enlisted are all known for writing some roguish types in their respective series, and here we will be illuminating them just a bit more by dusky moonlight. We have Michael J. Sullivan's RIYRIA, Carol Berg's DUST AND LIGHT, David Dalglish's world of DEZREL where his SHADOWDANCE series is set, Mark Lawrence's BROKEN EMPIRE, and many more.\nThe great news is that I already have the first drafts of these stories in hand! And, even better, Ragnarok has already fronted some of the coin to pay for the cover art, so what we're seeking is the backing to pay the authors the professional rate they deserve\u2014that being the SFWA-suggested 7 cents per word\u2014and cover all the various costs of production and printing. We've produced a similar project before when we successfully funded and fulfilled the KAIJU RISING: AGE OF MONSTERS anthology, and the authors listed below have put their faith in us. We truly hope you will do the same!\nThe cover seen above is the actual cover, illustrated by concept artist ARMAN AKOPIAN, whose work you've likely seen on Square Enix and Eidos Montreal's THIEF Video Game.\nOn the inside, you will find a tour de force of authors known for penning tales of rogues in every lash scars and scab-red color:\nCAROL BERG, \"Seeds\"  \nRICHARD LEE BYERS, \"Troll Trouble\" \nDAVID DALGLISH, \"Take You Home\" \nJAMES ENGE, \"Thieves at the Gate\" \nJOHN GWYNNE, \"Better to Live than to Die\" \nLIAN HEARN, \"His Kikuta Hands\" \nSNORRI KRISTJANSSON, \"A Kingdom and a Horse\" \nJOSEPH LALLO, \"Seeking the Shadow\" \nMARK LAWRENCE, \"The Secret\" \nTIM MARQUITZ, \"A Taste of Agony\" \nPETER ORULLIAN, \"A Length of Cherrywood\" \nCAT RAMBO, \"The Subtler Art\" \nLAURA RESNICK, \"Friendship\" \nMARK SMYLIE, \"Manhunt\" \nKENNY SOWARD, \"Jancy's Justice\" \nSHAWN SPEAKMAN, \"The White Rose Thief\" \nJON SPRUNK, \"Sun and Steel\" \nANTON STROUT, \"Scream\" \nMICHAEL J.

Enjoy the streamlined, easy-to-learn rules. Create epic heroes limited only by your imagination.\nWhat is Ingenium?\nIngenium is a fantasy tabletop role-playing game. It has a culturally-rich setting, a simple set of rules, and an emphasis on telling great stories with your friends.\nArtwork by Eric Lofgren\nWhat makes it different?\nIt uses a simple \"Three Word\" mechanic to create characters, weapons, armor, and spells. That, combined with the freeform \"Talent\" progression system, lets you create the kind of hero you want to play without spending ages poring over rules.\nThe core mechanic is a simple matter of rolling a ten-sided die, adding some modifiers, and comparing to either a target number or an opposed roll.\nAll of the standard dice, excepting twenty-siders, are used in the game.\nWhat changed in the new edition?\nIngenium Second Edition is the culmination of three years of tweaking and experimenting with the Ingenium fantasy role-playing game. The \"Three Words\" character creation system that proved so popular has been expanded into equipment and spellcasting.\nWe added the Eiridia setting, which is a culturally-diverse world inspired by Robert E. Howard's Hyborea, J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth, and Mercedes Lackey's Valdemar.\nWe added new professions and races, and tweaked the rules of character creation to make them easier to understand and more fun to play.\nA Myconid, one of the new races, by Johnnie Johnson\nWe incorporated three years of player feedback. The system is more balanced, cleaner, and even more polished than before.\nAnd the book is much bigger than it was before. With all the new content, the book is pushing 160 pages - and that's without artwork. We're looking at a 200 page book with all of the artwork we hope to include, which is TWICE the size of the original edition!\nWhy Kickstart a Second Edition?\nOne of the biggest issues people had with the first edition wasn't the game itself, but rather the lack of artwork. With such a unique and interesting game world, it was sometimes difficult to envision all of the awesome new concepts.\nWe want to fix that. We want to fix that in a BIG way.\nSo we need your help. We have a number of fantastic artists already signed up to fill the book with amazing artwork. The cost of artwork, though, is huge. We need forty pages of it, and that's not cheap.\nThis Kickstarter is more important than just getting artwork for the book, though. This Kickstarter will help us actually get into retail stores, something that up until now has been impossible due to our finances. See, we're entirely self-financed - we're strongly against taking out debt to fund the company, so our year-after-year growth as a company has been purely a result of profits going back into the company. Those profits are thanks to our awesome customers, and we couldn't have done this without you.\nSo, we're asking for just a bit of assistance to push past that final hurdle and break into the big leagues.\nTake a look\nWe have a special Quick Start guide that we pared down to 90 pages that is available exclusively at DriveThru RPG. It is a rough document but it will give you a good look at what is in the book mechanically!  Rules, spells, gear, and a free adventure await inside!  Go get it and see why we would love if you'd back this project!\n\nhttp://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/129064\nOK, so what are the rewards?\nWe wanted to do something really special for this Kickstarter. Most Kickstarted RPGs are content to just give backers the book that will eventually be in stores. We're going a couple steps further. Not only will every copy be signed by the author of Ingenium, but this is a special Kickstarter-ONLY version of the game. The unique cover will set your copy apart from the regular retail version - forever.\nPossible Kickstarter-only version cover design. Not final!\nWe are producing a set of Ingenium t-shirts that are also unique to this Kickstarter, and are not the same as the general-release Ingenium shirts we'll be offering later this year.\nOur generous backers helped us produce custom-etched Silver Gryphon Games dice in an earlier Kickstarter, and as an extra bonus, we'll be including FULL SETS of them for some of the pledge levels.\nThe talented Alyssa Faden, our cartographer, is producing a gorgeous full-color world map for the Eiridia setting. Some pledge levels will receive an enormous 3 foot by 2 foot poster of the map printed on high quality paper.\nAn example of cartography by Alyssa Faden\nFor the extremely generous backers, we have a very special reward - the ability to make a permanent mark on the Eiridia world with your very own deity added to the pantheon! We'll work with you to craft him, her, or it, and get artwork done for it that we'll put on a poster just for you and no one else.\nThose who pledge at that level also get access to the Ingenium Patrons' Circle, a web forum that only a very small group of people have access to. Members of the Circle will get input into future Ingenium products and sneak peaks at content as it's being worked on.\nMini-goals\nWe have the main goal, and that's fantastic, but part of participating in a Kickstarter is not only making our dream happen, but having a hand in guiding the project yourself! In that spirit, we are adding mini-goals to the Kickstarter.\nEvery Thousand Dollars...\nStarting at $2000, every thousand dollars that the Kickstarter achieves, we will add a new material for weapon and armor construction. Those are all listed below and are being added to the rule book as we hit them!\nAchieved April 24th!\nAchieved May 7th!\nAchieved May 7th!\nAchieved May 9th!\n Every 10 Backers...\nStarting at 70, every 10 backers that support us, we will add a new Miracle or Ritual to the spell list! These are incredibly powerful spells that cannot be constructed with the Three Word system used for standard spells!\nAchieved April 25th!\nAchieved April 27th!\nAchieved May 3rd!\nAchieved May 7th!\nHow about stretch goals?\nWe have some great stretch goals in mind. We're only going to show you the first two unless we reach them both, though!\nIf we reach $15,000, we'll add the Rune Magic system to the game. This system adds an additional level of customization to the game and another 20 pages of content!\nIf we hit $25,000, we'll make the entire book full color. That's right - ALL of the artwork will be beautiful color paintings!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur biggest risk is that all of the artists who've signed on to do artwork for the book back out. We've mitigated that by cultivating a large pool of artists over the years who consistently do good work on time and on budget. \n\nIn the absolute worst case scenario, where NONE of our artists can finish the project on time, then we will need to reach out into our (extensive) network and find new artists. This will delay the project by no more than three months at the most.\n\nAnother risk is if something happens to Ben Overmyer, the author/layout artist, that prevents him from finishing the layout and post-production work. In that event, co-founder of Silver Gryphon Games Kevin Rohan can finish the project.

Please watch the video above (if you haven\u2019t already), and take a look below, which shows what 2-set backers get. It includes 54 free stretch goal pieces (27 for each set) so far! Click to see the latest Stretch Goal Map or our Offer Guide, which lists all our latest Add-on Packs.\nIf you\u2019d like to back this Kickstarter, there are two key parts: 1) Main Cavern sets, now with lots of free, included stretch goals (pledge for as many main sets as you\u2019d like); and, 2) optional Add-on Packs, which add incredible variety to your setups. You must pledge for at least 2 main sets to order add-on packs.\nOur modular game tiles are like beautiful, highly detailed, handcrafted Lego for gamers, made of a specially developed material called Dwarvenite.  Dwarvenite feels great \u2013 and it\u2019s nearly indestructible.\nThe links below provide a gallery of photos and Offer Guide, with more videos here, and lots of details below.  \n                      Please note that the water is pure Dwarvenite, not an added acrylic layer. We have found this look is better, and the product much more durable.\n  Here's our \"Death By Caverns\" 60 second video for some amazing layouts.\nTHIS NEW VIDEO BELOW SHOWS DETAILS OF OUR WATER, STALAGMITE, MUSHROOM AND ELEVATION PACKS.\nClick on the image below to use our free online Mapmaker program.  You can see how all the new set and add-on pack pieces work together to form amazing layouts.\nThe background: Last year, after 17 years devoted to our beautiful resin terrain, we decided resin just wasn\u2019t good enough! Why? While resin holds great detail, it is costly and a little bit fragile. But what to do?\nAfter nearly a year of research, we developed an incredibly durable, more affordable and high quality casting material called Dwarvenite.  We launched Dwarvenite dungeon tiles last April on Kickstarter -- and your support was staggering. \nNow, we aim for the next level \u2013 deeper detail, more intricate shapes, dramatic depth and complexity.  We\u2019re proud to present: Dwarvenite Caverns! \nJust like last year, we face the same challenge: to produce Dwarvenite Caverns, we must commit to costly steel tooling and a high production run.  So once again, we're asking for your help.  In return for your support: exclusive pricing that won't be available and incredible stretch goals that won't be included after this Kickstarter. \nWe hope you'll read on -- and join us in making Caverns an even more exciting campaign than last year!\nWhat is Dwarvenite?\nIt\u2019s a non-toxic, PVC based material, specially compounded to hold precise detail, take paint well, and withstand a serious beating. About the same density as resin, Dwarvenite has a wonderful, tactile feel. And the pieces look great. In last year\u2019s Kickstarter, Dwarven Forge President, Jeff Martin threw the original Dwarvenite Game Tiles off a 10-story tower, and then ran them over with his truck \u2013 and there was not even a scratch. While we don\u2019t suggest doing that at home, Dwarvenite will stand up to almost anything\nWhy Caverns?\nAlthough their complexity makes Cavern-shaped pieces a little more costly than last year\u2019s straight dungeons, perhaps no environment has the dramatic visual impact of a Cavern. Yet creating a great Cavern is no simple task. You need exceptional textures, vivid shapes, rich detail \u2013 and the ability to create a nearly infinite variety of subterranean scenes.\nDesign and sculpting took months to perfect. Before starting, Stefan traveled to Mammoth Caves, the world's largest cave system, to study their formations. From the shapes of the stones in our cavern floors, to the subtle curvature of the stalactite covered walls, to the striking formations throughout, our Caverns will bring your game alive. The Main Set has beautifully detailed floors, walls and \u201ccorners,\u201d along with a ton of Kickstarter-only free stretch goals.  Special add-on packs (passages, lava, water, stalagmites, mushrooms, elevations) add much more!  \nDungeon Gray or Expertly Hand Painted?\nYou may choose either of two finishes. \nDungeon Gray is infused with a single color that looks great right out of the box. You can embellish these tiles by adding paint yourself. We offer custom formulated paints and brushes made specifically for painting Dwarvenite.  (Please note that add-on set features like lava or water will also be gray on Dungeon Gray sets.)\nOr, for a reasonable premium, pledge for Expertly Hand Painted sets. These are completely hand painted precisely to Stefan\u2019s specifications, perfect for a Cavern, and a great complement for your other Dwarven Forge terrain, including your Dwarvenite Dungeons.\nWhy We Need Your Kickstarter Support\nDwarvenite is less expensive to produce than the classic polyresin in large production runs. But the large steel molds make up-front costs extremely high, and that makes small production runs impossible.\nWith a successful Kickstarter, we can commit to a single, large production run -- and offer these Caverns to backers at an exclusively low price. The stronger your support, the more efficient our production, and the more generous our stretch goals. If our total reaches levels close to last year\u2019s Game Tiles Kickstarter, you\u2019ll be able to cover your table in incredible new pieces!\nThe amount of your pledge is up to you. But certain pledge levels qualify for specific rewards. The cost for (ground) shipping your Caverns to a US address is included with your pledge. To ship your Caverns outside the US, an additional payment must be added to your pledge as specified below.\nThese pledge levels are not eligible for stretch goals:\n$10: Your Dwarven Forge forum account receives a Caverns backer graphic.\n$25: You will receive a Dwaven Forge Caverns Backer canvas tote. (Non-US shipping: add $25.)\n$75: 1 Dungeon Gray Cavern Set (plus graphic and tote). (Non-US shipping: add $50.)\n$110: 1 Expertly Painted Cavern Set (plus graphic and tote). (Non-US shipping: add $50.)\nThese pledge levels all qualify for free stretch goals (1 set of stretch goals for every set you back) and make you eligible to purchase add-on packs, shown here.  Each level also receives a forum graphic and a tote:\n$145: 2 Dungeon Gray Cavern Sets. (Non-US shipping: add $75.)\n$205: 2 Expertly Painted Cavern Sets. (Non-US shipping: add $75.)\n$210: 3 Dungeon Gray Cavern Sets. (Non-US shipping: add $105.)\n$285: 3 Expertly Painted Cavern Sets. (Non-US shipping: add $105.)\n$325: 5 Dungeon Gray Cavern Sets.

(Non-US shipping: add $350.)\n$875: 10 Expertly Painted Cavern Sets. (Non-US shipping: add $350.)\nPhotos of the various pledge levels are shown below (most show the Expertly Painted Sets).\nIf you would like add-on sets, please add the amounts for those sets (plus any applicable international shipping) onto your total pledge amount. Please use this pledge calculator to determine your pledge total.  \nKeep in mind you must (and can only) select a single pledge level listed in the right hand column, even if your are pledging for additional items. Please be assured that  after the campaign closes, our Pledge Manager will capture the order details.\nNote: Free stretch goals are not included for 1 set pledges.\n   \n                               The graphic below shows the amazing amount of FREE Stretch Goal pieces you get with EVERY SET you back.  So, if you back up for 10 sets, you will get TEN TIMES the amount of pieces shown below (in the paint finish you backed).\nWho gets stretch goals?\nBackers for 2 or more sets are eligible for stretch goals (a 1 set pledge does not qualify).\nWhat are stretch goals?\nMany are free individual pieces; others are optional, larger paid \u201cadd-on\u201d sets, available exclusively to 2+ set backers at especially low prices. New stretch goals unlock as we hit specified total pledge levels.\nFree Stretch Goals: 2+ set backers automatically receive one (of every) free stretch goal per every main Cavern set in their pledge (e.g. a 3 set pledge receives 3 sets of free stretch goals). The finish of your free stretch goal pieces (Dungeon Gray or Expertly Hand Painted) will match your pledge. So, if you pledge for (2 or more) Dungeon Gray sets, your free stretch goals will also be Dungeon Gray. If you pledge for (2 or more) Expertly Hand Painted sets, your free stretch goal pieces will be Expertly Hand Painted.\nPaid add-on packs: 2+ set backers may purchase as many paid add-on sets as they wish by adding the appropriate amount to their pledge, i.e. \u201cover-pledging.\u201d*  You can calculate the correct amount to \"over-pledge\" by referencing this Offer Guide and using our online Pledge Calculator.  (Buying paid add-on sets does not affect your free stretch goal rewards in any way.) \n*You may also over-pledge to obtain more than a single pledge level (e.g. for one 2-set pledge and one 5-set pledge).\nUNLOCKED!

You'll need dice and that's about it to begin your journeys through a ruined Earth. A quick list of what you can obtain through this kickstarter includes:\nThe Fall of Man Corebook with all the knowledge you need to play right at the beginning for Pathfinder with PDF conversions for 13th Age, Fate and Castles & Crusades (SIEGE).\nA Kickstarter Exclusive 32+ page bonus book full of additional \"crunch\" content for your players.\nThe Hunt: Rise of Evil original setting and possible PDF bonus books based on the social media campaign.\nA large number of stretch goal bonus PDF books from an arms and equipment guide, detailed locales, adventures and even possibly additional setting content from Ed Greenwood.\nA Limited Edition book (with glow in the dark cover) with a full color map of the United States post-apocalypse.\nThe ability to get any of the PDF books printed and shipped right to your door.\nOriginal Art pieces from our Artists.\nEven game sessions with the Fall of Man creators.\nThis book will be a 320 page tome with a black and white interior and will include:\n* The entire game/setting created by the ENnie nominated team from Samurai Sheepdog that can be played immediately. The base RPG is compatible with Pathfinder, 13th Age, Fate, and Castles and Crusades (SIEGE)!\n* 11 new races and 11 new classes.\n* Combat tracking and character sheets ready to be copied...everything you need to start!\n* A starting adventure to let you jump right in and start playing.\n* A short story written by Richard Lee Byers based on the iconic Fall of Man characters on the cover!\nWhen the world was to end, inexplicably, it did not.\nThe year is 2061, 30 years since the meteor known as Satan\u2019s Maul slammed into the Atlantic Ocean, causing what scientists predicted should have been an extinction level event.\nHowever, Earth had ties beyond those known to man. When all our technology had failed us and our world was being torn asunder, it was magic which stitched and scabbed the world whole again. Today technology and magic fight a silent war for domination; the One God of Earth battles the many gods of Gothos; the magic world merged with earth to sustain it and humans fight for survival in a world now infested with orcs, dragons, elves and even more nightmarish creations.\nWelcome to the Fall of Man.\nClasses:\nIn Fall of Man there are 11 core (starting) classes to choose from that advance through 20th level. Each has its own unique set of skills and abilities.\nArcanist (ARC): A learned spell caster who studies the arcane arts in order to work magic in the fallen world.\nAsphalt Samurai (ASI): A street smart warrior who wields both blade and gun that follows a strange tradition of ancient Bushido codes.\nCleric of the Many Gods (CLR): A divinely charged spell caster and warrior who is a devout follower and prophet for the many gods that crossed over from Gothos.\nDreamwalker (DRM): A martial artist who has connected with Mindar: God of Dreams and is able to alter reality with their waking dream-state.\nFace (FCE): A gifted and charismatic wheeler dealer who is great at bartering as well as lying, cheating, etc.\nGifted, The (GIF): A strange mutant who is naturally gifted with the powers of the arcane.\nMechanist (MEC): A technology wizard who studies the old tech stuff from before the fall.\nPriest of the One God (PRE): The divinely powered followers of Earth's only God before the many Gods of Gothos arrived.\nScavenger: (SCV): A packrat and thief of the new fallen world. Stealthy and clever with an eye for the value of junk.\nSoldier (SLD): A well trained warrior who is adept at the fine art of modern combat.\nWasteland Barbarian: (WLB): Feral mutant savages who are ferocious warriors.\nThe Fall of Man corebook will introduce Advanced and Master classes, which will be available in future supplements. Both Advanced classes, available after 10th level, and Master classes, available after 20th level, will be able to advance past the normal 20th level of most characters.\nRaces:\nHumans: Humans are the surviving native race of Earth and once dominated the planet with powerful technology. Now, the race of man is in a steep decline and competing with the other newly arrived races for basic survival.\nCanite: The Canites are said to be a creation of the stuff of the dream world.  Anamorphic canines, the proud and loyal canite race now run in packs and are well known for their ability to hunt and track.\nDwarf: The Dwarves of Earth have secluded themselves away underground and only a few venture forth to adventure. Some speculate whether this is because of their desire to live alone or due to some other, darker secrets.\nElf: Many of the Elf race were the first to head the warnings of Midnar and take action to preserve their kind in the merging of Gothos and Earth. However some others either did not heed the call or were unable to prepare and now walk the earth \u201cblasted\u201d with foul spirit and intent.\nGnome (The Twisted): Gnomes were once considered to be a happy race. Similar to Halflings in stature, the gnomes were small but had big hearts. They are now cursed in the transition to Earth with something called \"the bent.\" This has gained gnomes the terrible name \u201cThe Twisted\u201d.\nHalflings: True to form, the Halflings seemed to avoid the various afflictions that occurred to most of the other races in the transition to Earth. In fact, halflings seem to now be able to affect the world itself with their stories and song.\nHalf-Elf: Like most half-breeds, the Half-Elf is a displaced creature, especially on Earth after the fall. Sharing both Elven and Human traits, they seem to not fit in with either race.\nHalf-Orc: The Half-Orc is generally thought of as a down trodden sub-race. They are not as smart as humans and not as strong or robust as pure orcs which seems to put them at a disadvantage but they make up for it in raw tenacity.\nHanites: Hanites are a new species of being which originated from man and who will be further previewed during the Kickstarter.\nMutant (Template): In a world where technology, magic, radiation, and toxic effects exist, mutation was inevitable.  Unlike the other races, mutant is a template which is added on top of another race\u2019s abilities.\nReborn: When the first reborn appeared shortly after all the devastation, no one knew what to make of them, instantly assuming they were zombies or something worse. Their ashen, dead, cold skin and their white dead eyes made them obvious targets for undead hunters. It was not for quite some time before someone figured out the reborn were not truly undead and were not always evil or good, being much like humans in this regard.\nWhat makes this setting different: \nIn Fall of Man, it is a fight for survival.\nThe world is warped, twisted and everyone is severely flawed and conflict abounds, even between players. And through that conflict, both roleplaying and tangible game effects engage the players to interact beyond simple camaraderie around the table; it is you vs. the world (GM) and each other.  \nTechnology vs. Magic; The One God vs the Pantheon; Real vs. Imagined; all of these things collide to make a world both familiar yet new.\nCombat is harsh and gritty, but still allows for long term progression and the capacity for heroic deeds.\nAnd everything is not what it seems...  Even among the characters themselves as they evolve not just in their classes, but in their racial and physical (mutant) features.\nFrom the world's pain, we gain a place in which GM's can explore their darkest nightmares and manifest them for their players while the players themselves have the opportunity to respond in kind.\nGothic Horror and Fantasy in a Post Apocalyptic setting. That's what sets Fall of Man apart. \nSystems: This setting is based on the Pathfinder system on steroids. If you have played in a d20 system you will be familiar with the basic rules. It will also be available for 13th Age, FATE and Castles & Crusades (SIEGE), with specialists in each system doing the conversions.\nInformational Videos\nHere is a video we made discussing the Barter and Trade system that is included in the Fall of Man:\nPLAY\n\nAll backers of + levels will receive a 32 page PDF of bonus player character content including new feats, alternate class and racial features, equipment and other goodies.

Please feel free to have a look through my portfolio and contact me for any further information or samples.\nI'll try and tell you a little about myself without taking up too much of your valuable time! I have always had an interest in drawing and as a result decided that an artistic career was for me. I graduated from the University of South Australia studying Visual Communication. After a brief stint working in graphic and web design I made the move into the entertainment art industry and worked as a professional Concept Artist, Creative Director, Art Director and Illustrator/Designer for a range of clients and companies.\nHerald of Thanato\nGill Pearce My name is Gillian Pearce although I do prefer to be called Gill. I tend to lurk around online using the nicknames Hellion or Kharnate. I divide my time between my day job working in a local school and illustrating on a freelance basis. I also help out as art director for Dark Quest Games. I have been illustrating professionally for approximately 12 years now and I have numerous publishing credits in various fields ranging from book cover and interior illustration, card game artwork, role-playing game illustration and cartography. My artwork is created using traditional methods and very little in the way of computer enhancement aside from map labels and the like. My colour work is produced using a heady mix of watercolour and acrylic paint with a hint of ink and pencil and my black and white work is primarily achieved using fine-liners, although I do occasionally indulge in black and white pencil work. I like to consider myself versatile when it comes to subject matter and will tackle sci-fi, horror, fantasy scenes, figures, monsters and maps with the same enthusiasm.\nCity of Pavis\nWar Dragon\nRoel Wielinga has been described as a \"DREAMER\", a description that suits almost every aspect of the artist.

We're all hoping to see the rest of the Potion Tokens become funded.  Can't wait to see what this campaign brings. \nThere is a bit of a downer this time around though. You'll notice that the prices have gone up a little bit. Price hikes have been passed down the line to everyone in the chain of manufacturing, including us here at Potion Tokens central. :)\nIf your new to the Potion Token experience, you may ask yourself, what are Potion Tokens? \nA Potion Token is a unique RPG table-top gaming accessory that represents a great way for a table-top RPG player to keep track of his or her potion inventory during game-play. The Potion Token is given to a player by the DM (Dungeon Master) or GM (Game Master) when the player's character finds potions in an adventure. When a player uses (spends) a Potion Token, they can physically hand the Potion Token to the DM.\nNo need to erase a potion from inventory!! \nThe small spell description on the back of the potion token tells the player exactly what to do to resolve that spell. \nPotion Tokens are produced in both PLASTIC and METAL materials. Metal Potion Tokens are 1.75\" in size. (Plastic Potion Tokens are slightly smaller.)\nPotion Tokens are compatible with:\nPathfinder RPG   \n3rd Edition Dungeons & Dragons    \nCastles & Crusades  \n And virtually any other D20-based Fantasy RPG.\n-- On the FRONT of the Potion Token is a potion bottle image and a title stating which Potion Token is represented.\n-- On the BACK of the Potion Token is a flowing scroll with a small spell description of what that particular potion's spell effect is.\nMetal Potion Tokens are 1.75\" in size. (Plastic POTION TOKENS are slightly smaller.)\nThis is an image of a finished METAL Potion Token next to a medium-sized RPG miniature.\nWe are going to use the \"Stretch Goal\" format again because it works great with our type of product.  \nWhen the dollar amount for a stretch goal is reached, it then becomes one of the available choices for fulfilling your pledge rewards.   \nPledge supporters can mix and match all of the FUNDED Potion Tokens stretch goals and previously funded Potion Tokens. (\"Cure Light Wounds\" and \"Potion of Invisibility\")\n Click the Link below to check out their website.\n** Include the price of any desired add-ons into your pledge and then after the Kickstarter campaign is complete we will contact you via e-mail to ask which add-on Potion Tokens you want.\n The original art for Potion Tokens was created by professional artist Mike S. Corley.  Mike was integral in making Potion Tokens a reality. Check out Mike\u2019s Deviantart.com gallery  here: http://mscorley.deviantart.com/gallery/\n In addition, more original art was created by Professional artist Ross A. Campbell.

Imagine an experience that combines strategy, action, adventure, and RPG elements with the deep plotline of a massive single-player campaign and the 'fun' of multi-player co-op play! :D Yeah, it's pretty unique, we think so too :) \nInitially, we plan to release on PC and Mac platforms via Steam :)\n=============Gameplay=============\nIn Espionage, you don't just defend your castle with traps, units, and environmental hazards, you also have to attack other player's castles with your own troops, counter-traps and spells to make it through! This unique gameplay is the first of its kind that we know of...think of it as Tower Defense meets Tower Attacks in a real-time-strategy setting, but requiring FPS level flexibility and RPG level character development! Whew! \nLevel up your character and get cool powers, like the Ice Ring!\nPLAY\n\nAs you gain more land, your status goes up from a Serf to a Knight, to a Noble and so on, and you receive more tributes from your total owned land as well. \nWait wait it gets better yet :D You can play with other players in co-op mode to attack castles together with both of your band of units, complementary spells and gadgets and all sorts of different strategies! BUT, be careful, because if you lose a lot of units in a particular attack, your co-op partner might take the opportunity to now attack your undefended castle too!\nKeep barrels of money and goods secure in storage cellars\n=====Single Player Schmancyness!=====\nYou know the best part about Single Player campaigns? The fact that you can create amazing plot and storylines...unfortunately something we see less of that we'd like! Kingdom Espionage follows a beautiful plot that combines the the stories of 4 different characters in their 'righteous quest' to overthrow the current corrupt emperor. Full of twists and intriguing philosophical juxtapositions, the story is unlike what you're typically going to come across and is bound to make you think at a much deeper level about the world around us at economic, moral, and political levels!\nWhile that's all awesome, solo-play also offers a variety of fun modes to play in, including the 'Horde Mode', where you must survive against waves of incoming monsters to give enough time for your units to escape. Or the exact opposite, 'The Crunch' where you must attack as quickly as possible and take down all of the enemy's runners before they can leave the castle!\nAll in all, it's FUN!!\n=============Defense=============\nAs you grow, you will need to learn how to defend your land against other invaders. You do this by setting up defenses within your Castle using different traps, units, and environmental hazards.\nI'm setting up a burning coal pit next to the tar trap...not the most strategic of decisions :P\n=============Attack=============\nPlayers can attack each other to try and take over the land and money from other players. If you successfully invade another player's castle, make it past their defenses, and get your units into the inner chambers, you will be able to take over some of their land. However, you need to plan out your attacks and strategy to make an attack successful - any units you lose during an attack are lost permanently - you will need to buy new units to make up for the lost ones. And, you have a limited time in which you must make it past each castle.\nHere I just ordered a team of my archers to attack two werewolves blocking the path to my destination.\nGetting your units through the traps is challenging - you can issue commands to your units like Stop, Follow, Charge, or Retreat. Then you must time their movements while at the same time disabling different traps using your counter trap gadgets or similar strategies.\n\n\n\nListen to one of our attack themes below:\nHere I am about to use the water bucket to temporarily quench the burning coal trap.\n======EPIC BOSS FIGHTS!======\nWhat do you do when finally defeat a man-eating plant just to discover it's but a flower-bud on a MASSIVE all-consuming underground fungus? Well you KILL IT WITH FIRE of course :D Or when you've finally taken down the last of the baby dragons only to discover you've angered the mama?\nThe bosses in Kingdom Espionage are planned to be not just massive in size, but require realistic strategies and teams of units to defeat them! And if you're stuck, just team up with a buddy in co-op mode to get ahead (though we warn you it's still no walk in the park!).\n======The Future?======\nKingdom: Espionage is but the beginning of the 'Kingdom' universe, with 2 other installments planned based on the support and success we see with Espionage! So support us on Steam and Kickstarter with gusto if the ideas presented here carry the freshness with them that you've been longing for ;)\n======Oh My Gosh! It's an Ogre!!========\nWhat's a fantastical world without some awesomely fear inspiring creatures? Werewolves, HammerTusk Wolverine, Tank Ogres, Dragons (babies to teens!), Runefairies and other creatures roam the Lysterian woods, and are often tamed to provide protection to castles! Use your wits and the right strategies to take down these ominous creatures in time before they tear through your units when attack, or traps when defending!\n=============Units=============\nUnits make up the backbone of your offense. The number of units you can own are limited by the population slots you have available, which in turn are limited by your status - so as you gain land and ranks, the scale and nature of your attacks become bigger! \nConcept art for Archers\nArchers are strong against most infantry and fliers, especially when massed together. \nConcept art for infantry units\nInfantry units are strong against most units when up close, able to hold off dangerous units and expose them to archer fire.\nConcept art for Cavalry\nCavalry units are useful for large open castles as they travel fast, and are good at making it through slower traps.\nConcept art for Werewolf and Ogre beasts\nBeasts are only available at Noble and higher levels. While more expensive and requiring higher population slots, they can turn the tide of a battle very quickly. Werewolves are fast, and immune to magical effects. Ogres are slow but have massive health and take limited damage from projectiles.\nConcept art for baby dragon\nBaby dragons are available only at higher tiers of status (Duke and above). These fliers skip past most ground traps and are potent attack units as well! \nHelp us hit our Stretch goals to make beasts and dragons part of the initial Espionage release and to unlock even more units like the Dragonspawn, RuneFairy, HammerTusk, Legion Captain and more! \n=============Traps=============\nTraps are your primary means to defend against incoming invaders! The more creative and strategic you are with the placement of your traps, the better defended you will be! Like with Units, you may deploy a fixed number of traps in a given castle. \nBurning coal pits damage units that step on them. They need some time to recharge after some units being burned.\nBarricades can be used to block off pathways or to force invaders into narrow spaces. Barricades may not be used to completely block all paths.\nThe swinging mace packs a massive punch and can disable most units in a single hit!\nPush-pikes damage units that walk over them.\nTar traps do no damage but greatly slow down units that walk on them. These can be used to set up units for hits by swinging maces or archers.\nHelp us create even more traps by helping us hit our stretch goals like the Decoy, Levitation plates, rolling logs, Dragonbreath statues, Magnet distruptors and more! \n=============Stretch Goals==============\nStretch goals will enable us to take Kingdom Espionage from an awesome game, to a groundbreaking experience! \n$68,250 - We will be able to make beasts and dragons part of the initial Espionage release instead of a DLC pack!\nThis would include at least the ogre, the werewolf and the baby dragon.\n$96,700 - We will be able to include an additional counter-trap pack which will include the Decoy, the Levitation Plates, Magnet Disruptors and more! \n$107,100 - All of the above PLUS the ability to unlock more units, such as Dragonspawn! \n$117,500 - Unlock the RuneFairy unit! The RuneFairy can negate the damage from the first attack it sustains. This ability, in conjunction with its mana shield, which can be activated for a period of time, means the defender must have a series of traps that last for more than 5 seconds (for example) of speedy RuneFairy travel in order to defend against this unit.\n$127,900 - Unlock the HammerTusk Wolverine unit! The HammerTusk Wolverine is faster than other units, charging straight ahead and demolishing traps with its impervious, bony head. The HammerTusk must be attacked from the back or the sides, since the front is nearly impenetrable to attack!\n$138,300 - All the above, plus unlock the Legion Captain unit! The Legion Captain is slightly larger and stronger than the other human units, and makes other surrounding human units able to travel faster. He has a banner above his head, with a logo emblazoned on his armor.\n$139,100 - All of the above PLUS we will be able to include the Decoy Counter-trap. The decoy attracts enemy archer fire from longer distances. \n$148,250 - We will include the Levitation Plate Trap. This causes the attacker to float above the ground. This works well in combination with the arrow walls, as the attacker is temporarily rendered helplessly unable to move under fire. \n$158,100 - We will include the Mind Key Counter-trap. This is a small glass ball with the appearance of a pulsing brain shrouded in fog inside. With the mind key, the attacker can use levitation power, targeting any one of their units, to lift them and move them around. You can levitate your units over dangerous traps and to safety. The Mind Key can also be used to negate the power of the Levitation Plates! \n$167,150 - Get the Rolling Logs Trap! This trap can be set up on a wall (ideally at the end of a long corridor) and is manually activated by a pressure plate which must be placed in a separate location. Rolling logs kill nearly anything they hit. The only way to survive is for the attacking player to dodge...if possible! Rolling logs are hard to identify, but they are a one-time-use-only trap. \n$177,750 - We'll include the Dragonbreath Statue Trap, which can be placed in various strategic locations throughout the castle. These may appear to be harmless gargoyles, but similar to the arrow walls or the rolling logs, one wrong step from the attacker and this trap can damage their units severely! \n$188,000 - All the above, and get the Magnet Disruptor Trap included as well! The Magnet Disruptor pulls off attackers armor, causing units to take more damage. This trap also creates other ancillary advantages for defenders, for example the ogre's mace will be lost to him when he walks by the Magnet Disruptor.\n$200,000 - We want to create additional heroes with which the player can live their Lysterian experience. For this stretch goal, we will include the hero Menin: a 12-year-old girl with high mana reserves and lower hp. Menin takes very low damage from elemental traps like burning coals, poison, acid, lava etc. Potentially she may also have a cat-mode, where she can morph into a cat to hide and evade danger, as well as sneak into areas that others cannot. Menin is the only survivor (at age 5) of a civil conflict. The story is that a peaceful village was was ransacked by the emperors troops, and she was the only survivor, found later in the burning rubble. \n$212,000 - We will include another hero, Jos: He will be the fastest unit, able to double-jump, with decent mana and hp. He has blonde hair, medium build. Jos is a bit of a smart-alec, but his confidence is not unwarranted.\n$224,000 - In addition to the above, we will include the hero Gram: a hardy, hulking man who grew up in the mountain forests. He is physically the strongest of the heros, with melee attack and defense, high hp, and can take a lot of damage from traps and guards before dying.\n$236,000 - At this level, we will include the hero Din: a 17-year-old from Dinitri. Being from that island, he grew up around dragons, and can \"glide\" after a jump to cover larger distances (like a series of ground traps or a lava pit dug into a castle design). Din has slightly higher mana than hp.\n$280,550 - In addition to the above accomplishments, we will be able to build in a practice mode for survival/defense. In this mode, a player will be able to fight off hordes of attackers. With each new wave/level they defeat, they earn more in-game currency to build their kingdom. However, each level gets harder and one loss results in a loss of all their winnings from that time. This mode will serve two purposes: 1. A way to practice and to be prepared for the attacks of other players, and 2. Another means by which players can accumulate Daric (in-game money) to advance their kingdom! \n$330,000 - This next tier will allow us to also build in a co-op mode where players will be able to form an alliance between each other for specific attack or defense ventures (including working together to play the defense practice mode mentioned above). At least initially, the winnings will be split evenly between the two players, thus adding a layer of strategy when determining with which players you want to ally yourself. \n$450,000 - All the above, PLUS a level editor that will allow players to get building materials and build their own personalized castles and mazes (as opposed to building within the current pre-defined castle designs and other restraints). \n$570,000 - We will be able to build in a long, single-player campaign for different ranks on top of everything we have just outlined. Your character will follow a storyline where he/she must climb the ranks and overthrow and defend castles on their quest to defeat the evil Lysterian tyrant. Along the way, secrets are revealed, and the plot thickens at every turn! \n$600,000 - Beyond this stretch goal, we will build in as many additional maps as possible, increasing the bounds of the Lysterian universe. If this goal is hit, we will be able to include at least one more map but depending on your generosity, additional islands and continents may be made available and made accessible by ships/boats! \nWAY beyond? - We will continue building new characters, heroes, traps/counter-traps/spells, beasts, castles, castle building materials, etc. There is no limit to how massive this kingdom can become!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe greatest obstacle we face right now is not in the production of the game, but rather in the amount of 'polish' we can apply to it. \nAs can be seen in our visual/technical prototype, concept art, and feature list, we have a LOT that we've already done in terms of the core functions of the game.\nHowever, the difference between a playable game and the GREAT game is the 'polished' attention to various aspects and details. \nIf we can reach some of our stretch goals, we will be able to turn Espionage into the masterpiece that we know it can become.\n\nAs can be seen, we have already developed far more than the concept art and gameplay. Kingdom Espionage is not just an idea at this point - we have funded this ourselves to make sure you know you are supporting something that will TRULY be released soon. The gameplay, unit models, animation and design - majority of this work is complete. \n\nAll in all, the risk taken by you as a supporter is minimal at this point, and yet you have the chance to be a part of something that redefines and creates a new genre of gaming! \n\n\nQues - What if the game just doesn't 'take' off and become really popular?\nAns - Well, for one we are working feverishly to make sure that it DOES become very popular, and if we are funded fully, then we will start out with an obvious advantage in form of the wonderful gamers like you who believe in our vision as well.\n\nHowever, with all that aside, we have 3 major installments planned in the 'Kingdom' series. We need just ONE of the 3 to succeed to bring massive success to the entire series since they will be tied seamlessly into a single universe. \n\n\nAll in all, we are all VERY familiar with running huge projects - in both the software, and the game world. We've faced and overcome many struggles before and we sure won't be stopping just due to some other minor issues this time either!

All original stretch goals unlocked!\nUpdate: Pledges of $20 or more will now also receive the Ultimate GM Screen II from our friends at Fat Dragon Games!\n\"Honestly, we wouldn't have been able to tell the stories we wanted to tell in Pathfinder without the Advanced Bestiary.\"\nF. Wesley Schneider\nEditor-in-Chief, Paizo Publishing\n\nIn 2005 Green Ronin Published the Advanced Bestiary for the d20 System. It was a monster book that took the idea of templates and ran with it. The Advanced Bestiary featured over 100 new templates and sample monsters built using them. It was a terrific toolkit and added value to every monster book GMs already owned. For years people have been asking us to do a Pathfinder version of the Advanced Bestiary and with your help, we are going to do it!\n  The rules revisions are already well under way. The question is, what will the book\u2019s final format be? We are starting with the assumption that the book will be a 264-page hardback with a black and white interior like the original, and that we\u2019ll keep the book\u2019s existing art. Really though, we want to give you a full color hardback with all new art! That\u2019s built into the stretch goals of this Kickstarter, so the final format is up to you all!\n\nUpdate: Full color printing and all new art are unlocked! \n\nYou Can\u2019t Eat Accolades! \nThe Advanced Bestiary got great reviews as soon as it was released. This was in the later days of the d20 era, when it was harder to impress people and much harder to have a hit book. The critics loved it and sales were solid. Mission accomplished, right? Well, no, as it turned out. The Advanced Bestiary and two other titles (The Black Company and Egyptian Adventures: Hamunaptra) had the misfortune of coming out when our fulfillment company (Osseum Entertainment) was dying and stealing money from our sales to stay afloat. Those three big, expensive-to-print products all sold pretty well\u2014and we saw not a dime of that money. We were, of course, still on the hook for all the associated bills: writing, editing, printing, art, etc. What should have been a triumph thus turned into a disaster. I remember figuring out at one point that for every dollar we paid the designer, Green Ronin lost three dollars. The \u201cOsseum Debacle,\u201d as we came to call it, nearly killed Green Ronin Publishing. We managed to survive though and slowly paid down all of our associated debts. \nThe fact that the Advanced Bestiary became a cornerstone book for Pathfinder development has thus always been bitter sweet. We were certainly flattered that Paizo used the Advanced Bestiary in so many of its own books and we were glad players and GMs got so much use out of it. You can\u2019t eat accolades though, so for years I had hoped we could bring this book back and actually turn a profit on it. \nEarlier this year we did a highly successful Pathfinder Kickstarter for our Freeport city setting. Last month I hired Owen K.C. Stephens to be our Pathfinder developer for Freeport and more. I believe now that the Stars are Right for the return of the Advanced Bestiary! Let\u2019s make it happen, Pathfinder fans! \nThe Stretch Goals \nAs I mentioned, we want this book to be full color and featuring all new art. We\u2019ve baked that into the stretch goals and we are revealing them all so you can see what we ultimately hope to achieve with this campaign. We are also keeping expansion of the book fairly limited by design because we want to have the finished product out to backers next July. The more we might add, the longer this would take, so we are capping the new material at 32 pages. Note, however, that there were originally five web enhancements to the Advanced Bestiary and we\u2019ll be including all of those in the new book. \nd20Pro Add-on\nd20Pro is a Virtual Table Top (VTT) program that allows pen-and-paper gaming groups to play online and now you can buy d20Pro files for the Advanced Bestiary for only $10. Simply add $10 to your pledge and you'll get the files when they are released. They will be available to the public later for $15, so this is a great deal for d20Pro Users.\nFantasy Grounds Add-on\nYou also have the option of Fantasy Grounds support for the Advanced Bestiary! Fantasy Grounds is an application acting as a virtual online gaming table. If you'd like Fantasy Grounds files with your Advanced Bestiary, just add $10 to your pledge!\nThe Rewards\nHere are the reward levels for the Advanced Bestiary!\n\nHISTORIC BEAST: You get a PDF of the original (3.5 d20 rules) Advanced Bestiary. All higher pledges also receive this PDF. \n\nE-BEAST: You get a PDF of the finished Advanced Bestiary for the Pathfinder RPG. You (and all higher pledges) also get the Ultimate GM Screen II from our friends at Fat Dragon Games!\n\nHEROIC E-BEAST: You get a PDF of the finished Advanced Bestiary for the Pathfinder RPG, plus Hero Lab files for the whole book.\n\nEARLY BIRD BEAST: The first 300 people to pledge get print and PDF copies of the finished Advanced Bestiary, plus the Hero Lab files, for only $45!  \nFREEPORT E-BEAST: You get a PDF of the new Freeport: The City of Adventure book for Pathfinder (from our previous Kickstarter) in addition to a PDF of the Advanced Bestiary and its Hero Lab files.\n BEAST: You get a print and PDF copy of the Advanced Bestiary for the Pathfinder RPG.  \nRETAIL BEAST: This is a special tier for retail stores only.

Add $30 for international stores.\nHEROIC BEAST: You get a print and PDF copy of the Advanced Bestiary for the Pathfinder RPG, plus Hero Lab files for the whole book. \nFREEPORT BEAST: You get a print and PDF copy of the new Freeport: The City of Adventure book for Pathfinder (from our previous Kickstarter) in addition to a print and PDF copy of the Advanced Bestiary and its Hero Lab files.\nBEAST MASTER: You get to work with developer Owen Stephens to create a new sample creature for one of the book's templates. Owen will work with you to create an awesome creature/template combo and to name the resulting monster! You will be credited in the final book, of course. Choices are subject to our approval. You also get a print and PDF copy of the Advanced Bestiary and its Hero Lab files.

Our second Kickstarter, Freeport: The City of Adventure for the Pathfinder RPG, is well under way and should release of May of this year.

The two projects share a developer (Owen Stephens) but have completely separate design teams. We thus believe that risk should be minimal.\n\nGreen Ronin has been in business since 2000 and in that time we've published over 150 books.

The Potion Token is given to a player by the DM (Dungeon Master) or GM (Game Master) when the player's character finds potions in an adventure. When a player uses (spends) a Potion Token, they can physically hand the Potion Token to the DM. \nNo need to erase a potion from inventory!!\nThe small spell description on the back of the potion token tells the player exactly what to do to resolve that spell.\nPotion Tokens are produced in both PLASTIC and METAL materials. \nPotion Tokens are compatible with: \nPathfinder RPG \n3rd Edition Dungeons & Dragons  \nCastles & Crusades\n And virtually any other D20-based Fantasy RPG.\n.\nMetal Potion Tokens are 1.75\" in size.

The point of this Kickstarter is to get it off the ground. The bulk of the book was written at the same time as the \u00c6ther Core Book, but it has evolved and changed with the system. Now we are ready to give it the finishing touches that it deserves along with the polish and shine that we have so badly wanted for it.\n\u00c6thermancy is a complete magic book that builds on the skill system that is at the heart of \u00c6ther. It allows for an incredible degree of creativity and flexibility with your spell caster, whether you are using the system for typical wizards, clerics, or psychic users; all of them are treated the same in the \u00c6thermancy book, at least mechanically. The book contains ways to incorporate magic into your existing campaign, it contains 30 adventure hooks, a fully fleshed out adventure, and over 200 spells. (FINAL COUNT 257 unless someone else pledges in the next 2 minutes, then it's more!)  It blends seamlessly with the \u00c6ther system; making it feel like a continuous inclusion rather than something clunky and bolted on.\nWhat is \u00c6ther?\nFrom Kevin Rohan, the system creator\n\u00c6ther is a critically acclaimed universal role playing system that allows you to do anything. The Core Book is geared for modern games, but it is easily and readily adaptable for any time or technology level, from the Stone Age to the very far future. It is a skill-driven system that has amazing character creation flexibility and the possibilities for advancement are virtually limitless. But, you don't have to take our word for it, see what some of our customers have said!\nFrom Amazon:\nFind those at Amazon.com.  For a few more, click the link to see our reviews at DriveThru RPG! Want to know more about the system itself, visit the Silver Gryphon Games website!\nWhy are we Kickstarting this?\nWe need additional funding for art. We want the presentation of this book to be our best ever, and that means more polish than we've ever done before on the various print editions. Virtually all of the Kickstarter funds are going for art, with a very small portion of them going to establish other features of the book such as the ISBN codes and identifiers.\nIn the spirit of Kickstarter, we have several stretch goals, all of them revolve around more content for \u00c6thermancy and more choices for you at your gaming table. More spells, more caster types, more archetypes, and more creatures are made available at the individual stretch goals. As we approach those new goals, we will tell you more about them, but we can say that we have a lot planned for this project! Without being Kickstarted, these other goals may never see the light of day, so this is a rare opportunity to actually drive content and tell a publisher exactly what you want!\nWe do have some art already, provided by Dennis Darmody, and for a taste of what's due to be inside, we present you with the Explode spell and an illustration for it!\nFast breakdown of what you can get!\nWant to see this larger?\nFunding and Stretch Goals\nWe will be updating this section as this project grows, and we have a number of stretch goals that are designed specifically for \u00c6thermancy and supporting information for using more magic in your game world. Ranging from more \u00c6thermancer archetypes, spells and adventure hooks, all the way up to fantasy bestiaries and beyond, this will be a keystone project for Silver Gryphon Games and will help guide our production for many months to come!\nDaily Expansion Goals:  We really want this to succeed and we're willing to put our mouth where your support and money are!  Starting on September 17th, we decided to add 5 new spells to the main book every time we have more than 5 backers in a day.  Additionally, every $1,000 dollars in pledges we receive will generate another 5 spells for the main book!  Considering there is (at the time I'm writing this) already 210 spells in the book, that could end up being a huge spell selection!\n$4750: \u00c6thermancy is Funded! We will contact the prospective artists immediately and we will get art going. If all goes right, we may be able to update you with concept sketches or even full art, depending on when the goal has been hit!\nAdding spells until the last minutes!\n$6500: The first stretch goal of the Tome of the Unknown \u00c6thermancers is unlocked! Each of the smaller stretch goals for this companion volume will add another main \u00c6thermancer archetype with three variants, spells, adventure hooks, and pre-generated \u00c6thermancers, ready to use in your campaigns! Our expected date of delivery on these is April of 2014 due to the art concerns, but we may be able to get these out sooner!\nThe spell casting mechanic of \u00c6thermancy works by the player choosing which of the eight attributes their character uses as a Casting Attribute, and each of these eight \u00c6thermancers pivots off a different attribute, adding a wide range of possibilities to your gaming table! The first of the Unknown \u00c6thermancers is the Sorcerer, and others unlock as stated below! If all eight \u00c6thermancers are funded, the book will be completed with its own fully fleshed out adventure!\n$11,750: The second major stretch goal is the Grimoire of Forgotten Lore! Each small goal unlocks another type of magic, adding para-elements to the five core elements of fire, earth, water, air, and energy included in the core book, and it also adds life magic, death magic, and summoning to the mix! Every small goal unlocked gives you another 30 spells, three \u00c6thermancer variants that deal specifically with the type of magic unveiled, and it also gives three adventure hooks per caster type! Our expected date of delivery on these is June of 2014, again, due mostly to art concerns.\nIf all eight sections of the Forgotten Lore are unlocked, there will be an adventure added to the Grimoire of Forgotten Lore to complete the book!\nWe have many further goals in mind for this project and as we get closer and closer to unlocking them, we will reveal more information about them, but here's a taste:\n$19,500: Catalog of Mythical Beasts - Contains up to 295 creatures of an \u00c6thermantic nature, each of them is fully illustrated! One of the mini-stretch goals of this volume also contains a new type of \u00c6thermancer, the artificer!\n$49,250: Reliquary of Forsaken Relics - Contains up to 210 relics from many places, origins, and times, all for use in your \u00c6thermancy adventures!\nThat is just a taste of our goals, we do have further goals in mind, and we will release more on them as we approach the appropriate funding levels!\nPixie Dust Miniatures\nCaroline at Pixie Dust Miniatures has agreed to do miniature \u00c6thermancy books for us, and they make perfect charms for necklaces, bracelets, zippers, Christmas ornaments, or just to have for a keepsake! There is only one pledge level that you get a small \u00c6thermancy book for backing us, and that is the $25 pledge level. We did this for those who wish to support the project, but may not be interested in purchasing the physical copies of the book. We thank you for that, and we want to know that we appreciate your support!\nAll others who wish to have one of these items, simply add $20 to your pledge when you determine a level of support. The books are made of real leather (sorry, no material substitutions for those who prefer a non-animal based material) and other non-toxic materials and measure approximately 1 inch by 0.75 inches by 0.2 inches.\nCaroline is also providing a special award for those of you who pledge to our top two levels; a miniature wizard's desk complete with scrolls, books, and bottles! As with the spell books, everything is hand-crafted from leather and glass and a few other secret materials! The table measures 5.25 inches wide by 1.5 inches deep by approximately 4 inches tall.\nQuestions and Answers!\nWe here at Silver Gryphon Games have never had a \"fire-and-forget\" mentality when it comes to a product, and a Kickstarter project is no exception. Last summer with our dice, we were answering questions and met quite a few of our fans. With this Kickstarter, we plan on having on-line game nights revolving around \u00c6thermancy, Q&A sessions with Silver Gryphon online, and we will of course be available via emails and the Kickstarter message system to provide any answers you may need!\nThese events will be scheduled via our Facebook page and announced at the Silver Gryphon Games home page. We invite you to check with us regularly, but we will try to keep everyone updated via the Kickstarter as well.\nDelivery of Product\nWe will be waiting for art before we can do the final layout. After that we will deliver the backer awards and then we will wait a short time to put the standard editions of the PDFs and books into circulation. Additional supplements unlocked via the stretch goals may have differing delivery dates, and those will be updated as we are able to firm those dates up.\nAs of now, we are confident we can begin delivering \u00c6thermancy in February of 2014, and every two months, we expect to be able to deliver the next expansion book (Tome of Unknown \u00c6thermancers, Grimoire of Forgotten Lore, Catalog of Mythical Beasts, etc) every two months thereafter. All backers will have their products sent to them in the mail before we release \u00c6thermancy to the public, and we're expecting about two weeks later, we will release the book through our normal sales channels.\nFor the expanded material, we will be releasing those in a similar manner. All backers will have their PDFs and physical copies sent out to them at least two weeks in advance of Silver Gryphon Games making them publicly available.\n\nSpecial Thanks\nWe'd like to be sure to thank Caroline at Pixie Dust Miniatures for providing the spell books and the wizard table!

Soft cover copies of The Garden of Sin start at $25.00 shipping included (unless its shipped outside of the U.S.)\nAlso, make sure to watch our video!!! There's a really cool and creepy teaser trailer that tells the entire introduction of our book! Using the art and poetry directly from the first pages of The Garden of Sin!!! Enjoy...\nPlease, take the time to read more about our new 7 deadly sins inspired horror story book... we want nothing more, than to bring this into the hands of horror fans, dark art fans, Dante's Inferno fans, and anybody that enjoys the stranger things in life!!! We have spent the last 3 years working hard on putting our story together piece by piece, entirely through visual art and poetry, and it is finally complete! Please help us get funded so we can get The Garden of Sin printed, packaged and shipped straight into the hands of horror fans all over the world!!! If we don't reach our goal by the deadline, we will not be able to get our book printed and ALL contributors will then be refunded...so the only thing you could possibly lose, is getting your hands on a copy of The Garden of Sin this October!!!\nThe Garden of sin takes YOU, the reader on a journey straight into the heart of Hell. With a story reminiscent of Dante's Inferno. As Virgil guided Dante through the Inferno, you, as well are guided through Hell. But In The Garden of Sin your travels are led by a sinister cloaked figure, known as The Shadow. Your tour guide, and narrator through The Garden of Sin. On your voyage, The Shadow brings you deeper and deeper into the suffering of the sinners, as you experience many different levels (or \"circles\") of Hell, each representing one of The seven deadly sins. All the way from The Wood of the Damned, where your journey begins, through the Abyss of Lust, to The Slaughterhouse of the Gluttons, down to the deepest part of Hell, where The Shadow Judges the damned for their sins, right before your eyes... Is your conscience clean enough to face The Shadow?\nThe Garden of Sin is set up very much like a children's book, or fairy tale book, where every page is illustrated, with writing on the left side, and illustrations on the right, some being double page spreads. All of the illustrations throughout the book were done drawn traditionally by hand with pencil and paper, and none of the images inside the book are digital. The entire book is written in a poetic, verse style, most of it being narrated (by The Shadow), where as some pages are direct expressions of each sinner representing one of The Seven Deadly Sins (ex. Lust, sloth, wrath etc.). Each of the 7 deadly sins are divided into vastly different chapter environments , where the style of font will change according to the atmosphere set by the artwork. The Garden of Sin will be available in soft cover or hardcover format, and will be  120 pages (excluding thank you's, dedications, author/illustrator notes) . \nHere are some page examples:\nChapter Zero: The Wood of the Damned - page one (example of what the book will look like when printed. Like a children's book, the poetry is on the left page, and the illustrations are on the right page)\n\"The Fourth Confession: Lust\" - (another example of what the inside of the book will look like, poetry on the left page, illustration on the right)\nThe Garden of Sin officially went into production in January of 2010, when we, the creators (artist Tyler Kendal Faraone and Writer Meghan Dawson) were introduced, and instantaneously began working together to form some kind of collaboration, unknowingly to us what would turn into a 3+ year project to create The Garden of Sin. It began as a series of 7 illustrations portraying each of The Seven Deadly Sins, accompanied by 7 pieces of poetry expressing the suffering of each of the 7 sinners. Only months later, even before all of The Seven Deadly Sins series were completed, we created The Shadow, and formed a layout, and vision of what our \"own Hell\" would visually look like. Quickly thereafter, it became realized that we would divide our creation of Hell into 7 different levels, for each of The Seven Deadly Sins. Making each of the levels of Hell vastly different from each other. With inspiration from what each of the 7 deadly sins definitively, figuratively, and symbolically meant to us, we were able to create the nightmarish environments that you will get to experience in The Garden of Sin.\nIts been 3 long years, but after all the hard work and dedication we've both put into this, we are now ready to have our book printed and read. All of the illustrations are complete and finalized, scanned, and ready for printing. All of the writing has been revised, edited, and stylized with 9 unique fonts, and is also ready for printing. We've done a lot of research on different printing companies, and have finally found the printer that will make our book everything that we want it to be, and everything that it deserves. The Garden of Sin is ready for the world to see, its right at your finger tips, we just need a little funding to get this all rolling!!!\nWe are asking for $9,000 to get our first run of The Garden of Sin printed. It will be a very limited run, but its a start. With the $9,000 We will be able to satisfy all contributors with our rewards listed, and we will have just enough product left over to keep the The Garden of Sin alive. We have set a higher stretch goal in hopes to ensure The Garden of Sin gets into even more hands, and also to give us enough to say thank you, to all of those who donated and made this possible, with the DVD version of The Garden of Sin, The entire story told in video format, as described in the video above!!!! We would absolutely love to be able to make that happen for you, and would love to have you be a part of our project, by helping us make The Garden of Sin possible!\nWe've posted the Teaser Trailer for The Garden of Sin once again here below, so it could be viewed in HD. So please check it out to see it at the quality it was meant to be enjoyed at! Turn off the lights, turn up the volume, make sure to set the video quality option according to your monitor, and enjoy!\nWe hope you've enjoyed our book preview!!! We had an absolute blast working on it!!! Especially during the voice recordings!!! We would love to be able to make our entire book into a video on dvd (or digital download) the same way we made the trailer!!! But we can only do that if we hit our stretch goal of $35,000, and we can only get there with your help!!! So please help us make our dream come true, help us bring our vision to life! Even if you cant afford to donate at this time, please share our page with your friends and family, every little bit helps!!!\nWant to get a copy of The Garden of Sin?

I carve each one of them up a bit here, and a bit there, then I install hardware such as nails, staples, wires etc.\nSIN HEAD (back) Every SIN HEAD is produced differently every time, painted by hand, changing styles and moods as well.

This piece means a lot to us for that reason alone. This image was never actually used in The Garden of Sin, but was a HUGE inspiration in the creation of one of the chapters!  \nPlease Help us achieve our Ultimate Stretch Goal of $35,000\n........If we reach $35,000, we will have enough funding to make a DVD version of The Garden of Sin, done in the same style as the Teaser Trailer above, with the help of Director/Producer Ryan Baldwin (The talented guy that did our kickstarter video). It will take us roughly 8-12 months to create a cast, do all the voice recording, and all the video editing.

At the same time, The Way of Tree, Shadow & Flame seeks to maintain the dark sense of mystery, uncertainty, and danger of the original system, while providing players and Master Creators with options and advice for creating and fleshing out three-dimensional characters to set forth on perilous quests in search of fortune, glory, or perhaps some greater cause, all within a realistic fantasy milieu. As The Secret Fire was always meant to be a free-wheeling game of adventure loosely bound by its rules and empowered by the varied imaginations of its various participants, so this book is the result of contributions from many veteran game designers responsible for some of the most popular game systems and campaign worlds in the history of the hobby.\nThe Way of Tree, Shadow & Flame contains new Callings (Assassin, Druid, Huntsman, Knight-Errant, Skald), new prayers, spells, and rituals, new Traits and Trademarks, expanded Energy Point options, backstory and relationship generation tables, new equipment, rules for building and running your own domain, new monsters and talismans, new ways to use the Elder Gods and the Character Wheel, optional rules to customize your campaign and increase immersion, random encounter tables for sandbox play, advice for MCs, and more!\nStretch Goals\n$4000 \u2013 David \"Diesel\" LaForce artwork added!\n$5000 \u2013 Stan! cartoon added!

In \"The Awakened\", this could be you.\nSixteen exciting stories pull you into the diverse and unusual world of Grimaton, where the twin moons above might mean a lifetime of change. Join our celebrated authors as they explore the world of The Awakened and spotlight the heroes, the villains, and the magic; where a random few may find themselves bonded to an animal companion for life, or might find they are the possessor of weird and powerful magic they could never have imagined. How these exceptional few are treated and how they learn to use those unasked-for powers... Well, that is the adventure we have started here.\nExperience the highs and lows of becoming an Awakened, decide if you would use your power for good or for evil, and grow with characters who will make you proud... or make you angry.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nI created this world over ten years ago but never pursued it; now it is time. I love this setting, and the reason I do is not because it came from my mind, but because those fifteen other writers made it come alive and feel so real to me. The emotions I felt as I read through their stories were fantastic and I cannot wait to go back and read again as both a writer and a fan.\nTake a look at the tiers to the right and see how you would enjoy The Awakened best; as an eBook, paperback or hardcover; being part of the next book (which is already planned and includes exciting changes); talk one-on-one to a publisher and author; heck, I will fly to you with an armload of books from the Dark Quest library and we can hang out for a weekend!\nNext, take a look at the stretch goals and see what we can do with your support --we can bring you more short stories, add art to the print copies, and guarantee more books in the series-- so take a chance on us and we will not disappoint!\nThe stories are written, edited and in layout. Now what we need is you: we need you to help us keep these characters, this world, this dream, alive. By pledging and showing your support, we will have the supreme honor of being able to write for you again and again.\nYou can do that for me.

She is also member of the writers' cooperative Monumental Works Group.\nDarrin Drader - The Outcast has been an avid fan of the fantasy genre since reading The Hobbit somewhere around age ten. As a bored sixteen-year-old, while sitting in English class one day, he decided that he was going to be a writer when he grew up. Unlike other fanciful notions that had come and gone, this one stuck. Before graduating from high school, he wrote numerous stories. In college at Washington State University, he enrolled in several writing classes, and co-founded an extra-curricular writing group. After the university, he committed to chasing the dream and embarked upon a career in tabletop roleplaying game design. This led to employment with Wizards of the Coast and work on such Dungeons and Dragons products as the Book of Exalted Deeds, Forgotten Realms: Serpent Kingdoms, and D20 Apocalypse.

After growing up in a household with a writer, and being made a beta-reader from an early age, she graduated to writing articles, stories, and eventually whole books. These days, most of her writing is loaded with supernatural events, superheroes, steampunk ladies, dragons who don't look like dragons, and other oddities. Her books for Wizards of the Coast explore the dungeons and graveyards of the Forgotten Realms, and she's known in the D&D fiction community as \"the quirky one.\" She thinks the \"quirky\" may have something to do with topiary, wererats, small dogs, and the liberal use of skeletons in key scenes. When not writing, Rosemary cruises the shelves of Seattle's many bookshops, hangs out in different coffee emporiums, or sits in darkened theaters. One of her earliest memories is listening to a recording of Mary Poppins and being spooked by the \"Feed The Birds\" song.\nTy Johnston - Assassins of Opportunity was born and raised in central Kentucky.

He claims to have a harem of first readers, and an army of bloodthirsty, opium-addicted, yetis who keep the children off his lawn. He subsists on a diet of mercury, sulfur, arsenic salts, and cheese.\nAllegations that he is a master of Sinanju and a leader of the World Crime League remain unproven. No records can be found for his patents of the interocitor, the Mr. Fusion home reactor, the flux capacitor, or the oscillation overthruster.\nMr. Redman is a multiple winner of National Novel Writing Month.

A writer from a very young age Rai liked to provoke thought and spark controversy with her speeches and articles (much to her teacher\u2019s dismay). Several years and a family later, she has turned that passion inward to fantasy fiction. Her writing has found its publishing debut with Dark Quest Books as a contributing author for The Awakened.  She currently makes her home in central Florida with her ever encouraging husband, a wee one who is most certainly of Fae decent and three very demanding cats.\nDark Quest Books\nDark Quest, LLC was originally formed to promote the explorations of medieval reenactment through silversmithing, leatherworking, and various other crafts. In 2001, the corporation spawned off a new division responsible for game development. Since the majority of the staff previously involved with the company were long time gamers, this was an obvious evolution in the grand scheme of things. Little did the designers know that this gaming hobby would expand into such a growing business. The balance kept shifting over the years; the more staff we add the more we found an imbalance. In 2008, Dark Quest Books was brought into existence to handle fiction products spawned from our roleplaying game settings. There is some overlap between Dark Quest Games staff and Dark Quest Books, but for the most part they operate separately.\n\nInstant library backers go here to look at all the books available from the publisher: Dark Quest Books\n\nPraise for 'The Awakened':\nIf you hunt around, you can still find something fresh in the worlds of magic \u2014 something different \u2014 and the stories in The Awakened can prove it.\n-Matt Forbeck (Deadlands, Guild Wars and Eberron novelist)\nThe Awakened anthology is a fantastic romp brought to you by writers both new and those you already know.

In 2012 we released a popular and critically acclaimed trilogy called Rise of the Drow, but it\u2019s only available in PDF format. We\u2019d like your help to transform this into a single fully illustrated, full color, premium edition hardback book with loads of expanded content. Even if you aren't familiar with the Rise of the Drow trilogy, you can grab an introductory pdf adventure to get in on the action and help do your part!\nThe Mushroom Forest will have even more action between the guardian golems and the chokers that are attempting to defeat them. Holoth will have more information about visitors, houses, and all that takes place as the PCs work their way through the city either by stealth or by fighting, and face the final house. Embla will be expanded, telling you more about its trade, its influence on the region, and the battling dwarves who are attempting to save their town.\nYul\u2019s lair, already mysterious, will have great depth, greater challenge, and be an environment that the PCs will truly learn to fear. The Demi-plane of Venom, deadly already, will become a greater challenge that everyone will truly remember.\n\n\nHowever, what I\u2019m sure you want to know about is the all-new material that you\u2019ll be getting. So where do we start? Well, triple ENnie winner Todd Gamble will be giving you new maps, both of all the current areas, plus many more of the additional action, and we\u2019re aiming for cloth versions to use as fantastic players aids.\nWe have guest authors bringing you all-new environments and encounters, such as an entirely new drow house that will play a challenging part of the action in Holoth, a complete Undersea with ancient pirates, lost dwarves, and a ship that travels through the entire Underworld, a scene-stealing, PC-chomping deep dragon, and its realm, the dwarven Underworld capital of Stoneholme will be introduced for your PCs to perhaps visit, and certainly explore at a later date. The history of the Vidre, allowing deep immersion into their alien world will be given for the PCs to experience.\nThe hidden dwellings of other denizens that live and die around those two cities of Embla and Holoth will be introduced so that allies and enemies alike can be found as the PCs travel through the Underworld. The Rift-Realms of the undead members of the various Holoth drow houses will be given greater strength and emphasis. Other planes that the Drow Spider Temple touches on will have gateways introduced and expanded information.\nUNLOCKED $5,000: Hero Lab files of all monsters and NPCs.\nUNLOCKED $6,000: Endzeitgeist, Paizo community reviewer extraordinaire (over 1000 reviews!), to author a section \u2013 The ecology of the Vidre, the primary adversaries in Usurper of Souls.\nCorrupted Dwarf by Rick Hershey\nUNLOCKED $7,000: New Interior Art featuring the talented Mr. Rick Hershey of Fat Goblin Games and the always impressive Mr. Jacob \"ProdigyDuck\" Blackmon.\nRobert Gruver of Skirmisher Publishing\nUNLOCKED $8,000: Robert Gruver, of D-Infinity and Skirmisher Publishing to author a section \u2013 A new batlike race exclusive to the underworld, and mechanics for echolocation in combat.

Its newly awakened essence spreads as a pollution across the light-less waves of a sprawling underground sea, threatening a twisted reign of madness among those unfortunate enough to be touched by the corruption of its gathered power. Already counted among its unwilling servants are a colony of lost Dweorg. Once part of a clan that fell to a victim to a long forgotten calamity, these dwarves have built a massive kingdom upon the toiling of slaves. Widespread rumors of a dark cult, strange creatures, and of the Dweorg's obsession with unearthing an unknown relic lead adventurers into a cursed place that even their hated enemies, the drow, would fear to tread.\nBrian Berg of TPK Games\nUNLOCKED $11,000: Brian \"Necroblivion\" Berg to author \"House Invidious\" \u2013 The sick mind behind Total Party Kill Games will be bringing us a new drow house for use within the environs of the Rise of the Drow adventures.

As the PCs travel from the surface to Embla, from Embla to the outskirts of Holoth, and then even into the city itself, they will encounter the citizens of this subterranean realm as they go about their business, whether that is a problem with a previously unseen ooze, a deep gnome hermit in the middle of a 100 year retreat or a government-sanctioned assassin returning, injured, from a kill, with an angry mob on her tail.\nThis deck of cards is made up of over 120 encounters that can be dropped into Embla, Holoth or any of the caverns and tunnels that run from the surface to the drow city. Prepare for the unexpected, for your players are quite likely to encounter it!\nNote that all backers at the $45 pledge level and above will get a Underworld Encounter Card Deck PDF, but if you wish for a physical copy of the Underworld Encounter Card Deck, you may simply add $10 to your pledge total.\nUNLOCKED $32,500: Full Faction Integration\nGet your NPC into the hardbound book with a lucky few seeing their NPCs written into the main story alongside the PCs!\nThe concept for Faction Designation is for each pledger to come up with a human, a dwarf, or drow they would like to see appear as an NPC in the appropriate section of the trilogy.\nThe factions include:\n\nHumans from Rybalka, and elsewhere, which include troops sent to help the PCs, slaves held in Holoth or even agents of Yul and his undead cult.\n\nDrow within Holoth, but maybe who are spies elsewhere. They could be members of House Gullion, House Invidious, or perhaps just renegades.\n\nDwarves within Embla, or perhaps returning traders, or even allies from Stoneholme who have decided to help Embla despite Stoneholme's lockdown!\n\nAll that is needed is a name, a class or activity (Profession/Craft), and a two line description. The NPC will then appear as someone the party can meet and interact with. We are intending to use them as clear encounters for the PCs, so we'll be including chances for Diplomacy, Intimidation, a question or two, or perhaps a purchase from your character.\n\nIn addition, if this stretch goal is reached, we will be producing a special supplement with more than 100 detailed \"random encounters\" suitable for all the main settings. We will be looking to add the best of the NPCs sent to us as the focus of these encounters.\n\nFinally, Stephen Yeardley will be taking the five most interesting NPCs, as decided by the Adventure-a-Week team, and write them up as an alternative party for the GM to use from the very outset of the adventure. Players will encounter this party early in the prequel, and there will be encounters with them throughout the entire Rise of the Drow trilogy. They will grow in stature, and feature as allies or enemies, as the PCs decide. If chosen, Stephen will be in touch with you to get your thoughts on how you would like to see your NPC grow into an important part of the Rise of the Drow!\nTaking the PCs from levels 18-20, this epilogue closes the curtain on the Rise of the Drow trilogy once and for all.\nUNLOCKED 35,500: Epilogue\nA PDF version of the Rise of the Drow Epilogue \"The Commander of Shadows\" will become available as an add-on.

Alone in its deep-buried chamber, resting on a permanently chilled bier, the rush of spirit into it caused it to react as if electricity had passed through it, and the gasp that escaped its lips would've frozen the bones of the most hard-bitten of adventurers.\nMoments later, the dead body of the old Matron Mother arrived next to the now-activated clone of Maelora. The woman looked down at the broken body, still clad in its martial finery ,gave a wry smile, and said to herself \",My vanity blinded me, clouded my judgement, but it won't happen again.\" She striped the body, her former self, and quickly dressed in the equipment. Now the clone still feels weak, but her new strength is rapidly flowing through it, and soon she will be ready. \nNow Maelora glances around the chamber, a 10 feet-per-side cube, and spots what she is looking for. Touching five of the six sides of the chamber, other similar cells appear, each with a body on a sarcophagus - loyal troops, from decades ago, waiting for such a moment as this. Then the Matron Mother touches the final wall, directly in front of her, and door appears. Beyond is a chamber, colossal in size. Within rests the body of a spider, a fully developed, fiendish, monstrous creature that was gifted to Maelora for when revenge was required. The body looks tired, damaged, but Maelora knows it is from beyond the gates of the Abyss, and will fulfill its obligations. \nMaelora reaches for a amulet that is pinned to the doorframe. It burns with venomous cold fire, as gifts from her goddess always do. The Matron Mother steps forward, loudly chanting the liturgy that will activate the amulet. As the words reverberate around the massive hall with all the power they contain, the acid-green gem at the center of the amulet gets brighter, blindingly so; but Maelora continues. As the final phrase passes her lips, she thrusts the goddess's token deep into the spider's body, the passion flowing from her every pore. Then, imperceptibly at first, the corpse stirs; a twitch, a flex of a leg, and then the zombie spider rises. Maelora laughs, uncontrollably, and turns away, her arms raised; \"No, it won't happen again. No more mistakes!\" From back in the cell where her broken previous body lies, the sound of bones and flesh rending can be heard. \"To me!\" Maelora snaps the command, and the feeding stops. From the room steps one, two, three, four, five drow-shaped nightwalkers. \"My real children, let us take back what is truly ours.\"\nUNLOCKED $37,500: Epilogue in Print\nA print version of the Rise of the Drow Epilogue \"The Commander of Shadows\" will become available as an add-on.\nNote that all backers at the $45 pledge level and above will get a PDF copy, but if you wish for a print copy, you may simply add $15 to your pledge total.\nUNLOCKED $40,000: Free 3 month subscription to Adventureaweek.com!\nExisting AaW subscribers will have these bonus months added to their current subscription.\nEligible to all pledge levels $45 and above!\nNOTE: After the Kickstarter ends you will receive a survey.

I'm John Wick, and I'd like to introduce you to Wicked Fantasy.\nWicked Fantasy is a brand new setting book focusing on ten races. It has been a year-long project for myself and Gillian Fraser, re-creating the \"generic\" races found in most fantasy roleplaying games. We re-designed humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes, and halflings, and then turned our attention to orks, gnolls, ratmen, goblins and kobolds. Ten races, all with a wicked twist.\nOur re-envisioning effort met with much critical applause with reviews calling the new races \"brilliant,\" \"sometimes near genius,\" and containing \"lessons every gazetteer should look at.\"\nGillian and I have been working over a year on this project, releasing each race as a PDF download. Both of us are excited about the project for many reasons. First, we wanted to bring a fresh perspective to the races. Let's face it, some of the races (men, in particular) are a little boring, even cliche. We wanted to \"spice up\" the existing races. \nSecond, we wanted to show that the Pathfinder system is flexible enough to tell deep and moving stories, not just simulate skirmish level fighting. Gillian and I both felt too many new classes, archetypes, etc. focused on combat. We wanted to expand the races beyond just fighting, to show them in a wider context, and provide mechanics to make them \"real\" in gameplay. Not just a \"+1 to Diplomacy,\" but something as robust and real as the Cleave Feat. The phrase \"Social Cleave\" was a very popular joke while we were writing the races, but it summed up our goals nicely.\nOf course, Jill and I created a unique team for this project. I might even say \"uniquely qualified.\" I've spent years in the game design industry, turning expectations on their heads with games such as Legend of the Five Rings, 7th Sea and Houses of the Blooded. I made orks into heroes with Orkworld, and did the same with your household kitty with Cat: A Little Game about Little Heroes. My unorthodox approach to RPGs--not just thinking outside the box, but throwing the box out the window--has created what others have called some of the most innovative RPG designs in the last twenty years.\nWhen I teamed with Gillian, I found someone who not only loved Pathfinder, who not only wanted to put a distinctive twist on the races, but who also had a keen mind for mechanics and mathematics. Over the course of the year, we both taught each other a lot about game design, Pathfinder and storytelling.\nWe didn't want to make a \"better Pathfinder.\" We wanted to add our own voice and vision to an ever-expanding game system. We looked at each race and asked ourselves, \"Why are people fans of this race?\" We found that key element, then turned the volume up to 11. A game about culture. A game about dangerous choices. A game that asks the question, \"What does it really mean to be a hero?\"\nFor an example of what we did, here is the PDF for The Reign of Men. Check it out!\nThis is the Pathfinder we wanted to play. And we found out we weren't alone.\nWhen we released the first PDFs for Wicked Fantasy, the reactions were intense. We got a ton of good reviews and a few negative ones, but one thing was certain: everyone was passionate about what we were doing. That told Gillian and I we were headed in the right direction.\nDavid BS at RPGnow.com said of the Reign of Men: \n\"It's good to see the humans strut their stuff first, for a change! And they do it with style!\"\nAs for our look on halflings, Thilo G. wrote: \n\"Not only is the re-imagined halfling awesome... halfling secret agents rock!\"\nAt rpg.net, joewolz gave Orks: Children of Pain 4/5 Stars, saying: \n\"Mr. Wick has been doing this for a while, and of course he produces top-notch work. The implied setting for the orks is evocative and interesting.\"\nWe've got tons of rewards folks, and I mean tons.\nEveryone who pledges $25 or more gets THREE COINS FROM THE REIGN OF MEN. You get one copper, one silver and one gold coin. You can see pictures just below. Now, they aren't real copper, silver and gold, but they sure do look like it. And they're heavy. You drop these down on a tavern keeper's bar and they're gonna sound like you'd expect them to sound.\nAnd since one of the rewards is GETTING YOUR FACE ON A COIN, the ones below have placeholder faces.\nWe've got CUSTOM WICKED FANTASY DICE made exclusively by Chessex for this project. You get a set of dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12 and d20) in gemini blue steel!

In fact, for each $20 you add, we'll add another dice set! Get a set for everyone in your group!\nWe've got CHARACTER JOURNALS! These handy little books have your character sheet, a Wicked Fantasy quick reference rules guide plus a black and white map of the world of Wicked Fantasy! Plus, plenty of space for information about NPCs, locations, important plot poins and other notes.\nWe've got add ons! And it's the stuff gamers want! Dice, maps and a GM Screen!\nIf you add a map, the dice or GM screen to a PDF only order only, and you are ordering from overseas, please add $5 for shipping.\n$20 / $25 - Wicked Fate!\nA stand-alone B&W soft-cover book including information on all the races, the map and everything else, but translated into the Fate System by Mark Diaz Truman! $20 Domestic / $25 International\n$20 - Dice!\nJust add $20 to your order and you get a full set of Wicked Fantasy dice! In fact, if you want multiple sets, just throw in another $20 per set you want. A dice set includes one of each: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12 and d20.\n$20 - GM Screen!

The screen will be unsigned, however.\n$50/$60 - Additional Book\nIf you want another copy of Wicked Fantasy added to your order, just add $50 for domestic orders or $60 for international orders. We'll throw in another copy you can share at your gaming table!\n$25 / $30 - Wicked Fantasy Companion\nEveryone gets a PDF copy of the Wicked Fantasy Companion, but you can pick up a physical copy of the 8.5''x11'' softcover book by pledging an additional $25 Domestic / $30 International. The Companion has the Savage Worlds and Dungeon World conversion, fiction by Mike Stackpole and Matt Forbeck, and a Wicked Fantasy Adventure and GM Advice from John and Jill!\n$20 - Full Color Map!\nOur incredible graphic designer, Jessica Kauspedas (Blood & Honor, Big Book of Little Games) has designed a 24x36 map for Wicked Fantasy. It is gorgeous. Color coordinated, easy to read and accessible, hang it on your wall with pride! We're adding to the map all the time, but take a peek at this (unfinished) draft.\nWF Map\nIn addition to the book, every contributor also receives a digital CD of soundtrack music from the world of Wicked Fantasy. The soundtrack contains both \"race songs\" and \"tavern songs.\"\nRace songs are themed after the ten races. Each race has one. For example, below you can hear \"Goblin Caravan.\"\nOr, if you prefer, check out one of our \"tavern songs.\" These are tunes typically played in a tavern in the Reign of Men. For example, take a listen to \"The March of Dervin's Volunteers.\"\nOr, if you're looking for something dark and dangerous, here's a little a dark elf chanting \"A Prayer to the Darkness.\"\nFor our book, we've enlisted two fantastic artists: Aaron Acevedo and Mauro Mussi. Hopefully, we'll be able to add even more art to the book! (See stretch goals, below.)\nRoddun: Scourge of the City\nThe Reign of Men\nElves: Guardians of the Wood\nUvandir: The Pride of Craftsmen\nWe also made videos for each of the races, looking at our decisions, reflecting on the results. You can watch all the videos at my Youtube Wicked Fantasy playlist!\nWicked Fantasy Playlist on Youtube\nFor example, for dwarves, we picked the word \"stubborn\" and applied it to all the racial traits. We boosted their saving throws, we made them resistant to will-changing magics and we just made dwarves hard to kill.\nFor humans, we focused on \"self-determination.\" Men are not bound by fate nor destiny: they make their own way in the world. They believe in philosophy and reason and science. They are their own masters with no gods, only a deep belief that humans can be greater than they are. We created feats, archetypes and other mechanics to reflect this.\nWe did the same for all the races. We made elves romantically tragic, we made gnomes true spirits of the earth, and we made halflings James Bond. Yes, halflings are James friggin' Bond. (You should watch the video below. It'll make sense.)\n1) The Material is Awesome\nIf I do say so myself. But please, let me explain.\nAs a designer, I've always enjoyed collaborating with others, but I have to say working with Gillian has really brought out some of my best work. Our disagreements led to places we never thought we would go and created opportunities to do really fantastic work. That inspired our artists as well. Just take another look at the art up there. Mauro and Aaron worked hard to create art that matched the steam and fire Gillian and I were stirring up. This is a work of passion, and you can feel it in the words and pictures, steaming up from the pages.\nAlso, you can use Wicked Fantasy in just about any fantasy RPG. You don't need to use the Pathfinder rules. Many folks have told us, \"I'm using this for Dungeon World!\" or \"I'm using this for Burning Wheel!\" or just about any other fantasy RPG you can think of. So, if you aren't a fan of Pathfinder, don't feel like you can't use the book. You can!\n2) Expanding Pathfinder's Horizons\nGillian and I really wanted to see just how far Pathfinder could go. We bent, twisted, stretched and kicked the system hard. We wanted to expand it to show that the system could really take on all the elements of fantasy storytelling. At the same time, Gillian kept reminding me, \"What will this class do in combat?\" We never lost sight of the role that combat plays in Pathfinder games. Wicked Fantasy is a game about race, politics, clashing philosophies, mystery and discovery... but in the end, someone is going to draw a sword. So, we wanted to expand that element of Pathfinder as well. We thought outside the box, looking for new and different ways to incorporate different kinds of characters into combat.\n3) Breaking the Rules\nWe hope Wicked Fantasy will show other Pathfinder fans how diverse and powerful the system can be when you push the envelope. Wicked Fantasy isn't just a list of new classes, archetypes and feats: it's a whole different way to play the game. \nWe wanted rules that worked within the structure of the system, but looked like nothing else. We wanted to innovate. We wanted to create change. We wanted to inspire others to do the same: to look at the Pathfinder system with fresh eyes and do something different!\nGillian and I did that. We did it because we wanted to create a world and races that we wanted to play, but we also wanted to add some fresh ideas into the mix. To throw a brick through the window. To get the Pathfinder community to notice. And hopefully, to get people to think differently about what Pathfinder could do.\nNow, all ten races are collected for the first time in one book, and with your help, we can add a whole ton of new material as well. We're looking forward for an opportunity to make Wicked Fantasy a book you'll be proud to own. We want to add a \"wicked twist\" to your existing campaign. And here's how we're going to do it.\nOur last Kickstarter Project, \"Wilderness,\" was a huge success in large part due to Mark Diaz Truman. He's going to help us with this project as well, handling all the shipping and production, so Gillian and I can focus our creative energies on meeting our stretch goals. If you want to take a look at that project, you can do so here.\n$10,000 - UNLOCKED! MORE ART AND ARCHETYPES!\nIf we reach this stretch goal, we will double the art in the book. More full-color art from the amazing Mauro Mussi!\nAlso, Gillian and I will be creating TEN NEW ARCHETYPES: one for each race. Archetypes are specialized character classes, each filling a distinct niche in the adventuring party. Instead of a wizard, you play a witch! Instead of a fighter, you play a swordsman. For example, we could add an ork antipaladin, human inquisitor and a haffun burglar. You'll find out as we add them. \n$12,500 - UNLOCKED! HERO LAB!\nIf we reach this goal, Gillian makes a Wicked Fantasy add on for Hero Lab!\n$15,000 - UNLOCKED! SAVAGE WORLDS CONVERSION RULES BY JOEL SPARKS!\nIf we hit the $15,000 mark, Joel Sparks will write a SAVAGE WORLDS conversion for Wicked Fantasy!\n$17,500 - UNLOCKED! DUNGEON WORLD CONVERSION BY SAGE LATORRA AND ADAM KOEBEL!\nIf we hit this goal, the authors of Dungeon World -- Sage LaTorra and Adam Koebel -- will write a DUNGEON WORLD conversion for Wicked Fantasy!\n$20,000 - UNLOCKED! THE DARKNESS & THE ENEMY\nIn all the PDF releases, we hinted at two evil powers in the world: \"the Darkness\" and \"the Enemy.\" If we hit this stretch goal, John and Jill will add these two new races to the book, further deepening the mysteries of the world of Wicked Fantasy.\n$22,000 - UNLOCKED! Novella by John Wick\nIf we hit this stretch goal, John will include a digital novella from the world of Wicked Fantasy for ALL PATRONS! The novella will be in PDF form and may also contain more fiction from other authors you may know...\n$25,000 - UNLOCKED! MIKE STACKPOLE!\nMike Stackpole\nIf we unlock this tier, award-winning author MIKE STACKPOLE will add a short story to the collection! And there are more authors waiting to get unlocked. Don't make them wait too long!\n$27,500 - UNLOCKED! 10 MORE ARCHETYPES!\nIf we hit this goal, John and Jill write TEN MORE ARCHETYPES for the book: one new archetype (specialized character class) for each race.\n$30,000 - UNLOCKED! MATT FORBECK!\nMatt Forbeck\nIf we unlock this tier, author and gaming legend MATT FORBECK will add a short story to the collection!\n$32.500 - UNLOCKED! 10 More Archetypes!\nIf we hit this stretch goal, Jill and I will add ten more archetypes to the book. That includes the human senator, the roddun sewer rat and the goblin wife!\n$35,000 - UNLOCKED! Wicked Fantasy Companion!\nIf we reach this level, we'll be releasing The Wicked Fantasy Companion! It will include the Savage Worlds and Dungeon World conversion docs, the novella, short stories, \"the WF map pack,\" and GM Advice (written by John and Jill)!\nEveryone gets this as a PDF, but if you want a physical copy, you can get one as an add on for $25. Of course, this only unlocks if we hit $35k. The book will be 8\"x10\", B&W and softcover.\n$37,500 - UNLOCKED! Wicked Fantasy Adventure by Jill and John!\nIf we hit this stretch goal, Jill and John write a starting adventure for your crew!\n$40,000 - UNLOCKED! Wicked Fate!\nIf we hit this stretch goal, Mark Diaz Truman writes a stand alone conversion for Wicked Fantasy using Evil Hat's very popular Fate System! \nEvery backer receives a PDF, but if you want to get a physical copy of the book, we're offering it as a $20 add on!\n$50,000 - Santa Vaca!\nIf we hit this stretch goal, John will release his brand-new roleplaying system based around the D&D Open Gaming License. It's D&D! WITH A WICKED TWIST!  Every backer receives a PDF of this when John releases it.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've been a professional in the game industry since 1995.

More than just a thieves guild, the book provides details on operation, range of influence, adventure hooks, and numerous tools for GMs and Players to get involved right away. There are even quick reference cards you can buy, along with special guild dice. How ****ing cool is that?\nThe characters come from all backgrounds, including criminal, civil, and even political. The guild maintains a wide array of members, including at least one wizard and a few politicians \u2014 to keep things orderly and all that. Each has a deep background, linked to other members of the guild. This interwoven design promises for a realistic and complex web for your organization. Which in turns means months, if not years of rich game play.\nEach character in the book includes game information for old and new editions of the world's favorite fantasy RPG, including Pathfinder, but not 4th.\nWhat makes this project unique, in addition to the levels the contributors can have within the guild itself, is that the size of the project actually grows. With each contribution (and with near-daily updates on where the project stands), the book may actually get bigger. The guild starts with 20 characters, but more members are added to the book, based on both milestones and contributor levels. Eventually, as many as 100 more characters can be added to the book.\n100!\nThe Guild\nThe guild is more than just a collection of NPCs. It's a complex network of interlocking relationships. Each character has something to offer players, the other NPCs, and the gamemaster's campaign. With detailed histories, ambitions, goals, and relationships, A Gallery of Rogues is a rich tapestry of characters.\nThe Art\nEric Lofgren is a long-term figure in the gaming industry and all the artwork inside the book will be done in Eric's patented black and white style. Each NPC comes with it's own piece of art. Here's a picture of a dwarven thug.\nThe Size\nThe book is a minimum 80 pages, that grows as each milestone is hit and contributors add more NPCs to the project. Potentially, with 100 NPCs, the book would exceed well over 200 pages. At present, we are looking at a minimum of 108 now, if not closer to 120.\nThe Scope\nThe sourcebook also includes a history and overview of the criminal guild, including their spheres of influence in the fictional city it is set in. Each character in the book includes game information for old and new editions of the world's favorite fantasy RPG, including Pathfinder, but not 4th.\nThe Milestones\nREACHED!\nAt $3,000, A Gallery of Rogues becomes funded. It includes at least 20 criminals, though at last count the number was 28. In addition, a new reward level allowing for a color interior book to be printed also becomes available.\nREACHED!\nAt $4,000, A Gallery of Rogues includes a shiny color cover by Eric Lofgren or a mystery guild member.\nREACHED!\nAt $4,500, A Gallery of Rogues includes Fate-Core game stats for each of the NPCs as well as an elegant social interaction system to replace your musty old d20 woes. That's right. A complete new game mechanic.\nAt $5,250, A Gallery of Rogues includes 10 more criminals and a map of the guild-house, complete with secret passages and all the other goodies a secret order of thieves might have.\nAt $6,000, A Gallery of Rogues includes a 6-page adventure/initiation called \"the Gauntlet,\" which introduces new recruits to the guild.\nThe following items can be added to your pledge, just add the dollar amount and send us your selection. We'll do the rest.\nAdd $10 to any level ($35 or higher) to receive a color version of the book. The interior will have a gunmetal blue tint.

I'll include an option in the survey after the Kickstarter ends, and you can choose 3.5/4E/Pathfinder.  Don't worry - I got you covered; no edition warring here!  Just be aware that the 4E version isn't a single compiled edition, and it's the Pathfinder edition which will have the new art and stuff].\nCLICK HERE TO READ ABOUT OUR FINAL STRETCH GOAL!\nThe final, \u00a345,000 stretch goal!\nThis page is divided into four sections - FEATURES, BONUS REWARDS, STRETCH GOALS, and BOLT-ONS.  (Also note that a good way to keep up with minute-to-minute updates is to follow me on Twitter where I haven't stopped talking about this for days...)\nAs you may know, EN World was hacked in December 2012. The entire site was destroyed, and I'm building it again from scratch. While the basic functionality is there (news and forums), much of the functionality built up over a decade was lost. I need to hire developers to recode all that cool stuff, but that takes time and - more importantly - money. While EN World ain't going anywhere, I'm turning to the community with whose help we can restore much of what was lost within a few months.\nMonte Cook said \"EN World is a good cause\"; Green Ronin's Chris Pramas said \"EN World has been a great center of gaming community many years. I had to back Rebuilding EN World on Kickstarter\"; Paizo CEO Lisa Stevens said \"Glad to help EN World get back up on its feet!\"; and Ryan Dancey said \"The ENWorld community is an asset to the whole hobby. Helping them get back up on their feet is just the Right Thing To Do. Back this Kickstarter.\"\nOur goal, put simply:\nEN World will be FAST, it will be RELIABLE, and it will have AWESOME FEATURES. It will also, most importantly, STILL BE AROUND FOR YEARS TO COME! And we all want that, right? Right?\nKickstarter staff very kindly said to me: \"Normally, we don't accept website projects, but we talked about what you're doing and we think rebuilding a community website through Kickstarter is a great use of our platform.\"\nI'm calling the hacking \"The Great Breach of 2012\" and the Kickstarter backers \"The Defenders of the Wall\". Gear up, and take your place on the wall now!\n[Lots of people have been asking about backup strategies -- I've added that info to the \"Risks & Challenges\" section below].\nAs a community website, I feel it appropriate that this Kickstarter use the Kicking It Forward system.  This means that 5% of the profits will be spent supporting other RPG-related Kickstarters as a way not only to give a little back but also to foster more cool RPG stuff!\nHere are some of the things that need writing, and the funding targets for each.\nOur goals are quite modest.  We're not asking for the millions or hundreds of thousands that some other RPG Kickstarters have raised.  For example, the first thing - the server optimization and security overhaul - is only \u00a3300 (or about $480).  I've put both UK and US currencies in the descriptions below.\nPre-Funding: New Server\nI've already purchased a brand new, powerful, server, which will be going online this week (being the week this project launches, 13-19 Jan). That bit I've funded myself in advance, and we should be seeing the benefits of it before this Kickstarter ends.\nSite Optimization and Security (\u00a3300/$480)\nFirst and foremost, the immediate plan includes hiring a professional to optimize the entire site, database, and server.  I hired someone to do that late last year, and it worked swimmingly well, but all that work was lost shortly afterwards.  This is actually the most important thing, and so is first on the list.\nCampaign Manager (\u00a3500/$800)\nThe Campaign Manager is a collection of tightly integrated campaign-management tools including a campaign wiki, journal, links and files, picture albums, calendar system, and more. Together, they make a functional and convenient campaign website. Various tools for the GM include permission and privacy settings, the ability to contact players via PM or email, inviting and booting players from the campaign, and more.\nWe have 285 campaigns being run in the campaign manager!  That's 285 active campaigns and GMs who badly need the features returned!\nYou don't actually play your campaign in the campaign manager (well, you could if you wanted, I suppose) - its purpose is to organize your campaign, schedule events, store and distribute information, discuss topics outside the actual game itself, and so on. It's designed for both tabletop and online play. It doesn't matter where or how your campaign takes place.\nDice Roller (\u00a31000/$1600)\nOur dice roller is not only attractive, it is also secure; there is no way for players to cheat it while using it in an online PbP game.  It's one of EN World's most popular features - our play-by-post (PbP) players make hundreds of dice rolls every month.\nOGRE  (Online Generator Randomizer Engine) (\u00a31500/$2400)\nEN World's Online Generic Randomizer Engine (OGRE) is a powerful, flexible framework to create your own random generators and share them with other EN World members. You can create anything from the very simple (a random color generator which rolls a d6 to choose a color) to something very complex (such as an entire, detailed populated village with homes and businesses).\nWe built this in 2012, and there was a whole pile of random generators created by a variety of talented people.  I created some planet generators for space RPGs, someone made a pirate generator, and there were town generators, room generators, NPC generators, and more which all referenced each other.  It was horrible losing all that, because they were such fun to make and use!\nThis is accomplished by the creation of two types of object: tables and generators.\nOnce someone creates a table or a generator, it is available for use by anyone else creating their own tables and generators. In this way, generators can reference and include other generators as part of their own output. So if Bob has created a table which picks a random color such as green, blue, or red, and Alice has created a table which picks a random object, such as box, table, or book, Eric can create a generator which references both of those pre-existing tables to generate an object of a random color, such as a blue box or a green table.\n\nIn this way you can create random generators for your tabletop gaming needs. From random elf names to potion descriptions, to entire treasure hoards and NPCs. \nGamers Seeking Gamers (\u00a32000/$3200)\nOur extensive Gamers Seeking Gamers system has map and distance searches, and with which many gamers met up and formed groups and games.  All the latitude and longitude co-ordinates of members who added themselves to the GsG system are still sitting safely in the database, which means we can be up and running with thousands upon thousands of gamers upon launch! \nIt really is the most comprehensive, fully populated system of its type on the entire internet, with tens of thousands of gamers already in the system, just waiting for the code to be rewritten! \nWhat's this - more stuff? The \u00a325 PDF Reward Level Keeps Growing!\nBONUS ITEM - Tournaments, Fairs, & Taverns for the PATHFINDER RPG\nWe've produced an updated, revised version of our best ever selling book, Tournaments, Fairs, & Taverns.  Originally for D&D 3.5, this exclusive Pathfinder edition is not available for sale anywhere else.We're adding this to the \u00a325 pledge.\nThe reviews for the D&D 3.5 version of this book were universally glowing!  Folks have been begging for a Pathfinder version for years, and now here it is.\n\"One of the best sourcebooks I ever laid my hands on - you can use it in any Fantasy/DarkAge Setting.\" [from RPGNow]\n\n\"This is one of the most universally useful books I have ever seen. It is also a fun read.\" [read at RPGNow]\n\"Tournaments, Fairs & Taverns is one of those extremely usable books. It\u2019s the type of supplement that\u2019ll see use in more than one campaign, more than one gaming world. It\u2019s the type of supplement that can be grabbed and used by a GM working on a scene on the fly and can be used by a GM in the planning stages. Fortunately, T, F & T is good enough that you\u2019ll want to use it in all these occasions.\" [read at Geek Native]\n\"I loved the electronic version so much I had to order the print version for quicker reference.\" [read at Amazon]\n\"I still have fond memories of this 74-page book. I have tried to find a way to use it in every one of my campaigns.\" [read at RPG Centric]\nThere are many more, but we don't want to bore you!\nWild Spellcraft was our first ever real product.  It was released in RPGNow's first days, and shocked RPGNow owner James Mathe by selling hundreds of copies within hours.  Originally for D&D 3E, we are now updating it for Pathfinder and including it in the \u00a325 EXCLUSIVE PDF reward tier. You should expect this within 3 months of the project's end.\nCONFUSED about what's included at the \u00a325 (and above) PDF level?   At present it's well over \u00a3200 worth of stuff; that's an awesome deal.\nTOURNAMENTS, FAIRS, & TAVERNS for the Pathfinder RPG\nAdmiral o' The High Seas for Pathfinder and D&D 4th Edition\nWar of the Burning Sky 700-page compiled for D&D 3.5\nFive ZEITGEIST adventure path adventures for Pathfinder or 4E (your choice)\nWhat's the Pirate Ship Like, Anyway?  from Raging Swan Press\nVillainous Pirates from Raging Swan Press\nWild Spellcraft for the Pathfinder RPG\nThe Town of Kalas and the Castles & Crusades Quickstart Rules from Troll Lord Games [also please see Troll Lord's own Kickstarter, which is awesome, too!]\nNEW!

Plus the Savage Mojo bundle pictures below - an adventure, and the largest PDF set of map tiles ever in the form of The Leviathan!\nPLUS -- the O.G.R.E. mobile app, which EVERY backer will get!\nPlease note that stretch goals will take longer to provide than the core rewards. I have given rough estimates below.\nGoodness me!  We hit those goals quicker than I dared hope!  I guess it's time for a stretch goal.  This one's for the PATHFINDER fans amongst you, especially those fond of chaos and wild magic...\nUpdate - we made the \u00a33000 stretch goal, which means that everybody who pledged \u00a325 or more will get the Wild Spellcraft PDF.  Thank you - that's astonishing! \nNew Stretch Goal - \u00a36000: MORE OGRE POWER! -- ACHIEVED!\nThanks to you, we achived this stretch goal, and O.G.R.E. will have the additional scripts and functionality to make it truly awesome!\nThe O.G.R.E. system  is something you need to see to appreciate. Its usefulness can't be exaggerated; it's a crowd-sourced, ever-growing library of interrelated random generators. It's a \"generator generator\". Creating and sharing random tables and generators of ever-increasing complexity is easy! Honestly, you could create a generator to detail an entire town, and it could call upon already existing tables and generators that others had made before you - descriptions, names, stats, anything you can think of. The utility of this system is really hard to convey, but once you see it you get it!\nNew Stretch Goal - \u00a39000: Server Upgrade (and you get THE PERTURBED DRAGON Season 2!) - ACHIEVED!\nSo we have another stretch goal to announce!  This one's a little different to the usual RPG PDF type goal/rewards.  In 2012 we produced a cartoon series.  It was six episodes long, and featured an adventuring group hanging out at their local tavern, playing an RPG called \"REAL LIFE\".  It's called THE PERTURBED DRAGON, and we are very proud of it.\nTo raise some more money for a new server upgrade (we have a new one on its way, but we can add stuff to it to make it faster!), we will make a second season, taking everything we learned making the first, if we reach \u00a39000.  This means shorter, snappier, tighter episodes; more animation frames; and guest stars!  We even have a guest star lined up - you probably already know who Monte Cook is, but if you don't, he helped design D&D 3rd Edition, Planescape, just finished a half-million dollar Kickstarter for his own RPG called Numenera, and a whole bunch of other things in a long, long list of achievements.  Well, Monte has agreed to appear in an episode of The Perturbed Dragon (we're toying with the idea of having him play an artist called Monet Cooke; but he might play himself).  Also appearing will be the winner of our BATTLE OF THE BARDS competition, the wonderful singer Mary Crowell who won with the incredibly catchy song \"I Put My Low Stat\", to sing in it.\nSo, the new stretch goal is \u00a39000 for a server upgrade; if we make that goal we'll make a cartoon.  That's some more money we can spend upgrading the server already en route to us (making the site even faster than it was going to be!) and also helps us arrange a server maintenance contract for a year.  Please help us!\nKickstarter backers will get this before everyone else!\nNew Stretch Goal: \u00a311000 for a server maintenance contract (and you get a 4E PDF megabundle!) - ACHIEVED!\nI've set a new goal which should appeal to the D&D 4E fans among you. We've got some solid Pathfinder material already in the stuff you're getting (and even some Castles & Crusades stuff), and there will be more if we manage to keep this Kickstarter trucking, but for the moment this one's for the 4E fans. Darklight Interactive has donated what can only be described as a pile of stuff. I've made another of my awesome (read; not awesome at all) infographics below to show you what's in it; but here's the list:\nAdventures:\nA Hero's Journey (level 0, D&D 4E)\nDeath's Edge (level 0, D&D 4E)\nThe Dragon's Master (level 5, D&D 4E and Pathfinder)\nThe Endless Winter (level 12, D&D 4E)\nThe Heart of Fire (level 12, D&D 4E, \"megacampaign\" of 135 pages; we reviewed this on EN World last year -- \"I was very impressed with The Heart of Fire, and I think a lot of gaming groups can enjoy an adventure of this quality. While there are some familiar tropes in this fantasy adventure, they are put to good use making a plot which is fun and exciting, as opposed to being too obvious. The adventure blends a \u201cnew school\u201d sand-boxy encounter series with an \u201cold school\u201d mysterious dungeon delve quite seamlessly, and there is a lot of play sessions packed into one dynamic mini-campaign.\")\nMap Packs:\nM1: The Wayside Inn\nM2: The Ring of Stones\nM3: Crypt Entrance\nOther:\nItems of Legend (D&D 4E supplemental)\nYou don't have to do anything to get all this.  If you pledged \u00a325 or more for the PDF bundle, it will be automatically added as soon as we hit \u00a311,000.  We have 26 days, so there's a good chance we'll do it!  \nThank you all again for this wonderful response.  It's both humbling and gratifying at the same time!\nCourtesy of Darklight Interactive, all this gets automatically added to the \u00a325 PDF bundle if we hit the target of \u00a311000!\nNew Stretch Goal: \u00a315000 for the O.G.R.E. mobile app! - ACHIEVED!\nThe OGRE mobile app will be free to EVERY Kickstarter backer!\nYou will have read about OGRE above - now imagine you're running your game and you need a random elf name.  You grab your phone, hit a button, and you've got one.  Or ten.  It was there along with the potion description generator, the random weather generator, the planet generator, and the hundreds of other generators all created on EN World by users of both the website and the app! \nOGRE stands for ONLINE GENERIC RANDOMIZER ENGINE.  There's info about it above, and documentation for the web version here.\nIf we hit \u00a315000, I'll have mobile version for iOS and Android made.  If you're a backer (at any level), you'll get it free.  It'll also be on sale in the appropriate app stores.\nThe potential for this application is amazing!\nNew Stretch Goal - \u00a321,000 to unlock the exclusive EN World dice bolt-on! - ACHIEVED!\nThis stretch goal works slightly differently.  I'm lucky enough to be able to offer exclusive EN World dice (pictured below) as a separate bolt-on alongside the t-shirts, as well as an automatic bonus reward for some higher pledge levels (\u00a3100+).  But I can ONLY do that if I make a certain minimum order.  The stretch goal, therefore, allows me to make that minimum order without being worried about not selling enough of them.\nSo it works like this -- if we hit the \u00a321,000 goal, I'll bulk order the dice, and then begin offering them as a separate bolt-on.  I know it sounds a bit odd doing it that way round, but that insulation ensures the Kickstarter doesn't *lose* money, which would defeat the purpose!\nThe good bit for backers of \u00a3100 or more is that you will get a black EN World d20 automatically included in your reward package as a bonus if we make that target!\nNew Stretch Goals - \u00a327,000 and \u00a329,000 to unlock print versions of WILD SPELLCRAFT and Tournaments, Fairs, & Taverns! Plus \u00a330,000 for new art! - ACHIEVED!\nThis stretch goal took a bit of juggling of schedules and resources, but it's a very cool one!\nThe two new Pathfinder PDFs, detailed above, are incredibly useful.  But I would like to make them into gorgeous, colour softbacks!  So the deal is this:\nIf we manage to hit \u00a327,000 I will produce a full-colour softcover version of Wild Spellcraft!\nIf we manage to hit \u00a329,000 I will produce a full-colour softcover version of Tournaments, Fairs, & Taverns\nIf we manage to hit the lofty heights of \u00a330,000, I will commission a bunch of new colour art for both!\nAs you know, if you've pledged the \u00a325 PDF deal or higher, you're already getting the PDFs - guaranteed.  You will still benefit from this, though - because your PDF will benefit from the new art and layout being commissioned for the print version!  So the PDF you're already getting will look better!\nAnd if you've pledged \u00a3100 or more, guess what?  I will send you one of those softcovers (your choice) for FREE as a bonus item.  Yup, all you have to do is let me know at the end of the Kickstarter which you want. (Hey, and you're already getting an exclusive black EN World d20!)\nBoth softcovers will also be available for purchase separately at your online vendor of choice (RPGNow, Amazon, DTRPG, etc.) at a later date.\nAll that IF we hit the goals of \u00a327,000, \u00a329,000 and \u00a330,000 respectively.  That's quite the challenge - but these books are awesome and useful enough that they deserve to be on your bookshelf!\nNew Stretch Goal - \u00a336000 for FAFNIR's TREASURE! - ACHIEVED, BABY!\nThis latest reward/stretch goal is courtesy of the fine folks over at Fate of the Norns.  Please pay them a visit!\nNew Stretch Goal - \u00a339,000 for an OSR Gem - the 1977 4th Edition Tunnels & Trolls PDF!\nVery kindly donated by the fine folks at Flying Buffalo!\nBolt-Ons are optional bonus items that you can add on to your existing pledge.   Simply add the appropriate amount to your pledge.  So, if you have the \u00a375 pledge and you would like a t-shirt, you'd alter your pledge and increase it to \u00a395.  If you want two black d20s, you'd add \u00a310.  Note that backers who have pledged \u00a3100+ automatically get one free black d20.\nFor t-shirts, please add \u00a35 if you're not in the USA (sorry - that's where they'll be shipped from!)\nFor dice, shipping is free in the USA and the UK. For up to 10 dice total, please add \u00a35 for Canada and Europe, \u00a310 for the rest of the world excluding Australia and New Zealand, and \u00a320 for Australia and New Zealand (sorry!) Add the same again foe each additional 10 dice or multiple thereof!\nAt the end of the Kickstarter, you'll need to let me know which bolt-ons you chose.  Don't worry  - I'll be sending out a survey, and you'll be able to note that you selected a bolt-on!\nDice - set of d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20 (blue/green dice assorted randomly): \u00a320\nDice - single black d20: \u00a35\nT-shirt: \u00a320\nMen and womens' t-shirts, exclusive to this Kickstarter!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be EN World's third Kickstarter, after we successfully raised funds for Admiral o' the High Seas (a naval sourcebook for Pathfinder and 4E) and To Slay a Dragon (an adventure). For this particular Kickstarter, I'll be hiring coders to specifically rewrite certain features to specification; the most challenging part of that is locating reliable coders within the budget, something I've had a great deal of practice at over the last decade. To that end, I have already sourced these coders in order to ensure that, should the funding be raised, progress is quick.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges I've discovered working on Kickstarters is the management of stretch goals -- in the unlikely event that we manage to exceed our target, it's important not to set stretch goals which drastically inflate the time period required to provide rewards (which goals like \"OK, instead of a 32 page book, it will now be a 500 page book!\" tend to do). The current stretch goals are all rooted in that core functionality we lost; any later stretch goals, should there be any, will not affect the time required to provide existing rewards.\n\nThe final - and most difficult challenge - will be that of reaching out to the community, to gamers, to publishers and garnering the support I need to make this happen. I do know that the EN World community has proved itself to be incredibly generous in past years, and that many of my publishing friends and fellow website owners have been very supportive. I hope they will be again!\n\nREGARDING BACKUP STRATEGIES -- a number of people have asked \"why didn't you have backups?\"\n\nWe did. The database was entirely backed up (if you go to EN World right now, you can see that every post, thread, and user is still present and correct - no data was lost).\n\nThe code, on the other hand, consisted of a heavily modified vBulletin 3.x codebase. It was a decade old, and subject to exploits over the years. In short, a decade after it was installed, it was no longer secure or reliable -- that's why the hackers were able to get in. In short, it was vulnerable, and the backups of the code were therefore also vulnerable. I made the decision, therefore, to upgrade to the modern, supported, and far more secure vBulletin 4.2. The effect of this was that our code was all rendered obsolete/incompatible. I couldn't just use it again; it was for a different version of the core codebase. \n\nHopefully that explains why I couldn't just use the backups. I could have, but if the site had been restored to exactly how it was before the hack, the hackers would have immediately jumped in again the next week using the exact same method.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #44", "update_userinfo": "Latest Silver Lifetime Subscriber Rewards", "update_content": "Hi everyone!

It has been praised for its ambitious and original design, its epic flavor and its lurid, full-color art \u2013 including a cover by the award winning Wayne Reynolds.\nLogue tapped a team of veteran designers to help develop and write Razor Coast, including Lou Agresta, Adam Daigle, Tim Hitchcock, and John Ling. Razor Coast isn\u2019t just an adventure, it\u2019s part setting, part adventure path, and part toolkit to build your own unique campaign. It\u2019s non-linear and will never play the same way twice.\nWe filled it with corrupt municipal Dragoons, dastardly smuggling rings, weresharks \u2013 lots of weresharks - desperate naval battles, oppressed tribes craving heroes, witches, cursed islands, legendary treasure troves, an impending apocalypse or two, demon pirates, retired assassins, undead worms, gator men, failed heroes waiting to be redeemed, dark conspiracies brewing in the oceans depths, vengeful ghosts\u2026oh \u2013 and mutating cannibal pygmies. Who doesn\u2019t like those?\nThe final book will be delivered in 100% full color, tightly bound with our infamous stitched-bound hardcovers -- or secured by genuine leather covers for our serious collector. Our goal is to raise $75,000 for the additional costs to authors, artists, the printing it takes to finish the project, and similar costs -- and lastly, to create the Player's Guide. We have grander plans for Razor Coast and will reveal them with Bonus Goals.\nVisit our website for all the sneak peeks, inside looks, and interviews\nRead More About Fire As She Bears\nFire As She Bears is available in Pathfinder Roleplaying System and Swords & Wizardry. You may add it on to any pledge level for $15 Print & PDF or $7 for PDF Only. (Shipping may apply to $5 pledges or PDF only pledges for print copies.)\nFrog God Games is pleased to announce that we will be adding an adventure to the book written by one of the giants of the industry (as a bonus to all of you who buy the main book or back the project here on Kickstarter).\nMore content!\nFrank Mentzer, long a part of the game industry has offered to help us with Razor Coast. This is particularly inspiring to all of us here in Frog Land, as it merges the old and the new into one great package. Frank is near and dear to us old folks as he was one of the originals that created the game, and thus spawned our Swords & Wizardry line. For all the Pathfinder fans out there, Frank is one of the named developers working with Paizo and Goblinworks as part of their superstar lineup for the Emerald Spire MMO . Frank has been one of the writers to connect the two worlds of OSR work and Pathfinder, and we are glad to have him writing for us!\nFrank Mentzer is an Old School gamer best known for writing five D&D rule sets (Basic, Expert, Companion, Masters, and Immortals) and other D&D products with his friend and co-author Gary Gygax. Frank was at TSR from 1980 to 1986 and is one of the best-selling authors in the history of the industry, with tens of millions of copies of his works published during that era. His other creations include the legendary Temple of Elemental Evil (with Gygax) and the game version of 2001: A Space Odyssey. He won the title of #1 Dungeon Master (1980) and an Origins Award for GameMaster Secrets II (1993). Frank has been a game auctioneeer at the world's largest game auction (at GenCon, the world's largest game convention, of course) for almost 30 years. He responds to Q&A message boards on multiple sites. Frank spent the last two decades in other business but, now that he's 'retired' (over 60), recently started this new publishing company, \"Eldritch Enterprises\", with Tim Kask and Jim Ward (both 'founding fathers' of the game industry in the 1970s) and Chris Clark (of Inner City Games).\nIndulgences\nSecond, we are converting all 8 of the original Razor Coast Indulgence expansions to Pathfinder and Swords and Wizardry.

This Necromancer Games product (eidition 3.5) runs 200 pages and is a treasury of nautical lore. No place offers more adventure than the ocean. No dungeon is as deep, no jungle as full of exotic and dangerous life. Most folk spend their entire lives on dry ground, unaware that entire civilizations thrive beneath the waves, sometimes far more ancient and steeped in mystery than any on the world's upper surface. Though player characters (PCs) have long grown familiar with the air-breathing world above, seldom do they venture into the depths, and when they do, they discover wonders they never dreamed existed. The ocean offers a venue for adventure that is at once alien and appealing. Strange things exist down there, as perilous as they are compelling.\n\nDead Man's Chest lays bare the ocean and the creatures that inhabit it. Within these pages are detailed rules for ship movement, as well as guidelines for underwater exploration, and three complete maritime adventures. This comprehensive source for sailing is sea-packed with over 100 new magic items, monsters, feats, prestige classes, and spells. Plus get a bonus NOW to accompany Dead Man's Chest\u2122.

We already fulfilled our Rappan Athuk Kickstarter, and we will fulfill our latest Kickstarter of Swords & Wizardry in January 2013. \n\nHowever, bonus goals added to this project might delay delivery but we will communicate that. We take very seriously our commitment to fulfill on time.\n\nWe need to note that while we will ship to Italy, we cannot guarantee delivery for packages shipped to Italy.

It will either be Pets, Additional Gods, or Fast Travel & Mounts.  Your votes will determine which of these systems is prioritized for development first!\nSecond, we are now WORKING ON NEW MINIATURES!\nWe will be continuing to add WizKids Pathfinder Battles pre-painted plastic figures to all the Crowdforger Reward Tiers (and any Add-Ons that feature them too!)  Every $100,000 we reach above the funding goal means we add an additional miniature.  The figures that will be included are to be determined.\nThird, the EMERALD SPIRE WILL GET BIGGER!\nAnnouncing Chris Pramas joining the Emerald Spire All-Star Design Team!\nEvery $100,000 in pledges over $1.050 million adds more Emerald Spire content.  Chris will be included in the book when we get to $1,050,000!\nSean K. Reynolds will be the next designer added to the team at $1,150,000.  Also, when Sean is added the Emerald Spire will be 160 pages and we'll be adding an additional Flip-Map to the Multi-Pack!  Let's make that happen, people!\nWe are a team of experienced game designers and videogame developers who have joined forces to make a next-generation fantasy sandbox MMO, called Pathfinder Online.\nThanks to our community of committed enthusiasts we completed our second Kickstarter.  The funding from this project will enable us to substantially accelerate the schedule for Pathfinder Online.\nWe invite you to join the community and the conversation on the Pathfinder Online discussion forums.  \nThis page has been preserved intact from the end of the Kickstarter.  Our thanks to everyone who helped make this success possible!\nINTRODUCING THE PATHFINDER ONLINE KICKSTARTER!\nSince the start of the campaign, we have added extensive Bonus Content to many of the Reward Levels.  To see a summary of the current status of the most popular Rewards, please click this link:\nAfter we announced that UNITY will be our primary middleware platform (and that we'd be making a version for Macintosh!) we released the Environmental Experience so that you can get a taste of how our Technology Demo assets look in the new engine.  To play the Enviroinmental Experience in Firefox, Chrome or Internet Explorer, click this link:\nWE ARE FUNDED!\nAwed, humbled, utterly blown away by your love and support.  Words fail us.\nHaving reached our funding goal is such an amazing achievement.  We'll be the 10th most funded videogame project in Kickstarter history.  We are showing the videogame industry that there's a place for a fantasy sandbox MMO, FUNDED BY ITS PLAYERS.\nThis is history-making stuff here, people.  And you are a part of it.\nThe Last Daily Deal!\nThis is the Daily Deal for today.  Everyone who backed the project from 10:00am today on will receive a copy of this item!\nHere is the complete list of Daily Deals.  If you're curious how to get access to the items you missed, read the \"Adventurer and Crowdforger Reward Bonus - Invite A Friend: Shieldmate\" info under the Kickstarter Reward Level header.\n@Andius on the Pathfinder Forums, complied this awesome list of what makes the game different from other MMOs you may have played in the past. \nPathfinder Online is a fantasy sandbox MMO by Goblinworks based on the Pathfinder tabletop game. It uses a unique process called \"Crowdforging\" to determine what features are implemented in the game, in what order.\nHere is a brief list of some of the highlights of this game: \n1. No Grinding- Pathfinder Online uses a skill training system like that of EVE Online. You train skills by choosing what skill you want to train and allowing the time required to elapse. You don't train any faster by farming mobs or spamming your abilities than you do exploring the world, role playing with your friends, or even being offline. You will need to complete certain achievements to complete a skill and open up new avenues of training.\n2. No Classes- Unlike other games that give you a narrow range of abilities as you train your class, in Pathfinder you gain levels in different Roles based off what you have trained.\n3. Player Structures- Build your own homes, taverns, farms, and even cities! The Pathfinder Online world will be filled with places players can use to build and customize their own homes, businesses and communities.\n4. More Than A Gankfest- Unlike other Open World PVP MMO's currently on the market, Pathfinder Online actively discourages meaningless PVP. A meaningful alignment system that actually offers mechanical advantages to lawful and good aligned organizations, and a functional bounty system that allows the player to choose which players and organizations can collect the bounties they set discourages random and meaningless killing. Beyond this, the admins are taking a hard stance against 'griefing', in which players specifically seek to ruin the experience of other players, often through using game mechanics in ways that weren't intended. Griefing in PFO can be a bannable offence.\n5. All Players are Useful- This won't be like games where a new player has 49 health and a veteran has 49,000. The attacks from that new player won't automatically miss the veteran. A new player will be weaker, but still able to make a meaningful contribution to combat. As a sandbox where group sizes aren't limited, this means all players are useful, and don't have to segregate themselves by level.\n6. Trade is Meaningful- In Pathfinder Online players must manually transport items to their intended destination. Most shops are player-run, and there will be goods more abundant in or even exclusive to certain regions. Merchants, traders, and even auctioneers are all viable professions.\nEvery 2 weeks we publish a Development Blog about Pathfinder Online on the Goblinworks website.  Those blogs contain a wealth of information about the design and the ideas we have for the game.\n@Valkenr on the message boards assembled links to \"the blog posts everyone should read\".\nThe Emerald Spire Superdungeon includes 32 pages of source material detailing the area around Fort Inevitable, one of the starter towns in the Pathfinder Online game.  This book replaces the Fort Indomitable sourcebook listed in the Loremaster reward description. The PDF Superdungeon will be accompanied by the PDF Emerald Spire Dungeons Flip-Mat Multi-Pack, a set of Pathfinder Flip-Mats presenting each dungeon level in tabletop miniatures scale.Emerald Spire Superdungeon Co-Designers\nWe are also pleased to announce that new WizKids Pathfinder Battles Miniatures are being added to the rewards for all Crowdforger Pioneer levels and above!  Crowdforger Buddies will get 2 of each miniature, and Crowdforger Guilds will get 6 of each miniature.\nBecause you can only select one Reward, the Add-On system was evolved by the Kickstarter community as a way to include additional benefits for backing a project.  To use Add-Ons, increase the total amount of your pledge by the specified sum.  Leave your Reward selection unchanged.  In the post-Project Kickstarter Backer Survey process you'll be able to tell us how you want to allocate the Add-On pledge money!\nPlease direct questions about Add-Ons directly to Goblinworks via email.\nChanging your Pledge amount will NOT affect your Daily Deal start date.\nCrowdforger Buddy and Crowdforger Guild Rewards produce 2 and 6 Pathfinder Online Accounts respectively.  You will be able to assign these accounts in the post-campaign survey process and there is no rush.\n\n$10 - Class Pack\nWhen characters arrive in the River Kingdoms in Pathfinder Online, they do so with little wealth or equipment to their name.  A Class Pack will provide the character with a selection of items appropriate to a lower level character\nof the class selected when the class pack is used.  Each pack will include a weapon, a suit of armor (torso, legs, and helmet if applicable), and three or four other items of such as thieves tools, shields, boots, gloves, belts, hats,\netc.  One Class Pack is required per character.  You may purchase this Add-On multiple times.\n$10 - Honorable Title\nPrior to arriving in the River Kingdoms, your character served with distinction elsewhere and was recognized for that service.  You'll be able to choose a formal title for your character of Sir, Dame, Master, Brother, Sister, Father\nor Mother.  You will be able to control when this title is displayed to others in-game.  One Honorable Title is required per character.  You may purchase this Add-On multiple times.\n$10 - Secret Salute\nYou will have access to a special title that commemorates your participation in the Kickstarter.  Titles are selectable in game and you can determine when this title is displayed to other characters.  You will be able to trigger an\non-command \"emote\" animation available only to Kickstarter backers!  A fun way to commemorate the Kickstarter and to show solidarity with other Backers in-game!  All characters on your account will have these\nbenefits.\n$15 - Additional Player Pack\nYou packed with foresight before arriving in the River Kingdoms!  You'll get an extra Player Pack that you can assign to any character you create, or sell on the in-game market to players who didn't plan as well for their journey along the Crusader Road!  One Player Pack is required per character.  You may purchase this Add-On multiple times.\n$15 - Regional Trait Pack\nPlayers can purchase Regional Traits Packs for their characters that give them background elements of coming from a specific country or region in Golarion.  A Region Trait Pack will provide the character with an achievement\nstating the country they hail from, a title, and a small mechanical effect, all based on the country of origin selected when the pack is used.  Select one from: Absalom, Andoran, Cheliax, Five King\u2019s Mountain, Galt, Katapesh,\nKyonin, Lands of the Linnorm Kings, Mwangi Expanse, Osirion, Qadira, Rahadoum, The Shackles, Taldor, Ustalav, and Varisia.  One Regional Trait Pack is required per character.  You may purchase this Add-On multiple times.\n$20 - Additional Alliance Pack\nYour network of contacts is exceptional.  As you arrive in the River Kingdoms you are able to make friends faster than your peers.  You'll get an extra Alliance Pack that you can assign to any character you create, or sell on the\nin-game market to players who didn't make a great first impression. You may purchase this Add-On multiple times.\n(Note that each character can only gain the benefit of one Alliance Pack at a time)\n\n$20 - The Memorial of Honor\nIn the middle of the Crusader Road is a mysterious structure that calls to nearby travelers.  Characters who approach and are recognized elicit a display of eldritch power from the construct.  Activating the structure removes unwanted disabilities that may have been inflicted in battle or by the acts of other characters.  In addition, you may opt to have your real name inscribed on the monument, visible to any who choose to pause for deeper inspection.  You may purchase this Add-On multiple times, once for each Character you wish to honor.\n$20 - Twice-Marked of Pharasma\nAll characters in Pathfinder Online are marked by Pharasma and are thus able to return from the dead at the soulbinding points.  You bear the same mark as all other characters but you have a second, distinctive mark\nas well.  None know why you bear this mark, nor what it may portend in the future, but be sure that Fate has many surprises in store for those who are Twice-Chosen by the Lady of Graves.  The bearer of this second Mark\nwill have access to content and mechanical benefits distinct to those who are Twice Marked!  One Twice-Marked of Pharasma Add-On is required for each character.  You may purchase this Add-On multiple times.\n$30 - Three Months of Game Time\nExtend the subscription time included with your Reward by +3 additional months! (Limit 3 per Pathfinder Online account)\n$35 - Adventurer Reward Tier\nYou can Add-On as many Adventurer Rewards as you wish.  They will not be able to play the game until the Adventurers are invited to join.  They will be eligible for Daily Deals as of the date you increase your pledge by $35 increments, not the date of your first eligibility.\n$50 - Miniature Multiplier\nGet an additional set of all the WizKids Pathfinder Battles prepainted plastic miniatures from the Crowdforger levels!  You may purchase this Add-On multiple times.  Available only to $100 Crowdforger Pioneer Backers (and higher).  There is no shipping charge for this Add-On.\n$100 - 1 Year of Game Time\nExtend the subscription time included with your Reward by +12 additional months!  (Limit 1 per Pathfinder Online account)\n$100 - RPG Print Pack Add-On\nFor Backers who want to get the Emerald Spire Superdungeon and Flip-Mat Multi-Pack in print as well as PDF.  The RPG Print Pack includes a hardcover print edition of the Emerald Spire Superdungeon, featuring an exclusive\ncover available only to Kickstarter backers; a print edition of the Emerald Spire Dungeons Flip-Mat Multi-Pack; a print edition of the Pathfinder Tales novel The Crusader Road; and an Emerald Spire Campaign Cards game\naccessory.  Also includes 2 bonus Reaper metal miniatures!\n\nAdd $15 for shipping to non-US addresses.  Canada and Mexico are not US addresses.\n\nYou may purchase this Add-On multiple times.\n$500 - Hellknights Most Wanted\nYou get all of the physical RPG products in this Kickstarter including the Emerald Spire Superdungeon hardback, the Emerald Spire Dungeon Flip-Mat Multipack, all of the Crowdforger-level Pathfinder Battles miniatures, 2 bonus\nReaper metal minis a print copy of the Pathfinder Tales novel \"The Crusader Road\", and the Emerald Spire Campaign Cards game accessory.  As an added bonus, you will get PDFs of the Emerald Spire Superdungeon, the\nEmerald Spire Dungeons Flip-Mat Multipack, and the Pathfinder Tales novel The Crusader Road.\nIn addition, you will provide Goblinworks with a proper name for a character and a 300-word description of that character for use on a wanted poster from the Hellknights in Fort Inevitable.  You will even be able to tell us what\nyour character is wanted for in the 300-word description.  We will then use Paizo's Pathfinder artists to render a full-color head-shot of that character and then use that head-shot to create a wanted poster of your character. A\nPDF of all the wanted posters created with this reward add-on will be included along with the Emerald Spire Superdungeon PDF, and the wanted fugitives will appear on the random encounter charts for the Echo Wood area around Fort Inevitable and the Emerald Spire. \nTo top it all off, you will have the opportunity to use that head-shot as a unique avatar on the paizo.com messageboards!  \nAdd $15 for shipping to non-US addresses.  Canada and Mexico are not US addresses.\n\nYou may purchase this Add-On multiple times.\nPlease direct questions about Add-Ons directly to Goblinworks via email.\nWe have added numerous updates, upgrades and bonus content to the Reward Tiers.  There is a link at the top of the page to a complete Pledge Guide showing all these changes.  The following describe some of these updates in more detail.\nAdventurer Reward Bonus - Character Name Reservation:\nYou'll be able to reserve the name of your first Pathfinder Online character!  As as part of the post-Kickstarter survey process you'll be able to give us your first, second and third choices for your first character name.  They'll be assigned in the order you first backed the project at the $35 Adventurer level or higher.  (If all three of your choices are taken by earlier backers, we'll contact you to arrange for more options!)  We reserve the right to limit the use of certain names for legal, marketing and community management reasons.\n\nAdventurer Reward Bonus - The Pathfinder Tabletop RPG Experience:\nYou'll receive a PDF of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook, and the Guide to the River Kingdoms sourcebook.  Together these two books are a $23.98 value.  The heart and soul of the Pathfinder Online game comes from its tabletop roots, and we're pleased to be able to bring you this benefit thanks to our friends at Paizo Publishing!  We also encourage you to join the Pathfinder Society and find a regular gaming group in your area so you can start adventuring in the world of Golarion TODAY!\n\nAdventurer Reward Bonus - Destiny's Twin:\nAs a special feature of Adventurer accounts, you'll be able to have two characters training skills at the same time!  While one character is learning how to master the martial arts and gain renown as a warrior, your other character can be learning the intricacies of the crafting system and earning a name as an industrial powerhouse!  As long as your primary character is earning skill points, so will its counterpart - FOREVER!  The value of this benefit could easily reach hundreds of dollars if you became a long-term player of Pathfinder Online. (You will not be able to log in and play both of these characters at the same time)\nAdventurer Reward Bonus - Head Start:\nYou will be invited to the last month of Early Enrollment so you'll get a jump start on all players joining on Release.  This benefit will be added to the $35 Adventurer Reward Tier.\n\nAdventurer and Crowdforger Reward Bonus - Invite A Friend: Shieldmate\nInvite a friend to the Kickstarter, get a synergy bonus!  After the Kickstarter ends you'll be able to either invite or accept a Friendship link with another Pathfinder Online account.  Once an invitation is accepted, both accounts will unlock a special bonus:  All characters on both accounts will have the Shieldmate Mark.  Any time two or more characters with the Shieldmate Mark are in a group (regardless of if the account holders are Friends or not), all the characters with the Shieldmate Mark in that group will get a synergy bonus.\n\n(Buddy and Guild Rewards provide 2 and 6 Pathfinder Online accounts, respectively.  You can allocate these accounts as you see fit and there will be plenty of time to allocate them - there is no rush.  Buddy and Guild accounts are not automatically Friends, and you can opt to friend other players instead of the other Buddy or Guild accounts in your Reward.)\nYou can only offer or accept one Friendship invite, so you cannot round-robin the Friendship links.  A-B-C-A is not OK.  Only A-B.\n\nIn addition, the two Friends will get access to the Daily Deals as of the earliest pledge date of the two backers.  This is a way for you to enable a Friend to get Daily Deals back to the date of your first eligibility!\nCrowdforger Reward Bonus - $1 Million Early Enrollment Upgrade\nWe've heard a lot of concern from people who want to switch reward levels, but don't want to lose their place in line. We want to make sure everyone has a chance to get into the best reward level for them. We looked at the numbers pretty carefully, and we believe it will only stretch our enrollment slots by about 1000 people to offer this benefit to the Crowdforger pledges up to $1 million.\nWe're going to allow all Crowdforger pledges received before the $1 million milestone into the first month of Early Access. So go ahead and switch levels around however you wish over the next day or so, and don't worry about losing your place in line. Once we hit $1 million, the normal system will be back in effect.\n\nCrowdforger Reward Bonus - Reaper MIniatures\nOur friends at Reaper have provided us with a great addition to the Crowdforger Rewards!  Baron Tervin Blackshield, ruler of Thornkeep, and goblin commander of the Accursed Halls, Murgmo, come from the pages of the Pathfinder Online: Thornkeep book.  These unpainted metal miniatures will be included free for all Crowdforger Rewards AND to the RPG Print Pack Add-On and the Hellknights Most Wanted Add-On!  We've already got a sneak peek at Murgmo!\nPDF Superpack Available to ALL CROWDFORGER LEVELS!\nPaizo's community is very strong, and that includes friends at many excellent third-party publishers that make roleplaying products for use with the Pathfinder RPG. Paizo reached out to those publishers and asked them if they would be willing to donate a PDF or two (or sometimes even more) that we could bundle up and offer as part of the Crowdforger Kickstarter backers, and the response has been absolutely amazing\u2014including Paizo's own contribution, it currently includes 59  products from 37 different publishers, with a total retail value of $318.50!

One of the largest costs for a computer game project of this scope is the costs for people. If there are significant delays that prevent us from releasing the game to paying customers on time, we would need an influx of capital to make it to the later release. If we couldn\u2019t get that capital, then the release of the game could be in jeopardy. Also, if we were to lose a key member of our staff, it could impact our ability to produce the game. Thankfully, we have contracts in place for all of our key staff, so it would take an extraordinary situation for us to lose one of them. \n\nThe key Goblinworks staff has started and grown many successful companies. They have seen MMO games through to completion. In any project of this scope, there will be unseen challenges that will spring up, but the depth of experience of our staff makes us confident that we will be able to meet those challenges head on and defeat them.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #115", "update_userinfo": "Opening Up the Echo Woods", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #114", "update_userinfo": "Kingmaker: Rule Your World!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #113", "update_userinfo": "The Nhur Athemon Sequence", "update_content": "From deep within the Emerald Spire, the Azlanti lich Nhur Athemon spent centuries setting his plans in motion, intricate schemes that played out in the world above over hundreds of mortal lifetimes.

As those heroes have tamed the lands and established new settlements to help them grow in power, they've thwarted Nhur Athemon's plans time and again. To deal with these nuisances once and for all, he's triggered a series of events repeated throughout the Echo Woods, a sequence of escalating invasions designed to crush each new settlement in turn. Familiar creatures, increasing in strength and power, have started appearing in all the most dangerous places across the map, but what new monstrous threat awaits when these attacks reach their peak?

Worth it? Hell yeah! But it made me think that it's time for this part of the Midwest to get a properly massive geek-con of our very own. And the DECC is just the place!\nLook at all the gaming we could fit in this thing!\nThe more support we get and the more quickly we get it; the more incredible Berserkon will be! If we start hitting stretch goals, it'll mean more events, more guests, and possibly even more time.\n\nPeople on our team have cut their teeth organizing and running a smaller local convention at the University of Wisconsin-Superior known as SoupCon. It's a project they've been involved with for a few years now, and even though it's a one day thing, it's really popular.\n\nOur liaison to the DECC is very involved and terrific at her job. We're honestly blown away at how supportive and helpful she's been with making sure we have exactly what we need when we need it, and offering useful feedback and advice.\n\nThere are also game-store owners who have experience running big events on a regular basis. For my part, I'm the one who knows people, and is willing to get in front of the camera and make a boob out of myself. So I guess that means I'm the PR guy and organizer!\n\nI've also been in contact with my ZOE pals who just put on their first convention this year. This is the biggest event most of us (apart from April of the DECC) have been involved with, but these are smart and dedicated people that I have absolute confidence in!\nOur location is prime for residents of the US, as well as being just a day's travel away from Winnipeg and Thunder Bay.\nPotential sponsors (who might also become backers) will be keeping an eye on this Kickstarter to see how many people will come to this neck of the woods for a bigger piece of the gaming scene!\nWe've been talking to Paizo, Fantasy Flight, high level M:tG judges, Privateer Press, AEG, and several others.\nThere will be RPGs, high-profile TCG tournaments, wargaming, a LAN room, board games (CATAN!), costume contests, and all kinds of celebrity guests!

What's not to love?\nAs it turns out, they're also really expensive to produce.  The mold costs alone are astronomical.  In order to grow this line, we can do it slow and steady over the next several years, or we can defer to you guys and launch a bunch of new ones as soon as possible.\nBy the end of the year, we anticipate having 30 products in the Bones line. What this Kickstarter will do is at least double the Bones line to 60 total models: character models, new sculpts, big monsters, the sky's pretty much the limit.\nAll we need to kickstart this thing is your support.\nWhat Do I Get For Supporting You?\nWe have a number of opportunities available for our supporters.  \nThese include, but are not limited to, various apparel items, a chance to receive each of the new 30 plastic models, a metal Kickstarter-exclusive Sophie model, Design-Your-Own-Miniature packages, not to mention some of the most valuable Crown Jewel one-of-a-kind items from the Reaper archives.
