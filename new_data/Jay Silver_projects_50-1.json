I am a commercial fisherman by trade and love a great steak. However, sometimes the weather can be against us and we cannot afford the better cuts of meat. So we figured a way to make this cheaper and tougher cut of meat tender and juicy. So during this we always would cut these juicy steaks and make a mess because all the juices would flow off the the cutting board and all over the counter. One day while commercial fishing I had this idea of making a board that would save the juices in a trough so that you could spoon them out over your sliced meat. I then realized that many people have tried to design a complex solution. Could the answer be so simple. We spend thousands of dollars on grills and cooking devices to make meals \"juicey\"we spend hours prepping and marinading our food just so that when we carve into them the juices end up all over the counter.

Our backers wowed us with so many creative applications of the Circuit Scribe pen, and these were the inspiration for our new DIY kits.  Welcome to the world of DIY paper electronics!\nWhat's Circuit Scribe?\nCircuit Scribe is the original conductive ink rollerball pen. With a non-toxic, highly conductive, silver and water based ink, you can draw your own circuits by hand. Our customers have used the pen for education, prototyping, and electronic art. The educational kits come with magnetic component modules that snap onto the circuit, allowing you to create fun electronic paper crafts using a range of basic to advanced circuit concepts.\nApply What You Learned\nThe new DIY kits are a continuation of our mission to make learning about electricity fun and engaging, but you don't need the educational kits to create with the DIY kits! \nOur original kits emphasized education by teaching basic circuitry principles, while our new kits emphasize application by allowing you to apply those concepts to DIY projects, using the classic Circuit Scribe pen to draw the connections.  The chart below shows how these fundamental concepts are applied to tangible projects that are useful (or just fun!) in your daily life. \nThe Drone Kit\nThis kit really flies off the page! Create a 4-propeller drone using cardboard and the Circuit Scribe conductive ink pen. The DIY Drone packaging will have perforated sections you can punch for perfectly proportioned structure, then draw the electrical connections, add the 4 propeller clamps and the motor to the body and you've made a remote control drone. This kit can be reconfigured to change the drone's size or even turn it into a flying paper airplane.\nIf you're already a fan of drones or quadcopters, try your hand at creating one out of paper!\nThe Calculator Kit\nWe partnered with Dr. Saar Drimer of Boldport for the artful design of the DIY Calculator kit. This kit lets you design your own calculator key pad on paper. In addition to a calculator module & Circuit Scribe pen, the kit includes an easy to read guidebook that teaches you about touch sensors. Follow our outline when creating your calculator or get wild & crazy by drawing your own unique touch pads. \nOur original calculator prototype\nWe want our community to have endless opportunities to be creative with the kit so we're working on a new V2 prototype that will be solar powered (no pesky batteries or wires!) and have a unique paper-clip design that will allow you to move from notebook to planner to desktop!\nOur new design is a unique clip-on board\nThe LiteWing Kit\nNow your Circuit Scribe creations can move using the maple seed as inspiration. Your version of this \"helicopter seed\" spins to the ground with an LED on its wing and a coin cell battery on the weighted base. Simply connect the battery to the LED with your included Circuit Scribe pen and toss in the air. \nThis kit is perfect for anyone who knows their circuit basics!\nKit Contents\nAll of our kits will come with everything you need in the box! A Circuit Scribe pen to complete the circuits, the appropriate modules & supplies, plus an instructional guidebook to ensure the project will come to life.\nCustomize and Share your work\nBecause your DIY creations are made out of conductive ink and paper, they are easy to customize. Get artsy with colored pencils and pens, or add your own paper engineering elements with custom folds.  You'll be able to find detailed instructions and visual aides for our brand new kits on sketch.circuitscribe.com.  Our platform also lets you upload your work and inspire other makers.\nWhy We Need Kickstarter\nThese brand new kits are a departure from our original color-coded magnetic modules, using a few new innovative ways to attach components to paper.  While it's exciting to introduce some new methods for attaching components to paper, we need to open brand new product tooling and create new protocols for assembly. That's why we're coming full circle and asking you, the Kickstarter community, to help make this possible!\nDrone: has a flex board based hub, plus new app for flying\nCalculator: uses a patent-pending thin PCB clip-on design\nLiteWing: components are pre-attached to the paper, and precisely weighted for peak aerodynamic action \nWe also want your input to help us figure out what the final designs will look like.  All of the products that you see in our campaign are functional prototypes; we'll keep everyone up to date on our design evolution and take your feedback into account.\nBacker Rewards\nWe have some great rewards for our backers!  All funding levels come with everything you need right out of the box, including instructions.  See the sidebar for details!  Our highest backing level - $1500 - comes with our maker space oriented kit, represented below.  You'll get all of our available products in one handy carrying case, plus you'll have access to some of our newest offerings such as resistor pens!\nMeet Circuit Scribe\nIt all started with an idea, some conductive ink research, and the help of over 12,000 backers on Kickstarter! \nWe now have a close-knit team of 5 working on the Circuit Scribe kits.  We bring together expertise in engineering, STEM education, marketing, and product manufacturing to give you the best products possible.  We're also obsessed with tinkering and having fun with electronics!  \nCustomer Feedback\nSince 2014, we have received some incredible feedback from our community!  We're happy to have contributed to helping kids and adults, alike, learn about the circuits that run our modern world.\n| \"They are so much fun and bring electronics concepts into a playful learning experience.\"  -Amazon review\n| \"My son is 8 years old and likes this pack so much...After a few days, his workbook was full of creative ideas.\"  -Amazon review\nNot only have our customers shown support, they have made some pretty creative projects that inspired us to design our new line of DIY kits.  Check out some of their social media posts below, and join in the fun using #circuitscribe.\n Shout Outs!\nSpecial shout out to some of the makers featured in the campaign, thank you!\nlinneakirby.com\n@mrbombmusic\n@kfaisteele\n@workbenchplat", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Thank You!", "descp": "Stay up to date with our progress!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2017"}], "stat": ["33 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 8 or more", "title": "DIY LiteWing Kit", "descp": "An intro kit for all ages to circuits and aerodynamics!

It was first made by mixing RP-1 rocket fuel (similar to kerosene) with magnetite particles so that magnetic forces could pull the fuel into the rocket engines in zero gravity. \nIt's a very unique substance that has only recently been available for use outside of industrial applications. I sought to utilize these unique properties of ferrofluid and bring them to life visually in the RIZE.\nThe RIZE is activated when you place the sculpture onto its magnetic base.\nThis magnetizes the giant machined screw in the middle and causes the ferrofluid to spin around and rise up in a beautiful display that will keep you mesmerized.\nThe RIZE captivates childlike curiosity and amazement when people view it, and it makes for the ultimate distraction on your desk or centerpiece in your office.\nEven after interacting with these displays for years they still give me inspiration when I see them in action.\nThe sculpture itself is also a feast for the eyes, created with a variety of different metals and finishes:\nEvery square inch of the RIZE is hand crafted and museum worthy.\nIt's also 100% made in the US, right here in our studio in Opelika, Alabama. We are also shipping anywhere in the US for FREE!\nThis project has taken years of research to perfect, and now we even have colored ferrofluid available.\n    4 metallic color-shifting pigments are available:\nGold\n  Red-Orange Color Shift\n  Blue-Purple Color Shift\n  Purple-Pink Color Shift\n   Each RIZE also includes a powerful handheld N52 neodymium magnet.\n The handheld magnet also seperates into 2 smaller magnets for more interaction:\nPLAY\n\nMy Background and Inspiration\nHey I'm Matt, and I've been working with ferrofluid full time for the last 3 years. I have a degree in Electrical Engineering and have always enjoyed creating art. After surviving a plane crash I decided that life was too short to waste in a cubicle and that I would pursue my dream of inventing cool products full time.

You gain valuable feedback from the backer community and can also offer the product at a highly discounted price before launch (because you can cut out retail middlemen and pass those margins on as savings). We had a great experience launching our last project on Kickstarter (the Ferroflow) and look forward to another successful completion!\nAnother good thing about Kickstarter is that your credit card won't even be charged until the funding period is completed (9/18).\nDelivery Schedule:\nSeptember/October - finish Kickstarter campaign, order parts\nNovember/December - receive parts and begin assembly\nJanuary - begin sending out RIZE sculptures\nIt's going to be close but our goal is to ship out the early backer rewards before Christmas!!!   We will be shipping out the finished RIZE sculptures every day as soon as we complete them, so the others won't be far behind.\nThanks for your support! \n    Would you like to feature the RIZE in a story?

Working with readily available water test kits, the CitizenSpring app uses computer vision to read the test results and then uploads the results to a map so everybody can see where it's safe to drink.\nUse CitizenSpring to identify safe drinking water for you and your family. Easily test any water source in your community and share the results for all to see.\nLead contamination can be focused in a single building or even a single faucet, but can also cover an entire street or city supply main. And if one of the faucets you drink from tests positive for lead, you simply need more data to know whether you should call a plumber, your building management, your local government, or the EPA.\nPLAY\n\nCitizenSpring aims to be part of the solution by recording not just test results, but also details such as time, date, and location, effectively turning citizens into scientists.\n  Lead is toxic [1], particularly in children where it can cause reduced IQ, ADHD, symptoms of autism, and memory disruption, among many other problems. And recently lead has been showing up in our drinking water all across the country [2], including schools and daycares [3], and officials have been found systematically delaying and even falsifying public testing records [4]. \n[1] http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-mark-hyman/lead-poisoning-why-lead-p_b_609383.html\n[2] http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/03/11/nearly-2000-water-systems-fail-lead-tests/81220466/ \n[3] http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2016/03/17/drinking-water-lead-schools-day-cares/81220916/\n[4] http://gothamist.com/2016/06/25/city_found_to_have_falsified_water.php\n    Why can\u2019t we just test water at the source?\nThe issue is that even if an initial source of water is pure, lead can seep into water from the corrosion of old pipes, be it on a whole street or a single faucet. The only way to determine whether water is contaminated is to test each faucet directly, but there are over one billion faucets in the country and local municipalities just don\u2019t have the resources to test every single one.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re creating CitizenSpring and why we need your support! Whether it's at home, the office, at school, or at the park, we want to empower individual citizens to test their own water and share the data on a map.  \nSo that together we can identify where it\u2019s safe to drink, hold our public officials accountable and help set priorities to update our aging infrastructure.\nCitizenSpring is more than an app, it\u2019s about creating a movement. Our aim is to give people like you a tool to create change in your own life and in lives of your community. We want to empower people with information to make water quality testing more transparent instead of being centrally organized and largely opaque.\nWhen you use CitizenSpring to test the water in your school or home or any other faucet in your community, and you put the data on a map, you become a Citizen Scientist. You become a part of the solution to identify the patterns of contamination in your community. Right now, local governments and federal agencies just don\u2019t have the resources to test every single faucet. \nAnd that\u2019s where you come in!\nLet\u2019s cut through the red tape and blame and take matters into our own hands to create a grassroots movement and help put every water faucet on the map.\n  My name is Sean Montgomery and I run a technology company called Connected Future Labs. CitizenSpring is my personal mission to leverage the expertise at Connected Future Labs and help make the world a better place by identifying safe sources of drinking water.\nAs a neuroscientist, I\u2019m acutely aware of how toxic lead is to the body, particularly the developing brain. And I think with a little 21st century ingenuity this is a problem, that together, we can solve. Because our team at Connected Future Labs has a wealth of experience creating apps that capture data in the cloud and using computer vision to solve problems ranging from 3D body imaging to recognition of facial expressions to the augmented reality applications, we know that the technology needed for CitizenSpring is well within our grasp and all we need is your support to make it a reality.\nAt CitizenSpring, we are a small and dedicated team that believes in the power of technology to connect people and to make a true difference in lives of individuals as well as many.\nThis is a problem that we can solve!\nAnd we need your support!\nWe have a working prototype iOS app that can read lead test strips and display strip information on a map.\nWe need your support to make the following a reality:\nCreate a full ios app and backend database to guide you through the process of testing your water \nRefine and cross-validate computer vision algorithms\nData upload to the cloud + cloud infrastructure maintenance\nData parsing and loading onto a map \nHelp you take the next steps if unsafe lead levels are detected\nWhile each piece of the technology puzzle is squarely within the Connected Future Labs capabilities, every piece requires careful design and engineering to create a lasting impact.\n          Waterbottle mock up (actual bottle may vary)\n         ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAt Connected Future Labs we have a depth of experience developing apps and data sharing infrastructures.

By taking advantage of the limits of human visual perception, this optical illusion sculpture appears to be doing the impossible \u2014 right before your eyes. Slow Dance combines technology, science, and art, in order to remind us of the natural mystery, beauty, and wonder that surround us every day.\nWatch the following video to learn about how this project went from wedding gift to manufactured sculpture, why this work is important to me and how I got involved with it.\nA TESTAMENT TO BEAUTY\nIt\u2019s like nothing you\u2019ve ever seen in real life. It looks like a picture frame, except that there\u2019s no picture and no glass \u2014 instead, two clips hold objects inside the frame. Plug in Slow Dance and see the magic for yourself.\nReactions to seeing Slow Dance for the first time.\nThe sculpture quiets the mind with an unexpected beauty that appears right in front of us, lowering our stress, and helping our attention become completely present. As far as we've found, it is the easiest way to meditate. It literally reminds us to slow down.\nAN ONGOING EXPERIMENT IN WONDER\nPlay and experiment! YOU bring the objects to Slow Dance \u2014 it is a blank canvas for you to compose. From weeds on the street to flowers in the garden to bird feathers, each object will reveal a new slow motion world. After two years of playing with it ourselves, we are still enchanted when we try out a new object \u2014 the world it reveals seems to be never-ending. It will change how you will see plants and other objects forever.\nDifferent modes allow you to cycle through different dance patterns, some slow and smooth, and others that make the object appear to jump through space!\nMode: Slow Dance - in this mode the object appears to move in slow motion.\nMode: Double Trouble - in this mode it looks like the object starts as one, and splits into two parts before reforming!\nMode: Pop and Lock - in this mode the object looks like it jumps through space, the way that slow motion movies in the 30s did!\nDESIGN\n\"Slow Dance\u201d is made from a 2\u201d pine wood frame. The pine shows the elegance and beauty of the wood grain, while being exceptionally sturdy. Two springs hold objects in the frame, lit from recessed LED lighting.\nSlow Dance comes with two optional feet for added stability.\nThe frame comes with an optional hook for wall mounting, like a picture frame.\nRubber bands allow you to easily change out the 2 provided feathers with any object you might find including other feathers, plants, and your own custom creations.\nA brass faceplate on the bottom of the frame holds the brightness knob, mode button and power plug.\n\nHOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?\nStrobe lights are nothing new. From the photos of Edwaerd Muybridge to the photos of Doc Edgerton, extremely fast strobe lights have been helping us to see into fast motions. On a dancefloor, strobe lights turn us into stop motion animations. But we\u2019ve put strobe light to use in a different fashion.\nBy using high speed strobe lights blinking 80 times a second, your eyes cannot even see that they are blinking \u2014 the light looks continuous. By synchronizing the strobes to the high-speed vibration of objects (feathers, branches, flowers, etc), we create the visual illusion of those objects moving in slow motion. This is a phenomenon called persistence of vision, and works similarly to the way a TV works \u2014 by flickering frozen images quickly enough that we perceive them as continuous motion.\nFor more information check out this Mr. Wizard video about persistence of vision!\nBy varying the timing of the strobe lights, it's possible to make the objects look like they move in impossible ways \u2014 moving in slow motion, jumping discretely to new positions instantaneously, and more. The objects can even be touched, and appear to be moving in slow motion despite the user\u2019s interaction.\n\nSLOW DANCE LIMITED EDITION\nWe are also offering a premium limited edition of 10 Slow Dance sculptures, hand-fabricated from walnut. Each unit is numbered and signed. Get your limited edition piece fabricated by craftsman Forrest Stone.\nLimited edition of 10 in walnut.\n\nPRODUCTION\nOver a year ago we built the first version for our friends Eric and Emily, as a wedding gift. It\u2019s still running in their house (so we have hundreds of hours of working prototypes to trust). From people\u2019s excitement, we saw that others would like to enjoy their own 'Slow Dance.' Shortly after, we built several additional prototypes for manufacturing. \n\nWe have been working for over 9 months with our manufacturing firm, who has manufactured multiple previous successful Kickstarter campaigns, including the original Makey Makey. They have received two of our prototypes and have already sent us prototypes designed for large-scale manufacturing.\nJan 2015: First prototype/gift made\nMar 2015: First discussions with manufacturers\nOct 2015: First prototypes sent to China\nMarch 2016: Receipt of manufacturable prototypes from China, testing, iteration\nAug 2016: Kickstarter campaign \nSept/Oct 2016: Tooling and design of final production version, and finalize packaging. \nNov/Dec 2016: Creation of first production run, assembly, and manufacturing. \nFeb 2017: Shipping, fulfillment, product delivery to backers.\n\nPROTOTYPING\nThis project has been developed over the last two years; below see some images of development. We've been through the process of going from initial prototypes to final object during our dayjob as artists, so this was straightforward - fabricating custom electronics boards and designing our parts for injection molding, to figuring out what parts can be sourced and manufactured in the thousands.\n\nVarious prototyping sketches and mechanics.\nTECH SPECS\nDimensions: 12.5\" x 14.5\" x 2\" (W x H x D)\nWeight: 3 lbs.\nColor Temperature: Warm White \nPower: 12 Volts with US/EU Plug (Global Voltage Compatible 100 - 240V)\nPower use: 2-4W (depending on brightness)\nUsage: Indoor (the darker the better it works)\nLoudness: Virtually silent depending on the object used (more in FAQ).\nIncludes: \n Slow Dance crafted pine frame with two starter feathers \n Two stabilizer feet \n Wall mounting hook + screw \n Extra rubber bands for object mounting\nWe also want to mention that this project will be open source. When we finalize production, the firmware for the Atmel microcontrollers will be made available to all. For the techies out there, the circuit is Arduino compatible so it is easy to re-code Slow Dance to dance in any way you can imagine!\n\nTHE SLOW DANCERS\nThe Slow Dance team brings together backgrounds from MIT to the forests of Maine, from robotics and graphic design to meditation, music, and painting.\nOur Team: Jeff, Danjo, Nick, Hannah, and Muffin\nJeff Lieberman explores the connections between the arts, sciences, education, creativity, and consciousness. He hosted 'Time Warp' on the Discovery Channel, using technology to see beyond the limits of our normal human perception. He shows technological sculptures around the world, to bring people an emotional and mystical connection with science and the universe.

My hope is that Today brings the limitless potential you feel up there, down here.\nWhat inspires me.\nThe spectrum of time\nToday is the spiritual follow-up to my first Kickstarter project, ThePresent, the 365-day clock that reframes your perception of the year.\nMy first Kickstarter project, ThePresent\nThe creative adventure of producing, distributing, and giving talks about ThePresent gradually opened my mind to seeing time as a spectrum.\nThink of it this way: on one end of the \u201cspectrum of time\u201d you have the standard clock that reveals every second of every minute of every hour at a glance.\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, we find ThePresent.\nAs a balancing corrective between these two points on the \"spectrum of time\" is Today, a timepiece that reveals the entire day at a glance.\nYour day at a glance.\nLet's start Today\nI've brought three different styles of prototypes to 90% and I need your support and input to finalize the finishing touches and push this project to completion.\nPictured below are the final prototypes of Today, available in 3 different constructions. \nTODAY - 5\" Desk Clock - Bamboo - $88\nTODAY - 5\" Desk Clock - Bamboo\nTODAY - 11\" Wall Clock  -  Bamboo - $118\nTODAY - 11\" Wall Clock - Bamboo (showing 3pm)\nTODAY - 11\"  Steel and Glass Wall Clock - $158 \nTODAY - 11\" Steel and Glass Wall Clock\nWe are also offering ThePresent, my first Kickstarter project, as a reward bundle option.\nThe bottom 4 rewards to your right contain ThePresent as a bundle option.\nOwn the Present (you really can, as a reward bundle).\nToday specs\nDiameter \nBamboo Desk Clock: 5\" in diameter and 1.5\" deep.\nBamboo Wall Clock: 11\" and 1.5\" deep. \nSteel and Glass Wall Clock: 11\u201d in diameter and 2.25\u201d deep. \nThe edge of the bamboo clock is beautifully finished and meets the edge of the clock face precisely\nWeight: \nBamboo Desk Clock: 1.0 lbs.\nBamboo Wall Clock: 1.4 lbs.\nSteel and Glass Wall Clock: 2.0 lbs.\nBattery life\nRequires two AA batteries. \nDesigned to run for a minimum of 3 years.\nToday takes regular AA batteries and will last at least 3 years until you need to change them\nI've stress tested the supply chain for Today with the same local team of highly skilled craftsmen and women locally in Brooklyn, USA that I worked with to produce thousands of editions of ThePresent.\n\nFrom a plane.\n\nMaking time\nYour pledge will fund the final stages of production:\n\nProduction of all Steel and Glass and Bamboo Clocks in the USA\nTransporting all components to and from vendors to final assembly\nTooling costs for smaller hand to be used in the Desk Clock\nTooling costs for branding \"Today\" into steel battery backplate\nPerfecting the highest quality print to last for decades\nPost Kickstarter e-commerce site design and build\nEngineering and assembly of the movement itself\nQuality control, fulfillment, handling and shipping\nTime and small staff to help bring Today to life\nPackaging design, prototyping, and execution\nAssembly of the clocks and quality control\nKickstarter and Stripe processing fees\nMOQ for the custom domed glass cover\nContingency\nMy Kickstarter goal is modest. The pricing is structured so that if we hit and go over the goal, we are equipped to deliver the clocks by December 2016. After running two successful campaigns, I am confident that your clocks will be delivered on time and on budget. \n\nThe Today fam.\n\nBacking this project will give you a front row seat to the finishing touches and full scale production of Today. I love making videos, and I'm excited to document and share the process with you. \n  Why make Today?\nToday is primarily inspired by living with ThePresent. After raising the initial funding with the help of 837 backers with the first Kickstarter, I've produced and distributed over 3,000 editions of ThePresent. Owners in 48 countries now live with ThePresent.   \n\n\nSideview of ThePresent with Bamboo construction.\nI never imagined myself as someone who introduces new scales of time, but I can't imagine being involved in anything more urgent, meaningful, and rewarding. The way we measure time dictates our behavior and so we deserve access to scales that are more appropriate for the way we live our lives now and far into the future.\n\nI see a world that is less anxious and more grateful about time. A world where time is not an enemy, or money, or something we find new ways to kill. I feel a pull to use technology to positively impact our collective quality of life. \n\nThat view.\n\nThe meditative simplicity of dawn, noon, dusk and midnight was the only way we related to time for tens of thousands of years before modern clocks were popularized during the industrial revolution.\n\nWe are well into the information revolution and yet we have not updated the way we measure time.\n \nNearly everything has changed, except how we measure time. \n\nWe have the chance to change that together, Today.\n\n  What people are saying about ThePresent\n\"It's a beautiful clock that I am proud to have on my wall.\"\n\n\"It helps me find some grounding, or a moment of reflection, a good thought, a deep breath...\"\n\"A subtle reminder to be present throughout the day.\"\n\u201cThis is seriously one of my favorite things. Besides the iPhone, I don't think I've ever been impacted this hard by anything I've ever owned...it's art.\u201d\n\"It is a gentle reminder to breathe.\"\n\"ThePresent removed the borders, the constraints. It's a ballerina's pirouette, a swan's glide, a wind with no beginning or end.\"\n\"It grounds me and shows me where I am in time.\"\nTalking about time.\nWhat the press is saying about ThePresent\n\"It\u2019s all about encouraging us to experience time as a natural, contiguous slipstream, instead of something to stress out about having too little (or too much) of in arbitrary chunks.\" \u2013\u2013 Fast Company\n\n\"Anti-Anxiety Object, ThePresent is a very special clock.\" \u2013\u2013  ArtInfo\n\n\"One of the most Zen clocks we've seen.\" \u2013\u2013 Coolhunting\n\n\"Have you ever felt like time is moving too fast?

In the same year, Thrift was recognized by Good Magazine as one of the GOOD100, an annual list of people on the cutting edge of creative impact. Thrift has spent the past few years building clocks and giving talks on the subjects of time and media at TED@NYC, TEDxStPeterPort, Applied Brilliance, PSFK. \n\nBack to 1st person...On a personal note, I feel like I am in the right place at the right time most of the time. My work with ThePresent and now Today is the most profound and exciting thing I can imagine doing with my time.\nRux Design: RUX is a NYC-based design studio specializing in product innovation, design, and brand creation.

We wanted to create something that inspired both boys and girls. \nThere\u2019s not enough making and coding together: Over the last 3 years of making with thousands of kids and parents, we have learned that when you introduce coding alongside crafting and making, it boosts confidence and enthusiasm, leaving kids wanting to learn more.\nPeople Will Save Us!\nWe launched Tech Will Save Us after we worked for many years in education and design realized it wasn\u2019t moving fast enough for the pace of tech.

Please read our final update or visit Modkit.io to learn more.\nModkit.io is an Event Oriented Multithreaded Programming Language\nModkit.io is a new kind of programming language for the Internet of Everything for Everyone. It has a rich, yet surprisingly intuitive, multithreaded and event oriented syntax that will be familiar to millions of young students and educators who have been exposed to Scratch. And it works with Wiring, the microcontroller framework used in the Arduino IDE as well as development tools from TI, Particle, and Intel.  \nMultithreading is traditionally thought of and introduced as an advanced programming concept, but it just means you can have multiple things going on at the same time. Event-oriented simply means things can alert other things when something interesting happens. Unlike most programming languages, both of these concepts are built-in to Modkit.io, not introduced as a complicated afterthought.\nSupported Editors and Hardware\nModkit.io works with the most popular programming environments\nModkit.io works with the most popular microcontroller development environments including the Arduino IDE, Particle Build, TI Energia, and Wiring.  If your hardware is supported by one of these environments chances are you can use Modkit.io to program it and make use of all of your existing libraries! The boards in the image below have already been tested.\nModkit.io supports the most popular development boards\nBut we could never test the 100's of possible boards ourselves. Be one of our first 1000 $1 backers by June 1, and help us test Modkit.io for your favorite development hardware.\nHelp us test Modkit.io with even more boards by pledging just $1\nPre-campaign\nImportant: We will add additional rewards once we reach our goal of 1000 pre-campaign supporters. But if we fail to reach our pre-campaign goal by June 1, our campaign will be cancelled due to insignificant demand.\nUnlike most Kickstarter campaigns that start giving out rewards months (sometimes years) after funding success and add additional \"stretch-goals\" once they reach their initial fundraising goal, like most everything else at Modkit, we thought we'd do things a bit differently. So instead of a stretch-goal we set a pre-goal that's actually not about money at all. Our goal is to get our new programming language Modkit.io out to 1000 backers before we even start our campaign!\nOur official campaign starts on June 1, but to connect with our earliest adopters and potential partners, get important feedback, and gather stories about how you will use Modkit.io, we're offering 1000 backers a single download of our Modkit.io library for Wiring-based microcontrollers for the absolute minimum Kickstarter pledge of $1. If we don't reach our pre-goal by June 1, we plan to cancel our campaign and if we don't reach our final goal by June 30, none of our backers will be charged. So if we're not successful you will actually get your pre-reward for free!\nWhat do we mean by Internet?\nThe Internet starts with local networks\nWhen people think about the Internet they often think about being able to communicate with anyone and everyone, anywhere in the world. But the Internet is simply a network of networks and it all starts with local networks. The same Internet protocols that allow you to communicate with a website or service across the world, allow you to send a document to a printer or to stream content to a television across the room. These same protocols can even be used to communicate between different programs on a single computer or device. This makes the Internet both technologically and socially democratic.\nWhat do we mean by Everything?\nThe Internet of Everything starts with Things\nJust like the Internet starts locally, we believe that the Internet of Everything should begin with a single thing and scale up from there. When developing programming languages to talk to things across the world, it is interesting to think that the same languages people use to talk to each other are the very languages we use to formulate thoughts, make personal plans, and ultimately to talk to oneself. \nWe've seen many tools and languages proposed for the Internet of Things that do not provide a way for things to talk to themselves and to other things across the room in the same way that they talk to other things or computers across the world. Modkit.io was designed to democratize and bring the true essence of the Internet to Everything.  Our preview Modkit.io library for Wiring is focused on the most local network of things, the individual components connected to a single circuit board, and helping them communicate with each other more fluently than ever before.\nWho do we mean by Everyone?\nInspired by Scratch for beginners - Multithreaded and Event-driven for everyone\nMost text-based programming languages and other serious tools for technology creation are designed for engineers or computer scientists. With over 40 combined years of research and development in STEM education programs, Fab Labs and graphical programming languages such as Scratch and Modkit for VEX, we took a completely different approach and designed Modkit.io for Everyone. Just as text editors like Microsoft Word and Open Office are used everywhere from elementary school to grad school and by everyone from amateur lyricists to professional lawyers, we do not believe well designed tools have to appeal to only one audience or use case. We have seen graduate students at MIT struggle learning programming languages and young students from low-income neighborhoods excel at the same. This unique and broad exposure has led us to see far more commonalities than differences across novice and experienced programmers and it inspired and enabled us to design a programming language truly accessible to Everyone.\nRelated Languages\nModkit.io comes from a large family tree\nModkit.io is influenced by a large family tree and has benefitted from extensive interaction between its designer Ed Baafi and the designers of some of the most popular languages used by hobbyists and in education. For Ed it started over a decade ago, when Amon crossed the same bridge you see in our video carrying a flash drive containing Scratch, a new graphical programming language from his advisor Mitch Resnick's Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. Ed had experience teaching with Logo, one of Scratch's text-based predecessors, alongside one of its original designers Dr. Cynthia Solomon. Amon said that like Logo, Scratch was designed to make coding more accessible for kids and that just like hip-hop DJs would remix beats, vocals, and samples from existing material, Scratch was designed to let kids remix sounds, images and the programs that control them into whole new digital creations.\nHistory\nWe founded Modkit to bring the same accessibility as Scratch to microcontroller programming, originally targeting Arduino compatible development boards powered by the C++ based Wiring framework which itself has its own rich history. But Wiring/Arduino was single threaded, forcing programmers to coordinate everything in a single event loop and Modkit's early tools suffered this same limitation. If Scratch allows kids to remix like an experienced DJ with a set of turntables and a multitrack recorder, trying to remix with a single thread of control is like trying to mix with a single turntable and only one track. It's not impossible but you need a live band and you need to tightly coordinate everything. If you want to make any changes you usually have to redo the whole song. It wasn't until Modkit partnered with VEX Robotics to create Modkit for VEX, that we finally had the opportunity to bring a new language into the world. Originally called Wiring++ to honor Wiring's creator Hernando Barrag\u00e1n, Modkit.io has been in heavy development ever since and sits behind Modkit for VEX's powerful graphical programming blocks.\nFuture\nUnlike many Kickstarter campaigns that are complete when they produce a film, gadget, or electronic hardware and ship rewards to their backers, for Modkit.io our Kickstarter campaign is just the beginning. Once a physical item is shipped there is not much left to do but we understand that the nature of software is that it is never complete. This is why we are offering $1 rewards even before we start our campaign, but it is the same reason we need a critical mass of supporters and partners if we are to build a community around the Modkit.io language and meet that community's needs well into the future. We will update you about our plans for the future once we have reached our pre-goal, but if we fail to reach 1000 backers for $1 by June 1, we are afraid there may be no future for Modkit.io at all.\n\n\nRewards\n1000 Early Adopters get a single download of our Modkit.io Wiring library for Particle, TI Energia, and Arduino\nWhile Modkit.io is a programming language for Everything and Everyone, our pre-rewards are designed just for Early Adopters and Early Evangelists. Both rewards feature a preview release of the Modkit.io library that brings the Modkit.io language to popular Wiring-based editors such as the Arduino IDE, Particle Build and TI Energia. Early Adopters get a single download of the Modkit.io library for just $1 even before our Kickstarter campaign has actually begun. We believe that once you try our simple event driven multithreaded programming, and after we open up additional rewards, you'll want to increase your pledge so that you can continue to follow our development and make room for another early adopter to try it out.\n100 Early Evangelists get a Modkit flash drive to help spread the Modkit.io language and show support\nEarly Evangelists receive a limited edition Modkit flash drive that will only ship if our campaign is successful. Use it to share the Modkit.io updates you'll receive for one year from our funding completion. We know that many of our potential supporters are educators or members of local Makerspaces and Fab Labs so this is a great way to pass Modkit.io along to others. While it is too early to decide how we will license Modkit.io, the preview will be released under a special license that allows you to share it with your colleagues, friends, classmates and students. Help us spread the word and we'll be sure to add some more reward tiers as these begin to fill up.\nModkit Team\nThe core Modkit team met while designing and running the first of over one thousand worldwide Fab Labs as well as a one-of-a-kind youth maker program called Learn2Teach, Teach2Learn. In alphabetical order we are:\n\nEd Baafi is the lead instigator and founder of Modkit and the designer of the Modkit.io language. In 2011 he dropped out of the MIT Media Lab to focus on Modkit and hasn't looked back. From time to time he gets a chance to write including a chapter on hardware and software standards in Building Open Source Hardware. \n\nDr. Susan Klimczak is a self-proclaimed education geek who loves integrating art and technology in youth programs across Boston. She received a doctorate in education from Harvard University focusing on informal educational environments.  She is also a fellow in the FabLearn Fellows Program at Stanford University. \n\nDr. Amon Millner is Assistant Professor of Computing and Innovation at Olin College of Engineering.  While studying for his PhD with the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab, he helped design Scratch and related technologies. He is immortalized as a character in Scratch so you can program him to do your bidding.  \n\nCollin Reisdorf is the designer who focuses on the user interfaces and experience for Modkit's graphical programming tools.  He taught himself programming while studying design at MassArt and has designed experiences for some of the world's most recognizable brands before Ed convinced him to join Modkit.\n\n\nCredits\nModkit.io was designed and developed by Ed Baafi with support from VEX Robotics and inspired and adapted from Scratch from the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab.\n\n\"Modkit.io - the Most Important Technology\" stars Ismael and Sang, directed by Michael King and co-produced by Ed Baafi and Michael King.

We also already have the flash drives in hand which is currently our only physical reward. The biggest risk is for our company and for the future development of Modkit.io which cannot continue without significant support.\n\nLarge companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Google have historically been the only players who have built successful businesses around programming languages and we are aware that there are not many established paths for us to follow. But we are not deterred. We believe that the current state of hobbyist programming languages and tools is so far behind and so badly fragmented that educators, students, makers, hardware manufacturers, media outlets and other interested parties will get behind our efforts to change this and create a viable business around the Modkit.io language and tools.

Let your creations come to life as you light them up with LEDs, make noises with buzzers, and spin with the motor.\nWho is Squishy Circuits for?\nEveryone! Squishy Circuits has been used in classrooms, homes, libraries, and museums in all 50 states and over 20 countries. The stories and experiences we have heard are incredible, ranging from science fair exhibits to nursing home activities. Squishy Circuits has even been invited to the White House! \nSquishy Circuits is truly for all ages - we have led events with 3 year old students who easily grasp the basics with just a little individual attention and workshops with adults. \nHow does it Work?\nSquishy Circuits is very simple and is based on two play doughs - one that is conductive (electricity flows through it) and one that is insulative (does not allow electricity to flow through it). We are excited to have pre-made dough that you can purchase directly from our store, or you can make your own doughs with the provided recipes.\nPower is supplied by a 4AA battery pack and travels through the conductive dough to provide power to LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes), buzzers, or motors. \nSquishy Circuits are easy to make! View our Quick Start Guide or check out this video which walks through the most basic Squishy Circuit.\nWhat are Squishy Circuits Kits?\nLite Kit \u2013 The lite kit is the most basic kit and includes everything that you need to make your first Squishy Circuits light up quickly and easily. It is ideal for classrooms, parties, or events where every participant needs their own battery pack and wants to get started building right away.\nStandard Kit \u2013 The standard kit includes most of the components to be used with Squishy Circuits for more design creativity. It does not include dough, but the dough is easily made with the included recipes and common kitchen ingredients.\nDeluxe Kit \u2013 The deluxe kit is our most complete Squishy Circuits kit. It comes with more items than the standard kit and comes with pre-made doughs so you can start circuit building right away! This kit also includes a deluxe battery holder which has a knob that allows your lights to blink and buzzers to beep at different speeds.\nHow are these kits different than the older versions?\nCurrently we offer one Squishy Circuits Kit that is very similar to the new standard kit (view it on our current website and on Amazon), however we have made significant improvements and will be discontinuing the older style. \nThe newest generation of kits have a brand new design that is easier to manufacture, are more durable, and are safer.\nWhat do I get for Supporting this Kickstarter?\nWhy is your help needed?\nDevelopment and sourcing for the new Squishy Circuits Kits started in early 2015 and we have created strong relationships with our vendors. Now, we need the upfront capital to start production and meet our vendor's minimum order quantities. This is only possible with your support. \nFurthermore, we need your help to grow Squishy Circuits and bring hands-on STEM education to more people around the globe. Your support will allow us to expand the Squishy Circuits brand and develop additional projects.\nWe have an aggressive timeline and we are committed to delivering the new kits before the start of the new school year. \nWho is Behind Squishy Circuits Store?\nMy name is Matthew Schmidtbauer and my Squishy Circuits journey began in early 2011 when I was an electrical engineering student at the University of St. Thomas and had just started working with AnnMarie Thomas (the creator of Squishy Circuits) on the Squishy Circuits project. From the very beginning, I thought that Squishy Circuits was a fantastic idea \u2013 and I was very excited to be working on it. After attending several events, I realized that many people were looking for a single source for all of the components required for Squishy Circuits. As my mom stated, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have bought this for you growing up. I wouldn\u2019t know what to call these things, let alone where to buy them.\u201d \nAlthough developing a business plan, sourcing parts, and building a website were not necessarily things I thought I would be working on during my free time that spring, I started learning more about the process and finalized the Squishy Circuits Store idea. By June I had gained permission from AnnMarie, Sam (Squishy Circuits\u2019 previous student researcher and recipe developer), and St. Thomas to continue forward. On June 15, 2011, I filed the paperwork for Squishy Circuits Store LLC. \nArmed with a small loan from my parents, I ordered raw materials. Upon their arrival, it became quite clear that \u201csome assembly was required\u201d and my parents and I began producing Squishy Circuits Kits out of their basement and garage. By September I had the first versions of the Squishy Circuits Kits available online and had started selling them. Learning to juggle school, work, kit production, and everything that filled the spaces in-between proved to be challenge, but, looking back, I can only think of it as a positive, learning experience. \nProducing the very first Squishy Circuit Kit in late 2011\nFast-forwarding to present day, I am proud to have sold thousands of Squishy Circuits kits in over 20 countries around the world. Although no longer a student researcher for Squishy Circuits, I continue to be a proponent of the program and am a firm believer that learning can be accomplished through playing and self-discovery.\nAnnMarie Thomas and Matthew Schmidtbauer accepting a 2015 Eureka Award for Squishy Circuits\nAbout Squishy Circuits\nSquishy Circuits was developed at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota by AnnMarie Thomas. It began as a summer research project in her Playful Learning Lab with past student Sam Johnson, and quickly grew in popularity. It especially became popular when AnnMarie demonstrated it at TED in 2011. \nToday, the Playful Learning Lab continues to expand upon Squishy Circuits and works on developing new technologies. Squishy Circuits Store is proud to support the Playful Learning Lab by contributing a portion of all sales and developing new Squishy Circuits resources.\nMatthew and Playful Learning Lab students at the 2015 National Maker Faire in Washington DC", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDrawing upon our experience of selling thousands of Squishy Circuits Kits, and having spent over a year developing and sourcing components for the new kits, we are confident that they will be a high-quality product. We also believe that we have taken the appropriate actions to ensure a successful campaign and are even optimistic that our timeline will be accelerated and shipping may happen early.\n\nWe believe we have two major risks, mainly regarding quality and importing times. Regarding quality, we have done several prototype runs proving that our vendors can provide components built to our requirements. We will be testing many of the production parts and plan on ordering extra in case of defects. This will ensure the final products are high quality.\n\nOur vendors are primarily located overseas which means our products must be imported. In the past, we have had delays (port strikes, customs inspections, etc.) that have increased the importing process by weeks. We have built in some time so that if these unforeseen circumstances occur, we can still deliver on schedule.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #10", "update_userinfo": "Please help our friends with their monthly STEM kits!", "update_content": "We are excited to announce that things are on track for delivery in August or September (depending on your backing level), as originally promised.

Thimble is a unique direct-to-your-door monthly delivery subscription that contains a project with electronic components to teach kids and adults how to build a fun and useful device. \nOur very first kit we\u2019re launching through this Kickstarter is a WiFi-enabled robot that you control with your phone, tablet, or laptop. The robot arrives with everything you need to build the project and a learning app you log into to follow instructions. The learning app provides step-by-step tutorials to help you throughout the construction process and provides a community of other makers to share knowledge and best practices. \nBy making the Wi-Fi robot, you will:\ncreate an Android/iOS app that makes things move\nunderstand how electricity, motors, and microcontrollers work\nprototype your own ideas to improve the robot\nhave fun showing off your creation.\nGet all the parts to build your project\nFollow steps on our learning app to construct the kit\nYour first kit: a WiFi-controlled robot\nLearn to program the app that controls the robot\n Who is Thimble for? \nThimble kits are for curious minds - kids and adults (ages 13 and up) - interested in building electronics on a monthly basis that want a guided path to learn through step-by-step instructions on our learning app.\nFor ages 13+ (soldering is involved)\nMade for those curious about hardware and software: make things move!\nWhy Thimble?\nKids and adults want to be creative and develop the right technical skills to build something fun and useful. But they\u2019re hesitant to jump in because:\nthey don't have the right project ideas\nfinding components is time consuming\nthey don't have the knowledge to assemble their project\nThat whole experience is a massive barrier and we\u2019re going to fix it.  By offering monthly kits, we are bringing the makerspace to your home; it doesn\u2019t matter who you are or how old you are, people want to understand how individual electronic parts work together to make something function. As you progress from project to project, you will learn the art of soldering, programming languages, micro-controllers, and theory. Our hope is that you will learn enough to build, operate, and manipulate your own projects in the near future. \nPLAY\n\n The Mechanics:\nThe Wi-Fi robot is built around the Arduino microcontroller platform which may or may not be included in the kit depending on the reward level you select. The robot shield plugs into the Arduino and contains the motor controller and wifi module. You program the firmware (low level software) on the Arduino to talk to the Wi-Fi module in order to connect to your wireless network and receive commands from the internet to control the motors and make the robot move. The Thimble app that you program (for Android or iOS) then talks to the Wi-Fi module via the internet (UDP packets, specifically) to discover the robot on the network and send it commands to move forward, backward, left and right. We also show you how to add buttons to the app to read from sensors that you can add to the robot. \n Soldering is involved:\nAssembling components involves some soldering and can be accomplished by following instructions on our learning app in case you\u2019re unfamiliar. Additional tools will be required to assemble the project and future kits; they can be purchased on our website after the campaign and will be shipped with your reward (if you don't already own them). The tools you\u2019ll need are a soldering iron, soldering stand, solder, wire, wire cutters, diagonal cutters, a glue gun, and a screwdriver.\nWhat parts will I receive in my first kit?\n16 parts and you put it all together\nLearn how to assemble the robot and code by following tutorials on our learning app.  Once the robot has been constructed, kids and adults with no previous exposure to electronics or programming will easily figure out how to code the wifi-robot to move forwards, backwards, left, and right. If you\u2019re already a pro in some or all of these areas, you can skip over to see only the parts you\u2019re interested in. We will also guide you through writing an app for the robot which will work for iOS and Android devices.\nEasy-to-follow pictures, videos, and engaging community\nOnce you\u2019ve completed coding the robot, you can enjoy driving it around. If you\u2019re someone who likes to push the envelope, we encourage you to get creative - modify it and add components to the robot to make it do all sorts of things. This is truly where Thimble kits come alive! For example, add a sensor to make the robot avoid obstacles, or chase your dog around the house, or blink an LED when the lights are turned off! To get you started, we will show an example of how to read sensor data back to the app you develop. \nOnce you build the robot, program the app to make it move\n Our goal is pretty simple: To help you learn and build electronics in a more structured way. (without feeling overwhelmed!)\nFuture Kits:\nOther projects you could receive in later months include quadcopters, alarm clocks, LED cubes, light control devices for your home, weather monitoring, and more. If monthly is too frequent, or you just want to try the first kit out, we can ship kits when you\u2019d like them.\nSneak peek at our second kit: RGB LED cube with an integrated 9DOF IMU (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer)\nControl the color of every pixel (LED) of the cube, program it to react when you move or tap it\nOver this past summer, we did a one-month pilot program with the Boys and Girls Club of Buffalo to promote their STEAM curriculum. We had 12 students participate. Before the program, none of the students had experience with electronics, soldering, or software engineering and after it, 9 of the students wanted to become engineers and further pursue careers in software and hardware. To support that effort, we are partnering with the Boys and Girls club for a \"Give a Kid a Kit\" pay it forward initiative: if you would like, you can give a kit to a kid at the Buffalo Boys and Girls Club. We can also send it to a school or afterschool program in your local area. After the campaign is over, we will send out a survey asking where you would like the rewards that you selected to go.\nHow it all began...\nIn December 2014, Dave and Oscar met on Hacker News and quickly realized they shared the same passion for the maker movement. They met up in person and shared their goal to find ways to better engage kids and adults in electronics. Thimble was finally ignited by idea of month-to-month kits accompanied by a learning app that would provide seamless progression into hardware without feeling intimidated or demoralized.\nTogether, they\u2019ve been bootstrapping this idea for almost a year. It has taken them eight months to get everything ready for production; there was also the challenge of figuring out what parts should be included in the kit and what the educational content on the learning app should look like. All throughout, they\u2019ve spent their time learning about manufacturing electronics, meeting with manufacturers and suppliers, building relationships with partners, and designing future kits. They\u2019ve tested Thimble kits with Maker Spaces as well as organizations such as the Boys & Girls Club to make sure they\u2019re making something kids and adults will have fun learning and building.\nAlso, the team was recently accepted into New York\u2019s Next Top Makers Fellowship. It is a community-sourced incubator dedicated to connecting ideas like Thimble with local development in NYC.  \nDavid Brenner and Oscar Pedroso\nA big thank you to our friends and family whose support has helped make this campaign possible.

Install micro-controllers inside diamond skulls. We think the gallery world should just be slightly more fun. We think we can accomplish a part of that with huge hearts and a fist-full of wire.\nMediaLounge is on a mission to blow minds. We're sticking cutting edge artists, art works and advocates into the same space and shaking it up. We're going to put tools in the hands of the public by hosting workshops from the very people who are developing award winning software and hardware that make digital art possible.

Click on each to be directed to their project page on medialoungenyc.com.\n    From 2009-2010 MediaLounge presented the work of over 100 artists. We gave them time, space, and resources to realize their visions. Uncoiled, ran, tangled, struck, untangled, and coiled over 500,000 miles of cables.

That means good songs with a sense of humor, soulfully played, packed with hooks, and bursting with aural pleasure.\n*Update 11/4: We've hit the first two stretch goals! I've just added the \"Magic Pack\" reward. This reward and all others above $222 will include this limited-edition David Hale LUNA MOTH print (the same design I have tattooed on my right arm):\nThe Songs\nI've got a menagerie of original songs on hand, and here's what they're saying:\nLive joyfully, live playfully, live honestly. Pleasure is good for you. Sex is fun. Shame is a waste of time. Women are powerful superheroes. Respect yourself. Fuck the haters. Loneliness hurts but we need it. Love hurts but it is also the point of living. Feel love (and pleasure, and everything) often, and with relish.\nHere are two of the songs that will be featured on the album. These are demos, and have not yet blossomed into the fullness of their pop glory, but I think they give a hint of the possibilities!\nHot Night:\n Ravenous:\n If you'd like to hear the rest of these demos, plus the other songs we're taking into the studio, become a backer!\nThe Money\nI'm asking for $22,000. What I actually need to complete the record is $29,500. Whatever I don't make here, I will borrow (or steal, or beg for). To realize my ultimate vision for the record, which includes extra studio time and more musicians, I need about $36,000. To hire a publicity team who will see that the album gets heard far and wide, I need about $50,000.\nMy ultimate stretch goal is $69,000. If I were to reach that (incredible, beautiful, astronomical) number, I could make music videos for three of the singles from the album, hire the best (and fanciest) publicist in the business, and order additional CDs and vinyl. And, of course, sexy numbers are good luck.\nFor more info on the budget, scroll down.\nWho do you think you are?\nI'm a singer/songwriter living in New Orleans (by way of Philadelphia PA, Eugene OR, and Luray VA). I've been making records for ten years, writing and performing for fifteen, and singing my whole life. I've been interviewed on NPR and toured as an opener for Paul Simon, The Weepies, The Wood Brothers and many more. My last Kickstarter made over $60K, and resulted in a damn fine record, too.  \nNew to my music? Catch up at www.carsieblanton.com!   \nThink crowdfunding is the bomb? I agree. Visit my Patreon page!\nWhy pop?\nWell... I love pop. I love the attitude of pop: playful, joyful, unabashed, hedonistic. I love the sound of pop: melodic, lush, groove-laden, hook-driven. And I love so many of the artists who have been called \"pop\" over the last century: Nat King Cole, Paul Simon, Carole King, Michael Jackson, Dolly Parton, right up to Beyonce and Bruno Mars.\nI also love that pop is not really a genre. It spans all genres, but has no allegiance to any. The Beatles, for example, were only a rock band until about \"Rubber Soul\". Then, they were something else; something which included baroque horn concertos, Hindustani classical music, and English children's folk songs. As a musician with an equally feverish love of Ella Fitzgerald, Joni Mitchell, Queen, and Prince, this approach strikes me as the ultimate expression of musical freedom, creativity, and playfulness.\nBut, in case you think \"pop\" is a dirty word, let me remind you that all of the aforementioned artists, PLUS Bob Dylan, had multiple hit songs. In other words: historically speaking, a lot of pop songs have been smart, soulful, well-crafted, and honest. I plan to make a few more of those.\nWhy Pleasure?\n\"We must risk delight. We must have the stubbornness to accept our gladness in the ruthless furnace of this world.\" - Jack Gilbert\nI subscribe to the radical notion that pleasure is good for you (and for me, and for all of us). Pleasure is a source of joy, inspiration, connection and aliveness. It relaxes us, invigorates us, and re-connects us to ourselves and each other. I'm not talking about the shallow pleasure of Oreos and reality TV (not to knock either), but the deep-soul-pleasure of making love, night-time swimming, vigorous cuddling, and good, sweet, true music. \nFor me, music is the ultimate hedonistic pursuit: I make it, and listen to it, and love it, just cus it feels so dang good. This is the attitude I'll be bringing into the studio; become a backer if you want to hear what I bring back out.\nPhoto by Bobby Bonsey\nThe Team\nBesides the songs, I've got two weeks of scheduled studio time (in January), and a plan to attack this project with moxie and playfulness. But better yet, I've got a group of disgustingly talented musicians who are ready and willing to make this crazy thing happen.\nOur merry band of pranksters includes: Pete Donnelly, founding member of The Figgs and producer of my 2009 record 'Buoy' (as well as many other excellent records); Joe Plowman, bassist extraordinaire, friend and collaborator since 2009; Pat Firth, NYC pianist and jazz/pop/R&B aficionado; and Jano Rix, world-class drummer/percussionist/vocalist/melodica player/salsa dancer.\nThese guys are talented. But not only that; they are silly. And smart. And committed. They know that the point is to feel good, and play with feeling. And between them, they can draw on a massive sea of musical references.\nI am confident that with this crew, a lot of playfulness, and a little good luck, I can make anything I can imagine.\nThe Budget\nHere is a more detailed breakdown of costs for my original ($29,500) goal.\n \"Recording Costs\" include:\nPaying the producer and the musicians who play on the record.\nStudio time, lodging, and food during the recording sessions.\n\"Design and Manufacturing\" includes:\nPrinting CDs and pressing vinyl records.\nPaying for cover art design.\n\"Kickstarter Costs\" include:\nKickstarter takes a 5% fee from the funds collected.\nAmazon payments takes another 3% for credit card processing.\nMy estimated expenses for Kickstarter rewards not included in other parts of the budget.\nThe Take-Home\nThank you, in advance, for every penny you're willing to part with. I am grateful every day for the people that make it possible for me to sit in my little pink studio (The Watermelon, pictured below) and write songs; or to hunker down with my favorite musicians and turn those songs into a record. \nI feel blessed and honored, 100% of the time, to make music. (Yes, even when I am cranky.) I love this work, and I love you for making it possible. I don't take this opportunity lightly (though I do, of course, take it playfully). \nI love you madly!\nCarsie\nPhoto by Bobby Bonsey", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI'll be the first to admit: good pop is hard to make. If it wasn't hard, there would be a lot more of it. It's hard to write a song that is true and good and bursting with hook and melody; but I believe I have a few up my sleeve. It's hard to create a delectable aural confection like \"All You Need Is Love\" or \"You Send Me\" or \"Where Did Our Love Go?\", but goldang it, I'm willing to try.\n\nOther than that, my struggle (as always) is trying to operate respectably here in the material world.

The mobile app used to play totems is called Stylus.\nTotems are encoded with music and visuals that can be played back using the Stylus mobile app.\nOur platform lets artists express their music in physical and visual form, and gives fans an interactive, multi-sensory experience that they can share with others. REIFY is a new medium of creative expression for artists, and a deeper, connected music experience for fans.\nWe've spent the last 9 months building and testing our platform in direct collaboration with musicians. Now we've partnered with a group of amazing artists on this Kickstarter to release their music on totems, to fans everywhere.\nHEALTH, mae, YACHT and Tim Fain are REIFY early adopters designing totems for this Kickstarter.\nEvery totem can feel as unique as the song it represents.\n                                                      Close up of a 3d printed PLA totem.\nClose up of a 3d printed PLA totem.\nClose up of a cast bronze totem.\nWe\u2019ve designed hundreds of experimental totems for many different kinds of music. Through many beautiful trials and educational errors we've established an audio-to-physical design process where each totem can look and feel as unique as the song it represents...while remaining structurally sound.\nWe've prototyped our totem fabrication processes to find a balance between creative flexibility and lasting, physical objects. The rewards for this Kickstarter will be 3D printed in PLA plastic, with limited editions cast in bronze.\nWhen not being used to experience music in a whole new way through the Stylus mobile app, each totem is also a beautiful stand-alone art object. Imagine having your favorite music live in your home as physical art you can hold, display and share.\nTotems are also stand-alone art objects you can hold, display and share.\nThe opening scene of HEALTH's Dark Enough experience.\nOur free Stylus player app will be available on iOS at public launch. We also have a functional Android version that we plan to get ready for public release late spring next year.\nWhen a fan points their mobile device camera at a totem, the Stylus app plays back a music and interactive visual experience, also designed with the artist.\nEach experience is unique in style and content. Some are game-like. Some are conceptual explorations. Others are both...and neither. All are direct expressions of the artist's creative vision.\nEach totem experience is unique in style and content. This is an untouched real time capture of HEALTH's Dark Enough experience.\nAnother untouched live shot of HEALTH's Dark Enough experience.\nTotem experiences can be incredibly detailed. These untouched real time shots were taken from a mobile camera about 4 inches away from the HEALTH Dark Enough totem.\nWorking with HEALTH to create a totem for their single, Dark Enough.\n1. MAPPING\nWhen we partner with an artist we first provide a range of visual interpretations of a specific song, in the form of abstract 3D models. These models are based on both the artist's creative goals and the automated mapping of various musical attributes to physical and visual ones by Harmony, our custom audio-to-physical engine and parametric design software.\n2. DESIGN\nUsing these models as a starting point, we work with the artist to design a custom totem that matches their creative intentions and visual aesthetic. We also collaborate to create an interactive visual experience which includes and represents the song. The creative choices and decisions made for each totem are saved and learned by our system, and used to improve our generated Mapping models for every collaboration that comes after.\n3. PRODUCTION\nOnce both are complete, we 3D print the totem and encode it with the experience using Unity and Vuforia. The combined experience of physical, audio and visual can take nearly any linear, exploratory or other form of narrative the artist wants to create for their fans.\n4. RELEASE\nFans who purchase the totem and download our free Stylus app can play back the music and interactive visuals on their mobile device, experiencing the artist's song through sound, sight and touch.\nOur Harmony software learns the creative choices made by each artist, improving every collaboration that comes after.\nYACHT - \"Music is by nature immaterial, but people need something to hold onto, to help make it feel concrete. Physical albums used to serve that purpose; the death of the physical album, in a way, opens up new possibilities beyond vinyl and acetate. We've always been interested in designing objects and experiences around our music, but REIFY's concept of a totem that embodies the sound itself is light-years ahead. We're early adopters.\"\nHEALTH\nmae - \"Sometimes things aren't lost in translation, they are FOUND in translation. 100 years ago Wassily Kandinsky said that \"The arts are encroaching one upon another, and from a proper use of this encroachment will rise the art that is truly monumental.\" Kandinsky used his paint to SHOW us music. Now, 100 years later, technology has given us the ability to SEE music in a new way yet again. REIFY is taking music beyond the realm of sound and into the realm of the multisensory aesthetic experience.\"\nTim Fain \nIvy Ross, VP Google, Head of Glass - \"I have been waiting to be able to not just live in rhythm, but to hold it in my hands. Reify ignites this new blending of the senses in a way that will provoke more questions then answers, which is the best part of our journey.\"\nJake Friedman, Manager/Co-Founder, We Are Free - \"In this moment of 'on demand' everything, Reify has created a new physical format. And that format promises to return ritual and aura to recorded music. Who wouldn't be excited about that?\"\nPaste Magazine - \"The swirling structures are artful representations that could just as easily be seen in your living room as in a museum.\"\nColossal - \"Sound wave interpretations in your hands, as 3d-printed sculptures.\"\nThe Creator's Project - \"Music becomes tactile and textured.\"\nBloomberg Business - \"It's hard not to get excited about staring your favorite song right in the face.\"\nThe Wall Street Journal - \"Shapes that can be printed and then played back with an app that divines the sound from a scan of the object made to represent it.\"\nTeen Vogue - \"How One Girl Turned Her Favorite Songs Into Sculptures with Computer Software\"\nThe REIFY pins and stickers include an interactive visual you can play with the Stylus app!\nWe've been a self-funded full time project until now.

Suppliers may miss a deadline, a machine may start malfunctioning or a shipment can get lost. Those things can cause delays, Nevertheless, to minimize any setbacks and inconveniences, we are going to work with the most reliable suppliers, manufacturing plants and shipping agencies, to ensure you get your rewards by the intended delivery date.\n\nDESIGN\n\nThe physical form for each artist's REIFY totem is designed by REIFY and that artist, using our custom software. The Stylus experiences for each totem are designed by REIFY, that artist and an digital artist versed in 3D motion graphics and working directly in Unity. \n\nHEALTH's totem and full Stylus experience are complete and ready to move to production. We've begun initial concepting and collobration with some of the other Kickstarter artists. \n\nGiven the variable nature of any creative collaboration among multiple artists and designers, each full project may take different amounts of time and effort to reach production-ready designs. Potential delays to production could occur if design time extends past what we planned for.\n\nMANUFACTURING\n\nWe're partnered with Voodoo manufacturing for 3D printed totems and a private bronze casting partner in NYC for the numbered edition totems. \n\nThe HEALTH totem's manufacturing process has been tested and confirmed. Optimizing for production of that totem at scale is currently underway. Fabrication testing and optimization for the other artist's totems will depend on the complexity of the final physical designs, materials, etc.\n\nWe're working closely with Voodoo and our bronze partner, and using our experience from our work with HEALTH, to predict and remedy any manufacturing challenges before we move to mass production. Potential production delays could happen if an artist's desired design proves a high effort to fabricate, needs to be reworked for predictable printing or casting, etc.\n\nPACKAGING AND FULFILLMENT\n\nOur totems are to be packaged and fulfilled from a dedicated location in Brooklyn. Our design, manufacturing and packaging facilities are all within 1 mile of each other. We have sufficient storage space to fulfill at scale. \n\nWe have a plan for fullment that requires a dedicated production management hire + knowing just what and where we're shipping all our rewards, in order to confirm our predications on effort and time for delivering rewards. Both will happen upon Kickstarter rewards successful funding our campaign.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "REIFY\nFirst created \u00b7 9 backed\nREIFY is a group of designers and engineers who use technology to create cross-sensory experiences of sound.

I grew up as a math and science guy that loved comics and my dad taught me to read using comics. I know for a fact that comics work! Now that I have two children of my own I\u2019ve worked to get my own kids interested in STEM. I did not find the existing materials to be very engaging. I am convinced that comics are a better way to getting this information into the hands of kids.\nMy dream is to eventually create a SERIES of these STEM career comics for kids. Each comic will focus on a STEM job and give some insight into what that job is like, what they would spend their days doing, and what kind of money they can make. Each story will show how a middle school kid became a STEM professional.  \nREWARDS - In our reward section we describe a variety of packages that you can use to bring \u201cDavid, Software Engineer\u201d into your classroom, groups or communities. Our packages are designed to fit the needs of most school classrooms, groups and communities, but every situation is a bit different. If you\u2019d like to describe your class, group or community size and composition we can recommend a package appropriate for you. Contact me at: pgamble422@att.net\nSTRETCH GOAL - Reaching the stretch goal of $25,000 will provide enough funding to do storyboarding, writing and preliminary art for a draft of a SECOND STEM Career Comic Book as we've done for \"David, Software Engineer\". All backers of $15 or more will be able to vote for the Stem Career of the 2nd Book through a short survey!!!!\nHere is a list of possible careers for a second Stem Career Comic Book: Aerospace Engineer, Architect, Cellular Biologist, Civil Engineer, Electrical Engineer, Marine Scientist, Mathematician, Mechanical Engineer, Nuclear Engineer and Petroleum Technologist. Let us know what career you would suggest making into a 2nd book.\nKids need to know that the jobs that will allow them to live a life of their dreams are in the STEM fields. We need to draw a connection between their school efforts and their future lives\u2026this is where communication has been failing between parents and children and teachers and students.\nUnfortunately, the depicted parental lecture scene is happening all over the country.  Instead of lecturing your kid (again and again) my comic provides you with an alternative for getting STEM career-related information to your kids in a format they will listen to.\nThere are more forecasted STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) jobs then we have students in the pipeline. We know those jobs are among the highest paid.\nKids are losing interest in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math).\nKids continue to tell us they do not understand how math and science are relevant to their future. They want to know how that the Algebra I class they do not like impacts their future career and lifestyle. The lack of relevancy leads to disinterest, lack of motivation and decreased engagement.\nMaterials are needed that Engage, Stimulate Interest and Expose kids to STEM concepts and careers that focus on WIIFT (What's In It For Them).\nBut don\u2019t take my word for it, check out some of the great feedback I have received from kids about the draft of my comic.\nI loved comic books as a kid (and STILL Do!), and I realize that a better way to expose kids to STEM is through a series of comic books focused on STEM careers. \nI\u2019ve been working on this idea for quite a while and have already made up two drafts of the comic.  I\u2019d like to introduce you to \"David, Software Engineer\". \nDavid, like most other students, has no idea what he wants to be when he grows up. David is always messing around and fiddling with phones, calculators, and computers. His interests seem to be more on gadgets than actual studies and therefore throughout middle school and high school he gets tutored by a girl named Carlie. What he didn't realize was that if he just applied what knowledge he used with his gadgets and gizmos to everyday life, he would be just fine. While being tutored by Carlie, he realizes he likes her but is too shy to say so. Will David ever find out how he can better apply his unique skills towards his future? Will he ever get the courage to tell Carlie how he feels? \nIn showing my first draft to kids I've got input that indicated I needed to make some changes for girls. I have modified the comic book so that it appeals to both Girls and Boys. The feedback has been positive from both boys and girls. We\u2019re now ready to finish things up and move forward.\nWhile the work of developing the comic book is nearly complete, we need your help to finish up \"David, Software Engineer\" and to build up a community interested in bringing the STEM careers message to students in comic book form. \n\"David, Software Engineer\" is different than other career-related materials in that:\n1. It has an engaging story  \n2. It uses graphic art to add to the \"text\" in the story  \n3. It includes career-related information from the viewpoint of a young person\n4. Maps the necessary skills, knowledge and attributes of a STEM career to specific middle and high school classes\nSample - Career-related content\nI am also creating Educator, Student and Parent Guides to make the comic book a more effective educational tool.\nThe guides will focus on Vocabulary, Guided Discussion, Discussion Questions, Post Reading Activities, Character Analysis, Standards, Additional Activities, Knowledge Gained, Graphic Organizers and Guided Reading.\nStudent's Guide Sample Page\nAll of the educators that have reviewed the unfinished guides have commented on how helpful and useful they are.\nBy supporting this Kickstarter you are helping get \"David, Software Engineer\" into the hands of the audience it is designed for...KIDS!\nYour support will allow me to do the following:  \n1. Print and deliver comic books to parents with kids, schools and other organizations that serve youth to begin to make a DIFFERENCE  \n2. Create and provide access to digital copies of the comic book for mobile devices  \n3. Research and Identify another STEM career with a Female main character for a 2nd Comic Book \n4. Identify an audience for delivering career-related information about a STEM career in a comic book \n5. Collect feedback on how to Better the product moving forward", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project there are no guarantees. This project has three key areas of risk: content creation, delivery of promised rewards and communication.\n\nContent creation - I have created drafts of the comic book. I understand the process of collaborating with writers/artists and making changes. \n\nDelivery of promised rewards - I have a background in project management and I am used to delivering things on a deadline. I am good at creating a schedule and following up to make sure things get done. \n\nCommunication - A lack of communication can lead to unmanaged expectations and a poor relationship which will reflect poorly on the project.

Light up your robot, house, or spaceship! Our Build Upons are based on the smallest 1x1 brick we could fit an LED into to create elegant and flexible designs. The Build Upons system has three types of bricks: an LED brick, a power brick, and a bridge brick. \nYou can power an LED brick by stacking it directly on top of a power brick, or use the bridge brick to route power to LEDs throughout your design, allowing LEDs to be placed anywhere! \nThis 3D printed prototype shows an LED brick stacked on a bridge brick stacked on a power brick.\nThe bridge bricks allow for flexibility within the design. The below examples use the bridge bricks to route power from the battery pack to the LED bricks, wherever the LED bricks happen to be. The bridge bricks function even when turned 90 degrees!\nBuild a Helicopter!\nThese are only a few of the projects that highlight our bricks, we can't wait to see what you do!\nWe have created these prototype bricks, but we need you to get to a production run!\n                                                         Specs and Process\nThis product will be released as open source hardware upon shipping! Trust us - Alicia wrote the book on it.\nWe are using standard surface mount white LEDs in the bricks powered by a 4.5v battery pack. AA batteries not included. The bricks have metal running through the top and bottom creating connections where they stack. We have gone through several prototyped designs, improving each one. \nHere is a walk through of our design changes in R&D.\nEach iteration reflects a change to make our product more manufacturable and easy to assemble. We are now in our fourth major design iteration and ready for production. The earliest prototype was done with 3D printing, copper tape, and inserting LEDs into a plastic brick by hand, which was time consuming and tedious. In order to build lots of these bricks we need to invest in injection molding. \nThe Team\nThis was the only photo that Puppet had her eyes open.\n *Alicia Gibb* Alicia Gibb is the CEO of Lunchbox Electronics.

Frustrated with the lack of opportunities for scientific exploration present in the traditional classroom environment, in 2008 Ramsey began hosting summer science camps for Bay Area youth designed to transcend traditional curriculum and expose students to the wonders of inquiry. STEM SLAM weekends have emerged from Ramsey's original ethos, but aim to provide young minds with a chance to explore a specific area of interest during the regular school year. \n\nAfter a weekend of cutting edge exploration removed from paradigm of traditional schooling, participants will return to their respective classrooms with a kit of materials and associated lesson plans in hand ready to empower their peers and teacher(s).

We believe that our chocolate is some of the healthiest available on the market today, based on our commitment to organic and sustainable farming and wild-harvesting practices, the origin of our unique unroasted heirloom cacao, low-glycemic sweeteners, and the diverse selection of exotic botanicals and supplements we infuse into our products. As a modern social enterprise, we invest our profits into local communities and projects, with a special interest in preserving the legacies of the people and communities that have made it possible for you to enjoy the botanicals, spices, and cacao we use to make our modern vintage chocolates.\nFor this Kickstarter campaign, we are raising a portion of the money we need to invest in new packaging that will allow us to put our best chocolate bars on the shelves at local grocery stores, along with some new equipment that we need to help us meet current production demands.\nIn my own words... \nThis Kickstarter will really help me take the company to the next stage in our evolution. I'll be using the funds raised here for two separate needs that the company currently has - packaging and equipment. For our packaging, I am committed to using 100% recyclable and/or compostable materials that are ethically and sustainably manufactured. To make these ethics meet the reality of our business needs, we'll need to purchase and print our packaging in bulk, which will require a significant initial investment. So while the initial costs will be high, we'll be able to maintain our ethics, keep the costs of our bars lower, and pass along these savings to everyone who purchases them from a grocery store or local market. Additionally, we'll need a more efficient tempering machine to mold our bars and enrobe our truffles, which will allow us to further decrease our production costs - a savings that we will again be passing along to all of our fans. In the end, I hope to produce chocolates that are ethically sourced, as healthy & nutritious as possible, and made with the highest quality ingredients available today, all while maintaining an affordable price point for our fans. I really hope to make the world a better place with every chocolate I produce, from the cacao growers, to our environmentally-friendly packaging, to one day being able to use the profits of the company to support ecolgical stewardship and human rights efforts related to our mission. By supporting this Kickstarter, you'll help us make our ethics meet the reality of business, and get some absolutely amazing chocolates in return. Every contribution you make will help secure a more sustainable future for our small, mission-driven company.

Inspired by the Tinkering School started by Gever Tulley in the Bay Area (check out his TED talk here), we saw a need and opportunity to inspire the next generation of ATX Makers, hackers, and inventors. Austin has always been a haven for the DIYers, craftivists, tech-savvy innovators, and think-outside-the-box-ers and we needed a school that not only could teach skills but provide access to space, tools, and materials so kids and adults could design, build, create, as well as strengthen their ability to problem solve, collaborate, and innovate.  \nAnyway, here we are, 5 years later.  We've built go-carts, roller coasters, pinball machines, tree forts, hovercrafts, 2 story waterslides, and countless other projects both big and small.   We've offered classes in arduino, robotics, raspberry pi, and 3D printing.  We've had guest Makers teach classes in enameling, video game design, concrete casting, soap making, and lots more.  We even started the Austin Mini Maker Faire (now in it's 4th year), which is a two-day, family-friendly event to MAKE, create, craft, learn, play, invent, and be inspired.  So let's just say we are ALL about the Making.\nAnd we are SO ready to move out of the backyard and into a centrally located, community oriented, kid- and family-friendly Makerspace!  We want to bring these meaningful hands-on Maker experiences to more kids and adults all over Austin.  We also need a Tinkermobile (a truck with a dedicated set of tools and locking tool boxes) so that we can more easily bring tinkering projects to schools, rec centers, afterschool programs, churches, events, and everywhere that kids are found.  \nWe would like to find a warehouse, old auto repair shop, or other industrial space with a fenced-in side yard (kids need playspace and room to build big) for around $2000 a month.  The amount of funding we are attempting to raise will provide us with a $1000 per month towards rent for one year , which will ease our financial situation considerably, and will allow us to establish ourselves at the new location.  $4000 to spend on a used truck for our Tinkermobile would be fantastic.  The remainder would go towards Kickstarter fees and expenses, as well as remodeling of our new space, signage, and a few new tools.\nAnd Boy Howdy yes do we have stretch goals!\n$1000 for a welding set-up \n$2100 for a Blacktooth Laser Cutter \n$2000 for additional computers and software \n$1000 for a kiln\n$2200 for a Makerbot Replicator 2 3d printer\n$5000 for a desktop Shopbot\n$5000 would enable us to buy a stepvan and to create a more complete Tinkermobile.\n$12,000 for another year in the new space!\nKids love tinkering.

Much like people, musical instruments evolve over time. Sometimes these evolutions are the result of changes in musical styles, and sometimes they are the cause of them. And either way, it's hard to imagine an instrument that is more in need of a radical change than the DJ's turntable.\nYes, there have been some changes to the turntable since it started being used as a musical instrument, but these changes still adhere to the same basic design -- a design which, let's face it, was never meant for cutting and scratching. Turntables are fragile and sensitive; that delicate needle sits precariously in the groove and bounces around with the slightest jostling. Scratching is incredibly difficult and frustrating.  Now it's certainly true that the things that make musical instruments difficult are sometimes the very things that give them their signature sound. But in the case of turntablism, I think that an easier user interface could open up a galaxy of sonic possibilities. Imagine instantly alternating between parallel playlists, or creating layers of sound by using each of your hands to do the work of a separate DJ. Imagine routing a singer's microphone into a device that lets you scratch with live audio in near-real time!\nOver the past few years, I've been developing the specifications for a more versatile and intuitive way to scratch, without the latency of digital or the fragility of vinyl. Your donations will be used to hire a product design firm to build a functional prototype of my device, which I'm calling The ScrubBoard. With The ScrubBoard, you scratch by moving a slider up and down a track, much like how you'd move the sliders on a standard mixing board. But the ScrubBoard's slider doesn't adjust volume levels; instead, it's internally attached to a movable tape head that makes contact with a strip of audio tape inside the device. As you move the slider, the tape head moves up and down the tape, thus generating a true analog scratch.\nAn important part of the turntable arts is the DJ\u2019s use of a switch or fader to rhythmically mute and un-mute the audio from the turntable. This is commonly referred to as \u201ccutting.\u201d With the ScrubBoard, you achieve this effect by using a two-fingered push-button that sits atop the slider. I call it the Seesaw Killswitch, because pressing down on one side makes the other side come up. When either side is pressed down, the audio is un-muted. When it\u2019s in the \u201chalfway position\u201d (with neither side all the way down) the audio is muted. Users can open and close the audio signal by alternately pressing with their index and middle fingers, and they can grasp the slider with their other fingers, thus allowing them to cut and scratch with the same hand.\nPressing either side of the Seesaw Killswitch all the way down un-mutes the audio.\nSo why would you want to cut and scratch with the same hand? Because you can use a second ScrubBoard with your other hand! With two ScrubBoards, a skilled scratcher could create a pretty impressive interlocking, polyphonic sound that would be impossible using traditional equipment, even with two people. After all, two musicians will never be as perfectly in sync as your own two hands are with each other.\nWhile the Seesaw\u2019s halfway position always has the effect of muting the audio, the effects of pressing down the right and left sides can be customized.  That's because the ScrubBoard uses the audio tape's four tracks to create two stereo playlists that run alongside each other, and it uses a dual crossfader system to route the audio to the two sides of the Seesaw.  Adjust Crossfader 1 to determine which playlist you\u2019ll hear when pressing down the left side of the Seesaw.  Adjust Crossfader 2 to determine which playlist you\u2019ll hear when pressing down the right side.  \nKeeping both crossfaders on the same side allows you to double your cutting speed with one playlist. Keeping them on opposite sides allows you to instantly seesaw between the two playlists. \nAt this point, you may have noticed a problem with all of this: Movable tape heads might be great for scratching, but turntablists do more than just scratch. A big part of turntablism is the controlled use of the turntable motor's automatic rotation. In other words, sometimes you need to just let the record spin.  So for straight playback, The ScrubBoard makes use of a motorized tape loop.  But unlike a standard tape loop, this loop uses a conveyor-belt design so that the play head is able to slide up and down the slider track without losing contact with the tape.\nThe \"conveyor-belt\" tape loop\nThe audio tape is mounted to the center of a loop belt, which is held taught by two rubber rollers. The loop belt has a writable surface, so users can hand-label all the transient audio events and then follow their movement as the loop belt turns.\nTo preserve one-handed functionality, the controls for the loop belt transport are on the slider. While grasping the slider\u2019s base with your pinky, ring finger, and thumb, you can control the loop belt transport by twisting the grips on the base. Twist them to the left, and the loop belt will roll forward. Twist to the right and the loop belt will roll backward.\nNotice how the user is interacting with the orange grips on the slider's base.\nThe grips will snap back to a neutral position and the belt will stop rolling when you stop twisting them. You can change the speed at which the belt rolls by adjusting the IPS control, which is above the crossfaders.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf my fundraiser is successful, I'll be working with the Bay Area product design firm Connekt, LLC, which will handle the CAD modeling, electrical engineering, and the manufacture of a working prototype. Because the ScrubBoard has not yet been engineered, Connekt could not give me an exact estimate for the manufacturing phase, so instead they have given me a \"not to exceed\" figure, which is the basis for my fundraising goal. This means I'll likely have leftover funds to reinvest in the ScrubBoard after the prototype is complete. But it is also possible that manufacturing will cost more than expected. If this is the case, I will sacrifice some of the ScrubBoard's functionality to keep costs down. That being said, Connekt, LLC has a solid reputation for providing quality, cost-effective design services, and I have every confidence that they will be able to complete my project within the budget they've indicated.\n\nThis prototype is meant to demonstrate the core concepts of the ScrubBoard, and as such will not feature all of the functionality mentioned in the promotional materials, regardless of whether there are budget concerns. The \"ScrubBoard Guitar\" attachment (mentioned in the video) will probably not be included. Also, the loop belt will not be housed in a removable cart, but instead will be permanently built into the console.\n\nFor more info on Connekt, LLC:\nhttp://connektllc.com/\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Jeremy Bell\nFirst created \u00b7 1 backed\nI was born to work with audio.
