This poster is part of the Limited Edition Poster Reward.\n\nNeedless to say, we fully agree with this. We had been dedicated to filmmaking for more than 20 years before we embarked on the adventure of starting our own flip book publishing house, and we loved the idea of doing a project that combined both worlds: flip books and cinema.\nTHE PIONEERS is a tribute to these very earliest trailblazers. A collection of ten cinemagic flip books that represent the essence of their works, the very first projects involving the moving image ever made. \nThis collection is a declaration of love for those pioneering talents who sowed the seeds of a revolution that is now a fundamental part of our lives: the cinema.\nIt was no easy task to narrow down the selection of outstanding pioneers to ten. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, these innovators spent years refining their techniques, implementing new technologies and discovering unique optical tricks in no way inferior to those of modern-day YouTubers and TikTokers.\nDuring our research we kept coming across female pioneers, great creators who managed to assert themselves in a male-dominated world, but unfortunately very few of their works have survived, and they have now largely fallen into obscurity. We are proud to include two of them, namely the great Alice Guy-Blach\u00e9 and Lotte Reiniger, in this selection.\nFinally, we have come to a great lineup of ten visionary figures, who we consider to be major revolutionaries in their field, whether from the primitive beginnings of the moving image, such as the phenakistiscope and chronophotography, or from the early days of cinematography, animation, optical tricks and the first forms of on-screen narrative.\nScroll down to discover each of the people who make up this collection in more detail.\nThose of you familiar with the Flipboku flip books know that we like a little magic! Our flip books feature a clever trick that owes its success to a sophisticated assembly technique, and this is why we call them cinemagic flip books. As a result, when flipping the pages of the book, you can see up to six different animations instead of one or two like in a normal flip book. Let the entertainment commence!\nThis eye-popping optical illusion allows us to include an impressive 60 film sequences in The Pioneers Collection, representing the first decades of the history of the moving image, from the phenakistiscope to the first colorized films.\nOur cinemagic flip books are surprisingly easy to use and provide an unfailing source of delight to viewers of all generations.\n\nBut there\u2019s more to discover with this collection: in addition to the six film sequences hidden inside the flip book, each edition features a micro-documentary on the life of the respective pioneers, which adds an extra dimension to the experience of learning about their work. These documentaries will be incorporated into each of the flip books using augmented reality and are viewable by simply scanning the cover with a smartphone or tablet.  \nThis feature allows us to add another dimension to the Pioneers Collection as well as an extra educational resource - it's a great way to learn more about each artist's life, their background and their most outstanding works. The feature will be available thanks to an easy-to-use iOS and Android app developed by our friends from Artivive, a revolutionary AR company based in Vienna, Austria.\nTo access the AR content, simply scan the QR code included in the flip book, install the Artivive App, open it and view the flip book on your screen. Easy peasy!\nIt was important to us to not only create a pleasing artifact for people's bookshelves but also to give the edition an additional educational purpose, bringing the stories of each pioneer to younger generations in a fun and interactive way. We have taken the collection to schools and film schools and have received exceptionally good feedback both from the students and teachers.\nStudents can discover the film material in an engaging interactive way using a medium that represents a precursor of cinema itself, while at the same time, thanks to augmented reality, the collection bridges the gap between old-school and cutting-edge technology. A truly unique educational tool for all generations.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this edition, we have taken great care with the details.\nSince most of the sequences are in black and white, we liked the idea of contrasting the design with a vibrant color palette, using elements from the film footage for the cover pages and sleeves.\nSome of the creators, whose projects preceded the cinema itself, worked with inventions such as the phenakistiscope in the case of Joseph Plateau or chronophotographic techniques in the case of \u00c9tienne-Jules Marey and Eadweard Muybridge, and we have turned these into animations in order to see them in action. In the case of Marey, because these are overexposed photographs that capture movements in action, the result is pretty astounding. \nFor the other filmmakers, we have researched and watched hours of footage from each of them, finding truly extraordinary treasures, and although we have tried to provide a balanced selection of their filmographies, it is impossible to do them complete justice after discovering so much wonderful material.\n\nOnce all the material was selected, we proceeded to subject them to digital restoration and then focused on the design of each edition. \nWe've created an exclusive limited edition reward that includes, besides from the Pioneers Flip Book Collection, a unique print of \u00c9tienne-Jules Marey's backflip jump chronophotography.  This technique was achieved by overlapping celluloid prints one on top of the other, making it possible to discover the different stages of movement, in order to study their relationship to each other in a single image. It is without a doubt one of our favorite images. This reward also includes the full set of AR postcards created exclusively for the campaign.\nFor this campaign we have come up with several appetizing bundles, which may eventually find their way onto your bookshelves.\nBy way of a taster, we\u2019ve created an attractive set of 10 cinematic postcards, one for each filmmaker, perfect for mailing or to be used as bookmarks. Like the flip books, these postcards include the augmented reality feature and each of them will reproduce a micro-documentary with extra information when scanned through the Artivive app on your smartphone or tablet.\nFlipboku is the brainchild of animator and designer Jossie Malis and film music composer Julie Reier. We have both been working in the world of film for many years and love all things related to animation, books and design. We loved the idea of having our own flip book publishing house, so we started the project in 2016 and it has grown steadily since then.\nToday, the Flipboku team is made up of seven members, all working in our design and printing studio Boku Lab in Palma de Mallorca, Spain. The rest of the team consists of the invaluable hands of our two illustrators and graphic designers Noemi Aiolo and Erika Godino, and our irreplaceable production technicians Gustavo Berdayes, Tom\u00e1s Pons and Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Pineda, responsible for the entire production process.\nSince 2019 we have had our own printing workshop where 100% of the production is carried out. This means that the entire production process is under our control, allowing for precise results and finishes, in harmony with our commitment and obsession with design and quality. It took us several years to refine our cinemagic flip books and their optical illusion features, but thanks to the talented hands of our experienced print masters, we were able to fine-tune the concept to perfection.\nHere you can get a glimpse of the super effective teamwork of the Boku crew:\n\nEven though we are already experienced flip book makers, there\u2019s a lot of work that goes into developing an entire collection like The Pioneers. We\u2019ve spent endless time researching, going through hours of film footage while contacting museums, film archives and production companies to find the best material. Then we had to restore and set up each of the 60 sequences and make them suitable for a flip book format.\nNow we need your help to complete the final step \u2013 to bring the flip books to life and get them to the printers. While our print team works on the production, we\u2019ll focus on planning the development and production of the ten micro-documentaries, one for each author.\nTherefore, we\u2019ll need even more footage from archives that needs to be edited and subsequently processed; ten scripts have to be written, voice-over-recorded and mixed, which also applies to the music for each film. Finally, all this content has to be integrated as augmented reality into each flip book.\n\nShipping will be charged AFTER THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN, during the survey stage.\nBelow is an estimate of shipping costs broken down by shipping area. These are only estimates; however we commit to these prices being the maximum amount you will have to pay.\n\nADD ONS:\nAll individual flip books and bundles can be added to your pledge AFTER THE CAMPAIGN and at the same cost. We intentionally chose not to offer Kickstarter add-ons within the campaign to keep the survey process as easy as possible for everyone. Shipping costs for add-ons will be charged by weight; this way we can calculate them as precisely as possible. \n*Shipments for all flip book bundles will include tracking. For the postcards you will be able to choose between tracked and ordinary shipping; the price list shows ordinary shipping rates. The shipping costs are expressed in Euros and US dollars.\nWe are extremely grateful for your support and would love to see you on board!\nSpecial thanks to our friends from Artivive, Caroline Hall, Christel Strobel, Ghent University Museum, Marjan Doom, Biblioth\u00e8que des Archives fran\u00e7aises du film, L\u2019\u0153uvre cin\u00e9matographique des fr\u00e8res Lumi\u00e8re, Filmoteca de Catalunya, Filmoteca Espa\u00f1ola, Internet Archive, Path\u00e9 Archives, Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise, Hartley Moorhouse, Alexander Anderson, Marmoset Music, Tumalo, Beatriz Tejeiro, Jonathan Garc\u00eda, Backercamp,  Daniela Sanchez, ICEX Next, and IEB Institut d'Estudis Balearics.\nThis campaign is promoted by Backercamp.

The design is optimized virtually through our cutting-edge flight path simulator to create the straightest small diameter putter possible within the Professional Disc Golf Association standards, while still offering great grip comfort for both putting and driving.\nDistance in meters\n\n\nThe flight of the Hydrogen is truly unique: Being a very low speed disc, it can hold an anhyzer for any shot between 30 and 90 meters (100 and 300 ft) without neither turning over or flattening out. Likewise, on a hyzer, it will hold the line without flipping up or hyzering additionally. Throw it flat, and watch it go straighter than any other disc you have ever thrown! This is why the disc has the flight characteristics of:\nSPEED: 1       GLIDE: 2\nTURN: 0         FADE 0\nThe exact same properties carry over when putting. With the hydrogen you don\u2019t have to compensate for your putter being too overstable and you don\u2019t have to worry about it flipping over in a headwind putt. Additionally the disc has a rather low glide, ensuring that it will drop to the ground fast in the rare case that you miss the target.\nHydrogen is designed to hold it's line as well as possible within the standards of the PDGA - but not at any cost. Moving the weight of the disc as far away from the middle as possible is one of the ways to make a disc fly straight, so in theory a large diameter disc turns and fades more slowly than a small diameter disc. But we wanted to make sure that the disc made sense to use as a putter, so comfort would always have to be a priority. We wanted to maintain the excellent comfort that small diameter putters have. And on top of that, a small diameter also serves the purpose of lowering wind resistance, lowering glide, and most importantly: Making it easier to hit and stay in the basket! So within this framework, we optimized the straightness of Hydrogen with four key physical features: \nMeasurements in millimeters\nThe flight plate is very thin towards the middle, thickening towards the outer edge of the disc. This moves mass away from the center, and also makes the disc feel a little more shallow near the rim of the disc.\nThe rim is very thin and pretty blunt on the outside, which increases drag (ie. lowering the speed) and decreases the overall pitch moment, which means that no matter if the disc is turning or fading, it is doing it more slowly.\nThe parting line is the line on the outermost edge of the flight plate, which is one of the key parameters to change a disc's stability. This line is placed at the exact spot that gives the most neutral stability possible for the speed Hydrogen is designed to be thrown at, which is rather low speeds. Therefore, you will rarely see this disc fade, unless thrown really nose up. And likewise, you will only see the disc turn when thrown really hard.\nThe flatness and the shoulder profile of the disc ensures low glide. besides making the disc stay in the air longer, glide also makes a disc drift further to the sides when it isn't flying flat, which is very helpfull in some situations, but for the Hydrogen we wanted the disc to push straight forward, even thrown on a bit of anhyzer - or hyzer like you can see in the clip below.\nPLAY\n\nThe disc will be released in two high-end plastic variants. The \u03b1-Solid plastic is our most durable plastic. It offers excellent grip for driving purposes, while having a medium stiffness and a shiny surface finish. The \u03b2-Solid plastic is our putter-optimized plastic. It is relatively stiff, but still with a great grip and a slightly tacky feel. The Beta plastic beats in quicker, allowing you to have various amounts of wear and tear of the same mold.\nOur stamp is based on our logo, which forms the word 'l\u00f8ft' [\u02c8l\u00f8fd] meaning lift or levitate in Danish. Our version of the peculiar letter, \u00d8, that is framing the entire stamp is a recurring reference to our name and to our Danish origins. We deliberately foresee that non-scandinavians will pronounce our name \"loft\", which correlates nicely to the meaning of the word.\nThe box with the disc's name is a reference to the periodic table - also refereing to our scientific approach to disc design. Therefore we used the chemical symbol H for Hydrogen, but instead of keeping the atomic number and weight etc. we used the four conventional flight characteristics; speed (top left), glide (top right), turn (bottom left) and fade (bottom right). \nWe use elements from the periodic table to name all our discs. This has the benefit that discs can be categorized in two axis: Stability and speed. We use the periodic system so you already by hearing the name, can determine whether it is a overstable, understable, high speed or low speed disc. Names for elements with fewer protons in the top of the periodic table are used for low speed discs. Names for elements with fewer valence electrons to the left are generally used for more understable discs. \n\nDisclaimer: Hydrogen is not understable, even though it is to the left in the periodic table. We just only had 2 choices for the lowest speed.\nWe aim for making all discs 174-176 grams, but they will all be more than 172 grams.\nTo make the pricing fair for everyone, shipping is payed individually. We have gathered the best possible shipping prices for a long list of countries of which we expect most rewards, but we ship to anywhere in the world!\n\nWe expect to deliver as soon as April 2021!\n\nIf you ship to outside of European Union, keep in mind that local import fee and taxation may apply. This, however, is not the case in Norway, Iceland, Lichtenstein and Switzerland.\n\nIf you live on an island far from mainland, delivery can take up to 1 month as we may ship by boat. You may therefore receive your reward later that others.\n\nIn very rare cases additional shipping fees may apply for larger orders. This includes orders to The \u00c5land Islands, Svalbard, Corsica, Madeira, The Azores, The Balearics, Canary Islands. But don't worry, we will reach out and find a fair solution.\n\n If you have any other questions regarding shipping, feel free to ask us.\nWe are completely devoted to this project, and every penny leftover from pledges will be reinvested  into making your experience even better. Therefore we commit to following stretch goals if we reach more pledges than our funding goal:\n\nREACHED: \u20ac10,000 - Storage box\nHydrogen comes in a white cardboard storage box with graphics.

But it is far from that. Through half a year of collaboration with Kastaplast on his bachelor's project in mechanical engineering, founder Niels S\u00f8rensen developed the beginning of what today is our flight path simulator. With the assistance of good friend, economist and founder, Asger Sandahl, they succeeded in actually simulating flight paths of discs in 3D. This sparked the idea of using the tool to develop discs, instead of relying solely on assumptions and epxperience. \nSoon the idea of optimizing a putter with regards to flying as straight as possible was born. They joined forces with Kasper Jakobsen, who, with his education in IT and product development and experience in video production seemed like the perfect match.\nSince then, it has been all hard work, and L\u00f8ft Discs is more than ready to present their ideas to the world!\n\n\nL\u00f8ft discs is much more than a kickstarter project. Our vision for the future is to make the highest quality discs for all purposes and push the boundaries for disc golf discs. \n\nNew Molds\nWe have already started the design phase on our next 3 molds launching as soon as we have the resources to do so. The more support we can get through Kickstarter, the quicker the world will see our next discs. \nOnline Flight Path Simulator\nNext year we launch the Beta-version of our 3D flight path simulator for everyone to try out. You will be able to compare every L\u00f8ft disc with the most popular discs on the market. We will over time grow the disc library of the tool, but it can take several days of work to extract data from one single disc.\nTournaments\nwe are commited to grow the sport. Therefore we strive to help organizers make great tournaments, both smaller and bigger ones. We have already co-sponsored two danish tournaments and are planning more for the future. \nMaterial Research\nThe \"Solid\" part of Alpha-Solid and Beta-Solid refers to the relative stiffness of the material. We plan to expand with Alpha-Liquid and Beta-Liquid - Softer and even more grippy variants of the  two plastics, that will also have much less rebounce against trees and other obstacles.  Furthermore, we will start researching for the next generation of plastics: Theta-Solid and Theta-Liquid - Environmental friendly materials that will be bio-based and/or bio-dgradeable, so that we in the future can reduce the environmental footprint of the sport. The name, \"Theta\", is a hint to the Ecology Flag that has the greek letter Theta on it.\nIn 5 years\nWe love disc golf - and we believe that we can help the sport to grow even more. Our hopes and expectations are therefore to be one of the major golf discs producers within the coming 5-8 years. We have so much to offer that the sport haven't seen before and we hope to be able to share our ideas with the amazing disc golf community. We see no limits for neither us or disc golf as a sport - Even though there are only 118 elements in the periodic table ...so far.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs of now (Dec 17) the molding tool still need one iteration including embossment and polishing.

Inside, there's a printed strip of paper with an equal number of images in sequential order. As you spin the zoetrope and look through the slits, they act like a camera shutter, or a strobe, causing the images to flicker and come to life with a phenomenon known as \"persistence of vision.\" The animated strips are easily swapped out for other strips, like going through animated gifs on instagram or twitter.\nIt's the physical interaction of early cinema devices like these, (the analog in a digital world) that makes people smile and connect to them. My artwork ( artnofood.com ) has turned flipbooks into sculptures, brought the mutoscope out of it's clamshell and even added gears to the ph\u00e9nakisticope (hard to say, but oh so much fun to play with). I love it when my work takes a simple gesture, design, or even a story, and presents them in new/old ways. And then I started to look at what I could do with a zoetrope... \nThis lamp is called \"SpermatoZo\u00ebtrope.\" It will also be available in baby blue.\nFor my updated version of the Zo\u00ebtrope I wanted to honor the original concept: a hand powered animation device with changeable art. First I replaced the slits with some invisible tech such as LED's, magnets, custom electronics... That allowed me to put the art on the outside and light the Zo\u00ebtrope from within (lamp). And with more room, came more frames \u2013 hundreds of frames. Now, armed with a larger canvas and more frames, the fun was just starting. \nI soon discovered new ways to create animations that are linear, cyclical, up, down, backwards, forwards, and sometimes all at once. I look at each Zo\u00ebtrope Lamp like a short, recuring film. I have so many ideas that I can't wait to bring to life. All that's needed is a simple twist and suddenly, it\u2019s more than just a beautiful lamp. It\u2019s an animated work of pre-cinema art.\nAnd, while not really needed, I added an umlaut above the \u201ce\u201d in Zo\u00ebtrope. My niece, Zo\u00eb, also has an umlaut.\nWhat will the funding be used for? \nFunds raised will be used to produce all the custom electronics, the tops, the bottoms, the specialty printing, and all the other parts needed to bring these Zo\u00ebtrope Lamps into the world. \nTHE TIMELINE\n September - Launch Kickstarter.\n October - Campaign ends.\n November - Ship Flipbooks. Ship Ph\u00e9nakisticope.\n November - January - Manufacturing, printing, assembling and, packaging of the Zo\u00ebtrope Lamps. \n February - Ship the Zo\u00ebtropes. The spinning begins.\nPlease note: The hope is to ship sooner, and we will if we can. Just wanted to give more time for any possible Covid related delays. \n AND NOW, THE REWARDS: \nThis the ph\u00e9nakisticope in action  \nPLAY\n\n\nI like to use friends as models. That's Kent murdering Annabelle 10 minutes after they met. No worries, she\u2019s fine, the knife was cardboard covered in aluminum foil. Besides, Kent's a really nice guy and wouldn't hurt a fly. Maker's fun fact, I shot my model friends on a green screen so I could change the apartments behind them. But Kent was stabbing so fast it was difficult to silhouette the arm with the knife, and it was my favorite take of the \"murder\" My solution? A mostly green abstract painting on the wall, no need to silhouette.  \nBehold the Spinning Magrittes. That's Cheng by the window and in the sky. George on the bottom and near the roof. And that's me as the littlest Magrittes.\nThis is Sloane Rocking in Slow-Mo. Video by her dad Dan. (Try following one column as it rises.)\n WHY 2 LAMPS?  \nSo you can share the magic that we create together. Most of the work, from editing to the design of the Zo\u00ebtrope Lamp Shade goes into creating the first one. Why should one set of grandparents get a lamp when the other set is just as worthy? \nPongo thinks this is a great idea. FYI: There is over 201 Dalmatians on this lamp.\n\nMAGNET POWER!!! (A goal of $25,000)\nIn keeping with the original hand spun way of the Zo\u00ebtrope, I chose not to motorize this lamp*. The thought was to keep it simple and not have a constantly animated object. To create a cool object with a secret. By spinning it with your hand, you become a part of the action, as it becomes an \"event\" rather than a constant display of animation.\nWith a good spin, the Zo\u00ebtrope lamp can spin for several minutes until it stops and becomes a just a good looking lamp again. I want to add a magnetic assist that would keep it spinning for up to 10 minutes with just a slight twist of the lamp.\n*In the future, as I make larger Zo\u00ebtropes, I will be adding motors and/or hand cranked gears.\nPrototypes, experiments, behind the scenes\nthe abduction cow during a break in filming\nWhile it's nessecerry to show how my Zo\u00ebtropes Lamps spin in real life. Filming them creates rolling black bars and excessive flickering. It's an issue with syncing the Zo\u00ebtrope \"shutter speed\" to the camera film speed. So, I tried stop motion animation to film some tests. I turned each lamp 24x while stopping to take a photo at every 15 degree turn. \nHere are some tests, they are not for sale yet. I would need a license to sell these.  But, I look forward to talking to the fine folks at Disney, Pokemon, Warner, Sony, NFL, NBA, MLB, MTV, the Olympics. Reach out to hear more about ideas for content, how to bring them to life and would love to talk to someone about a license deal or two.\nPLAY\n\nHere's a Bruce Lee test. I called it Many Chucks\nThis is what what Mr Lee looks like when this is animated.\n\nThis is animation from a test I call Kane Klaps", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAfter all the time and effort spent on these lamps, I hope people get as much joy out of them as I put into them. If the Zo\u00ebtrope Lamp is a success, I\u2019m excited to face the challenges of meeting that success. I look forward to getting these out into the world as quickly as possible. \n\nCovid? Since lockdown has affected everything from manufacturing to shipping, a little more time has been added to the delivery date than would have been BC (before covid).

We didn't just design it to move flexibly, we designed it to be used anywhere. It's dressy enough for work but comfortable enough for travel or play.  \nFlexible/Comfortable Sole\nWe work and live on our feet. Even working at stand-up desks makes us more aware of our feet than ever. But not everyone can wear sneakers to the office. So we thought, what if we make a work shoe that was designed for the type of work we do. So we made a list. It had to be: \nLIGHTWEIGHT\nBREATHABLE\nMACHINE WASHABLE\nand above all else\nCOMFORTABLE\nAnd while we were at it, we thought we'd try to make a shoe that would be good for the Earth too. \nInterested? \nBreathable\nYour beautiful leather shoes don't breathe, \nand that STINKS (literally). \nThe key to cool feet that don't stink are shoes that breathe. We designed the SUMMIT SHOES with a high-performance breathable mesh fabric. In fact, our whole clothing line is based on a stretchy, breathable fabric with a SECRET. \n OUR SECRET: Water bottles. \nYup, tons of water bottles. Americans use roughly 50 BILLION water bottles every year and only recycle about 23%. We want to make something that's not just useful, but AMAZING out of that recycled plastic.  \nOxford Wingtip Design (to look like a dress shoe!)\n WASH THIS WAY\nToss 'em in the wash. Can your leather oxfords say that?   \nMachine Washable\n Our wingtips will make you FLY!\nWe designed our SUMMIT SHOES with an oxford wingtip design. In a leather shoe, those holes are dead ends, but in our shoes, they are ventilated windows. Our lightweight shoes are lighter than leather and more breathable than wool. We are releasing our first shoes in the most needed colors for work: black and brown.\nUltra-lightweight\n  We KNOW where you walked last summer. \nYou may forget about comfort for a few steps when you are trying on shoes, but we don't. And your feet never forget an uncomfortable shoe. That's why we use customized memory foam insoles that make the SUMMIT SHOES comfier than your mattress. Trust us, your feet will thank you. \nComfort of a running shoe\n Do you know what else is a pain? \nUntying your shoes at the end of the day is a real downer. Our stretchy shoes can be pulled on and off. We started as a shirt company, but our stretchy shoe collars stay true to our &Collar name. \nStretch Collar\nYup, we thought of everything. \nThe perfect shoe for work and for play.  We just need your help to make it a reality.  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGood news! Our first 1000 pairs are already manufactured and arriving to our warehouse here in the United States the week after launching this campaign. Those are ready to be shipped out, so don't wait on them. \n\nAs for the rest of the shoes, we know that there are sometimes circumstances out of our control (ie COVID-19), but we have proven that we can move beyond those by successfully fulfilling all orders on three past Kickstarter campaigns as well as over 5000+ orders and 30,000+ items since we've started.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nWe have designed our products to last years by using sustainable, high-quality materials. We pay approximately 25% more than we would otherwise to use sustainable materials that we know are of the highest quality. If a product breaks down, we as a company take it back, inspect it, and then repurpose and reuse it.\nReusability and recyclability\nPackaging to date has been 100% recyclable, recycled, and reusable. We are working on making all future materials and packaging to be compostable as well!\nSustainable materials\nWe are using recycled plastic bottles to create the threads/materials we are using in the uppers of our shoes. This is in line with the 15-20 plastic bottles we use in all of our products that we previously launched on Kickstarter and that we are continuing to sell today on our website.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nAll of our factories are certified by various independent third-party groups.

Lose the weight of your thick wallet but never compromise on performance. With a few specialized pockets and cutting-edge technology, you have everything you need and more.   \nYou\u2019ve been telling us what you want, and our development team has been working hard every day to make it real. And now we bring you Blaze Wallet evolved form, the Strapo Wallet. With it, our new company name, Valmor Design.\nWith The Blaze Wallet, We Invite You To Be A Part Of Our Story Again\nThe story of the Blaze Wallet is a story of doing more with less -- of having a wallet that is sleek and thin but does just as much or more than a regular wallet.\nOur designers have pulled out all the stops to create something we dare to call revolutionary in wallet design.\nGone are the days where you have to carry around a thick, fat brick of a wallet that bulges and makes you \u201csit crooked\u201d all day.\nAlso gone are the days when a minimalist wallet is nothing more than a glorified money clip. We\u2019ve invented a wallet that truly does allow you to do more with less.\nWalk away from tradition and join the Valmor Design movement with your Blaze Wallet today!\nCrafted from classic top-grain leather that will patina beautifully -- each crease, nick, and mark burnishing it with one-of-a-kind highlights showing every step of your journey.\nCrafted from premium top-grain leather that will patina beautifully\n2 cards in front pockets\nCentral pocket that holds 3-4 cards, which is RFID protected\nPull tab strap to easily access cards\nHighly durable elastic band stores up to 3-4 cards\nDrop-free coin pocket\nLanyard loop/keyring attachment\nGPS tracker pocket\nBuilt-in NFC\nRFID protection\nWork ID or transit card easy scanning slot\nSlim, low-profile design\nEco-friendly packaging\nDavid vs Goliaths\nThe day was October 4th, 2017 - the evening before our first Kickstarter launch. We were done with all the work leading up to this big moment\u2026 and we were all super NERVOUS.\nAt that time we were going up against some of the biggest names in wallet design with huge corporate backing. From all appearances, we didn\u2019t stand a chance of becoming successful.\nOur Miracle -- The Underdogs\u2019 Comeback\nTowards the end of October, something amazing started to happen. Our Kickstarter got picked up by one big media outlet, and then we got picked up by another, and then another. Lifehacker, Kotaku, Gizmodo, and many more!\nBy the end of our campaign, we were over 7,000% funded. We had a big celebration the night after our Kickstarter.\nAnd all throughout 2018, while we were fulfilling orders -- emails were pouring in from people about the direction we should go next. Along the way, we learned some very important lessons.\n How we created Blaze Wallet \n Founded on a Dream and Passion alone \nIn the past 2 years, our company has been growing immensely and we were able to ship to 65 Countries. With the STRAPO wallet, it was always our mission to revolutionize ordinary purchases by providing extraordinary value.\nIn the midst of evolving our company, we wanted a name that clearly communicates our brand values. That\u2019s the reason why we chose the name VALMOR DESIGN for ourselves. It combines the words \u201cValue\u201d and \u201cMore\u201d and represents the marriage of so-called \u201cordinary\u201d products with a new standard of practical usefulness.\nIf you rewind our story all the way to the beginning, you\u2019ll see us making our first wallet prototypes out of duct tape. \nShipping: We are ready for production, As planned our first batch rewards will be shipped by the end of May 2020. We will ship V3 Minimalist Wallet to our backers worldwide. The shipping cost varies base on your location. You can find out the shipping cost in each pledge. However, there may be additional duties and taxes you might have to pay. In any case, we recommend checking your country\u2019s tax and customs laws. If we reship your package, the backer has to pay for the new shipping.\nReturn/Refund: While all of our products have a 1-year warranty, we do not offer refunds, returns, or exchanges on items received as Kickstarter rewards. The support we get from our Kickstarter backers is what enables us to run and grow our business, gather customer feedback, design new products and improve existing ones. In the Kickstarter community, the items that you receive after making a pledge are referred to as \"rewards\" because they are not purchases in the traditional sense. Think of rewards as gifts.\nWHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET\nAs a small business, it\u2019s often very difficult to secure enough capital for larger projects, especially one that requires such quality materials and craftsmanship. We\u2019ve turned to crowdfunding to help keep costs as low as possible, removing the strain of investor returns which would send the cost of the product higher. Once our funding goal is reached, we will be able to carry out our first production run, fulfilling the preorders made here. Please see our reward tier to secure yours today. It would also make a wonderful gift.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFrom the experience of our previous project, we learned throughout this process. Learned from our mistake, now we know how to build quality products and deliver on time.\n\nDelays and unforeseen obstacles are an inevitable part of product development. Fortunately, most of the process is already complete. \n\nWe created multiple prototypes, tested for quality and durability. we have received production-ready prototypes that were made by the actual manufacturers that will be producing the final goods, so the processes and tooling used for production have been completely worked out. our final design is ready to start manufacturing. We learned a lot during our prototype phase, We\u2019ve got a lot of the hard work done, \n\nSupport us by backing this project and sharing on social media is equally important. Back us now.

The story follows Marie, a young woman who uses her secret passion for taxidermy to cope with debilitating anxiety.  \n Not just any anxiety--but the kind that can really knock you flat. In portraying characters with these issues, we are hoping to reduce the stigma around mental health and get people thinking and talking more about it. To start some conversations. We are also aiming to use the musical elements of the show to help us all better understand what it's like to live with anxiety. We have done our best to be careful in doing so--consulting with two fantastic therapists: Tony Overbay (check out his podcast \"The Virtual Couch\") and Paul Peterson.\n And not just any taxidermy--but an art form that uses only found animals (the kind you find on the side of the road) and antiques (the kind you find at a garage sale). If you're curiosity is piqued, Google \"Rogue Taxidermy.\" It's a whole artistic movement we stumbled upon last fall. We've since collaborated and consulted with two artists, Hollie Dilley & Jillian Abernathy, for two commissioned pieces for the pilot episode. \n*No squirrels were harmed in the making of this pilot.\n**But two were scavenged off the highway. \nThrough the combined efforts of an incredible team (see list below), plus some extra help from friends and family, we wrapped production of the twenty-minute pilot episode on September 20. The footage looks incredible, the three studio recorded songs sound amazing, but we need your help to finish things up and spread the word! \n Our goal with this Kickstarter campaign is to cover:\n $1500 in construction materials \n$2500 to cover post-production costs--everything that will make the final film look and sound amazing\n$500 to cover the rewards \nAnything beyond that will go towards festival submissions & additional recording for the score. \n Long term, our goal is to build an audience & support system that will allow us to carry the story beyond the initial pilot episode. \nTHANK YOU for contributing to The Anxious Taxidermist in whatever way you can! Every dollar & every share not only helps, but means the world to us.\nMuch Love,\nJeff & Aurora \n ***Note: If you're as excited about The Anxious Taxidermist as we are, & want to contribute more to the success of the project, please contact us directly so that we can discuss an executive producer situation.***\nTHE TEAM\nThe Anxious Taxidermist is a collaborative effort with a long, and not wholly comprehensive list of stellar people, in no particular order: Katie Schwarz (producer), Jeff Dickamore (director/writer), Aurora Florence (music/writer), Jake Schwarz (DP), Kendra Lowe (music producer), Garret Breeze (orchestrations), Becky Swasey (hair/makeup), Whitney Donald (production design), Mary Lee (art/props), Matt Siemers (1st AD), Alan Seawright (2nd AD), Kade Atwood (Production), Karina Orton (design assistant), Jameson Dressen (1st AC), Stephanie Bogdan (2nd AC), Michael Stone (DIT), Jared Jaynes (Sound), Merik Richardson (gaffer), Jack Lott (grip), Mariah Johnson (grip), Ben Johns (grip), Michael Frazier (Set Cosntruction), Matthew Buckner (construction assist.), Katy Baldwin (Set Decorator), Anna Hawkins (Costumer), LaRee Florence (taxidermy costumer), Truman Florence (BTS, Set Decorator), Brittany Butler (BTS), & last but not least, Alexia Meyer (choreographer).

The devices were initially created in Guatemala City using an artisanal, piecewise process. The radios themselves were purchased from a third party and I personally made all the somewhat rustic looking avocado shells. The guac-e\u2019s in the photos serve as proof of concept - what\u2019s clumsy and rustic-looking now needs some hard work and what comes out is an elegant walkie-talkie.\nThe Guac-e Talk-e Walkie-Talkie\nPLAY\n\nMerch\nguac pins!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe human capacity is boundless, a group working in concert to meet those needs is made up of individuals each doing their part to achieve that common goal.

If you haven't seen it yet, please stop and watch our first Kickstarter below, before continuing:\nOk, so what's happened since then?    \nWe used the providential resources from our first Kickstarter ($171K+$50K raised outside Kickstarter) to over deliver on our campaign promises. In less than 2 months, we assembled an all-star cast and crew, including actors Ben Cross (Star Trek), Eugene Brave Rock (Wonder Woman), and Karina Lombard (Legends of The Fall). \nName actors weren't expected or promised at our budget level but we went ahead and got them anyways (fist pump). \nIt was a collaborative effort involving many different creeds, ideologies, and talents coming together to make an EPIC concept short film that will change the world and the face of cinema. Now, I\u2019m Mormon and I love Mormons, but for the skeptics who think this is just a Mormon film, it may interest you to know... \n90% of our cast and crew were NOT Mormon.\nWe completed post production on our concept film in record time (a month early, in fact!) and premiered it on March 15, 2018. Over 700 people attended. Check out the audience reactions from our first premiere:\nLos Angeles was next at the iconic Fox Village Theatre April 12th 2018 for another 700 people.\nThe response from our first two premieres was so tremendous it inspired us to a bold, first-ever (by demand) worldwide theatrical exhibition of a concept short film:\nSo, what happened next?     \nWell... \nWe sold nearly 10,000 tickets worldwide (most at $12 USD/each) in 34 U.S. States and 4 different countries. \nWith 425 ratings in three months, our concept short film has...\nRead IMDb Reviews\n80% of all our ratings are a full 10 stars.\nFor comparison, the top-rated full length films on IMDb rank at 9.2 Stars. \nSee full list\nHere are some of our favorite reviews: \n\"A worldwide phenomenon in the making! The impeccable music score combined with stunning sweeping visuals moves you emotionally from the first moments of the film.\"\n- Jessie P., IMDb\n\"The (Braveheart) spirit of freedom has been captured again.\"\n- Kim B., IMDb\n\"Ben Cross' performance was spine-tingling powerful... grabbed me by the throat!\"\n- Don L., IMDb\n\"I'm not Mormon but I love their literature & would be so excited to see (the full feature) when it reaches fruition.\"\n- Gizmo F., Facebook\n\"This movie touched me deeply and emotionally... tears streaming down my face.

Can you imagine how much you'll treasure a Limited First Edition copy of our breakout concept short film and behind the scenes when our FULL feature hits theaters worldwide as a blockbuster hit? \nUnlike HD Downloads, which tend to collect virtual dust in cyberspace, these Limited Edition Blu-ray/DVD combos are great tangible GIFTS. There's no better way to introduce this EPIC Book of Mormon war story to friends than with a riveting visual spectacle, action-packed and gripping, which instantly captivates even the most skeptical viewer. \nOur preferred media company (which does all the big Hollywood shows) can create 5,000 Limited First Edition Blu-ray/DVD combos uniquely numbered in order of purchase for $15,000. This is our base goal.   \nBut... our real goal is to pre-sell, right here on Kickstarter, 100,000 or more Blu-ray/DVD combos. \nNow, let's pause here for a moment. \nThe entire purpose for which our initial 1,601 backers funded our concept short film was to inspire the funds for our FULL feature. \n100,000 Blu-ray/DVD combos sold represents over $1M toward our FULL feature and it could realistically propel us into full funding! And what if we sold 200K copies ($3M toward our full feature funding)? Or 300K copies ($4M toward our full feature funding). Now, it's far from likely we'll sell 2M Blu-ray/DVD combos here on Kickstarter and hit the $40M needed for full feature funding, BUT, can you see-- with your support-- how our concept short film can quite literally fulfill its intended purpose in a way none of us may have ever imagined?\nLet me tell you why this matters and just how critical your support is right now. \nWe've worked night and day, since our first campaign funded, hiring the right people, coordinating volunteers, reinvesting every dollar to keep our momentum healthy and we still have a long ways to go. I have not paid myself a salary since we began this wild ride. So, if you're wondering, rest assured, I'm in the trenches right beside you.\nTypically, money raised privately for major films cannot be accessed until the full budget is obtained.  \nBut we need funds right now to hire additional writers and producers necessary to ready our full feature for production.  \nAt minimum, this Kickstarter will give us critical resources we can use immediately for these and other needs.  \nI'm going to open the hood right now and tell you something that, I hope with all my heart, will make you stand on your feet and join me.\n1,601 backers funded our concept film to inspire the funds for our FULL feature and, guess what-- It worked!! Yes, you heard that right, it worked. We have a small studio anxiously waiting to fund our full feature in 60-90 days. There's just one caveat. They require full creative control.\nWhat's creative control?\nIn movies, it's the authority to decide the final cut of the film. Whoever has creative control decides all content that makes it into the final edit. For our concept short film, we shot over 6 pages of action in a day and a half! The pace and energy with which we executed all decisions during production would NOT have been possible had we not had full creative discretion. \nIf Reign of Judges: Title of Liberty was just a film I invented in my head, I would've signed over creative control, collected a nice check, and moved on to my next film. I'm not so married to myself that I couldn't give up my life's work if it meant it was going to reach the world-- and this film isn't the only film I'm ever going to make. The fact is, this project isn't my \"baby\", it's God's. And I have a responsibility to make sure it's done right-- to honor the record it comes from while reaching the largest mainstream audience possible.\nI've been at this long enough to know there's only two ways a film gets made. \nPrivate money or studio money; sometimes a combination of both, but whenever a studio funds a project they require creative control.  \nWith your generous pledge today, our FULL feature WILL be made and it will be one of the greatest epics this world has ever seen-- a film you and I, TOGETHER, will make. A film you and I, TOGETHER, can be proud of.  \nWe can either sit back and watch Hollywood feed us whatever films they want or we can unite behind a powerful film that has every potential to be one of the greats.\nStand with me and help us make the first North American war epic set in the pre-Columbian New World. Make your pledge now. Make history.\nSincerely,\nDarin Southam\nWriter/Director \nFACEBOOK | INSTAGRAM | TWITTER | YOUTUBE\nJOIN OUR EMAIL LIST\nORIGINAL KICKSTARTER VIDEO MUSIC BY: Greg Dombrowski \"Before Time\"\nENDORSEMENTS\nBEN CROSS on IMDb\nKIETH MERRILL on IMDb\nDAVID ATHERTON on IMDb \n CLIFTON CHIPPEWA on IMDb\nPAMELA CONN on IMDb \n PHILIP NIU on IMDb\nWe have ONE paramount goal with this campaign: \n1. RAISE $1,000,000 OR MORE IN PLEDGES BEFORE AUG. 18TH (both in and outside of Kickstarter) through Blu-ray/DVD combo sales and other rewards offered. If we reach this goal, there's a 99% chance it will propel us into production on our FULL feature THIS YEAR. How? \nWith tax incentives and foreign distribution commitments we can likely make our $40M film raising just $5-$8M privately. \n$1M puts us closer than you think!! Every Kickstarter reward offered is a vehicle to help us reach full feature funding. Believe me, we know $1M is lofty, BUT reaching it will allow us to make some critical hires NOW, instead of waiting till the full budget is reached. It will also prevent discouraging and costly delays to our full feature. So, there is much at stake.\nThe average budget for period-action war epics is $100-150M. Our budget at $40M is actually extremely low. Shooting 6 pages of action in a day and a half for our concept short film should engender confidence we can keep costs down but real Hollywood professionals aren't cheap. Writers with bankable credits charge between $150-$500K+ for feature writing. Producers charge even more. We have a 115-page budget that shows exactly where all production money goes but it's not something we can post publicly.\nTo be candid, I'm championing this movement full-time, reinvesting all profits toward our full feature and taking no salary, but it has (in all sincerity) reached the point this film needs to be my only focus. This means we need development funds (from this Kickstarter) to also allow me to start paying myself :).\nFinally, here are some other costs we need to cover from our Kickstarter funds. Prepare yourself, it's pretty boring (and a little disheartening) but very important.\nWe don't get to keep all the money we raise on Kickstarter.\nLet me break it down:\nCAMPAIGN FEES: Kickstarter's fees, together with the credit card processing fees, come to about 8.5%. At our goal of $1M that's $85K! \nREWARDS & FULFILLMENT: We have to design, print, organize, and pay for rewards to be shipped. This includes paying someone else to fulfill the orders (so we can be off making the film you've helped us fund). That's why we appreciate you paying the extra shipping cost. That said, Kickstarter charges their fee on shipping costs too :(. So we're charged the fee on shipping costs even though we have to use those costs for, you know, shipping. Go figure. Total order fulfillment costs come to roughly 25%. At $1M raised, we'll get discounted bulk rates, but its still about $200,000. \n\"DEATH AND TAXES\": Kickstarter funds are taxable. Unfortunately, we do have to plan for the worst and the tax gorilla still remains at about 15-18%. At $1M raised that's $165K-- yikes! Believe me, we\u2019re pulling out all the stops to keep tax liability low but we\u2019re also above board around here so everything's gonna be legal.\nDEVELOPMENT COSTS: As mentioned, hiring bankable writers and producers could cost upwards of $300,000+. Of course, we'll work our magic to keep costs down. We have a great track record so far, getting 3 name actors on our concept short film :)!\nWE ARE NOT A CHARITY. We've tried hard to give you awesome reward choices.  \nWe\u2019ve tried to give you as much reward value as possible while also considering that Kickstarter order fulfillment can be a nightmare. Of course, we have systems in place to fulfill all orders like champs (and we WILL just like we did in our first campaign), but it should be mentioned, several notable Kickstarter campaigns, including some of the highest-funded, have been unable to fulfill their orders. Yikes!\nWe will NOT be one of those campaigns. Ever.\nBut we are also not store owners\u2014we\u2019re filmmakers. We want to use your hard-earned pledge funds to make an amazing film short we can all be proud of.\nSo, have fun choosing, and above all, we\u2019re grateful for your support in making the loudest statement you can. Remember, Kickstarter only allows you to pledge once-- so make it count! You can also increase your pledge any time before the campaign ends, as well as in your exit survey.  \nPLEASE NOTE: ALL DIGITAL REWARDS WILL BE DELIVERED WITHIN 3-5 BUSINESS DAYS OF OUR CAMPAIGN SUCCESSFULLY CLOSING.\nOur featured product is a LIMITED EDITION Blu-ray/DVD combo of our concept short film and behind the scenes. 24 minutes of EPIC content. We have 3 categories. Limited Edition numbered 2-100 ($30) (SOLD OUT!), Limited Edition numbered 101-1K ($20), and Limited Edition numbered 1,001-5K ($18). We also have REGULAR EDITIONS for $15. Our 10, 20, 50, & 100 packs are REGULAR Editions. HD Downloads are included with ALL Blu-ray/DVD combos, however, with bulk packs, only ONE HD Download will be issued to the purchaser of the pack. The package design isn't quite finished but it will look something like this:\nWe're still working on the design for our new shirt as well but it will have the imagery from our poster and Blu-ray/DVD combo packs. Here are the other T-Shirts, back by popular demand: \nAnd here is our vintage style T-Shirt from our initial launch four years ago today, also back by popular demand at a much lower pledge point than our first campaign! \nOur NEW design will also be White on Black. We may also do a Black on White option if we have enough demand. \nHere is our Key Chain with Moroni's Medallion Image, limited supply left from our first Kickstarter:\nFinally, our stunning new poster, shot and designed by Chad Keyes. This is the first time we've made these available outside of our premieres so grab as many as you can. Save when you buy 5 or 10 at a time. Pay a little more and have them signed as well! Check it out, full size, glossy and beautiful 27\"x40\". \nNext is our cover art for our mp3 original concept short score download. Kyle Warr is Thomas Newman meets Hans Zimmer. Have a listen and see why people are raving about our concept short score.\nLast but not least by a long shot, Associate and Executive Producer credits are honorary designations, which do not entail filmmaking but we are happy to talk movies and show you around the business if you're unfamiliar and have an inkling. These producer rewards do require that we complete our full feature, which, until this campaign blows up :), is still uncertain. When we produce the feature, you're name will be on the credits! You'll also be on a cell phone bases with our producing team and you'll get to meet and mingle with movie stars-- more than you already do I mean :). \n Obviously we want to get green lit on our full feature ASAP but our timeline, as of now is, end of 2018 or beginning of 2019 we would like to be in production so we can release next Christmas. This is why our Kickstarter campaign is so critical. The funds we raise here will speed things up dramatically. If we all come together, this campaign will be a game-changer for our funding.  \nWe came in ahead of schedule on the timeline from our last campaign, so, you're support is in good hands.\nCheck out some amazing facts about The Book of Mormon on our BOOK OF MORMON SHOWSTOPPERS LIST:\nI know what you\u2019re thinking-- After reading this list, can you believe Reign of Judges: Title of Liberty stands to be the first Book of Mormon war epic ever made??", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe purpose of this Kickstarter is to fund our full feature in whole or in part through the creation and sales of Blu-ray/DVD combos. If we meet our goal, Blu-ray/DVD combos will be created, per the pledges made. We also have a track record of delivering on our campaign promises. We mentioned in our last Kickstarter that we could not control how our concept short film was received but we could control it's quality. We have delivered a product of substantial quality that has garnered exceptionally positive reviews. This also minimizes your risk. \n\nThat said, this film project has the same risks as any other TV/Film project. Particularly, at this stage, there is a risk the full feature will never be made do to lack of funding. In such a case, all respective rewards tied to the completion of the full feature (Executive and Associate Producer credits, for example) will not be able to be delivered. In such cases, by pledging to this campaign, you are agreeing to consider those pledges a donation in the event we are unable to fund our full feature.\n\nIf we reach our goal, with the exception of rare extenuating and unforeseen circumstances, we GUARANTEE the fulfillment of all rewards not tied to the completion of our full feature within no more than 3 months from successful campaign close. We have already made a powerful and epic concept short film which has been received tremendously well. We partnered with the best talent in the industry to ensure our concept short film meets the absolute highest production standards and it definitely paid off.\n\nWe promise to our supporters to pour every bit of passion we have into this undertaking (just like we have done and demonstrated thus far). At the end of the day, if it isn't enough, the chips will fall where they may. This much we can tell you: The louder the statement our supporters make through this campaign the easier our job becomes.\n\nThe writer/creator of this project, Darin Southam, has written and directed over 30 successful film projects. He's never gone over budget and has always met his deadlines. Consequently, he also completed the concept short film for Reign of Judges early and under budget.\n\nOur ongoing commitment is this: we will, in good faith, advocate the production of our full feature until it is produced and made available with an intended worldwide theatrical release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "THANK YOU", "descp": "Don't have a lot to give?

I have ordered the Limited Edition short film and am very much looking forward to seeing it. I wasn't able to make it to theaters to see it as it was never in my area of Ogden, Utah. I am sharing this with friends and family on Facebook and with personal messages to them via email, FB Messenger, and Instagram Messenger. I am praying that this film gets made and am tracking the progress on this campaign daily (at least). One additional suggestion that I have for you is that you make this campaign the \"Own The Short Film Concept\" campaign, but that you then launch a 3rd campaign for \"Funding the Full Feature Length Film\" once more people have had the chance to see the film and get excited. Or, if this is truly going to be your last campaign then release a free viewing for those who have already backed this campaign or the previous campaign so far so that we can finally see the short film and get even more excited! Another idea is to somehow in someway give the opportunity to folks to rent the film (even if they haven't backed either campaign yet) and view it as many times as they like for 24 hours once they push play and be able to share this with those family/friends in their home at the time.

This premium paper is the perfect size and thickness for smooth flipping. It is also acid free which means it will not yellow with time. \n Bind your flipbook together with the included easy-to-use, reusable binding screws. Like the paper, each kit includes enough binding screws to make 4 flipbooks or 2 XL size flipbooks. You will love these things!\nTriple your paper quantity by adding the 8X Paper Pack! If you're anything like me, you'll want to make LOTS of flipbooks, and that's why we've created the add-on 8X Paper Pack, which comes with enough extra paper & binding screws to make 8 additional flipbooks or 4 more XL flipbooks.\nTo add a printed copy of my \"Cloudy with a Chance of Extinction\" flipbook to any other pledge level, simply increase your total pledge by $6.\nEasy! Follow my YouTube tutorials to learn at any skill level. I share flipbook videos and have many more tutorials on the way.\nHere is our manufacturing schedule and what to expect once the campaign ends. We have several years of manufacturing experience and handling all of the logistics involved. This timeline is our best estimate but as with any Kickstarter project, it may be subject to change.\nWe will always be transparent about our manufacturing and fulfillment processes. As a backer you will have an inside look of each step along the way. We are committed to delivering rewards as quickly as possible! \nThis project is EU, AU, CA and US friendly, which means that VAT and GST fees are prepaid for all backers in each of those regions! Backers in those regions will pay no extra customs fees or duties at the time of delivery. We have selected reputable logistics partners around the world to ensure reliable reward delivery.\nBecause the shipping weight of each pledge level is quite heavy, we have taken great care to calculate accurate shipping fees specific to each country. We make no profit on any of these shipping costs. \nYour pledges through Kickstarter make this kit a reality.

While there are always risks, challenges and unexpected hurdles, this project is significantly less complicated than our previous project, and we can't wait to get into production!\n\nThe estimated delivery date is November 2018.

Two years ago, we came up with an idea about how to create a new kind of flip book. We wanted to upgrade the classic format and bring it to a whole new level, and this is the result:\nMolecularis is also an animated coloring book. You can use it in plenty of ways, by coloring, redrawing and varying its content with an endless number of possibilities. Use pencils, markers, watercolors, graphite, brushes, technical pens or whatever technique you prefer. \nBy alternating the colors gradually from one picture to the next and using your favorite color palette, you can not only give the sequences their very own personality, but also bring them to life \u2013 as you see them \u2018move\u2019 when you flip through the pages.\nInside Molecularis, you\u2019ll find a group of small and restless organisms that interact with each other as if they were being observed through a microscope.\nLike all flip books, Molecularis relies on the principle of persistence of vision, which in other words, is exactly what your eyes and brain do when you watch a movie. In a flip book, every picture varies gradually from one page to the next, so by flipping the pages with your thumb, they generate the illusion of movement. This simple technique has been around since 1868 and played an important role in the birth of cinema.\nBecause the sequences are loop animated, after coloring or redrawing, you can create GIFs like this!\nThe sequences were designed and animated by Jossie Malis, co-founder of Flipboku and best known for his award-winning animated series Bendito Machine. Maybe you've come across this video from the first flip book we created for the show a couple of years ago. Find out more here.\n                         If you observe the flip book in closer detail, you will notice that the edges are cut in a specific way, so that you can swap between the different sequences. This is the key to the optical illusion that gives Molecularis its unique feature of showing you six different animations in just one flip book. You'll have a blast watching people's faces when they see Molecularis for the first time and try to understand how it works! :D\nAnd here's the secret: it all depends on the position of your thumb. You can switch between sequences by placing your thumb either in the upper corner, the center or the lower corner of the front edge of the book.\nAs there are 3 sequences on each side of the book, the images are arranged alternately. This means that you will have sequences 1, 2 and 3 on one side and 4, 5 and 6 when you turn the book around. To proceed with the coloring simply follow each sequence by jumping every 3 pages. You will have better control of the coloring process if you follow each animated element in every sequence. \nEvery single Molecularis is largely hand-produced and the whole process requires a number of steps that rely on careful supervision. We spent a lot of time testing different paper qualities and consulted with several experts until we found the perfect match: high quality 100% recycled heavy paper with a semi-rough surface and a nice smooth finish. It's suitable for all kinds of different techniques and prevents colors from passing through it. Each Molecularis comes with 180 pages (90 sheets). \n We have a weakness for good packaging, and that\u2019s why we included a sleek slip case to keep your Molecularis safe after you use it. It prevents the pages from wearing out and by the way, it looks awesome on your shelf or wherever you want to keep it.\nAs a perfect complement to Molecularis we have created a learning flip book for anyone who wants to try \u2018freestyle\u2019 animation::  \nBlanko is a flip book that contains 320 blank pages on which you can animate whatever comes to your mind. If you're new to animation, learn how to get started with 6 of the basic principles we have included: squash and stretch, anticipation, ease in - ease out, arcs, timing and exaggeration. You can use both sides of the flip book.\nWatch this terrific animation by our good friend Nacho Rodr\u00edguez created on Blanko, featuring his character Mr. Coo:\nPLAY\n\nMolecularis and Blanko make a great couple, that's why we have bundled them up in a practical and sleek protective sleeve. You can also choose between several combinations:\nWe have partnered with Winsor&Newton, leading Brithish color-maker for more than 180 years, to create an awesome limited edition reward that includes a set of 12 assorted Watercolor Markers. This is a top quality marker set that will suit either the casual artist or the professional.\nEach pen has a fine point tip on one end and a flexible brush tip on the other end. The colors are bright, lightfast and highly pigmented and they're designed to make gorgeous washes when combined with water. Because they have dual nibs, you can also use them for fine detail and sweeping line thicknesses. You won't find another marker quite like these ones.\nNEW REWARD UPDATE!\nMany of you asked us for more Winsor & Newton sets so we just unlocked a new limited edition reward! Those of you who have tried the Cotman Water Colours will agree with us, they are simply the best. Inside of this set you\u2019ll find 12 high-quality, vibrant Cotman colours, an ergonomically designed brush pen with its own water reservoir and a mixing palette inside the lid. All packed into a slim, beautifully curved case that fits in your pocket, together with your Molecularis and/or Blanko. \nDespite its small size, a lot of work goes into creating a flip book like Molecularis. We've spent hours and hours on the design board, working hand in hand with our local printing house, cutting, binding and testing to achieve this result. Printing projects such as this one are only cost effective if you reach a certain quantity threshold, which is why we need your help to complete the final step \u2013 to finally bring the flip book to life and get it into the printers.\nFlipboku is a project which comes straight from the hearts of animator and designer Jossie Malis and music composer Julie Reier. We love animation, design and flip books and we are thrilled at the idea of creating something you can manipulate with your hands, without any need for cables or batteries, just by using your thumb! \nBased on the Mediterranean island of Mallorca, Spain, Flipboku is meant to grow slowly as a side project, while we continue making films and sounds in our studio, Zumbakamera. The team is completed with the invaluable hands of illustrator, designer and official coloring artist Noemi Aiolo, and in the near future, with the collaboration of independent animators from planet earth.\n                                                       We are extremely grateful for your support and would love to see you on board.\nThis campaign is promoted by Backercamp. Since 2012, Backercamp has helped over 5,000 creators make their projects a reality.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have over 15 years of experience in the fields of animation, design, and printing. Developing Molecularis has been a great challenge, but after a few years perfecting the technique in close collaboration with our printing house we can say that every aspect of the production process is perfectly solved. Everything is ready to go into production once the campaign is over. We have also included a buffer in our timeline to allow for delays and to deliver on time.

Diving compressed air can be very dangerous and always a good idea to be certified for your own safety.\nNever ascend to the surface without releasing air from your lungs to avoid Over Lung Expansion \nPulmonary Barotrauma: During rapid ascent the air in the lungs expand, causing lung over expansion and rupture releasing bubbles into the bloodstream.\nIf you are not a certified diver: Practice in a pool until you get comfortable with breathing underwater \"it is a mental training\" to avoid underwater panick\nNever Dive Alone: safety procedures that are intended to improve divers' chances of avoiding or surviving accidents in or under water by diving in a group of two\nWater Pressure Compresses Air: Air in a diver's body air spaces and dive gear will compress as pressure increases (and expand as pressure decreases). PRESSURE AFFECTS MANY ASPECTS OF DIVING \n Equalization As a diver descends, the pressure increase causes the air in their body's air spaces to compress. The air spaces in their ears, mask, and lungs become like vacuums as the compressing air creates a negative pressure. Delicate membranes, like the ear drum, can get sucked into theses air spaces, causing pain and injury. This is one of the reasons that a diver must equalize their ears for scuba diving. On ascent, the reverse happens. \nDecreasing pressure causes the air in a diver's air spaces to expand. The air spaces in their ears and lungs experience a positive pressure as they become overfull of air, leading to a pulmonary barotrauma or a reverse block. In a worst case scenario this could burst a diver's lungs or eardrums. To avoid a pressure-related injury (such as an ear barotrauma) a diver must equalize the pressure in their body's air spaces with the pressure around them. To equalize their air spaces on descent a diver adds air to their body airspaces to counteract the \"vacuum\" effect by breathing normally, this adds air to their lungs every time they inhale adding air to their mask by breathing out their nose adding air to their ears and sinuses by using one of several ear equalization techniques To equalize their air spaces on ascent a diver releases air from their body air spaces so that they do not become overfull by breathing normally, this releases extra air from their lungs every time they exhale ascending slowly and allowing the extra air in their ears, sinuses and mask to bubble out on its own Manuel will be included how to use properly \n When purchasing the Dive Portable Lungs Kit you understand that you are using it at your own risk. fully understand the risks and challenges of diving READ over FAQ and Manuel 'Included with package'\nhttps://www.instagram.com/diveportablelungs/ https://www.facebook.com/diveportablelungs/", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 49 or more", "title": "Dive Tank", "descp": "Get your extra Dive Portable Lungs tank\n1 aluminum Dive Tank\n48cu\n3000 psi\nRefill adapter for hand-pump\nPressure gauge\nUnscrew your regulator and easily attach to your other tank\nFill up extra tanks for continuous diving\nHappy Diving!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["6 backers", "Limited (9 left of 15)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 395 or more", "title": "Early Bird Scuba Starter Kit", "descp": "Includes:\nDive Portable Lungs Tank\nCross Body Bag\n4 stage regulator\n3-Stage 3000psi Hand pump With case\nReady to Dive Package\nGet the offer before its gone!

However, if you are not a trained scuba diver there are restrictions on use and risks to be aware of. Misuse of the Scorkl can be dangerous. Whilst decompression sickness (more commonly known as \u201cthe bends\u201d) isn't much of a risk because of the depth and time restrictions of such a small cylinder, pulmonary damage (chest expansion injury) is nevertheless a risk if a user holds their breath during ascent or ascends too quickly.\nNon-scuba trained users should not use the Scorkl below 3m depth or more than five times in one day. Staying above 3m dramatically reduces this risk of pulmonary damage (although does not eliminate it entirely). Each purchaser will be provided with an information kit informing them of this (and other) risks of using the Scorkl as well as strategies to avoid them. These strategies will include, but not be limited to, staying above 3m in depth and not holding one's breath and/or exhaling during ascent, and not ascending too quickly.  \nScuba-trained users will be able to use the Scorkl below 3m at their discretion but they too will be warned of the same risks.  \nThe Scorkl is only intended for shallow water use. We recommend that scuba-trained users not use the Scorkl below 10m and that non-scuba-trained users stay above 3m in depth as mentioned above.  \nEach Scorkl comes fitted with a pressure gauge so that the user can know how much air remains in the cylinder at any time.  \nAIR QUALITY\nThe Scorkl can be filled either directly from a scuba tank or from our high-pressure hand pump. If filled from a scuba tank that itself has been filled by a commercial compressed air supplier, the air can be assured to be of good quality because of industry supplier standards. These standards are concerned mainly with carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, oil and water levels. Since the Scorkl hand pump doesn't have as many working parts as a mechanical dive compressor, and is muscle-powered rather than petrol powered, the risk of contamination from latent carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide is dramatically reduced. This is the same for oil contaminants. Notwithstanding this, each Scorkl pump comes fitted with an air filter which is comprised of the same materials, and performs the same function, as a filter fitted to a mechanical dive compressor. The Scorkl filter should be replaced after fifty refills and extras will be available for purchase after the conclusion of the Kickstarter campaign.  \nEQUIPMENT STANDARDS, CARE AND MAINTENANCE  \nThe Scorkl cylinder and regulator are made to the same international specifications and standards as normal scuba cylinders and regulators and need to be visually inspected and/or tested as regularly as the guidelines in your country require (some are different). This may be as regularly as every year or every one hundred dives.  \nThe information kit provided to each purchaser will include information regarding recommended best practice methods for care and maintenance of each of the Scorkl components (cylinder, regulator, filter, hand pump, case).\n                      The Scorkl cylinder is manufactured to the same specifications and manufacturing standards as a normal SCUBA cylinder\nThe Scorkl regulator is an always-on, breathe-on-demand, balanced single stage regulator and uses the same time proven technology found in regulators used by SCUBA divers around the world. Each Scorkl comes with a pressure gauge which tells you how much air is left at any time\nEach Scorkl comes with a FREE scuba tank refill adapter which enables you to refill the Scorkl from a scuba tank in seconds.\nIf you want to be able to refill the Scorkl whenever and wherever you like, we have developed a high-pressure hand pump option. See below for how it works.\n  The hand pump filter (below) filters air moisture and impurities\nAdventure Case to transport and store your full Scorkl kit safely \n  High-pressure hand pump can pump to 3,000psi+, filling the Scorkl with enough air to last up to 10 minutes underwater. It achieves these extreme pressures by using an intricate four-stage system:\n  The Scorkl regulator and high pressure hand pump have been in development for the last twelve months, with multiple sample orders manufactured and refined.\n    FREE SHIPPING GLOBALLY\n FREE SHIPPING GLOBALLY\n FREE SHIPPING GLOBALLY\n FREE SHIPPING GLOBALLY\n  We will endeavour to manufacturer and ship within a four month timeframe from the end of the campaign period\n  This project is promoted by Jellop, a direct\u00ac response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks and challenges\n\nThe Scorkl and hand pump require high-precision manufacturing and high-quality materials since they both operate with air stored at high pressures. The primary components are: the Scorkl cylinder, Scorkl regulator, hand pump chambers, hand pump rods, scuba tank refill adapter and hand pump air filter. All components have already been manufactured to high quality during sample runs.\n\nThe primary risk is of production delays. Coordinating with an overseas factory and maintaining quality throughout every step is a challenge. Fulfillment and shipping becomes a hurdle when dealing with thousands of orders. We will not rush through these steps and will tackle them carefully, one by one. We will take the Scorkl to the \"design for manufacturing\" step soon, and the target is to ship out units in October 2017.\n\nThere is some risk that items will not come exactly as pictured, due to manufacturing considerations. The promised function will not be different, and any style changes if any will be iterative and non-significant to the original look and feel.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge AU$ 10 or more", "title": "SCORKL FAN CLUB", "descp": "(7 USD, 7 EUR)\nNot yet ready for a Scorkl but keen to support the campaign?

I'm also a paramedic and know that average breathing is about 15 breaths per minutes so you only have about 2 minutes on the bottom at 10 meters... that's it.

Would I use it... I already do... it's called a Spare Air. How often does the cylinder need to be inspected and certified... and at what cost? How often does the regulator need service?

It superimposes an image of your subject onto your paper. You see your pencil and your subject at the same time. Trace what you see!\nBack on Kickstarter!\n In 2013, along with fellow Art Professor Golan Levin, I launched the NeoLucida project on Kickstarter. Our goal was to make this amazing\u2014but obsolete\u2014tool available again. We hoped there was a small group of art/tech/history nerds like us who might want to try a camera lucida, but couldn\u2019t afford a vintage one. To our surprise, over 11,000 (!) backers helped us make many more NeoLucidas than we ever planned. Most had never heard of a camera lucida; they just wanted to draw and the NeoLucida gave them an entry point. We scaled up production by bringing Kickstarter veterans Big I Design on board as manufacturing partners. We even won a prestigious Core77 Design Award along the way! There are now over 25,000 NeoLucidas helping people in 90 countries draw from real life. \n\"Um, this is hard!\"\nOne thing became clear from the feedback. People said, \u201cThis is harder than I thought!\u201d We said, \u201cWe know!\u201d After all, the original NeoLucida copied the prism design of vintage 19th century camera lucidas, which made sharp, clear images, but has a tiny viewing area. To us, it supported the idea that great artists of the past were still incredibly skilled; using a tool wasn't \"cheating.\" This was a provocative media archeology project: NeoLucida users could test what it was like to be an artist 200 years ago. \nBut thousands of people were just excited by using a tool that might make drawing a little less frustrating. Many people appreciated the art history story, but they just wanted to draw. Maybe they used to draw and gave up as a teenager. Maybe they never learned to draw but always wanted to. Many parents wanted to support their kids' creative impulses. The NeoLucida offered an accessible and inexpensive motivation to draw. \nI was inspired. Years of lecturing and running NeoLucida drawing workshops in a half-dozen countries gave me direct exposure with hundreds of aspiring artists. With all the feedback in mind, I went back to the drawing board. \nAfter two years of research and testing prototypes, the NeoLucida is back! People asked for a larger viewing area, but why stop there? The all new design has an extra large viewer to make drawing from life just a bit easier. Say hello to the NeoLucida XL.\n  First, A Little Art History.\nIf you wanted to make a realistic image in the days before photography was invented, you had to draw it.\nFor centuries, artists and inventors developed clever optical drawing instruments to assist with the difficult task of drawing from real life. Devices with mirrors, lenses, and prisms helped with the most challenging part of drawing: flattening a three-dimensional world into the two dimensions of your paper.\nPortrait of Mrs. John Mackie, by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, 1816 (Photo by me while doing research at The Victoria & Albert Museum, London). Ingres' drawings are meticulous but tiny, leading some scholars to suggest Ingres used a camera lucida\nDrawing would be so much easier if you could hold up a piece of glass to your subject and trace its likeness directly onto the flat glass. Your page and your subject would be aligned; you wouldn't have to look away from your subject to see your drawing. Simple devices like the Sighting Grid did precisely this. Instead of glass, a grid of wires made a reference plane. \nSighting Grids by Robert Fludd (Left) (1617-21) and John Bate (right) (1634). The simplest of drawing instruments, the Sighting Grid provides a flat reference plane for translating the 3D world to the 2D page\nSighting Grids were accurate, but slow and cumbersome. As optical technology advanced from the early 17th century onwards, artists and inventors found ways to project images onto paper for tracing. The most advanced of these technologies was the camera lucida, invented by scientist Sir William Hyde Wollaston in 1807. A prism acts like a beam-splitter: part of your vision is directed towards your subject, part towards your paper. This overlap makes it possible to trace directly from real life. \nThe NeoLucida XL borrows from this tradition of simple, effective drawing instruments, but leveraging some modern technology to make a simple and inexpensive version of these ancient tools. \nWant a little more history and a look at the vintage tools that inspired the NeoLucida? Check out this chat and demo with Norman Chan of Adam Savage's Tested.com: \nHow does it work?\nThe main suggestion we got for the original NeoLucida was: \"Can't you just make the prism bigger?\" Actually, no. When you look into the prism, you look at the exposed edge of the prism. It doesn't matter how big the prism is, you still look at the edge. And as the prism gets bigger, the more the image shifts when you move your head. This is bad for tracing (trust me, we made and tried larger prisms. No good). To make the viewing area bigger, the NeoLucida would have to be completely redesigned. Ditch the prism and find other materials to create the ghost reflections.\nThe NeoLucida XL setup: Clamp to a table, position the viewer over your page with your subject in front of you.\nThe NeoLucida XL uses mirror and glass to combine a virtual ghost image of your subject and the real view of your hand. Setting it up is easy: \nClamp the NeoLucida XL to a table or sturdy drawing board. \nBend the adjustable gooseneck so that the viewer is facing your subject and positioned over your paper. \nLook straight down into the viewer to see your page and a ghost image of your subject superimposed. \nTrace what you see!\n  Part of your vision goes through the glass to your pencil. Simultaneously, part of your vision bounces off the glass, then the first-surface mirror, then out to your subject. The result is a ghost image on your page. \nLook down into the NeoLucida XL and a ghost image of your subject appears on top of your page.\nHere's an actual view through the NeoLucida XL. You can see your hand and your subject superimposed. This drawing only took 4 minutes, but proportion and perspective are rendered accurately. Tracing really works!\nNo matter your skill level, the NeoLucida XL helps you make more accurate drawings. Proportion\u2014the relationships between elements of your subject\u2014and perspective\u2014accurate rendering of space\u2014are laid out for you in the ghost image. You can even compose your scene before you draw so your subject fits on your paper the way you want it to. All of this means you can focus on the most important part of drawing: putting pencil to paper. Controlling a pencil to make beautiful lines takes practice. With the NeoLucida XL, you spend less time on laying out your drawing and more time drawing. \nSpecial Features\nThe basic elements in the NeoLucida XL are simple enough: A piece of glass and a mirror placed at a certain angle to each other. This arrangement is the same as it was in the early 19th century. After testing dozens of samples and prototypes, we've developed the NeoLucida XL to be the best version of the glass-and-mirror camera lucida ever made. \nGlass and Mirror. The quality of the glass and the mirror are key to make the camera lucida ghost image as sharp and clear as possible. The mirror we use is a First Surface mirror. Typical mirror is made with a reflective surface applied to the rear of a piece of glass. This is how most commercial mirrors are made. Because the light travels through the glass to get to the mirror, there are additional reflections from the glass surface and tiny distortions from scattering light. This isn't usually a problem for your bathroom mirror, since the mirror is thin and you're not standing that close to it. But if you want a precise reflection with your eye up close to it, you need a sharp reflection. Usually used in scientific applications, a first surface mirror has only one surface reflecting light rays. One surface exposed, one crisp reflection. \nTypical mirror (left) has a reflective surface on the rear face of the glass. This causes minor distortions and soft reflections as light bounces and scatters between reflective layers.\nPortability. Making the NeoLucida viewer larger makes drawing easier, but it also makes the device bulkier. To make the NeoLucida XL as portable as the original NeoLucida, the glass-and-mirror viewer neatly folds into a flat package. Slide it into the custom pouch provided, and toss it in your bag with your art supplies. Easy! The folding action also protects the glass and mirror inside a sandwich of hard plastic to keep the delicate optics safe while in transit. \nThe NeoLucida folds up for easy storage.\n  At just 10 ounces and slim in profile, the NeoLucida XL fits in the handy custom pouch provided. Easy to toss in your bag!\n  When folded, the NeoLucida XL is only 1 inch at its thickest. Compact!\nLegacy Support. The NeoLucida XL is an all new optical design, but it uses the same adjustable gooseneck from the original NeoLucida. If you have the original NeoLucida, you can swap viewers between the gooseneck stands. Save space! Carry both NeoLucida viewers but only one clamp!\nLighting Control. The NeoLucida XL comes with a removable shader to help balance the lighting. It's like custom sunglasses for your NeoLucida! Is the page too bright to see the ghost image? Insert the shader in the bottom slot to dim the image of your page. Is your subject too bright and you can't see your page? Insert the shader in the forward position. When you're not using it, store the shader in the rear of the NeoLucida XL viewer.  \nIf your subject is too bright and it's hard to see your page, use the Shader in the front slot. This will dim your subject view to make your page easier to see.\n  If the page is too bright and it's hard to see your subject, use the Shader in the bottom slot. This will dim your page view to make the subject easier to see.\nA little easier for the little ones. I have two daughters who love to draw, but they couldn't use the original NeoLucida. At 8 and 4 years old, the NeoLucida's requirements of precise eye placement with a tiny prism made it frustrating to them. The NeoLucida XL isn't a toy, but it was made with kids in mind. I've tested it with kids and found that, depending on the skill level, children as young as 6 and 7 can draw with the NeoLucida XL! \nThat's my 8-year-old daughter using the NeoLucida XL to draw her favorite teddy bear. Fun!\nAlmost every child draws. But many give up in their teenage years when drawing skills don't seem to improve. Practicing with tools like the NeoLucida XL to advance skills can help keep kids drawing into adulthood. \nBacked by Primary Research\nThe NeoLucida XL isn't just a product, it's the result of years of primary research. As an art professor, the NeoLucida is part of a decade of research into the relationship between technology and art history. I have one of the most complete camera lucida collections in the world, and have used this personal collection to reverse engineer both the original NeoLucida and the NeoLucida XL. \nOne idea, a century apart. The Magic Art Reproducer (left) from 1952 and A. Alexander's Graphic Mirror (right) from 1840 both use angled glass and a mirror to create the ghost image.\nThe glass-and-mirror design is inspired by several different historical designs. The desire to draw more accurately from life is an old one; 19th century finely crafted brass devices and mid-20th century toys all responded to demand from aspiring artists. \nVintage glass-and-mirror camera lucidas from my personal collection provided primary research for developing the NeoLucida XL. At left, the 1952 Magic Art Reproducer. Center, A. Alexander's Graphic Mirror (1840).\n  Two years of NeoLucida workshops gave me first-hand experience with users.

I animated on the movies ParaNorman, The BoxTrolls, and Kubo and the Two Strings. One of my favorite types of animation (and one of the ways I learned to animate) is flip book cartoons.\n(Above: by Danie Townsley)\nI love how simple flip books are--you don\u2019t need a computer, TV, or app--you just flip the paper and get to see your drawing come to life right in front of your eyes.\nBecome a backer by pledging to this project and receive your own kit plus extras!\nNote that the Light Pad pictured here is a prototype, and the final version may vary in appearance, due to design improvements--All for the better of course!\nBelow is a breakdown of each pledge level:\n  2 Large Packs of Blank Flip Book Paper \n(The Standard Kit makes a total of FOUR 60-page flip books or TWO 120-page flip books.*)\nLED Light Pad \nUSB Power Cable \nBinding Screws in Two Sizes \nHex Key \nPencil \nPencil Sharpener \nEraser \nPlus An EXCLUSIVE Printed Flip Book by Andy Bailey\n  Includes all of the items in the Standard Kit\nPlus TWO ADDITIONAL Large Paper Packs with Binding Screws\n(The Deluxe Kit makes a total of EIGHT 60-page flip books or FOUR 120-page flip books.)\nIncludes the EXCLUSIVE Printed Flip Book by Andy Bailey\nPlus an EXCLUSIVE Printed Flip Book by Another Professional Animator\n   2 Large Packs of Blank Flip Book Paper\n(Makes a total of FOUR 60-page or TWO 120-page flip books.*)\nNo Kit, Light Pad, Extras or Exclusives\n   4 Large Packs of Blank Flip Book Paper\n(Makes a total of EIGHT 60-page or FOUR 120-page flip books.*) \nNo Kit, Light Pad, Extras or Exclusives\n      PLAY\n\n Above: by Graham Annable\nPLAY\n\nAbove: by Anthony Straus\nPLAY\n\n  Above: by Dobrin Yanev\nPLAY\n\nAbove: by Kevin Parry\nPLAY\n\nAbove: by Malcolm Lamont  (Note: This one is a bit \"gross\" and may not be suitable for all kids, but the animation is awesome!)\nPLAY\n\nAbove: by Jeff Riley\nPLAY\n\nAbove: by Andy Bailey (This is one I made as a kid.)\nPLAY\n\nAbove: by Andy Bailey\nPLAY\n\nAbove: Simple Bouncing Ball Demo\nPLAY\n\nAbove by: Adam Fisher\nPLAY\n\nAbove: by Kim Slate\nInternational Shipping?\nWe are working to find a good option for international fulfillment.

This will allow you to receive all of our updates and keep you informed of international shipping options, whether that becomes available during or after the campaign ends.

We have eliminated the need for plastic tubes or pumps that create messes and gunky buildup over time. \nNot to mention, toothpaste tubes sit in our landfills for over 500 years before they decompose. Poppits packaging is 100% biodegradable- now that\u2019s something to smile about!\nPoppits comes in two varieties: Whitening Poppits\u2122 for adults and Kids Poppits\u2122\nEach softgel pod is made of an edible plant-derived cellulose film that melts in the mouth. The toothpaste inside is fluoride-free and made from natural ingredients. There are no animal fats anywhere in our products.\n\nOur future phases of manufacturing will include additional flavors and formulas including a natural fluoride version.\nPoppits in the news:\n    Sure, there are fun toothbrushes out there, but what about the actual toothpaste?\nKids love Poppits and the sensation of popping it in their mouth and the burst of fun fruity flavor. Poppits are a fun and easy way to get kids engaged in oral care.\nEach Kids Poppits\u00ae box contains three fun fruity flavors; Sweet Strawberry, Green Apple and Merry Berry. \nLearning good oral hygiene as a kid carries over to adulthood. Poppits has the dentist-recommended amount of toothpaste in each pod, so kids learn the safe, effective amount they need to have healthy teeth.\n    Traditional toothpaste tubes get sticky residue all over the sink or over the top of the tube when caps get lost. With Poppits, these messes are a thing of the past.\n  It makes perfect sense. There\u2019s no more squeezing that gunky toothpaste tube into the bristles of your brush! Effectively reducing cross-contamination, Poppits are the most hygienic way to get a healthy, pearly white smile.\n  Breathe a breath of fresh air! Whitening Poppits come with 90 softgel pods. Each one contains fresh minty toothpaste sealed in a water-soluble whitening film to brighten your smile! \nIt\u2019s always hard to get that last bit of toothpaste from a rolled-up squeezed tube but with Poppits you get it all! Right down to the last fresh pod! \nPoppits are the perfect travel accessory because they are small, convenient and most importantly, meet TSA requirements for your carry-on luggage.\nNo more wrapping a toothpaste tube in a plastic bag and having it burst! \n  Poppits\u2122 are bringing a revolutionary change to the way we brush our teeth. This is the biggest breakthrough ever in the toothpaste industry. No more plastic tubes! Good for you. Good for the planet. \n   Our custom-designed paperboard packaging is environmentally-friendly and biodegradable. By not using plastic toothpaste tubes you will be doing your part to reduce plastic pollution. You\u2019re welcome mother nature! \nIt is so cool! Cooler than Willy Wonka\u2019s Chocolate Factory, we think! The manufacturing plant that produces Poppits also produces many other household consumer goods. \nStay tuned! In the coming weeks, we\u2019ll post a wee video in our updates to show you Poppits being made.\nWe are proud to partner with the most trusted manufacturers and suppliers in the USA to bring you the very best.

At first glance En Route appears to be very light and simplistic. That is not true. This game has a level of suspense and energy only exceeded by social deduction games.\nI have struggled to convey what makes this game interesting. This game is intense and creates a lot of suspense as you race to finish your objectives before the other players. Since the goals are hidden you don't know when your opponents will take take resources you need or even when someone else will win the game. I really love the energy of the game, I would like to convey that message to you, the viewers of this campaign.\nThis is a gateway game. You can play it with your non-gamer friends.\nPledge $1 for immediate access to the print-and-play\nEasy to Learn, Easy to Play\nEn Route was designed to enjoy with your family and friends. It only takes a few minutes to learn and less than an hour to play. Yet it still requires strategy and engages players of all levels.\nRules\nDownload the instruction booklet to see the rules. All backers get immediate access to the print-and-play game. Which includes PDFs for the instruction booklet, game board, cards and tokens.\nHere is a brief overview of the rules:\nPlace the board in the center of the table (I know all the podcasters out there love this rule. Ahem, Rolling Dice & Taking Names)\nPlayers have a hand of 4 action cards and 3 goal cards. The hand is secret.\nThe goal is to deliver the 2 goods indicated on the goal card to the indicated city for each of your 3 goal cards.\nThe cards in hand can be played to move items from adjacent cities or to produce the good that city produces.\nUp to three goods tokens can be moved when transiting between cities.\nWhen a city has goods on it, it's considered open and you can move to it or produce its good without playing a card from your hand.\nThe goal card can be played as an action card, but beware if you play it before completing it you'll show your objective to your opponenets.\nThe goods are limited and the conflict becomes real when your opponent takes advantage of the pile of goods you are move toward your own goal.\nBeautiful Components\n A lot of attention was given to the design and layout of the components. The cards are easy to read even when fanned out in your hands. The board is elegant and simple. The tokens are marked and easy to distinguish.\nGame Play\nEach player begins the game with three hidden goals. Players take turns playing cards to produce goods or move them between cities. As the game progresses the players will reveal their completed objectives. The game will keep you on the edge of your seat as you try to be the first to complete all three goals.\nComponents\nWe have received and tested several variations of components. All final components will be high quality and durable. The box and cards will have linen finish. The cards will be poker quality, ivory core cards. We continue to look for ways to improve the quality and experience of the game. We hope to upgrade the paperboard tokens to printed wooden tokens with our first stretch goal.\nDevelopment\nEn Route has already been prototyped, play tested and edited. The game play and mechanics are solid and the art is finished. We've enjoyed developing this game and playing it with our friends and family. We hope you have the chance to enjoy it as much as we have.\nEn Route has easy to understand instructions so it's easy to get going and start having fun.\nShipping\nWe are working with fulfillment companies to provide Canadian and European Union backers customs-free shipping. We know you don't want to pay extra customs or VAT and you won't have to.\nCreators\nEn Route was created by Nathan and Jake Jenne. Both Jake and Nathan enjoy designing games together. They have spent many years working through various projects together and hope you'll enjoy this game as much as they have. Nathan and Jake sincerely appreciate your help.\nImportant Stuff\nThis game is friendly to the colorblind. We don't exclusively rely on colors to distinguish tokens, cards or placement. Additionally, the text is easy to read and high contrast.\nWe really focus on keeping our games family-friendly. This means we don't use questionable graphics. We don't use suggestive content. We keep the language clean and friendly. This doesn't mean we neuter the experience for adults or make games devoid of strategy. This simply means we want to reach the largest audience possible and we don't want you to be embarrassed when your kids, friends, parents, spouse walk into the room.\nWe strongly support women in gaming. Nothing we do will indicate otherwise.\nTrack this project on kicktraq", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur biggest risks and challenges are the typical risks and challenges associated with sourcing and printing the game in volume and the logistics of delivery.\n\nWhile we don't expect huge problems we are preparing contingency plans for some of the more common issues.\n\nThe biggest risk is delayed delivery.

In the 1930s-50s they became the go-to camera for press photographers and artists, with American photographer Ansel Adams becoming a pioneer in landscape photography. \nSince then this branch of photography has defiantly continued to produce some of the most important and beautiful pictures ever created. It has resisted the digital revolution and continues to attract new, passionate photographers despite the technology being over 100 years old. This attraction is for one simple reason, large format photography is as far away from digital photography you could possibly get, there is 0% automation, your camera does not have a microchip for a brain. It has you. \nIt is entirely pure photography and allows maximum creative freedom. The large format camera is a tool for art, not convenience. The images have warmth to them akin to the sound of a vinyl record, and a quality to them you just can\u2019t quite put your finger on. So maybe it isn\u2019t one simple reason, maybe I don\u2019t really know exactly why these cameras are so special. I do however know they are manifestly important to the future of photography, and to us! \nSo why redesign this \u2018perfect\u2019 camera? Well, we feel there is a need for an affordable non second hand camera that is simple to use, lightweight, compact, and most of all a great tool to get new photographers passionate about large format photography. This fantastic art form will only live on if people continue to discover and enjoy it. I hope the Intrepid Camera can help people do just that. \nFinal camera will be made from high quality Birch Ply Wood milled using a CNC Router with Aluminium supports and hinges, so it will look slightly different to the one above. \nGround Glass focusing screen that lets you compose and focus your image by moving the lens with the rack and pinion mechanism. \nTakes 75-300mm lenses in Linhof/Technika style lens boards.\nFull movements on the front standard.\nThe design gives the camera excellent strength and rigidity, whilst keeping the weight low at around 1.2kg.\nCompatible with standard film holders as well as the 405 and 545/545i (if funding is successful some of the funds are earmarked for the development of a Graflok back).\nChoice of four bellows colours Black, Blue, Red and Green.\nStandard Tripod mount\nPortrait and landscape rotating back \nPlease note the camera does not come with a lens, please see the lens buying guide bellow for help.\nCamera folds down to 190mmx190mmx120mm.\nCompact and light weight enough to not be a burden whilst out in the field.\n4x5 is an amazing format. The film comes in sheets that are much larger than your standard 35mm- 13x larger in fact. This lends an incredible amount of clarity and depth in your images. The film would be considered \"HDR\" in the digital world due to the amount of detail it can capture. 4x5 film is still produced and readily available all over the world, with Ilford, Fuji and Kodak manufacturing some of the most high tech films that have ever existed.\n (Holding up a sheet of Fuji Velvia 50 on a light box)\n (Taken using the intrepid camera onto Fuji Provia 100f)\n (Taken using The Intrepid Camera onto Ilford HP5)\n (A 150% crop of an image taken onto Fuji Velvia 50)\nWe have kept the rewards simple; two products in a few different ways.

If we are successful here it will allow us to set up the workshop and buy the equipment we need to produce the cameras economically. It will also allow us to develop new exciting products for the large format community, including products like an 8x10 camera and range of film holders. \nThere is a vast quantity of lenses to choose from when it comes to 4x5 cameras, from 'swirly background producing' brass barrel lenses to tack sharp modern lenses. It would be foolish of us to try and talk about them all here, \nSo check out these websites for information and prices.\nGreat place for used lenses https://www.keh.com\nGreat place for LF stuff (including lenses) http://www.catlabs.info/\nThis list is a little old so ignore the prices but it is very comprehensive http://www.largeformatphotography.info/lenses/LF4x5in.html\nThis list is a little more up to date, and features some other intersting info about large format lenses http://www.ebonycamera.com/articles/lenses.html\nMain things to remember when buying are to make sure that:\nThe glass is clean and has no fungus.\nThe lens is in a shutter that does not stick and works well (accurate speeds etc).\nThe lens filter ring has no dents on it.\nIn all honesty you can't go far wrong getting any Schneider, Rodenstock, Fuji or Nikon Large format lens. As long as it is between 75-300mm, in good condition and mounted on a Linhof/Technika style lens board, it will be a fantastic place to start. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have been working on the design for over a year now and will continue to do so as the Kick-starter runs. This being said there are elements of the design that can only realistically be tested once we have been funded; for example changing the support struts and hinges to aluminium instead of wood. \n\nThe manufacturing method has been tested on a small scale, but obviously not on the scale that will be required if we are successful. However this has been very thoroughly worked out and we are confident it will scale up with no big problems.\n\nAs with all Kickstarter projects, customers are exposed to the process of product development and this has its risks attached. Saying that, we are fairly late on in the product development stage, which gives us slightly more confidence in when we can deliver this product.

It's here!\n\"Selfies\" was the word of the year in 2013. In 2014 let's all agree to  start taking selfies that don't look like selfies -- with the GripSnap! The GripSnap (patent pending) is AWESOME, whether you're taking a group photo with your friends or doing kickass GoPro videos from the hood of your car. There are so many uses for the GripSnap, you're going to need more drive space for all of your crazy photos! \nIt's not just for iPhones!\nThe GripSnap works with smartphones of all shapes and sizes up to and including the Samsung Galaxy Note, which is 3.27\" wide.\nStop asking people to take your picture, or worse, having a phone full of pictures without you in them! Finally, everyone can be in the photo -- just snap the GripSnap to pretty much any ferrous metal surface, and using one of many available camera timer apps, take pictures that include the whole crew, instead of always missing one person\u2026\nSnap your GripSnap to a bike rack\nSnap the GripSnap to any ferrous metal surface...\nStretch Goal Added!!\nIf we reach the $25,000 mark, we're adding a new reward -- the GripSnap Car Mount! If you use your phone for navigation or if you want an easy dash-cam setup, you'll want this! See the prototype in the GripSnap Update #4 \nTo reach this goal, we're going to need your help spreading the word.

There are lots of camera timer apps out there. Some are even voice or sound activated, so you can clap your hands or yell \"Cheese!\" and your phone will take your picture. Here are a few of the apps we like that work GREAT with the GripSnap:\n Mounting your GoPro was never easier:\nSnap your GoPro to any ferrous metal surface\nThe GripSnap works great and looks pretty cool too...\nSnap your GripSnap to a water fountain...\nWhere will you snap your GripSnap?\nConcepting the GripSnap on paper last year\n What's next?\nI have manufactured and brought other products to market and my last big product landed me a spot on Shark Tank. But this is the coolest product I've developed, because it has so many uses. I'm psyched to get one into your hands!!\nWe want you to have your GripSnap as soon as possible. Here's the basic timeline we're looking at:\nJuly/August: Meet lots of cool Kickstarters, continue work on mold and plastic encasement for the magnet.\nSeptember: Finalize the conduit type/source/size/length. Have our manufacturers crank out a bunch of our custom sized magnets and get them coated and shipped.\nOctober: Shipping from the manufacturer ALWAYS takes longer than expected, so October is our target month to receive phone clips, production conduit and complete magnets.\nNovember: Assembly and fulfillment. We've got a crazy schedule ahead of us, but we've been doing the footwork for the GripSnap for over a year. We're confident we can make our shipping goal.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have worked very hard to get the GripSnap ready for Kickstarter and full-scale manufacturing, but here are some challenges ahead:\n\nMANUFACTURING: Due to the brittle nature of neodymium magnets, they have a tendency to shatter, which was a problem with our early prototypes. To ensure that this won't happen on the production models, we're working on a strong, but thin, plastic casing for our magnets. We've already got a manufacturer working on the mold and should have samples late this summer. We have confidence in our manufacturer to deliver a great final product, but we have a back-up manufacturer at the ready, should anything go sideways.\n\nPRODUCT ADJUSTMENTS: As the GripSnap gets closer to production, we're going to continue to do some fine tuning, especially on the conduit tubing. Each generation of materials we try gets better and our current version has a high degree of flexibility, coupled with good rigidity. That said, we're going to be able to shorten it, making the GripSnap even more compact, while retaining the flexibility to bend the GripSnap into any position required.

This eliminates the need to have a separate photographer to take the picture for you so that everyone in your group can get #inthepicture.\nHello Kickstarter!\nWe are excited to be here with our first project. We invented CaseCam to enable users to get the very most out of their mobile devices.\nThe case and app were born out of a desire to be included in group photos of friends and family and to enhance the phone\u2019s capacity for capturing hands-free pictures and videos. CaseCam solves a problem faced by students, moms, dads, travelers, video bloggers, and anyone who uses their phone to snap group photos or take video.\nThe scenario is very familiar. You are with a bunch of friends or family, in a special, memorable place and you want to capture that moment, but no one is around to ask, \u201cHey, can you take our photo?\u201d So you, the photographer, get left out of the photo. CaseCam puts everyone back #inthepicture by eliminating the need for a photographer.\nCaseCam also makes taking video much simpler, allowing you to set your phone on any surface and just press record. This allows users to record the moment without having to hold up their phone and watch it through their phone\u2019s screen.\n\u201cI have a tripod with an iPhone attachment but never use it because it takes forever to set up and it\u2019s a lot to carry around. CaseCam is a quick and easy solution to this problem. Now I can film my swing whenever and wherever.\u201d\n- Ryan Young, Golf Professional\n-\u201cIt is a versatile and innovative product that helps capture images in so many practical situations. Taking Pictures with friends has never been easier.\u201d\n- Nick Schonewald, College Student\n-Whenever I travel, it's almost impossible to take group photos without leaving someone out - usually myself. CaseCam makes it easy to take photos of my friends no matter where I go.\n- Allie, Mullen, Student/Traveler\nCaseCam uses a flip-out mirror kickstand to allow you to take pictures and video without having to hold up your phone. The mirror reflects the light into the iPhone camera and the kickstand clicks into the case when you don\u2019t need it. It also works as a horizontal kickstand to prop up your phone for viewing videos.\nThe CaseCam App inverts the images and video that you capture so that they appear right-side-up again after being reflected off of the mirror. (And yes, it\u2019s free.)\nThe app saves your pictures and video to your iphone\u2019s camera roll so that your can edit them and share them like you normally would or you can share them directly from the CaseCam App!\nThe CaseCam App allows users to take group photos like never before, you can use it to:\nTake pictures with an adjustable timer\nTake pictures remotely by syncing with your friend\u2019s IOS device, or your iPad.\nThe app\u2019s innovative WiFi-viewfinder feature lets you use your friend\u2019s iPhone to see what your CaseCam sees, so you can frame the photo while you are in it\nAdjustable Timer.\nControlling CaseCam remotely.\nFraming the picture while you are in it!\nCaseCam is designed to be extremely low profile, but robust enough to protect your phone from wear and tear just like any other high quality protective cell phone case. It is made from impact-resistant injection-molded Polycarbonate \u2014 the same material used to make bullet-proof glass!\nThe case is also designed to look and feel great in your hand and your pocket, the slim design leaves lots of room for other items in your pocket, you may even forget that it\u2019s there. The case leaves the buttons, audio port, and the thunderbolt port unobstructed so that any headphones or thunderbolt cable can plug in without needing to remove the case.\nThe mirror is made of optical quality Soda Lime glass with an extremely tight surface flatness tolerance so that your images will not be distorted at all and there is no perceivable loss in image quality. The mirror now stows toward the phone when it is not in use protecting the mirror from scratches\n Vote on additional CaseCam colors and phone models (please note that the images below were taken of a previous prototype):\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/s/KQP3VLZ\nPink, Navy Blue, Deep Red, Teal-Gray\nAs you can see the CaseCam produces crisp, clear, undistorted images.\n *Note: KS lowers the quality of the images we have uploaded.\nEvery dollar helps as we try to bring CaseCam to life, thank you for your support!\nWelcome earlybirds!

This case is compatible with both the iPhone 5 and 5S. \n[Retail Value - $40] Add $25 USD to ship outside the US.\nNever be left out of the picture again with your very own CaseCam!

We live in Kirkland and two kids Gia (6) and Rocco (4). I currently work as a Managing Real Estate Broker at a small real estate office in downtown Kirkland, WA. We have been thinking for years about how a product like CaseCam would improve the day-to-day lives of other parents like us.\nLast year I was looking across the sea of parents sitting on bleachers watching their kids in the preschool holiday show. It seemed like every 3rd parent was, like me, unsuccessfully trying to control their wobbling iPhone camera in their hand while their elbow was uncomfortably propped up on their knee. CaseCam's retractable mobile stand would enable all those parents to shoot better, more stable videos while actually being able to watch firsthand and enjoy the show.\nWe love taking our kids on adventures and vacations. Looking back through the photo album there was only one parent, either my wife or myself, in every family photo. It's just too inconvenient to find a trustworthy impromptu photographer at the beach, zoo or Disneyland that has the patience to frame the shot the way you want.

From hobbyists to semi-pros to aspiring photographers, Flekt helps you take your photography to the next level. \nWhen you love photography like we do, why settle for good when you have the power to be great. Until Flekt, there wasn't a camera accessory that gave you high quality light for affordable prices. \nNatural light in the room vs. Flekt lighting\nNow you can forget fancy and expensive equipment because Flekt gives anyone who loves photography the power to create professional photos. Whether you're in a studio shooting products, at home with the family or on location capturing an indoor or nightime wedding, bring out the inner pro-photographer in you by getting lost in the fun, inspiring and creative world of your very own photo shoot. \niPhone - natural light\nDSLR - cFlekt with silver Exciter Technology\u2122\nWe weren't kidding when we said Flekt was simple and hassle-free. With just THREE parts to the Flekt system, it's easy to create high-quality lighting:\nSimply slip the magAttach into your hot-shoe, lock it down and you're ready to go - it's that easy. It's called magAttach because all attachments connect with magnets to allow fluid pivoting to direct light onto your subject.\nFlekt's ignitor reflector attaches to the front of the magAttach and redirects the light from the pop-up flash 180 degrees back into whichever attachment is on your system. Designed after a right-angle prism, but with concave reflectors, it is an efficient way to redirect light without losing it. \nWe've created the first attachment and we call it cFlekt. The c stands for concave because we designed it around a modified concave reflection principle.  It attaches magnetically to the magAttach and can utilize white, silver and gold removable reflectors.  We are open to any user designing new, exciting attachments for the photography community.\nOur attachments magnetically grip to the magAttach, and have fluid movement to add soft light to your subject.  Use the wall, use the ceiling, anything you can dream of to help you create the photo you want!  With each of the systems, you can have multiple texture and color choices to enhance and change your light. \nOur first inserts will be white, gold and silver.  Choose gold to warm when shooting against the sun, or choose silver with high contrast to kick up the specular highlights for fashion.  Additional inserts will come in the future as well as any other surface and color we can all think of!!\nThese attachments help you create high-quality photos without the hassle or expense of professional equipment.  Simply use the Flekt System with your DSLR to capture beautiful, inspiring pictures that you're extremely proud to call your own.\nBecause we reflect light, we have the opportunity to shape photons in ways that no other product can do. Imagine nano-structured fresnels, retroreflective focusing elements, colors, anything is possible. Our first two coatings will be Lambertian White\u2122 and silver/gold metals with Exciter Technology\u2122 enhancement.\ncFlekt with Lambertian White\u2122 insert\ncFlekt with silver Exciter Technology\u2122 insert\ncFlekt with gold Exciter Technology\u2122 insert\ncFlekt with Lambertian White\u2122 insert\ncFlekt with Lambertian White\u2122 insert\nAs a photographer, I got to a point where I wanted to start taking better photographs, so I got into studio photography. One of the products I used to rent all the time was a beauty dish - it was consistently the best form of light I got, so I started wondering if I could create the same quality of lighting from the pop up flash. That's when I met with Impact Design Associates and we got started working on a prototype.\nWe came up with several different design concepts, ensuring we exercised both visual and functional ideas.\nOnce we had our first working prototype, we sent out a bunch of photographers for some beta testing. Using all of their feedback and data, we were able to refine the product even more.\nWe've been designing and refining Flekt for 7 years now but we haven't had the funds to bring it to market - tooling and production can be very costly. So, we turned to Kickstarter because we feel that what we're offering is mutually beneficial - you support our project and help us raise the funds we need to produce Flekt.  It's a win-win, right? \nThe quote from our manufacturer has given us a number we are comfortable with considering our Kickstarter funding goal. We are considering a minimum of 1,000 units - the lead time for 1,000 units is 6 weeks and for 50,000, it's 3 months. We tried to reflect maximum delivery time in our promises to deliver and want to keep a realistic view of over-estimating, not over-promising. We will, of course, keep our backers informed along the way, and will be working to save time anywhere we can without compromising the quality of the product. Flekt is a long-term product with global reach and we want to keep our customers happy for the long term.   \n\nIn terms of shipping and fulfillment, we will use Amazon FBA MCF and Fulfillrite. Fulfillrite will be our kitting facility where the coated reflectors and final Flekt units will be boxed and shipped. Logistics for time frame of arrival of these elements are still being figured out, but we will advise as they get dialed in.

I am liking the current momentum and will strive to maintain it to get Flekt into your hands.\nSince our last update, we have made two sets of fit and function prototypes to test design modifications. We made an exciting change that we think you\u2019ll really enjoy. Once we received and played with the fit and function prototypes, as well as our CNC machined test prime reflectors, we realized that the friction method we settled on to hold our prime reflectors in place may wear out over time causing the reflector to fall out. One early prototype we created had a magnet system to hold the reflectors in place, so we took that and implemented a new magnet concept into our current engineering and we are proud to say, it rocks! Now the reflectors seat firmly and have a satisfying \u201cclick\u201d when the prime reflector locks into place, and a similarly satisfying separation of the magnets when taking it out!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #15", "update_userinfo": "Post Holiday Update", "update_content": "Hi Backers,\nIt\u2019s been a couple months since we last posted an update, and I am sorry about that.

But you overcoming those hurdles does us little to no good when you don't have sufficient funds remaining to go into production. Instead, you're seeking additional investors before you can move forward. I thought the point of setting a monetary goal amount on KickStarter was to use THOSE funds to make your dream a reality. You should've asked for more at the time. Instead, you low-balled the estimate and here we are. So what's next, a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for production? Instead, how about a GoFundMe campaign to pay back all of your original backers? Honestly, at this point I don't even care when or IF Flekt ever ships out.

This is where we could use Time and Money: \nIf funded, we want to use our Kickstarter funds to purchase a 3D printer so we can more rapidly prototype some different ideas and parts for the universal support feature, as well as future add-ons for the dock. Corey has the 3D skills to be able to perfectly utilitize this tech to make our ideas into reality. Once the part is finalized, we can quickly mass produce and implement it into all the models.\n.\nProduction Plan\nThe production will be handled here in Burbank, California by ourselves in collaboration with a local laser-cutting workshop.\nCurrently, we're building all of our test models out of a 500 sq. ft. apartment and driving our neighbors crazy with power tools in our storage space (complete with 100ft extension cable haphazardly strewn about the lawn).\nIf we're funded, we'll be renting out a small industrial workspace for our tools and assembly process. We'll need to store a lot of lumber, woodstain and painting materials, and power tools in order to get this wacky thing off the ground. Fortunately, we already have a few places lined up and ready to go.\nInitially, we'll have a crew of 4 people building the docks. If we receive (squee) overwhelming support, we'll give ourselves high-fives all around, and hire on additional help to complete the orders. Fortunately, we have worked out a process that should allow us to get quite a few of these made quickly and efficiently, so our manpower needs will be relatively low.\nRewards\nMinidesks\n\u00bb Paintings from My Cat ($1)Exactly what it says.

More funding means better tools\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe've been working on this by ourselves for months. We love the product. We created it because we want to have one on each of our desks. However, we need to establish that there's a market for this thing.\nWe're animators and designers. We've done game design, programming, studied Arduino, worked in stereography, and generally just attacked whatever we decide is the next thing we want to do. In short, we're detail-oriented control freaks... in a good way. We want to make something great, the right way, and for the right cost.\nFrankly, we don't have a huge savings account, and we don't think we need one because we have plans to keep our overhead low. We don't want to involve investors, simply because we can't afford to lose any percentage of control over this thing to someone who won't understand why we're making this and why we don't want to overcharge everyone for it. We're perfectionists and weirdoes, and we'd like to think we know exactly where these products can go.\nThat's where Kickstarter comes in. For one thing, you all can help us prove that there's still a market for this kind of thing. There's something beautiful about hand-drawn animation, and we think we're not the only ones who see it and still get excited about it.\nSecondly, having the money up front allows us to really push our production into full swing. We're going to need a reasonable amount of money to buy the bulk materials, rent the buliding space, and pay any helping hands we may need along the way.\nLastly, we believe this has the potential to be the beginning of something great. We're not looking for a pile of money to run off into the sunset with. We have plans, designs, and a pile of ideas sitting on hold at the moment, waiting for their time to shine. Some of these are features we'd like to develop and eventually add to the dock's functionality. Some of them are still animation-related but entirely different products altogether. If this thing manages to take off, you'd better believe that money will going straight back into new products for animation lovers everywhere.\nWho Are We\nWe are a couple of animation nerds. We watch documentaries about the multi-plane camera and argue about whether or not something we're watching is rotoscoped. Animation and its history has always played a large role in forming who we are as both humans and artists. We like to take our love for animation and art and share it with our friends, and we always geek out out on things like old animation desks and art supplies. If you're interested in more specific information about us, here's a quick breakdown of our two project leaders.  \nCorey & Tammy\n\nTammy Smith is a native Floridian who grew up with an above-average dose of the Disney channel and the Walt Disney World theme parks. Thanks to her family, she always had a strong background in science, arts, history, and sassy lady-ness. A winner of Terrible Timing, she made it to college just at the 2D animation programs were shelved. Ever since graduating from UCF as a Digital Media major, she has never stopped advancing her education on her own. She is a self-taught Illustrator, web designer, animator, model builder, & cat-enthusiast, and has more Twitter followers than her husband can understand.  \nTechnical background with 14+ years experience in IT including web, app, game design, & UI/UX\nArtist & Producer - Experience running & supporting creative events, conventions, & more\nHobby Collector - Never afraid to teach herself a new skill to achieve a goal\n  Corey Smith is a country boy from Southern Illinois. He went to school for digital animation and spends most of his time working in the VFX industry. He lends some construction experience and power tool knowhow to the mix, having worked on two Habitat for Humanity projects, as well as building his parents' home in Southern Illinois. Whenever Tammy dreams up an idea, he provides a functioning 3D model of it. He also likes coffee, waffles, and pie.\nVFX stereo-conversion vet with credits like The Avengers & Star Trek Into Darkness\n3D generalist - Modeling, Texturing, Animating, & more\nVoice actor & general film production guy", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile we are veteran artists, we don't claim to be product designers. One thing we've been lacking is solid input from experienced veterans regarding product design, manufacturing, package design, and shipping/storage methods.\n\nNone of that is going to stop us, of course. We've spent buckets and buckets of time doing research in any fields that we're lacking in. We feel like we've settled on an excellent design that's easy to reproduce, even if we have to build them in our garage. \n\nIt is conceivable (and likely) that we'll run into some sort of trouble along the way in one of these areas. However, six months ago, we'd never used a laser cutter before. Today, we have a slew of product templates designed for laser printing, and a pile of beautiful laser-cut desktops. This is the natural order of things for us, and we tend to find a way.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #21", "update_userinfo": "Air Compressors and You!", "update_content": "The final surveys requesting your color preferences and current addresses have been sent, meaning great things are coming your way soon! :D\nThank you all so much for voting on the stains.

This film tells the story of Philip Johnson's New York State Pavilion during the glory days of the fair, and chronicles its demise over the past 50 years. The film details its post-fair use as a 60s concert venue and 70s roller rink, including the years of neglect and the recent growing advocacy efforts to save and repurpose the structure.\nPresent day- Photo by Marco Catini\nTo learn more about who took this \"Present Day\" picture, check out Update #3.\nMODERN RUIN: A World's Fair Pavilion documents what this iconic structure symbolized at the 1964-65 World\u2019s Fair, and preserves many of the fascinating stories that are woven into the fabric of the building\u2019s history. Few people remember that in 1969, some of the greatest musicians of the 20th century - The Grateful Dead, Led Zeppelin, Fleetwood Mac, Santana and many others - played in a summer concert series inside the Pavilion\u2019s Tent Of Tomorrow. \nCirca 1964\nBy the early 70's, it had already been neglected for almost a decade when a young couple from Cleveland came upon it and decided to turn the building into a roller skating rink.  By 1975, as the city spiraled into economic crisis, they were kicked out and Philip Johnson's pavilion was left virtually untouched for almost 40 years. \nMitch Silverstein & John Piro (The Painters of the Pavilion)\nIn 2009 a group of fair goers, led by John Piro and Mitch Silverstein, decided to take matters in their own hands by sprucing up the Pavilion with a fresh coat of paint.  This has helped to spark national interest in the New York State Pavilion, as well as a desire to develop an adaptive reuse for the structure. \nThe Vintage Robot T-Shirt\nPhil Buehler is a huge fan of modern ruins and the New York State Pavilion.

Even a small contribution will go a long way in making this project great.  \nThe film is already in post production but I need this funding to secure the necessary post production processing of the final cut, to bring you the best film possible.  This includes acquiring music and archival footage/photographs, image licensing, audio mastering, and DVD replication and packaging.  \nSince February of 2013 I have conducted almost 2 dozen interviews with authors, historians, architects, architectural critics, fair goers, post-fair concert goers, the operators of the roller skating rink and many more interesting individuals. I have traveled across the country and criss-crossed the New York Metropolitan area documenting their experiences in an effort to preserve the rich story of this visible ruin.\nWorking on this film has been an incredible experience due largely to the overwhelming support I have received over the past year.  The film is truly the product of a community effort and the generosity of many who are passionate about learning more about this building and seeing it put back to good use.\nPeople have donated money, time, photos, home movies, and so much more to help this film become a success.\nAny amount you can contribute is greatly appreciated, and by backing this project, you are making a statement about how you feel about the historical and future importance of the New York State Pavilion.\nCheck out the rewards in the panel to the right, and consider becoming a backer of this project.

I wonder what the moment would have been like - the people, the food, the smells. As with a time machine, photographs allow us to see directly into the past to experience a moment in time.\nPhotographers like Carlton Watkins, Edward Muybridge, and Ansel Adams among others, used the camera as a vehicle to show their love of place. Each of them worked in large format to get the sharpest, finest prints available at the time. I have been using a 4x5\u201d film camera for over 25 years. Recently I have chosen to go back in time to an early photographic technology\u2014that of wet plate collodion. \nWhat is wet collodion?\nThe following video gives an overview of the wet collodion process.\nCollodion can be used on glass to make negatives or on tin to make tintypes.  I plan to make both as part of this project.\nThe Project\nMy project will involve making a small, but powerful, body of images of the Northern California Coast using 12x20\" glass negatives and wet collodion. From these mammoth negatives, I will print directly on to albumen silver paper, resulting in stunning prints. At 150 times the size of a 35mm negative, the resolution is unsurpassed, allowing the viewer to visually step in to the photograph. How spectacular to be able to continue the tradition started in 1851 by early photographers and share these unique images for many years to come.\nThe Plan\nClick to see project's regional scope.\nI plan to visit at least ten locations between Monterey and Mendocino, and make several images in each location.  I have the fortunate ability to take my darkroom with me, as I have converted a travel trailer to allow me to make images wherever my truck and trailer can take me.  I will update you on where I have been or plan to go, and may post some of the images from time to time.  The more funding the project gets, the more places I can go.  Once the campaign reaches $5,000, or the project book level sells out, I will publish a book of select images, which will be sent to those who have contributed at each level that identifies a project book as a reward in the description.  A tour of my darkroom and ability to make a tintype yourself is even offered as a reward.\nThe Reality\nMaking collodion negatives and albumen prints can be quite costly. Beyond the cost of equipment, chemistry is expensive and each sheet of glass or plexiglass for the negative and each sheet of paper for printing can cost more than developing an entire roll of 35 mm film.  From start to finish, a 12x20\" albumen print costs roughly $18. The negatives and prints are delicate and can break, scratch and spoil.  The chemistry, waste and time can add up quickly.  Contributions will be used to offset these photographic costs, as well as travel costs associated with the project.  The $5,000 campaign only begins to cover the expenses, so I encourage you to contribute at any level and spread the word!  Every bit counts, and is so very much appreciated.\nStretch Goals  \nWhile I have set my campaign at $5,000, I would love to raise at least double that amount.  With additional funds, I can expand the project by visiting more locations and producing more beautiful images.  I might even be able to buy additional lenses for my camera.

Making a negative plate is an extremely time-consuming process and can be quite costly. Each negative plate has to be coated, sensitized, and exposed within the 10-15 minutes that the collodion is wet, or else the collodion hardens and the negative becomes unusable. Collodion is not like conventional film-because of the process and time involved. Each plate is totally unique, which in my opinion is one of the things that makes this such a rewarding art form. It can take half a day to get one good plate. I am thankful to have a supportive family that will allow me the time necessary to produce a beautiful body of work. I have a lot of patience and determination, and with over 30 years of experience in photography, I am confident this project will yield strong imagery that many will be able to enjoy.\nShould fulfillment get delayed, I will make sure to stay in touch with my supporters and keep them abreast as to what is going on and why.

I'm Scott Rivers and, well, I love to sing.  I've been singing for as long as I can remember.  I've been told that I even would sing in my sleep when I was a kid.  Not that any of you needed to know that. My first real solo, however, was when I was about 16.  The song was called Worthy To Enter and it changed my perspective on music.  You see this song was a prayer to God.  It was a prayer to God to make me worthy to enter his house and His presence.  Never had I felt such peace as I did while singing that song.  The feeling that came from sharing the Lord's message was so wonderful that I wanted to continue to do so as much as possible.\nNow the time has finally come to record that album.  I feel like the time is right.  I have a wonderful musician working on the arrangements.  His name is Jared Pierce.  \nJared has performed all over the world including Europe, South America, throughout the United States. As a collaborative pianist, Mr. Pierce has worked with hundreds of singers, instrumentalists, and numerous choirs.

He received his M.M. degree in piano performance from Brigham Young University and his B.M. from California State University, Stanislaus.\nSo needless to say the creative portion of the album is in excellent hands.\nI got to record my single at Soularium Recording Studios in Alpine, UT.  They were awarded Best Recording Studio in the State of Utah for 2013.  Their client list includes many big names including Disney, the Osmonds, and Air Supply, just to name a few.  So once again the quality of recording that is produced here is top notch.\nI was able to record the first song a few months ago at Soularium.  This is the song heard in the background of the above video.  To listen to the full version of this song visit http://www.scottdrivers.com/music\nSo I'm asking you to get behind me, so that I can create something uplifting and beautiful to give to the world. Because of the high quality of talent that I am enlisting to create this album, the cost is going to be higher as well.  The money that you back me with will go towards the arranging, recording, mixing, and mastering the album as well as album artwork, marketing and the distribution.\nAny money that is raised above the goal will go to making the album even better, with better studios and engineers, more studio time, more marketing and better distribution, etc.\nI'm excited and thankful to have you on board as I take a big leap into this big musical world.\nScott Rivers\nlimited edition geometric intaglio print.\nlimited edition minimalist intaglio print.\nAn example of the hand bound journal/sketchbook(color options available)\n Composer Jared Pierce\nComposer Jared Pierce\nJared Pierce is one of Utah\u2019s rising generation of engaging, versatile, and entertaining pianists and composers.

Don't let it's size fool you, though. We've designed this stylish wallet to hold everything you\u2019ll need - from as little as a single card to over 10 cards plus cash, receipts and more. The easy-access thumb slot makes swiping your most frequently used cards a breeze, and when not in use, the SLIMplistic leaves an almost unseen imprint in either your front or back pocket.\nWe\u2019ve taken the SLIMplistic as far as we possibly could on our own, and have now turned to our fellow Kickstarters for the support needed to fund and begin production. Your pledge will help us get one step closer to reaching our minimum goal of $5,000, allowing us to meet minimum production requirements, which then enables us to offer you the SLIMplistic Wallet at an affordable price.\nWith your pledge, you\u2019ll receive a SLIMplistic Wallet in the color of your choice. Colors available include either black or brown, with stretch goals of at least 3 more additional colors (green, blue & red). You\u2019ll also have your choice of choosing which logo embossment you prefer - plain (no color), silver, gold or black.\nThank you for taking the time to learn about the SLIMplistic, and thank you for your pledge. Your support is essential to making this project a reality and we couldn\u2019t do this without YOU!\nTake a look below to see the key features that make this one-of-a-kind wallet a step above the rest, as well as to see our Stretch Goals, where everyone wins!\nFeatures\nSUPER THIN\nOnly 1/8\u201d of an inch (.125\u201d inch) thick -- The same height as 2 quarters laying flat on top of each other -- making it both comfortable, and barely noticeable in either your front or back pocket.\nTOP VIEW - Loaded with 6 credit cards and 4 paper bills.\nSIDE VIEW - Loaded with 6 credit cards and 4 paper bills.\nBACK VIEW - Loaded with 6 credit cards and 4 paper bills.\nWhich would you rather sit on?\nSUPER LIGHTWEIGHT\nIt weighs ONLY .4oz -- Yes, less than half of one ounce, the same weight as just 2 quarters! Again adding comfort-ability while keeping it barely noticeable in any pocket.\nSUPER STYLISH\nWith all edges tucking and rolling into each other, no detail was over looked, keeping it aesthetically clean, simple, balanced and modern.\nSUPER CONVENIENT\nThe easy-slide ergonomic thumb slot is perfect for quickly accessing your most frequently used cards and essential for quick-swipe capability.\nSUPER SECURE\nUnlike other \u201cslim\u201d or \u201cminimalist\u201d wallets, which leave some or all of your wallet\u2019s content exposed, we keep it all tucked away. The center-panel recessed-notch gives you access to press all of your cards easily, and securely into place below flush at the top, as well as access to remove the inner most cards with ease.\nSUPER DURABLE\nMade from the finest Italian leather, utility nylon fabric, and locally woven custom elastic, the SLIMplistic was intently designed with longevity in mind, capable of enduring the tests of even the most extreme lifestyles.\nSUPER VERSATILE\nThis wallet is capable of holding as much or as little as you need. It securely holds anywhere from 1-15 cards, as well as cash, receipts, keys, or anything else you can imagine you\u2019d need from your wallet.\nSUPERB QUALITY\nNot only is it made from the finest materials, it\u2019s also manufactured right here at home, locally, by the finest leather workers. 100% designed, handcrafted and made in the USA.\n\nOur Process & Progress\nDon\u2019t let its simple, sleek, design fool you. Over 8 months of designing, prototyping, product testing as well as an immeasurable amount of thoughtful planning went into refining and redesigning the wallet you see today.\nLike many projects, the idea for the SLIMplistic Wallet came from necessity \u2013 a search for a problem that didn\u2019t seem to yield a suitable solution \u2013 until now. One day we were just hanging out and somehow stumbled upon discussing how large and ridiculously fat our wallets were. We had quite a few laughs as we pulled them out comparing their sizes. This prompted us to look into solutions available online. And yes, there are options out there for smaller wallets, but all of them had at least one fatal flaw, making them completely unsuitable in our eyes.\n\nMost of the wallets that claimed to be \u201cslim,\u201d either leave your cash exposed, a portion of your cards exposed, are difficult to use, or limit how much you can or can\u2019t hold.\n\nOur mission at this point was simple: Design something that is classy, slim, practical/easily accessible, fully encases all your cards and cash, and at the same time can expand to hold as much or as little as you need. The seed was planted and it was time to start sketching and testing some designs.\nIt started with some collaborative brainstorming and about 10 sketches. From there it was time to gather supplies and make some homemade prototypes.\nAfter making and testing the various designs that made the most sense, we whittled down the list to a single superior design, which we then began to refine.\nOnce we reworked and tested our prototype, we took our idea to a local manufacturer who we\u2019ve partnered up with to help further fine-tune our wallet. Working together hand-in-hand, we\u2019ve experimented with alternative materials and different techniques.\nAfter roughly half a dozen more tweaks, improving the SLIMplistic's performance in addition to making it production friendly, we\u2019ve completed the prototype process, product testing, and brought us to where we are today.\nFinal Design/Construction Process\n\nOur Manufacturing Plan \u2013 The Next Step & Beyond\nWe are now ready to take the next step forward and begin production. Once successfully funded, we will be able to purchase all the materials and final tooling needed to produce the SLIMplistic on a large enough scale to fulfill your pledge rewards as promised. Our manufacturer already houses all the materials and equipment needed to begin and complete the job, so there will be no lead-time needed in this area. We\u2019ve been given a conservative estimate of 2 weeks to complete our first production run. As we\u2019ve mentioned a couple times throughout this campaign, the leather shop we are working with has been around for over 40 years, is family owned, and are a great group of people. We couldn\u2019t ask for anyone more qualified to bring this project to life.\nWe will begin production as soon as we meet our initial goal of $5,000. At this time we will also order our packaging for your wallets. We\u2019ve been given a 10-day lead-time on the delivery of the packaging from our local print house (who we\u2019ve used before on other projects), which means we should have the packaging in-hand several days before the wallets themselves. As we receive the wallets they will be inspected for quality control, and packaged. Once our campaign comes to a close, and funds are transferred, we will immediately ship you your wallet/rewards!\nTake a peek into just one of the rooms that houses some of the machines that will be used in the production of your wallet:\nJust a few of the many sewing machines available.\nOh yeah, here are a few more.\nOne of the dies used on the pneumatic press for our prototypes.\nHere is the die of our logo and the press used to emboss it.\nBecause of you and your pledge, our future is bright and we plan on continuing to offer the SLIMplistic Wallet online through our website. Once all of your rewards are fulfilled and shipped, we will begin production of our website, MSTRMNDcollective.com.\nStretch Goals\nDon't get us wrong, we're not trying to be cocky, and we'll be ecstatic if we reach our minimum goal... But with a potential opportunity to over-fund our project, we'd love to show our extreme gratitude to our backers. So, as an extra THANK YOU and incentive for you to share our project with your friends and family, everyone who pledges will be eligible to receive these extra rewards!\nStretch Goal: $10,000\nAll pledges receive MSTRMND key chain (up-cycled from your actual wallet!)\nStretch Goal: $15,000\nAll pledges receive a MSTRMND sticker pack (4 stickers)\nStretch Goal: $25,000 - Unlock Color: Kickstarter/Envy Green\nStretch Goal: $30,000 - Unlock Color: Pretty Pink\nStretch Goal: $35,000 - Unlock Color: Bright Blue\nStretch Goal: $40,000 - Unlock Color: Cool White\nStretch Goal: $45,000 - Unlock Color: Rich Red\nThese and more stretch goal Fem-freindly colors to come!\n\nThank you!\nWe\u2019re extremely confident that everything will go off without a hitch and we will keep all of you up-to-date with emails on the status of your SLIMplistic Wallet.

Head over to thepowerpot.com for more info and to place an order.\n\nHow Fast Are You Charging?\nIt's more common than you think. You plug in your phone, it says 'charging', but do you know how fast? Millions of people deal with slow charge times from their PCs or laptops, and they don't even realize it. Slow charging rates happen because of different standards for high-powered USB and can result in charge times exceeding six hours! We are introducing the Practical Meter to help you solve these slow charge times.\nKnow Your Power\nSmartphones have become an essential part of our lives. Keeping them charged is more important than ever, but today's phones often die before the day is through. This makes charging at top-speed mandatory. Currently, there is no way to know if your phone is charging fast or slow. The Practical Meter changes this. It displays real-time charge rates of any USB device so you know how fast you're charging.\nDo you ever use a PC/computer to charge at work or home? Let's plug in the Practical Meter and find out how quickly it charges an iPhone.  Using the factory cable, we only get 2.5 watts. This is only 50% of the max charging speed, which means this phone will take 4+ hours to charge! Plug the same setup into a Mac and now it behaves like it should, charging in 1.5 hours at top speed (5 watts).\nAndroid Too\nThe same thing happens with most Android models on both Macs and PCs. This is because there are different standards for putting a full 5-watts into a USB device. iPhone has its own standard, Android uses another and so on.\nTo solve this we developed a 3-in-1 charging cable, that optimizes charge times with iPhone, Android as well as Mini USB.\nRewards: Charge Faster!\nNote: Single orders ONLY. You can order additional units after we fund.\nStretch Goals\nUse It Everywhere\nThe Practical Meter helps you know your power with no added cables and no engineering degree required! Plug it into any USB port and charge the same way as before. Watch your power output change from one device to the next.\nPortable Generators\nUnsurprisingly portable USB chargers like solar panels and battery packs also have their share of compatibility issues. A common example is shown in the video, when poor positioning reduces power to less than one-watt. Smartphones may indicate they are charging but the Practical Meter tells us that they aren't receiving any power. This can be solved by repositioning your solar panel and using the Practical Meter to find the sweet spot.\nKeep Charging!\nOur 3-in-1 charging tip maximizes power draw to help you charge faster. Use it on any USB port to ensure your phone is charging at top speed.\nLet's visit our previous example, we charge an iPhone on a PC and get charge times exceeding 4 hours. We switch out the factory cable with ours and voila! The charge rate doubles, and our charge time is now under 2 hours!\nTech Details\nThe Practical Meter fits into any USB port and displays the charge rate of any device. Just plug it in and charge as you normally would. Smartphones charge at 5-watts max, so we added 5 LED lights, each representing 1 watt of power.\nWhen all five bars are lit, your phone will charge at top speed, between 1 and 2 hours. If the meter only shows 2 or 3 watts, you'll be waiting for up to 6 hours for your phone to charge. Knowing your power will help you maximize charge times by choosing the best charging cables for your device. \nThe Practical Meter uses a microcontroller to read the output data from a current sensor.  It averages this measurement over a few seconds and illuminates the number of LEDs corresponding to the measured power using the relation: Power = Voltage x Current. This design gives you simple real-time visual feedback while charging your devices. The Practical Meter meter itself weighs 0.3 ounces (8.5 g) and consumes less than 1/10 of a watt at maximum.  The optimized charging tips are for charging only and do not allow data transfer. However, the Practical Meter by itself will allow you to transfer data so you can monitor power use while transferring music or pictures. \nHigh Power Mode allows you to measure up to 10 watts for higher powered devices such as iPads and tablets.\nPress Kit\nCheck out our Press Kit. Pictures can be reused freely on any medium.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Practical Meter's beauty is its simplicity. You don't need to know about voltages and amperage to understand how much power you're getting. We've done a lot of leg work to make sure things go smoothly once our project funds. Its been prototyped and revised several times and is ready for mass production. We have manufacturing arranged, but to meet minimum order and tooling costs, we need your help.

Our manufacturing partner is a wonderful woman named Melissa who we have worked with on other projects in the past. Her quality is outstanding and she manufactures kitchen products for some of the top brands like Alessi, Oxo, and Prepara. It is important to us that we collaborate at each stage of the project with established professionals we can rely on. \n\nThis is our first time shipping goods ourselves. Usually we do the design work, verify the quality of the production and then the boats, planes, trains and trucks are all up to other people. In order to protect the project from rookie mistakes, we are partnering with industry leader DHL for the transport of the goods from the factory to the distribution center in Los Angeles. \n\nThis distribution centre is part of the Shipwire network and our new best friend Steve at Shipwire is going to hold our hand through each stage of getting the rewards shipped out in a timely and organized fashion.

(photo coming soon)\n All of the above plus a digital double of your own face!\nArmature Pair + Digital Illustration Class\nArmature Pair + 3D Printing Class\nMore pictures coming (Will be posting pictures for each reward)\nHey Kickstarter community! \nI reaaaalllly want to get this cool little figure I made into the hands of retailers, but they won't pay me any attention until I can prove I can manufacture them in large quantities and be able to do so quickly. So what do you think? Can a 3D printed product get into retail stores? \nI believe the answer is yes but first let me tell you about this cool product and then my plan to get there. You're probably familiar with those wooden unisex dolls in craft stores for artists, right?  You know, the ones with those funny looking ball joints? Well, haven't you wished they made them with the proper proportions and range of motion? Yes? Well so did I, and that's what I set off to do. \nAfter many months of design, 3D printing and iteration, and a thorough four month beta phase with over 800 armature shipped around the world. I've finally come up with a design that has been tested and proven and a production and shipping pipeline well established.\nThis figure, has been designed to simply and accurately portray the human anatomical proportion with a range of motion capable of posing it realistically. Unlike the wooden dolls that are currently out in the market, these, are way more accurate and are better suited to meet the needs of artists and, in fact, has already had positive impacts on my own art.\nThrough this kickstarter I'm releasing the new, 2013 version of the design and also a number of new products and enhancements such as quadrupeds, a 1-1 hand armature, various proportional and anatomical variations and more!\nSo why help me out? The thing is, I've been manufacturing these myself with 3D printers and as you can imagine, it's painfully slow. Right now I can produce about 10 of the large armatures a day, which does not including assembly or possible failure-rate (there's good days and bad days).  Consequently, there's little to no hope of getting it into retail storefronts, as they need to be assured they can order 100-200 on a moment's notice.\nGetting this product into retail stores is the only way this armatures will get the exposure it really needs in order to thrive and become the livelihood I need it to be in order to put food on the table.   If I make my goal, I can raise enough money to expand my equipment and include ten (10) 3D printers, With these I'd be able to produce 50 armatures a day! This kind of output will allow me to meet the initial needs of retail stores in addition to online orders.\nIn exchange for your support, I'm offering many of these armatures at a 25% discount (even over %50 if you get the $200 bundle) and even offering some armatures that will never be available through retail OR my website (such as the 5.5\" armature). Meeting this kickstarter goal will allow me to add the additional printers to my arsenal and pay for the materials and shipment of the rewards you pledge on. My time would be unpaid and would constitute my contribution to the campaign. I'll be handling all the printing, assembly, shipping and the package design for retailers.\nPlease support my grassroots attempt to manufacture this product. Even if you're not an artist, any of these rewards would make a great gift for any artist friends you have.\nSpecial Note:\nOnly those that contribute to this campaign will get their armatures in this limited edition color (pearl & crimson). If you prefer the default brown with dark trim, you can opt out of this choice by saying so in the comments (but you can't back out after you do). The pearl color, uses little to no pigmentation and so it is slightly translucent (similar to skin & marble, so it will provide you with more realistic shading when doing your value samples)\nTo learn more about how to use these armatures for illustration, watch the video listed at the top.\nCredits: \nMusic by Mariya Lincoln & DjembeDJ\nFilmed by Kevin Harris\nNote: I Photoshoped away the background because it had a nasty texture to it", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI launched a crowd-funding campaign to release a Beta version of this product late last year with over 800 armatures ordered: (http://www.indiegogo.com/armature9)\n\nI was very thorough and transparent with my fulfillment of orders by providing this public spreadsheet to all contributors so they could track my progress:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArJsKv5h1IsCdFJCN2QyUUh5N1lselJCWURwVjQxQ1E&usp=sharing\n\n\nAnd I learned a TON! I faced a number of unexpected issues and learned how to resolve them. As a consequence, I established a sustainable and efficient production and assembly pipeline. Am in the process of solidifying a relationship with a filament supplier. Found an excellent technician to help me with repair issues. Resolved a number of design problems based on feedback I got from customers. Registered with a bulk mailing service and learned how to assemble and package the armatures efficiently. I learned an incredible amount about manufacturing with 3D printers in general and how to get consistent repeatable and non-brittle results. \n\nIn short, I've really crossed my t's and dotted my i's so that I could launch this much larger campaign. So I see very little risk to you, the contributor. I'm sure, however, I will continue to learn new things, once, and if, you help me get my foot in the door of retailers.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #60", "update_userinfo": "Important: Last Update for Armature Nine", "update_content": "Happy new year everyone!

There are no inexpensive mobile robot bases big enough to hold widgets sized to do real work.\nButler answers that need. Robot designers will no longer have to keep reinventing the wheel(s).\nI have been designing and building robots for 20 years at companies such as RedZone Robotics, iRobot, and Harvest Automation. The idea for Butler came about when I noticed that smartphones with their built-in sensors, and ever more powerful micros like Arduino, Raspberry PI, and the Beaglebone Black, were being used for robot brains for much less cost than it takes to design, build, and test a custom electronics board and integrate sensors. This advantage opens the doors for a much larger community of robot developers because it reduces design effort, risk, and cost. What is missing though, is a low cost robot base big enough to hold large contraptions, robot arms, lift-tables, large monitors, follow-me grocery cart, whatever you want to be mobile.\nWhether you are a hacker, maker, hobbyist, parent of a budding young roboticist, teacher, professor, researcher, or engineer you will find that it provides a useful tool that will save you money and speed up the development of your robot idea. Butler has simple attachment points and is strong enough to carry anything you want to put on it.\nParaphrasing A Roadmap for U.S. Robotics From Internet to Robotics 2013 Edition: \u201crapid progress toward the goal of deploying mobile and dexterous robots in human environments to enable coexistence and cooperation will critically depend on the broad availability of adequate research infrastructure, including hardware and software.\u201d\nButler is a major part of that hardware and will make it faster, simpler, and cheaper for robot developers like you to design and test new robotic applications that provide real value in homes, offices, and work sites, so that the robot revolution can finally take off!\nDescription\nButler is about a 20 inches wide and 8 inches to the top of the platform. It travels at walking speed, and is steered with the now-classic robot steering method called differential steering (also tank steer or skid steer). The back end of the roughly triangular shaped chassis is supported by a low rolling resistance non-marking caster. A bit of trivia: The Butler logo and the shape of the chassis is based on a Reuleaux triangle, a \"Curve of Constant Width\".\nThere are brackets under the chassis to hold two 7 amp-hour 12VDC PowerSonic 1270 lead acid AGM batteries. This battery chemistry was chosen because it is low cost, simple to charge, and robust. Batteries are not included because they would cost too much to ship. It is up to you buy, install, and connect the batteries to Butler using the simple spade lugs on the batteries. There is a convenient screw terminal strip to connect the batteries, cliff sensors, and the motor controller to your micro. The strip also has 5VDC, 12VDC, and 24VDC outputs.\nThe gearmotors are equipped with quadrature encoders that provide about 1/8\u201d position resolution at the ground, and with more than 50 inch-lbs of torque per wheel will easily move heavy loads. Butler has a simple set of mounting holes designed to make it as easy as possible to attach whatever you want, anywhere you want on the chassis.\nThe chassis has a cliff detector in front of each wheel to prevent driving off steps, and motor current sensors for both motors. Also included is a powerful RoboClaw motor driver that can provide closed loop speed control. Butler can drive anywhere indoors (except stairs), and also outside on pavement, grass, and gravel.\nHigh level control of and communications to your widget is handled by your smartphone, tablet, or laptop, lower level stuff like not driving off a step can be handled by any of the many available microcontrollers (Arduino, Spark Core, Hydra, LPC mbed, Phidget, Propellor, PIC, Raspberry PI, STAMP, Beaglebone, etc.). It is assumed you will write your control code as an app on your smartphone, but nothing prevents you from using a micro by itself, or even a tablet or laptop strapped to the top of Butler that talks directly to whatever you have attached to Butler, and to the RoboClaw motor controller via the screw terminal strip.\nWhat the funding will pay for\nYou can be part of this revolution! Any amount pledged to this campaign is gratefully appreciated, not only by me, but by those who will use Butler. The funds I make from this campaign will pay for parts and materials for at least 15 Butlers in various versions. This quantity will reduce cost due to volume discounts. I will make every effort to minimize the cost of Butler and build as many as I can from whatever funds are raised.\nNon-financial help will be welcomed when Butler goes into production, but it takes money to get to that point! Thanks in advance. If you can\u2019t contribute, that doesn't mean you can\u2019t help. Please share this campaign with your friends on Facebook and twitter, and with your contacts who you think might be interested in this project.\nHere is a high level breakdown of what the money will pay for.\nChassis parts and materials for 15 Butlers, plus spares.\nSheet metal fabrication and 3D grown parts\nStorage racks to hold all those parts\nAssembly and test Labor\nPackaging\nShipping\nSeveral versions of Butler will be made. The Basic version is just the chassis with wheels, gearmotors, and encoders. The fully equipped Butler has 6 sensors, the screw terminal strip, and the motor controller. If we make a stretch goal of $45,000 I will add a Spark Core version of Butler and hire someone to write robot behaviors for the Arduino in the Core. A larger version of Butler with bigger wheels and more powerful motors is also planned.\nStatus, When, and Where\nButler is loosely based on early prototypes of Harvest Automation\u2019s HV-100 robot, all of which I designed and built, but is far simpler. I was part of the effort to turn the HV-100 prototypes into product and then shipping them, so I have experience with that part of the process also.\nThe picture below shows the prototype I built to confirm that critical features were properly sized. Things like caster and drive wheel(s) diameter and width (a compromise of rolling resistance, overall width, mobility, weight, cost, torque loads); and platform height, length, and width (again a compromise: the goal was to be as big as possible but still easily fit thru interior doorways, be easy to carry preferably with one hand, not so tall that it tips over, etc.) were evaluated.\nThe prototype was lighter than the sheet metal production version will be, so I added weight to it for mobility testing.The small caster turned out to cause mobility issues on some surfaces and terrains, hence the larger caster on the production version. The prototype had a simpler motor driver which mounted was on top as shown, but to leave the top clean, I mounted the RoboClaw motor driver underneath.\nButler carrying the first version of Roomba!\nI am finishing up the details of the production version of Butler in my home office in Brookline, NH.

Finally, we believe we got it right. Below is a brief journal of our adventures:\nApparel Folding Industry\nWe were so happy to learn that folding machines have existed for decades already. They just are too big and expensive to be used in laundromats and homes.\nBrainstorming for an alternative\nWe researched the current folding solutions and realized that folding garments is not a small challenge. Fabric is very difficult to manipulate in a consistent way using a machine. (When you apply force to a garment in one direction it doesn't necessarily move to the required direction)\nAlso, we had to come up with a small enough design that would fit in stores and later households. On top of making it very easy and enjoyable to use.\nFoldiMate 9000 POC\nThe winning concept of our brainstorming sessions was then built as a basic prototype to experiment and test it's behavior with garments.\nFoldiMate 9000 Alpha\nSatisfied with the POC results we proceeded to create a fully automatic prototype while reaching out to potential customers and testing out FoldiMate 9000 viability in different scenarios.\nFoldiMate 5000 POC\nWe then brainstormed again for a better and more suitable design (smaller, cheaper, easy to use, versatile) and came up with a way to fold using only a rotating rod and a simple measurement tape both of which you can buy at your local home depot store.\nAfter playing with drills and tapes for a while - fun ;-), we started building a prototype in Ted's garage that will prove it can actually fold clothes as we envisioned and tested it successfully with different types of tops from bike jerseys to sweaters to sweatshirts.\nFoldiMate 5000 Alpha I (in testing)\nWhen Robert came to Ted's garage one day and saw the POC, he immediately said \"I can do it better and manufacturable!\" and jumped on board by joining the founding team. \nTogether we designed and built FoldiMate 5000 Alpha I in Robert's workshop in Berkeley, which currently goes through daily tests and design improvements. \nFoldiMate 5000 Alpha II  (in progress)\nAlpha I tests shows us we're on the right track. Based on our key learnings thus far we decided to manufacture an improved version of Alpha I which we'll take with us to the largest laundry industry trade show, The Clean Show @ June 20th in New Orleans booth #5255, come and pay us a visit.\nFoldiMate 5000 Beta\nBased on extensive tests we'll perform with Alpha I/II and with the support of the Kickstarter community, we'll manufacture 25 units to our early backers and work closely with them to improve the FoldiMate experience before we mass produce it.\n2014 - FoldiMate 5000\nRobotic technology for the appliance industry, FoldiMate 5000 is our first commercial version geared for self use in coin laundromats and businesses.\nEASY\nJust place an item, press a button, and receive it professionally folded.\nNo training needed, anyone can use it.\nVERSATILE\nCan fold shirts of almost any type (long/short sleeve) XS to XXL, towels and pants.\nCOMPACT\nA 1/3 of a washer, just put it on a table and start FoldiMateing\nFAST\nFoldiMateing clothes will take a 1/2 of manual folding time\nSpecs\n- Footprint: 25\"W / 28\"L / 29\"H \n- Weight: ~55lbs\n- Voltage: 110/200V\n- Speed: ~250 items/hr\n- Compatible with existing coins or card solutions\n* Beta units will fold shirts and then, we will send our backers software updates which will teach FoldiMate to fold more items\nFUTURE - FoldiMate 800\nWith additional resources and your support (read more below), we will be able to develop FoldiMate 800, a folding machine for our homes. \nGiven the evolution and experience we'll gain with FoldiMate 5000, the 800 unit would be smaller, better and most importantly, we estimate the retail price to be less than $1500 depending on demand & volume.\nThe FoldMates\nAn exceptional team with more than 30 years of experience in innovation, robotics, design and manufacturing.\nGal Rozov (CEO) >15yrs software architect and CTO\nTed Selker (CTO) >30yrs of innovation.

Ordering in volume batches will result in a significant discount and will allow us to fully hire our wonderful team in order to boost the final fine tuning of the beta and the testing.\n* This is why we hope to exceed our funding goal and have many more FoldiMate 5000 units shipped to our backers who will directly fund our high R&D, tooling and compliance costs\nYOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE\nWe need your vote of confidence so FoldiMate could reach your local store and home faster than ever.

It stretches in any direction unlike most wallets made with elastic band, which stretches in only one direction. It is complimented with a leather front side for a durable QuickDraw slot.\nSwipe, without ever taking your card out.\nWHY JOIN TEAM DASH?\nDASH 2.0 is the perfect size to carry everything you need.\nIt has been redesigned with more durable materials.\nEveryone has one favorite card to use; DASH 2.0 will give you instant access to it.\nYou can use this card without ever having to take it out of your wallet.\nIn some instances, you won\u2019t be able to use cards, so Dash carries cash.\nPricing starts at only $12 for early birds. That's like the price of lunch these days.\nIt's light; less than a quarter ounce.\nYour clothes will fit better.\nThey can fit in any pocket or purse.\nThey are great for holding ID cards and RFID.\nThey can better organize and distribute business cards.\nEveryday life can be chaotic. Perhaps this could help make it a bit simpler.\nHelp make loved ones' everyday lives simpler by gifting one.\nStory:\nLast year, I designed DASH Wallets after my new pup destroyed my old, traditional wallet. The project was fortunately funded and we started production. Afterwards, we received a lot of feedback and advice from you guys, on a better wallet design. Taking every single backer's feedback into consideration, I was inspired to create DASH 2.0.\nThat's the great thing about Kickstarter. Backers and creators can collaborate to create better products together. So thank you, Kickstarters.\nAfter launching the first Dash project, I was able to learn a lot more about the many aspects of crowdfunding. We've been working to improve every step along the way from production costs to shipment methods. This time around, backer rewards can be offered for an even more affordable pledge and the process of fulfillment will be much more streamlined.\nDesign:\nDash 2.0 Wallets are made of a newer, more durable elastic fabric. It stretches in all directions as opposed to other wallets with elastic band, which moves in only one direction. \nIt was created with such elasticity so that you can hold however much you need. The 2.0 features black or (stretch goal) brown leather to compliment the black fabric for an upscale version of the original Dash. Using leather, the cutout for the quickdraw slot is more resilient to fraying and wear.\nProduction:\nAfter launching the original DASH, we are ready to create this second line with more durable materials at a lower cost. We've spent months improving and developing this wallet based on your input, so we think you'll really like it. \nYour Support:\nThis is where Kickstarter comes in again. We need your support to launch this line of wallets. We are raising funding for manufacturing, packaging, and logistics for DASH 2.0. Your support for the production of these wallets will help to make everyday life a little less complicated. Thank you for taking the time to check out the project.\nSharing it with loved ones takes only a second, and it would mean the world to us.

However, I did see the 'Most Rad' and 'Articulate' wallets and wondered if the QD on those wallets might be adversely affected by the thickness of the leather used. Don't know why I didn't translate that to this project. But again, my only mild disappointment for Dash 2.0 stems from the looseness of the Quickdraw pocket and how it slightly affects the function of the QD, but I don't know if that's due to the quality of the material and/or the width and height of the material used. My guess is that cost played a big part in the selection of this material, but there may have been some elasticity considerations as well (i.e., maybe a thicker leather would have limited the 'ease of slide' of the card and/or limited the number of cards able to fit in the pocket).", "time": "almost 8 years ago"}, {"username": "Sterling Fountain", "content": "To achieve perfection, one must constantly improve.

I think the issue is that the pictures were deceiving because most, if not all, depicted an expanded wallet with cards inside. I don't recall any pictures of a crumbled up soft sided wallet showing the elastic layers. When I, and probably most, think of a wallet, I don't think of something that is flimsy, unstructured, and outside layers constructed of elastic. I think of a structured all leather outside with minimal or no elastic used in between, and something that doesn't flap in the wind. I never would have guessed from the pictures that the leather was paper thin and the wallet could be rolled up like a silk sunglass case. Part of crowd funding is taking a leap and hoping you land firmly on the ground. Such was not the case for me on this venture, and I'm not pleased with this purchase.

Head over to our NEW website now.\nFor business inquires such as licensing, retail partnerships, and distribution; please email us at partnerships@windcatchergear.com\nClick HERE to sign up for NEW Product ALERTS. When we start selling Air Pads of different sizes and shapes, and when we announce future innovations, you'll be the first to know!\nFacebook: WindcatcherGear\nTwitter: @WindcatcherGear\n*****************************************************************\nFeatured In\n**** UPDATE ****************\nThis is about more than an (awesome) Air Pad\nAfter going to the Kickstarter Project Jam, I realized we never really described our goal behind this Kickstarter. To us, supporting this Kickstarter is about more than buying an (awesome) Air Pad. You're supporting an entirely new type of technology that has the potential to inspire new ideas and future innovative products.\nIdeas like\n\u2022 Huge, reusable rescue buoys-- inflated by scooping up the air outside a fast moving helicopter, for marking the location of survivors in the water, when conditions prevent smoke signals from being used effectively\n\u2022 Inflatable tents and dome structures\n\u2022 Inflatable backboards for rapidly evacuating an injured person from the field\n\u2022 Huge inflatable lake/sea structures for utilitarian and recreational use; inflated by scooping up the air as a boat speeds forward.\nWe believe that the Air Pad and Air Bag are awesome and we'll work our asses off to make it the best freak'n product it can be. But it's just the beginning; just the tip of a giant inflatable iceberg all of you are helping to inflate.\nThanks again for your continued support!\n- Ryan, Rob, & Zeke\n***************************************************************************************\nThe Windcatcher Air Pad\nAdditional Features\nSanitary - The valve never touches your mouth\nQuiet - NO loud & obnoxious electric pumping noise\nRequires NO power\nRequires NO pumping\nOptional Accessory - The Windcatcher Air Bag easily turns the Air Pad into a chair perfect for reading, using an iPad, and more!\n** UPDATE: NEW VIDEO***********\nINDOORS DEMO- Inflation and deflation from start to finish (no cuts)\n*****************************************************************************\n\nHow Windcatcher Works\nIt looks like magic but it's really just science. Really really awesome science!\n\nEach time you blowing into the Windcatcher, the fast moving air stream from your mouth draws in the surrounding air; greatly amplifying your every breath.\n\nThe secret behind the Windcatcher's amazing speed of inflation is its ability to leverage the awesome properties of air. Simply put, the two most important properties are:\nFast moving air has lower air pressure than slow moving air\nAir with higher pressure will be drawn to areas of lower pressure\n\nWhen you blow into the Windcatcher you create a stream of fast moving, low pressure air. Because it has a higher air pressure, the surrounding air is sucked into the low pressure air stream. As a result, the air entering the Windcatcher is at least 10 to 15 times greater than the air you expelled from your lungs.\nHow is the Windcatcher Air Pad able to deflate so fast?\nBy designing a simple but highly effective valve for inflation, we were also able to greatly improve upon deflation as well. Our one of a kind one-way valve with invertible release, keeps the air in as you inflate, but also allows you to bypass the one-way valve for instant deflation.\nRewards\nFREE shipping within the US. Add $20 to ship outside the US.\nWindcatcher - Endless Possibilities\nWindcatcher Air Pad + Air Bag = AWESOME! Combining the Air Bag and Air Pad makes it perfect for using an iPad or reading. (For more info on the Air Bag, scroll to the bottom)\nOther mats and air pads are such a hassle to inflate and pack-up, they aren't practical to use for just an hour or less. However, the Windcatcher Air Pad inflates and also packs-up so quickly, its perfect for every occasion!\nOutdoor Fun\nCamping\nHiking\nTaking picnics on your lunch break\nImpromptu cloud watching between classes  \nStar gazing on your apartment's rooftop\nHaving a romantic evening out by the lake\nWatching the sunset (or rise) along the beach\nRelaxing at the park\nGetting a tan by the pool\nWaiting in line for the latest gadget (or The Colbert Report)\nTip- When going camping take the Windcatcher on your day hikes. This way you can use it whenever you feel like taking a break to enjoy the scenery.\n\n\nA picnic on your lunch break is a great way to unwind\n\n\nIndoor Adventures (and practical uses)\nCouch surfing around the country (or world)\nPower napping at work\nSplitting a hotel room\nUsing as a spare bed for an unexpected guest\nEmergency bedding at hurricane shelter (or relative's house)\nGreat if you ever get stuck at the airport\nGlovebox bedding- Too tired to drive home safe. Crash on your friend's floor instead.\n\nJust think of all the great ideas you'll have...after a quick power nap\n\n\n\nWindcatcher Air Pad Details/Specs\nNo need to mess with a stuff sack. To pack- just roll up and go!\n\nMaterial: 75D Ripstop Polyester internally laminated with Polyurethane \nInflated Size: 20 x 72 x 3.25 inches\nPack-up Size: 9 x 3.5 inches\nWeight: 24 oz/ 1.5 lbs (Final pad may be a few ounces lighter or heavier-- see manufacturing section below)\nR-Value: 1\n\nAdditional Features\nQuick Pack: Air Pad can be rolled up and secured with Velcro straps\nConventional Valve: For releasing air to adjust comfort (fullness)\nExtras Included: Stuff sack and repair kit\n\n\n\nWindcatcher Air Bag\nThe Air Bag easily transforms the Air Pad into a lounge chair. Perfect for playing games on your phone or just to see what's around you.\n\nHow to use the Windcatcher Air Bag\nThe Windcatcher Air Bag inflates, closes, and deflates just like the Air Pad. Once inflated, just unroll the tail section, so that it is under the center of the pad and lay down. Your own weight pressing against the tail section prevents the bag from moving, so no attachments are required.\nEasily transforms the Air Pad into a SWEET lounge chair!\nPerfect when reading, checking your phone, or watching the sunset\nCan be used both indoors and outside\nDoubles as a Dry Bag\n\n\nThe Windcatcher Story\nThere I was laying on the beach in Hawaii around Christmas time. After blowing two breaths of air into an inflatable raft/mat; and seeing what pitiful progress I had made, I decided laying directly on the beach was really my only choice. My brother; who now had a wife and kid to worry about, felt more compelled to inflate his own raft. As such, he continued this charade for another thirty seconds before ultimately giving up. Upon quitting, my brother looked down at the valve and said something to the effect of \"this is f----ing ridiculous\". As I laid there and listen to his words of wisdom, my mind raced with ideas about how........ oh, shave ice!\nManufacturing Plan\nThe money raised on Kickstarter will be used for the following\nPlace initial order with OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) - Because of setup cost, OEMs require you place large orders for custom air pads\nIn-house Equipment - Since we'll be making parts of the mattress ourselves, we'll need to purchase some basic equipment.\nMaterials - Like the air pads, no one lets you purchase just a couple yards of the material we use for the Windcatcher's valve (Our business partners were kind enough to provide us with free samples, so we could make a quality prototype)\nLabor - Depending how many we sell, we may need to hire a couple helpers to assemble and inspect the final product.\nOur plan is to have an experienced OEM produce the mattress for us, while we'll manufacture and the Windcatcher valves ourselves. The mattresses will be shipped to us, where we will integrate the Windcatcher's valve and necessary components into the mat. Because we will be finishing the product, we'll be able to inspect every last air pad before they ship out.\nWe have already received the necessary samples and quotes and have vendors and suppliers standing by. Once we have reached our Kickstarter goal, we intend to secure temporary financing to cover the cost of the initial orders. This way we can get a jumpstart on the production of the mats without having to wait until the campaign ends (plus Amazon's 14 day processing period).\nContinuing Research & Development\nThough our specifications are more or less locked down, we a constantly working to improve the look and functionality of the Windcatcher Air Pad. As we receive feedback minor improvements like the width of the Velcro straps may be made smaller to reduce weight. Of course any changes we make will be done to improve upon the product and all backers will be kept up-to-date and told about any changes.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThough our product is relatively simple to manufacture there is always a chance of running into issues that would delay fulfillment. In the event our OEM partner or supply partners are unable to deliver the necessary components on time, a minor delay may result. \n\nTo limit our risk we have received quotes and samples from multiple partners. If any partner fails to meet expectations, we are ready to switch to a different vendor. In addition to this precaution, we have also padded our delivery date by two weeks; giving us ample time to manufacture a quality air pad before the end of August.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #28", "update_userinfo": "Windcatcher is on Shark Tank!

For the last seven years, I've been photographing using pinhole cameras that I've made myself. Through the years, I've constructed and used extensively about 40 of them; the largest produced images measuring up to 3 x 4 metres while the smallest could fit inside a person's mouth.\nI'm also an industrial designer and a carpenter. In the past few years I've been actively busy with various projects that involved a lot of woodworking. One of my most recognisable projects finished so far is the Floating City, a floating platform intended for sustainable solutions research. With sustainability and quality in mind I've set my mind on smaller and more manageable projects. This is how I came to work on the Ondu Pinhole cameras.\nIn the course of time, I've come to realise there are no simple to use, good-looking, and most of all, affordable cameras out there. Using my knowledge of what happens when the light passes trough the pinhole sized aperture, I've been able to come up with a family of six wooden pinhole cameras. To suit various photographic needs, they come in 6 different dimensions and film sizes, from the most common Leica 135 format to the 4\u02dd x 5\u02dd film holder camera.\nFor those who don't know what a pinhole camera is: It's a camera that uses a pin sized hole to produce an image; there are no lenses involved in this kind of photography. Because of its high aperture, the images produced create effects that no other lens based camera can achieve. The anticipation of what emerges from the exposures is what has kept me hooked on this kind of photography.\nNowadays, most of us own a camera and taking a picture has become such an everyday occurrence that we don't take notice anymore. Well, pinhole photography changes that. Suddenly, you remember what you were doing on the day you took the picture in detail, who approached you to ask about your camera, how you took the shot, and how you felt when you developed the film - all the things missing in today's photography.\nOne of the smallest and lightest cameras around, this camera is still durable enough to outlast any of its digital counterparts. The ONDU 135 Pocket Pinhole camera is great for when you are shy on space and want to take it anywhere with you! It has a pinhole size of 0.20 mm, a focal length of 25 mm, and it comes with a standard tripod mount.\n___________________________________________________________________\nThis camera combines the best of both worlds. It can shoot the regular Leica format in 36 mm x 24 mm or panoramic double frames at 72 mm x 24 mm image. It also hosts a 0,20 mm pinhole size and a focal length of 25 mm and a standard tripod mount. Great for taking amazing panoramic shots with a field of view of 113\u00b0.\n___________________________________________________________________\nA tiny camera, given the fact that it uses 120 format film to expose an image! Like 135, it's small enough to take it anywhere with you but takes images with a greater resolution. The camera has a pinhole size of 0.20 mm, a focal length of 25 mm and a standard tripod mount. Because it uses 120 film, the negatives on this camera are 56 mm x 56 mm, and the angle of view is an astonishing 115\u00b0.\n___________________________________________________________________\nThis is a multi-format all-in-one camera that can take 6 x 6, 6 x 9, and 6 x 12 images. It produces  similar looking results as the ONDU 135 Panoramic but with much greater clarity, thanks to the 120 roll film. The camera has a pinhole size of 0.30 mm, a focal length of 40 mm and a standard tripod mount.\n___________________________________________________________________\nIf you already know a thing or two about pinhole and large format photography, this is the perfect camera for you! It uses a standard 4\u02dd x 5\u02dd film holder that is secured snugly on the back with strong magnets. The camera has a 0.30 mm pinhole, a focal length of 60 mm and a standard tripod mount.\n___________________________________________________________________\nA camera for the collector enthusiasts. It's made with two sliding boxes that hold the paper in place for the exposure. This way, a single image is produced before heading to the darkroom or changing the paper in a changing bag. It uses a paper format of 10,5 x 14,8cm, has a  0.3 mm pinhole and a 50 mm focal length.\n___________________________________________________________________\nShot with the ONDU 135 Panoramic Pinhole camera\nShot with the ONDU 135 Pocket Pinhole camera\nShot with the ONDU 6x6 Pocket Pinhole camera\nAs you can see, my workshop is fairly well equipped for woodworking. Because all the cameras are made entirely by me and my brother Benjamin, at the current rate only a small amount of cameras can be made. That's why we need to invest in tools and equipment that will make our work safer, more efficient and, ultimately, easier.\nWe make all the wooden parts of the cameras ourselves but some parts, like the pins that rewind the film, and the actual pinhole require precise CNC machining. In order for that to be financially feasible I need to order a bulk amount of those parts.\nBecause there's only one screw in the design the winding pins and backplate are held in place with neodymium magnets that have a pulling force of about 0.5 kg a piece. To get them at a reasonable price a bulk order is necessary as well.\nAnd lastly, since I want to make high-end products, the wood which the cameras are made of must be carpentry quality, which means no defects and also a suitable moisture content to minimise the moving of the wood.\n_________________________________________________________________\nMy special thanks go to the team of people who have helped me make this project a reality.\nNiko Klan\u0161ek | Business advisor |\nAndra\u017e Jeri\u010d | The brains and eyes behind the camera |  \nSimon Pen\u0161ek | The ears behind the video | \nDJ Borka | Supplied the awesome music for the video!\nBuy his EP \"What Sticks\" on Bandcamp! |\nNejc Matja\u017e | Technical and engineering support |\nThank you all!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSo far, not much can go wrong since I design and make the cameras myself. There is no third party carpenter or manufacturer that I need to rely on for the cameras to be made, and as this is my full-time job; I'm going to devote all of my time to deliver the cameras that have been on my mind for so long.\n\nAs the cameras are in the second field testing stage, I'm leaving a little room for last changes depending on the feedback. However, it will not affect the visual aspect of the cameras, just make them more fun to use.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #22", "update_userinfo": "ONDU Pinhole Cameras MK II are here THANKS TO YOU!", "update_content": "Finally!

Head to NeoLucida.com for purchasing options. Or follow us on Twitter and on Facebook for updates\n-----------------------------------------\nLong before Google Glass ... there was the Camera Lucida.\nThe what?\nThe camera lucida.\nIt\u2019s a prism on a stick! For making realistic drawings!\nIt used to be everywhere.\nA portable version hasn\u2019t been manufactured in generations.\nAnd we\u2019re bringing it back.\nReally inexpensively.\nFor artists and art students everywhere.\nWe have designed the NeoLucida: the first portable camera lucida to be manufactured in nearly a century \u2014 and the lowest-cost commercial camera lucida ever designed. We want to make this remarkable device widely available to students, artists, architects, and anyone who loves to draw from life. But to be clear: our NeoLucida is not just a product, but a provocation. In manufacturing a camera lucida for the 21st century, our aim is to stimulate interest in media archaeology\u2014the tightly interconnected history of visual culture and imaging technologies.\nOur project: the NeoLucida, a camera lucida for the 21st century. Shown here is a working prototype, constructed from a combination of mass-manufactured and custom-machined parts.\nWhat is this \"NeoLucida\"?\nThe NeoLucida is a drawing aid that allows you to trace what you see. Our device is the first portable, authentic camera lucida to be manufactured in nearly a century\u2014but we like to think of it as a disruption to widespread assumptions about art-making and art history. Our design is lightweight (9oz., or 0.25kg), sturdy, compact enough to fit in a handbag, highly adjustable, totally non-electronic, and released with a liberal open-source hardware license. It's also the least-expensive camera lucida ever manufactured. If you enjoy drawing from life, or if you're interested in experiencing for yourself how the Old Masters could possibly have created such accurate, lifelike drawings\u2014then the NeoLucida is for you. \nLeft: Our NeoLucida, $40. Right: An antique Camera Lucida (c.1900), about $350 on eBay. Owing to modern innovations such as adjustable gooseneck, the NeoLucida has a considerably simpler design.\nSome background history. \nBeginning in the early 17th century, artists routinely used optical aids to help them create realistic drawings. Lenses and mirrors were the \"cutting edge technology\" of their day (and sometimes, the trade secret) for making life-like images. In 1807, Sir William Hyde Wollaston invented the Camera Lucida\u2014and brought life-drawing to a whole new level. Wollaston's device was simple: a prism on an adjustable stand. When an artist looks down through the prism, they see the world in front of them, plus their hand on the page, combined in perfect superimposition. \nIn short, a camera lucida allows you to trace what you see. And it does so in full daylight; there's no need for a dark shroud or box, as with a Camera Obscura. And that is the magic of the camera lucida: it's portable, easy to use, and\u2014with a little practice\u2014you just copy the world onto your page with a confident hand. \nBy the mid-1800s, camera lucidas were everywhere. Indeed, the device is so effective in assisting accurate life-drawing that, according to the controversial Hockney-Falco hypothesis, it's now believed that many of the most admired drawings of the 19th Century, such as the Neoclassical portraits of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, could only have been made with a camera lucida. This becomes astonishingly clear if you try one\u2014an experience we hope to share with as many people as possible, through this Kickstarter.\n(If you'd like to learn more about how the Old Masters likely used optical technologies to create their work, check out David Hockney's book Secret Knowledge, or this terrific BBC documentary (at YouTube) about his research.)\nThe NeoLucida setup: clamp your NeoLucida to a table or drawing board. Place your subject in front, with your paper on the table below the prism. Simply look down into the prism to start drawing.\nPlace your eye close to the prism, looking straight down at the prism's exposed edge, to see a perfect blend of your hand and the scene in front of you.\nOur prototype in action. Here's an unaltered photograph taken through the NeoLucida's eyepiece. The world in front of you is superimposed onto your paper. Just trace what you see!\nNow try this experiment. Go to a group of fine-art students. Find the ones who claim to adore the \"Old Masters\"\u2014and ask them if they\u2019ve ever tried, or even heard of, a camera lucida. We'll bet they haven't (or that they've confused it with the camera obscura). Perhaps it's because a different \"camera\"\u2014the photographic film camera\u2014revolutionized image-making in the intervening century. Once photography became accessible to all, previously common drawing tools like the camera lucida were almost entirely forgotten\u2014and the Old Masters who used them were increasingly believed to have possessed supernatural drawing powers. \nIt hasn't helped that portable camera lucidas have become so rare and costly that most students will never have the chance to try one\u2014not even in an art school. Authentic camera lucidas have become curiosities and fetish objects for antiquarians and professionals, typically costing $300-$500 on eBay. But it's a marvellously simple, useful device\u2014it shouldn't be so exotic!\nSo, why are you doing this? We both have a lot of students who've come to believe that being able to draw photo-realistically is the most important thing. We both love realistic drawing, but not necessarily the way it\u2019s usually taught\u2014which often ignores the tightly-intertwined relationship between drawing and imaging technologies. In particular, art students are encouraged to draw photo-realistically, in the manner of the Old Masters, but without the proper tools for doing so. So we're producing the NeoLucida as a provocation, not as a business, to help get this discussion started. We hope the NeoLucida will prompt new questions about the relationship of art and technology\u2014and potentially even disrupt business-as-usual in the classroom. Most importantly, we genuinely believe that using a camera lucida will profoundly change how people see, how they draw, and how they think about art. \nPortraits by Pablo, created with an antique camera lucida (c.1900, left), and the NeoLucida (right).\nOur Plan.\nWait: aren't there modern, competing products?\nWe wouldn't be doing this if there were any modern-day camera lucidas that met our criteria for easy portability, low cost, and authentic optical design. Unfortunately, there aren't. For example, the LUCID-Art costs $200, weighs four times as much as the NeoLucida, and can't fit in a handbag. Likewise, the LUCI costs more than twice as much as ours; it's bulky, and difficult to adjust. And because the LUCI uses a mirror instead of a prism, you have to draw everything upside-down! (With ours, you draw right-side-up.) Amazingly, these are the only camera lucidas currently being manufactured today\u2014and neither uses the elegant and compact optical design employed throughout the 19th century.\nDesign and Production.\nWe know that for a young artist to even consider experimenting with a camera lucida, it has to be inexpensive. So we\u2019ve designed the NeoLucida to consist almost entirely of prefabricated parts made in China (such as the clamp, prism, and flexible gooseneck mount), and available through business-to-business marketplaces like Alibaba. The only custom pieces (in the optics mount) have been designed by our expert friends at StandardRobot, a Pittsburgh-based mechatronics studio, and will be machined right here in the U.S.A. For both international and domestic parts, we\u2019ve already received multiple bids from different suppliers, and have factored the costs of shipping and customs into our reckoning. \nOur design is complete. We've learned a ton about the Chinese component marketplace. We\u2019ve made and tested several working prototypes, and we're ready to fufill our dream of getting inexpensive camera lucidas into the hands of lots of people. But to do this at all, we have to meet our suppliers\u2019 minimum order requirements\u2014usually, depending on the component, at least 500 pieces. If we can raise 500 orders, then our dream can be your reality! The NeoLucidas themselves will be assembled at Golan\u2019s studio in Pittsburgh, with the assistance of some careful students.\nThis is a Limited Run of Open Source Hardware.\nOur first batch of NeoLucidas will also be our only batch\u2014because, as we\u2019ve explained, we\u2019re doing this as a fun intervention, not to start a business. Once we\u2019ve finished distributing the NeoLucidas, we will publish our designs, CAD files, and all of our supplier data with a liberal Creative Commons and Open-Source Hardware (OSHW) license, so that anyone who wishes can continue the project (including, potentially, commercially). Our design and other manufacturing information will appear on NeoLucida.com, Instructables, Scribd, and other appropriate sites. We hope others will be inspired to pick up where we leave off!\nYour own NeoLucida. \nIf you support our project at the $40 level or higher, you'll get one NeoLucida in a draw-string pouch, plus instructions on using and caring for your device. The cost of shipping (within the US) is included.\nSo how is your NeoLucida \u201cprism-on-a-stick\u201d manufactured? We use a silvered prism, optimized for optical clarity, carefully encased in a custom anodized aluminum mount. The prism is supported by a highly adjustable gooseneck arm and a sturdy metal clamp. We even use a 1/4\u201d-20 threaded bolt as the connection between the gooseneck arm and the prism holder\u2014so your NeoLucida arm can easily double as a standard camera mount. All this is hand-assembled in Pittsburgh before being carefully packaged and sent off to you. Open it up and start drawing right away!\nBut there's more. Beyond just making a device for your use, we really want to see what you draw with your NeoLucida. In some ways, this is the true heart of our project. That\u2019s why every recipient of a NeoLucida will also receive a postage-prepaid blank postcard. And a NeoLucida pencil, too. Make a drawing with your NeoLucida, pop the card in the mail, and your drawing may end up in a published collection of NeoLucida drawings!\nCan I get more than one? Unfortunately not, per Kickstarter's \"Single Serving rule\" for rewards in the Product Design category. If, however, you're interested in classroom packs or other wholesale arrangements, please contact us privately. \nBacked by Primary Research.  \nSo, how are we qualified to do this, and why are we confident? We're both art professors and have spent the bulk of our careers using both modern and historical imaging technologies. Sure, most artists have used digital cameras\u2014but we've logged tons of hours with concave mirrors, large biconvex lenses, camera obscuras and camera lucidas.\nSelections from Pablo Garcia's personal collection of vintage camera lucidas.\nPablo using one of his antique camera lucidas, Iceland, 2010.\nExamples of Pablo's camera lucida drawings, 2010.\nPablo has spent a dozen years drawing with his camera lucida. Since acquiring his first one in 2001, he has also amassed one of the world's largest collections of primary and secondary research into the technology and history of this device. Pablo's collection includes many of the most important books, patents, articles, schematics, and contemporary accounts of the camera lucida. \nPossibly the best evidence that we're qualified to conduct this project is Pablo\u2019s personal collection of antique camera lucidas. Over the course of a decade, he has acquired the best examples of original camera lucidas throughout history. In his collection are devices from 1820, 1840, 1860, 1880, 1900, 1930, and several versions sold as children's drawing aids from the 1940s through the 1960s. This collection is one of the most complete primary resources on the technology around\u2014and served as the research foundation for our design of the NeoLucida.\nWho are we?\nPablo Garcia and Golan Levin are university art professors and new-media artists, with a strong shared interest in the history and poetics of imaging technologies.\nPablo Garcia (@prgarc) is Assistant Professor of Contemporary Practices at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Trained as an architect, Pablo's recent work has evolved from design-for-hire to internationally exhibited artworks, provocations and research studies. His work has appeared on FastCompany/Co.Design, io9, ArtInfo, ThisIsColossal, Gizmodo, Make, The Creators Project and many others. Previously, Pablo has taught at Carnegie Mellon, Parsons, University of Michigan, and Princeton. From 2004-2007, he also worked as an architect and designer for Diller Scofidio + Renfro.\nGolan Levin (@golan) is Associate Professor of Computation Arts at Carnegie Mellon University; a member of the Free Art and Technology artist collective; and an enthusiastic Kickstarter supporter. At CMU, he also directs the Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry, a laboratory for anti-disciplinary research across the arts, sciences, technology, and culture. A two-time TED speaker, Golan has been called one of \"50 Designers Shaping the Future\" by Fast Company Magazine, an \"A-OK guy\" by Bruce Sterling, and a lot of other things. \nWe're also greatly indebted to our tireless research assistant Sarah Keeling, who has spent long nights communicating with Chinese vendors; to our expert mechanical engineer, Greg Baltus, of StandardRobot; to Benji Welmond, a talented filmmaker who has assisted with our videography, and to the staff of the Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry, who have supported our research in numerous other ways. \nOpen Source.\nThe NeoLucida will be wholly Open Source Hardware (OSHW), and will be released with documentation (including all CAD files) according to the definitions, standards and recommendations of the Open Source Hardware Association.\nQuestions?\nAsk away! We encourage you to post your questions on Kickstarter, so that others may benefit from your question and our response. However, you may also email us privately at info@neolucida.com, or message us on Twitter at @golan and @prgarc.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProducing a couple thousand identical products is a challenge for anyone, especially those without a factory at their disposal. We are not only leveraging the Chinese factory system, with its standard parts ready for shipping, but also small, American design and fabrication companies with proven track records. This gives us the best of both worlds, allowing us to combine inexpensive components with custom components where appropriate.\n\nShould manufacturing issues arise, we have several options for local fabrication companies in Pittsburgh and Chicago. Finding alternate sources for the custom parts is not as difficult as it was ten years ago. These digitally-driven fabrication methods are now common industry standards. \n\nIn addition, we have both spent decades providing technical solutions to creative problems. Pablo was trained as an architect and designer and has spent over a decade working with digital fabrication equipment. Golan is a new media artist who has created and deployed robust, technically sophisticated installations all over the world. We are counting on that experience to provide both solid logistical planning and readiness to solve problems as they occur.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #34", "update_userinfo": "NeoLucida XL: One week in, and new Rewards to help students draw!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "NeoLucida XL is here!", "update_content": "The Mid-2014 NeoLucida Pre-Order: through May 31\nIt's back!
