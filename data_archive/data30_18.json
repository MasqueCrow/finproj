Tyler has appeared at most major US festivals and performed thousands of concerts and guitar workshops worldwide. He was an original member of the Emmitt-Nershi Band and a sideman for Abigail Washburn, April Verch and Adrienne Young. He has produced four solo albums and four releases by Grant Farm for his own Grant Central Records. The latest 2016 release, Earth and Wood, a triumphant return to Bluegrass, is Tyler's first Acoustic album since the acclaimed Up The Neck six years before. In 2016 Grant Farm released their most ambitious endeavor, Kiss The Ground, a concept album for the working people, which debuted at #5 on the Relix/JamBand Radio Charts. The 2014 release, Meeting on the Mountain, an inspired collaboration with the band Fruition, spawned the concept of the Meeting on the Mountain\u00ae LIVE Broadcast, a radio-style musical program, of which Tyler is host.
