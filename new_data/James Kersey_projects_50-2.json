In her mind, only a Great House has the right to such power, but who will listen to a poor Irish woman? House Lowell will. For Alice Lowell has inherited an old Puritan journal which describes how to find and enslave a demon, but she needs a psychic to do it. Kidnapping Caitlin is the first step in a plan to rid her husband\u2019s House of debt. But with a demon to do their bidding, her ambitions will be limitless.\nThe Book of Demons can be read as a standalone, but it is a continuation of Ghosts and Demons.\nFirst Three Pages:\nNEW TO BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY?\nIf you are new to the series, the original six issue mini-series is about an ex-Pinkerton detective, a spirit photographer, and a genius scientist who battle supernatural forces in late 1800\u2019s Boston. They  live in an alternate steampunk history where ghosts and demons are a normal part of life. Families known as the Great Houses control the economy of the Great States of America while the middle class and lower classes sole purpose are to serve the Great Houses.\nThe original trade paperback is available in several reward tiers.\nWHAT'S IN THE TRADE?\nI'm glad you asked. Not only does it include all six issues from the  original mini-series as well as the cover art, but it also contains a  ten page  short story called, Hunter-Killer,  and additional bonus pages. With art by Emily Hu and coloring by Gloria Caeli, the story is set at the beginning of the House Wars (my version of the American Civil War) and features the crew of a prototype airship.  I introduce three new characters: Gwen Warrick - Captain;  Emmet Rochester - Navigator; and Joaquin Medina - Engineer.\nThe complete sequential art version of Hunter-Killer will ONLY be available in the trade.\nWHAT ELSE IS THERE?\nOur three previous standalone sequels will be available as well. And they are:\nTHE SCOURGE OF THE MECHANICAL MEN \nSTORY: Granville and Tesla are in a race for time to save Boston from a mysterious disease that turns human beings into machines.\n\nTHE SPIRIT OF REBELLION \n STORY: Caitlin flees to Philadelphia only to discover a ghost, a rebellion, and perhaps, her destiny.\n\nGHOSTS AND DEMONS \n STORY:  A disturbing dream leads Caitlin and the team to face off with a new enemy.\nTHE BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY COLORING BOOK:\nTwenty (20) gorgeous illustrations for you to relax  and color away to your heart's content. Includes illustrations of  Samuel, Granville, Caitlin, Tesla, Houdini, and more! It will be an 8  1/2 x 11 book and is suitable for all ages.

It takes place five years prior to the original series.\nIt was awarded a Silver Medal as well as The Write Companion Award for Best Overall TOP PICK - Adult, Children's and Young Adult categories in the 2019 Feathered Quill Book Awards.\nStory: As the Great Houses of Boston jockey for power, an ex-Pinkerton detective, his psychic wife, and his father-in-law must contend with treachery, subterfuge, and a new supernatural threat, in this political and supernatural thriller set in an alternate-history Boston of 1890.\nThe award winning cover is by Luisa Preissler. Title Graphics by Anke Koopman.\n\nAnd if you haven't read Boston Metaphysical Society: Prelude yet, then this would be the perfect time to get it. This anthology of short stories and novellas includes stories of how Granville and Samuel met and their first case together; what set Caitlin on her path; and how Samuel met his wife, Elizabeth Weldsmore Hunter. Several reward tiers  include it as either a pdf or print version.\nThe Underground - A Boston Metaphysical Society Short Story (Available as an Add-on for all tiers and is already included in the Granville Woods and All Things BMS tiers.) \nIn The Underground,  Andrew O'Sullivan takes his young daughter, Caitlin, on a case that might reveal a past and a potential future neither of them expected.

Those who order the Nothing But Books and All Things BMS will get the usual sturdy cardboard box as those have worked well in the past.\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING: We were able to obtain discounted international postage for over 55 countries this year. I have passed on those savings to you depending on your shipping address. To extend these savings even further, for those who pledge to the Nothing But Books or the All Things BMS, and it is shipped to one of those 55 countries, we will be splitting up the rewards into two boxes in order for you to receive the discount. \nTHE TEAM FOR THE SEQUELS:\nMadeleine Holly-Rosing - Writer/Creator: A   TV, feature film, comic book writer, and novelist, Madeleine holds an   MFA in Screenwriting from UCLA where she won numerous awards as well as  the Sloan Fellowship.

Inspired by fantasy and the art of storytelling,   Holly-Rosing uses her imagination to create a fantastic story that is   both well-written and fearless.\" - Valerie Complex (Fansided)\n\"If you have a taste for an intelligent, well written, elegantly   illustrated award winning independent book, you can't go wrong with   Boston Metaphysical Society!\" - Alex Yarde (The Good Man Project)\n\"This very inventive series posits a totally believable Steampunk   world that is populated by appealing characters who act (and react) in   believable manners to the extraordinary events that swirl around them.\"  -  Robert Sodaro (Comic Reviewer at Examiner.com)\nTHE STORY BEHIND THE STORY\nI love writing BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY.  Not only does it bring my  love of science fiction and history  together, (which by the way, equals  steampunk), the steampunk time  period allows me to address the themes  of classism, sexism, and racism  in America in a thoughtful and engaging  way. For at its very core,  BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY is an American  story. And you can't tell an  American story without including women and  people of color.\nIt has been and always will be important to me to write characters  who, though they come from diverse backgrounds and have different  points  of view, are able to work together for the common good.\nADD-ONS\nI have decided not to use the option of Kickstarter add-ons during this campaign, though I will be using Backerkit when I send out the surveys if you'd like to add anything to your pledge.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nSTRETCH GOAL #1 - $5,700 - (KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE) **REACHED!**\nBackers who have pledged $10 or more to a physical reward will  receive  this wonderful 8 1/2 x 11 inch print on 10 pt. cardstock gloss  by the  amazing Ashley Woods. \nAshley has worked for Marvel, Dark Horse, IDW, and Stranger Comics (Niobe).

In other words, it would be a whole lot like... \nWHAT IS THE SOLAVORE?\nThe Eater of Dawns\nLike a vampire needs blood, so the ancient evil known as THE SOLAVORE needs the energy of a sun. Absent for centuries from the far-off galaxy of the Morrigen people, the Solavore had disappeared into the realm of myth. But now, with one of their solar systems facing a cosmic loss, the Morrigen are learning that the Solavore is not only real... but hungry.\n\n WHO IS HUNTING IT? \nFor years, the Galactic Kingdom of the Morrigen had been protected by its latest ruler, the brave and brilliant KING THEOSIS. Committed to the freedom and safety of his people, King Theosis has lead the Morrigen through decades of darkness, striving toward a future of progress and peace. But after so many battles, Theosis's beard has gone white; the grip on his sword has grown weaker.  And after a devastating personal loss, Theosis must summon a strength he's never known to defeat the worst threat the Morrigen have ever seen.\nFortunately for Theosis, his husband ABBINOIR will be there to help. Wise and compassionate as any ruler his people have served, Abbinoir is Theosis's personal strength. While the king is looking out for the kingdom, Abbinoir looks out for its king. And though he's been doing it for all of Theosis's reign, every new threat weighs more on his mind, none more so than the Solavore. After all, how can you protect a man who must protect a kingdom?\nNot that he won't have help. In facing this unheard-of crisis, Theosis will have at his command some of the best warriors in the entire galaxy: his own royal guard and the elite female warriors known as the VALKINAE. Together, they make up the best defense the Morrigen have.\nBut will they be enough?\n\nSNEAK PREVIEW\nCheck out some of the (not finalized) pages of HUNT FOR THE SOLAVORE.\n(Pages not final)\n(Pages not final)\n(Pages not final)\n WHO IS CREATING HUNT FOR THE SOLAVORE? \nLANE LLOYD - Creator of the weird and zany, Lane is an up and coming artist with an energetic, off the wall style. After being featured on Comic Book Yeti, Outright Geekery, and The Driving Creators Network, Lane's comic GOD-PUNCHER smashed its way onto Kickstarter, receiving more than double the projected amount of funding.  With HUNT FOR THE SOLAVORE, Lane uses their skill of designing strange, larger-than-life characters to tell a story that's both firmly planted in the horror genre and stretched to the outer limits of science fiction.\nGRANT DeARMITT - Grant's tales of the sinister and strange have been published at Haw Creek Horror, Crystal Lake Publishing, and Black Hole Entertainment.  A lifelong fan of weird fiction and fantasy epics, Grant hopes HUNT FOR THE SOLAVORE will present the human side of cosmic terror; an otherworldly story that hits home.\n\nWHY ARE THEY CREATING IT?\nKing Theosis's ship. For interplanetary travel... and beyond.\nLane and Grant have spent two years developing the shocking showdown of Theosis and the Solavore. They made this Kickstarter to bring that story to life in the form it deserves: the comic book format.  But there is another reason. \nHUNT FOR THE SOLAVORE is just one story of thousands set in this all-new universe that Lane and Grant have cooked up. Getting it created, printed, and into the hands of readers like yourself is the first step in telling those tales. We believe that comic fans are hungry for new worlds and new terrors, and we believe we have some great ones to offer.\nSo by backing this project, you're not just helping us make a comic. You're opening a door to another galaxy, and all the heroes and horrors that live there.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIt takes time and a whole lot of effort to put together a story as ambitious as HUNT FOR THE SOLAVORE, which is why we're making sure our creative team gets funding to do so! $4200 will go to Lane for his brilliant work drawing, inking, coloring, AND lettering each gorgeous and terrifying page of HFTS, while $2100 will go to Grant for his plotting, several edits, and writing of the script.

Since their creation, these mafia bunnies have been featured in two full-length comic collections (Meet the Family and The Blind Tiger), several booklets (Based on a True Story Vol. 1-2), and have run amuck in countless comic anthology projects (Unlawful Good, Out of the Deep, Forgotten Histories...just to name a few). \nAnd yet, after all of these successful products, there's one project that really shows the true nature of the Dust Bunny Mafia outside of the comic book landscape, which has eluded me thus far: playing cards. With this Kickstarter, I plan to make that dream into a reality. \nIntroducing Dust Bunny Mafia Playing Cards\nThis deck will be a 55 card, standard poker-sized deck of playing cards featuring 52 of my favorite Dust Bunny Mafia characters from the comics to complete the standard deck. \n\nThis will be a limited edition print run for the deck. No more than 500 decks will be produced.\nHere you'll find all 52 cards that complete the standard deck.\nDeck Specifications\nFor the funding goal of $3,000, below are the playing card specifications. As stretch goals are unlocked, there will be chances to upgrade elements of the cards. The more funding that's raised, the better deck quality I will be able to produce.\n Card Stock: (S30) Standard Smooth\n Size of deck: 55 cards\n Print type: Full color print\n Finish: MPC game card finish\n Packaging: Custom Tuck Box (Unsealed) - Glossy\n Box seals: Custom seal\n\nJoker Cards\nAlong with the standard deck there are 3 Joker cards. Two of the Jokers are by guest artists, which will be revealed during the campaign. \n\nThe first guest artist Joker card is Floyd the Crow as drawn by Sean Luke, creator of the Zombie Raygun comic. You can find Sean Luke on Instagram, check out Zombie Raygun on Facebook, or pick up your own copy of Zombie Raygun on Indyplanet\nThe second guest artist joker card is by The Awkward Yeti (Nick Seluk)!\nNick Seluk is the creator of The Awkward Yeti, Heart and Brain, Medical Tales Retold, and Olo.\nYou can find Nick on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and Patreon.\nThe third, and final Joker card, is a Mobimal (Mobster animal) commission card.\n\n***DOMESTIC U.S. SHIPPING INCLUDED***\nWhat do people say about the Dust Bunny Mafia?\n ***READ BASED ON A TRUE STORY VOL. 1, A DUST BUNNY MAFIA MINI COMIC COLLECTION, FOR FREE BY CLICKING HERE.

In 2019, he successfully funded a Kickstarter for Based on a True Story,  a Dust Bunny Mafia mini comic collection. In 2020, Bret returned to Kickstarter to fund his second Dust Bunny Mafia collection, The Blind Tiger and the second volume of the Based on a True Story mini comic collection.

It's 50 years later, I've had Oscar nominations and won Cannes Festival awards, and it's time to fulfill a boyhood dream.\nThree years ago, I wrote out a storyboard about a slide guitar-playing cowboy named Slide who appears in a corrupt logging town (circa 1940's) to battle a pair of evil twins and save the village of Sourdough Creek.\nSLIDE has villains, an old-time country music cowboy band, the Lucky Buck Saloon and Bordello, and a glorious Oregon backdrop (And it features a hero who, like me, plays the slide guitar.)\nBy raising our $77,800 minimum goal here on Kickstarter my team and I will be able to devote most of the next six months to SLIDE, with a completion date in 2022.\nBut I want to get SLIDE to you sooner.\nWe have a very ambitious $200,000 \"stretch\" goal that would allow us to complete SLIDE by this time next year - and wouldn't it be great to have a new animated film ready for our safe return to theaters!\nI think you're going to love the rewards: Attend the New York City premiere of SLIDE; Take a private animation class with me, either via Zoom or (after the pandemic) in my NYC studio; And ALL backers at the $100 level or higher will see their name in the closing credits!\nI'm also drawing the caricature of at least one backer who will get to play a Old West villain, have a speaking role, see their name in the closing credits, AND get an IMDb credit.\nBest of all, on Dec. 18, 2020 we're sending out a survey to all of our backers, giving you the option of gifting one of our rewards in time for the holidays. We'll email a gift certificate for the reward you select to the recipient you designate.\nOne of the cool advantages of going to Kickstarter now, halfway through the production, is that we have a lot of clips and sequences to share.  Follow me on Facebook daily during the campaign as I do a drawing a day on camera so you can see how I create my characters and animation.\nPeople call me the \"King of Indie Animation\" and I hope to capitalize on that moniker to give people an inside look at how I create my films - from the concept to the editing and music.  \nThanks for supporting independent animation, and a sincere thanks for supporting me and my new film SLIDE with your generous pledge.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs an independent filmmaker, being self-financed is a risk all by itself. I animate a few commercial projects each year, recently a few cool music videos and an nearly-annual \"couch gag\" for the opening of \"The Simpsons\" on FOX-TV. And the income from those projects is very helpful in keeping my studio running - but it only gets me about halfway there if I want to keep creating my own animated shorts and features. Some advance theatrical distribution money from France also helps, but I've used Kickstarter to help fill the gap. My fans have helped with the production of two features, \"Cheatin'\" and \"Revengeance\", and a series of political shorts called \"Trump Bites\". My hardcore fans have bought their DVD or streaming copies in advance, which gets me the money early to finish animating the film faster, I don't have to wait for another big commercial project to come in and fund the feature.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Insider Sneak Peeks", "descp": "Follow Bill through the making of SLIDE with exclusive updates, stills and animated clips available only to Kickstarter backers.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2021"}], "stat": ["51 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Stream SLIDE at Home", "descp": "We'll send you a private link to stream SLIDE once it completes its theatrical premiere and/or Oscar qualification PLUS sneak peeks into the making of SLIDE.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2022"}], "stat": ["112 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Autographed DVD of SLIDE", "descp": "You\u2019ll receive a limited edition DVD of \"Slide\", hand-signed by Bill Plympton, and mailed to your home after the film\u2019s theatrical run and Oscar-qualification process.

You can usually find me on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook sharing work in progress and talking about movies, video games, and comic books.\n My Father Wrestles Alligators and Other Fantastic Lies From My Five Older Brothers is a children's book about all the crazy stories my older brothers told me as a little kid.\nBook Cover Design\nAs the youngest of 6 boys I was often the recipient of many crazy stories. Stories about how my dad would wrestle alligators on the weekends. Or stories about how my grandmother was a quarter werewolf who didn\u2019t like when you touched all the little trinkets in her living room. \nWas my grandmother part werewolf? Maybe...\nThese stories fueled my wild imagination and always had me wondering what was real and what was just another weird joke! While recently telling my son an \u201cexaggerated story\u201d about his grandmother, it dawned on me that I should collect all the nonsense my older brothers fed to me as a kid.\nAnd the idea for My Father Wrestles Alligators was born!\nWhen creating this book I really wanted to capture how I pictured things as a 6 year old. I believe the absurdity of it all shines through in my illustrations and hope you enjoy it!\nWeirdos out of my head, onto the printed page...\nThe book is 100% set for print. I have written many drafts and worked with a few of my writer friends to button it up. I am pretty confident it is ready to share with the world.

The book will have a perfect-bound spine encased with a softcover. I plan on methodically reviewing the proofs and using a local printer will allow me to keep close tabs on the entire process. \nAlong with the printed book you can receive some pretty cool rewards for helping get this project funded.

Now a \"criminal\" herself, she's been sent to Planet Y, the prison planet, where every evil man, woman, and mutant she ever put away is waiting for her on this... PLANET SLAMMER! \nPlanet Slammer is an action packed sci-fi fantasy adventure! It is candy for your eyes and brain! Bright colors! Strange and grotesque creatures! Strong female protagonists! Weird underground and underwater worlds! People getting punched in the face and possibly decapitated! Dorky made-up names for made-up creatures and locations! If these things make you say, \"I want this comic book!\" Then let me tell you, friend... you definitely do want this comic book. \nPLANET SLAMMER #4\nPlanet Slammer #4 represents the end of the initial story arc for Planet Slammer. This campaign is raising funds to get #4 printed, but I wanted to make the whole story available to new-comers, so you will see that the rewards include options for you to get any issues you might be missing, or the whole series if needed! Issues are 22-24 pages long.\nTo make it super worth your while, there's also going to be a super-rad \"making of\" Planet Slammer Process PDF book included at every reward level. This book will include a look at the working script (like, literal scanned script with layout notes in the margins, etc.), thumbnail pages, and the final pencil roughs for just about every page of Planet Slammer #4. You will be able to compare the process against the final product, every step of the way. So far I'm at about 36 pages, but will probably add a few more to get into some finer details about the process. Really cool info for cartoonists, and people who are interested in that sort of thing in general. \nFinally, I'm also making available some original art for the higher reward levels. All of the original art levels will also include a printed copy of Planet Slammer #4 and all of the various digital rewards that come at the lower levels! \nSneak preview pages of issue #4:\nThe kind of stuff that's gonna be included in the Process PDF book:\nOriginal Art Options: ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll projects come with some risks, however the risks with Planet Slammer #4 are relatively low. The book is 100% complete and ready to print, the campaign is just for printing funds - so as soon as the campaign funds, the books will be ordered, and I will ship them out as soon as I get them.\n\nThere is some risk that there could be unforeseen problems with the printer or delivery that would be out of my control. I will do my best to mitigate these issues, and of course keep you all updated on any potential delays. \n\nThere is also some risk that the books could be damaged in delivery to you. I will do my best to prevent any damage, however if such damage does occur, I will happily ship you a replacement. \n\nFinally, due to COVID-19, I will not be able to ship outside of the U.S. for this campaign.

However, unbeknownst to him, his guide and bodyguard, Lamond Yohe, is also on a journey to avenge his brother by hunting down and killing all the former cultists who took his life.  \nTwo Swords Til Mercy is a five-issue miniseries written by Brentt Harshman with line art by J. Paul Schiek, colors by A.H.G., and lettering by LetterSquids. Imagine if Sergio Leone directed an episode of Game of Thrones, and you'll come close to what we picture with this book. \nWe are asking for $5,000 which will be split between production costs, kickstarter fees, printing, and shipping. \nWHO WILL ENJOY TWO SWORDS TIL MERCY?\n- Fans of Tarantino, Sergio Leone, and Game of Thrones.\n- Readers of Crone, East of West, and Once & Future.\n- People who enjoy high octane action and engaging dialogue. Strong characters...oh, and bloody revenge. \nThe point of this kickstarter is to raise funds to produce the first issue (of five) of a new comic book series. That's the main reward...but that doesn't mean there aren't other goodies outside of digital and physical copies of the books.\nWe will also be featuring original sketch cards, prints, pieces of art, other works by the creative team, short stories and watercolor sketches by EASTIN DEVERNA of SAMURAI GRANDPA fame, a custom printed map of Mercy, an alternate cover by J., variant covers by friends who also happen to be AMAZING artists, as well as stickers, shirts, buttons/pins, and coffee mugs as stretch goals if we surpass our goal of 5,000 dollars. \nOur first variant cover is an alternate cover by creators of the book J.

This is a great introduction into the Dust Bunny Mafia universe.***\n***DOMESTIC US SHIPPING INCLUDED, and all books come signed by creator Bret Juliano.***\n  Introducing, The Blind Tiger, a Dust Bunny Mafia comic collection.\nWhat's contained in this 132 page collection?\nThe Blind Tiger contains over 200 comics, a pin-up gallery, Bret Juliano's guest strips for other webcomics, and a brand new book-exclusive comic chapter focusing on the Corvalus mafia family, entitled \"As the Crow Flies.\"\nCampaign Exclusives\nMobimal (mobster animal) drawn into the book\nCrocheted Mobimal Characters\nLimited edition poker chip\n   Who will love Dust Bunny Mafia? \nFans of mafia-related pop culture like The Godfather, Goodfellas, and The Sopranos.\nLovers of Saturday morning cartoons and the Sunday funny papers.\nPeople who like cartoons such as Looney Tunes and Animaniacs.\nCollectors of high quality independent comic books.\nHere's What People are Saying...\n Based on a True Story\n  You can read Based on a True Story, a Dust Bunny Mafia mini comic collection, for free by clicking here.\nBret Juliano - Creator\n  Bret Juliano is a cartoonist and creator of the all ages Dust Bunny Mafia comic, which has over 650 comics in its archive and Mobimals. In late 2016, Bret published Meet the Family, a Dust Bunny Mafia comic collection. In 2019, he successfully funded a Kickstarter for Based on a True Story, a Dust Bunny Mafia mini comic collection. His dust bunny mobsters have also been included in several anthologies including Unlawful Good, Forgotten Histories and Out of the Deep as part of the Let\u2019s Make Comics: Chicago Collective. He is an avid consumer of mafia trivia, both fact and fiction, and a passionate collector of fedoras.\nFor as far back as I can remember I was always drawing. When I was a kid, my dream job was to be an animator for Disney, but as I grew up, my focus shifted into the world of comics...newspaper styled comics especially.\nGarfield, Calvin and Hobbes, Peanuts, Zits, Get Fuzzy...I could keep going, but I won't. I would read the Sunday funny paper back to back for years.\nThese were the things that brought joy to me and my comics, the Dust Bunny Mafia in particular, is my opportunity to tell my stories and give back in comics form.\nI am coming to Kickstarter in order to create The Blind Tiger, a Dust Bunny Mafia comic collection because there's a supportive audience here that can help me grow my brand's reach and I know people need a to laugh and I know that my Dust Bunny Mafia comics can help with that.\nWhy did I write this book?\n  I love mobster stories, they are the modern day version of the cowboys of the wild West.\n This book proposes a world where mobsters may not be evil. What if they are not the corrupt ones after all? What would it look like if the mobsters didn't know they were the villains at all?\nWhat will the funds be used for?\nWith this Kickstarter, I'm looking to do a 200 copy first run of this collection. Last go-around, I was shooting for a 250 copy print run and was looking to cover all expenses of the project.\nThis time, I am only looking to cover the cost of the smaller print run, packing materials, getting the books delivered to me, and of course the Kickstarter & Stripe fees.\nWith a smaller campaign goal and less books, it should still allow for enough copies to fulfill the Kickstarter pre-orders and have some stock to sell at conventions in the future. \nMain Chapter: The Sugar Ban\nWhen a nationwide sugar ban goes into effect leaving citizens craving  sugar, Leo Veronisci only sees opportunity. Allying himself with the  Corvalus brothers to leverage both families to push his bootleg sugar to  the masses makes both families rich. Until a bumbling detective  accidentally stumbles into a sugar delivery.\nA Look Inside The Blind Tiger\nSo...What's in it For Me? (The Pledge Levels)\n  Get Your Own Mobimal Drawn Into the Book!\nAt the Boss ($175) and Boss of Bosses ($300) pledge levels, I will draw your very own mobimal into the book in an advertisement for the Four Deuces casino, run by the Dust Bunny Mafia. Limited to 5 characters only.\nProject Timeline\nMilestone Bonus Gifts\n  After we reach funding at each of the major milestones above, a new Blind Tiger related Dust Bunny Mafia mini-print will be revealed. Each print was done by a different comic artist, but I need your help to unlock them! Digital mini-prints will be sent to everyone at the Soldier level ($15) or above. Physical mini-prints will be sent with every Made Member level ($30) or above.\nWhat's left to do?\nThe Blind Tiger is 99% complete.\nThere is only one page that hasn't been finished, the Four Deuces advertisement page. Once the Kickstarter ends, I will be in contact with the backers at the Boss and Boss of Bosses levels to get started on their mobimal characters, and hopefully be able to draw them in during the two weeks while I wait for the funds to clear.\nOnce that's been done, I can send the files to the printer and then ship the books out once they're printed.\nLast year I brought my first project to Kickstarter, a mini comic collection, Based on a True Story and I can't thank everyone enough for supporting my work before on Kickstarter. You are directly responsible for helping me achieve this dream of producing my own comics. Please join me and back this Kickstarter to help my dream of making comics come true.\nFREE PREVIEW\n***READ BASED ON A TRUE STORY, A DUST BUNNY MAFIA MINI COMIC COLLECTION, FOR FREE BY CLICKING HERE.

In between launching the campaign again, I have re-worked several of the pledge levels and decreased the funding goal to reflect a lower quantity of books being ordered and taking on more of the cost for shipping the books out to you on myself.\n\nAs stated above, the collection is nearly complete.

Dust Bunny Mafia is Looney Tunes meets The Godfather. Seven years ago I first started publishing the Dust Bunny Mafia comic. Nearly 650 comics later, I am now coming to Kickstarter to help bring this mini collection to life.\nWhat are people saying about the Dust Bunny Mafia?\nBased on a True Story\nBased on a True Story is a 24 page mini comic collection (8.5\" X 5.5\") containing 22 comics, printed in glorious full color, each based on a real life mobster stories. \nFor years I have been fascinated with mobsters, but more memorable to me than Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corelone from The Godfather and Joe Pesci in Goodfellas, or any other Hollywood interpretation of the mafia lifestyle are the real life stories of the made members of the American mafia.\nIf you ask just about anyone to name a real life mobster, more often than not, the number one answer is going to be Al 'Scarface' Capone. Everyone can tell you something about Al Capone, but fewer can tell you much about his criminal mentor, Johnny \"The Fox\" Torrio, who after retiring from the head of the Chicago mob lived out the rest of his days peacefully, for another 32 years. \nJohnny \"The Fox\" Torrio doesn't get nearly enough credit as his protege, Al Capone.\nWhen people think of Las Vegas, one of the first thoughts is usually the gambling, and people have a man named Benjamin \"Bugsy\" Siegel, to thank for that. With his Hollywood flair and charisma, he was crucial in developing the Las Vegas Strip as we know it today. \nBenjamin \"Bugsy\" Siegel was one of Las Vegas' most legendary visionaries.\nThese are the kinds of stories that fascinate me, and this collection is what I am asking for your help in bringing to print. \nWhat's left to do?\nBased on a True Story is 100% complete.\nEverything about this collection is done, all that's left is send the files to the printer and then ship the books out once they're printed. \nWith this Kickstarter, I'm looking to do a 100 copy limited run of this collection. This should allow for enough copies to fulfill the Kickstarter pre-orders and allow me with copies to sell at conventions in the future. If the project is wildly successful and over-funded, I will look into printing more copies as the funding allows.\nWhat Rewards Are Available?\n\n\n\n\nMobimals are a spin-off of the Dust Bunny Mafia brand where I took real life mobsters with animal nicknames and re-imagined them as their animal counterparts. The Mobimals: Chicago, first edition is a 12 page collection (5.5\" X 8.5\") featuring ten of Chicago's most fearsome animal nicknamed gangsters.\nSeveral characters from the Mobimals: Chicago edition show up in the Based on a True Story comic collection which unites the Dust Bunny Mafia and Mobimals brands together to tell a unified story.\nWhat about shipping?\nFree shipping for the United States has already been pre-built into the pledge levels. For other countries, additional shipping costs will occur upon check-out.\nAs for the shipping materials, I will be using rigid photo mailers to ship out the booklets in. By using these materials I hope to minimize the amount of damaged products, but if anything does happen to your shipment, you can contact me and I'll fix it.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile this is my first attempt at Kickstarter, the collection is 100% complete and only needs to be printed and shipped.

It's set in a dark and gritty fantasy universe: full of tragic heroes, violent deaths and eldritch, Lovecraftian horror. \nWith a dark, immersive plot and inspired by legendary titles such as Ultima and the gold box series, this is my love letter to classic roleplaying.  \nThe project was an instant hit, reaching 100% funding within 24 hours! Now is the time to help make SKALD: Against the Black Priory reach its fullest potential as an epic tale of dark fantasy chock full of amazing 8-bit art and music! \n\nUPDATE: The game will now release for Windows AND Mac and backers may choose either version. The DEMO and BETA will only release on PC for now!\n\n\n SKALD: Against the Black Priory is a tile and turn based roleplaying game where you lead a party of up to six characters on an epic and perilous quest.\n SKALD ships with an optional, retro-style, CRT screen filter!\n\n\nThe game features: \nVintage graphics using the glorious Commodore 64 color palette\nComplex level-based character development with abilities, skills and features\nGrindless tactical combat\n\"Choose-your-own-adventure\" system and  dynamic, tree based dialog.\nAs a party based RPG, SKALD puts heavy emphasis on both roleplaying- and mechanical interaction between party members.\n\nThe current leader of the party can be swapped by the push of a button and the skills and abilities of the current leader will influence interactions with the game world. But be warned: Managing the party can be challenging with members having private agendas and motivations.\nCombat in SKALD is turn- and menu-based. This leads to fast and grind-less combat (that can be automated). The design emphasis is on having interactions between abilities, tactics and situational circumstances create unique and challenging combat every time.\nThe game will feature a rich and highly interactive world with both scripted and systemic ways of interacting with the hundreds of NPCs, items, objects and plot points. The game will allow for, and encourage, a large range of player expression and roleplaying. \nInteracting with the world takes place through tree-based dialog, \"choose-you-own-adventure sequences\", combat, tile-based exploration and interaction with in-game systems. \n SKALD: Against the Black Priory will feature level-based character development with both numerical stats and special abilities. I also intend for roleplaying choices to affect character development by taking a leaf from classics such as Fallout 1 and 2. \nSKALD is a fantasy setting and magic is a huge part of fantasy world building. It will play a big part in the game and designing a system that is both mechanically and narratively appealing is a challenge I can't wait to dig into! More on that down the line. \n\nThe game will release on Windows and Mac first with releases for handheld devices down the line. NOTE: The demo and BETA version is for Windows only!\nEstimated release date is June 2020. \n\nThe Gallian Empire is in turmoil: By virtue of it's Wizard Lords, the Empire stood for a thousand years. Now the fabrics of the realm is fraying. Within, the ruling elite is losing its jealously guarded monopoly on the use of magics. Without, hordes of enemies threaten the realms of man.\nIn these troubled times heroes are few and far between. \nOn the isolated island of Idra, lies the Black Priory. Its great libraries were once a haven of enlightenment and wisdom. These days its halls see far darker practices. The Wizard Lord dispatches an elite group of his finest knights to bring Imperial justice to the accursed monastery.  \nHowever, all is nearly lost when disaster strikes on the high seas: The ship carrying the party is lost in a storm. All perish, save one: You.\n\nStranded on the shore of the bleak island, you are the people's last hope for Imperial justice!  \nGather what allies you can and prepare to face the Black Priory - pray your sanity holds!  \n\n\n The rewards for backing SKALD: Against the Black Priory span from digital copies of the game to awesome feelies and special rewards. \nThe feelies for SKALD: Against the Black Priory are heavily influenced by games like Ultima 4 (shown above). For illustration purposes only!\nThe Game\nBackers who recieve the game, get a DRM-free version of SKALD: Against the Black Priory for Windows or Mac shipped digitally and / or on a custom USB card. \n\nDemo and BETA\nBackers who get the demo will recieve it shortly after the Kickstarter campaign ends. The demo represents the ALPHA version of the game and is intended as proof of concept. \nThe closed BETA commences in late 2019. Backers who qualify will receive invitations as well as access to the \"BETA tester\" Discord channel. \nGame Map\nThe map will feature the games overland area. It will be hand-drawn and full color. Depending on tier. backers will receive it digitally, as a folded paper print or as a luxurious cloth map.  \n\nManual and Campaign Guide\nThe manual and campaign guide will, at a minimum, be a 32-page. soft-cover booklet with black and white illustrations. The manual will explain the rules and gameplay, whilst the campaign guide will serve as an introduction to the SKALD universe with an emphasis on the Gallian Empire and the Island of Idra with its locations and surroundings.\nBesides providing hints and context for the main game, the campaign guide will contain enough information that it will be possible to use the setting in a tabletop RPG campaign.  \nThe manual will be available in print and / or as a digital file depending on reward tier.\nConcept for the manual cover-art! Anyone get the D&D reference?\nDesign Rewards\nAt certain tiers, backers will be invited to participate in the design process for in-game content. Certain terms and conditions apply however: \nThe backer must be able to participate before the deadline of May 2020\nThe creator retains full creative control and retains the right to refuse all and any content not suitable within the game and setting\nThe creator may alter any submitted content as he sees fit\nThe backer will be credited if any content is used\n\nExclusive In-Game Content\n\"The Hermitage\" is a small Imperial safehouse in Idra where you will gain access to exclusive  items, recruitable NPCs and story content.\n\"The Lord of Idra\" will give you access to a sea-side estate that will give you access to unique resources and characters. \nBoth pieces of content may be released as add-ons to the original game down the line. \nT-Shirt\nT-shirt sizes will be requested and must be provided within the deadline (approx. May 2020). Failure to provide a size before the deadline means we may not be able to guarantee the size of your choice. \n\nWith the campaign blowing through the first 100% in less than 24 hours, it's now time to start thinking about stretch goals! We'll be publishing stretch-goals here as we go so stay posted! Goals so far:\n\n100% within 24-hours: Full Color Cover *COMPLETED* \nWe make the cover art for the manual full color!\n\n90.000 NOK: Mountains of Madness  *COMPLETED*  \nThe adventure extends beyond the isle of Idra, into the icy hellscape that is the northern polar regions. Its hostile climate, cyclopean ruins and Lovecraftian horrors will test your mettle as you sail into the eternal night of the high north!\n\n 105.000 NOK: The Captain class  *COMPLETED*  \nThe game is intended to ship with five \"canonical\" classes. If we reach 105.000 NOK I will design a sixth class:  \"The Captain\". The Captain is a combat based class with strong leadership skills and expert maritime and navigational skills.  \n\n 120.000 NOK / 13.800 USD:  The Port of Adler\u2019s Helm   *COMPLETED*  \nAdler\u2019s Helm is the northern-most Imperial provincial capital and the seat of Imperial power in the north. It\u2019s also the jumping off point for the expedition to Idra and the Black Priory!\nBy adding Adler\u2019s Helm to the game, I now get to make the game a three act piece: from the bleak isle of Idra, to the streets of Adler\u2019s Helm and the frozen hellscape of the high North! \n\n140.000 NOK / 16.000 USD: Vile Volumes  *COMPLETED*  \nIf we make our fourth stretch goal, we get to be a lot more ambitious with the manual / campaign guide! We planned to ship with approx. the equivalent of 3 pages of illustrations. If we make the mark we'll up that to  the equivalent of 6 pages in a 32 page manual! \nThis means we get to flesh out the city of Adler's Helm as well as add hand-drawn maps for locations and a fully illustrated bestiary of monsters! You'll be able to run a tabletop-RPG campaign in the SKALD universe! \nThis also means we can afford to pay an editor to give the book the polish it deserves! \n\n160.000 NOK / 18.400 USD: Infinite Darkness   *COMPLETED*  \nIf we make our fifth goal, we're adding a procedurally generated murder-dungeon to the game as optional side content! The area will be completely optional and besides the main game, and will allow you to create a party of up to 6 custom characters and take them on a doomed descent into an infinite dungeon. This will allow you to keep enjoying SKALD long after you've finished the main game! \n\n180.00 NOK /  21.000 USD: To be revealed!\n Should we add:\nA) Two more classes\nB) Bounty-hunting\nC) Crafting\nPoll on twitter now!\nI've been super lucky to have a group of extremely talented freelancers help bring the game to where it is today!\nMementoMoree has been creating art since his late teenage years. Proficient in most types of art, from pencil & paper to highly detailed 4k textures, he's found solace and pleasure in the retro pixel art! \nTwitter: @MementoMoree\n\nMarco Pedrana is a digital and traditional artist (illustration, storyboards, comic art, paintings, installations, pixel art), focusing on narrative art, regardless the media or the scope. He works in advertising and game design (Aeon of Sands: story, texts, graphics, audio, VCS testing). He loves D&D, his cat Agony, Spring, and the sounds coming from the meadow outside his window. \nIllustration: www.behance.net/marcopedrana  |  Fine art: marcopedrana.blogspot.com/ \n\nRomanus Surt is a Jack of all trades at Graverobber Foundation and the developer behind Das Geisterschiff. He did the music for the SKALD demo. \nTwitter:  @surt_r | Web:  Das Geistschiff on Steam \n\nEdwin Montgomery is a composer and sound designer for games, films and performance. A long-time RPG obsessive, he wrote the soundtrack for inXile's remastered release of \"Wasteland\" and is currently working on the 30th Anniversary version. He has created music and sounds for a variety of fantasy game worlds, including Warhammer 40,000, Game of Thrones and Neverwinter. Edwin did the sound design for the SKALD demo.\nTwitter: @edwinmmusic | Web:  www.edwinmontgomeryaudio.com \n\nSKALD is being developed in the SKALD engine. This is a home made engine written specifically for creating old-school, tile based RPGs for modern platforms. The engine is built on top of Unity and has access to Unity's powerful cross compiler. \nThe primary release for SKALD: Against the Black Priory is for Windows and Mac on Steam. Depending on how well the game is recieved I'll consider publishing on other desktop platforms as well as handheld devices. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith any project there is always a risk of the project failing to complete or severely under-performing. For SKALD the biggest risk stems from this being a solo-project. As a result, if something happens to me, there is nobody to fill my shoes and finish the project.\n\nThat being said, during the entire development process, I have adopted a stance of risk aversion. \n\nThe game is developed on Unity 3D: A leading and well established game development tool. Unity 3D is well supported in terms of having a large community and a robust technical support system. There is also every reason to believe that Unity 3D will remain supported in the future. \n\nFurthermore, an advantage to developing a retro-style game is that mechanics and graphics are considerably easier to produce for small teams. I keep a very strict line on avoiding feature creep, and the graphical constraints limit bloating on the production of art assets.\n\nThe same can be said for backer rewards: the focus is on keeping the (physical) rewards limited and easy to handle. My goal is, first and foremost, to bring you the actual game!\n\nFinally, development on SKALD: Against the Black Priory is already well under way and I maintain a playable build at all times. The demo of the game ALPHA version will be available July 2019 as a proof of concept.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge NOK 99 or more", "title": "Serf", "descp": "You get a copy of the game!

REACHED!\nA BIG THANK YOU to Scott Baker (4scottbaker@gmail.com) for making this video.  Music by Emmett Cooke.\nBOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY needs your help to print our new book, THE SCOURGE OF THE MECHANICAL MEN (A Granville Woods and Nikola Tesla story). It is a 34 page story in a 44 page perfect bound book, which means 10 pages of extras!\nIf you are new to the series, the original six issue mini-series is about an ex-Pinkerton detective, a spirit photographer, and a genius scientist who battle supernatural forces in late 1800\u2019s Boston. They live in an alternate steampunk history where ghosts and demons are a normal part of life. Families known as the Great Houses control the economy of the Great States of America while the middle class and lower classes sole purpose are to serve the Great Houses.\nTHE SCOURGE OF THE MECHANICAL MEN is a standalone continuation of the series written by Madeleine Holly-Rosing. Art, inking, and color are by Gwynn Tavares.\nTHE STORY\nGranville and Tesla are in a race for time to save Boston from a mysterious disease that turns human beings into machines.\nGranville returns home to Liberty Row only to find an almost insane Tesla hiding there. But his efforts to get rid of Tesla hit a snag when they discover that a virus is turning humans into soulless mechanical men. Realizing that Emily and Travis Morgan of Morgan Medicinals are behind the outbreak, they fear that the twins are after more than just control of Boston \u2013 They want to take over the Great States of America.\nEMILY AND TRAVIS MORGAN\nEmily, a brilliant scientist, has spent her life creating cures for other people and seeing none of the financial rewards or acknowledgement. Her brother Travis handles the business side of the company and resents that neither he nor his sister has ever been given their due.\nCan Granville and Tesla work together to save the city? Or will Boston and the Great States of America fall under the control of THE SCOURGE OF THE MECHANICAL MEN?\nCover art, inking, and color by Gwynn Tavares.\nThe entire story is off to our letterer, Troy Peteri, so here are the first three colored pages for you to see the amazing job that Gwynn has done.\n      NEW TO BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY?\nNo worries. The original trade paperback is available in several reward tiers.\n Cover art by Emily Hu. Color and inking by Gloria Caeli.\nWHAT'S IN THE TRADE?\nI'm glad you asked. Not only does it include all six issues from the mini-series as well as the cover art, but it also contains a Boston Metaphysical Society ten page short story called, Hunter-Killer, and additional bonus pages. With art by Emily Hu and coloring by Gloria Caeli, the story is set at the beginning of the House Wars (my version of the Civil War) and features the crew of a prototype airship. I introduce three new characters: Gwen Warrick - Captain; Emmet Rochester - Navigator; and Joaquin Medina - Engineer.\nAnd for what the story is about, well I have two words for you - Airship Battle!\nThe complete story of Hunter-Killer will ONLY be available in the trade.\nTHE MONEY:\nWhere the money goes...Your backing would enable us to pay for a print run of the book which means printing enough copies to send off to backers with some leftover to sell at conventions, incentives, shipping (which includes mailing envelopes, postage and handling.) And, of course, the fees (5% off the top, plus credit card fees.)\nTHE TEAM FOR THE SCOURGE OF THE MECHANICAL MEN:\nMadeleine Holly-Rosing - Writer/Creator: A TV, feature film, and comic book writer, Madeleine holds an MFA in Screenwriting from UCLA where she won numerous awards as well as the Sloan Fellowship.

Inspired by fantasy and the art of storytelling, Holly-Rosing uses her imagination to create a fantastic story that is both well-written and fearless.\" - Valerie Complex (Fansided)\n\"If you have a taste for an intelligent, well written, elegantly illustrated award winning independent book, you can't go wrong with Boston Metaphysical Society!\" - Alex Yarde (The Good Man Project)\n\"This very inventive series posits a totally believable Steampunk world that is populated by appealing characters who act (and react) in believable manners to the extraordinary events that swirl around them.\" - Robert Sodaro (Comic Reviewer at Examiner.com)\nThe original series was also nominated for Best Comic/Graphic Novel at the 2014 Geekie Awards.\nTHE STORY BEHIND THE STORY\nFor those of you who have read the original series, my version of Tesla is not what you usually see in fiction, but it does stay true to his obsessive nature. Granville was a real person and a contemporary of Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell. (He did business with both of them.) As a writer, I wanted to put my fictional versions of Granville and Tesla in the same room together for an extended period of time to see what would happen. Let\u2019s just say that Granville is more of a hard ass than I thought he was. This story allowed me to delve deeper into the lives of those who did not belong to a Great House, but were closer to the rest of us. Specifically, I wanted to show what it was like to live in Liberty Row, the middle class Negro neighborhood I created for this universe, and those whose work was used by the Great Houses, but never received any benefit for their effort.\nI love writing BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY. Not only does it bring my love of science fiction and history together, (which by the way, equals steampunk), the steampunk time period allows me to address the themes of classism, sexism, and racism in America in a thoughtful and entertaining way. For at its very core, BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY is an American story. And you can't tell an American story without including women and people of color.\nIt has been and always will be important to me to write characters who, though they come from diverse backgrounds and have different points of view, are able to work together for the common good.\nINCENTIVES\nIn addition to THE SCOURGE OF THE MECHANICAL MEN, we are offering the trade paperback which includes a brand new ten page story, a BRAND NEW bookmark, the anthologies, Boston Metaphysical Society: Prelude and Some Time Later, and a NEW BMS TRIQUETRA LAPEL PIN. It is 1 inch in diameter and will be an antique copper color.

I grew up watching cartoons and reading comic books. In December 2008 I found myself unemployed and decided to devote all of my free time to making silly comic books that featured robots and lizard creatures. Early 2009 saw me moving out to the desert at the request of my mother, to help with some family issues. During this bizarre, isolated time in the desert I finished a 32 page comic book of short stories starring Primus, a naive but well meaning robot with lizard creatures for parents. Over the next few years I wrote and doodled two other print issues that have somehow been purchased from people all over the world. I also have had short comics printed in zines/anthologies put together by others. In 2016 I successfully Kickstarted a paperback collection of the first three Scrambled Circuits minicomics, featuring commentary to go along with the stories.\n\nJust a few months after I decided I wanted to doodle, my comics were briefly talked about on the (now defunct) ART & STORY podcast (Listen Here). I had a short comic in an issue of the zine anthology Candy or Medicine that was reviewed on The Comics Journal website where I was called an \"artist to watch\" (Read Here) by reviewer Rob Clough. Rob would later do a more in depth review of the first four Scrambled Circuits issues on his own site (Read Here).\nWHAT I'M MAKING\nFor many years I have wanted to explore the anthology format. Through different mediums I have always enjoyed this format for it's flexibility in story telling. Whether on television, old time radio plays from the 50s, or the many printed prose and comic anthology series, I have just always been enchanted by them and slowly over time I found myself building a vision of what I wanted to do in the format. Then in October of 2016 I went to a group of creative people I have known for years and I rambled to them about what I wanted to make.\nIt was about an hour after being hired for a seasonal position that I went to this group. I have a full time job that (barely!) covers bills and the general cost of living. This second job was sought out for the sole purpose of ensuring I could handle all of the expenses a project like this would cost. A project that involves over a dozen contributors, scattered geographically all over the planet, as well as also some audio drama recording as well. These expenses are things like software/services, artist payments for art/stories/voice acting, renting a room for recording, dialog editing/sound engineering, etc. \nWhen that seasonal job ended I got a permanent second job to pay for this project. And now it is done. This first one is, at least.\nPLEDGE LEVELS & REWARDS\nEvery pledge level has US shipping factored in already.

My name is Dwight MacPherson and I'm the creator and writer of The Imaginary Voyages of Edgar Allan Poe. The reason we're Kickstarting this project is that we've been asked by several readers if our digital comics will ever be available in printed form. I get that not everyone is a fan of digital comics. Many people (like me) love the feel and smell of the printed page. So we decided to create this campaign and make our first printed comic book extra special. And by extra special, we mean a 28-page book that features a brand-new cover from Emmy-nominated Director/Producer/Illustrator, David Hartman, and a special four-page \"Making-Of\" section designed by author and illustrator, Tricia Martin. We decided to use Kickstarter so we can cover printing costs and pay our creative team something extra. It's a win-win situation!\nCover by David Hartman\n ABOUT THE BOOK\nThe Imaginary Voyages of Edgar Allan Poe is a reimagined version of the Harvey and Eagle Award-nominated graphic novel from Image Comics which features a revised script and eye-popping new art by the artist of the Bram Stoker Award-winning Kolchak the Night Stalker: The Forgotten Lore of Edgar Allan Poe, Luis Czerniawski. This is the first of 12 chapters/issues, and if we are successful with this campaign, the plan is to make all 12 issues available as Kickstarter-exclusive printed issues. \nBut let's not get ahead of ourselves. \nTHE STORY\nEdgar Allan Poe has lost everyone he ever loved and now he is losing his mind. Haunted by his wife's ghost and his many literary failures, the poet tumbles into a fantastical world created by his genius...and his madness. This world called Terra Somnium is a nightmare region that merges his macabre literary creations and mythological gods and monsters of old, all hell-bent on stopping him from escaping the land of dreams. \nWHAT IS IT SIMILAR TO?\nI've often described this story as \"Alice in Wonderland meets The Lord of the Rings.\" And for those who are fans of classic literature like myself, I would describe it as \"Homer's Odyssey meets Dante's Divine Comedy.\" \nINTERIOR ART: \nPage 1\n  Page 2\n  Page 3\n ENDORSEMENTS...\n\"Twisted and ominous, yet rich and charming. MacPherson has crafted a complex and enchanting story that blends the macabre and mythological into a strange dream land that is worthy of the great poet and author, Edgar Allan Poe.\" - American McGee, Creator and Designer of AMERICAN MCGEE'S ALICE, ALICE: MADNESS RETURNS, and GRIMM\n\"A beautiful and bizarre adventure into wonder, quirky, lovely and fascinating!\" - Kurt Busiek, Multiple Eisner Award-winning creator of ASTRO CITY \n\"Together in one package, two of the great passions of my youth (that didn\u2019t end there); comics and Edgar Allan Poe. A thrilling adventure with beautiful art. More, please!\" - Roderick Gordon, Author of the New York Times Bestselling TUNNELS series \n\"A glimpse into the enigmatic dreamscape where the great chronicler of mystery and madness, Edgar Allan Poe, meets acclaimed comic creator Dwight L.

There\u2019s a vibrant world in here, and the creative team bring it to life deftly.\"\nOliver Gerlach, Comic Bastards.\n\"The Demon Archives is a fantastic webcomic. Really good science fiction, high-concept kinda cyberpunk stuff ... I can't recommend the comic enough, it's really good. It's one of the better webcomics out there, in my opinion.\"\nThe Awesome Comics Podcast.\nShort Description:\nAfter 5 years of publishing The Demon Archives online, we're proud to finally announce we're doing a print run! The Demon Archives: Volume 1- The Battle of Arkjut is a compilation of the prologue and first 3 chapters of the webcomic, brought together into a single bound book. 7x10 inches in size and over 100 full-color pages long, you KNOW you want a copy.\nWe've made a couple of test copies, and found a great local printer who will do a larger batch, but we need YOUR help to raise the money necessary for their minimum order requirements.\nWho We Are:\nDaniel Sharp is an MD/PhD student who sometimes wishes he'd picked a career path that didn't involve 14 years of post-bachelor's training. He started writing The Demon Archives in a creative fiction class he took in his senior year of undergrad, regularly bouncing ideas off of his older brother, Nick.\nNick Sharp is a web-developer and programmer at Amazon, which luckily for us means he knows how to build and manage our website, AND has the discretionary income to pay our artist, Seba.\nSebasti\u00e1n P\u00edriz is a freelance artist and illustrator from Argentina who somehow juggles a dozen different projects at once and still finds the time to crank out \"warm up\" sketches that make Dan and Nick weep in jealousy.\nThe Goal:\nWe've done the math, and if we can raise $3500 we can meet the minimum quantity requirements of our printer of choice. By using media mail we can keep shipping costs down, so we've made shipping free for all US backers,and only $10 to Canada, and $20 to the rest of the world.\nAll the art in the book is already produced and paid for, so literally all that the $3500 has to go to is Kickstarter fees, printing costs and shipping. If we manage to raise more? Well, we'll get to stretch goals in a bit ;)\nThe Story:\nIf by some miracle you don't already read the comic (hint, you should, it's free), then a short introduction to the story might be in order.\nThe Demon Archives is a full-color post-apocalyptic sci-fi graphic novel set in 22nd century Earth, 100 years after World War 3 and the collapse of global civilization.\nThe story takes place in the new nation-state of Minerva, a high-tech society based around bunkers in Kyrgyzstan that survived the devastation, preserving the knowledge and culture of the past.\nWe follow our protagonist, Tenzin Dorje, Captain of Minerva's top military squad, the Keleres, and his prototype AI assisstant, Jane, as they embark on a mission to a nearby city under Minerva's protection, Arkjut.\nWhat they discover there will threaten not only the survival of the Keleres (power armor and all!), but Minerva itself.\nThe Rewards:\nStretch Goals:\n$3500 is what we need to make this project a reality, but we have some great ideas for if we can raise more. I'll wait to give you the full details until we meet our basic funding, but I'm thinking fancier books, coloring books with your very own pack of red crayons, printed version of the Nightshade short stories, and more!\nEDIT: We've reached 50% funding, and unlocked the announcement of our first stretch goal!\n More will be unlocked as we reach the Main Goal!\nAdd-ons:\nThe listed reward tiers not quite got what you want? No worries! If you've pledged at one of the physical tiers ($15 and above, plus shipping) you can simply increase your pledge to account for any mix of the following:\n$15 - 8.5x11 inch poster of a chapter cover\n$25 - Another copy of the book\n$50 - Custom commission by Seba\n(So if you have pledged at the $25 tier and want a second copy, just raise your pledge to $50, etc)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe story is already complete, the pages drawn, and test prints made. We've already gotten quotes from a great US-based printer, so we know the costs to expect, and getting our shipment of prints won't run into international shipping issues.

Comic publishers produced dozens of titles throughout the 1950s and 60s, and many of the medium\u2019s top artistic talents worked in romance comics. For a number of reasons, romance comics all but died out. But we\u2019re bringing them back with the help of amazing independent comics artists! \nThis final volume will be our biggest book yet, featuring more artists than ever before. Join us as we explore love, connection, and the limits of speculative fiction! \nTHE BOOK \nComics are best enjoyed in book form. We plan to release another beautiful book, 6\u201dx9\u201d, perfect bound, offset printed, 180 pages, black and white, with a color cover. This will fit perfectly on the shelf with volumes 1 & 2, making a wonderful collection of sci-fi romance comics to be enjoyed for years to come. \nTHE ARTISTS \nJust like the first two volumes, we have gathered a diverse group of independent comics creators to share their visions with you. Volumes 1 & 2 featured some of the most incredible new creators in comics, and many of them have continued on to become some of the top talent working today. We strongly encourage you to check out this volume, as we are sure that we have found another batch of comic creators with bright futures! With 19 creators, this will be the largest number we\u2019ve showcased yet. \n Barrett Stanley, \u201cPriorities\u201d \nThe work of Barrett Stanley of Greensboro, NC is imbued with a sense of fun and rendered in meticulous line work. He\u2019s already a veteran of one successful Kickstarter campaign for Heartbreak Quadrant, his fun and stylish action sci-fi comic. \n heartbreakquadrant.tumblr.com, instagram@barrettcomics \nJohn Vestevich, \u201cKill Me If You Can\u201d \nCurrently living in Michigan (after a short but welcome stint in Chicago), John is constantly pushing his work into new territories. His comics are marked by experimentation, humor, and stylistic variation. We recommend you check out his mini comics Partners, a. afarensis, and Smelly Hippy Comics. \nwww.johnvestevich.com, twitter@JohnVestevich, instagram@johnvestevich \nDrew, of Meaty Comics, \u201cLunar Tryst\u201d \nCurrently living in New York City, Drew is a graduate of Ringling College of Art and Design. His work has a firm grounding in figure drawing, but with the kinetic feeling of 80\u2019s action movies and martial arts films. His knack for creating mood and portraying movement have wowed us ever since first seeing his work. \ntwitter@meatycomics, Instagram@meatycomics \nMax & Morrow Dowdle, \u201cStarscape\u201d \nMax is the artist behind the successfully Kickstartered comics Shattered with a Curve of Horn and An Unlikely Refugee. His work showcases beautifully rendered figures and mind-bending plots. Check out his work! \ntwitter@maxdowdle, instagram@maxdowdle, MaxDowdle.com \nLandis Blair, \u201cA Toasted Passion\u201d \nThe unicycle-riding, bow-tie wearing, cross-hatching genius Landis Blair currently lives in Chicago, IL. Most recently, Landis completed illustrating The Hunting Accident, a huge comic volume to be released by First Second books next year. Additionally, Landis regularly creates twisted dark humor mini comics reminiscent of Edward Gorey. \ntwitter@LandisBlair, instagram@landisblair, www.landisblair.com \n Beck Kramer, \u201cReprise\u201d \nBeck is another Chicago comicker. She's already been doing a wonderful sci-fi romance comic online called Relativity, exploring what happens to a relationship when FTL travel is involved. Her work is subtle and precise, warranting repeat readings. \ntwitter@beckkramer, relativitycomic.com, beckkramer.com \n M.L. MacDonald, \u201cBlood and Stars\u201d \nJoining us from Canada is drawing virtuoso Alchemichael. We were wowed by his work in on Heart of Weirdness and excited to see him contributing to Island from Image comics. His clean and detailed work brings to mind Moebius and Enki Bilal. \ntwitter@Alchemichael77, instagram@alchemichael, alchemichael.tumblr.com \nAmara Leipzig, \u201cTrustband\u201d \nAmara is the creator of experimental comics Other Side, Night Blanket, and The Fifth Window (from Kilgore books). Their work is both meditative and exploratory, reading almost like a poem written in physics. Amara is an alumni of Speculative Relationships Vol 2. \ninstagram@amaraleipzig, amaraleipzig.tumblr.com, www.amaraleipzig.com \nKawai Shen, \u201cLa Dame Bleue\u201d \nBoth a comics artist and pundit, Kawai\u2019s work explores the surreal, erotic, philosophical aspects of comics. Her clean line style and wonderful prose can be seen in The Book of Mutations & Kawai\u2019s Guide to Cat Calling. Her story for Volume 3 is written in memory of fashion icon Isabella Blow. \ntwitter@kawaishen, cutejuicecomics.com \n M.R. Trower, \u201cI've Got You\u201d \nAn alumni of Volume 2, M.R. Trower hails from North Carolina and is the creator of the beautiful comics REM & Bad Dog. Their comics feature unique narratives which explore identity and challenge oppressive societal structures. M.R. is also the curator of anthology zines The Future and Encounters. \ntwitter@inkmaggot, Remcomic.tumblr.com, Mrtrower.com \n Roxanne Palmer, \u201cAction At A Distance\u201d \nFormer science journalist for the International Business Times, Roxanne is currently a student of the Sequential Arts Workshop in Gainesville, FL. Her work draws inspiration from science, but that doesn't stop her from drawing some fantastic monsters. \ntwitter@redrawnoxen, roxydrew.tumblr.com \nKitty Curran, \u201cMeanwhile, Deep in the Heart of the Evil Empire...\u201d \nFormerly from \u2018across the pond\u2019 in England, Kitty now resides in good ol\u2019 Chicago. Her work is playful and elegant, reminding us of classic romance and the best children\u2019s books of our youth. She is the co-creator and illustrator of the uber-successful mega-hilarious Taylor Swift: Girl Detective. \ntwitter@kittycurran, kittycurran.tumblr.com \nWill Tempest, \u201cDistance\u201d \nWill\u2019s art has appeared in Zero and Material, both from Image Comics. He has also worked with Liam Cobb and Tom Kemp on the beautiful risographed anthology Silica Burn. His work is precise as he builds worlds of interesting creatures and environments. We\u2019re stoked to have him on board, representing the UK! \nInstagram@willt01, Twitter@Will_Tempest, willtempest.tumblr.com \nAndrew Miscisco, \u201cHarper Infinity\u201d \nAndrew describes himself as a world-builder and that can\u2019t be denied. His work is populated with fantastic beasts and monsters from the mists of a forgotten time. Despite the gritty settings, Andrew\u2019s art is clear, bright, and readable. \nInstagram@andrewmisisco, twitter@AndrewMisisco, andrewmisisco.wixsite.com/misiscoart \n Matthew Sargent, \u201cFuture Roommate\u201d \nMatthew\u2019s work explores many genres, featuring crisp clean cartooning, and a healthy sense of humor. He is most known for his comic Bag Drop, a workplace comedy set on a golf course. \ntwitter@mbsargent, instagram@skippinginfinity, skippinginfinity.com\nJacob Bouvet, w/Amanda Johnson & Nikki Sherman, \u201cDutifully Broken Hearted\u201d \nBringing some mech-love (cuz who can resist that) is writer Jacob Bouvet, illustrator Amanda Johnson, & letterer Nikki Sherman. This super team of creators is active on the website The Comic Jam. We know you\u2019ll love what they have collaborated on for us! \ntwitter@PopFenton (Jacob), jacobbouvet.com, instagram@nyxish (Amanda), twitter@fivxxfive (Nikki)   \nCover by Jose Moreno \nProviding the cover to Speculative Relationships: Volume 3 is the incredible Jose Moreno! Jose is an illustrator and master book-maker living in northern California. His illustrations are immediately striking, featuring unique color palettes and beautiful figures. We think his cover is the perfect closing to our sci-fi romance anthology! \ntwitter@jamorenoart, instagram@jamorenoart, www.jamoreno.com \nTHE REWARDS \nThe Books:\n All 3 volumes of Speculative Relationships are 6\"x9\", offset printed, perfect bound, with black & white interiors and color covers.  Volume 1 is 80 pages, Volume 2 is 136 pages, and Volume 3 weighs in at an enormous 180 pages of content!\nVolume 1 features stories from:\nDaniel Warren Johnson\nMike Manomivibul\nIsabella Rotman\nRinko Endo\nTyrell Cannon\nScott Kroll\nVolume 2 features stories from:\nLiam Cobb\nGrim Wilkins\nEzra Claytan Daniels w/Ben Passmore\nMax & Morrow Dowdle\nRich Foster\nDaniel Warren Johnson\nBeck Kramer\nAmara Leipzig\nMike Manomivibul\nIsabella Rotman\nM.R. Trower\nKat Verhoeven\nTyrell Cannon\nScott Kroll\nNone of these stories are available anywhere else!\n...\nThe Prints:\nWe've had some incredible cover artists involved in Speculative Relationships, including Mike Manomivibul (volume 1), Sandra Lanz (volume 2), and Jose Moreno (volume 3).  Each cover image is printed sans-logo, so you can appreciate the beautiful art on its own.  All are 8.5\"x11\", digital prints, on heavy paper stock. \nTyrell Cannon's print was created specifically for this final volume's campaign and has not been released before!  It is printed to the same specifications as the other prints, so they can all be displayed side by side.\n...\nThe Making Love zine:\nOur \"Making Love\" zines have been a fan favorite since Volume 1.  It's your behind the scenes look into the work that goes into creating comics and putting together an anthology.  You'll see sketches from the artists, thumbnails for pages, preliminary designs for the cover, and even some candid email exchanges. The zines are printed old school on black & white xerox machines, then hand-bound and numbered by the editors.  \nKawai Shen Postcards:\nSR3 artist Kawai Shen has presented an intimate reward for you with two tantalizing postcards.  Each pair is scented with one of her favourite niche perfumes, all murderously expensive.  She will personalize one card per backer, including a small (naughty?) drawing on the back.  Only 5 rewards available! \nThe PDFs\nWe give you high resolution, DRM-free PDFs for easy sharing across all your reading devices in the household.  \nWHERE THE MONEY GOES \nThe money is all for printing the book, backer rewards, and shipping. And then some extra to go to Kickstarter & Amazon (as usual). Much like our last campaign, we feel that money raised in excess of our goal should be passed on to the artists, as compensation for creating these wonderful stories (all artists have created their stories for FREE). We have a few stretch goals in mind, all of which will enhance the book. Think spot varnish, embossing, rich black inks, and individual book numbers! We are excited to be working with a well-established and Kickstarter experienced printer: Print Ninja. With their help we hope to bring you the best quality book possible. The books will be printed overseas, so this will make the expected delivery a little further out than a U.S. printer, but we think it\u2019ll be worth the wait.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGetting proofs of the book and making it look JUST RIGHT for our backers is very important, so that process could possibly take longer than expected. However, we plan to work our hardest to minimize any delays.\nWe learned a lot on our last two campaigns regarding shipping. Additionally, we have quite a few Kickstarter vets in our book who have also given us lots of helpful advice to make our processes as efficient as possible. Again, the delivery will be slightly delayed compared to our previous campaigns, as we wait for books to arrive from out of the country.

I've had the pleasure of working with some of my favorite artists over the past two years in bringing these stories to fruition, and - with your help - we'll be all set to take this anthology to print.\nI owe many thanks to Chan Chau, Julian Adkins, John Adkins, Maria Frantz, Julie Godwin and Devin Kraft for helping make this project a reality. Their hard work and dedication can be seen in every single page of this book. Each of them brings a unique art style to the book, and it's fascinating to see their different interpretations of the character designs. I have linked their names to their previous work, so you can have and idea of what to expect in the anthology.\nBelow is a small preview of what they've created for Galahad and the Far-Off Horizon. As our campaign progresses, we will showcase each artist and what they've brought to the project.\n   The beautiful wrap-around cover was painted by Julian Adkins, and Emily Osborne designed the vibrant endpapers. \n    The Garden of Galahad is a story about love and dedication. Galahad, an enchanted suit of armor, carries out the wishes of its master until the young witch Brynne interrupts its peaceful routine. Over hills, by seasides and past the ruins of old castles, the pair embark on the journey of a lifetime. Julian Adkins beautifully illustrates these pages with flatting assists by John Adkins. This story is 49 pages long and introduces the world in which all the following stories are set. Click here for a preview of the first ten pages.\n   The four short stories, illustrated by Chan, Devin, Maria, and Julie, explore the backgrounds of key characters before The Garden of Galahad and help flesh out the world they live in. \nThe Witches Laugh (8 pages) introduces us to a powerful coven.\nBroken Keep (14 pages) looks back at the early life of Galahad's creator, Lance.\nTougher Than The Hills (26 pages) uncovers a mistake Brynne made in her youth.\nWhen Magic Was Free (14 pages) details the tragic beginning of the series antagonist.\nAlong with the five stories that comprise the anthology, there are companion illustrations and a character gallery featuring artwork from some amazing folks. I'll be posting a few of these as the campaign rolls on. \nDigital and printed versions of Galahad and the Far-Off Horizon, as well as several different digital bundles are available now. \nThere's also some extra goodies to choose from - postcards and posters - if you'd like even more of Galahad and the Far-Off Horizon in your life.\nThe wonderful Meredith McClaren has donated 20 hardcover copies of Hinges Book 1: Clockwork City. This is beautiful book collects the first chapter of Meredith's webcomic and each copy is signed and sketched.Grab one while you can! We are so very greatful for Meredith's donation and her support of our project.\nAs a thank you for your support in this project I am making two mini comics I've written, Adventures in Nate's Perilous Challenge illustrated by Jack Gross and Mother Made us to Die illustrated by Marek Jarocki available to all physical backers at $5 for the pair. You can click through on the titles and see a preview. Just add $5 to your pledge with a physical reward and both of these comics are yours!\nWe also have two original art tiers from Christa Dippel and Kristeen Parmeter and one digital commission from Julian Adkins, so be quick to jump on those if you're interested. These are available for international shipping as soon as the campaign launches.  \n  As you can see, most of the Kickstarter funds will be dedicated to printing, with a couple thousand going to Kickstarter fees and shipping out rewards. We are not relying on funding to pay the artists; they have been compensated prior to the campaign. However, if the Kickstarter is funded beyond all of the stretch goals (i.e. past $20,000), a portion of the excess funds will be divided among the creators.\n   Thank you so much for reading all the way through this.

And it all starts with this deck of obscure movie monster playing cards.\nWhat do I get for backing this?\nYou will receive an entertaining pack of playing cards featuring illustrations of obscure movie monsters. It could be that you\u2019ve seen one or two of these creepy creatures. You\u2019ll quickly be captivated as you flip through the cards. You may begin playing with the monsters before you start playing a game. Can you remember where and when you saw that green thing? Is it an old creature feature of the fifties or something more recent? As you flip through the cards, you will have the urge to compare your movie trivia with others. Their laughter is your reward as you share these maligned movie monsters. \nStretch Goal Rewards\nBecause of various stretch goals being achieved supporters will also receive: Four screen savers done by guest artists, and a set of four Horror Movie Bingo Cards.

I'm happy withe the quality. But I've been asked by card collectors to increase the quality further if I could. Reaching this new stretch goal would allow for that upgrade. And with how well the project has been going, it's a goal that can be achieved.\nInternational Shipping\nWhile all of the levels have USA and Canada shipping calculated, only a few award levels are calculated for International Shipping. I've added these on a case-by-case basis. If you live outside North America and would like to support, please let me know what country and at what award level and I will arrange it with an edit.

With help from the backers the content for card boxes has been taken care of.\n\nAll of the artwork and production for the initial project has been completed. The challenge has always been to create this deck at an affordable price point per unit. Reaching the project\u2019s goal will ensure this. An even larger challenge is to push into stretch goals so that with each backer, the print run can be increased. Packaging design has been completed for the individual decks. Should there be a strong demand for half and full brick order then packaging can be designed for display boxes that hold six and twelve decks.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Deck of Cards", "descp": "A pack of cards\u2014they\u2019re so beautiful.\nEnjoy your quality deck of obscure movie monsters.

Scroll down to see what we've got to unlock!\n  Peter Simeti here, founder and publisher of Alterna Comics and in case you haven't heard, we're bringing back newsprint comics in a big way this May (as covered by Newsarama) as we've also just brokered a distribution deal with PDG to distribute our comics to newsstands across the world. \nSo why single issues and why newsprint?  It's true that Alterna's only published a handful of single issue titles in our eleven years and that we've mostly published graphic novels and digital comics -- but the answer is a simple one.  I've been looking for a newsprint printer since I started Alterna and until we found one, I really didn't want to move forward with printing single issues on premium paper. Some exceptions were made over the years but by and large, it wasn't a direction I wanted to fully pursue. But finally, the search is over.\nSo why was the search so difficult? Newsprint is a really thin paper and because of that, it's only printed on a web press.  Web press printing is generally only affordable once you hit a range in the tens of thousands, while traditional offset printing can take thicker, premium paper stocks at minimum runs of 500 to 1000.  The small runs are more appealing to comic publishers sadly due to the fact that the current distribution system can make it hard at times to sell more than that.  Comic books just aren't everywhere like they used to be and the fact that merchandise is sold on a non-returnable basis to retailers means that your local comic shop has to be very choosy with the books they stock on their shelves.  It leaves a lot of purchasing up to speculation and the harsh reality is that the average Marvel or DC title is just less of a risk than the average independent comic.  So for whatever reason, when it came to newsprint, I decided to reach out to grocery store circular printers, catalog printers, magazine printers, and local town paper printers - we ended up finding a few printers that could do exactly what we needed.  It's ironic that we had to look outside traditional comic book printing companies to find a printer that could print a traditional comic book.\nWhy the low cover price of $1.50 an issue? Can that last? It absolutely will as we found that printing costs on newsprint are about 3 times less for these runs, so we're passing on those savings to retailers and readers.  We're also selling very affordable advertising to support the runs of these books and we're allowing other comic creators and publishers to advertise as well -- another break from the traditional in-house only ads of most modern comics. \nYou can see our first four offerings right here, available for pre-order at your local comic shop now. Read more about them below:\nADAM WRECK - created by Michael S. Bracco; this space adventure comic is a 3 issue mini series that is great for all ages and combines the feel of \"Lost in Space\" and \"Star Wars\".\nAMAZING AGE - created by Matthew D. Smith, Jeremy Massie, and Christine Brunson; combining \"Stranger Things\" and superheroes in this 5 issue mini series, three teenagers have to save the universe after getting sucked into the comic book world they created as kids.\nLILITH DARK - created by Charles Dowd; in this 4 issue mini series, Lilith Dark discovers that the monsters and beasties of her imagination are actually real and she must brave impossible odds to rescue her family before it's too late!\nCROAK - created by Cody Andrew Sousa, Francesco Iaquinta, Chris O'Halloran, and Dezi Sienty; in this 3 issue thrill ride, three friends get lost deep in the woods where their worst nightmares come to horrifying life.\n  Our second wave of titles will release to comic shops in June:  \nMOTHER RUSSIA - created by Jeff McComsey; a soviet sniper comes face to undead face with a zombie apocalypse during World War 2 in this alternate universe tale that takes place over 3 issues.  \nTHE CHAIR - created by Peter Simeti and Kevin Christensen; an innocent man on death row must find a way to save his life and his sanity before it's too late. Unfortunately, the prison's sadistic Warden and his murderous guards have other things in mind.  A film adaptation starring the late Roddy Piper, Zach Galligan, Naomi Grossman, Bill Oberst Jr. and Noah Hathaway is slated for a DVD & blu-ray release this Fall.  \nTRESPASSER - created by Justin M. Ryan, Kristian Rossi, and DC Hopkins; one father will go to unspeakable lengths to protect his daughter after a strange visitor crash lands in the forest. This 4 issue mini series is perfect for fans of \"The Walking Dead\" and \"The X-Files\".  \nSCRIMSHAW - created by Eric Borden, Dave Mims, and Spike O'Laochdha; the only ongoing series in Alterna's newsprint lineup! Cyborgs, pirates, cut-throats and mutants are the good guys in this action-packed series about a team of post-apocalyptic mercenaries.\n  Aside from distributing through Diamond Comics Distributors so that your favorite local comic shops will have these books on shelves, we've also secured a deal for newsstand distribution.  In fact - comic shops will have these books two months earlier than newsstands will as it's our way of saying thanks to all the shops that have supported us for our eleven years and giving respect to the retailers that have been the lifeblood of the comic industry. \nSince the books will be on a bi-monthly schedule (a series will release every two months until completion) by the time issue #1 is on newsstands, issue #2 will be in comic shops.  This will allow newsstand readers to seek out more titles in the comic shop and immediately get the next issue there if they wish.\nThe addition of newsstand availability also brings me to the reason why I'm running this Kickstarter to begin with.\nWhile we budgeted for the print runs that will go toward comic shops, we weren't able to foresee the budget costs of expanded print runs for newsstand distribution (this is relatively uncharted territory) or the cost of BIPAD numbers (unique - and costly - UPC numbers required by the magazine industry) and because of those two factors, we're hoping that the Kickstarter community will come out to support our endeavor as we'll be the first creator-owned publisher in decades to have comic books available on newsstands.  Newsstand publications also have to have different bar codes than their comic shop counterparts, which adds another bit of a road bump.  That's because the newsstand industry has a standard 2 digit supplement code and comic book distribution has a 5 digit supplement code.  The cost to print different covers is minimal (interiors will remain the same) but it's still something that we need to do.\nThe BIPAD numbers are about $150 each, which set us behind on our budget by $3K as we needed 20 of these to move forward with newsstand distribution (yes, that's right, we'll be releasing at least 20 newsprint comics over the next two years+!) - so the first $3K raised will go towards filling that unexpected expense.  The next $2K will go towards supporting increased print run numbers for our first 4 books.  \nSo as long as we reach our goal of $5K we'll be all set to move forward - but it'd be great if we could raise more, as every $1K raised will unlock a small BONUS stretch reward for every backer (stickers, trading card, pins, coasters, window clings, signed mini-poster) and every $2K raised will unlock the ability to purchase a larger stretch reward at a discounted price (tote bags, shirts, beanies). The extra funding will also enable us to securely move forward on future increased print runs, and support them fully with advertising and promotional materials for your favorite comic shops and stores.  From that point on, the line should be self-sustaining.\nUNLOCKED -- $5500 unlocks a random FREE newsprint comic from one of the four pictured below for EVERY backer that pledges for a physical reward!\nUNLOCKED -- $6000 unlocks an \"I Love Comics\" sticker for all backers that pledge for a physical reward!\n$7000 unlocks a 3\"x4\" \"I Love the Smell of Comics on a Wednesday\" clear window cling for all backers that pledge for a physical reward!  For backers that pledge $30 or more, you'll also receive an \"I Love the Smell of Comics on a Wednesday\" tote bag, a perfect bag for visits to the comic shop or when you go to a convention!\n$8000 unlocks a few Alterna Comics button pins for all backers that pledge for a physical reward!\n$9000 unlocks an Alterna Comics trading card, exclusive just for Kickstarter backers that pledge for a physical reward!  For backers that pledge $35 or more, you'll also receive an Alterna Comics fitted beanie!\n$10000 unlocks an Alterna Comics coaster for all backers that pledge for a physical reward!\n$11000 unlocks a signed 11x17 mini-poster for all backers that pledge for a physical reward! For backers that pledge $40 or more, you'll also receive either an \"I Love the Smell of Comics on a Wednesday\" t-shirt or an Alterna Comics t-shirt -- sizes run from Men's S to 4XL!\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere's really no risk here - I've helped dozens of Kickstarter projects succeed as well as a few of my own - and the books WILL be made, distribution IS in place.

Faced with a new century and new steam technology, the social and political status quo is turned on its head. People are uncomfortable with change and, in fact, many people fear it. That fear and the violence which follows causes a psychic rift to puncture the veil of space and time allowing the entity known as \"The Shifter\" to escape. Feeding on the resentment and fear between the rich and poor, \u201cThe Shifter\u201d triggers a rash of murders.\nFour of the greatest minds of the time have banded together to try and stop this malevolent entity. Known only as B.E.T.H., they are:\n THEY FAIL.\nAgainst their better judgment, they look to a man driven by revenge \u2013 SAMUEL HUNTER.\n For the one mistake \"The Shifter\" made was killing Samuel\u2019s wife.\nAn ex-Pinkerton detective, Samuel gathers his unlikely team of\u2026\nCaitlin O'Sullivan, Medium and Spirit Photographer:\n and Granville Woods, Scientist Extraordinaire:\n They are the Boston Metaphysical Society.\nTheir job: Stop \"The Shifter\" before Boston tears itself apart.\nCOVER OF THE TRADE.\nCOVER ART BY EMILY HU.

Not only does it bring my love of science fiction and history together, (which by the way, equals steampunk), the steampunk time period allows me to address the themes of classism, sexism, and racism in America in a thoughtful and entertaining way. For at it's very core, BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY is an American story. And you can't tell an American story without including women and people of color.\nIt has been and always will be important to me to write characters who, though they come from diverse backgrounds and have different points of view, are able to work together for the common good.\nBOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY began as a TV Pilot which I wrote while I was in the MFA Program in Screenwriting at UCLA. It was somewhat inspired by a script I had written called Stargazer, which was about a real life astronomer who lived in Boston in the late 1880's. (Stargazer went on to win the Sloan Fellowship.) It was suggested that I adapt Boston Metaphysical into a six issue graphic novel mini-series. I agreed and the hunt was on for an artist. Many months later, I met Emily Hu through a mutual friend and a partnership was born. Her passion for the project matched my own and I knew the story was in good hands. I launched BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY as a webcomic in May of 2012. The following year we printed a special edition of the first chapter.\nThrough a combination of self-funding and the generous support of Kickstarter backers like you, we were able to finish the six issue series and now we are back to print this expanded version of the trade.\nHowever by wading into the deep end of the pool, I discovered a terrible truth \u2013 I love writing comics.\nSo I bring you Samuel, Caitlin, and Granville who represent the best, the worst, and every shade of gray of the society in which they live. They are products of their world yet strive for not only more, but better.\nMuch like you and I.\nBy backing this project, you would not only be supporting the printing of the trade paperback, but a vision of a future where the teamwork and sacrifice of a diverse group of individuals ultimately defeats evil.\nINCENTIVES\nIn addition to the 156 page trade paperback which includes a brand new ten page story, we have a BRAND NEW bookmark, the anthology, Boston Metaphysical Society: Prelude, scripts of the new ten page story (pdf and in hardcopy), plus a NEW LAPEL PIN with Caitlin's box camera. It is 1 inch in diameter and will be an antique gold color. (See image below.)\nSample Image from Proof - Pin will be ordered after the campaign is funded\n(A big thank you to Bill Meahan for handling the technical aspects of designing the pin.)\nLapel Pin Set\nAnd for the first time, we will be offering a reward tier which includes the set of all three Boston Metaphysical pins (Dirigible, Tesla, and the 1800's Box Camera) in a lovely gift box with our logo.\nImage is for demonstration only. The set will include the following pins: Dirigible, Nikola Tesla, 1800's Box Camera. (Box Camera Pin will be ordered once the campaign is funded.)\nAnd if you haven't read Boston Metaphysical Society:Prelude yet, then this would be the perfect time to get it. This anthology of short stories and novellas includes stories of how Granville and Samuel met and their first case together; what set Caitlin on her path; and how Samuel met his wife, Elizabeth Weldsmore Hunter. Several reward tiers include it as either a pdf or print version.\nCover of Boston Metaphysical Society: Prelude\nNEW REWARD GOAL!\nGet Your Airship Wings\nJoin the flight crew of \"The Philadelphia.\" Inspired by the new short story, Hunter-Killer, these light weight pins with metal accessories are perfect for any steampunk costume.

The book is narrated by Nathaniel as he tells his story to Detective Sullivan Carver after confessing to a murder. Told in two 22 page issues, Closer is a mystery/thriller about family, faith, and what we would do to have our deepest desire met. \nWrite/Editor: J.M. Bryan.

This book is part of Kickstarter's Make 100 campaign, and only 100 copies will ever be printed!\nPresidents Reagan, Taylor, Cleveland, and Johnson (Andrew)\nIn 2016 I traveled across the country, selling an earlier version of the sketchbook at conventions and shows at a dozen cities. In a turbulent political year, the sketchbook provided a friendly and apolitical outlet for people to talk about the presidency. Now with a new Commander-In-Chief being sworn in I'm hoping Kickstarter will help make this updated, improved edition a reality!\nIn addition to adding the new President, I'll be updating many of the older sketches I was unhappy with. Chester A. Arthur, I'm looking at you!\nNOT MY PRESIDENT EDITION\nOf the 100 sketchbooks, 25 will have a special custom bookplate sticker, with the President (or Wannabe President) of your choosing! You can put it in the inside cover of the book, or cover up one of the Presidents you really don't care for!\nMaaaaaybe you weren't happy with the outcome of the election, Or maybe you just want a support a rising talent! These are one-of-a-kind pen and ink sketches of the Commander-In-Chief you've always wanted!\nNot Presidents Vermin Supreme, Alexander Hamilton, Hillary Clinton, and Michael Dukakis\nWHO ARE YOU?\nI'm Josh Trujillo and I'm a cartoonist and writer based in Los Angeles, California. My work mostly focuses on comic books, and in the past year I've had several projects tied to patriotism and the presidency. In addition to 45 AMERICAN PRESIDENTS I also released a Revolutionary War romance comic, DECLARATION, with artist Levi Hastings, and wrote ADVENTURE TIME: PRESIDENT BUBBLEGUM for Boom! Studios and Cartoon Network, with artist Phillip Murphy.\nMy comics work, me, and my good friend Teddy.\nYou may also know my comic series LOVE MACHINES, and the tabletop gaming anthology DEATH SAVES: FALLEN HEROES OF THE KITCHEN TABLE. Both projects launched here successfully thanks to the engaged and passionate audience on the site.\nAmerican institutions are important to me, as is our proud democracy. While I may have views of my own, I hope this work appeals to people from all ends of the political spectrum.\nPresidents Harrison, McKinley, Nixon, and Garfield\nWHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?\nNearly of the money will go directly to our All-American printer! The remainder of the funds will allow us to fulfill our pledged Kickstarter rewards, cover miscellaneous production/promotional fees, and cushion us in case shipping costs go over (they often do!) I just want to have an updated version of my sketchbook! Hopefully you do, too!\nPresidents Taft, Fillmore. Clinton, and Harding\nSTRETCH GOALS\nJust getting the limited-edition book printed would be a dream come true! Here are some thoughts on where to go next!\n$1,200 - TECHNICAL PRESIDENTS: Did you know that while George W. Bush got a colonoscopy Dick Cheney was made Official Acting President of the United States? Did you know this happened twice? I'd like to add additional pages of bonus material, to highlight the obscure grab bag of Sorta Kinda Presidents who have served their country.\n$1,600 - POSTER: I will make a very pretty poster (11x17, folded) of the 45 American Preidents! You could donate it to your favorite school, or keep it for yourself!\n\n$2,000 - HARDCOVER EDITION: If we sell a complete run of 45 AMERICAN PRESIDENTS it will be upgraded to a beautiful hardcover edition, so that it can live on forever and ever! Small batch hardcovers aren't cheap, but it will be well worth it.\nPresidents Hayes, Eisenhower, Coolidge, and Buchanan\nTHANK YOU!\nA big thank you to everyone for their interest in my presidential sketchbook! Never did I expect to sell one copy, let alone have it go through three printings. In traveling the country I've been grateful for the opinions, insight, and humor people have shared with me in talking about one of our country's most important traditions.

I failed miserably, so I formed an alliance with my artist friend Aage and turned my efforts to what I do know - designing and programming applications.\nWe've been slowly developing the application in our free time for years, but now that Dungeon Builder is nearing its completion, we hope that you will help us find the funds needed to take time off from our day jobs, in order to finally finish our map maker.\nDungeon Builder lets anyone, regardless of their art skills, make beautiful, isometric, high resolution maps that look hand drawn.\nAdditionally, if you want to add your own drawings to your maps, all you have to do is drop your drawing and a file with a bit of extra information into Dungeon Builder's Custom folder and you're good to go.\n See it in Action\nIf you're curious, we really recommend downloading our demo and giving it a try. Even though all the features are not in yet, we think you'll be able to see just how amazing Dungeon Builder could be with just a few months of further work.\nIf you don't feel like downloading the demo, you can check out the the video below for a demonstration of Dungeon Builder.\n Project Goal\nIf you back this project, your pledge will go towards doubling the number of art assets available in Dungeon Builder (compared to the demo), as well as completing the all basic functionality in the application.\nIn terms of functionality, that covers:\nSaving and loading maps\nExporting maps as images\nText placement and editing for notes and descriptions on your maps\nChanging map size and orientation\nChanging map background textures\nAdditional selection modes for better editing\nDragging map items to re-position them\nAs for doubling the amount of art available in Dungeon Builder, here's what we intend to add:\nCaves\nCage walls & doors\nBeds and other furniture \nMore building features\nLoads of smaller items to make your dungeons look inhabited and unique\nA look at what's available in Dungeon Builder's demo\n Please note: The floor symbol below the tables in the image above is a reference to the brilliant game series The Longest Journey. To avoid any potential copyright issues, this symbol will be replaced by another similar asset as soon as possible.\n Stretch Goals\nOur vision goes far beyond the initial funding goal. We want to add much more art, make the editor even better, and add a Play mode to Dungeon Builder as well.\nTo make all that possible, we have a lot of stretch goals. For each goal met, your map maker will become even better.\nWe want you to be able to build many different looking dungeons, so when we reach our first stretch goal, we'll add an additional wall type, an additional floor type, and three new door types.\nOur current walls are cool, but wouldn't it be great if you could stack walls to create multi storey buildings? If we reach this goal, we'll add at least two wall types that can be stacked.\nWe'd love to have really cool options for water on our maps, so if we reach this goal, we'll find a way to add \"watercolour\" rivers and streams to Dungeon Builder's palette. The watercolour effect will be reminiscent of the coloured portals available in the demo.\nMaybe we're biased from playing too much Baldur's Gate, but we think it would be awesome to be able to add train tracks, mine carts and large rock faces to Dungeon Builder's art collection.\nWhen we reach this goal, we're going to have a lot of art in Dungeon Builder, so it makes a lot of sense to start adding features that make it easier to find exactly what you want. Adding a way to specify precisely what colour map you want is also a priority, along with adding more background textures.\nThere are certain dangers in placing all our art in its original form right there in the application folder, for everyone to view and edit. However, if we reach this goal, we'll do just that. In order to give anyone who wants to add their own art to Dungeon Builder as good a foundation as possible, we'll include all the art made for this campaign as \"mods\" instead of \"baking\" it into the application.\nDungeons are cool, but dungeons with neat entrances are even better. At this level, we'll add trees, grass, and building roofs to the art collection. \nHaving a map centrepiece, where the big boss or the amazing treasure is, sounds pretty good. So at this level, we'll add three huge \"watercolour\" set pieces, including a waterfall for use with our rivers and streams.\nWhat if we could play our games right there in the application? That would be amazing! At this level we'll add a feature to reveal areas as your players explore them. We'll also add ten adventurer tokens and ten monster tokens to the art collection, add a dice rolling function, and allow the game master to hide certain map notes while printing or playing.\nIf we make it to this level, we'll implement some kind of \"fog of war\" feature, so only revealed tiles within your adventurer tokens' range of view is visible during Play mode. We'll also add 20 more monster tokens and make token movement more fluent by adding a sliding animation.\nAt this level, the simple adventurer and monster tokens are replaced by actual drawings. Do you prefer tokens? We'll find a way to add a configurable token that can be used with your own images. Finally, we'll add multi screen support, so players see a completely different screen than the DM. This will effectively allow the DM to change the map mid-game.\nFor those groups that can't meet in person to play, we really want to add a network multiplayer mode, enabling all the unlocked Play Mode features to be used over the internet.\nYou spoke and we listened: if we reach 750.000 DKK, we'll add a feature to export your maps to a Top Down View, allowing you to print battle ready top down maps for use with miniatures or tokens. Please note that this stretch goal was added after delivery was estimated, so to ensure that we do not delay the entire project if we reach this goal, work on the top down view will not start until we have delivered everything else from the Kickstarter campaign. If unlocked, the Top Down View feature will be added gradually during the two to three months after the release of version 1.0.\nProject Rewards\nCredit\nWe like to give credit where it's due, so if you help us in any way, we'd like to include you in our application credits. If you're the Batman of Kickstarter and would prefer to remain anonymous, you can opt to have an alias listed instead of your full name (or to not be listed at all).\nDungeon Builder\nAll pledge levels apart from \"A helping hand\" include Dungeon Builder, available from our website in May 2017. Dungeon Builder will include everything described in the Project Goal section above, and for every stretch goal we reach, Dungeon Builder will be improved for everyone.\nBeta Access\nCan't wait to start building Dungeons? All pledges from the Beta Builder level and up includes Beta Access. Backers at these levels will get a login to a special page on our website where they'll be able to download the latest Dungeon Builder releases throughout the development process. \nTechnically speaking, the beta phase starts when an application is feature complete, so by that definition you'll also get Alpha Access.\nThe first build available after the demo is planned to release two weeks after the Kickstarter campaign ends.\nSpecify a Map Item\nIf you have a great idea for an art asset, and want to make sure it makes it into Dungeon Builder, the Dungeon Carpenter, Stonemason, Planner, Engineer and Architect levels are for you. At these levels you get to specify a map decoration, piece of furniture, building piece or similar. Items made in this way adds to everyone's art collection, so we'll give you credit in the item's tool tip and in the status bar when the item is selected.\nTool tip and status bar credits for backer items\n  The size of the item depends on the pledge level. To give you an idea of the item sizes, we've made a little illustration.\nAn illustration of the different sizes of map items\nCarpenter (Small): 1 tile\nStonemason (Medium): 2x2 tiles or similar\nEngineer (Large): 3x3 tiles or similar\nPlanner (Huge): 4x4 tiles or similar\nArchitect (Gigantic): 5x5 tiles or similar\nSpecify a Creature\nHeroes, villains and monsters are similar to ordinary map items, but require a lot more work and attention to detail. Therefore, the pledge amount to size ratio is a bit higher for these types of drawings. As with Map Items, the size of the item depends on the pledge level.\nGuard (Small): 1 tile\nCommander (Medium): 2x2 tiles or similar\nLady/Lord (Large): 3x3 tiles or similar\nIndie and Pro Licences\nIndie and Pro versions of Dungeon Builder are identical in to Personal versions in terms of functionality and art. But with these versions, you are allowed to use maps exported from Dungeon Builder in published (print/e-book) material, royalty and attribution free.\nMultiple Rewards\nIf you would like multiple Dungeon Builder licenses, just add the amount listed at the reward level to your pledge amount, and we'll make sure you get your extra copies on release.\nTo ensure that one rich backer doesn't completely dictate the art direction, the \"Specify-rewards\" are limited to one per person.\n About the currency...\nBecause we're based in Denmark, we have to define our goals and pledge levels in Danish krone (DKK).This can get a little bit confusing if you're not up to date on conversion rates, so to make things a little easier for you, we've included the price of things in US Dollars, Euro, and British Pounds in our stretch goals and pledge descriptions. Note that the pledge amount in dollars is automatically converted by Kickstarter (and is therefore not included in the descriptions like euro and pound prices are). Also note that stretch goal amounts have been rounded to the nearest hundred.\nThe converted amounts were all updated right before going live with this campaign, but please note that they may not be accurate at the end of the campaign.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs visible from our demo, the core of Dungeon Builder is already implemented, so the risk of the project failing altogether is virtually non-existent - as long as none of us get hit by a bus, that is. Having a team of two, makes the project vulnerable to unexpected deaths. \n\nAnother risk is missing the deadline. As any developer will tell you, estimating a programming task is difficult, so after estimating the programming completion date (including all stretch goals), we've added two months for pledge extras and stretch goal art, just to be sure we're not underestimating.\n\nHowever, if we reach many of our ambitious stretch goals and then run into unexpected and very time consuming challenges e.g. with networking, there is risk that everything will not be finished by the end of May 2017. In that case, we'll give all backers beta access from the 1st of June until the beta closes and we release Dungeon Builder version 1.0.\n\nFinally, if we reach all art related stretch goals and have a lot of Specify-rewards to fulfil, there is a risk that the art side of the project will not be completely done by the end of May 2017. Should this be the case, Dungeon Builder will release as scheduled, and the remaining art will be included in updates as soon as it is ready.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge DKK 25 or more", "title": "A Helping Hand (\u20ac3 / \u00a33)", "descp": "Our thanks for helping Dungeon Builder become a reality.

Technology was developed to the point of perfection, wars were won in days and fought with squadrons of giant, piloted mechs. Nations grew greedy, their thirst for land and power was never quenched and almost all of Earth's resources were diminished.\nAfter generations of war, desperate for a resolve and each side too arrogant for a peace treaty, they began to research a type of weapon that no amount of armour or firepower could save the fragile human body from. Wave after wave of biological weapons were released - thousands of species extinct, the air left un-breathable, cities vacant and what was left of humanity had to live underground in bunkers. Any trace of government slowly dissolved, morals tossed aside for resources, land and weaponry.\nMany factions spawned as a result, humanity divided yet all living for the same purpose - to survive. Stuck in a perpetual war, will mankind exterminate themselves or find peace? You decide.\n              Collect parts and weapons to outfit your own giant mech. Once you've crafted your own custom masterpiece, test out its mettle by dropping into one of the many dangerous conflict zones in the Antraxx world. It is here where you will get to test your might against other pilots. Acquire your own land in one of the many wastelands of the world in order to grow your own faction and cement your power. Special additions such as jetpacks, rocket launchers, lasers, teleportation, and cloaking devices allow for you to select your own unique playing style.\nThere is the opportunity for endless creativity with our map creation tools. Join in-game player-hosted public events, giveaways, and battles. As a massively multiplayer game, you\u2019ll get to fight against hordes of other players.\nCharge and fire your lasers for a big impact, fire cluster missiles from great distances, or get up close and personal with a heavy machine gun. You can choose whether you want to casually meet others in the world of Antraxx and show off your mech, or wage war and conquer lands with a team. There are countless ways to achieve peace in the never ending war known as Antraxx.\nTEAMWORK\nThere is a heavy emphasis on cooperative gameplay between your faction members and allies. No matter how powerful, one lone mech cannot withstand the might of an entire army. There is strength to be found in numbers. Join an existing faction, or if you wish you can even start your own and build a loyal following of friends and comrades-in-arms.\nSilver tongue? Every pilot has the opportunity to use the chaotic politics and economy of the world to their advantage and earn riches, power, land, and mechs through diplomacy alone. Will you take down empires with persuasion alone? Remember though, the taller they are, the harder they fall.\nARCADE-ESQUE\nWith tight, responsive controls, you can pilot your own giant mech to either aid or destroy your fellow pilots. Establish dominance by destroying all of the gun turrets and beacons on the field. When you have done so, the map will start a reinforcement timer to allow for the enemy team to defend their map and re-establish their rule.Inspired by classic arcade games, each battle is full of high adrenaline and explosive action.\nPlayers will fight for the control of special power-up points on the map which will allow them to restore energy, health, or even grant them special powers such as invisibility. Each map has its own individual mechanics which must be learned and mastered in order to provide a fresh but familiar experience every time. Individual maps will have different player limits, so choose your team wisely.\nAntraxx will immerse you in a detailed, 1980's themed post-apocalyptic world. It is up to you to dominate the battlefields with only your guns and armored mech to your name.\nSOVEREIGNTY\nEstablish dominance by destroying all of the gun turrets and beacons on the field. When you have done so, the map will start a reinforcement timer to allow for the enemy team to defend their map and re-establish their rule. After the timer lapses and the enemy team is unable to defend themselves, you\u2019ll have conquered the map and claimed sovereignty. Upon conquering the map, you can completely customize the turrets using a feature similar to the mechbay (details below). We will only allow limited re-positioning of turrets on the conquerable zones to prevent abuse.\n        No one mech is alike. You are able to choose various individual parts from multiple default mech builds and combine them into an unstoppable force. Trade resources and your own mechs parts in favour of others, or blow them off of another mech and steal them. The choice is yours.\nCUSTOMIZATION\nIn Antraxx you can collect mech parts and weapons to outfit your own individual mech. The character is fully customisable from legs, left and right arms, to cockpit and shoulder rocket packs. After selecting the desired parts, you can even choose colours for each individual part. In the game itself, you can find mech parts laying around from dead mechs in the map. You can also purchase them from the in-game store with your experience points, or you can trade with players. We are even allowing users to come to a battle agreement with a specific mech part as a reward!\nAntraxx offers many different colours and skins for mech parts, as well as supporting . Each piece such as shoulders, cockpit, legs and weapons will individually fit onto your mech in any combination you like.\nAnd, to make things more interesting, there will be special faction mech models that have a different print.\nCHARACTER DEVELOPMENT\nThere are a lot of interesting gameplay mechanics. As for your mech character, you are dealing with damage, armour, speed and energy. For instance:\nENERGY\nOur game features powerful laser weapons and teleportation that requires the use of energy. Some use and require more energy than others.\nDAMAGE\nYou will receive damage when shot. The amount of damage depends on your armor stats and the strength of the opponent\u2019s weapon. If parts of your mech body become too damaged, they will explode and become malfunctioned. If a part malfunctions, you will not be able to use it anymore. This also means that if one of your guns is destroyed, you will deal less damage. The same goes for all other parts. If your legs are destroyed, you will not be able to walk. If your torso malfunctions, you can no longer rotate your upper body.\nSPEED\nThe more you fit on your mech, the slower you become. It is also dependent on the attributes of your parts. The above mechanics are boosted by your character's attributes. When you level up, your attributes gain points and your parts will increase points proportionately according to those attributes. You could potentially become faster, have more hit-points, or use less energy. We are still debating if we should develop the characters by restricting certain parts before you reach a certain level. For instance, not having shoulder parts would mean not being able to fly until you level up, or you could start with only two out of the four guns.\n          FACTIONS \n  We have spent so much time creating countless art assets and tools to assist us in development. We feel it would be a waste to not open it up to you. Using our editor, players can create maps and host their own games, events, and social meetups within them. The \u201cBATTLE\u201d mode allows for users to join other user hosted games. Battle mode will offer different game types compared to anywhere else in the world map, such as: free for all, team death-match, king of the hill and more. We aim to create various map construction kits to support multiples themes such as city, desert, space and more all containing over 2500 combinations of tiles/entities.  \n     We also have an in-game \u201cwired entity\u201d system, that allows you to place and use contraptions that involve things such as buttons, elevators, shield walls, cables and more. Of course a game wouldn\u2019t be complete without pickups and boosters which you will grow to rely on. These tiles randomly spawn boosters that will restore your mech to full energy, health, or activate a shield that will stay active until it breaks due to damage.\n        To get the merchandise pledge any of the 'MECH MODEL' tiers OR add 100 euros (110 dollars) to your pledge.\nWe create a high-poly, detailed model of the mech to print out with each mech piece split up and printable by itself (shoulders, cockpit, legs, weapons etc). We have attachments that can be fitted together to create a full mech from various pieces, meaning you can customise the printed models almost as much as you can in-game - with the added benefit of being able to paint it yourself if you choose to.  \n      Twitter & retweet this pinned post \nFacebook & share our pinned post\nYouTube\n  We have been developing Antraxx for over 5 years now\u2014at least since the initial concepts. When we first began we were far too naive (and ambitious) to achieve what we wanted to achieve. We have spent a lot of money over the years on art assets, server hosting and feeding ourselves all from our savings - but we can\u2019t continue that way. We\u2019ve built up a great fanbase, a loyal following and we know this is a game that people want.\nTo fully realise this dream we need financial support. We\u2019ve had talks with multiple publishers, but we don\u2019t really want to go down that route. We want this project to be an ever evolving world. Antraxx is not just one game, its a universe, a franchise and hopefully a legacy.\nSPECIAL THANKS TO\nWhile working on Antraxx we've had the chance to meet a lot of amazing people on our way to work with, and would like to take this opportunity to introduce them to you.\nINDIGO 2016 - Antraxx premiered at INDIGO, the showcase for the finest, most outstanding games by independent developers. The games range from brand new playable prototypes to completed games offering impressive and rich experiences. We took this experience to gather feedback and to stress test the client and server.\n  Kongregate is a great webbrowser gaming website that is part of the gamestop network. Kong is supporting us by giving away Kong+ to backers of Antraxx with a special pledge pack of \u20ac40,-. The original value of Kong+ alone is $29.99 A YEAR!\nKong Plus gets you more out of your Kongregate experience. Take advantage of ad-free gaming, cool profile skins, automatic beta access, and private chat with Kong Plus. Learn more on the Kongregate website\nAlthough we are currently not working together with MANA on the marketing for Antraxx and the promotion of our Kickstarter campaign we would like to thank Mana Marketing for a huge role in building our player base and getting the word out. We wouldn't have been able to be where we are today without them. A true recommendation to other indie game developers also. Check them out here.\n        DEVELOPMENT\nWe began prototyping Antraxx a few years ago under the old name \u201cMETA4\u201d, that had to change due to legal reasons. We initially used Actionscript with FlashDevelop in a custom 2D engine that ran on mobile devices, the web and desktop using Adobe Air. This worked well for our initial prototype and it helped us see many flaws in the game. \nLast year we decided to re-write the game and redo some of the initial concepts, no more point and click and more action. We are now utilising some of the latest technologies, such as WebGL and ES6. The engine is written to be scalable, networked and run on many platforms from the ground up. So far we support: Web, Windows, Mac, Linux and Android devices (tablets/mobiles) running Chrome. A mobile/tablet version of the game has been one of our goals since the project\u2019s inception. With your help we may be able to achieve this through stretch goals. It will require a lot more time and testing on physical devices, therefore more money but the technology is there already.\n    The game engine can be ran headless as a server or graphically as a client, which supports a full 3d environment (we use sprites and clever uv mapping tricks to achieve the isometric pixel art style), positional audio, lighting, dynamic shadows and much more that you\u2019d expect to find in modern games - all running in the browser. Antraxx runs entirely on custom proprietary software with support from libraries such as socket.io and THREE.js, there is no game engine such as Unity used.\nWe tweet more than daily @AntraxxGame - follow us to keep up with our development.\n    You may be wondering why it takes so much time and costs so much to create a mech, well let's break it down. A mech is composed of 8 individual components which have to be drawn separately in 16 angles (besides the legs which use 8, however their animation is the most complex). We need to ensure that each of these components is able to fit onto other mech models and still look good. Once the initial angles are drawn, certain pieces need animating. Let's count the frames:\n- Legs: 8 angles, 10 frames of animation = 80\n- Cockpit: 16 angles, 2 frames of animation = 32\n- Shoulder: 16 angles, 2 frames of animation = 32\n- Weapon (left): 16 angles, 6 frames of animation = 96\n- Weapon (right): 16 angles, 6 frames of animation = 96\n- Side weapon (left): 16 angles, 6 frames of animation = 96\n- Side weapon (right): 16 angles, 6 frames of animation = 96\nTotal: 528 individual frames per mech\n    GLOBAL BUDGET BREAKDOWN\nOf the aimed 30,000 euros (roughly 33,000 dollars), we will dedicate 29% to both artwork and continued development of the game, as well as initial server upkeep at launch. From our projected estimates we will be spending around 400 euros a month initially to run two regions of game servers (Europe and US). If we go over our goal we will be able to allot more funds to the servers which opens up more regions (such as Asia, Africa). The game engine has already been developed to a point where it is ready to fully flesh out the game world.\nIf we reach our stretch goals we can get friends who are very good pixel artists to help rapidly create art pieces that we can plug into the game. This includes but is not limited to: map construction kits, mech pieces, promotional artwork and in-game ui. Most of our rewards are digital or physical art pieces, which is why it is included in this tier. Our physical mech model is also included in this cut, we have a deal arranged with the manufacturer to produce as many as we require after Kickstarter is completed at a low rate due to the 3D model and prototype already being completed several months ago.\nYou may be wondering, why are we only aiming for 30k as an initial goal? Well, we have already invested over 35,000 euros into the project (near $40,000) over the course of development, with costs ranging from artwork to promotional material and server upkeep. Unfortunately, we have spent what we can afford to spend on the game without your support to help get it to completion.\nKickstarter and taxes take quite a large chunk, about 31% in total which leaves only 11% to audio for sound effects and music. We already have a large collection of in-game SFX, and we plan to produce a Noisia-ish style with heavy drum and bass influences combined with the old original starcraft OST. Leendert has 10 years experience in audio production, he has spent the majority of his time managing artists, producing art and promoting the game - but with your funding he cant wait to get his hands on more of the audio aspects of Antraxx and produce a full OST.\naccording to google on 3 October 2016\n MISC \n        ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDeveloping any type of game is a huge undertaking and challenge, especially a multiplayer one. However, with over 10 years experience in programming, game development and networking, the technical issues, for the most part, have been overcome. We have had a demo available online on the browser which was connected to our server, providing a constant online world for a few months. It had a few issues to begin with but were smoothly ironed out and many optimizations were possible thanks to our dedicated fanbase that help us with testing and load balancing. So far we\u2019ve had over 1,500 individual players in the game and hope for many more as the game progresses. We\u2019ve had overwhelmingly positive feedback on how the game performs, how it plays and how it looks. After years of fine tuning, we finally have a solid direction.\n\nThere are still issues to face, however. The primary issue for us would be server upkeep, mainly because of the costs involved for the amount of players we want. This is one reason Kickstarter is a great idea, as it allows us to definitely have the funds there to be able to run the servers we require.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, it won\u2019t be an easy road to balance the game and ensure its compelling and accessible to new and experienced players alike. This is something that only comes with extensive testing and user feedback. As our fans know, we frequent on our social channels requesting feedback and working with players to implement the ideas that they have or to resolve issues. To help solve this issue, we will run in early access for a few months before the game\u2019s launch to perfect gameplay as much as possible.\n\nRegardless of issues we will face, here is what we can promise:\nWe engage directly with the community and listen to feedback, and will continue to do so while we develop this game and maintain it. This isn\u2019t a game where we release it and then never touch it again\u2014we want it to be an ever evolving universe.\nWe'll have full transparency in regards to the development process, delays and issues we face.\n\nWe\u2019ve come this far. Now we just need your help to fully realise our's (and many of our fans') dream game.

GURPS is famous for letting you play any character you can imagine. Dungeon Fantasy keeps this flexibility while trimming away unnecessary details, concentrating on just what matters to monster-slaying, treasure-hunting action: Pick from 11 classic professions and nine playable races, customize your alter-ego using quick-start templates and a powerful point-build system, and gear up with an equipment list that offers dozens of weapons and lets you assemble exactly the suit of armor that fits your image.\nExploits (112 pages). Learn how the heroes actually use their abilities and gear. That means combat, of course \u2013 and dozens of other activities, whether your thing is sneaking around, swinging from the scenery, exorcizing evil, or getting rich through cunning deals in town. This book also describes countless bad things that can befall adventurers (poison, traps, dismemberment, lava pits . . .), as well as good things, namely loot. And it\u2019s full of practical advice to the Game Master who leads this three-ring circus: challenging the players, keeping the action moving, settling arguments, and much more.\nSpells (80 pages). What would fantasy be without magic? Adventurers features four spellcasting professions (bard, cleric, druid, and wizard), and this volume describes over 400 spells to help you customize them. It also includes complete rules for how spells work \u2013 whether their power comes from the gods, Nature, or creepy tomes of forbidden wizardly knowledge.\nMonsters (64 pages). Once the adventurers are ready, and armed with weapons and magic, it\u2019s time to test their mettle! This catalog starts you out with more than 80 things that want to bite, claw, grab, sting, and curse the heroes \u2013 not just the predictable orcs and zombies, but also several Dungeon Fantasy originals. Each offers notes on tactics and variants, and the whole collection comes with advice and rules for adventurers dealing with monsters . . . and monsters dealing with adventurers.\nDungeon (24 pages). I Smell a Rat is a simple (but not simplistic!) quest designed to show new gamers the ropes. Like any classic hack \u2018n\u2019 slash adventure, it starts at the inn. From there, the heroes will find themselves facing traps, enemies, and unexpected twists \u2013 and finding treasure, although not necessarily gold and silver. Advice and \u201cadventure hooks\u201d let the Game Master challenge advanced players or spin the tale into a series of adventures.\nWhile based on the GURPS Basic Set and its GURPS Dungeon Fantasy and GURPS Magic supplements, this is a standalone roleplaying game, ready to play out of the box! It\u2019s compatible with GURPS, but the famously detailed rules have been streamlined to be friendlier to new gamers and veterans alike. For existing GURPS fans, revisions made in response to nearly 10 years of customer feedback on the GURPS Dungeon Fantasy series \u2013 along with completely new content unique to this set \u2013 make this a \u201cmust have.\u201d\nCheck out these stretch goals!\nIMPORTANT NOTE: All stretch goals listed below are only eligible to backers pledging $50 or more.

We are offering all of these existing PDFs as add-ons.

A story about the value of science & skepticism, and their conflict with religion and narrative-based thinking. After the Gold Rush is a return to optimistic Science Fiction - the idea that the world can be better. \nThis Kickstarter aims to print the second chapter in the saga. Each issue is 22 pages long, with extra features such as web comic pages, a scientist of the issue section, write-in science corrections, etc. \nWe ran a Kickstarter last year to start After the Gold Rush, and thanks to all of our awesome backers we have enough to keep the story going for 4 issues! However, the plan was to keep them digital. Due to popular demand we are planning to print them now. And that is why we are back on Kickstarter. \nSee the cover for ATGR #2 close up.\n    This image will also be the logo on the T-Shirts!\nIt is good to have warnings, but it is better to have goals. Science Fiction is full of important stories warning us about the dangers of our hubris. That is a useful lesson, but it shouldn't be all we use the genre for. I grew up watching Star Trek, a show about exploration, progress, and ethics. While it didn't always nail the details, it cared about science and reason. After the Gold Rush is my small attempt to return some of those ideas to modern Science-Fiction.\n   This comic is also about the value of skepticism, and explaining what that means. Too often skeptics are synonymous with cynics. I want to show what skepticism is really about - caring about what's true. \nIf you want to know more, check out the episode of Skeptics Guide to the Universe I was on. I go over my aspirations for the book in more depth. \n  Isaac La Russa & Miles Greb\nMiles Greb - Creator & Writer - Former Bob Dylan impersonator whose obsession with Star Trek is annoying to everyone.\nIsaac La Russa - Lead Artist & Concept Artist -Based in Illinois, he wears motley flannels and owns two ungrateful cats.\nAdrian Geller - Colorist - Like Mario Paint for the SNES, but with nearly twice the personality\nAndrew Pierce - Editor - Lovable goof. Escaped Kipling protagonist.\nJamie Me - Lettering - Letterer who spends his time wearing pajamas called a 'gi' while learning the art of Brazilian jiu-jitsu.\nBarry Blankenship -Cover Artist & Logo Design - Amateur cursing cat ventriloquist.\nLauren Uhde - Science Adviser - PhD student and all-around Biology Babe.\nBen Rodgers - Assistant Editor - Historian of historical biographies, at least he was historically. \n Poster Team - David Hovey ,Natasha Alterici, Chris Lewis Lee. \n You can follow the project closer at - @Goldrushcomic. \n Some of the characters and technology you will find in After the Gold Rush.

But first, I wanted you to take a moment and check out this amazing work by Milsae Kim.\n This print will be available as an 11\" X 17\", but it will also be part of a limited run of variant covers for After the Gold Rush #2. There will only be 100 printed. This is your best chance to get one. They will all be signed by Miles Greb.\nIf you didn't get a printed copy of #1 yet...\nIn case you missed out last time. :)\n New Reward! 48 hours special, a one of a kind sketch cover. \nThis reward, the Luna Level, features this one of a kind cover, the variant cover, and a signed copy of ATGR #1. \nThe Reward Levels\nA Look at the Art Pints\nAll the prints are 11\" x 17\" except for \"Inspire Science\", that is 8 1/2\"x11\". They are all printed on a high quality glossy card stock, and look great. If you back at a reward level with a large art print, you may choose whatever one you fancy. Here are your options. \nShirts\nThey are print on demand, so sizes S to XL are available!!\nBy popular demand we have included After the Gold Rush T-shirts as reward options! Wear this to show your science-loving comic support around town, and wherever cool comic-people hangout. The T-shirts are print on demand, so sizes should not be an issue. I think they look pretty cool. \nCustom Profile Art, by Isaac La Russa\nWant to see yourself in a Cyro suit or a Titan Explorer uniform? There are reward tiers with both a full body commission like the one you see below. or, you can get a profile done that is perfect to use for facebook or twitter. The art will be delivered to you digitally.\nA Comission we did last time. The Cyro Suit.\nFull body art commissions by Aimee Zhou\nWe also have the amazing storyboard artist Aimee Zhou on staff. The $125 dollar reward level includes a hand drawn commission of you in a Titan Explorer or Cyro suit! And the original art will be delivered to you! Pretty cool. \nAimee will draw you in a ATGR suit, and you get the actual copy!\n Stretch Goals\nIf things go really well I would love to be able to continue the ATGR webcomic. It precedes the events of ATGR, and follows Scout as a young girl growing up on Titan. You can check it out here for FREE.\n    As some of you know, we ran a Kickstarter last summer to get the whole story started. Thanks to everyone's support we have the funds needed to finish all the art for ATGR #2. We had planned to release it digitally only, not printed. \n    However, demand for a printed copy has been really high, so here is your chance to make it a reality. Most of the budget will go directly into Printing Costs and Shipping. Another small chunk will go into art fees for commissions done especially for this Kickstarter - the variant cover and some new art commissions. Lastly, fees from Kickstarter, taxes, stuff like that.\n  This graphic shows the normal cost for an issue, it's different for this Kickstarter however. But, it gives you a good idea of the costs\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAside from any tragedies among the creative team or when shipping the freight, I feel confident everything will work out. \nThis is my second comic book campaign, and the first one went well.

Whether you pledged on day one or you pledge on the last day you will receive these! If you are getting 3 full games, you also get 3 sets of stretch goal rewards!\n*the only tier not eligible for stretch goal rewards is the first ($16) tier, which was created exclusively for the purpose of reducing shipping cost to international backers.\nOrganATTACK! brings to life medical and pseudoscientific concepts in a twisted, hilarious, very fun, and surprisingly educational card game for anyone who owns organs.*\n\nDeveloped, designed and illustrated by The Awkward Yeti, creator of four successful Kickstarter campaigns,* including this one to make Heart and Brain plush toys. Awkward Yeti comics reach millions each month on the web, including a portion of 1.2 million Facebook fans. (*100% of The Awkward Yeti's campaigns have reached or exceeded their goals!)\nA beta test was held with about 30 participants to help refine the game\n  Gallbladder's Last Day\nThe Awkward Yeti is the New York Times best selling cartoonist behind Heart and Brain, as well as the cartoonist behind Lars on LINE Webtoon, Medical Tales Retold on Tapastic, and a variety of viral comics. A great deal of care was applied to the development of the game over the past year - making sure there was a good balance between randomness and strategy, that the medical themes are often informative but requires absolutely no medical understanding, and that the representations of characters were true to the comics.\nI've been wanting to make a board game for much longer than that, but could never quite figure out the details. With card games seemingly making a comeback (or at least with me becoming aware of this comeback last year) I started thinking of ways I could simplify my mindset. One day I went for a run, accidentally forgetting my headphones at home, forcing me to use my brain for entertainment. That's when I came up with the initial concept for the card game in its entirety. All during one run. Since then of course I spent countless hours developing and re-developing that concept, and that's where we are now...\nAbout the Game\nThe object of the game is to remove your opponents' organs using corresponding afflictions before they remove yours. The last person to still have at least one organ is the winner.\nIn addition to Affliction cards (like Pancreatitis, which can be played on either Gallbladder or Pancreas), the game has instant defensive cards, and lots of crazy tactical moves that shake things up. What you end up with is a pretty fast-paced, very fun, and often intense gameplay that's suitable for all levels of players.\nThe game is best enjoyed by 2-5 players.\n\nORGAN DECK (20 cards):\nThere are 19 organs in the deck, plus one Organ WILD card. The 19 organs were chosen based on the most used Awkward Yeti characters, and include most of the major organs like Heart and Brain, as well as fan favorites like Tongue and Teeth. \nOrgans require 2 afflictions for removal and the Organ WILD requires 4 afflictions for removal (however, it is susceptible to any affliction card)\nATTACK DECK (72 cards):\nAfflictions: It takes two corresponding afflictions to remove an opponent's organ. Afflictions match up with one or more organs and can only be played on that organ (unless you play it along with Metastasis, which turns an Affliction into a Wild)\nWilds: Wilds can be played as one affliction on any organ, except for Necrosis Wild cards, which instantly remove an organ\nResistance: Defensive cards that resist attacks or instantly block attacks\nTactical and Bureaucracy: These cards shake the game up in a variety of ways. For example, \"Kidnapped\" allows you to take an opponent's organ for yourself. \"Sedate\" skips an opponent for two turns, etc\nPoisoned: As soon as the card is drawn, the player must remove one of his/her own organs.\nThe two decks will be packaged side by side in a nice box along with the rule book (I will update as I have more specific info/design available)\nHyperthyroidism\nAbout the Kickstarter\nSome specifics are subject to change\nThe Awkward Yeti has successfully completed multiple Kickstarter campaigns to raise money for new projects, including this campaign for Heart and Brain plush toys. Without these campaigns, major product launches simply would not be possible. It's one of the best ways to show support for a webcomic cartoonist!\nThe game has been in development for about a year and has been through multiple revisions and a full beta test, so it should be ready for production within a few weeks of the Kickstarter's end (pending any improvements).\nThe goal was set to be the minimum amount I believe will be needed for production of the game, shipping to backers, and Kickstarter and credit card fees. I am prepared to cover additional fees myself if necessary. Of course, there's great hope that it will go well beyond the goal!\nNote: Backers are charged AFTER the Kickstarter ends, ONLY IF the original goal is met.\nThe game should be produced and shipped out to backers before the winter holidays, so keep it in mind as a gift!\nSHIPPING RATES: These have been calculated based on the lowest USPS rates available to us after their recent price increases. These were calculated based on estimated weights, which will exceed the low weight threshold of 13oz. Higher tiers have been given discounted shipping due to the amount pledged.\nGoals:\nThe more money we raise, the lower the price per game will be, and that means room for bonuses! Here's what Kickstarter backers can expect at each level (goals in color have been reached):\n  We hit the goal in less than an hour! WOW!\n  Enjoy your stickers!\n  ooh la la, these games will look nice!\n  The gift will be a set of customized Poker cards! All backers at a $20 tier or higher will receive this at no extra charge!

My story is about Scout, a family dog who gets lost in the woods, runs into a lonesome bigfoot, and how they work together to survive all kinds of deadly hazards and emotional peril. The comic was just an experiment at first, but it caught on, and people liked it. And I\u2019ve never had more fun working on anything.\nWho's it for?\nUntold Tales of Bigfoot is great for comic fans of any age. There's no swearing, no nudity \u2013 just good clean fun, adventure, a little mystery and a lot of heart.\nWhat are we all doing here?\nIf we reach our goal, this Kickstarter will get Untold Tales of Bigfoot into print and into your hands.\nWhat else can I get?\nBesides the book (printed & pdf versions) we'll have digital wallpaper, bookmarks, stickers, button sets, one-of-a-kind commissioned artwork \u2013 even some fun options for putting you right there in the woods with Bigfoot and Scout!\nReward Tiers\nIf you just want the book, you can get just the book. But If you want to stack custom art and other fun rewards on top of that, I've got you covered. Here's a quick breakdown:\nSometimes it's easier to visualize what you're getting with actual images. So here are some featured reward tiers.\nThe Scout Tier ($26) is your basic, printed book tier. You get the book, the bookmark, and the digital assets.\nThe Sleeping Bears Two-Pack ($46) is for anyone who needs a second book for collecting, or gift-giving, or whatever.\n The Naturalist Tier ($55) is a great value that offers a lotta' bang for your buck and includes a custom cartoon illustration of you deep in the woods with Bigfoot and Scout.(NOTE: If you're caricature-shy, you could have your friend, spouse or child take your place in the woods next to Bigfoot. No problem! And a great gift idea!)\nThe Cave Drawings Tier ($100) Gives you everything from The Naturalist Tier PLUS you can get me to draw any single character you want (no nudity) and I'll hand ink it, color it with grey marker, sign it and ship it out with your book. Imagine the possibilities!\nThe Sweet Baby Corn Tier ($350, limited to 4 people) puts you right in the action as a character in a 6-page Untold Tales of Bigfoot short that'll run online. You'll also get a special Kickstarter Edition Comic Book of the printed story.\nStretch Goals!\n$9,000 Book Upgrade! If we reach $9,000, everybody who bought a physical copy of the book gets an upgrade to a more elaborate, deluxe version of the book! That includes a more substantial cover, an introduction by award-winning author Matthew Cody (whose books are fantastic fun for middle-grade to adult readers -- check 'em out), and an afterword by me discussing the origins of this comic.\n$10,000 Patch! If we reach $10,000, everybody who bought a physical copy of the book gets a 3-inch, fully-embroidered Friend of Bigfoot Patch to show the world that you and Bigfoot are good buddies!\n Want to add an extra copy of the book?\nI've had a few requests about add-ons from folks who'd like a second copy of the book for collecting, gift-giving and even donating to their school library (way to go!). Kickstarter doesn't make it easy, but the prevailing method seems to be clicking the \u201cManage\u201d button and adding the price of a book to your pledge. In this case, if you've pledged to get a physical book already ($24 and above), an extra, signed copy of Untold Tales of Bigfoot is just another $20. Here's how to do it:\nI ask you to remind me twice that you added an extra book because I want to make sure I get your order correct. I'm nutty that way.\nNote to International Buyers: Adding one (1) extra copy of the book to your bundle ($24 or higher) won't raise your shipping, thank goodness. Message me if you'll need more than one extra. Also, I know the international shipping rates are high and there's not much I can do about that. But, to try to ease the pain just a little, any international backers who pledge for a physical copy of the book get this free sticker.\nWhat's this now? Samples and blurbs?\nI didn't want to give too much of the story away to those who aren't familiar with it, but here are some sample pages from the book and some very nice things a few very talented folks had to say about Untold Tales of Bigfoot.\n        Where's all the money going?\nMost of the funds contributed go toward printing the book, having it shipped to me, and then mailing it out to you. Another smaller percentage goes toward art and shipping supplies, and some of the smaller rewards. The final chunk of change is handed over to Kickstarter/Stripe for their fees.\nAnd I'll be using PrintNinja for the books because they've done a fantastic job with many of the Kickstarter Graphic Novels I've backed.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBook One is done. Art and story. So that's a load off. But, having backed a few Kickstarters myself, I'm aware that even with great preparation, sometimes a monkey-wrench is tossed into the gears (production issues, illness, backers dropping out, etc.). But if we get the books shipped to us in a timely manner, I'll begin signing/sketching in them as soon as they're in hand. And I hope to start any commissioned pieces as soon as I can collect the information from the buyers. That, too, takes time but literally all I do all day is draw, so I'm used to that. So it's really just a matter of getting the art done and sending it out. And, while all these variables prevent me from pinning down an exact date, overall, I feel confident that, as long as we get the money to print this book, I can fulfill the rewards as promised in a timely manner. \n\nFor those who choose \u201cThe Naturalist\u201d tier, I'll send out your physical rewards as soon as I'm done signing/drawing in your books. The digital file of you with Bigfoot & Scout will be finished as soon as possible and emailed separately.\n\nIf anyone chooses the \u201cSweet Baby Corn\u201d reward tier, they'll receive the bulk of their rewards as soon as I'm done signing/drawing in the books. The digital file of you with Bigfoot & Scout will take some time and will be emailed separately. But the 6-page short will take longer. I'll be drawing that and posting it as quickly as I can, but that'll take longer to accomplish than the single Bigfoot/Scout image. The story is outlined, but receiving your photos, doing character studies, and drawing your characters in multiple panels will take a while. I don't have an exact date set for when the 6-pager will post, but I'll send out updates along the way to keep you apprised and after it's had it's run online I will have the pages printed and bound and ship that special Kickstarter Edition comic to you separately.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #34", "update_userinfo": "Untold Tales of Bigfoot Nominated for another Reuben", "update_content": "Apologies to anyone who\u2019s had to hear this news a dozen times so far this year, but I just realized I hadn\u2019t posted it here, in Kickstarter, where some of my biggest supporters connect with me.\nIt might seem like deja vu from a year ago, but Untold Tales of Bigfoot was once again nominated for a Reuben from the National Cartoonists Society in the category of Online Comics - Longform.

Now you can get extra rewards just for being a generous fan of quality comics.\n I've been involved in the roleplaying game industry for most of my career. I run my own freelance illustration company, James Stowe Illustration. Four years ago I started an online comic project called Sidekick Quests that combined my experience with roleplaying games with my love of illustration in a project that I could share with my kids and ideally other geeky parents could share with their kids.\nInitially I created a simplified version of 4th Ed. DnD for my then 6 year old son\u2019s birthday party. I had been toying around with some long form comic ideas and once people really started responding to the work I did for that party I decided to expand upon it.\nAnd now here we are. I really want Sidekick Quests to be a living roleplaying game. I find the idea of a comic that can be played as an ever changing and expanding roleplaying game setting is something I\u2019ve always wanted to play. And if it is also a way to introduce a new generation to tabletop RPGs, all the better. It was from the ideas and solutions I worked into those initial sheets that I developed Sidekick Quests, both as a comic and as a stand alone roleplaying game for kids. Two of the characters from the sheets (the ranger and the bard, see above) actually converted directly into characters in the comic (those being Benton the Scout and Dalea the Amateur Minstrel respectively. I have always enjoyed world building, so taking those sheets and creating an entire world around them was one of my favorite parts of the process. I have pages and pages of notes and thumbnail sketches about the World of Adventur (the setting of Sidekick Quests) and its denizens and lore.\n  Sidekick Quests is one of the great joys of the internet. Part roleplaying game, part web comic, it's unique, and delightful. Kids and parents alike will love James Stowe's lively, wonderful creation - as my daughter and I already do.\nJohn Kovalic - innovator of fantasy roleplaying comics since 1997, creator of Dorktower and Munchkin artist extraordinaire!\n(James Stowe\u2019s) world and characters captures imaginations in young and old alike. Sidekick Quests is doing a huge part to seed the next generation of tabletop gamers with positive messages and healthy table habits that encourage inclusiveness and fair play. You cannot go wrong laying down your hard-earned dollars on this campaign.\nBrian Patterson - creator of d20Monkey  \n(Sidekick Quests the Roleplaying Game) feels like the best game of DND you played as a twelve year old indoor kid, in all the best ways.\nChris O\u2019Neil - Kobolds Ate My Baby and 9th Level Games  \nSidekick Quests is engaging, dynamic, and everything that a kid's RPG should be. It's got old-school charm, indie sensibilities, and is just plain fun.\nTracy Barnett - Exploding Rogue Studios\nJames took what could've been a one-off internet meme and turned it into an earnest love letter to fantasy adventure.\nDaniel Solis - Creator of more fantastic indy tabletop games than you can shake a Kodama branch at.\n     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is James Stowe's very first Kickstarter. While the updated comic and script for the adventure are complete the 10 bonus pages, art prints, and maps still need to be created and the adventure copy needs to be edited and laid out.Every publishing project carries risks. Sidekick Quests is created, illustrated, written, game developed and directed by one guy, James Stowe (with some amazing assistance from his editor/internet guru Anna Izenman and writing/playtesting help from his family) If James were to be struck my lightning or choke on a ham sandwich, it would have a big impact on the completion of this project than a larger company might see.

Plus you'll receive the DRM-free PDF copy and digital comics bundle!\n   My name is Josh Trujillo and I am a writer based in Los Angeles. Comic books are a lifelong passion of mine, and I have spent many years learning to navigate the industry. This has meant internships at publishers including Dark Horse, and Archaia, visiting conventions all over the United States, and trying to hone my skills as a creator.\nIn the past few years I have taken it more seriously, getting work published in anthologies like ANYTHING THAT LOVES, UNLAWFUL GOOD, and having short stories featured in books like THE REASON FOR DRAGONS. In addition, I self-publish my own comics and last year launched the fantasy gaming anthology, DEATH SAVES! Next month ADVENTURE TIME: THE FOUR CASTLES, an original graphic novel I wrote for BOOM! Studios, debuts. I'm very excited about it!!\nLOVE MACHINES has been my main project during this whole time. I'm a bit of a romantic at heart, and put way too much thought into the way that we interact with technology of all sorts. Publishing, and trying to market these technological romance comics has not been an easy task. Action is what most often sells in mainstream comics, not heart. Having said that, it has been a hugely rewarding experience taking my comics on tour, interacting with fans and my fellow creators, and trying to find a place for it in the complicated comics cosmology.\nWhile there are a few other romance titles out there, nobody is doing quite what I am. It is my hope that, like with DEATH SAVES last year, LOVE MACHINES is able to connect to a wider readership through this campaign. It would be a huge deal to be able to collect these stories in a more permanent format.\nIt would be humbling to fund the printing of this hardcover collection. If we're fortunate enough to achieve that goal I have some ideas on what to do next...\n$5,000 - BONUS STORY - AN ELECTRIC MOON - UNLOCKED -If we reach this total an additional 16-page story will be added, \"An Electric Moon\" by the amazing JT Cole! This tale serves as a perfect endcap for this collection, and deals with how a complicated love is threatened by the latest technological innovation -- electricity. This would bring our total page count up to 176 pages!\n$8,000 - ANOTHER BONUS STORY - RISE TO VOTE - Oh man this seems like a lot of money! But if we get there you will get a second bonus LOVE MACHINES story, \"Rise to Vote\" by SM Vidaurri. This 16-page story touches on the delicate physical (and social) machinations we use in elections. This would bring the page count up to 192 pages!\n   Most of the money will go directly to our North American printer. The remainder of the funds will allow us to fulfill our pledged Kickstarter rewards, cover miscellaneous production/promotional fees, and cushion us in case shipping costs go over (they often do!)\nThe creators of this project have already been compensated for their work, independent of whether or not we reach our fundraising goal.\nA thank you to everyone who has helped make LOVE MACHINES a reality! It is exciting to be so close to realizing my vision for the project. I never would have been able to make it this far without the support of the talented friends, family, and peers who have guided me up to this point.\nAn especially big thanks to the artists who were willing to help tell these stories. It has taken enormous commitment (and often sacrifice) on their part to make these comics happen. I only hope that this collection will properly spotlight all of the amazing talented I have had the pleasure of working with over the years.\n\"Lung\" art and colors by Patrick Horvath.\n\"Workers of All Lands, Unite!\" art by Ryo Kawakami, colors by Mike Dake, letters by Adam Pruett.\n\"Solenoids\" art by JB Wolfe.

That series is now being collected into a 104-page softcover graphic novel, but in the meantime we've got another three Semiautomagic stories we would like to include in a special, expanded edition of that graphic novel: a box set including a second, 80-page softcover of new stories.\nSemiautomagic follows the highs and lows (mostly lows) of occult investigator Alice Creed, an average girl from a bad part of town who ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time. A decade after the wrong turn that changed her life, she is who you call when magic ends up in murder. \nBut the magic of Alice's world isn't the cozy, familiar magic of Vertigo books: no myths and legends, no Bast and Queen Mab here. Just the void, and inexplicable, incomprehensible things coming through from other dimensions, other colours of space. Magic itself is a thing with barely understandable rules and many, many unforeseen results. There is a strong element of J-horror, too: one of the ways that predators and parasites come through into our world is via technology, and via places that have some profound impact on our cultural consciousness -- NATO nuclear test sites, for example. This is modern horror, set in the strange nooks and crannies of America, the forgotten places of shadow in our nation. Stay weird, America.\na panel from Semiautomagic: The Bomb That Will Bring Us Together\nAlice is a character that Alex and Jerry developed together, and Jerry was crucial in so many aspects, from her design, to story ideas, to pushing for Alice to be based in New England, an area very familiar to both of us. The book is very scary and very disturbing, but is technically PG. While there is body horror, it is not sexual in nature, nor is there excessive gore or indeed any nudity. To be fair, we didn't need to resort to cheap thrills in Semiautomagic. It's more a book of creeping, unsettling horror that stays with you long after you're done.\nRead the first eight pages of our first Semiautomagic story below! It was published in Dark Horse Presents #4, in 2014.\nThe 104-page softcover is 100% complete. Of the new stories, all are written, and Jerry is well into drawing the longer of his two stories, \"Childhood's End\". Lara has begun work on her story, \"A Town Called Malice\". The series' original editor, Brendan Wright, has joined us on a freelance basis, and Dark Horse is handling design and printing because they have fabulous deals with their printers that we can't even imagine (this means you get a much better quality book, and we get a much lower print bill!).\nDark Horse will be releasing just the 104-page softcover in June. (It's in February Previews right now). They will NOT be selling the box set, or the 80-page new book. The new book is only available as part of the box set in this Kickstarter, and we're only planning to print 1,000 of them. Our box set should be ready to send to backers in August.\nWhat you're getting:\nFunding goal: $21,000\nPrinting, shipping, covers, kickstarter fees, plus art for \"Childhood's End\". \n*Book 1: 104-page softcover collection of Jerry, Alex, and Marissa's two Semiautomagic arcs in Dark Horse Presents: The Bomb That Brings Us Together and Throne of Blood. \n*Book 2: 28-page new Semiautomagic story, drawn by Jerry Ordway and coloured by Marissa Louise: \"Childhood's End\". Alice plunges into Seussian madness while investigating a Howard Hughes-esque recluse in a shuttered Maine mansion. See updates for Jerry's pages in progress!\n*Hardcover case / box with cover by Jerry Ordway.\nnb: printing, shipping and fees is most of this goal. Le sigh.\nStretch goal #1: $26,000\nArt for \"A Town Called Malice\".\n*Book 2 becomes 60 pages, adding a 32-page story drawn by Lara Margarida and coloured by Marissa Louise: \"A Town Called Malice\". Alice's friend Harriet, who is unstuck in time and falls into a different timestream every 24 hours, attempts to rescue a woman who made a wish while burning her wedding bouquet... and is now dealing with the horrifying consequences of that wish coming true. It's about what happens to manic pixie dreamgirls after they marry the damaged hero, and when the manic pixie-ness isn't enough any more to paper over that damage.\nBut why have Lara draw this and not Jerry? Lara is an amazing artist in her own right, and as this is a story about Harriet (not Alice, our usual main character) we thought it would be lovely to bring in a rising star alongside Jerry. Plus, with Jerry already providing almost 40 pages of new story, we wanted all three new stories to be drawn and the box set to be out within a reasonable time after the Dark Horse collection came out -- not practicable if we added another 32 pages to Jerry's workload. See updates for Lara's pages in progress! \nStretch goal #2: $28,000\n Art for \"The Hollow Man\".\n*Book 2 becomes 80 pages, adding a 12-page story drawn by Jerry Ordway and coloured by Marissa Louise: \"The Hollow Man,\" as Alice goes to Los Angeles and finds out what is eating a famous actor. \nStretch goal #2: $31,000\n A Tomer Hanuka cover.\n*Hardcover case/box gets an exclusive Tomer Hanuka cover. Tomer Hanuka is a legendary Israeli illustrator who also provided the cover to Alex's Smoke/Ashes book, and Alex kinda has a thing about unifying design across her books. \n* * *\nOriginal cover for debut instalment of Semiautomagic in Dark Horse Presents #4\nI have questions! Course ya do, sunshine.\nI love Jerry Ordway! Yeah, we do too :D. But I'm really sad you don't have more sketch or commission rewards! We don't have them because we love Jerry. He is already setting aside a massive chunk of time to draw the Semiautomagic pages, and frankly we don't want Kickstarter to eat his life. We also want any commission income to go straight to him. So, if you DO want a Jerry Ordway commission to go with your book, at his normal commission rates, please message us and we'll put you in touch to work that out directly with him!\nAlso where are the prints and posters and buttons and stuff? Do you dig those? For real? Because I've backed like 50 Kickstarter projects and all I really want is the darn book. I have whole drawers of cards and mini-prints and other kerfuffle that got sent along with the darn book that I just... ignore. But hey, you're the boss. If enough of you message us and are like \"we will die if we all don't get buttons\", heck, we'll do buttons.\nBut why isn't Dark Horse just publishing this? Why do you have to Kickstart? Everyone involved in this project has families, and does comics as their full-time career. That means it's pretty hard to be like \"I'm just gonna take three months off getting paid and do some pages for fun\". Alas, our mortgage companies don't take \"exposure\". And graphic novels just don't make enough money that Dark Horse can hand us $30k and be like, \"sure, you crazy kids run along and write/draw more horror stories!\". For example: we are likely to sell as many copies of Semiautomagic in this Kickstarter as Dark Horse will in the first month of the 104-page collection's release. We are so, so thrilled that Dark Horse is being supportive of us and is already helping us so much with design and by letting us leverage the agreements they have with their printers... let's not be greedy, shall we?\nThe first panel of Semiautomagic: Throne of Blood\nWould you do more Semiautomagic stories after this? Heck yes. We have so many we want to do... but we're not cheap dates (we can't actually afford to live on the sort of indie-comic page rates projects like this usually get), and we're doing the book in an unfashionable format: short one- and two-issue stories that sometimes build into other things and sometimes don't, rather than six-issue arcs \"for the trade\" (and the option). I'm really hoping this Kickstarter is successful so we can come back and do another one for more new work after this... perhaps a \"Semiautomagic Annual\" that we could send separately? Oh the dreams we have! But let's get this baby funded first.\nAre there zombies or vampires in Semiautomagic? No.\nWhy not hardcover editions? $$$$. Like, maybe if we hit all our stretch goals and then overfund, I'll upgrade everyone? But for us, more story content is a higher priority than hard covers. What do you think?\nSo what if you do crazy-overfund? Kinda just got a temptation to divide any overfunds around the entire creative team, rather than killing ourselves to do extra stuff. You don't make a lot of money in comics. We're all just scraping by, honestly, and a little bonus would be nice.\nWhy aren't you willing to suffer for your art? Because that's charming at 20 and truly tedious by 40.\nCan I have just the new book? No. \nNo points for guessing he's not a good guy.\nHow did you come up with the pricing for the books? (Cost of creation) / (Print Run) + (Error margin) = Book price. Yeah, we wish it was a bit cheaper too, but even with DH on our side, a box set print run for 180 pages of content ain't cheap.\nI'm a retailer and I want to sell this set in my store. Do you have a retailer package? OKAY FINE I ADDED ONE JEEZ GUYS. Please bear in mind there is the $12.99 Dark Horse 104-pager (eg half our box set) that comes out in June, and our box set won't come out until August at earliest. \nIs this your first time at the rodeo? Oh, heck no. I raised $32,000 in the early days of Kickstarter for my graphic novel Ashes. It proved a far more challenging project than expected, and we did deliver 9 months late. Hopefully making up for that, we delivered twice the book we promised (it became a collected edition of Ashes and its 2005 prequel Smoke), in a better format than promised (cased hardbacks for everyone!), and with a more exciting lineup of artists than promised (Sienkiewicz! Doran! McNeil! Gu\u00e9ra!). And we turned around every book to ship to backers in less than a week after they arrived. So, when life gives you lemons, punch them so hard you shatter the space-time continuum. Or something.\nSEMIAUTOMAGIC: OPENING 8 PAGES\n(Originally printed in Dark Horse Presents #4.

Her recent books No Mercy and Archie vs Predator have achieved both critical and commercial success, and her Grindhouse series at Dark Horse started the recent revival of exploitation-cinema comic books. Valentine, her groundbreaking fantasy-thriller digital comic with Christine Larsen, is widely credited as having established the digital-native storytelling techniques used by the flood of later digital-native graphic stories It's also been downloaded over half a million times. Alex lives in Northern New England with her daughter and a pair of rescue dogs.\nJerry Ordway is a legendary comics artist and writer, known mostly for his work at DC. He has famous runs on Superman, Crisis on Infinite Earths, and Captain Marvel. He can draw anything, from the sweetest and most romantic Superman / Lois portrait to the most visceral horror. He lives in New England with his family.\nMarissa Louise is a Portland-based illustrator, colourist and thinker who has brought her dazzling and modern touch to Semiautomagic from the beginning.\nLara Margarida is a comics and storyboard artist based in the UK. We all love her and she's gonna be the next big thing. You heard it here first.\nBrendan Wright is a freelance editor with nearly a decade of experience in in the field, between Dark Horse Comics, Top Shelf Productions, and independent projects. He was the original, developing editor on Semiautomagic. He is based in Portland.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk with this project is it being late. Though one book (the 104-page Dark Horse Presents collection of Semiautomagic) is already complete and Jerry and Lara have already started on their pages for the 80-page second book, it is never beyond the realms of possibility that an artist could have something come up in their life that means a deadline needs to be missed.\n\nWe have a pretty good infrastructure in place to manage this: the series' original editor Brendan Wright is riding shotgun on everyone; we have Dark Horse itself managing the design and printing; and lord knows I've successfully managed and delivered on a comics Kickstarter before where a lot of unexpected issues came up. (Unlike Ashes, however, this project is: smaller, far more substantially complete, and involves a team I already know well and trust. In other words, maybe I learned my lesson.) \n\nI also feel that the experience of Ashes taught me that backers should be able to ask for refunds at any time up until the book is in the mail, if they are unhappy with the way the project is going or any delays in it. Although we do not expect delays, I really loved the \"anytime refund\" policy we had at Ashes and will continue it with Semiautomagic.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "New ONE WEEK ONLY Kickstarter for two sci-fi graphic novels", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #19", "update_userinfo": "ALL BOOKS ARE SENT", "update_content": "Hey everybody!

What the heck is \"Alterna\" anyways?\nGood question!\nAlterna's a creator-owned comic book and graphic novel publisher. Yes, we've been around for 10 years and yes, you might be hearing about us for the first time.  The good news is, you're here now and now you know about us... and knowing is half the battle!\nAlterna is funded by the creators that bust their butts to make the books.  We're not funded by investors, we're not owned by a multi-billion dollar corporate juggernaut. We're the little guy (yes, even after 10 years!) and we're taking to kickstarter to celebrate our 10 year anniversary with all of you!\nSo what are you making?\nLoaded with good questions today, huh?\nWe're making TWO books... well, technically three (but who's counting)...\nBook 1 - A 40 page FULL COLOR character guide filled with amazing characters from our creator-owned catalog.  Remember the trading cards of the 90's with all the cool character info on the back? This is kind of like that, but in comic book size and with one regular cover and one blank variant cover for artists and collectors!\nBook 2 - An Alterna AnniverSERIES Anthology FILLED with some of our best stories from the past ten years. Some of this material has never seen print as it was only published digitally. There's also stretch goals in place to double the size of this book, up to 400 pages thick! Between its covers you'll find space-traveling children, swash-buckling sky pirates, zombies invading the battlefields of World War 2, sadistic prison guards, wise-cracking Area 51 agents, an alien with an identity crisis, a band on the run, an ass-kicking woman warrior with a demon-slaying hand of magic... and so much more! The Alterna AnniverSERIES Anthology is the absolute perfect addition for readers old and new.\nLike us on FACEBOOK\nFollow us on TWITTER\nClick Here to Read a Brief History about Alterna!\nCURRENT TITLES that will be represented in the Alterna AnniverSERIES Anthology!\nThe 40 page character guide is a LIMITED EDITION release with just 250 in print.  The Alterna AnniverSERIES anthology will boast 200 pages (and if we hit certain stretch goals, we'll upgrade the book's interior and cover stocks, and add an extra 200 pages PLUS make it full color!) will have a larger print run and will also be distributed in retail stores across the world. \nThe $3500 goal will cover the print runs of the character guides (full color) and anthology (black & white), shipping, and kickstarter fees.

The plots pull the best bits from classic horror sagas to wild westerns to Three Stooges slapstick and mix them all together in one big cauldron.\nMonstrous tells the tales of everyday monsters, robots, and townspeople caught up in the changes sweeping Europe in the wake of Dr. Frankenstein\u2019s mad science. But even in this twisted landscape, our unconventional heroes\u2014giant rabbit monsters, steam-powered cyborgs, and babysitting bank robbers\u2014all try to live by their own code of honor.\nSo fire up your steampunk rocket-sled and jump onboard!\nMonstrous is not like any other comic available today. It takes classic monster characters\u2014like Dr. Frankenstein, Dracula, Frankenstein\u2019s monster, and Igor\u2014and gives them a fresh jolt of electricity. This world features steam-powered robots, voodoo magic, and more blaster fights than you can shake a lightning rod at. Plus, whatever your tastes, there is something in these books to get excited about: jokes, adventures, chills, mysteries, and more!\nAnother unique feature: the Monstrous stories all feature amazing female characters. From a brassy, sassy little girl to a devoted deputy trying to protect her jail to bumbling criminal monster sisters who tease each other endlessly, these are not your typical comic book characters. And that\u2019s a good thing! These damsels wind up in distress, but they are strong, clever, resourceful, and just as likely to jump into bar fights as their male counterparts.\nThe art is gorgeous. The characters are wild. And the stories are pure fun. Treat yourself to Monstrous today.\nAnd grab plenty of copies for the horrible creatures you keep in your laboratory at home, too!\nMake sure you follow along with us by \"liking\" us on Facebook!  Let's Get Monstrous!\nAuthor Greg Wright has long harbored a strong desire to do a comic series that twists the Frankenstein mythos and blends it up with steampunk robotics and anti-heroes straight from \"True Grit\" and \"Three Men And A Baby.\"  Greg found out about this long-harbored, and strangely specific, desire when he started writing the first script for MONSTROUS!\nSomehow (no one knows how, or why, or what transpired, or who may or may not have a soul left to sell) but Greg recruited artist extraordinaire Ken Lamug to start putting these weird stories into pencil and ink.  What they ended up creating was, for lack of a better term, MONSTROUS!\nGreg and Ken were 3 issues into the series when it came to our attention here at Source Point Press.  We'd already worked with Greg on his book, Wild Bullets (available here) from the Michigan Comics Collective and we immediately fell in love with the dark and focused imagery of Ken's art.  When we learned they were looking for a publisher, we signed them up immediately!\nWith the book already completed, why kickstart it?  Good question!  For us, it allows us to directly interact with potential fans of the book and build our audience from the ground up in a more personal way.  We don't think we'll ever ignore the direct market, but Kickstarter allows us to directly interface with fans and offer some extra bonuses for pre-ordering the book and for getting more directly involved with us as publishers and the creators we work with.  It also takes a huge amount of financial pressure off of us (we're a small company) and allows us to proceed with our print with a great deal more confidence!  \nMonstrous #1:  Hire Power\nThe quiet villages of Frankenstein\u2019s Europe are about to get a whole lot louder. When a little girl\u2019s father is killed by a monster, she seeks revenge\u2014by hiring an even tougher monster. The two of them face steam-powered robot cops and undead monster gangsters, but when they find the criminal they\u2019re hunting, the results are monstrous\u2026\nMonstrous #2:  Steam-Powered Avenger\nMonsters, robots, and Igor with a shotgun! What would you do if your brain was put into a massive, steam-powered robot? You\u2019d get revenge on the people who put it there, of course. Now add a case of dynamite, some laser blasters, and a wise-cracking hunchback, and you\u2019ve got a recipe for something monstrous\u2026\n Monstrous #3:  Three Monsters and a Baby\nTaking care of a baby can be monstrous\u2026 Three bumbling monster criminals on the run from the law accidentally wind up as babysitters. But they\u2019ve got bigger problems than diapers because that baby is being hunted by Dracula and an army of vampires.\nMonstrous #4:  Keepin' Em Out of Jail\nAn epic battle\u2014featuring monsters, robots, and cops\u2014is about to make the jailhouse rock!

I'm Joel Hodgson. \nOnce upon a time, a television series called MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 was born. We debuted on Minneapolis' KTMA, local television, on Thanksgiving Day 1988, as the world was in the final throes of Teddy Ruxpin-mania. That was almost thirty years ago, but for some reason, people still seem to like the show \u2013 it\u2019s a mitzvah!\nOur show has had a long, strange run. Across a UHF channel, a cable network, cancellation, a feature film, then another cable network, the show lasted for 12 years, two generations of hosts and puppeteers, 2 Emmy nominations and a total of 197 episodes before we got canceled again for good in 1999. Sadly, it was just as Prince predicted.\nBut maybe that's not where it all ends.\nStarting today, we finally get a chance to bring back MST3K.\nWith your help, we can create a new season of MST3K, prove there's still an audience, and maybe even convince a network to bring us back for more.\nGreat question.\nThe simplest answer is that there are a lot of cheesy movies left to riff, and a lot of people who would still enjoy watching them with us.\nPlus, I think there's a place for us. Nowadays, riffing is everywhere! Many people claim that MST3K created a shift in the way people watch TV shows, and that now, as a result, the fields of entertainment have been plowed and readied for a riffing renaissance.\nI mean, look at the influence it\u2019s had... Everyone riffs on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. Hell, there are ten to twelve people who are still, unironically, riffing on MySpace and Friendster.\nIn a world where riffing has become as common as our national pastime, baseball, it makes sense: like baseball, everyone knows how to play, but sometimes it feels good to just sit back and watch the original movie riffing team take a whack at it. And if we came back, imagine all the riffs we could make about things like Uber or Cards Against Humanity!\nAlso, there\u2019s a pile of scriptural evidence in whichever sacred text that you hold dear to prove that we need more seasons of MST3K\u2026 so when you share on social media, you know you\u2019re not going to offend anybody.\nYou know, I just read that last sentence... and actually, I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re going to offend everybody. But at least you can rest assured that you\u2019ll offend everyone equally.\nWe do, and here's why: I think it's because MST3K is more than just movie riffing. It's a stranger and denser recipe than just saying smart aleck things to a forgotten movie, but I think this is the secret ingredient: we believed that it's easiest to survive the cheesy movie that we're living in with friends who keep us from taking it all too seriously.\nNow, I don\u2019t want to get too maudlin about it, because being too serious is the enemy of comedy. We weren't trying to send a message: job #1 was always to make a funny show. But while we were doing that, I hope we also helped show the kids that society, and the stupid things we say and do to each other, are \"just a show, and you should really just relax.\u201d\nYeah, this is what I was afraid of. Now I\u2019m starting to sound like the Dr. Bronner's label. Next question?\nThe simplest answer is: until now, we couldn't bring MST3K back.\nI've been thinking about ways to re-animate MST3K for over a decade... and over the last 15 years, I've met thousands of you who said that you wanted MST3K back too. But two things have finally changed that make this the right time. And I'm not talking about the legalization of marijuana or the proliferation of water jet pack use.\n1. Crowdfunding gives fans the power to get what they want.\nIn less than two years, I've watched fans use crowdfunding to bring back Veronica Mars, Reading Rainbow and Super Troopers \u2013 all cult favorites, like us \u2013 and it made me wonder how MSTies would respond if we had the chance to return. Now we're going to find out\u2026 and then maybe LeVar Burton can finally stop acting like he\u2019s so much better than us.\n2. We had to work through some complicated legal issues.\nEven though we've always wanted to bring MST3K back, it wasn't that easy. Thanks to the Last Will and Testament of one eccentric old heiress, the rights were tied up for years. It took time to work those issues out, but with the help of my friends at Shout Factory, a special chokehold I perfected in WuDang that I like to call \u201cThe Persuader,\u201d and a night I had to spend in a haunted house as a term of the the old lady\u2019s will, we succeeded.\nThis summer, we finally got all of the rights cleared up\u2026 and now, like Orpheus, we can now descend into hell to hang out with a couple of wisecracking robots.\nNow we're talking!\nOur Kickstarter campaign has two really important goals.\nAs soon as we reach our minimum goal of $2,000,000, we'll be able to make three new feature length episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000. But then, for each additional $1.1 million we raise, we can make three more... up to a full season of 12 episodes!\n(If you're wondering why new episodes cost so much \u2013 especially the first three \u2013 keep going down the page to \"HOW WE'LL USE YOUR MONEY,\" or take a look at the Backer Update where I explained the budget in detail.)\nHere's a simple diagram to help you remember our goals:\nIf we can raise even more than that, I'd love to shoot some (or all) of the new season LIVE in front of an audience \u2013 and maybe even stream the show live on the internet! (Oh yeah: I just saw your eyes light up.)\nFinally, if we raise $1 BILLION \u2013 stay with me on this one \u2013 we\u2019re going to adopt a real live teenage boy and \u201cTruman Show\u201d him into believing he is the Pumaman!\nHear us out, because this goal is just as important: we're not just crowdfunding because we need funding. \nWe're also doing it because we need the crowd!\nIf we want a lot more MST3K, we need to work together to prove that there's still an audience out there that wants MST3K \u2013 and that this isn't all some pitiable delusion \u2013 so that we can find a network or online platform who will agree to pick up the show and keep it going\u2026 hopefully for another 200+ episodes.\nEven if you can only spare $5 or $10, every extra backer helps us send a message to the networks: it's time to #BringBackMST3K.\n____\nOkay. It's time for me to put away the grease gun and give you your marching orders.\nIf any of this rings true to you, we need your help now to spread the word. Back in the day, every episode of MST3K ended with a message that encouraged fans to \u201cKeep Circulating the Tapes.\u201d And you guys did.\nThose grassroots efforts helped MST3K find friends and fans at a time when the rest of show business didn\u2019t quite know what to make of us. It was social media in its most primitive form... and because of you, it worked.\nToday's, it's time to update that phrase for the internet age. If you're with us, this is your call to action, MSTies.\nAnd while you're at it, you can help out even more by taking a minute to follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. (Apparently those matter more than Nielsen ratings, now!)\nListen, I know this Kickstarter idea isn\u2019t for everyone. Neither was Mystery Science Theater 3000. But just like MST3K itself, I know the right people will get it.\nThanks for reading. I hope you'll join us. \nJoel\nDear People of the Internet,\nWelcome to my first-ever Official Crow-Funding Campaign. Tee Hee!\nAs #1 Golden Shiny Boy Champion, I need a place to shine bright and inspire. I want to be a part of your life again, serving in both a wind-beneath-your-wings and an ASRM capacity. You know you still want me, baby, but allow me to tell you why.\nFirst, I like POP! Figures. I intend to roll most of the money into Funko stock. Plus a few hat parties.\n\nAlso, I\u2019d like to open up a long-overdue public dialogue on Cee-Lo Green and his fashion choices.\n\nThen, I plan on turning at least a thousand dollars\u2019 worth of funds into pennies, which I will press into elongated souvenir coins at theme parks and fairs.\n\nFinally, if you are still undecided, I ask you to consider this: after years of waiting, I will finally get to decide who lives and who dies. You don\u2019t want to be on the wrong list, do you?\nI look forward to your loyal service in the many years of the New Golden Age to come.\nYour Future Supreme Being,\nCrow T. Robot\nHello, Ladies.\nI'm pleased to be with you again. It's been too long. Now that we're about to be a huge crowdfunding hit, I've got a few things I'd like to discuss with you.\nIt turns out that the last 15 years have been kind to our legacy: we're famous now. And not internet famous, either. Real famous. I have lots of female fans.\nAngelina, Scarlett, and many women named Madison: I've got parts in the new show with your names on them. You can come over and we can run lines in my bungalow, and I\u2019ll make us a curry. Then if things get \u201cconsensual,\u201d so be it.\nI\u2019ll also pretty much be the \u201ctroubleshooter\u201d on this Kickstarter campaign, because I understand how you think and I\u2019m a master of social media. My god: you do realize that I\u2019m the uncredited creator of both memes and avatars?\nI\u2019M ALSO THE FIRST SENTIENT BEING TO TYPE A MESSAGE IN ALL CAPS.\nWhat are you waiting for? Get out to the Kickstarter polls and start voting.\nYours,\nTom Servo\nHey everyone. It's Joel again.\nLook, I know what you're wondering, so go ahead\u2026 just say it.\nBelieve me, man. I get it. If it cost $2 million just to make three episodes, we'd be spending almost $700K per show! And you're right: by itself, an episode of MST3K doesn't cost nearly that much. \nThe real explanation is pretty simple.\n1. We don't get to keep all of the money we raise on Kickstarter! \nCAMPAIGN FEES: Out of the first $2,000,000, we have to pay about 8% \u2013 that's $160,000 \u2013 in fees to Kickstarter and the credit card processor.\n\nREWARD & SHIPPING COSTS: Then, we have to design, produce, print, sort and ship all of the rewards we're offering in exchange for your pledge. (Those t-shirts aren't free, you know!) That costs about 27%, so that's another $540,000.\n(We're not charging you twice for shipping, I promise. Even though Kickstarter asks you to add more for shipping, they count that money toward the total we've raised, even though we still have to spend it on, you know\u2026 shipping!)\nSo, out of the first $2,000,000 we raise, we have to spend $700,000 just on the costs of this Kickstarter campaign!\n2. Then, we have to spend a lot on startup costs just to get the show going. \nTo shoot new episodes, there's a lot we'll need to do: creating concept art and designs, building sets, making models, creating costumes, adding new features to upgrade the robots, and all sorts of other things. All of that work costs money, which is why our first $2,000,000 includes $550,000 for startup costs. The good part is that every penny of that ends up on screen where you can see it.\n3. But... the more episodes we make, the less each episode costs! \nWe have to spend the same amount up front, no matter how many episodes we make. If we only make 3 episodes, these costs increase the budget for each episode by $183K\u2026 but if we make a full 12, they only increase it by $46K each!\nAnyway, once you take out the CAMPAIGN, REWARD and STARTUP COSTS, there's a lot less than $2,000,000 left. In fact, that leaves just $750K for three episodes, which \u2013 I hope \u2013 sounds a lot more reasonable than $2,000,000!\nAt the end of the day, our goal is to make each episode for around $250K.\nTo put that in perspective, that means we're spending less to create 90 minutes of MST3K than even the low-end reality shows spend to make 22 minutes! (Really makes ya think, don't it?) \nNow, if you're as tired of reading as I am of writing, here are some wicked cool graphics that explain all of this:\nI know not everyone will want this much explanation, but if I'm asking you to trust me with your money, I think it's important to be crystal clear about how we're using it. \nPlus, $750K for each set of three episodes feels a lot better than $2,000,000. \n(But man, I'd hate to try to sell a car to you people. Tough crowd!)\nHopefully by now, you're already on board. Maybe you're not even reading this. Maybe you've already made your contribution, selected your rewards, and are now rushing around the internet helping spread the good word to all of your MST3K-deprived friends!\nBut if you're still on the fence, maybe I can make it easier for you.\nPersonally, I think the most compelling reason to help out is that you want to see new episodes of MST3K\u2026 and not just for you. Think of the friends and family who you can finally introduce to the new MST3K: the one with a fresh new cast, fresh new riffs, and zesty new cheesy movies!\nOn the other hand, let\u2019s not any of us forget: this is Kickstarter. I know that you know that that\u2019s gonna mean some cool rewards for helping us out. And for a show that\u2019s never really been about cool merch...I think we\u2019ve finally got some!\nUPDATE! We've gotten a lot of questions asking exactly what's included with each package, so we've put together another helpful little chart:\nYou can see all of the rewards on the right side of the page, but here are a few highlights:\nBecome... Part of MYSTERY SCIENCE HISTORY!\nAll backers \u2013 no matter what you pledge \u2013 will be invited to join the new MST3K Information Club. (It's like the old MST3K Info Club, only better. And modern. And more exclusive. And wider in the hips.) Over the next year, we'll invite you to help us rediscover MST3K and get it oiled up and running smoothly. You'll be part of the process!\nRead... Our Page-Turning Insider Updates \nWe don't just want to take your cash and walk away: we want to take your cash and talk away! Most Kickstarter projects promise \"exclusive behind-the-scenes updates,\" but this time, I mean it: I've already started planning things I want to share with you. It'll be like getting email from me, Crow and Servo for at least a year.\nPossess... Amazing, Terrifying, Heart-Warming New MST3K Swag\nBefore the end of the campaign, we'll start sharing the designs we're planning for some of the #BringBackMST3K swag you can get, including the OFFICIAL T-SHIRT ($50+), OFFICIAL MUG ($75+), OFFICIAL KEYCHAIN ($100+), OFFICIAL POSTER ($150), and many more. We've got several amazing artists working on this stuff. I can't wait for you to see it.\nTake Control.... of the New Episodes!Bringing back MST3K isn't enough power for you? Great! For real high-rollers, we're offering all sorts of ways to be part of the episodes themselves. You can\u2026\nSteal the hearts of millions when you... APPEAR IN AN EPISODE! \nThrow your weight around and\u2026 BECOME A PRODUCER! \nKickstart your new riffing career and\u2026 HELP WRITE AN EPISODE!\nImmortalize your favorite inside joke with\u2026 A PERSONAL RIFF!\nOwn and Command... Your OWN Robot Friend!\nThis one is difficult for me, but I want to make sure this Kickstarter succeeds, so I'm willing to make the sacrifice: a very limited number of you can KEEP THE ACTUAL CROW and/or SERVO FEATURED IN A NEW EPISODE! They'll record a personalized video for you, and then we'll ship them off to your doorstep. When we're done shooting.\n1. FOLLOW \"@MST3K\" ON ALL OF OUR SOCIAL CHANNELS.Be sure to follow our official accounts on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. Ask your fellow MSTies to follow them too! Tell them that those numbers have a really big impact when we start asking networks to #BringBackMST3K for more new seasons.\n2. CIRCULATE THE MESSAGES AT THE END OF EACH UPDATE. At the end of each Backer Update, Crow or Servo will share a message or image that you can copy and paste to share with your friends, to help spread the word.\n3. KEEP CIRCULATING THE FACTS\u2026 NICELY! I know there are still some fans out there who are skeptical about this Kickstarter, about why MST3K costs so much money and how we'll spend it, about bringing in a third cast, about who is and isn't going to be involved\u2026 So, like they say on the subway, \"If you see something, say something!\" If you hear fans insisting that $2MM is more than we need to make three episodes, or that the old team isn't invited back, I hope you'll share the facts with them. (Please be nice, though! The internet needs a lot more of that.)\n4. JOIN (OR START) A LOCAL MST3K MEETUP GROUP.\nThe internet is great, but sometimes riffing is even better when you can meet old (and new) friends in person! There are already a lot of MST3K groups on meetup.com, but if there's not one near you, start one now and invite your friends! We've got some events planned for this month, and we'll be calling on all the local groups to be part of them.\nAs long as we have the funds we need, we'll be able to produce new episodes. That part is easy! But over the last month, I've had lots of time to think about all the possible risks and challenges MST3K could face...\nMAYBE THE WORLD HAS CHANGED!\nMST3K has been away for a long time. YouTube didn't even exist when we shot the last episode of MST3K. (Yes, Virginia, there was a world before YouTube. People laughed more back then. Colors were brighter. There were concerts in the park.)\nI've imagined many hypothetical risks:\nWhat if no one enjoys watching B-movies anymore? \n What if you don't want us talking while you do? \n What if there is an unknown virus that has killed mankind's ability to enjoy a good solid ironic viewing? \nWhat if kids playing in \u201cGarry\u2019s Mod\u201d on Twitch have made the whole thing meaningless? \nWhat if robot-shaped puppets don\u2019t have the overwhelming cultural significance they once did? \nWhat if our collective consciousness can\u2019t take the excitement, and the entire world becomes a flash mob, and we all steal our own TVs?\nWhat if all eight billion people on the planet become a single \u201cImprov Everywhere\u201d troupe, but don\u2019t have anyone left to surprise?!?\nAs you can see, this whole endeavor is fraught with risks.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've been over this!

We need your help. \nThis anthology is a result of a lot of hard work by two normal average joes with a passion for telling stories. We've loved comics since forever, and if we aren't making comics we are reading them. \nThe Adventures In Pulp Anthology started life as a webcomic, written by Brett Harris and illustrated by Matthew Childers, primarily because printing comics is an expensive business and both of us have families to feed. However we love comics we can hold in our hands, the touch and feel of the paper in our hands, even the smell of fresh ink on a page. There is nothing like it for a comic book lover. Webcomics are a wonderful tool to showcase our work, but nothing beats how these comics look in print. And this is why we need your help.\nOver the past two years we have worked to create four amazing stories, all while working our day jobs and doing projects for other publishers. We've even put our own money on the table to print normal sized issues of some of the stories. But we are moving on to a new set of stories and we think the time has come to collect our first four stories in a format that it was always meant to be seen in. \nWe have always just been two guys, in their studios, creating stories that we love, in the hopes that some amazing fan will discover and enjoy too. But now we can't do it alone. We need new members of the Adventures In Pulp team. We need Adventurers who would like to join us on this journey to create an amazing book.\nWith your help not only can we get our book to print but you'll get some pretty cool stuff too! We also encourage everyone to leave us a comment, help us make this project better... this is our baby, but this can be yours too! \n The Adventures In Pulp Collected Edition is a trade paperback collection of four of the Adventures In Pulp stories; Dick Ruby, Hawk and A Handsaw, The Four Horsemen, and Ashes of the Immortals. These four stories first appeared online at AdventuresInPulp.com. We are looking for comic book and pulp enthusiasts who enjoy reading fun stories and holding a book in their hands. The great thing with this project in particular is that the majority of the pages are done. The only part of this book left to create are six pages of EXCLUSIVE CONTENT! That's right! Not only do you get the four stories featured on our website but we are including a six-page never before seen story exclusive to the Collected Edition. BUT THAT'S NOT ALL! With our cosmic level we are also giving a select few people the chance to become characters in the exclusive story, one person may even be drawn as THE VILLAIN! Want more? Of course you do...\nThe Collected Edition will be 68 interior pages\nForward & Introduction - 2 pages \nDick Ruby Intros and Cover - 1 pages \nDick Ruby Story - 14 pages \nHawk And A Handsaw Intros and Cover - 1 pages \nHawk And A Handsaw Story - 13 pages \nThe Four Horsemen Intros and Cover - 1 pages \nThe Four Horsemen Story - 13 pages \nAshes of the Immortals Intros and Cover - 1 pages \nAshes of the Immortals Story - 14 pages \nExclusive Story Content - 6 pages \nThank you pages - 2 pages\nArtwork from the book!\nHere are some of the pages from Dick Ruby and The Case of the Little Green men\nAnd pages from Hawk And A Handsaw\n Pages from The Four Horsemen\n And two pages from Ashes of the Immortals\nReward Packages!\nThank You and we hope you will join the Adventures In Pulp team!

Faced with a new century and new steam technology, the social and political status quo is turned on its head. People are uncomfortable with change and, in fact, many people fear it. That fear and the violence which follows causes a psychic rift to puncture the veil of space and time allowing the entity known as \"The Shifter\" to escape. Feeding on the resentment and fear between the rich and poor, \u201cThe Shifter\u201d triggers a rash of murders.

We saw it move, and called us Center. Then stories, and myths, and happy little comforts- but they held us. Bound and in stupor we crept. Until, we learned the beauty of being wrong. It swept away the spell of firmament, until we finally gazed down upon our suspended world. We moved far, building, and changing other worlds. Slowly, did we do this, for the oceans and valleys of our world ill prepared us for the utter cold and licking heat of Space. And the dull, chill, quiet .   \n     But still longing for a voice, the old melodies rang like brass bells in the minds of the lonely few. Contact made, a deal struck, and the lonely would return to their myths. Calamity and Choir. And so ended science, and the love of being wrong..  \n     But such a legacy was not without its artifacts. A child was born on a satellite - our furthest reach from home. Ignorant to the dire transaction the world had made, she returns sleeping in her capsule. Science, meet the Choir.\nScout, first born of Titan.\nToo cryptic? OK, I'll give away a bit more. After the Gold Rush tells the story of the Titan-born Scout, as she returns to her ancestral home of Earth. The first issue is a little more Twilight Zone than the rest of the series. But, like science, After the Gold Rush starts with a mystery. So that's all for now! \nAs we have it planned, the story unfolds over twenty five issues. ATGR #1 will be 22 pages, for the main story. With several pages of special features. We plan on doing a series of paper issues, digital issues, and trade paper backs later on. But, this Kickstarter is to get that all rolling!   \nIsaac La Russa, Miles Greb, and Michael Shephard\nMiles Greb - Creator & Writer - Former Bob Dylan impersonator who's obsession with Star Trek is annoying to everyone. \nIsaac La Russa - Lead Artist & Concept Artist -Based in Illinois, he wears motley flannels and owns two ungrateful cats.\nMichael Shepard - Colorist -  Very much like Mario Paint for SNES, but far more useful.\nAndrew Pierce - Editor - Lovable goof and word-launderer. Escaped Kipling protagonist. \nJamie Me - Lettering - Letterer who spends his time wearing pajamas called a 'gi' while learning the art of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.\nMichelle Man - Guest Artist - Former New Yorker, current San Fransisco-ER? Kinder towards plants and other people's animals than probably anyone she's met.\nBarry Blankenship -Cover Artist & Logo Design - Amateur cursing cat ventriloquist.\nBen Rodgers - Assistant Editor - Historian of historical biographies, at least he was historically.\nPoster Team -  David Hovey and Chris Lewis Lee.\nYou can follow the project closer at - @Goldrushcomic. \nScout, Biology nerd.\n    After the Gold Rush has three major goals. The first is to tell a good story, that will matter. None of our other aspirations will manifest without a rich narrative. The motivations for ATGR are much more - but they are nothing without a rich narrative. \n    At a con last year, I saw some wonderful and a few worrying trends in comics. The wonderful was the focus on perspectives from many different sub-cultures. I am a huge fan of Silver Age books; the early Marvel books created the artistic dialect for most the medium. The good of this precedent is the optimistic Sci-Fi expansionism, heroic deeds, and fantastic ideas. The bad, was that these wonderful stages lack diversity in their actors. This is now changing in Comics. But while I saw this inclusion for so many groups, I did not see a single book that was openly created by or for atheists, skeptics, and the hard science crowd.\n    The worrying trend is fear. Science has been playing the role of the atom bomb again, instead of the moon-lander. Tomorrow will be dark, there will be zombies, the buildings around you will be empty, you will be scavenging, the robots are coming, there is no help, the future will crush us, technology will twist and defame us \u2013 The end is now. No! This is not how it\u2019s going to be. I grew up watching Cosmos and Star Trek, and that\u2019s the future I see. That is what I want to bring back.\nATGR #1, page 2.\nATGR #1, page 10.

We have the book, three wonderful posters, hand crocheted scarfs, custom drawings, and more! \nDue to the high cost of shipping internationally, only some levels are available for our international fans. Of course, the digital version of the book is accessible to all peoples from all planets. Except to Cardassians! \nIf all goes according to plan, we should be shipping books out late December, to mid January. I will update will all relevant info here as dates approach. \nPosters\nPosters will be printed 18 x12, with a glossy finish, on a quality stock.

Jane drank more than she wrote, worried more than she worked, and had more epically disastrous love affairs than completed books. By almost any measure, Jane led a fascinating life filled with literary giants and great adventure and I want to bring her story to life.\nSketches of Jane at various ages by Tyler Jenkins\n\u201cAlthough unknown to the general public, the Bowleses were famous among those who were famous.\u201d \u2013 Gore Vidal \n\u201cMy only complaint against Mrs. Bowles is that she publishes so infrequently. One would prefer larger quantities of her strange wit, thorny insight. Certainly she is one of the really original pure stylists.\u201d \u2013 Truman Capote \nThis Kickstarter is going to help fund the creation and publication of chapter one of an original graphic novel written by me, Katy Rex, about Jane\u2019s life. This book will be published as a standalone issue and follow Jane\u2019s life from childhood up until a freak accident on a horse that led her to be diagnosed with tuberculosis of the knee. It includes art from Tyler Jenkins (Peter Panzerfaust, Neverboy) on the main biography, and June Vigants on the short story, in full color with a stunning and evocative palette from Kelly Fitzpatrick (Sensation Comics). Editor Kirsten Thompson contributes a unique perspective on history and feminism. It will also include Jane\u2019s short story, A Stick Of Green Candy, about the nature of love and childhood innocence and the death of imagination. An inset medical diagram art piece from artist Kate Lacour will detail the intricacies of joint tuberculosis. This campaign will allow the project to continue and build into a full length book, and will be an opportunity for backers to get the exclusive rewards that will not be available once the book is fully produced. This single extra thick issue, coming in at a full 28 printed pages, will also feature an essay from Lauren Spohrer, editor of the online magazine Two Serious Ladies, which publishes original poetry and prose from women around the world.\ntuberculosis of the knee as rendered by artist Kate Lacour\nThis original graphic novel will follow Jane Bowles' life in ten chapters. In each chapter, there is an adaptation of one of her short stories, and each short story is adapted by a different artist. The artistic team adapting short stories includes art from Dom Sole, Betsy Peterschmidt (Boys with Wings), Ines Estrada (Ojitos Borrosos, Lapsos), June Vigants (Chainmail Bikini, Tales of the Night Watchman), Joshua Hixson (The Rebel Gun), Anne Maxson, Beatrice Penco Sechi (Lady Doll), Ryan Kelly (Lucifer, Local), Adam Gorham (Zero, Kill Shakespeare), and Sean Von Gorman (Toe Tag Riot, Pawn Shop), with a Kickstarter-exclusive cover by Marguerite Sauvage (Thor, Ninjak, The Wicked + The Divine). In order to tie together her life and stories, colorist Kelly Fitzpatrick (Sensation Comics) is creating a unifying palette and letterer/designer Taylor Esposito (Ghost Glyph Studios) will be facilitating the flow of the work.\nbacker reward: Strange Wit flask, art not final\nVery few accounts of Jane\u2019s life exist in the realm of public consumption. Some things are broadly and culturally agreed upon: She had many sexual relationships with women, she wrote sparsely and strangely but with genius and style, and when she met her husband, she said to a friend, \u201cHe is my enemy.\u201d But the cultural mythos about Mrs. Bowles does very little to capture the very real and very unique person behind her strange persona.\nChapter one is completely scripted and the art is nearly complete. Help us get it printed, and YOU (yes, you!) can be eligible for a number of exciting rewards, including: \n\u2022 Digital and physical copies before they\u2019re available anywhere else \n\u2022 Set of 10 Postcards limited edition/numbered \n\u2022 An exclusive limited edition (numbered) print of Marguerite Sauvage\u2019s portrait of Jane \n\u2022 Thank-you letter, handwritten \n\u2022 Thank-you letter, handwritten while drunk \n\u2022 A mini-comic written & (poorly) drawn by Katy: cocktail recipes of the artistic elite \n\u2022 Options for original art from the creative team, including pages from the book and full color commissions\nOne of the cool things about working with a creative team of this scale is that we are able to collect work from each one of the short story artists in a unique set of 10 postcards. Each postcard comes from a place where Jane lived and worked at the time of the chapter in which that artist's short story is featured.\nTitle page by artist Tyler Jenkins\nSince the chapter is nearly done, rewards will be printed and shipped within a few months after the campaign ends. The money made in this Kickstarter, first and foremost, will be going toward fair page rates for the excellent and high-quality work from this diverse and unique creative team. With the full length graphic novel coming in at around 240 pages, it's not a small budget, and starting to fund it through Kickstarter brings it one step closer to being a reality. While this campaign primarily funds the production and printing of chapter one, if we surpass our goal we will be able to use the additional money to speed up the production of the final book.\nSample page from A Quarreling Pair artist Joshua Hixson\nThis book is fun to read, beautiful to look at, and covers a crucial topic in the marginalized history of LGBT artists. Thank you for considering pledging!\nUPDATE: After our awesome Comicosity interview, we decided it was probably a good idea to clarify some of our financial goals.\nThis Kickstarter is to print Chapter One of the book, and also to fund the artists' costs for the rest of the book. All backers WILL be getting a discount code for the finished graphic novel, but since that is still in the tentative future and being worked out logistically, it's not being formally included in this project. We know that $12,000 is steep for a single issue, and we're happy that so many of you are being so understanding about the rest of the creative team's needs, even though their work isn't being included in this issue. To make up for that, we're trying to pack as much unique and exclusive content into this mega-issue, including an essay and some concept sketches that will never make it into the final book and will only be available here on Kickstarter.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main obstacles this book faces are the size of the creative team and the legality of printing a book based on licensed intellectual property.

See for yourself!\nThe first 8 pages from Holidaze #1.\nThis issue, which we often referred to as \"the pilot,\" served as a sort-of prototype for the series.

The bar staff tries to substitute an old non-alcoholic brew that's been sitting in the stockroom forever, hoping no one will notice. What it does is turn Holidaze's iconic customers into beer-craving husks of flesh. And, oh, it just happens to be the day Chester, the Easter Bunny has given up drinking, leaving he and the bar staff in the middle of it all.\n\"The Walking Drunk\"\n\"Luck of the Irish\" tells the tale of what happens when St Paddy, whose life is nothing but a string of bad happenings, loses his pot of gold to a ruthless thug. Suddenly each of their lives begin to change, one for the better and the other for the absolute worse.\n\"Luck of the Irish\"\n\"How Dracula Gets His Groove Back\" - Holidaze isn't just for holiday characters. Many mythical icons saddle up to the bar, including the prince of darkness and slave to fashion, Dracula. He's changed his look a lot over the years in an effort to be trendy, but with it has come a loss of his scary image. When a potential victim laughs in his face at his lack of scare, Drac's self-esteem plummets and he finds himself in therapy with the bar's resident therapist, Dr. Headless Horseman.\n\"How Dracula Gets His Groove Back\"\n\"The Odd Couple\" finds Chester, the Easter Bunny, out of a home and needing a place to stay. His only hope lies with Cupid, who offers to rent him an apartment above his place. But can the slovenly hare and a very finicky master of love live in the same place and not drive each other batty?\n\"The Odd Couple\"\nWhat People Are Saying About Holidaze\n\u201cWhat a lot of fun!

The only other way was to pick up an individual issue as part of a small print run if you saw us at conventions (which, as just two guys with full-time jobs and family, is not a rock n roll, all-year tour extravaganza).\nSo, this is the first time Holidaze will be available to the masses via online and this campaign.\nWe\u2019ve collected the first five issues of the series, along with bonus material like pages from Andrew\u2019s sketchbook, easter eggs he\u2019s hidden through the series, deleted pages and more.\nMock-up of Holidaze Volume 1 TPB Cover\nHow YOU can help:\nYour participation is incredibly important!\nCreating a comic book and publishing a comic book are two completely different animals, and the latter gets pretty expensive.\nThis campaign will allow us to make Holidaze available, in print, to anyone who wants it, covering printing and shipping costs.\nIt also allows us to offer compensation for the countless hours of work that went into the creation of these stories to this point, most notably to artist Andrew Cieslinski, who has poured his blood and sweat into the illustrations contained within, penciling, inking, coloring and lettering every issue.\nYour support also helps us to continue producing even more issues of Holidaze stories to come.\nTHE BREAK DOWN:\nHere's how it breaks down in terms of the money being raised and what it's used for.\nAnd who doesn't love pie?\nThe Great News!\nHere\u2019s the great part - the book is already done! That means that once we get the books printed and in our hands, we can quickly ship them off to all of you wonderful folks who want to join the fun that is Holidaze.\nRewards!\nWe\u2019ve got a ton of different levels of rewards, including signed copies of the trade paperback, buttons, bookmarks, barware, original sketches, and much more!\nCheers!\nThe Secret Origin of Holidaze\nIt actually all started about 14 years ago.\nHolidaze was originally going to be a short film when I was studying screenwriting and filmmaking back in college. I was in New England driving in the car with a friend and frequent collaborator on film projects back then, watching snow fall around, and I just said \u201cI want to make a Christmas Special. But it\u2019s a comedy. For adults. Santa and Cupid, and the Easter Bunny and everybody hanging out at a bar when they\u2019re not working.\u201d\nThe short film never came to fruition, but the basic idea for what it was supposed to be became the first issue of Holidaze more than a dozen years later.\nArtist Andrew Cieslinski and I shared quite a few mutual friends.\nOne day I was having coffee with one of those mutual friends. At the time, I was working as a TV journalist and news anchor, and when you work in news, you tend to deal with a lot of bad stories day in and day out. Crimes, deaths, tragedies, assaults \u2013 all the stuff that just wears on you.\nI was really, really looking for some type of outlet for myself for a bit of escapist writing outside of the news and all those types of stories.\nOur mutual friend suggested I meet with Andrew, an incredibly talented artist, and see if we could collaborate on something. So I contacted Andrew, we grabbed coffee, and we just talked about ideas back and forth.\nIt was a terribly rainy afternoon and we were sitting at a table under a canopy outside a cafe. None of the ideas were hitting the mark. A lot was just a lot of the same we\u2019ve seen before.\nSo, for whatever reason, I pulled that old short film idea, Holidaze, out of the back of my head and Andrew really dug it.\nAnd away we went, printing under the name Dandy Press, a combination of both our names - Dave and Andy.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs we said, the best part is that the book is already done!

So are we. That's where 'OBSCURA: Collected Edition' comes in! 152-pages of pulp horror and other weird tales in an anthology-style collection! Our book is home to 18 unique tales ranging from the first fish in space to the last family alive in the Zombie Apocalypse...and everything in between. Unpredictable and totally refreshing. Inspired by surrealist ideals and obsessed with pushing the boundaries, Obscura stands as a unique oddity in the world of comics. \nCollects 'Obscura' Volumes 1-4.\nClick here for an advance review of the book!\n \"Brown and D.N.S are burning bright in the world of indie comics with their dynamic, fertile creativity. Obscura satisfies with its tight plots and darkly atmospheric art, leaving readers feeling uneasy. Which is a grandly good thing.\" -Erica Crockett, author of 'Chemicals'.\n\"In boxing it's the uppercuts that get the highlights. But it's the jabs and body blows that win the match. The stories in Obscura are quick jabs which knock you off balance. They're devastating body blows which take your breath away. You'll survive reading Obscura, but you won't forget the hits you took reading it.\"   -Kevin Joseph, author of 'Tart' and 'Underwars'.  \n\"A wild ride through the weird, the depraved and the obscene, the tales of Obscura will sit gently with you after hours, crawling into your brain hole like a festering worm - rendering all thoughts of sleep or inner peace inert.\" - Daniel Horowitz, author, 'Lord of the Twin Lands'\n\"Obscura does everything you want from a modern era horror anthology. It uses its art to build an aura of unease and to compliment the inventive stories within. Haunting, beautiful stuff!\" -Carl Smith, author of 'The Horror of Loon Lake'\n\"Obscura is horrifying in the best way possible. The stories and art linger long after you put it down, sneaking back up on you when you least expect it, like a nightmare you just can't shake.\" -Kris Peterson, thegravyage.com\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHere, you won't find guys in capes, played out super villains twirling their mustaches, story lines that require to buy 20 books to keep up or movie tie-ins. What you will find is fresh, original material made by people with no agenda other than to deliver unique, entertaining comics. In Obscura, you'll never know what's coming next. That is our vision and that's where you and Obscura: 'Collected Edition' comes in.\nObscura: Collected Edition Cover\nObscura: Collected Edition collects 'Obscura' volumes 1-4 which were all self published in limited print runs and sold out over the course of a year. What can you expect from the book, you ask? \nEverything and anything!\nThe general format of the single issue versions of the book is 3-4 short stories, a introduction from our very own narrator and a small pinup gallery per issue. Imagine pulp comics mingling with 'weird tales' and you're getting closer. The stories contained within range from avant garde to experimental to dark comedy to traditional horror tales...nothing is off limits or taboo. Rest assured, each tale contains that unique, no holds barred, Fifth Dimension Comics flavor our readers have grown to love.\nObscura was created by David M. Brown and D.N.S. who needed an outlet for stories to crazy to publish anywhere else. They were joined by letterers Philip Nolte, Robin Jones and Sean Fagan. A couple guest spots were given to indie friends Jason Ford, Shannon Gretzon and Felipe Anguiano. The result is this incredibly unique book we hope to bring to you all. \nKickstarter Exclusive Art Print by D.N.S.!\n  Kickstarter Exclusive Art Print!\nStretch Goals?

That is, until I saw Jim Lujan's animated shorts.\nJim Lujan and Bill Plympton at San Diego Comic-Con\nI was friends with Mr. Lujan long before I knew his work. I first met him when he helped interview me for an animation Web show, and then handed me his DVDs. Now, I get sent a lot of DVDs of people's work, and if I watched all of them I would never get any films done. However, one rainy afternoon when I had nothing to do, I slipped in his animation since I thought he was an amusing kind of guy.\nWell, I was stunned by the brilliance of his writing, voices, and character design \u2013 they were so rich and fascinating. I watched his animated shorts over and over. I realized his ideas and characters were a perfect fit for my animation. I called him up and suggested we create a feature film together using his story, characters, and voices.\nHe said yes and, amazingly, a few weeks later, he delivered one of the most amazing scripts I'd ever read. These were characters from the underworld sleaze of Los Angeles (a world I knew nothing about) yet his humor and characters were right out of my warped brain.\nSo far it's been a wonderful working relationship. His characters are so much fun to animate \u2013 I'm having the time of my life.\nThe film should be completed in the first half of 2016, and the more I get into it, the more excited I get about the potential of this crazy story called REVENGEANCE.\nBill Plympton\nApril 2015\nProduced, animated, and directed by Bill Plympton\nWritten, designed, voiced, and music by Jim Lujan\nTHE STORY\nREVENGEANCE tells the story of a low-rent bounty hunter (named Rod Rosse, The One Man Posse) who gets entangled in a web of seedy danger when he takes on a job from an ex-biker/ex-wrestler turned U.S. senator named \"Deathface.\" Rod has to find what was stolen from the senator and find the girl who stole it. Soon, Rosse finds there\u2019s more than meets the eye to this dirty job. Between the ruthless biker gangs, the blood thirsty cults, and the crooked cops - Rod Rosse is a marked man. If the bullets don\u2019t kill him - the California sun just might!\nRod Rosse, The One Man Posse\nThe film features the voice talents of Jim Lujan and Dave Foley (THE KIDS IN THE HALL, NEWSRADIO, A BUGS LIFE, MONSTERS UNIVERSITY).

Unfortunately, what she finds are a pair of thieves. With their meddling, her quest does not go as she hoped, and she discovers that finding a heart is a greater challenge than she ever imagined.\nSnow by Night is set in a fantasy version of colonial North America. It\u2019s a new world and a new frontier where cultures, empires, and spirituality collide. It\u2019s a time of discovery, a time of enlightenment, and a time of transition. Since this is a fantasy adventure, there is magic, but the magic is expressed through the prism of alchemy.\nSnow by Night is an ongoing webcomic that you can read online.\nThis Kickstarter campaign will fund the printing of 1,000 copies of our second volume. We published the first volume as individual chapter books. The story has grown, and it's time to shift to larger volumes that contain four chapters at a time. \nEach volume is thematically tied to one of the Seven Processes of Alchemy. Volume 2 is titled Dissolution and covers Chapters 5 through 8. Each of the chapters also has an accompanying vignette, which is a short story illustrated by guest artists.\nThe book will be 6.75\" x 10.25\" and contain 172 pages, which includes 18 pages of never-before-published bonus content only available in the book. We will not be releasing that content online. \nWe will be using Print Ninja to publish the books. They are a reliable printer that comes highly recommended by several of my webcomic colleagues.\nThe initial $9,750 goal covers printing and shipping the books as well as the rewards. I've put together a chart to show where the money is going. Money raised beyond the initial goal will be applied to additional rewards, eventually culminating in the publication of Volume 1: Calcination.\n47% will cover printing the books. This is for 1,000 copies of Volume 2 sized at 6.75\" x 10.25\". We're going full-color throughout.\n29% will cover shipping. The books must be sent by ship across an ocean to the Snow by Night Offices (i.e., Eric's house). We then have to ship all these fabulous books and prints to the backers.\n11% will cover fees. This covers the fees charged by Kickstarter and Amazon, as well as the costs of an ISBN.\n9% will cover the bonus artwork. Most of the art is already paid for, but some of the bonus content needs to be commissioned. Eric strongly believes in paying artists for work they do.\n3% will cover the rewards. Most of the rewards we're offering have already been paid for, but there are a few we still need to cover.\n1% will cover any unforeseen expenses. This covers anything that pops up that we didn't account for in our budget.\nWe've come up with a number of rewards for you to choose from. Look through the illustrations below to find something that suits you.\nIf we surpass our initial goal, we are offering a variety of additional rewards. We have so much more we want to share with you, so we're hoping to reach these.\nOffline Almanac. At $11,000, everyone at OVERSTUDY level and above would receive an offline version of the Snow by Night Almanac. The offline version would come as a PDF with internal links to allow you to hop from topic to topic with ease.\nVolume 2 PDF in French. Snow by Night is set in a fantasy version of colonial Qu\u00e9bec. At $12,000, we will have all of Volume 2 translated into French. And not just any French \u2014 Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois French \u2014 by Eric's long-suffering friend Nicholas Fillion. Magnifique!\nBonus Vignette. At $15,000, we will commission an artist to draw an additional bonus vignette. All backers of Philosopher level and above will receive a PDF copy.\nVolume 1 Printed! At $20,000, we will have Chapters 1 through 4 printed as a volume, just like Volume 2. Everyone who would receive Chapters 1-4 will instead receive Volume 1. If you were to get a PDF of Chapters 1-4 as a reward, you instead get a PDF of Volume 1.\nVolume 1 PDF in French. At $21,000, Nicholas will also translate Chapters 1-4 into French. Anyone who received the Volume 1 PDF will get a second PDF of Volume 1 in French.\nCould even more discoveries await? Oh yes. We've got plenty of ideas for more bonus content for everyone to enjoy.\n So who are we? Snow by Night is a collaboration. A lot of people contributed to this project to make it a reality.\nWriter and Letterer. Eric is a writer, game-designer, journalist, and intermittent attorney. He likes to tell stories. He's written many stories and adventures for Wizards of the Coast, including coauthoring Menzoberranzan: City of Intrigue, which was nominated for three ENnies for Best Setting, Best Supplement, and Product of the Year, as well as Best Roleplaying Supplement at the 39th Annual Origins Awards.\nThe central vision for Snow by Night is his, and he handles the scripting and the lettering. However, he's a writer \u2014 not an artist. To help with that, he brought in some of the best talent he could find.\nPenciler and Inker.

The art is complete with a few minor exceptions. We just need to get the books printed. So the primary challenges for this project are printing and shipping.\n\nDealing with any large print run involves some risks. As two examples, books may be misprinted, or books may be damaged when shipped from the printer. We're going with Print Ninja, which has a good track record for both of these. Since we're getting these printed abroad, customs might cause delays, but Eric knows some international trade attorneys and should be able to shake them loose.\n\nThen there is shipping from us to you. We are planning on using USPS Priority Mail to ship all the packages. Not only will USPS provide us with free boxes, but they are flat rate as long as we're under 4 pounds. So even if we get stretch goals that include a second volume, our shipping rate is the same. We've already checked the packaging and they will fit two volumes. Using priority mail also means that you will get your rewards faster with less chance of packages being lost in the mail.\n\nWe will inform you of any additional challenges that may arise.

As a young boy Syl witnesses the murder of his superhero father in the streets of Third City. Years later, Syl and his younger brother Arnie set out with the crew of a river boat to take him up the treacherous Hard Silt River to find answers. Set in a uniquely created post-apocalyptic future that is both horrific and fascinating, Up the River is an adventure story that puts a fresh twist on the idea of super-powered humans and a strong emphasis on character development. The comic series is penciled and inked by Stephen Sharar, colored by Sean Seal, and edited and lettered by Joshua Werner. With covers inked by Mark McKenna (X-Men, Amazing Spider-Man, Justice League, Batman)!\n *STRETCH GOALS ANNOUNCED*\n$3,000 = Everyone at $10 tiers and above will receive a free print of the cover art (without logos) by artist Mark McKenna (Batman, X-Men, Justice League, Spider-Man), Stephen Sharar, and Sean Seal.\n$4,000 = Everyone at $10 tiers and above will receive a free copy of Up the River #2!\nThe goal of this campaign is to secure the funding necessary to print, ship, and distribute Up the River #1. Any additional funds will go towards marketing Up the River to help spread the word, and towards the printing of issue #2. We\u2019re incredibly excited about what\u2019s been created, and we know people will love it; we just need your help to get it off the ground. :)\nWhile we can't know the exact final costs of everything until we know how many people will go for which rewards, here is a chart showing the approximate breakdown of what the money will go to if we reach the $2,000. \nAs you can see, there's a small sliver in this pie chart set aside for marketing, which is quite necessary to the future success of Up the River. But depending on which rewards people choose over others, it's quite possible that the rewards costs could overtake the money for marketing. This is why additional money made past the point of 2,000 will first go towards marketing, and then hopefully even more can go towards funding issue #2. \n Ready to hear about the rewards? We think you guys will like them, there's some really cool stuff in here! There are 12 different tiers total, including one specifically for retailers who are interested in trying Up the River #1 out in their stores.\nHere it is, your first look at the cover of the comic, penciled by Stephen Sharar, inked by Mark McKenna, colored by Sean Seal!\nThis is the exclusive Kickstarter variant cover!

While Source Point Press is quite indie and on a shoe-string budget, we all believe in this book, and it deserves to be seen. With your help, we can spread the word about Up the River throughout social media, digital platforms, marketing and advertising, and the old-school way: through word of mouth.

If you missed out you can pre-order from www.hackaball.com\nYou can follow our journey on Facebook, Twitter or by joining our newsletter.\nMeet Hackaball\nHackaball is a smart and responsive ball that children can program using an iOS or OS X app to invent and play games.\nIt's for kids aged 6 to 10 but we\u2019ve seen younger children have fun with Hackaball with a little help from their siblings or parents. \nHow does it work?\nThe computer inside Hackaball has sensors that detect motions like being dropped, bounced, kicked, shaken or being perfectly still. Children hack the ball with an iOS or OS X app which allows them to go in and change the behaviour of Hackaball to do what they want. \nThe paired iOS or OS X app comes pre-loaded with several games that can be sent to Hackaball to get kids started. Once they've mastered these initial games, kids can create brand new ones using a simple building block interface, experimenting with Hackaball's sounds, LED lighting effects and rumble patterns. You can install the app on as many iPads an iPhones as you like, it's free! \nPLAY\n\nHackaball grows the more they play. Rewarding kids with unlockable features, challenging them with broken games to fix and the ability to share their creations with friends.\nThe variety of games children make and play are limited only by their imagination. Here\u2019s some games they\u2019ve already made.\nPLAY\n\nHackaball is more than just games\nKids find it easy to create games to play by themselves, in pairs or in groups. But some have been thinking out of the box and found other uses for Hackaball too.\nThey've used Hackaball as props in plays, asked it questions like a magic 8 ball, woken up to it as an alarm clock and even pranked some parents by making it into a whoopie cushion!\nWe're looking forward to see what else they'll create with Hackaball. What do you think your little maker will do?\nWhat you get in the box \nHackaball arrives on your doorstep in our special box with a protective coloured jacket. It comes with our fun setup guide so that kids can put together Hackaball and start playing right away. There\u2019s also a charging cable and a clever smart plug that will work in all regions.\nWhat\u2019s inside Hackaball?\nThe brains of Hackaball is a smart little computer that talks to your iPad or iPhone wirelessly. It\u2019s nervous system is made up of a gyro, accelerometer, vibration motor, 9 LEDs, rechargeable battery, memory to store your sounds and a speaker.\nHow we\u2019ve made a computer you can throw \nWe wanted to make Hackaball tough and beautiful at the same time. We\u2019ve built many prototypes and tested them with the toughest audience - children - to get this right, designing a form that\u2019s robust and tactile but flexible and responsive too. \nThe computer, sensors and displays at the heart of Hackaball sit inside a tough transparent plastic case surrounded by a circular silicone membrane; this acts as a shock absorber, fitting snugly between two translucent rubber hemispheres that snap together around it. \nThere\u2019s a second strong and stretchable outer jacket made from a colourful silicone skin with perforated circles, creating a playful pattern and allowing glowing LED lights to diffuse from the surface beneath it.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nRewards\nBack us now at our special Kickstarter price and your children (nieces and nephews, and other small people) will be amongst the first to get Hackaball. Our pre-order price will be higher. Save money and make some kids happy in time for the holidays, you can't get any better than that! \nStretch goals\nHackaball will come with two coloured jackets! One in aubergine and one in another colour which backers will vote for. Here are some colours we've already created!\nWe\u2019ll also now be making the Hackaball app work on iPad, iPhone and OS X! It's free so you can install it on as many devices as you like!\nYour feedback is really important to us and as you're making Hackaball happen we want you to help us decide. We know you've probably had some great ideas for Hackaball too, so please let us know by emailing us: ideas@hackaball.com\nWhere it began\nHackaball started as an intern project at Made by Many with the simple brief - play! We wanted to give children a new way to understand technology and put them in control.\nTo prove our concept we drew designs, wrote code and soldered circuit boards. We made 7 working Hackaballs and tested it with over a hundred children and parents.\nThe prototypes we made proved kids loved the kind of open play we had envisioned. What we didn't expect, and really blew our minds was how boundless kids' creativity really is. They rose to our challenge for game creation and added drawings, paper cutouts, silly actions and strange rules to create games we could have never ever have imagined. \nParents got behind our idea as it encourages kids to have fun and play more actively with their friends and siblings. And they also love our 'sneaky learning' principle: Hackaball teaches the basics of programming and how technology works without kids even realising it. It's learning through play.\nWith this enthusiasm from both kids and parents we've been working around the clock to make Hackaball into something we're really proud to show you now. We are all excited to have you on board for Hackaball's next mission!\nBe part of our story\nWe're counting on your support to bring Hackaball to life. Reaching our $100,000 goal means we can push the big red launch button!\nBack our project and share our campaign with your friends. Show our videos to your kids and see how excited they get! We want more kids to have fun with Hackaball and we can only do that with your help!\nBe part of our story and we'll have Hackaballs landing on doorsteps in time for the holidays!\nOur growing team\nHackaball inspired a bunch of smart and talented people to join our team. Together we developed Hackaball into something we are now proud to show the world and with your help take to production.\nMade by Many partnered with industrial designers, MAP, to make Hackaball attractive, robust and simple to put together. Karl Sadler created Hackaball\u2019s sounds, giving it an engaging and fun personality. Kudu helped with the electronics, making the magic work on the inside.\nOur promise\nWe believe that toys for kids should be ethical as well as heaps of fun. We promise to never have in-app purchases for Hackaball. We also promise to keep Hackaball's design and language gender neutral to empower kids to personalise the app the way they like.\nWe promise that with your support and ongoing feedback we'll keep on improving. We've got some ideas in the pipeline already but we want you to let us know what we could do with Hackaball. \nWhat if Hackaballs could interact with each other? How about if we worked on other projects like a Hackabat? Imagine how engaging Hackaball would be in a classroom!\nBeing funded won't stop us! Hackaball has so much potential.

So let's add some STRETCH GOALS.\n\\What's It About?\nIn 1801, future President Andrew Jackson woke up on the far side of the galaxy. This lunatic frontier bastard is using every ounce of wit, courage, cunning, and unprovoked violence to make his way home to his beloved wife on Earth. Mixing equal parts Doctor Who and Indiana Jones, Andrew Jackson in Space is a pulp-style sci-fi adventure comic flung across thousands of light years, featuring vagrant queens, amazing artifacts, and a guy bursting into a courtroom brandishing a pistol.\nWhat are we doing?\nAndrew Jackson in Space is a 20-page full-color comic written by Brian Visaggio (Stronghold, \"The Sisters,\" \"The Burning Sun\") and featuring art by Jason Smith (On the Verge) and colors by Harry Saxon (Freak-Out Squares, Torsobear). The book is edited by one-woman tornado Heather Antos (Unlawful Good).\nOriginally devised as a one-off short, Andrew Jackson in Space has developed into a full-length comic; we have a four-issue story-arc in place which we are really excited to get to work on. But before we can do more, we need to get one out the door. The script is finished, and the book is in production as we speak.\nWe're raising $4000 to compensate our talented production team. Each person who pledges over $5 gets at least a digital PDF copy of the book in gratitude for your gift, and the rewards pile up from there.\nHow You Can Help!\nYour participation is really important! Here's a handy pie-chart to show you exactly how your pledge helps make Andrew Jackson in Space happen.\nRewards!\nWe have a great selection of rewards including copies of the book, signed scripts, and tons of original art.

This book is intended to be honest to the character of the real Andrew Jackson as much as it can be; that said, the events in this book are fictional, and the depiction of the character is fictional. It is best to think of this Andrew Jackson as a fictional creation using the real man as a jumping-off point. This book is not in praise of Andrew Jackson. \nI am a great lover of American history, and Jackson is emblematic of his age and of a particular kind of swaggering masculinity that borders on parody. He is a brutal, uncompromising figure; this book recognizes that in the character presented, a young Jackson who has not yet perpetrated his crimes, we have the man who could become that man. That said, please remember contingency. These are events Jackson never encountered historically, and he still has the power to choose his path. Do not think this book assumes a predetermined historical outcome. It does not.\n I am, as always, open to meaningful criticism on these questions, and will endeavor to make sure this book approaches the questions sensitively. Just remember my Jackson will always have the villain in him.\nPress for Andrew Jackson in Space\nPodcasts\nComicosity Hangout - January 19th\nWe Talk Comics Episode 123\nGeeks With Wives Comics Podcast\nInterviews\nGeeked Out Nation - Back This Kickstarter!\nBag & Bored: Interview with Brian Visaggio\nMultiversity - Visaggio and Smith Kickstart \u201cAndrew Jackson in Space\u201d\nComicbook.com - \"This Guy is Such An Angry Mess\"\nA Note on Kickstarter Rewards\nThe $100 script review tier is limited to a single 24-page script with pitch.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have a dedicated creative team in place.

It's important to make our goal because we have another year of campaigning to bring this game to the players. The money pays for our server, going to conventions and game stores, print costs of starter packs and shipping to both domestic and international. While we are confident that a solid amount of this money is possible to be raised with our current community on Facebook and Twitter, the total amount is still a stretch. This is why we choose Kickstarter. It's the name-brand of crowd-funding and its whole purpose is to stretch your potential.\n\nBeyond that, there are smaller challenges that need to be faced and overcome. Chiefly, timing the fulfillment of the rewards to the fulfillment of the payout. The reason this is a challenge is that, in our case everything is handmade and has to be manufactured by a small team of three people. As soon as we know the number of orders we have to fulfill we have to start straight away. It's my hope that we don't make anyone wait for their rewards. The good news is that the system itself is already being built so backers will be immediately able to access their profile.\n\nThe larger challenge after fulfillment is continuously working and polishing the system to the point where its both beautiful and user-friendly. Currently it's in the Beta-test stage and will be when the game launches. This means that the online rule book and the interactivity of the profiles are still being built. As you play we will have updates back-to-back and you will literally get to see the system being built around you. In time the system will be exactly what we envision and hopefully the experience you deserve.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "OMG >_< TSHIRTS ARE FINNALLY DONE!", "update_content": "sigh... So for those of you that aren't on our fb page and don't know, Ive literally been waiting on these damned tshirts for 2 months... Heres the short story and an update, but if you're interested in the details of how crazy this was to force the guy to come through, see below. Also below is the updates for the actual game.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/f6woYhUsOKg\n\nGame Update Details:\n\nPlayer profile is at 95% complete and will be theoretically done sat. GMs profile is next and will be done shortly. More videos to come.\n\nTshirt debacle details: \n\nSo I went to a local guy whom I knew through an old friend to get these shirts done. Last year he did a bundle of shirts right before a convention and turned around and had them to me in a week, so I had no idea this was coming. I payed him over 500$ for all the shirts and ordered two different designs.\n\nWarning sign one: I sent him the .PNG files and he didn't get back with me for a week. I call him a bunch and he never picks up. I finally raise him and he says \"Oh I never got the email\" I double check and the email is right so I just reforward it too him WHILE IM ON THE PHONE to make sure he got it. He gives me a quote and tells me to pay him via paypal, just like last time. I do so.\n\nWarning sign two: I pay the guy and dont hear anything from him for two weeks, but paypal confirms he got the cash. So I call him a bunch and he never picks. I finally raise him a week later and he says \"Oh ya I got the money a week ago [>_<]\" To which I respond, well next time can you call me back so we can pick a date to have them done by* He says ya they will be done by 2 fridays from that call. I confirm. We have a plan.\n\nWarning sign three: I want to preface this one with: Im not an idiot, but at the same rate I HAVE been a giant asshole to people in my life and Ive been trying to curb my punch-you-in-the-mouth behaviour in life because thats no way to be an adult, so Im trying REAL hard not to be angry with him. So anyway, that friday comes and goes and I don't hear from him. Knowing thats his usual MO by now I don't sweart it, I just wait till the last fri giving him the benefit of the doubt. 2nd fri comes and goes and he wont pick up. This takes ANOTHER week to raise him. THIS TIME I call him from my number at work because I know he doesn't have it. \n\nTake a guess what happens next...\n\nHe picks up. So Im pissed now. Hes clearly ducking me, so as politely as I can muster as he has 500+ of YOUR money and hes yet to deliver I say \"Charlie, Im not trying to stress you out, but this money isn't mine and there are 87 people waiting on their KS rewards that I am 6 months behind on. I need those tshirts ASAP\". He replys that he will have them TO MY HOUSE the very next day while Im at work and will drop them off to my wife.\n\nWarning sign four: He never shows, the goods don't arrive and I call him again. No answer. I blow his phone up for a solid week. Im talking like 10 times a day because at this point Im pissed. No answer. I go to his tshirt shop. \n\nGUESS WHAT.\n\nWindows are covered up and the place is locked up during business hours. So as Im sure you can imagin, Im livid. So I get on FB, go to his profile, his like page and his business page and leave a public comment that says \"we had an agreement, youre now more then a month over and you have my money but I don't have the producct. Call me imediately to sort this\". He calls me like 2 mins later. So CLEARLY he knows Im pissed. CLEARLY hes ducking me. So He asks me to take the public post down and I agree on the terms that I get those shirts by fri of that same week. He gives me a sob story about his employees frauding him etc etc. To which I simply reply \"YA BUT YOU DIDNT CALL ME \" So we agree on that fri.\n\nWarning Sign FIVE: As by now you can imagine that fri comes and goes and no shirts appear. I call all day sat and sun, no answer. I finally raise him on Mon by calling through a friends phone and I lay it out for him \"These shirts will be at my door step by midnight tonight or I am going to take you to small claims court. That costs 300$ and when I win, because I have the reciept, the txts, the list of phone calls and the paypal statment, they are going to force you to pay restituion of the 500+ plus the court costs of 300$, then Im going to press charges of grand theft which is a fellonly charge and you WILL see jail time AND THEN Im going to go on a very public smeer campagin over facebook, G+ and Yelp at your businesses expense and Im certain that at least SOME of the 87 backers plus the crowd of 1300+ on fb will join in with me.\"\n\nSo as you can guess, I now have the shirts. But thats not really the point. The point is, I shouldn't have to threaten someone with legal action to get what I rightly paid for. I shouldn't have to bother you with phone calls and feel like the badguy because your so lazy you can't be bothered to pick up the damned phone and confess that your a lazy sack of shit. I shouldn't have to cross my own boundries of not wanting to be an asshole just to get my product and I certainly shouldn't have to feel bad about it.\n\nSo what did I learn from this* Im going to only use a repituable bunsines from now on. Im cutting no breaks for screwups like this guy and Im going to be ready to pull the sword one someone for this kind of crap. I WANT to be nice, but don't mistake kindness for weakness. I will have to be at least a LITTLE bit of an asshole. :/"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #19", "update_userinfo": "Late update BUT BIG update", "update_content": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHWPr0NIJ_E&feature=youtu.be\n\nfor the app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.metagamesinc.zombieapocalypse&hl=en\n\nSo Im going to keep my update short[ish]. Im going to split it into sections:\n\nA) Ummm the tshirt guy took 500+$ and then didn't talk to me for a month. You could imagine how upset I was. However, I had to give the guy the benefit of the doubt, so when I was finally able to catch up to him, what you think would have been a sob story [which wasn't because I had accidently verified it a few days earlier which Ill mention in a sec] was basically: His employee committed a bunch of fraud and when he [said bad employee] was confronted this employee busted up the screen printing hardware... So when you hear that all you can think is \"unlikely, wheres my money\" had it not been for the fact that a few days previous I stopped past his shop. It was closed [weird] and so I crawled up and looked through the only window in the place that wasn't tinited. BOOM broken tshirt press. So then when I hear it from him independantly, I couldn't help but believe the guy. That said, he tells me he is inprint now and we should have them on fri... god I hope Im not an idiot.\n\nB) Functionality! W00t! SO I have the security protocol seperating the free play profiles from the paid [yours] profiles that will have all kinds of goodies. The biggest things worth mentioning are the following:\n\n1) We developed a type of extra modifier that works across your whole character. It was created because, if you were bitten by a zombie and then shot by a surviver, you feel like crap. So if you have 2 HP you don't just HAVE the greatest control over your faclties. So if you're in shock from the gunshot wound, it will be difficult to hold your gun stable. This represents that stat modifier. So what's cool is that if you're down to 2HP, your stats SUCK because of it. God I love this thing.\n\n2) We were puzzling over how to allow the GM profiles simultaneous control over multiple character sheets which up to this point were big. We decided to go with an idea that Mandi Purple [a backer and alpha tester] when we had the Omni Expo test [which went brilliantly because of the updates to that point]. The idea is simple: Perhaps we just close up the information not needed so it doesn't clutter your phone O_O. Why didn't I think of that. So that's what it does now. Not only does it make it easier for the player to use the character sheet but the GMs profile will work FAR better because the information is streamlined.\n\n3) The weapons were separated out of a huge list that made scrolling for days on a phone an issue. The weapons are on one list and the items on another. The items list only break into packs for now, but shortly we will have items that you can pick from to fill slots your pack creates. The weapons list is broken into firearms and Melee, but instead of listing every gun ever created, we decided just to list the ammo. People complain \"wah I don't know what calaber the ammo of my gun has...wah...\" the answer to that is simple: GOOGLE THE AMMO TYPE FOR THE GUN YOU WANT. If you had the gun in real life, you'd have to do it anyway, so that's good enough.

Let me give you the literal list of everything that Ive been working on for the game:\n\nSystem:\n\n1> Free play for four \"base\" characters that were established Alpha test favorites will soon be avaible to play. When I say soon I mean like in the next week soon. You can play those FOR FREE, they come with their own stats. If you prefer to buy a profile in time [which I hope you will - or if youre a backer you already have] you get to keep [or pick if your a backer] one that you can ALSO develope.\n\n2> Backstory literature as written by our main writer David Murrell and edited by me goes live as a file on our facebook group. If you are still not a member our 1000+ person group, you should consider joining us there because not only will you get access to this kind of content, but you can take part in the content-making that goes on in group. Heres a link:  Join us and bring your friends. Story will likely be posted Sat night. \n\n3> The pay system is up but not live yet because we have to get the free play up first to block people from stealing profiles. The characters function in that you can make as many as you want but not in that they don't interact yet. That is a problem we tackle when we go live with the Beta in about a month. For this portion to be finished we just have to finish the firearms caliber chart, get the carry-content and how-many-tools function finished.\n\n4> We have a functioning but alpha online map and tile generator that will you will be able to use to play online. I didn't think I was going to be able to announce that on this KS but our tech guy aparently had an alpha state version built that he suprised me with about 2 weeks ago.\n\nRewards:\n\n1>MINITURES ARE DONE. My god, 1000 zombie minatures is a literal nightmare to print, cut, fold and laminate. There are like 5 steps for every individual zombie BUT they look AWESOME. I also printed 1 NPC per reward so that when you play through the chapter you have the character on hand.\n\n2> still printing and cutting. I have all the Semi Trucks done, and about half of the vehicles, of which there are 5 types done. This isn't nearly as complicated as the zombies but I took the extra step to make them all reversable! That way you can set your game before, during or after the apocalypse. I thought that would be a nice touch for you. Everything is measured to fit and the rules will reflect that as well as they will match EXACTLY the online tile map system that we will introduce in summer as previously mentioned.\n\n3> First round \"Run like Hell\" and second round \"When the zombies come, you die first\" shirts will be back from the printers as soon as the tiles are done. I have a great print guy doing it.\n\n4> Vinyl stickers get cut this weekend. Im including the main logo and a round logo in them.\n\nSocial:\n\n1> Im doing the english edit for Urban Heros RPG."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #11", "update_userinfo": "HEY GUYS BIG UPDATE!", "update_content": "Hey sorry Ive been not updating lately...

[*New readers do not need be familiar with KALI-YUGA in order to begin reading TRETA-YUGA.*]\n\nTRETA is sponsored by Graham Hancock (Fingerprints of the Gods, War God), and Jeffrey Kripal (Mutants & Mystics: Science Fiction, Superhero Comics, and the Paranormal).\nXven in the thralls of glitch trance\nArkana entranced in forest visions\nSTORY\nXven and Arkana are the last lore hunters in the desolate realm of Vekt. Lore hunting has become a near extinct profession known only by pirates and immortals. Together, they seek the silver scroll, known to contain the secrets to glitch magic and said to be coveted by Qigong Master Zee.\nIt was said that Xven would learn of glitch mastery with the appeaence of the astral spider, as it weaved the web delicately through the Towers of Ouoranth...\nXven falling after searing a planet with glitch arts\n  TRETA-YUGA, YUGAVERSE, and all content \u00a9 2014 Benton Rooks\nXven close up concept art\nBut Master Zee's faithful adepts may only learn to know of the infamous document through the transmission of the Shadow Tiger stance, a rare Qigong form which allows a proper gateway into Innerspace itself.\nTRETA-YUGA is an innovative, action packed, science-fantasy graphic novel that utilizes digital lighting techniques to achieve a cinematic, photo-realistic aesthetic. It is inspired by Eastern mythology, the Wuxia genre, JRPG's, anime, and game/film concept art.\n\nInterviews/Press/Links\n\nA video interview I did with legendary UK author Graham Hancock received quite a lot of attention.\nCheck out an in depth interview on inspiration and background for the YUGAVERSE here.\n\nTake a listen to a podcast I did with indie Kickstarter Comic masters The Wombmates here.\n\nMy article Japanese Media, Psychedelic Yokai, and Graphic Novels traces some of the Eastern lore that has inspired TRETA-YUGA.\n\nRead the Sequart review of the previous Kickstarter success KALI-YUGA by David Whittaker here.\nReaders should also know that due to some truly awesome friends and fans, some of my previous articles at Reality Sandwich have received over 8,000+ shares.\n\nThis project will be tweeted to over 8,000 followers on my own Twitter accounts @bentonrooks, @KaliYugaComic and on Facebook.\n\nYour support will be shared to a global fan base and will be appreciated widely!\nDetails\n\nThe \"rules\" of this graphic novel are: no speech bubbles, no sound effect text, and each image will conform (with a few exceptions) to the widescreen cinematic format. I love traditional 2D comic art, but I thought it'd be fun and challenging to try a \"film on paper\" approach.\nDimensions of the final product in printed form will be horizontal in format rather than the standard vertical comic, similar to the concept art book for Dune (as seen in Jodorowsky's Dune documentary.)\nCritical acclaim for the YUGAVERSE:\n\n\"With the creation of the YUGAVERSE, Benton Rooks has created something that is gorgeous to behold on the visual level, while also being distinctly forward thinking in experimental aesthetics. This epic story is a must read for fans of fantasy and sci-fi alike. \u2014Graham Hancock, bestselling author of Fingerprints of the Gods, and the War God trilogy \n\"This is exactly what needs to happen. Really smart authors and artists with visions need to engage the technical scholarship on the gnostic, esoteric, and mystical in order to help create a new emergent mythology, a new world, a new planetary future. It comes as no surprise that Benton Rooks is engaging in this magic ritual of the YUGAVERSE in the only public space where it is now allowed: in the secret gnosis of popular culture.\" \u2014Jeffrey J. Kripal, author of Mutants and Mystics: Science Fiction, Superhero Comics, and the Paranormal\n\n\"Benton's fresh anti-Gandalf take on the wizard archetype merges sci-fi and fantasy themes for an action packed, psychedelic romp through dark, interdimensional reptile lairs.

I'm asking the backers. :-D\n***\n\"an awesome, sassy vampire webcomic...with unique and fresh ideas\"\n-- Meg Markey, ReadComicBooks.net\n\"shows surprising depth quickly\"\n-- Chuck Wendig, author of the Miriam Black books and the Heartland series\nIt\u2019s that time! After Daylight, your one-stop shop for satirical vampire comedy/drama with a splash of socially-aware snark (okay, maybe more than a splash) has been updating faithfully as a weekly webcomic since August of 2012. Now 100 hand-shaded pages are in the can, the grand plot arc of the first \u201cseason\u201d is all wrapped up, and it\u2019s time for it to sail out into the world in gorgeous print.\nGreat. So what\u2019s After Daylight?\nWell, you gotta understand. I\u2019ve been writing vampire fiction on a professional basis since the late 90\u2019s, and I still love the bloodthirsty little dears to death, but I can only take them so seriously anymore. As an author, I love the juiciness of a setting where humans must share the planet (or not) with other sentient, powerful beings. Who drink blood. But as a fan, I\u2019ve gotten so tired of books and shows that drop all these intriguing hints about how that setting would work\u2026aaaand then end up way too busy destroying the protagonists\u2019 romance for the fourth time to really follow up on it. Not naming any names.\nSo I\u2019ve taken that premise of \"humans discover vampires! En masse!\" and put my own tongue-mostly-in-cheek twist on it. And I\u2019ve written in all those bloodsuckers I knew had to exist if there really were bloodsuckers, but for some reason we never see them. You know: the ones too busy working a crappy night job to stand around with perfect hair, moping existentially. The ones who think blood bank discards taste like rusty nails. The ones who listen to a little too much talk radio. The ones who actually reflect the incredible variety of a modern urban population. The ones who\u2019re more scared of mortals than the mortals are of them.\nWe see much of this through the eyes of one \"Cat\" Bernstein, ex-folk-rocker turned undead retail drudge, but this series is all about strong ensemble cast. No matter what kind of vamps you like, I've probably got one for you! Volume 1 takes us through the ominous creeping dawn of Daylight -- that's the vampires' unhappy nickname for this revelation -- from its first deniable Internet leaks (and the inevitable LOLmacros) to the full monty of the inescapable spotlight.\nLet\u2019s just say, hijinks ensue. But don\u2019t take my word for it. Feel free to browse over to the webcomic at http://www.afterdaylight.com and take a look!\nOkay, but why should I back this if the webcomic is free?\nGlad you asked.\nReason #1: The book is way cooler. It\u2019s bigger and much higher-resolution, so even if you\u2019re reading the PDF, you\u2019ll enjoy a nicer view of the lovingly-detailed art and all the jokey little Easter eggs. The print edition will be even lovelier, what with its hip, graphic, UV-spot-coated cover design and all. Both print and PDF versions will have some material not available on the website \u2013 with possibly even more bonus goodies, if we can hit stretch goals! Finally, while After Daylight works fine as a page-a-week fix because of the comedy, it also has a continuing dramatic plot that's more satisfying to read in extended bursts. The book/e-book format makes those leisurely reading sessions much more convenient and pleasurable.\nReason #2: Creators gotta eat. We live in exciting times. Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter are opening up whole new possibilities for indie comics. Webcomics in particular have eagerly added it to the business model that\u2019s been emerging over the last decade or so \u2013 a model in which you can make it even if your stories are too wild and weird, too niche, too unconventional in art style, or too \u201chard to market\u201d to sell to risk-averse major publishers. I\u2019ve spent the last two years basically doing my \u201cante up\u201d \u2013 proving to myself that I can meet a regular deadline while creating a story and characters that make people laugh, think, and care. I believe the reader response so far has borne this out. But a comic like this is time- and labor-intensive to produce, and rent still comes annoyingly due every month. So now I have to verify that I can make at least enough money at this to be able to continue with the series. Your pledge money is funding an honest-to-goodness professional offset print run, but this is an all-or-nothing deal. If the funding goal isn't met by the deadline, no money changes hands and that means I can't buy the run, so I need the help of each and every one of you with pledging and spreading the word.\nBut if we succeed, I can print enough premium-quality books not only to reward my backers, but also to sell on an ongoing basis at conventions, through small retailers, and on the Internet. In other words, your Kickstarter support can help make my indie creative career viable in a way that simply wouldn\u2019t have been possible twenty years ago. As a child of the pre-Web era, I find this change amazing! I hope you do too.\nAll right, you've sold me. Now tell me what goodies I get!\nGlad you asked that, too!\nI have many pledge levels for you -- take a look on the right. In all likelihood, there's one that suits your desires and budget.

They've done absolutely beautiful work on several of my colleagues' books and I'm eager to see what they can do with AD!)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n+ The 100 full comic pages and 5 minicomics that make up Volume 1 are already completed, so apart from layout -- which is currently in progress -- the book is finished. This has already been a multi-year labor, which I'm very proud and happy to have invested in.\n\n+ There can be no collaboration problems because After Daylight is a one-woman shop. My boss may be a taskmaster, but she can't fire me! Yes, if I get run over by a truck or something, then no further volumes will be created -- and while the first big plot arc is finished in Vol. 1, I plan many more wicked plot arcs that do need me to keep making them. So I hope you'll join me in my fervent desire that no trucks engage me in any right-of-way disputes.\n\n+ This is a first Kickstarter. I've crunched oh, so many spreadsheet numbers and lined up multiple potential vendors for this, but it's still always possible that something will happen to cause a production delay beyond those already anticipated (for instance, my most likely print vendor ships from overseas, so that multi-week delay is all but certain). I'll be very clear about what I expect for turnaround times on each reward category once the funding goal is reached and fulfillment begins. If it looks like there'll be a hiccup, delay, or need to switch vendors, I'll keep everyone apprised of those developments as they happen and listen carefully to backer feedback.\n\n+ In planning this campaign, I'm lucky to follow a path already trodden by similar bound-volume projects that have funded successfully, and whose fulfillment phases were much like what I'm planning. Their triumphs and agonies have been my teachers. I've been soliciting advice from multiple colleagues for many months now, and as a result, I believe I've built in reasonable cushions and contingencies for the known problems of crowdfunding a graphic novel. (For instance, NOT forgetting shipping expenses and fees!) Again, however, if something unanticipated comes up that has the potential to affect my backers, frequent and informative updates will be my response.\n\n+ If I have my way, After Daylight will be around for many years to come -- so my long-term relationship with my readers is one of the most important things in the world to me. In all I do with this campaign, the desire to keep that relationship going strong is my guide.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #81", "update_userinfo": "Comedy in an age of self-parody?", "update_content": "So yeah, that all happened.\n\nI mean, in a way, my conscience is clear?

The festival, taking place on Saturday (6/7) and Sunday (6/8), will feature a book fair with 120-150 exhibitors and cross-disciplinary panels. New South will celebrate independent literature, alternative comics, small presses, and print culture. It will be highly curated, focused, fresh, and irreverent. \nNew South Logo by New York Times Bestselling Cartoonist Box Brown\nSince Foxing's inception, I have been fortunate enough to meet and collaborate with some very talented literary entities here in town, all of which have become good friends. American Short Fiction, A Strange Object, Austin Review and Write Bloody will have a hand in organizing this event alongside Foxing. Together, we'll work hard to make this festival a reality.\nAdditionally, your support will help us launch new year-round literary and comic programs under the New South umbrella. We see this as an opportunity to explore new methods of encouraging literacy and comic arts within our community. \nWe can only do this with your support. Please help us get started. Join us in launching New South\u2019s first year!\nThanks so much,\nDanithan\nEditor & Founder | Foxing Quarterly\nOur team  consists of several figureheads from the eclectic variety of lit journals and publishers in Austin.* Our collective mission is to support the literary arts at the local level and to bring publishers, writers, cartoonists, artists and readers into conversation. There is a very strong, budding literary scene happening right now in our city. We would love to encourage its growth. Together, we believe we can establish a very unique and exciting literary event in Austin. \nDanithan (Foxing Quarterly), Director\nJill Meyers (A Strange Object), Literary Director\nShannon McCormick, Programming Coordinator (Comics)\nAdeena Reitberger (American Short Fiction), Programing Coordinator (Lit)\nRebecca Markovitz (American Short Fiction), Programing Coordinator (Lit)\nDerrick Brown (Write Bloody), Master of Ceremonies\n*We are all working on this event for free. No money from this campaign will go into organizer payroll. \nThe French Legation Museum is a beautiful outdoor venue in East Austin. It is primarily used for weddings, but is also home to the very popular annual film series, Cinema East. \nThe space caps at 2,000 people. It is a perfect setting for a large-scale summer event. It has 3 large lawns (for exhibitors), 1 smaller lawn (for hourly panels), electrical outlets throughout, driveway for food trucks (very important), and a small loft above the museum office (green room for exhibitors and special guests).\nIt's important for us to keep this festival FREE & OPEN TO THE PUBLIC. This will help us encourage the growth of our local scene. And, as a frequent exhibitor at various festivals, I know the added pressure of costly table rates. By keeping TABLE FEES CHEAP for exhibitors, we'll buffer exhibitors' travel expenses and increase their profit margin at New South. \nFurthermore, we plan to establish ourselves as a 501(c)3 Nonprofit organization. A small chunk of money received will go towards making this happen. There are certain benefits attached to 501(c)3 status: tax exemption, ability to accept tax-deductible donations, legitimacy of IRS recognition, and access to a wider selection of grants for further funding. This will help us continue to grow community outreach projects in our city.\nTables & Chairs - $2,500 (Estimated for 120-150 Exhibitors) \nSignage and Advertisement - $2,000\nTents - $1,350\nDelivery/Setup fees- $290\nA/V - $250\nSecurity (Required at the space) - $400\nNonprofit Startup Fee - $850\nKickstarter Rewards & Shipping - $1,800 (estimated)\nKickstarter Fees - $2,000 \nVenue - $5,500\nTOTAL - $16,940\nThe remaining amount will help with any unexpected fees/emergency costs and, if this inaugural fest is successful, contribute to building New South's 2016 year. \nWith the help of many of our amazing friends, we have curated a wonderful cache of incentives for helping us fund this campaign. \nRewards include: original art, zines, lit journals, exhibitor space at the event, advertising opportunities, posters, apparel, stickers, buttons, and more!\nFoxing & Friends Event for AWP 2014 (Illustration by Leigh Luna)\nBack in February, New South's organizers hosted a Post-it art show & reading at the Fantagraphics Bookstore & Gallery in Seattle, Washington.

I'll write and draw 8 pages in 8 consecutive hours. I'll update this project as I go, and when it's all done, I'll make a mini-comic of it. Want one? Just back this project!\nWhat will this comic be about? I don't know yet. This is an improvisational experiment; a smaller, less exhausting version of the 24-Hour Comic. Want to influence the comic?

One thing \u2014 to do this, you'll have to pledge for that art early, before I've, you know, drawn it.\nFor a sense of what this comic will be like, you can read some of my other comics, lots of which are online for free. Here, try these:\nThe Black Well \u2014 a graphic novel\nThe Retreat \u2014 an odd short story\nThere Once Was A Girl \u2014 a sort of fairytale-ish thing\nAlso, here are a few random panels from a mini-comic I made last year called We Were Like Ghosts:\nWhat do you think?

It seems like a fairytale life, but no matter how hard Raith tries to deny fate, the sickness that weakens his body, the secrets that haunt his dreams, and the ancient magic that tears at his soul all converge to force him toward a dark destiny tainted by regret, madness, pain, and worse...\nAside from Raith, Book One centers on a motley group of characters -- Loach, a surly, cowardly treasure hunter -- Winter and Wade, two companions on a mission from the mainland -- young Dawn and her guardian, Fox -- and the man who hunts them all, the twisted and cruel Bors and his bloodthirsty Pack.\nBack in the old days (ok, so it was 2012... but hey, Kickstarter has grown by a factor of ten bazillion since then), anyhow, back then I ran a campaign to raise funds for another graphic novel series, 13 Legends. It was a very positive experience, and the whole team was blown away by the warm reception the final book received.\nAnd now I'd like to do that for Murder & Midnight.\nWe want to print the highest quality hardbound book possible, and if we're fortunate enough to exceed our goal, that money will go two places:\nFirst and foremost, the more cash we raise, the more we can upgrade the specs of the book.

With a MFA in Screenwriting, Jon has written numerous film and graphic novel scripts, and also freelances as a story consultant and narrative writer.\nDavid Ward is the extraordinary artist who breathes life into the characters and world of Murder & Midnight -- constantly amazing his teammates at how excellently he conveys the emotions of the characters and captures key moments of action.\nKelly Eastman is a marketing director by day and letterer & graphic designer by... well, also by day... who makes the Murder & Midnight website an object of beauty and, as letterer, endeavors to seamlessly link the dialogue and sounds from Jon's scripts to David's artwork -- an essential component of the storytelling.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOf course there are always risks, but I feel that the experience from my previous Kickstarter -- where I had a high quality hardback book successfully printed and shipped -- has given me a good idea of what to expect in this campaign.

Faced with a new century and new steam technology, the social and political status quo is turned on its head. People are uncomfortable with change and, in fact, many people fear it. That fear and the violence which follows causes a psychic rift to puncture the veil of space and time allowing the entity known as \"The Shifter\" to escape. Feeding on the resentment and fear between the rich and poor, \u201cThe Shifter\u201d triggers a rash of murders.

Known only as B.E.T.H., they are:\nTHEY FAIL.\nAgainst their better judgment, they look to a man driven by revenge \u2013 SAMUEL HUNTER.\n For the one mistake The Shifter made was killing Samuel\u2019s wife.

His work has also appeared in FUBAR, the NYT bestselling anthology series.\nCOVER ART FOR CHAPTER 4\nWHAT OTHER PEOPLE SAY ABOUT BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY:\n\u201cBoston Metaphysical is one of my favorite webcomics not just because I'm a sucker for any comics that feature Harry Houdini in lead roles (though I am) or because I love comics that use ghosts in different ways than most strips do (though I am). No, Boston Metaphysical is one of my favorite webcomics because Madeleine Holly-Rosing creates a wonderful fictional world with bold characters and thoroughly entertaining plots. And because of Houdini and the ghosts. I like ghosts.\u201d-Jason Sacks, Publisher, Comics Bulletin www.comicsbulletin.com\n\"With over <cough, cough> years in the comic business as a writer, editor, artist and a publisher, I\u2019ve worked with many new and established talented writers and artists.  Madeleine Holly-Rosing and Emily Hu are the real deal. It\u2019s hard to believe that BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY is their first comic book series.  With its spot on writing and elegant illustrations it's got something that crosses over genres and refuses to be pigeon-holed. We'll see more of this dynamic duo. Back this Kickstarter with me and you'll be able to boast you knew them when as well.\"  \u2013 Dave Elliott, A1/Atomeka Press\n\"The Boston Metaphysical Society has more diversity in a story set over 100 years ago in Boston then most modern day stories in New York City do, that alone should let you know this series is different in a great way. If the idea of Tesla, monsters made of magnets, or spirit photographers intrigue you, you should be supporting this series.\" - Dr. Alexander Bustos, Comic Attack\n\"As a huge fan of steampunk, I was very happy to be introduced to the webcomic BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY. Ms. Holly-Rosing nails the tone with her expert writing and her artist, Ms. Hu, is a wonder.  I definitely want to see how this story ends and will be backing this Kickstarter.

Detailing the adventures of its titular character in The Land of Wonderful Dreams, McCay's early twentieth century opus is one of the most inventive and visually stunning works of American art. A century later, the comic medium is still racing to keep up with the richness, draftsmanship, imagination, and wonder of McCay's fantastic storytelling and wild Slumberland universe.  \nWinsor McCay, 1908\nLocust Moon Press has spent the last two years assembling the LITTLE NEMO: DREAM ANOTHER DREAM anthology, in which many of the world's finest cartoonists will pay tribute to the master and his masterpiece by creating new Little Nemo strips, following their own voices down paths lit by McCay. Taking on the same giant, broadsheet newspaper-sized canvas as McCay, artists such as Michael Allred, Paul Pope, Yuko Shimizu, J.H. Williams III, Charles Vess, David Mack, J.G. Jones, Craig Thompson, Paolo Rivera, Carla Speed McNeil, Bill Sienkiewicz, P. Craig Russell, Ronald Wimberly, Denis Kitchen, Jill Thompson, Stephen R. Bissette, Gabriel B\u00e1 & F\u00e1bio Moon, Farel Dalrymple, John Cassaday, Cliff Chiang, and over a hundred more have all done some of the very best work of their illustrious careers. [See below for the full creator list.] \nNow this collection of beautiful new strips is 100% done on our end -- all that's left is to print it, and that's where we need your help. Taking inspiration from Sunday Press's perfect series of reprints, we have designed DREAM ANOTHER DREAM to be printed at Little Nemo in Slumberland's original broadsheet newspaper size, as a massive 16\" x 21\", 144-page hardcover designed by Jim Rugg.\nCover, Little Nemo: Dream Another Dream\nIn the making of this book, we have discovered a community of McCay's admirers, of incredibly talented cartoonists and illustrators who want to honor the giant on whose shoulders they sit. Even beyond seeing the artwork itself, one of the true pleasures of putting this project together is being a part of this literal and figurative dream team, being surrounded by one hundred-some passionate artists who love McCay and Little Nemo. This Kickstarter is an extension of that \u2013 we hope that you'll jump on board this glory-bound train, and become a part of the informal family devoted to bringing this once-in-a-lifetime project to fruition. \nRoger Langridge / Jeremy Bastian\nWe could think of no better way to produce this unique, daunting tome exactly the way it deserved to be made than to do it ourselves, with help from like-minded, passionate fans of McCay and all those who appreciate the best of comics art. It has been endlessly fascinating to see how each and every artist involved has internalized different aspects of McCay's work, integrating his influence into their own styles in such wildly different -- and often surprising -- ways. We know that those of you who haven't heard of McCay until now will find a lot to love in these pages, and we only hope it's enough to inspire you to look back at those old Sunday strips yourself.\nPeter & Maria Hoey / Peter Bagge\nLITTLE NEMO: DREAM ANOTHER DREAM will celebrate McCay's endless legacy, chart his influence on generations of modern cartoonists, and most of all shine a light back on an artist who has given his art form so much, and whose work should be more widely known. This is a love song for Winsor McCay, Little Nemo, and the limitless possibilities of comics.\nDavid Petersen / Toby Cypress\nTHE CREATORS\nClick any clickable name for a preview of that creator's strip!\nPaul Allor\nMichael & Laura Allred \nWeshoyot Alvitre \nConnie Appletree \nGabriel B\u00e1 \nPeter Bagge \nFil Barlow \nJeremy Bastian \nJeremy Baum \nArt Baxter \nAlexandra Beguez \nGregory Benton \nStephen R.

Here's what's been unlocked for new and existing backers now that we've hit our STRETCH GOAL:\nTHE REWARDS\nAside from a beautiful, 16\" x 21\" hardcover book, we have a few other pieces lined up to enjoy, all exclusive to this Kickstarter campaign. From digital making-of specials to original art. \nLOCUST MOON\nLocust Moon is a retail store, art gallery, and small press based in West Philadelphia. Their first book, ONCE UPON A TIME MACHINE (published through Dark Horse in the fall of 2012) was nominated in the Harveys and Stumptown Comic Arts Awards for Best Anthology. Locust Moon's comic projects since have included the periodical comics & illustration magazine QUARTER MOON (thank Kickstarter for issue #2), and 36 LESSONS IN SELF-DESTRUCTION, a collection of the mini comics of infamous underground Philadelphia cartoonist Rob Woods. Locust Moon also hosts an annual comics festival, next held on October 25, 2014.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are a lot of risks and challenges associated with printing and distributing a book of this size and ambition, but with your help and support we feel ready and eager to face them. We have one successful Kickstarter campaign under our belts already, fully funded with all rewards fulfilled, so we're not going into this blind. We've carefully priced out expenses for domestic and overseas shipping as well as printing costs for all books and prints, and arranged for the logistics of reward fulfillment including signatures from artists who live all over the country. We have a good plan in place, and we're ready for the kind of surprises that are sure to come our way. \n\nOne particular difficulty we face here is the fact that we've decided not to make a PDF edition of the book available for purchase or as a reward. These strips were all designed to be seen on the huge broadsheet 16\" x 21\" canvas that McCay used, and we feel presenting the lot of them for viewing on tablets and screens would do an injustice to this remarkable work. Our edition will be a beautifully crafted art object, and we have no desire to reproduce its contents in a smaller format. We know this makes it more difficult to raise money from a wider audience looking for lower end digital rewards -- but we're counting on folks to see this once-in-a-lifetime book for what it is and be willing to spend a little more to underwrite the incredibly high production values and aesthetic quality contained within.\n\nOur biggest challenge is the simple fact that we have to raise so much money to cover printing. We're doing everything in our power to spread the word, but ultimately, we need your help. The comics world is one of passionate dreamers, filled with brilliant and articulate people who love this medium and want to see it celebrated and explored.

What started as a small group of local friends wanting to do some comic projects together quickly ballooned into a group approaching 30 collaborators and a number of locally-owned comic shops. By partnering with brick and mortar retail comic stores we strive to be a pipeline for Michigan creators to see their work on the shelves of their local comic book store and to have fans in the state enjoy their high-quality, home-grown entertainment.\nOur First Collaboration\nThe group soon decided that the best way to move forward was by creating a comic anthology giving Michigan comic lovers and beyond a taste of what MCC has to offer. After taking submissions and forming effective art teams, the 110+ page anthology is nearly complete and ready for our Michigan-based printer to produce the initial print run of 350 copies.\nOur Goal\nProviding we reach our $4,000 goal, our finances will break down thusly:\nPrinting costs:  $3,200 (350 full color copies, plus various prints for rewards)\nAmazon/Kickstarter fees:  $400\nEstimated Shipping Costs for rewards:  $400\nPublicity and Marketing the Anthology\nAfter printing, a huge signing event with all the MCC creators will take place at Coy's Comics in Saginaw, Michigan with all the pomp and circumstance we can muster.  A handful of copies are earmarked to go to the shelves of the other stores in Michigan that have partnered with us to help the project see the light of day.\nThe MCC Collaborators\nSean Seal - Travis McIntire - Andrew Iwamasa - Frankie Lang - Stephen Sharar - Zakk Saam - David Andres - Jason Jimenez - Brad Gischia - Tim Kenyon - Patrick Cline - Jeffrey Phillips - Joshua Werner - Jolyn Ohlendorf - Joe Freyre - Josh Sobek - Jason Lloyd  - Michael Wren - Heather Antos - Patrick Humphreys - Candra Stark -BJ Duvall - Greg Wright, Rob Garcia and MORE! \nSamples\nJohn Vs.

Comic publishers produced dozens of titles throughout the 1950s and 60s, and many of the medium\u2019s top artistic talents worked in romance comics. For a number of reasons, romance comics all but died out.\nWe think it is about time for a revival. We thought we'd breathe some new life into romance comics by mixing in some science fiction!\nThe artists we chose for this anthology proved that we were right. The work that they created is alive, vital, and unlike anything you've seen before.\nTHE BOOK\nWe think comics are best enjoyed in book form. We would like to deliver a high quality printed book, showcasing the beautiful comics of each contributor. This book will be 6\u201dx9\u201d, perfect bound, offset printed, 80 pages, black and white, with a color cover.\nTHE ARTISTS \nWe have a collection of exciting independent artists that we know you will love. We see this as a chance for you to discover some new talent and see what the future of comics has in store.\nMike Manomivibul \nMike is the amazing cover artist for Speculative Relationships!

One challenge is that we would never want to rush the artists and force work that is uninspired.

Getting proofs of the book and making it look JUST RIGHT for our backers is very important, so that process could possibly take longer than expected. However, we plan to work our hardest to minimize any delays. \n\nAlthough shipping is always a challenge, we are confident we can divide and conquer (For example - utilizing Scott's children as child labor) to get the project delivered to our backers by the goal date.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #30", "update_userinfo": "ERIS #1 coming to Kickstarter!", "update_content": "Hello Speculative Relationships backers!\nI'm happy to announce my new project ERIS #1 will be available on Kickstarter starting Wednesday, 5/20, at 9:00am CST."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "New Project from Tyrell Cannon!

The third chapter is 28 pages and the fourth chapter is 24 pages.\nCover of Issue 3\nThe year is 1895...An evil from a parallel dimension escaped and now roams the city of Boston.\nFaced with a new century and new steam technology, the social and political status quo is turned on its head. People are uncomfortable with change and, in fact, many people fear it. That fear and the violence which follows causes a psychic rift to puncture the veil of space and time allowing the entity known as \"The Shifter\" to escape. Feeding on the resentment and fear between the rich and poor, \u201cThe Shifter\u201d triggers a rash of murders.\nFour of the greatest minds of the time have banded together to try and stop this malevolent entity. Known only as B.E.T.H., they are:\nTHEY FAIL. Against their better judgment, they look to a man driven by revenge \u2013 SAMUEL HUNTER. \nFor the one mistake The Shifter made was killing Samuel\u2019s wife. An ex-Pinkerton detective, Samuel gathers his unlikely team of\u2026 Caitlin O'Sullivan, Medium and Spirit Photographer\nand Granville Woods, Scientist Extraordinaire.\nThey are the Boston Metaphysical Society.\nTheir job: Stop The Shifter before Boston tears itself apart.\nCOVER ART ISSUE 1\n COVER ART ISSUE 2\nBOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY is written by Madeleine Holly-Rosing and drawn by Emily Hu.\nThe third chapter is ready to go to the printer, so there will be no huge lag time before you receive the book. Also, the 4th Chapter has been sent off to Emily for her to start on. So we are moving forward!\nWhere the money goes: Your backing would enable us to print enough copies of chapter three to send off to backers with some leftover to sell at conventions along with incentives, shipping (which includes mailing envelopes/tubes, postage and handling.) And, of course, the Amazon fees (5% off the top, plus credit card fees.) The third chapter will be 28 pages long which includes chapter three plus six pages of extras.\nINCENTIVES:\nOur incentives not only include the pdf and print version of Chapter 3, but also B.E.T.H. bookmarks, short stories, A BRAND NEW BMS NOVELLA, posters, a BMS Owl Lapel Pin, and fan art in the pdf version which (depending on the package you pick) will include fan art from LUNARBABOON,\nCALVIN GARCIA,\n and many others.\nOWL LAPEL PIN (Die Cast Antique Brass - 1 inch in diameter) The pin was designed by my dear friend, Bill Meahan! A retired engineer, he is now an ardent fan of the comic and a huge help to me.

Madeleine Holly-Rosing and Emily Hu are the real deal. It\u2019s hard to believe that BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY is their first comic book series. With its spot on writing and elegant illustrations it's got something that crosses over genres and refuses to be pigeon-holed. We'll see more of this dynamic duo. Back this Kickstarter with me and you'll be able to boast you knew them when as well.\" \u2013 Dave Elliott, A1/Atomeka Press\n\"As a huge fan of steampunk, I was very happy to be introduced to the webcomic BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY. Ms. Holly-Rosing nails the tone with her expert writing and her artist, Ms. Hu, is a wonder. I definitely want to see how this story ends and will be backing this Kickstarter. (As you should too.)\" - Bryn Pryor (Writer/Director, Cowboys and Engines)\n\u201cBoston Metaphysical took the scientific and engineering greats of the Victorian era and mixed them with ghost hunters. It\u2019s history and mystery blended into a fascinating story that can't be put down!\" - Travis Sivart (Host of Sounds of Steam, a Steampunk radio show)\n\u201cBoston Metaphysical is one of my favorite webcomics not just because I'm a sucker for any comics that feature Harry Houdini in lead roles (though I am) or because I love comics that use ghosts in different ways than most strips do (though I am). No, Boston Metaphysical is one of my favorite webcomics because Madeleine Holly-Rosing creates a wonderful fictional world with bold characters and thoroughly entertaining plots. And because of Houdini and the ghosts. I like ghosts.\u201d-Jason Sacks, Publisher, Comics Bulletin www.comicsbulletin.com\n\"The Boston Metaphysical Society has more diversity in a story set over 100 years ago in Boston then most modern day stories in New York City do, that alone should let you know this series is different in a great way. If the idea of Tesla, monsters made of magnets, or spirit photographers intrigue you, you should be supporting this series.\" - Dr. Alexander Bustos, Comic Attack\nSTRETCH GOALS: \nSTRETCH GOAL #1: $3,500 - REACHED!\nA minimum of three (3) (3\" x 3\") Boston Metaphysical Society Stickers to everyone who has pledged the Granville Woods Package \u201cA\u201d or above. The sticker was also designed by Bill Meahan.\nSTRETCH GOAL #2: $4,150 - REACHED!\nA pencil and inked portrait of either Samuel, Caitlin, Granville or Tesla drawn by Emily Hu. (8.5 x 11, 10 pt. card stock glossy) After completion of the campaign all backers will vote on which one Emily will draw. This portrait poster will go to everyone who has pledged the Granville Woods \u201cA\u201d package or above.\nSTRETCH GOAL #3: $5,400 - REACHED!!!\nPrint Chapter 4!!

This stretch goal is available to anyone who has pledged $20 or more including the Nothing But Books Package AND EVERYONE WHO HAS PLEDGED $5.00 OR MORE receives a pdf of Chapter 4. Emily is currently working on chapter four so the earliest it will be available is in May.\nI know this is a big goal, but this issue will be mailed separately from the third chapter so we had to add a little more to cover the extra postage. If we make this goal and you are willing to wait until May to receive all of your mailed rewards (other books, stickers, bookmark including Chapter 4) please let us know and you will save us a little money and have our undying gratitude. (Posters/lockets/lapel pins will be mailed as scheduled.) Any money saved will go directly to production of Chapters 5 and 6. If we do not hear from you, we will assume you want it separately.\nSTRETCH GOAL #4: $5,950\nIt has been such a tight race between Caitlin and Tesla for the pencil/ink portrait poster, we decided Emily will draw whoever takes second place. This will be a 8.5 x 11 portrait on 10 pt. card stock glossy.\nSTRETCH GOALS #5: LOCKED", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe learned a lot from our last Kickstarter so my husband and I decided that we would fund the art production for the rest of the issues in the six issue mini-series and use Kickstarter as a way for backers to pre-order each issue as they become available.

Also a BIG THANK YOU to Scott Baker (4scottbaker@gmail.com) for making this video.\nBoston Metaphysical Society needs your help to finish the last three issues in the mini-series and print all six into a softbound book.\nThe year is 1895...An evil from a parallel dimension escaped and now roams the city of Boston. The world has developed along the lines of Steampunk technology. Here exists steam driven rudimentary computers and electronics. And dirigibles rule the sky.\nBut with it comes social and political upheaval as not everyone is comfortable with change. In fact, many people fear it. That fear and the violence that followed caused a psychic rift to puncture the veil of space and time allowing the entity known as \"The Shifter\" to escape. Feeding on the resentment and fear between the rich and poor, \u201cThe Shifter\u201d triggers a rash of murders.\nFour of the greatest minds of the time have banded together to try and stop this malevolent entity.\nAlexander Graham Bell \nThomas Edison \n  Nikola Tesla \n  Harry Houdini \n  THEY FAIL.\nAgainst their better judgment, they look to a man driven by revenge \u2013 SAMUEL HUNTER. \n For the one mistake The Shifter made was killing Samuel\u2019s wife. An ex-Pinkerton detective, Samuel gathers his unlikely team of\u2026\nCaitlin O'Sullivan, Medium and Spirit Photographer \nand Granville Woods, Scientist Extraordinaire. \nThey are the Boston Metaphysical Society.\nTheir job: Stop The Shifter before Boston tears itself apart.\nThe Story Behind The Story\nBOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY began as a TV Pilot which I wrote while I was in the MFA Program in Screenwriting at UCLA. Everyone told me it would make a great comic so I adapted the original story into a six issue mini-series. After that I went looking for an artist. Many months later, I met Emily Hu through a mutual friend and a partnership was born. Her passion for the project matched my own, so I knew the story was in good hands. I launched BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY as a webcomic in May of 2012. The first two chapters are up and the third has just debuted.\nHowever by wading into the deep end of the pool, I discovered a terrible truth \u2013 I love writing comics.\nSo here I am with three chapters done and three more to go. That\u2019s when I realized another terrible truth \u2013 making comics is expensive. \nMy husband and I believe in this project so much that we have spent our own money completing the first three chapters. But our pocket book is not infinite so we need your help to finish the last three chapters in this series.\nBesides, I know you want to know the truth about \u201cThe Shifter.\u201d\nWhere the money goes:\nYour backing would enable us to complete the final three issues in the series and print all six issues in a soft-bound book (136 pages). To break it down further, your support would be paying for the following: My fabulous artist, Emily Hu, the equally wonderful colorists, Gloria Caeli and Fahriza Kamaputra\u2026.And Troy Peteri, my letterer extraordinaire. Your help will also pay for the drawing, inking and coloring of an original cover and additional artwork, plus production costs, printing of the soft-bound book and shipping (which includes mailing envelopes, postage and handling.) By the way, postage will go up after the first of the year so I have to take that into account. And, of course, the Amazon fees (5% off the top, plus credit card fees.) \nTHE TEAM:\nMadeleine Holly-Rosing: Writer/Creator: A TV and feature film writer, Madeleine holds an MFA in Screenwriting from UCLA where she won numerous awards as well as the Sloan Fellowship which requires integrating science and technology themes into a script. She has also done work-for-hire and developed her scripts with various producers. Madeleine has just completed her first novel, a middle-grade fantasy, and has published a number of short stories and novellas based on the BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY universe which are available on Kindle, Nook and Smashwords. Her short story, THE CLOCKWORK MAN was published in eSteampunk magazine (February 2013) and THE WAY HOME will be published in an A1/Atomeka/Titan Comics anthology in October 2013 along with three special illustrations by Emily Hu. Formerly a nationally ranked epee fencer, she has competed nationally and internationally. She is an avid reader of science fiction, steampunk, fantasy and historical military fiction.\nEmily Hu \u2013 Artist: Emily is a graduate from the School of Visual Arts in New York City. She has been drawing ever since she was little and it's been her lifelong dream to make it as a comic book artist. Her main influences are Eduardo Risso, Becky Cloonan, and Ito Junji. She enjoys watching medical documentaries and ran through six in a row on one particularly grueling deadline night. Other hobbies include reading, sleeping, and eating. BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY is her first comic book series.\nGloria Caeli \u2013 Colorist: Born in Jakarta, 1988. Studied Visual Communication Design in Bina Nusantara University from 2006 to 2010 and had her first job in Avicom Advertising in November 2010. Gloria very quickly came to the attention of Stellar Labs whom she joined in May 2011. Her most recent projects are BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY and VOODOO. She like anyone else enjoys music, photography, travelling, and reads a lot of genre related books.\nFahriza Kamaputra \u2013 Colorist: Born in 1983 and raised in southern Jakarta. Fahriza grew up immersed in comic books and video games which kept his interest even after finishing school and studying Information Technology at college. It was this interest and the inspiration of other great artists in Indonesia that he decided to follow his dreams to do concept art, comics and film work by training himself with the help of friends to become an artist. In 2010 he worked as colorist on a local comic book VIENETTA AND THE STUPID ALIENS which led to his work on the webcomic ROKKI with the studio Stellar Labs.\nTroy Peteri \u2013 Letterer: Born in the frozen tundra of Wisconsin, Troy moved to Los Angeles heeding the call of comic books. That call is as low-paying as it sounds. With each passing year he has loved working in comics more and more, and has enjoyed the taste of Top Ramen and value meals less and less. But on the plus side, he's had his name in many, many comics and trade paperbacks. Which still geeks him out. The more well-known comics include AMAZING SPIDER-MAN, IRON MAN, and roughly 98% of all the comics from Top Cow Productions for the last 6+ years. He also co-wrote (and lettered) a mini-series for Radical Comics called ABATTOIR. He hopes to write more comics in the near future, as soon as they find a way to put more than 24 hours in a day.\nPlease visit www.bostonmetaphysicalsociety.com and see for yourself what we\u2019ve accomplished.\nAWARDS:\nRecipient of an Honorable Mention at the Geekie Awards (2013)\nNominated for a Steampunk Chronicle\u2019s Reader\u2019s Choice Award (2013)\nNominated for an Airship Award (SteamCon 2012)\nSEE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE SAY ABOUT BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY:\n\"With over <cough, cough> years in the comic business as a writer, editor, artist and a publisher, I\u2019ve worked with many new and established talented writers and artists. Madeleine Holly-Rosing and Emily Hu are the real deal. It\u2019s hard to believe that BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY is their first comic book series. With its spot on writing and elegant illustrations it's got something that crosses over genres and refuses to be pigeon-holed. We'll see more of this dynamic duo. Back this Kickstarter with me and you'll be able to boast you knew them when as well.\" \u2013 Dave Elliott, A1/Atomeka Press\n\"As a huge fan of steampunk, I was very happy to be introduced to the webcomic BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY. Ms. Holly-Rosing nails the tone with her expert writing and her artist, Ms. Hu, is a wonder. I definitely want to see how this story ends and will be backing this Kickstarter. (As you should too.)\" - Bryn Pryor (Writer/Director, Cowboys and Engines)\n\u201cBoston Metaphysical took the scientific and engineering greats of the Victorian era and mixed them with ghost hunters. It\u2019s history and mystery blended into a fascinating story that can't be put down!\" - Travis Sivart (Host of Sounds of Steam, a Steampunk radio show)\n\u201cGood ideas are hard to come by, but it\u2019s rarely the hardest part of making a story work. Details matter, and execution turns a good idea great. Madeleine Holly-Rosing had a good idea: a Steampunk take on a supernatural procedural. But it\u2019s the details that make this book sing. She\u2019s created characters we care about, monsters we want to know more about, and juxtaposed them against real history and real historical figures in such a way that always leaves us wanting more. This is a perfect example of a good idea made great through solid craftsmanship, not just by Madeleine, but by her whole team.\u201d - Nunzio DeFilippis and Christina Weir (Writers \u2013 New X-Men: Academy X, The Avalon Chronicles, Amazing Agent Luna)\n\u201cThe Boston Metaphysical Society promises to be an exciting addition to the Steampunk canon.\u201d AJ Sikes (Doctor Fantastique\u2019s Show of Wonders)\n\u201cBoston Metaphysical Society is a healthy dose of steampunk, a little manga, some history, a wee bit of creepy and a lot of fun storytelling. This book is gripping in its uniqueness and execution; a well-oiled machine worth every cent of your backing.\u201d -Dale Wilson, BuyIndieComics.com\n\u201cBoston Metaphysical is one of my favorite webcomics not just because I'm a sucker for any comics that feature Harry Houdini in lead roles (though I am) or because I love comics that use ghosts in different ways than most strips do (though I am). No, Boston Metaphysical is one of my favorite webcomics because Madeleine Holly-Rosing creates a wonderful fictional world with bold characters and thoroughly entertaining plots. And because of Houdini and the ghosts. I like ghosts.\u201d-Jason Sacks, Publisher, Comics Bulletin www.comicsbulletin.com\n\"The Boston Metaphysical Society has more diversity in a story set over 100 years ago in Boston then most modern day stories in New York City do, that alone should let you know this series is different in a great way.

I developed the script and entire plot synopsis and submitted it in order to receive my Bachelor's thesis in 2011. It is inspired by my studies in Shamanism, Norse, Finnish and Vedic/Hindu mythology--as well as comic book/new media history. \nKALI-YUGA is an epic dark fantasy/sci-fi graphic novel trilogy concerning the fate of the heroic, time traveling wizard named Abaraiis, who is born as a 500 year old man.\nAbaraiis (the Odinic wanderer) is reluctantly involved in a war with the seven immortal Lizard Kings\u2014a powerful alien race who utilize a form of sorcery known as Kaos magic that manipulates the fabric of space-time itself. \nThe first issue, will deal with the struggle of Abaraiis to defeat the five Necromancers, masters of void magic, as well as the formidable Queen Neriti (Freyja); a sorceress hailing from the time of Atlantis but now living in the year 3030. \nThe Queen believes that technology and a rare alien manufactured drug called DMZ will be the key to her own immortality. In her quest for DMZ, Queen Neriti manipulates both the Lizard Kings and the invisible machine elves from the 6th dimension to conjure a unique bio-mechanical space craft, allowing her to extend both cognitive intelligence and the limits of mortality far beyond normal capacity.\nKALI-YUGA will utilize the genres of cyberpunk, fantasy, space opera and steampunk to create an unforgettable action packed epic with deep metaphysical implications.\nWHY KICKSTARTER? \nLike the author Charles Eisenstein (who coined the term \"gift economy\") we see digital based crowd funding as the economy of the future.\n\nA recent interview from Disinformation gets into some of the philosophical intentions of KALI-YUGA. \n\nAn audio podcast interview from the hilarious brothers @ The Womb Mates can be found here. \n\"On the Divine Feminine in Comics\" on Reality Sandwich here.\n\nAnother interview from A Place to Hang Your Cape which discusses literary/comic/mythological influences can be found here.\nKickstarter is an ideal medium for an independent comic. When Kickstarter didn\u2019t exist it was considerably more difficult to obtain financial support for truly independent creative projects. We know this from our previous experience in the publishing industry, as well as in TV and Film production. Kickstarter puts the creative control back in the hands of artists and visionaries.\nThe KALI-YUGA production team has an extensive reputation in the publishing industry to protect, and therefore we promise to give our undivided attention towards the first issue, so that we can run the press circuit and continue to do this work at the professional level full time. This way, our dream of completing this series and eventually printing it as a hardcover book can finally come true.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIn our previous Kickstarter campaign we realized from watching other successful projects that it would be better to start out small. 20 pages and a very attainable financial goal will allow us to build a solid fan base for our near future goal of printing the first 120 page volume of this epic graphic novel trilogy.

The campaign is now over, which means Kickstarter has frozen this page and it can never be updated.  Which means that everything here is absolutely, 100% guaranteed to be hopelessly and comically out of date.  The actual Robot Turtles activity is now happening at www.RobotTurtles.com, where you should proceed immediately (after watching my adorable children in the video above). \nThank you so very, very much for your support.\n-- Dan Shapiro\nRobot Turtles Forever!\nAnd now, the campaign that started it all...\nRobot Turtles is a board game for kids ages 3-8. It takes seconds to learn, minutes to play, and will keep them learning for hours. Kids won't know it but while they're playing, they're learning the fundamentals of programming.\nI'm a father of four year old twins.  Teaching them to program a computer is the single greatest superpower I can give them. I made Robot Turtles so that my kids could learn programming basics without needing a computer. In fact, they don't even need to be able to read!\nI've been told that this would never sell in the toy aisle.  I've shown it to board game designers and manufacturers; they told me this would never work on store shelves. Learning programming just sounds too complicated.\nBut I disagree.  I think programming can be as simple as playing with these four turtles.\nThat's why I'm here on Kickstarter.  If there are a thousand of us, we can do this.  I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone in believing that programming literacy is going to be key to our children\u2019s future. How many of us are there?\nI\u2019m a software guy who\u2019s been programming since I was 7 years old.  I invented Robot Turtles as I pondered these questions in the shower one morning:\n1) Why are kid games either pure luck (Candyland) or a frustrating exercise in trying to lose on purpose, without the child noticing (Tic-Tac-Toe)?\n2) How old does a child need to be to learn to program? (Do they even need to read?)\n3) What's something cool I can do with my kids this afternoon?\nI got out of the shower, printed out some generic robot clip art, and told my 4-year-old twins that I had a new game for us to play.  We started experimenting with the rules, and the kids couldn't get enough of it.\nI got so excited about this game that I took a leave of absence from my job at Google and spent the summer working full time to develop it.\nNow I just need to find homes for 1,000 copies so I can meet the factory minimum order!\nOne of the unique things about Robot Turtles is that only one person (the \u201cTurtle Mover\u201d) needs to read the rules. That means the kids can just start playing!  Here\u2019s how it unfolds.\nFirst, put away the Laser and Function Frog cards.  They'll get to unlock these later!\nEvery player (\u201cTurtle Master\u201d) gets to pick a turtle and gets a matching deck of cards.  \nStack the cards on the table, in piles, face up, and build a maze for each player out of walls and a jewel.\nThen read these three rules out loud to your turtle masters:\nThe youngest turtle master goes first.  They put their first card down and you move the turtle accordingly.\nIt might help to point out that the purple card turns the turtle toward the purple flower, the yellow card toward the yellow flower, etc.\nAs they progress, they build their program up on the table. If they make a mistake, they can shout \"Bug!\" and debug it.\nPretty soon your kids will figure out the secret of Robot Turtles: it lets the kids control the grownups!  The little programmers put instruction cards down, driving the turtles through the maze, but the grownup is the computer, executing commands on the board.  At its heart, Robot Turtles is a game about bossing around adults. Just like programming is about bossing around computers.\nKids love unlocking new features of Robot Turtles, like powerups in a video game.  Each unlockable changes the game to make it more challenging, so Robot Turtles can grow with your children.\nIt may not look like it, but Robot Turtles is a very simple programming language.  It drew its inspiration from Logo, the first programming language I learned as a kid (and the first programming language to prominently feature a turtle).  \nWhile the Robot Turtles programming language isn\u2019t Turing complete, it prepares kids with the skills they\u2019ll need to learn to love programming as they grow up:\nExperiential learning. Kids start the game the same way they start programming \u2013 at the command line. Every instruction they issue is executed immediately. They quickly discover that they can learn by trying things out.\nDebugging. The \u201cBug\u201d undo feature offers the simple confidence that they can try anything. If it doesn\u2019t work out, they know they can back up and try again. For new computer learners, discovering that there\u2019s no cost for being wrong is essential to their growth.\nLimited syntax. Computer programming is about expressing complicated ideas with just a few simple building blocks. The first time they play, kids will want to tell you what to do, or point the cards sideways to make them do something different. Learning Robot Turtles is a process of learning to use a new, simple language to express complicated thoughts.\nOrder of operations. It\u2019s quickly apparent that \u201cforward, forward, right\u201d is very different from \u201cright, forward, forward\u201d.\nPlanning a program. There\u2019s nothing more cool then when kids graduate to \u201cPlay 3\u201d and \u201cWrite Program\u201d and you see them planning out the whole course in their heads. Just like real programmers, they mentally run their code and debug it. Then they get frustrated and just try it to see what happens\u2026 also like real programmers.\nFunctions and optimizations. Although the youngest turtle masters may not be old enough for Write Program and Function Frog, this offers slightly older kids a level of abstraction and challenge on par with \u201creal\u201d programming. Yes, kindergartners can refactor code!\nComputers work for you. Somewhere along the line, programmers learn that writing code isn\u2019t like doing your homework \u2013 it\u2019s like ordering around a devoted (if not very bright) servant. Guess what? You are the computer and they get to order you around. (That\u2019s why kids love this game!)\nMade in America\nI spent a lot of time figuring out the best manufacturer for Robot Turtles, but in the end the decision was easy.  Delano Service is based in Battle Creek, Michigan.  They're over a century old and manufacture fantastic games like Anomia and Fluxx. Their CEO, Kim Drayer, is wicked sharp and a pleasure to work with.  And while we live in an international economy, I'm particularly proud to be able to send your family something that was made entirely in the country in which I live.  No matter where you may be! Which takes us to...\nInternational Backers\nRobot Turtles has the most amazing backers imaginable. 47 volunteer translators have already offered their services to help localize the Robot Turtles instructions in to 21 languages.  The game has no text except the instructions and the box art, so it's perfect for audiences around the world.  So far, backers plan to have the instructions available in the following languages:\nAfrikaans , Catalan, Chinese (Simplified) , Danish, Dutch, Australian English, UK English, Finnish, French , German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian , Polish, Portuguese , Romanian, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish.\nIf you would like to help, please sign up!\nRobot Turtles is available internationally for a single, fixed shipping price. All tiers except the early bird pricing tier (read why) are available to international backers, including the 3-pack and 10-pack discount tiers.\nI can't believe you made it this far.\nBut if you did, you must be terribly interested in what kind of turtle experiences are available!  I will try not to disappoint.  If anything's unclear, let me know and I will clarify.  It's frustrating when you can't figure out what's in a pledge level and what isn't, so I tried to summarize each one below for you.\nThank you ($1)\nThank you for your support! Every dollar helps bring these adorable robotic terrapins in to existence. \nSummary:\nMy thanks, transmitted psychically and through email\nEarly Turtle: Full Game with Discount ($29) \nSmall print runs of games are extremely expensive - most of the cost comes from set up, so the first thousand copies are the most expensive. Still, I want to get Robot Turtles in as many hands as possible. So the first people to pledge get robot turtles for just $29, including free shipping in the US. Unfortunately this tier is not available internationally (read why). \nIncluded in the box, you get:\n1 quad fold game board (20\" x 20\" heavy duty chipboard)\n1 full-color set of rules\n4 robot turtle tiles (all tiles are 2\" x 2\" heavy chipboard)\n4 decks of cards (one for each turtle player) - 36 poker-sized cards each\n14 stone wall tiles and 10 ice wall tiles\n4 robot gem tiles\nand an incomparably good time with the kids!\nUpdate: the incredible backers of this project have enabled me to make the game even better!

See the updates section for details.\nSummary:\n1 game\nRobot Turtle: Full Game ($40)\nIf you pledge at this level, you'll get the same as the Early Turtle tier. Unlike the Early Turtle tier, this one can be shipped internationally (and so can all the tiers below).\nSummary:\n1 game\nThank-you Turtle: Letter & Game ($60) \nYour kid is going to be very happy: in addition to the full game, your child(ren) get a full-color letter, addressed to them by name, with an inked turtle-foot signature on the bottom. You get to choose which turtle sends it, too. And inside the game box? Their name is in the credits in the manual! This tier includes one letter with up to four children's names on it.  Note that an email will be sent asking for your children's names on Sept 27, and you must reply within three days of the project's closing (by midnight PST on September 30th) in order for them to be included in the manual.  You also get a digital printable version of award-winning illustrator Matthew Cordell's \"Turtles Playing Turtles\".\nUpdate: Because of your incredible support, a full color pick-your-own-path 32-page ebook will be included at this tier!  It's a fantastic tale where kids make decisions at each page that guide the story. It tells how Beep the turtle learns how to work with his new friend the Function Frog.  \nHere's a draft of the first of the 16 amazing illustrations in the book.

Something gorgeous. Something 3D.\nSomething that gave me an excuse to spend some quality time with a 100-watt CO2 laser cutter.\nAfter evaluating miniatures (big minimum order), 3D printing (ugly plastic and too expensive), and various handmade options (I have no artistic skill whatsoever), I settled on laser turtles - a special edition where all the tiles are upgraded to pure laser-made awesomeness.  \nEach one of these is made by hand, probably by me although I'm still entertaining fantasies of recruiting someone's teenager to babysit the lasercutter. They are labeled for ages 12+ (not for little ones) because they absolutely cannot go in little mouths.  But damn, do these make the game amazing!  (This tier also comes with the standard game, which you'll need for the board and cards, plus you can play it with younger ones). And you get the Thank-You Turtle.\nHere are the current prototypes. I'm going to keep experimenting with methods and materials to make this as fantastic as it can possibly be!\nIt is awesome.\nIf you want the laser turtles AND another tier, see the FAQ entry for \"How do I get two rewards?\"  \nSummary:  \nFull color pick-your-own-path ebook  \nPrintable version of \"Turtles Playing Turtles\" by Matthew Cordell\n1 thank-you letter\nThank-you in the manual\n1 game\n1 Laser Turtles upgrade pack\nTen Turtles: School-size Deca-pack ($240) \nA very noble cause.

Your support was spectacular. We did it. Production art is starting; the game is going to go to press. WOOHOO!\nMore early birds.  My $40 price was based around a 1,000 unit minimum order.  I had no idea there was going to be this kind of excitement. That means I get to place a bigger order, which means I get to make more units available at a discount!  (Note that, because international shipping is already discounted, I can't offer it as an option for Early Bird, so the best value for international backers is the 3- and 10-packs). \nInstant coloring sheets thank-you. For hitting (and then blasting through) the $60k stretch goal, Backers at the $1 level and up can go here and download a PDF of six coloring sheets. This is completely free, with no DRM, and available immediately.  \nRobot Turtles in the news. You can read about the project all over the tech news.  Here's the list of articles. \nRobot Turtles: Galapagos Rules.  Us old codgers can enjoy Robot Turtles too!  Raising $150,000 has unlocked a new set of rules that allows older kids (8+) and grownups to play after the kids go to sleep.  It's incredibly fun!\nCommunity website. Raising $200,000 has unlocked a community site to collaborate on new game ideas, translations of the manual, share pictures, and more.\nDouble-sided tiles. Raising $250,000 has unlocked tiles printed on both sides, so when your kid melts ice walls, you flip them over to reveal puddles!\nMulticolor jewels.  Instead of just having green robot jewel tiles, the four jewels will come in four colors: sapphire, amathyst, ruby, and emerald.  \nLimited edition print. Award-winning children's artist Matthew Cordell has created a limited edition of 25 prints, \"Turtles playing turtles\", that are available at two pledge levels, signed and personalized by the artist. \nPrintable \"Turtles Playing Turtles\" For those of you who don't get the collectible limited edition print, all pledges at $60 or higher will get a digital, printable version of the print. \nPick your own path book. All backers at the $1 level and up get the text; backers at the \"Thank-you Turtle ($60)\" and up levels get a full-color ebook! This is shaping up to be an amazing 32-page book, illustrated in a style similar to the box cover, where kids get to decide at each page what to do next.\n50% more tiles. The original design had 32 tiles, which was plenty for basic play but could run a little shy if you really wanted to build something incredible. Every copy of the game now comes with extra walls for a total of a ridiculous 48 tiles, enough for mazes that would make a minotaur marvel. \nWe found a bug. Every game now comes with four unique bug cards, one in each deck, that kids can point to when they find a problem with their program.\nMore cards. Each deck has been upgraded from 36 to 45 cards, for bigger mazes and more turtle goodness!\nThanks so much for making it all the way to the bottom.  This project has been amazing because of people like you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first time delivering a board game. I've spent months learning everything I can about the process and interviewing some of the greatest game developers around. I've been cataloging a huge litany of problems and mistakes, and making plans to avoid them. Here's what I've come up with.\n\nI'm working with Delano Services, a major game publisher in Battle Creek, MI, that's been in business for over a century. I've quoted every aspect of the process so I know the costs and materials used. I've talked to the CEO, who fully supports the project, and has agreed to let me fly in for the initial print run to inspect the results (and to package up the collector's edition boxes and ship them immediately). \n\nBecause Delano is in the US, I can and will hop on a plane if something goes wrong. Since Robot Turtles uses standard cardboard parts, the risks of unforeseen production difficulties are minimal (but not zero). \n\nShipping is something that trips up many Kickstarters, so I've been working on that for a while. It's insanely expensive. If I took delivery of a pallet of games to my basement and shipped them out to you via UPS ground, it would cost me more to ship the game than it would to manufacture it! So instead, I'm shipping the games to Amazon and using their third party fulfillment services, which saves cost (and my basement, and my sanity). \n\nBut that adds another level of complexity. So I've spent some time working with an ex-Amazon consultant to do my best to ensure that everything goes smoothly. \n\nMy biggest concern isn't actually getting you the game. It's getting you the game in time for Christmas. I've reviewed the schedule with Delano, and everyone's confident that they can do it. But in the unlikely event that something holds up production of the game - natural disaster, turtle rebellion - I will get all the backers a print-and-play PDF version, then ship the games ASAP. I don't think it'll come to that, but that's the backup plan.\n\nInternational backers have additional uncertainty. It is more likely that shipments may miss the holidays because of shipping delays, customs holdups, or border gremlins. I don't know the taxes, duties, or tariffs you may owe when the game arrives. \n\nIt's possible that, if problems occur, I may not be able to fix them to your liking. My options to make things better will be limited to refunds and, if extra inventory is still available, replacements. If extra inventory isn't available (or if there's a problem that can't be fixed, like a special reward that can't be delivered), then you're going to be stuck with a refund instead of a game.\n\nBut I'm deeply committed to getting this product in to your hands, and the hands of your kids, as quickly as possible.

It's the ground floor for ideas. There's no thought of how to market your idea, what the intended audience is, or how this idea could possibly ever work in reality. It's just raw, artistic reactions to what your brain is firing off at the moment, captured forever in pencil and ink.\nI'll take any chance I can get to peek at other artist's sketchbooks, and I'm more than happy to share mine. It is in this spirit that the desire to print DRAWINGS came about.\nFor years I've collected my drawings in little books, but they've all been in black and white, and cheaply produced. DRAWINGS will be the largest collection of drawings I've ever printed, and the first in full color.\nI'm taking raw scans and putting them right in the book. No Photoshop, no edits. Every ink stroke, pencil sketch, mess up, and correction will be preserved.\nThe Details:\n- At 7.5x9.5 inches, it will be exactly the same size as the sketchbooks I draw in every day.\n- 100 full color pages of robots, spacemen, vehicles, spaceships, and more.\n- Durable softcover matte lamination, sewn perfect bound.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nI can't believe how fast we passed the original goal!

I also want to reward my backers even more, so I'm implementing the following stretch goals.\nGOAL #1\nI've been hearing how much people like this image and I want to my backers to have it. For this first goal I thought that instead of being about money, it's about getting more people on board here. So, when DRAWINGS reaches 800 backers I'll include an exclusive Flower Robot print for all the $50 tiers and above. It's only available through this Kickstarter, so tell you friends and spread the word!\nGOAL #2\nSince the last stretch goal was about rewarding the backers, this time it's about making the book better. DRAWINGS hit its #2 stretch goal and is getting an extra 28 pages added! THANK YOU so much for all the support.\nREWARDS:\nAll books and prints are signed and packed in plastic sheeting and heavy duty cardboard casing that should withstand even the bumpiest ride to your door. Domestic shipping is included in the price, however international backers must add $25* to cover shipping to your country (sorry Canada, you too).\n*Tiers with extra prints and artwork are $26. The additional dollar covers the extra packing material like protective sleeves.\nBONUS REWARDS!\nAlien & Dinosaur Print!\nThe Jake Parker Digital Sketchbook Collection!\nTWO NEW REWARD LEVELS: The Jake Parker Digital Sketchbook Collection!\nAll tiers at the $50 level and higher will get the Digital Sketchbook Collection added to their reward!\nTHANK YOU!\nThank you so much for taking the time to look at my project. I love Kickstarter not just because it gives creatives like me of the opportunity to fulfill our dreams, but for the way it facilitates community.

Please watch our video above to hear about SUBTEXT, and you\u2019ll find more details below.\nThe Story \nSUBTEXT tells the story of Claire, a young stylist who begrudgingly maintains an open relationship with her boyfriend Scott, an ad agency executive who is out of town on business. He suggests that Claire meet the \u201cother woman\u201d, Whitney, an aspiring actress who is curious to have an intimate tryst with Claire once he\u2019s back. When Whitney and Claire agree to meet at a nightclub, the truth behind the texts is revealed.\nThe Theme\nSUBTEXT explores the contemporary methods in which relationships are formed, maintained and ended, all through phone texts. This now common-place mode of communication has changed the way we express ourselves, allowing sound-bites and emoticons to either set the tone or kill the vibe.\nIn SUBTEXT, power plays are made with the push of a button, and the consequences of navigating relationships through texts are felt without ever speaking a word.\nThe Mood and Style of SUBTEXT \nPrimarily told without dialogue, this live-action short film will be propelled by a series of tableaus, with texts appearing as they are received and sent floating within the environments that our characters inhabit.\nThe look and feel of SUBTEXT will evoke the shooting style seen in films like Sophia Coppola\u2019s \u2018The Virgin Suicides\u2019, and Won Kar-Wai\u2019s \u2018In The Mood for Love\u2019 \u2013 sublime and voyeuristic, with natural light setting the tone, color and mood, of each scene.\nThe sound design will be naturalistic with minimal use of music.  The detached mode of text communication employed by our characters is contrasted with an intimate sense of place and solitude.  Each location\u2019s natural sound is emphasized against the silence of our performers, and punctuated by the chirping sounds their Smart-phones make as they fire off and receive their potent text messages.\nWhere the Money Goes\nWe have budgeted for the following production stages:\nCast\nCrew\nEquipment\nWardrobe and Styling\nSets and Props\nEditing\nPost Production Effects\nSound Design\nMusic\n\nCast and Crew \nMoviemaking is ultimately a human endeavor, where many craftspeople come together to tell a little slice of the human story. To this end, often the largest expense in making a film is paying for the highly skilled people involved.\nTo make a production run smoothly, efficiently and stay on schedule, a project benefits greatly from an experienced crew to move the production days forward and support the creative process. In the end it is craft and teamwork that ultimately bring a vision to life.\nIn our experience it is important to offer cast and crew some form of compensation for their hard work. With this in mind we have budgeted a modest rate for all of our talent and crew to acknowledge the great effort they will bring to our production of SUBTEXT.\nOn-Set Meals \nFood is an equally important part of a production, keeping everyone fueled up, focused and at the top of their game for the long days on set. We have budgeted to feed our cast and crew of 15-18 people, during the two-day production.\nOther production phase expenses include:\nCamera and lighting rental\nWardrobe and styling\nSet decoration and props\n\nTo keep these production expenses down, we will be negotiating deals on equipment, working with the talent to supply their own wardrobe, and accessing in-kind support for sets and props.\nEditing \nMost of the editing expenses will be covered since we edit our productions in-house and have the equipment to achieve this phase of the process. Minimal expenses will cover additional hard drives to store all the media that we\u2019ve generated during our shoot.\nSpecial Effects \nWe are allocating the lion's share of our post production budget for special effects. The visual portrayal of our characters\u2019 texts will be an important creative aspect of SUBTEXT. We will be working closely with a Postproduction Effects Designer to compose exciting ways to reveal the text communications between our characters.\nSound Design and Music \nSound is the often-overlooked phase of many independent films and can make or break the final result. If anything is out of place you will see or feel it and quickly be taken out of the experience. Sound is that subliminal layer that connects the subconscious and creates a direct emotional current between you and the film. \nWe will be using part of our budget to compose an original soundtrack, license music, and mix the final audio.\nWhat happens when the film is complete?\nWe plan to enter SUBTEXT in a number of regional and national film festivals, the earliest of which would happen this fall (subject to the film being chosen to screen). There are also a growing number of online platforms accessible throughout the world for releasing independent films, which can then be streamed On-Demand.   \nWe plan to launch the film online through Vimeo\u2019s new On-Demand platform shortly after the SUBTEXT World Premiere.\nEveryone who contributes to the making of SUBTEXT will have access to a free streaming link of the film, along with other rewards at various levels listed to the right.\nPrevious films by Jacob and Arnold Pander\nThank you! \nWe send you heart-felt gratitude for taking the time to read about SUBTEXT! \nKickstarter provides an innovative and unique opportunity for artists to realize their personal visions and share them with the world.  But it's all or nothing with Kickstarter!  If we don't reach our goal, we will not be able to produce SUBTEXT in June. \nYou can be a part of this project in many ways. From sharing our page with your family and friends, to taking advantage of the many rewards we are making available through Kickstarter.  We hope you will find these rewards enticing.  We'd love to have you join our team as we bring this exciting short film to life!\nFollow us on Facebook and Twitter.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOne of the stressful, yet exciting aspects of making movies is that no matter how much you plan, once you are on location and shooting you are always at the mercy of nature and chance. This can sometimes sabotage a production (storms, floods, earthquakes, your lead actor trips and falls on the way to the set, you name it), but often it creates those magic opportunities that you never expected, making a good film suddenly great! Filmmaking as an art form is about creating that perfect balance of organized chaos where creativity and expression are free to flourish without inhibition while supported by a fluid structure that keeps the cameras rolling and helps capture the best performances and all the shots that you\u2019ve painstakingly planned for, all within the short window of production. In our case, two days of filming. \n\nTo best ensure this perfect alignment of creativity and productivity we are building our cast and crew from Portland\u2019s ever-growing pool of experienced talent, many of whom have been honing their craft on the number of major network and cable shows being produced right here in Portland, including, Grimm, Leverage, and Portlandia.\n\nWe are confident that once we reach our Kickstarter goal, we will hit the ground running with a great team, ensuring the success of SUBTEXT!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #14", "update_userinfo": "Time to Promote SUBTEXT - Now Available Exclusively on Seed & Spark", "update_content": "Hello friends and supporters of SUBTEXT.

I see Facebook in my dreams (and nightmares). We debated long and hard about going this crowd-funding route - but it has turned out to be one of the best decisions we've made. \nKickstarter is a community of project supporters who engage at the highest levels of involvement. Even if we didn't need these funds - and even if we hadn't succeeded to reach our goal - it would still have been an extremely valuable experience to connect in this way with the potential audience for Radio Free Albemuth. But reaching our goal - and surpassing it - is an unbelievable high. \nGetting the film rights, adapting the novel to screenplay, getting production financing, the ambitious production on a 24 days schedule; post-production and creating close to 200 CGI shots - Nothing about these challenges has been easy. \nThanks to all of you who backed the project. I always knew the spirit of Philip K. Dick that guided this movie from the start would not let us down. It took nearly ten years for this very special novel to finally be published and over thirty years for his journals about the experiences of February/March 1974 to find their way into the light. But just as PKD came to believe - there does seem to be a Vast Active Living Intelligence at work in all this. And it's taken longer than we ever thought for this movie to reach this point. So thanks to PKD and thanks to VALIS and thanks to all of you for your support. \nToday is one of the best days ever!\nUPDATE #4\nLess than 3 days to go and we're over the moon that we've exceeded our goal. That said we still have some great incentives available including\nBerkeley Walking tour of Philip K Dick haunts ($75)\nAutographed President Fremont (Scott Wilson) Portrait ($500)\nPresident Fremont Plaque ($600)\nSecret Summit Concert/Party with Special Guest Stuart Hamm joining Composer, Producers and cast members.

Dick.  \nThus far, only audiences at film festivals and special events. Despite great reviews and enthusiastic audience response, traditional companies simply haven\u2019t offered us the kind of distribution that would connect to the audience we believe is out there for Radio Free Albemuth.  That\u2019s why we\u2019re going the self-distribution (DIY) route and reaching out to you on Kickstarter.\nThe producers of Radio Free Albemuth - Dale Rosenbloom (Sundance Audience winning Fuel, and the Shiloh movies )  Stephen Nemeth (Academy Award nominated The Sessions, Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas ), Elizabeth Karr and writer/director/producer John Alan Simon have devised an ambitious, yet cost-effective distribution plan so everyone we made this movie for can see it.\nIncluding you...we hope!\nRFA cast includes Shea Whigham (Silver Linings Playbook, Boardwalk Empire), Multiple Grammy Award Winner Alanis Morissette, Jonathan Scarfe (Perception, Grimm), Katheryn Winnick, (Vikings, Stand Up Guys), Hanna Hall ( The Virgin Suicides, Halloween ), Ashley Greene (The Twilight Films), Golden Globe nominee Scott Wilson (The Ninth Configuration, The Walking Dead), and Oscar nominee Rosemary Harris. \nPhil (Shea Whigham) and Nick Brady (Jonathan Scarfe) at FAP Headquarters.\nWe're confident there\u2019s an audience out there for smart, thoughtful sci-fi films that don\u2019t depend on car chases or super heroes.\nValis Satellite\nRFA\u2019s theme of the value of the individual  against the supremacy of the state remains as relevant today as when the novel was published in 1985.  PKD's prescience resonates today with political events as widely disparate as the Arab Spring, Wikileaks, and the current NSA revelations\nRFA is also full of great music.  Alanis Morissette  has her first lead role and performs an original song.  The critically acclaimed singer-songwriter Robyn Hitchcock gave us nine songs and contributed to the score with the amazing piano virtuososo, composer Ralph Grierson.

This is why we have innovative collaborators on board to support a DIY Theatrical model that will help us to book key markets. The funds raised from this campaign will enable us to four wall some theatres, if necessary, to maximize publicity and exposure for our digital release. (Newspapers and magazines generally won't review or write features about films that don't open in theatres)\n\nWe are painfully aware of how expensive a typical theatrical release is currently. Just to play for a week in one theatre in New York with ads, publicity and marketing can easily cost more than what we are raising on Kickstarter. But by relying on our loyal fan base, grassroots marketing, and avoiding expensive ad buys we will stretch these funds into many more markets than just NYC. As well as to invest in placing our film onto key digital platforms. The equation is simple \u2013 more Kickstarter $$$ raised = a wider release.\n\nWhere pledges come from is also a good barometer of what cities we target for RFA's release. Kickstarter provides community involvement, as well as funds.\n\nWithout audience support for science-fiction films of intellectual substance, the filmmaking landscape will continue to be reduced to \u201ccomic-book\u201d blockbusters, or films with miniscule budgets or independently wealthy patronage that can afford to operate at a loss.\n\nWith the passion of people like you who want to see Radio Free Albemuth, we can smash the conventional wisdom about the kinds of films that audiences want to see.\n\nLet's get this movie into as many theatres and distributed digitally as widely as possible!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 160, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/elizabethkarr/radio-free-albemuth-theatrical-release", "project_name": "RADIO FREE ALBEMUTH Theatrical Release"}}, {"backer": "James Kersey", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Hi, there!

The philosophical underpinnings of Torment drive the game, both mechanically and narratively. Your words, choices, and actions will be your primary weapons.\nA World Unlike Any Other. The game has a fantastic, original setting, with awe-inspiring painterly visuals, imaginative locations, truly offbeat items, and massive feats of magic. In Numenera, however, \u201cmagic\u201d is actually something surprisingly different.\nA Rich, Personal Narrative. The story is thoughtful and character-driven\u2014epic in feel but a deeply personal narrative, with nontraditional characters and companions who have their own motivations and desires that drive them throughout the game.\nReactivity, Choice, and Real Consequences. The game emphasizes replayability and reactivity, and your choices will make a real difference. You can play the game with a different approach and discover entirely new pathways. Most important, we won\u2019t tell you how to play. The best ending is the one you choose, flowing naturally from your actions throughout the game.\nClick this header to learn more about our story at our tumblr site\nThe original Torment was a novel experience, a genre-defying game that helped redefine what was possible in RPG storytelling. We mentioned our Four Pillars above, and describe them in greater detail at our tumblr site.\nHere\u2019s a brief summary of our story:\n\nYou are the Last Castoff, the final link in the chain of the lives of the being they call the Changing God. He once was a man who discovered a way to use the relics of the ancients to cheat death and skip across the face of centuries in a succession of bodies. But he never knew that his bodies lived on as his consciousness fled, a new consciousness arising in each. Now he has awakened an age-old enemy, the Angel of Entropy, and his days of change are gone as the Angel hunts him and all his works. That includes... you.\n\nWith the ever-present threat of oblivion looming over you, you must find your sire before he\u2014and you\u2014are eradicated by the avenging Angel. You will find allies and enemies among the other castoffs. You might inhabit their minds for a time through the devices called \u201cthe Meres,\u201d turning their lives to your advantage. You will travel across the face of the Ninth World, and above and below it, with your companions at your side\u2014or alone, if you wish. Your quest will take you to alternate dimensions and distant worlds under strange suns; particular Meres might afford you even more bizarre experiences, such as folding time itself. And you will build your legacy as you find your answer to the question:\n\nWhat does one life matter?\nSojourner of Worlds (by Chang Yuan)\nClick this header to learn more about gameplay at our tumblr site\nTorment will have a strong emphasis on story and character development, which will permeate other facets of gameplay, such as combat and exploration. The Ninth World is a place of great mystery and wonder, all waiting to be discovered. To read more details of our gameplay plans, including information on Combat, Dialogue, and Companions, please visit our tumblr site.\nYou'll play the role of a specific individual. At the game\u2019s start, however, you are a blank slate and have control over the path you take through the story, and you will also make choices to customize your abilities and skills. We\u2019re taking the approach of having you role-play a specific individual so that we can focus on telling a very personal tale \u2013 yours.\nDust and Water (by Andr\u00e9e Wallin)\nWhat Are the Tides?\nThere are unseen forces in the Ninth World, forces that have profound and lasting effects for those attuned to their motions. Like gravity or magnetism, the Tides are invisible, powerful, and with the right tools, perhaps controllable.\nThe Tides represent complicated concepts that aren't entirely definable by language. Those who acknowledge the Tides have given them symbolic colors based on how they appear to correspond with emotional and psychological reactions. For example:\nThe Tides reflect your choices, the subtle currents of motivation that ripple through your life.\nThe colors are important, because a word like \"justice\" (for example) is too simplistic. The Indigo Tide represents not only justice and fairness; it might also mean a desire for the greater good or an \"end justifies the means\" mentality. The Gold Tide can represent false philanthropy as well as martyrdom\u2014it's the actions that matter, not the motivations. In the game, the Tides serve as a kind of alignment system\u2014but a more nuanced one, and one that does not judge actions based on whether they are good or evil. You'll learn more about the Tides as you explore Torment. And the Tides will gradually change based on your actions and decisions, ultimately determining your Legacy.\nWhat Do You Mean by My Legacy?\nThere's your legacy, the stories others tell about you and the inspirations they find in your life, and your Legacy, which we're systematizing here. Your Legacy is determined by which Tides you manipulate the most. Do you use your wisdom to help others? Do you seek power for the greater good? Maybe you're an avenger, taking whatever action is necessary to aid those around you. Perhaps you're just in it for the prestige. (Or money. People are always in it for the money.) As your choices move the Tides, your Legacy will be revealed.\nYour Legacy also influences the world around you. Weapons and relics may have different bonuses for characters with certain Legacies. Some of them might respond positively if you've revealed yourself to be a thinker or an artist, while others might help you only if you're moved by passion and power.\nYour Legacy opens new potential abilities. Some Legacies can change the very structure of your body, giving you superhuman powers: the ability to read the past in the minds of the dead, for instance, or a nearly supernatural affinity with weapons.\nSagus Cliffs at Dawn (by Chang Yuan)\nClick this header to learn more about our team at our tumblr site\nTorment is being developed by inXile entertainment, a mid-sized independent game developer located in Newport Beach, CA. inXile was founded by Brian Fargo in 2002 and is best known for its action-RPG The Bard\u2019s Tale.

He is a vocal advocate of circumventing the traditional publisher-developer business model, with developers instead communicating and working directly with the players.\nOur experience with crowd funding has been wonderfully positive for us at inXile and has opened our eyes to the power of a direct relationship with the gamers. We want to create RPGs in a fashion and style that helped to make the true classics. And along these lines we've abandoned the typical developer/publisher model and placed our future in the hands of RPG gamers. We've embraced the crowd in every aspect. YOU are our publisher...and you are the best publisher we've ever worked with!\nThis process allows us to create the games exactly the way you want to see them. There is a purity of development when we can spend 100% of our efforts making the game with an open dialogue throughout the process. We'll start with a strong vision document that details our sensibilities, and from there we'll stay in sync with you, from concept through the execution of the ideas.\nWe've discovered that the best way to create a deep and rich RPG is to begin the pre-production process long before the production team have finished their current project. If we waited to begin the design work for a large scale RPG until after the programming team has completed their work, our budget would increase by 50% or more.  This would result in the hiring and firing process that happens all too often in our industry. We want to break that model and keep our great team together. This is why it makes sense for us to begin work on Torment now rather than later. The process has served us well in the past and allows us to bring you the best RPGs. If you have any concerns about our ability to deliver a great one, we encourage you to review our first look video of Wasteland 2 that was released just a few weeks ago.\nWe're grateful for all the support and look forward to bringing you the kind of role-playing games that we all love to play.\nWith Torment, Brian pledged to personally add $100k to the project if we reached the $900,000 goal but fell short of a million. And if funding beat $1 million, he pledged to instead contribute 10 cents from every $1 pledged from the $1 million to $2 million mark. Brian is thus kicking in $100K of his own (this is not reflected in the Kickstarter total and all will be applied directly to the development budget). Torment superfan Steve Dengler (@Dracogen) picked up the torch when we reached $2M, matching 10% of every donation from $2 to $3 million, and thus also putting in $100K of his own. These matches will be added post-Kickstarter to help offset failed pledges, and do not count towards stretch goals.\nThis product is participating in Brian Fargo\u2019s Kicking It Forward initiative, promising to pledge 5% of its post-release profit to other Kickstarter projects. We are proud to join the over 200 successfully funded Kickstarter projects whose founders share Brian\u2019s vision of supporting the independent efforts of others.\nThe Ascension of Kex-Lianish (by Andr\u00e9e Wallin)\nBy pledging at an amount above the Tier you have selected, you can include Add-Ons.

Fortunately, we collectively have more than 80 years of experience in managing them. Given our great progress in developing Wasteland 2, our experience with the technology, and our approach to Torment\u2019s design and production, we are confident in our ability to provide our backers with a quality game deserving of the Torment name.\n\nTorment\u2019s schedule has been designed to maximize both planning (preproduction) and polishing. This extended preproduction period controls costs and increases quality because we\u2019ll have a very well-defined product before production begins. Our target release date of December 2014 allows us 14 months for production and finalization. (In comparison, Wasteland 2 had 12 months, and Mask of the Betrayer had nine.) Furthermore, various systems and tools developed for Wasteland 2 will be used or adapted for Torment, saving development time and budget.\n\nWith a longer schedule, you might wonder how we\u2019ll be able to create Torment if it receives less funding than Wasteland 2 did. First, Torment's story is being designed to be highly modular and scalable. This approach not only lets us increase game reactivity and replayability, but it also let us keep the game's scope flexible. At our target funding, we\u2019ll be able to deliver a complete and satisfying game and as funding increases above the target, Torment will continue to grow in depth and size. But, as resources allow \u2013 if Wasteland 2 is a commercial success, for example \u2013 we are ready to expand the modular story. \n\nAlso, inXile has established secondary revenue streams that will bolster Torment\u2019s development budget. For example, last September, The Bard\u2019s Tale was released on Android, winning many awards and selling hundreds of thousands of copies in just a few months. While this doesn\u2019t provide enough money to create a game like Torment, it lets us invest in Wasteland 2 and Torment to improve their quality. Although Torment would not be possible without your support, we are self-funding a portion of the game as well. Just like you, we want Torment to be the best it can be.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #68", "update_userinfo": "Updated Our Journal (68): Servant of the Tides", "update_content": "tl;dr: Oom\u2019s debut, Content Update, new bonus rewards from Monte Cook Games, and a check-in on backer rewards.\nHey Exiles,\nEric Daily here.
