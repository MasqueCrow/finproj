Bucqle exists of two main parts: the front housing and the back housing. Both parts move in opposite directions, so when you put some fabric in-between, it creates a neat fold in a \u201cZ\u201d shape. When you are happy with your fit and settings of your Bucqle, you want to lock it to secure the front- and back housing. Sounds quite simple, but many times a simple idea, or a simple invention, can be quite challenging when you move from a conceptual design into mass production. We sure did not oversee all that complexity, as we have no prior mass-production experience.

Their craftsmanship is deeply rooted in tradition and they have been thriving for four generations. Together, we created an attainable, handcrafted, ultra-luxury dress shoe that comes packed with features and is designed for comfort. \nOur factory's traditional construction is combined with our innovative design and bold attitude. Ace Marks shoes are built for the modern gentleman. Help us make our SECOND production!\nWhether you\u2019re heading a startup or running a Fortune 500 company, Ace Marks shoes make a bold, powerful statement.\nAce Marks is the first and only luxury brand that will buy back its shoes. Kickstarter supporters will be able to send back their old Ace Marks for a $60 credit towards a new full priced pair purchased from our website. We partnered with Career Gear, a leading national organization helping men in need, to donate your old shoes and help men get back on their feet and re-enter the work force. Last year, we donated over $15,000 in luxury dress shoes to Career Gear! \n  The Luke is a versatile dress shoe that can be worn for your Monday morning meeting, a casual night out and anything in-between. Decorative perforation and broguing details preserve tradition, and novel design curves bring this classic into today. These wingtips strike the perfect balance between traditional and modern.\n  The Kendrik can carry you through your daily office grind or accentuate your look at the local speakeasy. Whether you choose an understated color block or beautiful monocolor look, these full brogue cap toes scream confidence with every step.\n  The Aron's contrasting materials and vibrant leather tones make a statement no matter how you pair them. Dressed up or dress down, it won't matter what you wear because all eyes will be on the monks.\n  The Greg is your best friend. Whether you're grabbing some drinks at a Hamptons soiree or getting better acquainted with your top producers, there's almost no look Greg can't enhance. The leather color combinations are just eccentric enough to be interesting, but not overpowering, and the suedes can make a pair of chinos look fancy.  \n  The Amit goes great with khakis, jeans, and with the right attitude, even a casual suit. Rendered in richly oiled leathers and furnished with a traditional tassel, the Amit fuses a classic preppy style with modern colors and materials.\nOn the Lorenzo, the beautiful hand antiquing and burnishing of the calf skin leathers truly stand out. The Lorenzo can smoothly transition from a day shoe paired with a suit to a powerful accent shoe worn with jeans. \n  The Kevin is a Kickstarter Exclusive! They will not be available again! Pair them with khakis, jeans, and a crazy pair of socks and get a bit wild with your look!\n  Cap Toe Stuart Unlocked @ $100K\n                   ADD A MATCHING BRIEFCASE TO YOUR PLEDGE +$295. IT IS HAND DYED AT OUR FACTORY TO MATCH YOUR SHOES & BELT. \n           ADD A MATCHING BELT TO YOUR PLEDGE +$70. Belts are all one length and can be cut to size. This can be done at home, or at a local shoe repair shop for a nominal fee. \n  Each pair of Ace Marks dress shoes is made with full grain calf skin leather and is crafted, dyed, and burnished by hand. The manual process gives each pair its unique characteristics. Each pair goes through a rigorous inspection to ensure that every shoe is of the highest quality.\nOur manufacturing process is done completely in-house. Each shoe takes great precision and skill to ensure the outcome is impeccable. \n    No middlemen. No crazy markup. Just magnificent shoes at a magnificent price that we will buy back when you're ready for a new pair.\nOur disruptive business model goes beyond cutting out the middle man to give our supporters direct to consumer pricing.\nWe created the Leave Your Marks program to activate the Ace Marks family and incentivize giving back. By sending back your worn Ace Marks Italian Luxury Statement shoes every time you buy a new full priced Italian luxury Statement shoe from www.acemarks.com, you, our Kickstarter supporters, not only get a $60 credit and a great reason to keep your shoe game fresh, you also participate in changing someone's life. \nTo make sure that our shoe donations are put to good use, we partnered with Career Gear to donate them to help men in need enter the workforce, stay employed and become role models and mentors to their families and communities.\nAce Marks is the first and only luxury shoe company to do this!\nSince our first campaign we have donated over $15,000 in luxury shoes to CareerGear and we're excited to see how many more men we can help get back on their feet! \n  When it comes to luxury, no matter how good your shoe looks, comfort is just as important. Ace Marks shoes are bold, flexible, and light. \nWe spent 3 years in development to make sure that we get it right, and we spared no expense. Each pair is superbly handcrafted, hand burnished, and packed with features.   \nThat's why Ace Marks shoes:\nAre made from hand-selected full-grain calf skin leather.  \nUse a lightweight Blake Flex construction and leather outsole that allows for easy, effortless movement. \nReduce common pressure points around the heel and mid-foot with our carefully constructed Ace last (a.k.a. forma). \nRelieve stress as you walk with a cushioned leather insole, which molds to your foot over time for added comfort. \nAre lined with supple calfskin leather to keep your feet dry and cool. \n  Ace Marks was designed for the modern gentleman looking to step up his style and add a bit of swagger. The Ace Marks man is not afraid to be bold in his success. \nCap Toe Kendrick in Brown Antique & Blue Suede\n  Penny Loafer Greg in Chocolate Suede\n  Limited Edition Diablo Antique Tassel Loafers\n  Cap Toe Blucher Stuart in Dk.

By cutting out the middlemen, we\u2019re able to deliver the highest quality product at a market disruptive price. Luxury doesn't have to cost a small fortune.\nAce Marks shoes are statement shoes. They are well-made, attractive and eye-catching shoes that reflects your personality\nOur designs are modern classics in unique color and material combinations, and packed with features\nAce Marks is for the modern gentleman that appreciates craftsmanship and style.\nAce Marks Shoes are available from US size 5 to 14, including half sizes. They are available in 2 width options:\n1) \"D\", medium/standard width cut generously around the midfoot and heel to prevent unnecessary pressure on the foot.\n2) \"E\", wider than a \"D\" width, cut generously around the midfoot and heel to prevent unnecessary pressure on the foot.\nOur shoes fit true to US Brannock sizing. Still, it will be VERY important that you follow our fitting & sizing instructions that we will send at the end of the campaign to get the best fit. \nIf the size you order happens to not be the best fit, we will exchange it for you (please see DELIVERY section below for shipping charges on exchanges). \n    Once the campaign is funded, we expect that it will take 2-3 weeks for us to send the survey and receive back the style, color, and size surveys from all backers. The faster we get them back the less likely any delays!\nProduction typically takes 8-10 weeks, and shipping approximately 3 weeks.\nBy September 2017, or sooner, we expect to be shipping to you from our facilities in the US and EU. \nWe are very experienced in delivering shoes on time! We will do everything in our power to make sure we meet the timeline. \nIf you order it, you will receive it! Every backer will receive his reward. \nShipping is included for all shipments in the continental United States. \nHowever, if the need for an exchange arises, we will need to charge for the exchange shipping both ways as we are a startup and work with very small margins on Kickstarter. This is true for domestic & international orders. \nAll exchange requests must be submitted within 30 days of receiving your reward. \nThe cost of international shipping & VAT (if applicable) will be charged at the time of the survey once the campaign is over and will vary based on the destination country. You can see international shipping rates here. If applicable, duties and local taxes will be charged by the appropriate authority at the destination country. Please determine these charges locally.\nContinental US & Canadian orders will ship from our facility in Miami, FL. \nAll other orders will ship from our fulfillment center in the EU. Orders shipped within the EU will not incur customs duty charges, but will be subject to VAT. \nAce Marks wasn't created on a whim. It is the product of a lifetime of research and experience in the luxury footwear business.\nOur founder, Paul, grew up traveling with his parents to Italy & Spain's shoe factories. Formally educated in International Finance & Marketing at the University of Miami, he and his brother Daniel, as their parents before them, have dedicated their lives to designing and producing luxury footwear of the highest quality. Their footwear experience ranges from designing & manufacturing to marketing, warehousing and logistics. They have done it all.\nTo assure that our supporters receive top notch service, we put together a team with extensive experience in footwear logistics and distribution. \nThis is our second Kickstarter campaign, and we are more prepared than ever to continue surpassing our backer's expectations. We are excited to share our new products and vision with the world!\nQuality. We spent a lot of time finding the best artisans in Italy that have the materials, the facilities, the pedigree and, most importantly, the experience to create a world-class luxury shoe. We spared no expense to make sure that you will get only the best.\nAffordability. By implementing a disruptive business model that delivers your shoes straight from the artisan's hands to your doorsteps, we eliminate the need for retailers, wholesalers, and other middlemen. The workmanship and luxury you will experience with our shoes is incomparable, at a price that is unparalleled. Less than $200 for a $600-$1,000+ shoe. We did it for YOU.\nCommunication. Your commitment to us is the start of a long, beautiful relationship. We are committed to you. We will keep our relationship strong by delivering amazing products and communicate with you every step of the way. You will get regular updates as we fund, produce, and ship out your one-of-a-kind shoes. If you have an itch to talk to us, just get in touch any time!  \nConsistency. Every Ace Marks shoe is hand crafted and hand dyed, meaning that no two pairs are identical. However, each pair goes through a thorough inspection process to assure the quality you expect from a world-class luxury brand.\nExperience & Reliability. Ace Marks was founded by a team with a lifetime of experience in the luxury footwear industry. We don't make commitments that we can't honor. We have the infrastructure to assure a smooth process from taking your order thru delivery. We want to be your go-to brand for all things men's luxury, and we will earn your confidence. \nWe are building more than a shoe, we are building a family. The Ace Marks Family!\nDear Supporters, \nWe spent 3 years, pouring our heart and soul into bringing Ace Marks to life. Last year, we launched our first Kickstarter campaign and the love we felt from the Kickstarter community was overwhelming. We are super excited to share our latest shoes with you first!\nMaking our second collection was no easy task, and we spent many weeks at our factory designing and developing shoes that will make you look good and feel powerful every time you put them on. When you receive your first pair of Ace Marks shoes, it will be clear to you that we accomplished our goal. Now we just need you to help us bring our second collection to life.\nFrom the start, it was also very important to us that Ace Marks makes a strong impact on our community. With so many men and women struggling to support their families, we want to do our part to help them overcome at least one of the obstacles that they are facing, which is to find meaningful employment. That is why we partnered with Career Gear and implemented our buy back program. This past year, we were proud to donate over $15,000 in shoes to help men make an impact on their communities. We hope that our shoe donations will help thousands of men take their first steps into a brighter future.\nWith your help, we will continue to grow Ace Marks into a luxury lifestyle brand driven by a commitment to fine craftsmanship, beautiful aesthetics, and your happiness. It is for you, that we will continue to innovate and create.\nThrough our journey, we have learned that Ace Marks is ultimately about empowerment. We are empowering you with confidence and direct access to luxury statement shoes, and we are empowering men across the country to get back on their feet.\nThank you for allowing us to do what we love and for spreading the word. Share our campaign with the world.\n      YOU are key to the success of our campaign, and ultimately our company. Without you, we don't have a reason to exist!\nWe need your support to get our second collection off the ground and to assure that modern gentleman everywhere have access to luxury Italian statement shoes! \nAs you become part of our inner circle, help us by sharing our campaign with YOUR inner circle.

You may want to have it so it does not cover any device component such as the led indicator and/or light sensor.  \n- Clean the camera area with a screen cleaning product, a product that does not leave any kind of residue is best. Make sure the area is dry. (If you are using a new phone which may have coating polished on, try cleaning the area around the camera first to remove any coating.)\n- To stick the ring, peel the blue liner off of the ring without touching the adhesive side of the ring.  \n- Gently start placing one side of the ring on to your device making sure you are properly aligned, keeping it aligned then place the rest of the ring gently on to your device.  \n- You can still slightly move the ring to align it properly before applying pressure to tighten the adhesive bond.\n- Once placed properly, apply pressure to tighten the adhesive bond.  \n- Finally, place the magnet back on to the ring. \nIn this video we demonstrate to you how to install the IS|CC.\nPLAY\n\n  Simply place your finger on the disc and slide your finger to hide and unhide the web camera. \nIn this video we demonstrate how to use the IS|CC. \nPLAY\n\n  In this video we demonstrate the magnetic strength of our product on a device being pushed in and pulled out of a pocket. \nPLAY\n\n  In this video we drop a device with our product on it, to demonstrate how well it holds.\nPLAY\n\n  To clean the IS|CC and area around simply remove the magnet and clean.\nIn this video we demonstrate how to clean the area around your IS|CC.\nPLAY\n\n  In this video we remove our product.

He called his idea 'New Babylon.' an imaginary borderless system the size of the entire planet were people can travel without restrictions. (more info here and here )\n\"The frequency of each man's movements and the distances he will cover depend on decisions he will make spontaneously\" -Constant Nieuwenhuys.\n-\nThe World Metro Map\nNewYork based Collective ArtCodeData revised this idea to create a map that represents human mobility. The inner life of cities is made of their subways. What would happened if all the lines in the world would be reunited in a single system. Since the tube is the veins and circulatory system of the 'animal-city' if we gather all those possibilities, we could achieve a total circulatory entity?\nThe result is a digital collage that contains 214 metro/subway systems. Totaling 791 lines and 11,924 stations . Every line in this map represents lines and stations in the real world, however all the lines are interconnected in a way that they all form a mega subway system. You can create routes from Times Square Station NewYork all the way to  Beijing National Library Station in China.\nSome of the included cities (see complete list below)\n\"Everything should remain possible, everything should be able to happen. The environment is created by the activities of life not the other way around. \" -Constant Nieuwenhuys (1)\nThe intersection Between Paris and New York\nThe intersection between New York, Moscow and Sao Paulo\nThe intersection between Berlin and Tokyo\nImportant Note: This map is a Work in Progress, The final result will thoroughly be inspected.\nPLAY\n\nThe map comes in 2 different sizes, 40x30 and 60x45, size A is the perfect size for rooms and studios, size B is perfect for living rooms and meeting rooms. Both A and B sizes can be encapsulated with museum quality materials to keep them perfect for years ahead.\nOPTION 1. Printed in Paper\nHigh resolution print using inks that won't fade and paper that won't turn yellow through the years. The map is sent in a mailing tube and ships anywhere in the world.\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nOPTION 2. Printed + Acrylic Encapsulation\nIn case you want something ready to be hanged, the acrylic encapsulation option is right for you. This technique used by galleries and Art museums around the world guarantee high intensity colors and that it stays perfect for years to come.\nWho is behind this Kickstarter Campaign?\nWe are an initiative called \"Open Accessibility\" selling a map to fund our operations.\nAnd what is Open Accessibility Initiative?\nOpen access is an initiative created by a group of individuals interested in facilitating travel for people living with disabilities.\nHow do we plan to reach your goal?\nWe plan to reach our goal by simply creating a large database of accessible environments in frequently travelled cities. We will accomplish this by physically entering facilities and gathering specifications that make a facility accessible.\nBut doesn't Google Maps or Yelp have this kind of info already?\nNo, and that\u2019s exactly the problem, \u2018accessibility\u2019 information in online maps and booking websites are extremely ambiguous if existent at all. Our initiative will allow us to gather a minimum of 50 accessible points that will help facilitate travel plans for people living with disabilities.\nSome of the aspects we include:\n\"where is your ramp located? are the door frames and hallways wide enough for a wheelchair? are there elevators in the building? Are the bathrooms accessible? do the bathrooms have one or two grab bars? where are these grab bars located? is there transportation services accessible to wheelchairs on your location? do they have hearing impaired services?\"\nWhy is this important to us?\nBecause as a fellow traveler we feel that everyone should have the right to enjoy traveling, including the ease of information accessible to travelers. Currently finding information on the best hostel, most accommodating hotel, the best view or even the best continental breakfast is so easy to find. Website blast their cheap prices directly to our emails on a regular basis. However, information on accessibility to a location is still limited. People are left having to call, email and that can be a total waste of time.

The network was built, from the bottom up, by people like you.\nWhen we started spreading the word about our first crowd sourced internet of things data network in Amsterdam, we got an astonishing response from the global IoT community. Within a few days, groups and companies from Sao Paulo, London, Paris, Sydney, Boston, Manchester, and many more were showing interest in the concept, actively starting open LoRaWAN projects using technology from The Things Network.\nThis was our proof that an open, global and crowd sourced Internet of Things data network is possible. Not only that, but we did show that we can deploy with an unprecedented speed.\nTo accelerate this rapid growth even further, and to support our global teams, we have decided to design our own equipment that can help build the network for 20% of the cost compared to other products currently on the market. Both the network\u2019s hardware and software will be open source.\nWe use Kickstarter to make the products more easily available to our community, backers and everyone else around the world who supports our vision and would like to make their hometown a smart city.\nFind out how many people you could be impacting by placing The Things Gateway in your home here.\nProducts\nTo help you make the most of this open network, we are offering the following hardware:\nThe Things Gateway\nThe main building block of the network. Small, easy to install, it essentially is a router between the things and the internet. With it you are creating the most substantial aspect of your connected city\u2019s network.\nAbout 20% of the cost of any currently available LoRaWAN gateway\nProvides up to 10 km / 6 miles radius of network coverage\nConnects easily to your WiFi or Ethernet connection\nSecurity through the https connection and embedded in the LoRaWAN protocol\nRuns on open hardware \nContains GPS to determine the gateway\u2019s location and node's location later\nCan serve up to 10,000 nodes\nOne of our BETA test gateways in action.\n  The Things Uno \nA network is nice, but how about some device to connect it with? \nImagine an Arduino Uno with LoRaWAN connectivity. We thought we are using one of the most popular microcontrollers and make it LoRaWAN ready for you to prototype with. \nUpgrade your existing Arduino project and make it wireless with up to 10 km range. How far is your home away from your office? Compatible with Arduino IDE and existing shields. Includes connections for an optional external antenna on the breakout circuit to maximize the range.\nWill be shipping pre-loaded with our open source LoRa library, which is also freely available on GitHub.\nOh, and we are collaborating with 3D Hubs for a awesome 3d printable enclosure for your Uno right over here. \nThings Uno with external antenna and 3D hubs printed enclosure!\nThe first batch UNO's, these are being tested in the field right now!\nThe Things Node\nA matchbox full of sensors, a light and a button. Show off, or just connect this bunch of sensors to your IFTTT account - it is up to you. It is perfect for the prototyping of use cases without the need for programming skills.\nThe Node includes:\nMovement sensor\nLight sensor\nTemperature sensor\nA button\nRGB light\nWaterproof (IP54) casing\n3 AAA batteries supplying power for over a year of usage.\nThe Node is a versatile device to test or build plug\u2019n\u2019play Internet of Things features. Easy set up as an IFTTT node through our intuitive web interface.\nOpen source / Open hardware\nWe believe in Open Source. From the firmware running on the devices up to the hardware designs and casings. We believe that opening this up to the community will benefit us all.\nProject costs \nThe Kickstarter pledges will pay for design, hardware production, software, backend software and shipment, regulation compliance testing, community and customer management and project documentation so you can see what we are up to.\nLoRaWAN - A new technology optimized for connectivity of things\nAll this is enable by a technology called LoRa. LoRa is a low energy, low bandwidth, long range (over 10km / 6 miles) wireless technology and uses an open data frequency. As we are setting up the network together there is no need for an operator. This amazing technology allows for things to talk to the internet without 3G, WiFi or Bluetooth. No wifi codes, heavy battery usage or worse, monthly subscriptions needed. \nThe technology was standardized by the LoRa Alliance and is a result of a collaboration between IBM and chipmaker Semtech. LoRaWAN is currently active on different open frequencies. Most popular are the 868MHz, the 915MHz and the 433MHz. We make a specialised version of every device according to where they will be shipped to. \nDo not worry, we will reach out to you after the campaign to check which frequency your devices need to be based on your local requirements. \nThe Things Network is an official member of the LoRa Alliance.\nThe technology is currently enrolled in France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium and South Africa. All by larger telecommunication corporations. To make this an open network with no subscriptions we propose a decentralized, crowdsourced alternative to telcos. And to get there we need affordable and open, hardware. \nWe already have made working betas. Check out this video of the hardware on our workbench:\nPLAY\n\nHow secure is this?\nData security and privacy are an essential element of the internet of things and should be taken into account within every aspect of the network architecture: from the nodes to the application server. LoRaWAN uses AES encryption on both the network and the application level using 128 bit keys, with the network keys being unique per node and the application keys being secret. The Things Network offers end-to-end encryption from the nodes to the application server in the scenario where application developers use the Foundation\u2019s hosted routing mechanism and on-premise data handling and decryption.\nHow hard is it to set up?\nThe Things Gateway, Node and Uno work out of the box. The Things Network has an easy to use development service available for you to connect to your devices. We are building this so that you should be able to set it up with no help from us.\n\nHow does the backend work?\nThe Things Network community provides open source components for routing and handling of data which is fully compliant with the LoRaWAN 1.1 specification. The two core components in the network architecture are The Things Router and The Things Handler. Packets received from nodes are forwarded from the gateways to one or more Routers as configured by the gateway owner. The Things Gateway is pre-configured with the default Router hosted by the Foundation for plug-and-play deployment. The Routers publish the packets on their built-in MQTT broker. The Router contains MQTT topics for both uplink and downlink packets. \nThe Handlers receive packets from Routers by subscribing to, and send data to Routers by publishing to their MQTT brokers. Handlers are responsible for message integrity checking, decryption, deduplication, buffering, transformation and dispatching to application servers. The Handler contains Node RED to handle deduplicated and decrypted data and supports custom processing, also using MQTT publishing. The Handler contains built-in integrations with existing internet of things cloud platforms, including IBM Bluemix, AWS IoT, FIWARE, Parse.com, IFTTT and OpenSensors.io.\nFor your smart city, innovation campus and everybody else \nAt The Things Network, we believe with this project we are taking a big step towards a truly connected future for all devices. We think it has never been easier or cheaper to cover large areas or great distances and we just made it cheaper and easier to use through our accessible and plug\u2019n\u2019play approach to software and hardware design. \nAnd it will be available to everyone. Now is the time to build an internet from the ground up, owned and operated in a decentralised way by its very users.\nSmart Cities\nThis is your low-barrier chance to get started with any smart city initiatives. All major cities around the world have this on the agenda and you can have access to it with a simple pledge.\nUniversities\nWe provide educational packages for universities and schools, complete with teaching materials. A The Things Network community manager will help you set it up, if required.\nHackerspaces\nAs a hacker space this is an easy and fun way to get started with LoRa. We are creating license-free courses on our GitHub account, that can help you create workshops.\nEntrepreneurs\nOur Node means you don\u2019t have to have any programming or hardware knowledge to set up your prototype or business idea. LoRa is also a very competitive solution, if you need your own network.\nInspiration for some projects you can build\nPledges\nHave a look at the list of pledges we created. If you have any particular idea on a special set of devices that makes a better pledge, let us know, we can be flexible.\n\nTimeline\nEverything you see in our graphics, photos and videos is based on previously designed prototypes and working small-batch produced devices. The aim of this campaign is to start mass-producing the next version of these devices. Both us and our partners have years of experience producing and mass-producing software and hardware products.\nTeam\nThese products are a joint effort between Tweetonig and The Things Network.\n\nThe Tweetonig Team\nTweetonig is a product development agency with a lot of experience bringing connected products to mass production. The senior team working on this project are: John - general lead, Dimer - plastics engineer, Sven  - embedded system engineer, Maurits - software lead and Diderik - open innovation consultant. \nTweetonig has created mass-produced products like the Glimworm iBeacons and Tuna Knobs DJ Gear, which have already sold worldwide. Now they are bringing their know-how, production and design expertise to The Things Network products.\nJohan and Wienke during the launch conference of the network in Amsterdam\nThe Things Network was founded by Wienke as initiator and Johan as technical lead. Together with the community, they have developed the backend software running on the servers. Find out more about our amazing community here. Johan Stokking has previous expertise by running a sport time tracking company and Wienke Giezeman is a social internet entrepreneur.

So the team knows what they are doing. Also, all things shown in the video or in the pictures do work. There are off course numerous ugly looking prototypes we kept in the shadow as well. And to make sure we are in the loop for coming changes we will become a member of the LoRa alliance network. \n\nTimeline:\nFrom earlier products we developed for customers we have a wide network of strong manufacturing, assembly and distribution partners. That being said in product development there is always a risk involved. We do our best to manage those risk while putting these high-tech products through production. Our shipment dates are targets and while we are sure we can meet them, they are still estimates.

If you missed us during the campaign, click on the link below to go to XYFindIt.com to order XY for yourself.\n XYFindIt.com\nXY is the stylish, affordable, and secure iBeacon compatible Tag for iPhone and Android that makes finding things easy.\n10 minutes a day.\nThe average person spends 10 minutes a day trying to find lost things. That means that on average, you spend over 4 hours a month, 2 days each year, and 6 months of your life trying to find things you own. With XY, you can keep of track everything important to you, and take back that time.\nWhat is XY?\nXY is a Bluetooth LE powered tracking tag that you can put on anything important to you. The tag syncs with your smartphone to help you keep track of all the things that matter to you. You can attach as many XY tags to your phone as you like, and can easily find your nearby tags.\nXY is perfect for putting on your keys, purse, tablet, and luggage. The small stylish design lets you keep track of all your things, and the secure server ensures that you control who is able to see your items. \nXY is also the best way to keep track of your pets. You can easily attach an XY tag to your pet's collar, and know if they leave the house and feel secure in knowing that if they wander off, XY will let you know.  \nHow it Works\nThe XY app listens to nearby Bluetooth LE signals.  When the app finds a new tag, it checks our servers see what information about the tag is available to you.  If you are not permitted to see the tag, it will not show up on your list.  \n1) Find-It: By activating Find-It mode, you can track any tag that is within range of your phone.  The on-screen indicator will show you as you get closer to the tag, and will help you find your misplaced item. If the item is not within range, the app will show you where it was seen last.\n2) Keep-It:  For anything you want to ensure is always by your side, you can activate Keep-It mode, and your phone will alert you if you move out of range of the tag.  In Keep-It mode, you will never leave something important behind again.\n3) Lost-It:  You can mark any tag as lost right from the app. Once it has been set as lost, XY will alert other users if they come across the item, or can just tell you where the item was just seen.  \nAffordable enough for your keys. Secure enough for everything that matters\nThe two most important things we have been working on during the development of XY are Security and Affordability.  We believe that it is of the utmost importance that any item you use to keep track of your things is secure.  To keep your items safe, we utilize a rotating cipher to keep the information about your tag secure.  The only people who will be able see your tags are the ones that you have given permission.  \nWe also believe that it is very important to keep the price of each unit as low as possible, so you can afford to keep track of all the things that matter. We have been talking to many different manufacturers, and can effectively keep the price of the units down by purchasing a large volume of components. This inventory requirement is the single biggest reason we need your help.  \nCompatibility\nXY uses Bluetooth LE technology, and is compatible with iOS7 devices, as well as Android devices that are equipped with Android version 4.3 and above.  \nColors\nWhen we ship, XY will be available in the following colors:\nDevelopment Timeline\nWe have been hard at work on this for the last 18 months, and we are nearing completion.  \nProof of Concept: We started this project by setting up 2 phones to send/receive Bluetooth signals. From this, we were able to show that we could set a device to alert when another was out of range.\nInitial Prototypes: We bought every different Bluetooth LE chip we could find. We compared battery life, signal strength, signal consistency, and more. In the end, we determined that the CC2541SOC chip had the best performance.\nProduct Design: We started off knowing that we wanted to design a distinctive, stylish shape for our product. We started drawing and carving shapes from wood to test our different styles. Pretty quickly, we decided that we needed to get a 3D printer to start rapid prototyping. After testing different widths, diameters, and faceted shapes before we finally settled on the final XY tag design. \nApp Development:  While all this was going on, Daniel was hard at work on our iPhone App. Today, we have the app nearly completed.  We have made it easy to sync a new tag to your phone. \nTo find a tag that is in range of your phone:\nPLAY\n\nTo see when a tag has gone out of range:\nPLAY\n\nAnd to track where and when a tag was last seen:\nPLAY\n\nWe are working on the finishing touches of the iPhone App, and will be completing the Android App shortly after that.  With the help of Kickstarter, we will be able to manufacture and ship our first tags by June of this year.  Our manufacturing timeline looks like this:\n Help Us Share it\n Rewards\nThe Team \nWhile we have a dedicated team of developers, designers, and engineers at XY, the team is led by these two members:\nDaniel Wang (President):\nDaniel began his long career in technology at the tender age of 12 developing \u201cturbo\u201d loaders for the Commodore 64 (basically it just turned off the display so the 1mhz MOS 6510 could actually do some work).  After getting his CS degree from UCSD, he worked on various projects for Viewpoint (3D rendering), Disney (software for kids) and was the CTO of Xdrive, a cloud storage pioneer acquired by AOL.  In the early 2000\u2019s, he joined a few friends to develop an industry-leading fraud detection system based entirely on numerical analysis of large amounts of financial data \u2014 a system that is still used today by top accounting firms and hedge funds.  Turning his interests to mobile in 2012, he developed two highly-rated collaborative consumption apps Nifty & Nifty Deals, both available in the AppStore.\nNicholas Trouw (Lead Product Designer):\nAn Ohio native, Nick Trouw got his career off the ground beginning in college, where he founded, owned and managed several arts and performance organizations and business ventures. As one of his first, Urban Renaissance Outreach Group worked to increase English fluency scores in underfunded schools across the country. After two years of traveling the U.S. for arts and education, Nick united this experience with his interest in software engineering and became president of a start-up business that worked to create free, online educational resources for teachers and students nationwide. Shortly after, he began contracting for different corporations as a software developer, which led him to do the same at Webble, an indoor event navigation and mapping solution technology. Now, as the lead product designer and software developer for XY, Nick engaged his creativity and arts background to perfect the XY prototype and currently heads the team of developers and engineers to manufacture the tag and app for consumer use.\n So, please help us make the world better with XY.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have already extensively researched and tested various technologies, chips, and enclosures for the XY tags. The biggest challenge we face is being able to purchase manufactured products that integrate both our design and technology in a single facility.

Starting with the original design, we wanted to have a wallet that combined all aspects that you guys loved. We finally decided on the TRIM design and created a wallet that accommodates both the vertical and horizontal usage. \nMinimal one-piece design\nMost wallets have perpendicular slots, which isn't the most effective design. We modified the slots, to have them all at an optimal 30 degree angle, and a curve at the back. This design makes access to the cards easy, but also secure. We did the same for the cash compartment for this wallet. \nFirst prototype with a straight card slot\nThe saffiano leather in the Trim Wallet is stamped in a series of cross-hatch designs rendering it very resistant to stains and scratches. This gives us a slimmer frame for a durable construction to help trim your wallet. The edges are then oil-coated to provide more durability and prevent fraying of the ends. Finally, the cash slot is machine laser-cut in a uniform manner.\nSaffiano Leather - a pressed leather for a lighter, refined look\nWe are also providing a black vegetable tanned leather model for a more rugged wallet that builds character over time. This wallet features a thicker hide and thicker threading, with an ultrasuede lining interior. The edges and threading on this model are waxed and coated. There is also additional threading on the cash slot to reinforce the opening.\nVegetable Tanned Leather - Black\nOur Story:\nLast year, I created the first Dash Wallet project after I couldn\u2019t find the right wallet and I put it up on to Kickstarter. Fortunately, the project was able to get full funding and we were able to lift this venture off the ground. We then assembled an awesome team together and got to work. After months of production, site redesigns, wallet resizing, and logistics organization, we delivered you Dash Wallets, a wallet focused on making your life easier and more organized. We create for the minimalist and hope to slim down your bulky wallets. We do so with the integrity and philosophy of always doing our best to deliver on time, with the best customer service. \nThe Original Dash Wallets\nAfter launching the Dash project, we were able to learn a lot more about the many aspects of crowdfunding. We've been working to improve every step along the way from production costs to shipment methods. This time around, backer rewards can be offered at an affordable pledge for better materials and the process of fulfillment will be much more streamlined. We have always delivered Dash products on time and will continue to do so. And again, the design was inspired by you guys. That's the great thing about Kickstarter. Backers and creators can collaborate to create and deliver better products together. So thank you, Kickstarters.\nProduction:\nAfter numerous assessments on fabrics and blueprints, we have finished designing the wallet using only one piece of material to ensure a minimal frame and durability for a final prototype. We can now start production of the wallets for the public. If successful, the timeline will go as follows:\nWeek 1-2: Gather information through surveys \nWeek 3-4: Organize logistics to start manufacturing\nWeek 8 : Quality control and checkpoints\nWeek 9-12 : Shipment to Kickstarter backers\nNavy Saffiano Leather\nYour Support:\nThis is where Kickstarter comes in again. We need your support to launch this line of wallets. We are raising funding for manufacturing, packaging, and logistics for the TRIM Wallet.

The Dash is awesome for sports and great for everything else.\nThe Dash works in sympathy with the wearer. Movements like pace, steps, cadence and distance are tracked. Heart rate, oxygen saturation and energy spent are measured, all the while real time acoustic feedback is provided. It even works without an attached smartphone.\nSafety and the ability to communicate with others are important. In addition to being earphones, the Dash will double as a Bluetooth Headset delivering clear voice quality through the embedded ear bone microphone. The ear bone microphone is not sensitive to background noise, since it picks up mechanical vibration generated by your voice from the ear bone.\nEven though The Dash provides impressive noise isolation, the wearer can choose to channel ambient sound into the headphone with the transparent audio feature.

Even though we have a close dialog with our suppliers, we are not in control of their actions. Every component is highly integrated into and optimized within the design, and an unforeseen component alteration can delay our launch. \nThe Dash has a complex Bluetooth setup that we have tested vigorously in our labs. We might encounter real life applications, where we cannot guarantee for the quality of operations. We will continue to improve our software throughout the launch to improve functionality.\nThe team has a very strong background in design for manufacturing.

Not able to find a wallet that lets us carry the \u2018in-between\u2019 coins, we decided to make Poquito. A front-pocket wallet that carries your essential: cash, cards, and even coins. A little more than most, yet just enough to maintain a slim profile.\nIt is precision machined from one solid piece of wood - with a custom molded elastomer strap that securely holds everything in place. Each and every Poquito wallet is hand polished, making it a pleasure to handle all-day everyday.\nWood Selection\nBlack Walnut\nGrains are usually straight but patterns such as curl, crotch, and burl can also sometimes be seen. With a moderate natural lustre that will develop patina shine with use. Colour can sometimes have a grey, purple, or reddish cast. Black Walnut is rated highly in terms of durability and decay resistance. Sustainably harvested in Ohio, Midwest US.\nWhite Oak\nColour can vary from nearly white to light brown. Olive cast is often seen with prominent ray fleck pattern. Grain is coarse with larger pores - a prominent feature on Oak. White Oak is very durable, and is often used in boatbuilding. It also has a mellow odour common in Oak, that most people find appealing. Sustainably harvested in New York state, US.\nBlack Cherry (Subject to Stretch Goal)\nClose grain and smooth fine texture. Mostly straight but curly grain patterns are not uncommon. Over time and with exposure to light, the wood will darken into deep golden brown. Black Cherry is well known for being an all-around wood in terms of durability and workability. With high resistance to decay. Sustainably harvested in Ontario, Canada.\nPoquito's quick access groove lets you get to a frequently used card with ease.\nWhite Oak & Black Walnut\nMolded elastomer strap to securely hold up to 6 cards and some cash (Inside and outside)\nPledging for Additional Strap\nEach wallet comes with one strap as a standard (unless we get to our 1000 backers stretch goal). If you'd like to get an additional strap/s please follow the guide to pledge the correct amount:\nCoins are inevitable. We made a little compartment for it - just in case\nPrecision machined wood interior\nThe Madera logo is debossed on the strap and laser-etched on the wood.\nOur Story\nA Modern Wallet\nFor us the ideal wallet is a wallet that we enjoy having in our pocket, feel in our hands, and that simply works. We want something to help us carry 'enough' of the essentials without bulking up our pocket. Poquito is the result of a year designing, prototyping, and refining every details. Making it something we truly enjoy using - everyday.\nBy backing this project you will help us to make our first order and pay for the tooling with an experienced manufacturer. Ensuring the highest of quality and control in production.\nWood & Sustainability\nWood apart from being one of the oldest material known to man, also leave behind smaller carbon footprint and in some cases negative footprint (trees use and store carbon to grow). Requiring less to process in comparison with leather or metal - and continues to store carbon until it is released by burning it.\nEvery Poquito wallet is heat treated, precision cut, hand polished and sealed - to ensure a wallet that will compliment you for years to come.\nMadera = Wood\nOur passion for wood drives us to challenge the convention of what is possible with wood products. We believe in simple and honest design that works to improve our everyday life. We want to make products that create lasting relationship with the users. Wood objects that are made to be loved and to last.\nProcess & Materials\nWe set out to create an open-back shell and rubber strap wallet with ultra simple construction that eliminates unnecessary dividers. With this we wanted to make sure that the cards will still be highly accessible. We prototyped countless straps to ensure the balance between elasticity and reliability. Opting to use molded rubber straps instead of woven elastics for better control in production.\nWalnut, Oak, and Cherry are well known for their workability and resistance to decay. An important factor for us to consider - as the wallet will be exposed to humidity, contact, and everyday wear.\nAn early aluminium sheet mock-up\nProduction Schedule\nAfter a few months of intensive prototyping, we have arrived at a finalised form/function that we are satisfied with.

With PLUGAWAY you can relax. Why? \n\n-> Because with a single tap on your smartphone, you can switch off or on anything you want in your home - by category (such as living room or bedroom) or specifically \u2013 like the coffee maker burning that leftover brew in your kitchen!\nOr what if you keep receiving those electricity bills that just don't make sense, or your family restaurant really needs to be more economically efficient?\n\n-> Now you can know exactly what is costing you what, by hour or day or month\u2026we're already started looking at a 3-phase smart plug for those big pizza ovens, if you thinking what we're thinking :)\nOr what if you want to personalise various moods for different occasions like movie night, party time, or even something more personal?\n\n-> with PLUGAWAY, you can easily set any theme presets that you want, and by simply tapping that theme, your home will take on your personality. \nSelect (or schedule) any mood you've set up for yourself!\nHere\u2019s the BIG DEAL of being OPEN:\nWe're finalising the hardware (waiting for your feedback) and readying it for certification and production. But we'd like to go one dimension further. \nWe want to make this completely open - yes - that means\u2026\n1. Sign it and make it your own: Great for interior designers, restaurant owners, or developers who want to create their own brand. Have your own logo on the app.\n2. Bundle your own app: pre-select any features you want, or will ever need, from our open library - just drag&drop presets, settings, skins, and click 'compile app'. \n3. App sharing: Create you own rules and develop your own app to share with other Plugaway users!\n4. Integrate it: Link it with anything you can think of - this means IFTTT or pair it with your existing smart-home devices or systems (as long as they're open too)\n5. Secure it: As secure as it is, maybe you want additional settings or passwords, adding users - limited or full control - it's really up to you!\n6. Dream it: So, here's the real point. It's entirely up to you what you want to do with it. It's not about having a \"Plugaway\" brand on your smart plug or phone app. Give it your name, we don't mind - it's yours! :)\nHearing about our smart LEDs and open app, video production company Goldshore Media (GS|M) have already shared with us their thinking about where lighting can go.

Look out for news of its opening!\nOur open software means two things. Developers are able to integrate other devices into the app and share their add-ins. The other is that Plugaway will also be compatible with other systems, so you don't even need to use our app unless you absolutely want to! Provided your existing system is open, you may use the Plugaway app's API to connect with your current home-automation system.\nKickstarter is all about empowering the entrepreneurial spirit and gearing creative ideas into real action. It does this by facilitating communication between creators, encouraging the sharing of ideas, and helping us to support each other. It\u2019s easy for a big business to consume and dominate a market. However, we believe that we have something here and we want to share it with you. We want our homes to be ours, and not some corporate machine's. And we believe that you want the same.\nWe don't want to govern the function on your app, that's why we're asking you to help develop it. We don't want to brand your home. We want you to be able to personalise your home.\nWe are doing Kickstarter because of you. Our goal is to raise $50,000. This money will not be used for covering protoyping, production, or material costs. Rather, we will be building on your Kickstarter comments, feedback and pledges, and reinvesting it into the project to make Plugaway the most awesome and open smartplugs and smart LED's on the market. This looks like:\n(60%) passing BS, CE, UL and more quality certification standards\n(20%) paying software engineers to continue improving the app and make it open\n(10%) developing an online library for sharing designs and ideas\n(10%) Kickstarter commission and tax \nWe also need you to help us share this dream. The only way for us to do this, is with your help and support.\n\nEvery comment and pledge counts. \nAs said in the video, smart homes are really amazing but many feel that existing systems are too costly, bulky and limited.Our journey starts from a humble beginning; from a married man with a dream. Encouraged by his wife to follow his personal passion for entrepreneurship, mobile technology, and Wi-Fi connectivity, Richard Cai invested his personal time and energy to free-up his home, and put it onto his smartphone.\nThese actions birthed the PlugAway Project. Initiated under a personal conviction and desire, PlugAway has changed from being a personal dream to a shared vision by a continually growing group of people. Now, we\u2019re inviting you to join the journey! That\u2019s why we are handing you a new, simple and transparent device that you can personalize and call your own. After all, it's for your home!\nOf course the pledges are important and we could not continue without them, but we also want to hear what you guys think about our product and ideas. Don't hesitate! Feel absolutely free to contact us with any questions, comments or ideas you may have. We will be grateful for any feedback and will do our best to answer any message as soon as we can.\nLooking for more app pics or insights into the hardware?

THE SMARTPLUG SHELL\nWe started by creating a big prototype. Shortly after that, we made it into a working smart plug! However, because our backers came with so many good ideas, we decided to pause our previous campaign, and implement all those suggestions. Think we've done it this time!\n[2012.12.10] From Conception to Creation!!\n[2013.03.15] Time to put the big thing into a smaller thing\n[2013.04.03] With all the components ready, we put it all together\n[2013.04.15] Our first version of the Plugaway - ver.1.0\n[2013.07.15] We took your feedback and returned to the drawing board...\n[2013.07.26] And we came up with this! The Plugaway ver. 2.0\n[2013.08.09] Then we modified our design for international markets\nWe've made Type-F, Type-I, Type-G, & Type-B plugs\nThe above pictures show hollow shells and for reference only. There'll need to be certain changes made, such as inserting the PCB! The pictures show appearance and dimensions, we'll need to add grounding pins and do some further work before the Schuko plug is ready.\nBecause of our backers support, we were able to make a black casing as well!\nOur aim is for the smartplug itself to run on only 0.2W and as we are still prototyping, this will need confirmed in a later update. Prototypes are supporting 2500W. In a home scenario with a regular small stereo with standby wattage at 6W, annual energy saving could equate to 53.2kWh at $4.82 saving. Larger appliances such as ACs and TVs can drain several dollars per day if not turned off. Modern appliances are increasingly energy efficient, however energy prices have risen 150% in the past 10 years (UK) and are continuing upwards!\nFridges and freezers may also be connected to Plugaway. Not that you\u2019ll turn them off. But if your freezer breaks down, wouldn\u2019t it be nice to receive a Plugaway alert message before you lose everything in the freezer? Depending how well you stock your freezer, that alert message could save over $100\u2019s.\nOur current Plugaway units are single input devices. You may connect a power strip into a Plugaway, though this will control all appliances at once. We are considering a power strip as a stretch goal. Though more on this in an update later.\n2. THE PLUGAWAY PCB\n[2013.02.02] We designed our first circuit board\n[2013.07.03] After our first Kickstarter campaign, we made it smaller\n[2013.08.03] We also incorporated your suggestions about adding an LED ring\n[2013.09] We all love the colour spectrum of the led-ring - so we've it the best with fiber optics!\nOur shell exterior is complete and we're finalising the PCB - making sure to take on board your comments as we do. We've already received some great feedback and will be considering some changes as follows:\nCAPACITOR: Our prototype pictures show a combination of capacitors (models: 1000U DIP_2.54, 100U X1210, and 1U X0603). However, as we will be applying for RoHS, which relates to the material composition of components, it also infers a consideration towards component quality. We recognise that this inference currently does not align with the quality of capacitor in our shown prototypes and feel that a higher grade capacitor will better ensure long-term durability. We shall confirm our final capacitor selection in a pending update\nCPU: For similar price optimisation, we have chosen the ATmega128 CPU as it utilises a low-power AVR 8-bit Microcontroller and offers a performance that satisfies all of the requirements for efficient control. During prototyping, we have emphasised design, quality and stability. Though we recognise that energy efficiency is important for providing maximum value to you as a user. We will be exploring ways to further improve its energy consumption before release. Our aim is for 0.2W, but this is subject to change depending upon further modifications. The question concerning balance between efficiency and affordability is a critical question, and we take great care when making our decisions.\nWIFI CHIP: The above pictures show connection to an 802.11b/g network via a Marvell 88W8686 Wi-Fi chip, originally chosen due to lower cost (meaning cheaper prices for you). However, our final model will connect to an 802.11n network to offer increased range. The exact Wi-Fi chip to be used is still to be determined. Furthermore, our choice for Wi-Fi technology over bluetooth permits increased range and allows each Plugaway to have a separate IP address, offering potential for 252 Plugaway\u2019s to be connected to a standard single household network. \n3. THE SMART LEDS\nThe internal LEDs are type 14x3528, and are shelled within an aluminum electroplated cooling housing with a silver finish.The bulb is custom made by Iwan to overcome common heating problems. \n\nA key component of this cooling principle is to use the ectoplasm aluminum due to its higher heat disapation and ability to direct heat away from the LEDs faster than other materials\n[2012.12] Iwan checks out the cooling body on his first prototype\n[2013.08] We explored the opportunities of making a Smart LED\n[2013.09.06] We made the PCB even smaller and tested it with LED bulbs..\n[2013.10.11] Our smart LED bulb, looking good so far...but more still to be done\nThe custom made frosted acrylic LED bulb is fully compatible with each of the out-of-the-box features above (scheduling, energy monitoring etc), the LED bulb uses just 6Ws of power and an estimated lifespan of 30,000 hours. At a 450-500lm output it compares to a regular 50W halogen bulb, thus able to provide energy savings of 85%. It also has an A++ energy label and its E27 fixture is the most regular and common bulb fixture around. What does E27 mean? Named after the designer, this 'Edison Screw' (E) tip bulb has a diameter of 27mm (27).\nIwan has been experimenting with a wide range of bulb designs since 2004, which has seen him work on some interesting projects including a car showroom, underwater pool lights, and just plain old weird architecture, as well as regular interior design projects. The bulb used for this project was first prototyped by Iwan in December 2012 (as shown above). Following Plugaway's first Kickstarter campaign, Iwan and the Plugaway team started collaborating together since June to produce the smart LED (name to be chosen by you!). Plugaway then utilised Iwan's LED design expertise and modified their wi-fi technology to fit the PCB inside the bulb, as well as offer a dimming function and are working on an RGB control option that will be fully revealed in a coming update. Footage from the first public demonstration will be uploaded on Youtube in mid-November. This Kickstarter bulb is just the first of many more designs to come. As further suggested below, we'll be looking together at integrating the LEDs into the default Plugaway app.\n4. SMART-PLUG POWER STRIP\nWhat's in the power strip?\n4X plug sockets (same geographical regions as regular smart plug)\n1X heat sensor (for monitoring room temperature)\n2X USB slots \n\nEach plug socket may be individually or group controlled from the smartphone app, or manually on the power strip. Each plug socket will have its own LED to indicate the socket state (on/off) Regular USBs use 500mA, but we\u2019ll look to offer up to 1.5A support (5volt and 7.5watt). As such, we\u2019ll have compatibility with an increased range of devices. The possibility of offering a USB data storage feature was also suggested. This sounded great. But to do this would require upgrading the CPU to handle data transfer, which would then require additional power for operation. As one of our key points is to reduce power consumption and facilitate energy saving, we seek to minimise our own power demands. There\u2019d also be additional security issues being raised during data transfer.\nFor the power strip, we won\u2019t personally be financing the development and will be looking for Kickstarter to cover the development costs. As such, we have budgeted a small margin into the pricing to cover arising costs. Equally, we\u2019re continuing with our theme of affordability, so we\u2019ll be noticeably cheaper than the majority of other smart power strips out there.\nThe general consensus has been favourable towards the classical power strip shape rather than a curved or cubed shape. We particularly like the succinct reasoning of Mark Rutledge, essentially highlighting factors including design speed, development cost and design complexity, as well as the regulatory environment, as favouring the classical strip.\nYou can read more on the progress in our updates\n5. APP DESIGN\nWhilst the Plugaway switch looks good, our free app is the backbone and central nervous system for everything that we're doing! We've spent (and are still spending) hours on optimising our app from a three-pronged approach that balances aesthetics, functionality and simplicity.\n[DIM/SWITCH] App Prototype ver 1.0, New concept, Prototype ver 2.0 (right)\nWe're currently developing for Android and iOS, but we aspire to have Windows available by summer 2014.\nYou can see from the above app shots that we have come a long way since our first prototype, and we're looking forward to showing you more as we progress throughout this campaign. \nOur summary schedule is:\nPresent - Jan 2014: Complete our freely downloadable app with core functions\nJan - Mar 2014: Develop a 'creative space' and open library on our website \nFeb - Mar 2014: Application to Google Play and the App Store\nApr 2014: App release...time to party!!!\nWe will also be providing free server access so that you can store your energy history. And just in case anybody is wondering, the smart plugs and lights will all be compatible with the app!\n5. FACTORY PRODUCTION\nThe Plugaway Project is overseen by Torrap Designs Limited, a public company registered in Australia. However, we're operating from mainland China. Why???\nOne of the biggest challenges for many hardware companies/projects is finding reliable, stable and suitable partners - particularly at the production level! We approached this challenge with simple logic, build a relationship with the factories. To do this, we set-up our office just a 45 minutes drive from two of Beijing's factory districts, employed locals, and make frequent visits.\nRather than frequently fly between continents, we changed continents!\nWe want our partners to work together to create a quality driven and sustainable supply chain. Being close to our future production partners is not merely enough. We require an Initial Factory Audit/Inspection as part of our factory selection process. The objective is to assist us with conducting due diligence throughout our supply chain; as we ourselves continually strive to meet our aim of being transparent and accountable to our multiple stakeholders. Our Initial Factory Audit/Inspection evaluates the capability of a Factory to produce products within a consistent and sustainable Manufacturing process.\nWithin the context of the above statement, sustainable refers to two areas. Firstly: a Factory\u2019s convergence with statutory United Nations (UN) and International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions and documents on areas such as Safe, Healthy and Hygienic Working Conditions (ILO Convention No.155 and ILO Recommendation No.164); Adequate Wages and Compensation (ILO Convention No.26 and 131); No Excessive Working Time (ILO Convention No.1 and 14), and other areas as deemed appropriate. Secondly: a Factory\u2019s environmental and energy use procedures. In relation to TS 16949, Factory\u2019s should be able to demonstrate a strategy for waste reduction, improving electrical and energy efficiency, and responsible purchasing \u2013 at very least in areas pertinent to Torrap (our name).\nManufacturing process relates to the Manufacturer\u2019s Quality Management System, Assembly Line, Inspection and Testing Procedures, and Facilities and Equipment. In addition to our own onsite visit, this is importantly inferred through current receipt of relevant certification standards, such as ISO 9001.\nDuring prototyping, we have printed our PCBs with Beijing KDS Electronics Co., Ltd and our shell with Beijing Rapid Precision Tooling Co., Ltd. They are each well recognised and between them produce for companies such as Audi, Panasonic Electric, Sony and Volkswagen. Any changes to our suppliers will be disclosed within future sustainability reporting\nA note on certification: Assurance of quality goes well beyond receipt of certifications. However, we will still be applying for certification for each geographical market: America (UL498), Australia and New Zealand (AS3112), Britain (BS 1363), China (CCC) and Europe (CE 7/7). Note that some countries may not be covered under these certification standards. We will additionally opt for application towards a material certification standard (RoHS) and environmental standard (WEEE).\nFree Developer Kit to ALL!  \nWe're offering all of you an open-access zone where anyone and everyone can build their own styled and self-branded app. This will include an open access library that offers a range of presets for you to bundle together as you please, and also provides a space for you to show-off your app interface, skins, etc., and share it with other Plugaway users.\nPledge levels\nFor those who missed the early bird 20% discount rate, don't worry, Plugaway devices are still available at a great value.\nTimely fulfilment of our pledges to you means a lot to us! We endeavour to meet all of our commitments to you and promise to notify you in the event of any change. \nAnd remember, you can top-up with more devices later!\nWanting Plugaway as a gift?\nChristmas is coming & the New Year is around the corner.

Plugaway devices may be further protected by three rounds of passwords. First, your household Wi-Fi network password is required. Second, you can apply a password to your app. And thirdly, you can assign a password to any individual appliance. This for example, allows you to share control for all appliances with anyone you choose just by sharing your passwords; whilst, for example, also being able to prevent them from playing pranks and waking you by turning on your bedroom light during the night!\n\nMaintaining stability: Plugaway uses a server for three reasons. Firstly to allow phone control beyond the scope of your home network. Secondly, each device has a memory span of approximately 6 months. To ensure efficient operations, we upload information to the cloud and refresh the memory of your device. Third, few people have access to a personal server, so we provide server access for free. \nAlthough we'll be looking at renting space on international servers prior to launch (such as amazon), our current server is operated by WanWang (www.net.cn) in Zhejiang Province, China. This is for practical reasons as we have been developing the project in China. Well recognised as China's leading internet services provider, WanWang has one of the worlds\u2019 top IDC rooms with independent IP, optical access and line redundancy, INTEL multi-core server platforms and a DDT backup system. This is accompanied by its real-time monitoring system and equipment maintainance, supporting its 24/7 operational guarantee. Utilised by China's equivalent of Google (Baidu), Youtube (Youku), Twitter (Weibo) etc, WanWang's operational stability has a direct influence upon China's economic stability. As such, WanWang provide a 24/7 operational guarantee, and report 365 days of uninterrupted service annually. In the unlikely event of a server crash, your Plugaway devices will remain operational. However, we have programmed a default safety feature that will only permit recognised and secure networks to control your devices. This will usually be limited to your household Wi-Fi network. We shall review our international server selection before final launch and - in a similar style to above - provide rationale behind the decision. Note also that there's no obligation to use our server, it is simply there as a free service to regular users without their own personal server.

Most of us still consider lighting in our home as a collection of lamps that produce light. But a collection of lamps doesn\u2019t necessarily create good lighting. Innr isn\u2019t about lamps. It\u2019s about great lighting, for every moment and every activity in your home. \nEver wondered how all those glossy interior design magazines manage to showcase these beautiful homes with the lighting just right?\nEver been put off by the price of a professional lighting plan? \nAt Innr we believe every home deserves great lighting at every moment of the day. It\u2019s why we\u2019re here: to make great lighting accessible to everyone. Outside you\u2019ve got the sun, inside you\u2019ve got Innr. \nHow does it work ?\nStep 1. The online Light Advisor\nAt Innr.com we'll create a personal online lighting plan for you, tailored to your home: \nSimply start by sketching the dimensions of your room\nIndicate where the room\u2019s fixed features are, such as doors and windows.\nAdd your furniture and any beautiful belongings you\u2019d like to accentuate.\nPress enter\u2026 \nand you have your personalised lighting plan. As well as all the products you need to make it happen, ready to be delivered to your home. \nGet your personalised lighting plan in three easy steps\nStep 2. Installation \nOnce your order has arrived you\u2019re ready for step two. Installation is quick and easy with the personalised lighting plan of your room and the contents of your order: state-of-the-art Innr LED spots, easy-to-install strips and bulbs, an internet bridge, and everything else needed to achieve the transformation of your room.\nStep 3. The Innr experience\nWith the installation complete, you\u2019re ready for the final step. After logging into your Innr account via the app on your smart device, you\u2019ll be shown tailor-made settings for different moods and activities, based on the personal lighting plan created for your room. \nWith a single screen tap you can adjust the lighting to fit your current mood or activity. For dining, relaxing, having friends round, working from home or doing homework with the kids. Innr provides great lighting for everything you do, including when you\u2019re doing nothing much and just want to relax. \nOther Innr benefits\nWhere do we stand ?\nWhat started with a vision to empower people to be able to create better lighting at home, has now materialized into fully functional software and prototypes that are ready for mass production.\nThe online lighting advisor has undergone numerous iterations and reviews with consumers and lighting designers to make sure that the interface is simple and the advice is top notch. We\u2019re happy with the results so we plan to release a beta version next month.\nWe've built many prototypes of the lighting products so we can be sure they deliver the lighting quality and ease of installation we promise. The designs have been finalized and the first tools have been ordered. We've been really fortunate to be able to work with an international team of outstanding design partners and suppliers who have thought with us every step of the way, using their experience gained from working for leading lighting and electronics brands.\nWhat's next ?\nIn four months' time we expect to deliver the first orders. While we continue to tweak the software, the biggest step now is to order tooling, start production and go through certification so that we can start shipping. Meanwhile we are working on brand development, marketing positioning, packaging, and all the other of other major details that are needed to bring Innr to life.\nThe planning:\nNovember: Tool making, pilot production & certification. Beta version light advisor live\nDecember: Start production. light advisor refinements\nJanuary: First shipments from supplier. Light advisor version 1.0 live\nFebruary: Start fulfillment Kickstarter rewards\nMarch: All Kickstarter rewards delivered\nWhy Kickstarter ?\nWe\u2019ve come a long way over the past year with the creation of Innr. We think it will revolutionize the way people light their homes. Your support will allow us to order tools and start up production so that we can make Innr available to you and everyone interested in personalised great lighting. More importantly, as part of the Kickstarter community, you'll not only be supporting us with crowd funding, but also with great ideas and feedback to help make Innr even better. We\u2019re keen to receive your sharp and insightful reviews. The claim we make is a substantial one, and we really want Innr to live up to it. Use it, test it, give us your thoughts.\nThe rewards\n The Innr team\nAn international bunch who all believe in the magical power of light to enrich homes and interiors. Our vision and passion lie in the desire to change the way people experience lighting.\nIn our 'office'\nThanks for your support !\nWe\u2019re delighted to be able to share the Innr journey with you, and hope you\u2019ll join us in our mission to change the way people think about lighting.

Innr, with its technical complexity, has been no exception. The good news is that some of the biggest risks on our journey in creating Innr now lie behind us. \n\nWe've had to develop software that can provide sound lighting advice and the results we believe in. We also wanted to develop top quality led products that are smaller than anything available on the market. To top it all, we wanted to develop a reliable wireless control system that could be programmed through the lighting advisor. We're proud to say we managed to achieve all of our objectives. Innr has been created thanks to a great team with the right experience and ambition and first-class suppliers who are ready to get going with manufacturing Innr for us. \n\nIn the next phase the main risks are in production delays, release test hiccups and software bugs. For the most typical risks, we have identified ways to minimize them and to resolve them if they should crop up. Nevertheless, you can never eliminate sheer bad luck.
