[{"backer": "Wendy Yang Bailey", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "A Father\u2019s Son is story-spinoff based on author Henry Chang\u2019s crime novel series featuring NYPD Detective Jack Yu. Set in the early '90s when local street gangs terrorized Manhattan\u2019s Chinatown, our story centers on Detective Jack Yu investigating the murder of a teenage boy involved in a turf war. Amidst the broad distrust and racial divide between the Chinatown community and NYPD, our lone lawman searches for a nondescript immigrant family to deliver a shattering message that also brings forth his own conflicted relationship with Jack\u2019s father.  \nSince 2006, Henry Chang\u2019s posters of his crime drama book series, Chinatown Beat, Year of The Dog, Red Jade, and Death Money were displayed at my two favorite NYC Chinatown restaurants: 69 Bayard and Wo Hop City. The posters caught my attention for years until I purchased his first book titled Chinatown Beat.  \nAfter reading the first installment, I became enamored with the fictional character Jack Yu, a NYPD Detective torn between justice and the injustice to his community. He was a born-and-bred New Yorker with a New Yawk accent trying to do good. It was the first time reading about a Chinese-American protagonist who wasn\u2019t an American stereotype. Jack wasn\u2019t a cook, waiter, deliveryman, an herbalist, railroad worker, opioid dealer, martial artist, monk or Manchu.   \nPositive Asian-American role models were invisible unless it was Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan and Jet Li, or another martial art figure. Only little known-actor Dennis Gong Dun came close portraying a Chinese-American protagonist in Year of the Dragon as Herbert Kwong, and as Wang Chi in Big Trouble in Little China. But that was only around 1980s.\nNot all of us know Kung-Fu - The Slanted Screen\nToday, thanks to organizations like Gold House and box-office hits like Crazy Rich Asians, there\u2019s a genuine opportunity for good stories with tangible Asian-American characters. It\u2019s been 13 years since the release of Chinatown Beat and I felt this was the right time to bring Jack Yu to light in our story, A Father\u2019s Son. \nI grew up watching Hong Kong '90s films. The three films I wrote and directed, Love Express, Confucius Plaza, and The Last Tip were inspired by Hong Kong\u2019s cinematic style and natural realism -- which have been showcased at the Museum of Chinese in America and Comcast's Xfinity Lunar New Year collection.   \nFilms by Patrick Xi Hao Chen\nWith A Father\u2019s Son I want to direct it as a film noir with reference to Johnnie To\u2019s PTU (2003) and Election (2005). I want to exhibit the grittiness of New York\u2019s Chinatown with the Cantonese essence that will simulate 1994.\nThe first step is to hire professional actors who can speak that dialect. The second is to collaborate with a cinematographer that can capture the vision. And lastly, location, location and location. A talented location manager and set designer will help us camouflage the slowly gentrifying 2019 NYC Chinatown into its 1994 iconic setting. In this Sinovision interview, Henry and I speak a bit about the change in Chinatown through the years with the cast of The Last Tip.\nProducing a film can be challenging an expensive, especially one set in the early 1990s. We've enlisted help from as many talented individuals who could generously offer up their time and effort to make this project a reality. But favors do have their limits. That's why we need your help. \nEvery contribution will go towards the creation of A Father's Son in its entirety -- from pre-production to distribution. This includes reimbursing actors, crew members, editors, sound designers, composers, and all the many specialized roles needed to get this project off the ground, as well as film festival submission fees and network marketing.\nOur hopes is that A Father\u2019s Son will gain enough interest to have Henry Chang\u2019s books developed into a network series. It\u2019s a long shot but audiences are now hungering for diverse original shows. After nearly 2 decades, Henry Chang will finally get a chance to see his characters come to life.\nClick any of the links above to connect with us and help spread the word to raise awareness about this project.

We're more than ready to own our own business - to be our own bosses, and to put back into our community in a way that's true to our vision of what good food, good service, and good business practice can be. We're also both dads, and want to support our families in a way that's sustainable for the long term, feels (and tastes) good, and makes our kids proud. \n\"Pie is Yummy,\" by Vincent's daughter Cora\nOur Theory\nPie is easy to love; putting good food in a pie shell is only enhancing it. Pie is a comfort food, and that\u2019s something we hope to offer our customers through our pies. \nLemon strawberry chess pie\nHow It Will Work\nThis Kickstarter campaign will raise funds to build out a kitchen in what is currently an office space in The Mothlight, a music venue and bar in West Asheville. A \"pie window\" will allow customers to walk in off the street for a quick bite, and enable Mothlight customers to enjoy a hand pie while having a drink and watching some bands. \nFor more detail about our set up, cooking methods, and menu you can read a Mountain Xpress profile here.\nFor visitors to The Mothlight, we offer the convenience of not having to interrupt their evening to leave the venue in order to eat something delicious and affordable. As the only business exclusively selling pies in Asheville, we also hope to be a destination spot - bringing Asheville residents and visitors to Haywood Road.\nSignature Woodpecker pies\nOur Pies are HAND Pies!\nOur signature item will be hand pies. What are hand pies, you ask? Hand pies are personal size pies that fit into the palm of your hand, and can be consumed free of silverware. Don't worry, though, we'll also be offering whole 9\" pies for holidays and special orders.\nWoodpecker Pie will offer slow fast food. We'll have a small menu with staple pies - three savory options, and two sweet options - with seasonal specials. Our menu will always be guided by quality over quantity. We will use only high quality ingredients, locally-sourced when possible. We will never use anything factory-farmed. This will ensure that our pies are seasonal, and that they sustain our local food culture at the same time that they sustain our customers.\nWe want as many people as possible to feel that we offer something that they want to eat; that\u2019s why we\u2019ll always offer vegetarian and gluten free options. While we don\u2019t currently have the capacity to offer a vegan pie option (we\u2019d need to produce a third pie dough), we hope to do so in the future. Vegan pies are available, however, through special order.\nCaramelized onion & kale pies\nOur Neighborhood\nWe want the Pie Shop to be part of the West Asheville neighborhood. Part of that is having a price point that is accessible to people who live and work here in our community. By having a small staff - currently the two co-owners are the two employees - our customers will get to know us at the same time they\u2019re getting to know our pies. This is our business, and we want to be here.\nOur Request\n$15,000 is a lot of money.

Will the fortress hold?  Or will Evelyn's Magick destroy the fragile strands of sanity these women have left?  \nEvelyn is a mash-up/ riff/ love letter to the classic take down tale,* the stranger comes to town story,** and every hidden memory we\u2019ve ever written down in a notebook spliced and bitten off in a homey kind of way***.  The performers will use their voices and whatever catch as catch-can instruments we find to create a rich, multilayered and exclusively organic soundtrack. Nellie Tinder\u2019s unique stylization of movement and text explores the relationship of reality to artifice, even in the most dramatic of situations. \n*See Othello, Cousin Bette, The Sweet Smell of Success, etc.\n**See The Pied Piper, Playboy of the Western World, etc. \n***Like that embarrassing period in high school when you talked with an English accent.\nThe Bushwick Starr will present Evelyn in their spring season, February 21st to March 10th, 2012.\nWe have shown excerpts of Evelyn at the Obie-Award winning performance series Little Theater and the acclaimed Catch! Performance series, and have gotten overwhelmingly positive feedback about the work we\u2019ve done so far.

An intensive three week reworking of the show will prepare us for three performances at Center Stage Theater in Santa Barbara on August 10th, 11th, & 12th, followed by three performances at the Robert Moss Theatre in New York City on August 18th, 19th, & 20th.\nBy reaching our goal of $20,000, we\u2019ll be able to cover the costs of pre-production, production, transportation, accommodations, rehearsal space, performance space, labor, and all the other real world expenses we must negotiate in order to do what we love to do. With a successful campaign, we won\u2019t have to do anything during the rehearsal process but dive in, and that is priceless.\nWe owe everything to the strength of our community, and to those of you who have been with us from the start, we owe a special thanks to you.
